Comments on ”Oriental magic mirrors and the Laplacian image”

Abstract

We make some remarks on Berry’s paper [Eur. J. Phys. 27 (2006) 109-118].

Berry just presented a comprehensive explanation of the physical part for the optics of the
magic mirror [1]. The story related to this strange metal mirror could be traced in [2-4]. The

characteristic is : the raised images appeared in a screen are on the opposite side of an opaque

mirror but not the reﬂecting face [5-6]! This amazing optical eﬀect for many centuries made

a tremendous impression on observers, from which such mirrors became known as magical.

Master craftsmen passed down the secret of their fabrication from generation to generation.

The ancients were unable to give the phenomenon a convincing explanation, but it was reﬂected

in the old saying ”the truth always comes out in the sun.” [5-6].

In fact, archeological ﬁnds contain extremely scanty information on the magic mirrors of China.

One of the ﬁrst such mirrors was discovered during excavations of the tomb of the exalted grandee

Yu in the province of Uhan in the south of China and has been dated to approximately 500 B.C.

These years belong to the Han period of history, when, in the fabrication of mirrors, special

signiﬁcance was attached to the purity of the metal. The necessity for such careful fabrication of

the mirrors was caused by ritual-magical purposes; these were often reﬂected in inscriptions and

images on the mirrors, which were supposed to keep evil forces away from their owners (cf. Fig.

2 in [6])!. Faith in the power and magical properties of these symbols in Han China was very

widespread. Other legend is : the reverse side of the mirrors bore raised images and inscriptions

of lyrical, symbolic, and edifying content: ”a wise man uses his mind like a mirror” [6].

In China, attempts were made from ancient times to explain the production of the remarkable

optical eﬀect created by magic mirrors. The ﬁrst version that has come down to us apparently

belongs to the scholar Kua Shen (1031-1095)!

[4]. He explained this phenomenon by saying

that, in casting, the thinner part cools faster than the thick part, and this causes the formation

of small deformations of the proﬁle, not observable by the naked eye. At the same time, he

pointed out that very thin mirrors did not manifest this property, and gave credit to the high

skill of the ancients. At the end of the thirteenth century, Dzhou Mi observed a mirror that

reproduced in reﬂected light the ﬁnest details of the image on the back side.

The archeologist Uchkhi Ien gives another explanation of the eﬀect, associating it with the use

of bimetals of diﬀerent density. Thus, if an image of a dragon was created on the back side by

casting, the image was engraved on the front side and was then ﬁlled with bronze of another

density, after which the surface was carefully polished. He saw such a mirror that had been cut

1

2

apart and was absolutely certain that his explanation was correct [6]. Other attempts could be

traced in [1-2].

In such an interesting regime of geometrical optics, the image intensity could be given simply

by the Laplacian of the height function of the relief as Berry demonstrated in [1]. For instance,

Berry used the error function (cf. Eqn. (14) in [1]) to model smoothly and approximately the

single step (the l-smoothed step, with height h0). The present author, however, likes to propose

another way : use T anh (hyperbolic tangent function) to model the sharp step. It reads

(1)

h(x) = C0h0

lt = a0l,

ex/lt − e−x/lt
ex/lt + e−x/lt ,

C0 is a normalization constant and a0 is a constant for adjusting the sharpness. The result and

comparison is shown in Figure 1. There is no doubt that our proposal could be either smooth

(enough for the Laplace operator) or sharp enough (to approximate the step). The obtained

function could be easily implemeted in

ILaplacian = 1 + Z∇2

h(r),

Z = 2D/M,

where D is the distance of the scrreen from the reference plane, M is the magniﬁcation, Z is
the reduced distance, and r is the demagniﬁed observation position [1].
Meanwhile, as commented by Berry in [1] : ”It is possible that there are diﬀerent types of magic

mirror, where for example the relief is etched directly onto the reﬂecting surface and protected

by a transparent ﬁlm [7], but these do not seem to be common. Sometimes, the pattern reﬂected

onto a screen is diﬀerent from that on the back, but this is probably a trick, achieved by attaching

a second layer of bronze, diﬀerently embossed, to the back of the mirror.”. Berry only brieﬂy

discussed the manner in which the pattern embossed on the back gets reproduced on the front

at the end of [1] : ”Referring to (11), this involves the sign of the coeﬃcient a in the relation

between hback and h. There have been several speculations about the formation of the relief.
One is that the relief is generated while the mirror is cooling, by unequal contraction of the

thick and thin parts of the pattern [8]; it is not clear what sign of a this leads to. Another [9] is

that cooling generates stresses, and that during vigorous grinding and polishing the thin parts

yield more than the thick parts, leading to the thick parts being worn down more; this leads

to a < 0. However, this seems to contradict the observations, which point ﬁrmly to a > 0 :

bright (dark) lines on the image, indicating low (high) sides of the steps on the reﬂecting face,

are associated with the low (high) sides of the steps on the back (cf. ﬁgure 7(a) in [1]), not the

reverse (cf. ﬁgure 7(b) in [1]).”. Here, the present author would like to mention the signiﬁcance

of the material which made the strange mirror.

As reported in [6], a mirror of the same size and thickness as the Han mirror was fabricated in

the University of modern China. They used a mirror from the Shanghai museum as a model for

the casting. The copy was fabricated from an alloy containing 73% copper, 23% tin, and 4%

lead. After cooling, the mirror was ground to a thickness of 0.5mm in the thin places. When

the copy was illuminated, it behaved exactly like the original. This could be compared to those

larger magic mirrors, now found in various collections, belong to the period of government of the

Ming dynasty (1368-1644). They are distinguished by the size and character of the images. The

3

reﬂective surface was made somewhat convex and was carefully polished by means of a mercury

amalgam. The back side often had intricate images of birds, ﬂowers, or dragons or scenes

from mythology. The spread in height of the relief is about 25%. The production technique

was casting, using the lost-wax technique. One of the largest of such mirrors, fabricated later

in China, in 1875, is 52 cm in diameter and 1.3 cm thick and weighs more than 12 kg. As

with other Chinese mirrors, it is fabricated from bronze, being an alloy of copper (80%), tin

(15%), and lead (5%) [6]. Finally, from all previous information, it is evident that, in the image

obtained on a screen, dark zones appear where the light is deﬂected by convex microsections of

the surface corresponding to the thinner regions of the mirror, while bright zones are formed by

ﬂat microsections corresponding to the thicker regions. Parts of the latter were illustrated in [1]

clearly.

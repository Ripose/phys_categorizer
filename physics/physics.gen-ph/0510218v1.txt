Dynamical Fractal 3-Space and the
Generalised Schr¨odinger Equation:
Equivalence Principle and Vorticity Eﬀects

The new dynamical ‘quantum foam’ theory of 3-space is described at the clas-
sical level by a velocity ﬁeld. This has been repeatedly detected and for which
the dynamical equations are now established. These equations predict 3-space
‘gravitational wave’ eﬀects, and these have been observed, and the 1991 De-
Witte data is analysed to reveal the fractal structure of these ‘gravitational
waves’. This velocity ﬁeld describes the diﬀerential motion of 3-space, and the
various equations of physics must be generalised to incorporate this 3-space
dynamics. Here a new generalised Schr¨odinger equation is given and analysed.
It is shown that from this equation the equivalence principle may be derived
as a quantum eﬀect, and that as well this generalised Schr¨odinger equation
determines the eﬀects of vorticity of the 3-space ﬂow, or ‘frame-dragging’, on
matter, and which is being studied by the Gravity Probe B (GP-B) satellite
gyroscope experiment.

Introduction

Extensive experimental evidence [1, 2, 3] has shown that a complex dynamical 3-space un-
derlies reality. The evidence involves the repeated detection of the motion of the earth
relative to that 3-space using Michelson interferometers operating in gas mode [3], particu-
larly the experiment by Miller [4] in 1925/26 at Mt.Wilson, and the coaxial cable RF travel
time measurements by Torr and Kolen in Utah in 1981, and the DeWitte experiment in
1991 in Brussels [3]. All such 7 experiments are consistent with respect to speed and direc-
tion. It has been shown that eﬀects caused by motion relative to this 3-space can mimic the
formalism of spacetime, but that it is the 3-space that is ‘real’, simply because it is directly
observable [1].

The 3-space is in diﬀerential motion, that is one part has a velocity relative to other
parts, and so involves a velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) description. To be speciﬁc this velocity ﬁeld
must be described relative to a frame of observers, but the formalism is such that the
dynamical equations for this velocity ﬁeld must transform covariantly under a change of
observer. As shown herein the experimental data from the DeWitte experiment shows that
v(r, t) has a fractal structure. This arises because, in the absence of matter, the dynamical
equations for v(r, t) have no scale. This implies that the diﬀerential motion of 3-space

1

manifests at all scales. This fractal diﬀerential motion of 3-space is missing from all the
fundamental equations of physics, and so these equations require a generalisation. Here we
report on the necessary generalisation of the Schr¨odinger equation, and which results in
some remarkable results: (i) the equivalence principle emerges, as well as (ii) the eﬀects of
vorticity of this velocity ﬁeld. These two eﬀects are thus seen to be quantum-theoretic eﬀects,
i.e. consequences of the wave nature of matter. The equivalence principle, as originally
formulated by Galileo and then Newton, asserts that the gravitational acceleration of an
object is independent of its composition and speed. However we shall see that via the
vorticity eﬀect, the velocity of the object does aﬀect the acceleration by causing rotations.
It has been shown [1, 5] that the phenomenon of gravity is a consequence of the time-
dependence and inhomogeneities of v(r, t). So the dynamical equations for v(r, t) give rise
to a new theory of gravity, when combined with the generalised Schr¨odinger equation, and
the generalised Maxwell and Dirac equations. The equations for v(r, t) involve the New-
tonian gravitational constant G and a dimensionless constant that determines the strength
of a new spatial self-interaction eﬀect, which is missing from both Newtonian Gravity and
General Relativity. Experimental data has revealed [1, 5] the remarkable discovery that
this constant is the ﬁne structure constant α ≈ 1/137. This dynamics then explains numer-
ous gravitational anomalies, such as the bore hole g anomaly, the so-called ‘dark matter’
anomaly in the rotation speeds of spiral galaxies, and that the eﬀective mass of the necessary
black holes at the centre of spherical matter systems, such as globular clusters and spherical
galaxies, is α/2 times the total mass of these systems. This prediction has been conﬁrmed
by astronomical observations [6].

The occurrence of α suggests that space is itself a quantum system undergoing on-
going classicalisation. Just such a proposal has arisen in Process Physics [1] which is an
information-theoretic modelling of reality. There quantum space and matter arise in terms
of the Quantum Homotopic Field Theory (QHFT) which, in turn, may be related to the
standard model of matter. In the QHFT space at this quantum level is best described as a
‘quantum foam’. So we interpret the observed fractal 3-space as a classical approximation
to this ‘quantum foam’.

While here we investigate the properties of the generalised Schr¨odinger equation, anal-
ogous generalisations of the Maxwell and Dirac equations, and in turn the corresponding
generalisations to the quantum ﬁeld theories for such systems, may also be made. In the
case of the Maxwell equations we obtain the light bending eﬀects, including in particular
gravitational lensing, caused by the 3-space diﬀerential and time-dependent ﬂow.

2 The Physics of 3-Space

Because of the dominance of the spacetime ontology, which has been the foundation of
physics over the last century, the existence of a 3-space as an observable phenomenon has
been overlooked, despite extensive experimental detection over that period, and earlier.
This spacetime ontology is distinct from the role of spacetime as a mathematical formalism
implicitly incorporating some real dynamical eﬀects, though this distinction is rarely made.
Consequently the existence of 3-space has been denied, and so there has never been a
dynamical theory for 3-space. In recent years this situation has dramatically changed. We
brieﬂy summarise the key aspects to the dynamics of 3-space.

Relative to some observer 3-space is described by a velocity ﬁeld v(r, t). It is important
to note that the coordinate r is not itself 3-space, rather it is merely a label for an element of
3-space that has velocity v, relative to some observer. This will become more evident when

2

we consider the necessary generalisation of the Schr¨odinger equation. Also it is important
to appreciate that this ‘moving’ 3-space is not itself embedded in a ‘space’; the 3-space is
all there is, although as noted above its deeper structure is that of a ‘quantum foam’.

In the case of zero vorticity ∇ × v = 0 the 3-space dynamics is given by, in the non-

relativistic limit,

These forms are mandated by Galilean covariance under change of observer1. This non-
relativistic modelling of the dynamics for the velocity ﬁeld gives a direct account of the
various phenomena noted above. A generalisation to include vorticity and relativistic eﬀects
of the motion of matter through this 3-space is given in [1]. From (1) and (2) we obtain
that

where

∇.g = −4πGρ − 4πGρDM ,

ρDM (r) =

((trD)2 − tr(D2)).

α
32πG

In this form we see that if α → 0, then the acceleration of the 3-space elements is given
by Newton’s Law of Gravitation, in diﬀerential form. But for a non-zero α we see that the
3-space acceleration has an additional eﬀect, the ρDM term, which is an eﬀective ‘matter
density’ that mimics the new self-interaction dynamics. This has been shown to be the
origin of the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies. It is important to note that
(4) does not determine g directly; rather the velocity dynamics in (1) must be solved, and
then with g subsequently determined from (3). Eqn.(4) merely indicates that the resultant
non-Newtonian aspects to g could be mistaken as being the result of a new form of matter,
whose density is given by ρDM . Of course the saga of ‘dark matter’ shows that this actually
happened, and that there has been a misguided and fruitless search for such ‘matter’.

The numerous experimental conﬁrmations of (1) imply that Newtonian gravity is not
universal at all. Rather a key aspect to gravity was missed by Newton because it so happens
that the 3-space self-interaction dynamics does not necessarily explicitly manifest outside
of spherical matter systems, such as the sun. To see this it is only necessary to see that the
velocity ﬁeld

gives, using (3), the resultant external ‘inverse square law’ acceleration

2 )M + ... Then (6)

g(r) = −

GM ′

(7)

Hence in this special case the 3-space dynamics predicts an inverse square law form for g,
as conﬁrmed in the non-relativistic regime by Kepler’s laws for planetary motion, with only
a modiﬁed value for the eﬀective mass M ′. So for this reason we see how easy it was for
Newton to have overlooked a velocity formalism for gravity, and so missed the self-interaction
dynamics in (1). Inside a spherical matter system Newtonian gravity and the new gravity
theory diﬀer, and it was this diﬀerence that explained the bore hole g anomaly data [5],
namely that g does not decrease down a bore hole as rapidly as Newtonian gravity predicts.
It was this anomaly that lead to the discovery that α was in fact the ﬁne structure constant,
up to experimental errors. As well the 3-space dynamics in (1) has ‘gravitational wave’
solutions [7]. Then there are regions where the velocity diﬀers slightly from the enveloping
region. In the absence of matter these waves will be in general fractal because there is no
dimensioned constant, and so no natural scale. These waves were seen by Miller, Torr and
Kolen, and by DeWitte [1, 7] as shown in Fig.2.

However an assumption made in previous analyses was that the acceleration of the 3-
space itself, in (3), was also the acceleration of matter located in that 3-space. The key
result herein is to derive this result by using the generalised Schr¨odinger equation. In doing
so we discover the additional eﬀect that vorticity in the velocity ﬁeld causes quantum states
to be rotated, as discussed in Sect.7.

3 Newtonian Gravity and the Schr¨odinger Equation

Let us consider what might be regarded as the conventional ‘Newtonian’ approach to includ-
ing gravity in the Schr¨odinger equation [8]. There gravity is described by the Newtonian
potential energy ﬁeld Φ(r, t), such that g = −∇Φ, and we have for a ‘free-falling’ quantum
system, with mass m,

= −

∇2ψ(r, t) + mΦ(r, t)ψ(r, t) ≡ H(t)Ψ,

(8)

where the hamiltonian is in general now time dependent, because the masses producing the
gravitational acceleration may be moving. Then the classical-limit trajectory is obtained
via the usual Ehrenfest method [9]: we ﬁrst compute the time rate of change of the so-called
position ‘expectation value’

In the classical limit ψ has the form of a wavepacket where the spatial extent of ψ is much
smaller than the spatial region over which g(r, t) varies appreciably. Then we have the
approximation < g(r, t) >≈ g(< r >, t), and ﬁnally we arrive at the Newtonian 2nd-law
equation of motion for the wavepacket,

d2<r>
dt2 ≈ g(< r >, t).
In this classical limit we obtain the equivalence principle, namely that the acceleration is
independent of the mass m and of the velocity of that mass. But of course that followed by
construction, as the equivalence principle is built into (8) by having m as the coeﬃcient of
Φ. In Newtonian gravity there is no explanation for the origin of Φ or g. In the new theory
gravity is explained in terms of a velocity ﬁeld, which in turn has a deeper explanation
within Process Physics.

4 Dynamical 3-Space and the Generalised Schr¨odinger

Equation

The key insight is that conventional physics has neglected the interaction of various systems
with the dynamical 3-space. Here we generalise the Schr¨odinger equation to take account of
this new physics. Now gravity is a dynamical eﬀect arising from the time-dependence and
spatial inhomogeneities of the 3-space velocity ﬁeld v(r, t), and for a ‘free-falling’ quantum
system with mass m the Schr¨odinger equation now has the generalised form

This form for H speciﬁes how the quantum system must couple to the velocity ﬁeld, and
it uniquely follows from two considerations: (i) the generalised Schr¨odinger equation must
remain form invariant under a change of observer, i.e. with t → t, and r → r + Vt, where

V is the relative velocity of the two observers. Then we compute that

that it is an invariant operator, and (ii) requiring that H(t) be
∂t
hermitian, so that the wavefunction norm is an invariant of the time evolution. This implies
that the 1
2 ∇.v term must be included, as v.∇ by itself is not hermitian for an inhomogeneous
v(r, t). Then the consequences for the motion of wavepackets are uniquely determined; they
are ﬁxed by these two quantum-theoretic requirements2.

Then again the classical-limit trajectory is obtained via the position ‘expectation value’,

ﬁrst with

is hermitian, but that separately neither of these two operators is hermitian. Then in general
the scalar product in (18) is real. But then in arriving at the last line in (18) by means of the
small-wavepacket approximation, we must then self-consistently use that ∇ × (∇ × v) = 0,
otherwise the acceleration acquires a spurious imaginary part. This is consistent with (27)
outside of any matter which contributes to the generation of the velocity ﬁeld, for there
ρ = 0. These observations point to a deep connection between quantum theory and the
velocity ﬁeld dynamics, as already argued in [1].

We see that the test ‘particle’ acquires the acceleration of the velocity ﬁeld, as in (3), and
as well an additional vorticity induced acceleration which is the analogue of the Helmholtz
acceleration in ﬂuid mechanics. Then ~ω/2 is the instantaneous angular velocity of the
local 3-space, relative to a distant observer. Hence we ﬁnd that the equivalence principle
arises from the unique generalised Schr¨odinger equation and with the additional vorticity
eﬀect. This vorticity eﬀect depends on the absolute velocity vR of the object relative to the
local space, and so requires a change in the Galilean or Newtonian form of the equivalence
principle.

The vorticity acceleration eﬀect is the origin of the Lense-Thirring so-called ‘frame-
dragging’ 4 eﬀect [10] discussed in Sect.7. While the generation of the vorticity is a rela-
tivistic eﬀect, as in (27), the response of the test particle to that vorticity is a non-relativistic
eﬀect, and follows from the generalised Schr¨odinger equation, and which is not present in
the standard Schr¨odinger equation with coupling to the Newtonian gravitational potential,
as in (8). Hence the generalised Schr¨odinger equation with the new coupling to the velocity
ﬁeld is more fundamental. The Helmholtz term in (18) is being explored by the Gravity
Probe B gyroscope precession experiment, however the vorticity caused by the motion of
the earth is extremely small, as discussed in Sect.7.

An important insight emerges from the form of (15) and (16): here the generalised
Schr¨odinger equation involves two ﬁelds v(r, t) and ψ(r, t), where the coordinate r is merely
a label to relate the two ﬁelds, and is not itself the 3-space. In particular while r may have the
form of a Euclidean 3-geometry, the space itself has time-dependence and inhomogeneities,
and as well in the more general case will exhibit vorticity ω = ∇ × v. Only in the unphysical
case does the description of the 3-space become identiﬁed with the coordinate system r, and
that is when the velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) becomes uniform and time independent. Then by a
suitable choice of observer we may put v(r, t) = 0, and the generalised Schr¨odinger equation
reduces to the usual ‘free’ Schr¨odinger equation. As we discuss later the experimental
evidence is that v(r, t) is fractal and so cannot be removed by a change to a preferred
observer. Hence the generalised Schr¨odinger equation in (15)-(16) is a major development
for fundamental physics. Of course in general other non-3-space potential energy terms may
be added to the RHS of (16). A prediction of this new quantum theory, which also extends
to a generalised Dirac equation, is that the fractal structure to space implies that even at
the scale of atoms etc there will be time-dependencies and inhomogeneities, and that these
will aﬀect transition rates of quantum systems. These eﬀects are probably those known as
the Shnoll eﬀects [11].

5 Free-Fall Minimum Proper-Time Trajectories

The acceleration in (18) also arises from the following argument, which is the analogue of
the Fermat least-time formalism. Consider the elapsed time for a comoving clock travelling
with the test particle. Then taking account of the Lamour time-dilation eﬀect that time is

4In the spacetime formalism it is mistakenly argued that it is ‘spacetime’ that is ‘dragged’.

with vR given by (19) in terms of vO and v. Then this time eﬀect relates to the speed of
the clock relative to the local 3-space, and that c is the speed of light relative to that local
3-space. We are using a relativistic treatment in (21) to demonstrate the generality of the
results5. Under a deformation of the trajectory

gravitational waves. Removing the earth induced rotation eﬀect we obtain the ﬁrst experimental

the wavepacket trajectory is speciﬁed by the least propertime geodesic.

The relativistic term in (26) is responsible for the precession of elliptical orbits and also
for the event horizon eﬀect. Hence the trajectory in (18) is a non-relativistic minimum
travel-time trajectory, which is Fermat’s Principle. The relativistic term in (26) will arise
from a generalised Dirac equation which would then include the dynamics of 3-space.

6 Fractal 3-Space and the DeWitte Experimental Data

In 1991 Roland DeWitte working within Belgacom, the Belgium telecommunications com-
pany, accidently made yet another detection of absolute motion, and one which was 1st-order
in v/c. 5MHz radio frequency (RF) signals were sent in both directions through two buried
coaxial cables linking the two clusters of cesium atomic clocks.

Changes in propagation times were observed and eventually observations over 178 days
were recorded. A sample of the data, plotted against sidereal time for just three days, is
shown in Fig.1. The DeWitte data was clear evidence of absolute motion with the Right
Ascension for minimum/maximum propagation time agreeing almost exactly with Miller’s

Figure 2: Shows the velocity ﬂuctuations, essentially ‘gravitational waves’ observed by DeWitte
in 1991 from the measurement of variations in the RF coaxial-cable one-way travel times. This
data is obtained from that in Fig.1 after removal of the dominant eﬀect caused by the rotation of
the earth. Ideally the velocity ﬂuctuations are three-dimensional, but the DeWitte experiment had
only one arm. This plot is suggestive of a fractal structure to the velocity ﬁeld. This is conﬁrmed
by the power law analysis shown in Fig.3.

direction 6 (α = 5.2hr, δ = −670)7, and with speed 420±30km/s. This local absolute motion
is diﬀerent from the CMB motion, in the direction (α = 11.20hr, δ = −7.220) with speed
of 369km/s, for that would have given the data a totally diﬀerent sidereal time signature,
namely the times for maximum/ minimum would have been shifted by 6hrs. The CMB
velocity is motion relative to the distant early universe, whereas the velocity measured in the
DeWitte and related experiments is the velocity relative to the local space. The declination
of the velocity observed in this DeWitte experiment cannot be determined from the data
as only three days of data are available. However assuming exactly the same declination as
Miller the speed observed by DeWitte appears to be also in excellent agreement with the
Miller speed. The dominant eﬀect in Fig.1 is caused by the rotation of the earth, namely
that the orientation of the coaxial cable with respect to the direction of the ﬂow past the
earth changes as the earth rotates. This eﬀect may be approximately unfolded from the
data, leaving the gravitational waves shown in Fig.2. This is the ﬁrst evidence that the
velocity ﬁeld describing 3-space has a complex structure, and is indeed fractal.

The fractal structure, i.e. that there is an intrinsic lack of scale, to these speed ﬂuc-
tuations is demonstrated by binning the absolute speeds |v| and counting the number of
6This velocity arises after removing the eﬀects of the earth’s orbital speed about the sun, 30km/s, and

the gravitational in-ﬂow past the earth towards the sun, 42km/s, as in (6).

7The opposite direction is not easily excluded due to errors within the data, and so should also be
considered as possible. A new experiment will be capable of more accurately determining the speed and
direction, as well as the fractal structure of 3-space. The author is constructung a more compact version
of the Torr-Kolen - DeWitte coaxial cable RF travel-time experiment. New experimental techniques have
been developed to increase atomic-clock based timing accuracy and stability, so that shorter cables can be
used, which will permit 3-arm devices.

Figure 3: Shows that the velocity ﬂuctuations in Fig.2 are scale free, as the probability distribution
from binning the speeds has the form p(v) ∝ |v|−2.6. This plot shows Log[p(v)] vs Log[|v|]. This
shows that the velocity ﬁeld has a fractal structure, and so requiring the generalisation of the

elsewhere).

speeds p(|v|) within each bin. A least squares ﬁt of the Log-Log plot to a straightline was
then made. Plotting Log[p(|v|)] vs Log[|v|], as shown in Fig.3, we see that the ﬁt gives
p(v) ∝ |v|−2.6. With the new experiment considerably more data will become available.

7 Observing 3-Space Vorticity

The vorticity eﬀect in (18) can be studied experimentally in the Gravity Probe B (GP-B)
gyroscope satellite experiment in which the precession of four on-board gyroscopes has been

∇ × v is generated by matter in motion through the 3-space, where here vR is the absolute
velocity of the matter relative to the local 3-space.

where L is the angular momentum of the earth, and r is the distance from the centre.

In general the vorticity term in (18) leads to an apparent ‘torque’, according to a distant

observer, acting on the angular momentum S of the gyroscope,

d3rρ(r) r × (~ω(r) × vR(r)),

~τ =

where ρ is its density, and where now vR is used here to describe the motion of the matter
forming the gyroscope relative to the local 3-space. Then dS = ~τ dt is the change in S over
the time interval dt. For a gyroscope vR(r) = s × r, where s is the angular velocity of the
gyroscope. This gives

~ω × S

and so ~ω/2 is the instantaneous angular velocity of precession of the gyroscope, which is thus
equal to the instantaneous angular velocity of 3-space, also relative to a distant observer.
The component of the vorticity in (29) has been determined from the laser-ranged satellites
LAGEOS(NASA) and LAGEOS 2(NASA-ASI) [14], and the data implies the indicated
coeﬃcient on the RHS of (27) to ±10%. For GP-B the direction of S has been chosen so
that this precession is cumulative and, on averaging over an orbit, corresponds to some
7.7 × 10−6 arcsec per orbit, or 0.042 arcsec per year. GP-B has been superbly engineered
so that measurements to a precision of 0.0005 arcsec are possible.

and then the total vorticity is ~ω = ~ωrot + ~ωtrans. The maximum magnitude of the speed
of this precession component is ωtrans/2 = gvC /c2 = 8 × 10−6arcsec/s, where here g is
the usual gravitational acceleration at the altitude of the satellite. This precession has a
diﬀerent signature: it is not cumulative, and is detectable by its variation over each single
orbit, as its orbital average is zero, to ﬁrst approximation. Fig.4 shows ∆Θ = |∆S(t)|/|S(0)|
over one orbit, where,

Here ∆S(t) is the integrated change in spin, and where the approximation arises because
the change in S(t′) on the RHS of (33) is negligible. The plot in Fig.4 shows this eﬀect to
be some 30× larger than the expected GP-B errors, and so easily detectable, if it exists as
predicted herein.

Essentially then these spin precessions are caused by the rotation of the ‘wavepackets’
describing the matter forming the gyroscopes, and caused in turn by the vorticity of 3-space.
The above analysis shows that the rotation is exactly the same as the rotation of the 3-space
itself, just as the acceleration of ‘matter’ was exactly the same as the acceleration of the
3-space. We this obtain a much clearer insight into the nature of motion, and which was
not possible in the spacetime formalism.

8 Conclusions

We have seen herein that the new theory of 3-space has resulted in a number of fundamental
developments, namely that a complex ‘quantum foam’ dynamical 3-space exists and has a
fractal ‘ﬂow’ structure, as revealed most clearly by the extraordinary DeWitte coaxial-cable
experiment. This fractal structure requires that the fundamental equations of physics be
generalised to take account of, for the ﬁrst time, the physics of this 3-space and, in particular,
here the inclusion of that dynamics within the dynamics of quantum systems. We saw
that the generalisation of the Schr¨odinger equation is unique, and that from an Ehrenfest
wavepacket analysis we obtained the equivalence principle, with the acceleration of ‘matter’
being shown to be identical to the acceleration of the 3-space; which while not unexpected,
is derived here for the ﬁrst time. This result shows that the equivalence principle is really
a quantum-theoretic eﬀect. As well we obtained by that same analysis that any vorticity
in the 3-space velocity ﬁeld will result in a corresponding rotation of wavepackets, and just
such an eﬀect is being studied in the GP-B gyroscope experiment. So for the ﬁrst time
we see that the original Schr¨odinger equation actually lacked a key dynamical ingredient.
As well because the 3-space is fractal the generalised Schr¨odinger equation now contains a
genuine element of stochasticity.

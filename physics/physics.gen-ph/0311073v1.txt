Multi - nucleon forces and the equivalence of
diﬀerent multi - cluster structures

At present it is believed that diﬀerent multi-cluster structures for light
nuclei may represent equivalent states of these nuclei. Here it is proven
that once we take account of Three Body and Four Body Forces then this
equivalence is lost.

Abstract

For quite sometime now it has been becoming clear that the best micro-
scopic calculations using successful Two Body Forces (2BF) for light nuclei
A=3,4 give underbinding and too large a radii [1]. This pointed at the re-
quirement of other forces like the Three Body Forces (3BF) and possible Four
Body Forces (4BF). The improvements arising from the inclusion of 3BF are
well known [2]. It has also been becoming clear that 4BF are essentail for a
good undertanding of light nuclei [3].

Let us accept that 3BF and 4BF are needed in a basic way for the study
of light nuclei [2,3]. It is important to note that these are genuine 3BF and
4BF which are irreducible to any 2BF etc. As nucleons have ﬁnite size and
structure it is clear that there shall be genuine multi-body forces. These will
manifest themselves in any physical situation where it would be essential to
consider overlap of multi-nucleons [4-6]. However, how and why these multi-
body forces arise is not the issue here. For our purpose here it is enough to
accept the existence of 3BF and 4BF forces. This means that to get good
description of A=3,4 nuclei we do need 3BF and 4BF in a basic way to ﬁt to
experimental quantities like binding energies, radii, charge distributions and
excitation spectra of these nuclei.

Let the Hamiltonian for upto A=4 system be

H =

+

vij +

Vijk +

A

X
i

p2
i
2m

A

X
i<j

A

X
i<j<k

A

Vijkl

X
i<j<k<l

(1)

where vij, Vijk and Vijkl are NN, NNN and NNNN potentials respectinely.
For A=2 system only the ﬁrst two terms would be present. While for A=3
system the NNN term would also be contributing. Only for A=4 system does
the 4BF term contribute.

Now let us use this Hamiltonian to solve that A=2,3,4 body problems
in nuclear physics. We may use the Quantum Monte Carlo method or some
other method to obtain the best ﬁts to all the relevant experimental quantities
of these nuclei which are: 2H, 3H and 3He and 4He. Let us assume that we
are able to do as good a job as possible. At the end of the day let the wave
functions which provided these ﬁts be ψ0(d), ψ0(t), ψ0(h) and ψ0(α). ( Note
: d= 2H, t=3H, h=3He and α=4He )

Note that all these wave functions are solutions of Hamiltonian which
have componnents not present in all of these. For example the A=4 case the
wave function has ” wounds ” inﬂicted by the 4BF which are not present

in the others. As such the wave function for A=4 case has components
which can not be reduced to any (2-body)-(2-body) or (3-body)-(1-body)
wave functions. In the same manner the A=3 case have ” wounded ” wave
functions unique to themselves and irreducible to any other system of wave
functions. These 3BF and 4BF ”wounds” in the wave functions in a way are
unique signatures of their presence in A=3 and 4 systems. Note that the
A=2 case would have none of the ”wounds” arising from 3BF or 4BF.

At present it is commonly believed that there exists equivalence of various
multi-clusters for light nuclei. For example in the oscillator model the ground
state of 6Li is described by the following wave functions of equivalent forms
[7,p.40, appendix C]

ψgs(6Li) = A{φ0(α)φ0(d)χ(α − d)} = NA(φ0(t)φ0(h)χ(t − h)}

(2)

Here χ(α − d) and χ(t − h) are two oscillator quanta wave functions
and φ0(α), φ0(d), φ0(t), φ0(h) are the internal wave functions. The constant
N is here to ensure that the two functions are equal to each other. The
mathematical equivalence of the two can be easily demonstrated. Since they
are the same, these can exist simultaneously and also note that these are
not orthogonal [7]. None of this is changed even with the hard core of the
Jastrow form in the two body interaction [7, p.113]. This is the broad view
which has been dominating the studies of light nuclei at present [7-9].

However, in the above mathematical proof, there is an underlying ansatz
- which is that in the Schroedinger equation one need not go beyond 2BF
and ignore all many body forces like the 3BF and 4BF [7, p.1]. However at
present on the basis of what we we have discussed above there is no way that
one can do without 3BF and 4BF for these nuclei. Also due to the reasons
indicated above the projection of the wave function

φ0(α)φ0(d)
on
φ0(t)φ0(h)
would be zero. Hence the putative equivalence of diﬀerent multi-clusters
[7-9] for light nuclei and which forms the backbone of studies of nuclei at
present is wrong and should be abandoned.

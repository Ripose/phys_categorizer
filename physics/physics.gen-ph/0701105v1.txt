Matrix Representation of Special Relativity

Wolfgang K¨ohler, Potsdam, Germany

February 20, 2014

Abstract

I compare the matrix representation of the basic statements of Special

Relativity with the conventional vector space representation.

It is shown, that the matrix form reproduces all equations in a very
concise and elegant form, namely: Maxwell equations, Lorentz-force,
energy-momentum tensor, Dirac-equation and Lagrangians.

The main thesis is, however, that both forms are nevertheless not
equivalent, but matrix representation is superior and gives a deeper insight
It
into physical reality, because it is based on much less assumptions.
allows a better understanding of Minkowski spacetime on the basis of
matrix algebra.

An escpecially remarkable result of the consequent usage of this alge-
braic concept is the formulation of Diracs equation in a novel matrix form.
This equation can be generalized to include a new variant of Yang-Mills
gauge ﬁelds, which possibly express uniﬁed electro-weak interactions in a
new way.

1 Introduction

The possibility to represent Minkowski spacetime vectors with 2x2-matrices is well-known since the
1920ies (e.g. [9], [7], pp. 61). It is a consequence of the fact, that the Lorentz-group is homomorphic
to the group of unimodular binary matrices SL(2, C).

This matrix representation is mostly used to show, how covariant equations for spinors can be derived.
But it is widely ignored, that on the other hand, this also can lead to another description of spacetime
itself. There also seems to exist a general consensus, that both representations (matrix form and usual
component form) are actually equivalent methods to express the equations of Special Relativity, and
consequently the matrix form is used very rarely in publications.1

One principal reason for this is surely the fact, that conventional component formulas can be formally
applied to an arbitrary number of dimensions of the vector space, while the matrix form is only possible
for the four-dimensional case.

In this article I show, that the presumed equivalence of both forms is not true. Although the equations
are isomorphic (otherwise they would be wrong), signiﬁcantly less prerequisites are needed to derive them
for the matrix form.

The most important prerequsite is the existence of a metric tensor with the signature (+ − − −), that
has to be postulated for the vector space, but it is automatically determined for the matrix formalism.
In principle, any metric signature would be conceivable for the vector space. Since the metric tensor is -
at least implicitely - contained in every relativistic equation, this statement shows, that the matrix form
is superior.

Additionally, the homogeneous Maxwell equations, which have to be introduced independently in

SRT in component form, are a direct consequence of the inhomogeneous Maxwell eqs. here.

The last and most important argument gives the reformulation of the Dirac equation in matrix
form. All arbitrary free parameters without physical content, which arise in the 4-spinor form, vanish
here, because the remaining similarity transformations can be understood as gauge transformations.

Thus I propose a change of perspective here: Theoretical physicists should consider, that the physical
spacetime primarily is a matrix algebra and the component formulation is only a derived one, which has
several disadvantages. I will denote this perspective as ”matrix spacetime” (MST) compared to ”vector
spacetime”.2

Please note also that, if this point of view is adopted, this is not only a formal aspect, but it has
far-reaching consequences for many other physical theories. E.g. General Relativity cannot be true in
its original form, since the metric tensor cannot be used as ﬁeld variable.3 Also all theories with more
than four spacetime dimensions (string theory, etc.) are obviously excluded.
This quite restrictive point of view must be seen as an advantage. One may compare this with the
principle of special relativity. It is so powerful, because it is so restrictive, namely it rules out all not
covariant eqs. The same holds for the gauge invariance principle.
As long as there is no real evidence for any extra dimensions, this description of the physical world has
at least a to be considered as possible and worth discussing.

1 One of the ﬁrst fundamental papers on this topic is [10], where the idea of em. gauge symmetry was invented and some
of the concepts and eqs. below can be found, but in a quite unusual notation for contemporary readers. Also, he focuses
there on gravitation and curved space-time and many of his presumptions were invalidated if the following years.
A newer, quite voluminuous work is [8], where the authors try to give a fundamental overview from a mathematical point
of view. They also focus on GR and various kinds of generalizations.
In neither of both works the rigorous physical interpretation is adopted, which is proposed here.

2 Compare e.g. [4], where a similar concept with a four-dimensional algebra based on the Clifford-matrices is presented.

He uses a similar term ”spacetime algebra” (STA).

3 The 4 basis matrices {τµ} introduced below, or equivalently the 16 coeﬃcients aν

µ have to be used instead. More

detailled discussions of this can be found again in [10] and [8]

This new perspective also may lead to new theories, e.g. if possible generalizations of this form are
considered. Also, one might look for an underlying spinor structure for the matrix algebra, which is
e.g. the main thesis of the “twistor-theory” presented in [8] (Vol. II) but has not led to a satisfactory
physical theory yet.

In conclusion I have to say, that many of the equations presented here, can also be found scattered in
other publications. However, their derivation and notation here is surely often more concise and straight
forward.

New in any case, is the notation of Diracs eq. as “matrix equation”. Also the corresponding
Lagrangian, I have not found in another publication. This new form perhaps allows new insights in
particle physics, esp. uniﬁed ectro-weak theory.

2 Matrix Representation of Minkowski-Vectors

Let me start with the 4-dimensional vector space of real numbers V 4 = {(x0, x1, x2, x3)}. This can be
mapped one-to-one to the set of hermitean 2x2 matrices M = {x}, when a basis of 4 linearly independent
hermitean matrices τµ = (τ0, . . . τ3) is given by (as usual, over double upper and lower indices µ = 0, . . . 3
is to sum):

x = xµτµ.

These hermitean matrices x build a well deﬁned subset of the binary matrix algebra. In the following
they are denoted as Minkowski-matrices and represented by boldface letters (except the Greek letters
ρ, τ, σ and the partial operator ∂).

Since this is a one-to-one map, it is clear that all relations written in one form can also be transcribed

into the other, and in principle no form can be given preference.
However, the crucial diﬀerence is, that one has to put a postulated metric tensor on top of the vector
space, to deﬁne a vector norm and get covariant equations there.
As shown below, for the matrix representation, the existence and form of this tensor is a natural conse-
quence of the algebraic structure.
For binary matrices holds:4

¯x = xµ ¯τµ and consequently the matrix determinant naturally deﬁnes a
bilinear norm in (xµ). This norm can now be identﬁed with the norm of the vector space. This is only
for 2x2 matrices possible, and vector dimensions greater than four are excluded.

The metric tensor g = (gµν ) is then given by:

|x| = xµxν 1
2

T (τµ ¯τν)

= xµxν gµν.

Obviously, symmetry follows gµν = gνµ and all are real numbers, as required.
On the other hand, the four matrices τµ (like every hermitean matrix) can be expressed as linear

combinations of the 3 Pauli-matrices σ1, σ2, σ3 and a fourth matrix σ0

be chosen. If the restriction of metric invariance (g = g(0)) is made, then the (aν

Lorentz-group.

Consequently for simpliﬁcation, the set of Pauli-matrices σµ is used in the following as basis. In this

⇐⇒

(5)

Because the matrix algebra includes addition and subtraction operations, also trivially the symmetry

under spacetime translations holds, i.e. it shows the complete Poincare group symmetry.

3 Transformations and Covariant Forms

A Lorentz-transformation is represented here by an unimodular 2 × 2 matrix T ∈ SL(2, C), |T | = 1 and
a Minkowski-matrix transforms with:6

x → x′ = T xT †,
(6)
which obviously preserves the hermitecity and the Minkowski-invariant |x|. It has of course 6 free real
(3 complex) parameters.7

The general scalar-product of any two Minkowski-matrices A, B is the invariant expression, which

is evidently always real:

Space rotations, as important special case, are the subgroup of matrices, obeying T † = ¯T (≡ T −1).

They additionally preserve the trace, which represents the time component x0 = 1

2 T (x).8

Another important tranfsormation, which cannot be represented with any matrix T of this group, is

spatial inversion P. It is obviously described by9

T (A ¯B) = AµBµ.

x → xsp = ¯x.

(8)

It is remarkable, that P is closely connected to the matrix multiplication order, since a general
covariant equation of the form A ¯B = C (A, B beeing two arbitrary MMs)10 transforms to ¯BA = ¯Csp.

the kernel T ∈ {I, −I} (see e.g. [8], pp. 16).

8 Since T is then is a similarity transformation, T xT −1, it is also clear that both eigenvalues of x are invariant.

4 Relativistic Electromagnetics

4.1 Maxwell-Equations

In conventional component notation one starts with the antisymmetric ﬁeld tensor Fµν = −Fνµ, which
is composed from electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors ~E, ~B:

Then the 4 inhomogeneous Maxwell-eqs. are (with Jµ as 4-vector of current, see e.g. [1], p. 42)

F01 = E1, . . .

and F12 = B3, . . . , .

Additionally, the 4 homogeneous eqs. must be postulated:11

∂Fµν
∂xν

= Jµ.

∂Fµν
∂xσ

+

∂Fνσ
∂xµ

+

∂Fσν
∂xν

= 0.

In the matrix form there is only one matrix equation, which includes either homog. and inhomog.
eqs.:12

∂F = J.
(9)
Proof: Here F is a traceless matrix (F + ¯F = 0), which combines the ﬁeld vectors, here as traceless,
hermitean matrices E = Ekσk, (k = 1, . . . , 3) and B = Bkσk:

F = E + iB.

The partial derivation operator ∂ is according the above a hermitean (Minkowski-) matrix with the
explicit form

∂ = σµ

∂
∂xµ

=

∂x0

Then the l.h.s. of eq. (9) can be decomposed into an hermitean and anti-hermitean term (vanishing,
since J is hermitean), which are both Maxwell eqs.

∂F = (

+ ∇)(E + iB) = ˙E + ∇ · E + i∇ × B

The Lorentz-covariance of (9) is guaranteed, when the following transformation rule for F is assumed13

(10)

(11)

(12)

F → F ′ = ¯T †F T †.

For checking the mirror-invariance of (9) one must realize, that E, B transform as proper- and pseudo-
vectors, resp. under spatial inversion: Esp = ¯E = −E and Bsp = − ¯B = +B. Thus Fsp = −F † = ¯F †
holds and consequently (9) is mirror-invariant.14

11 In some textbooks these eqs. are considered as consequence of the potential ansatz for F : Fµν =

. But this
ansatz would not be possible, if the homog. eqs. would not be fulﬁlled. So, in any case, two independent eqs. are needed
to describe the em-ﬁeld. The potential ansatz in matrix form reads F = 1

12 This matrix eq. actually consists of 4 complex, i.e. 8 real eqs.
13 Like necessary, for space rotations ¯T = T † then E, B transform independently as 3-vectors, but for proper LT, they

get mixed.

14 From ∂spFsp = Jsp → ¯∂ ¯F † = ¯J, and after bar-operation and herm. conj. one gets the original eq. again, q.e.d.

4.2 Lorentz-Force
In conventional component form the Lorentz-force is Kµ = Fµν J ν. Here one has the matrix form,
which obviously gives a hermitean force matrix K:

K =

(JF + F †J).

(13)

Of course, it is Lorentz-covariant and mirror-invariant.

4.3 Energy-Momentum-Tensor of Electromagnetic Field

Although it is not strictly necessary for the main thesis of this paper, I included this chapter, because it
shows quite impressively the power of the matrix formalism.15

Inserting the Maxwell eq. (9) into the Lorentz-force (13) immediately gives:16

K =

((F †∂)F + F †(∂F )) =

This derivation, consisting only of two simple reorderings,
is signiﬁcantly more stringent than the
corresponding component form ([1], p. 50). Obviously the four hermitean matrices Tµ (with 16 real
components) here represent the energy-momentum tensor.

To get the corresponding component form, one uses the general mapping formula (5), which here

leads to the 16 real components: T ν
Then with the following explicit formula the symmetry of Tµν = Tνµ can be easily shown, with usual
formulas for the trace:

2 T (Tµσν ).17

µ = 1

Tµν =

T (Tµ ¯σν ) =

5 Relativistic Quantum Mechanics

In this section I will show, that relativistic quantum mechanics can be readily expressed with 2 × 2
matrices (which is well-known for a great part), but useless degrees of freedom are signiﬁcantly supressed.

This is an especially important case, since in our contemporary understanding, quantum mechanics
and esp. Diracs eq. (with its various generalizations) is the fundament of the physical world. On the
other hand, this theory is surely not yet ﬁnished, and it is to expect that new insights will evolve in the
future, possibly within the framework of the matrix formalism.

Here closes the circle: the matrix formulation was ﬁrst introduced for the description of quantum

mechanical spin and can now hopefully lead to a better understanding of physics.

15 Of course, a general tensor with 16 real components, or a symmetric tensor with 10, cannot be represented by a single

2x2-matrix, but only by a set of matrices.

16 the parentheses in the ﬁrst terms denote the diﬀerential-operands of ∂, while in the underlined term it operates both

5.1 Dirac-Equation
In most modern textbooks Diracs eq.
the four Clifford matrices γµ (and ∂µ def
(ψ1, . . . , ψ4)T : (see [3], p. 50, [7] pp. 110)

is presented in the conventional component notation, with
= ∂
) for the 4-spinor wave function as column vector ψ =
∂xµ

iγµ∂µψ = mψ.

(16)

This is a mathematically very elegant form, but it is achieved at the price of loss of physical reality of
ψ. It exposes a great amount of ambiguity, since it is obviuously invariant under the so called similarity
transformations18 (see e.g. [3], p. 55):

γµ → U γµU −1

and ψ → U ψ.

Here U is an arbitrary 4 × 4 matrix, containing 16 free complex parameters. This means, the formula
(16) allows a linear transformation, leading to diﬀerent representations, with 16 complex parameters
without any change of the physical meaning. The components of ψ thus cannot represent any physical
entities directly. In my opinion, this is a great disadvantage of this formula.

For the derivation of the matrix form, I start with the Weyl-representation of the γµ

γ0 =

0, −I2
,
−I2, 0(cid:19)

(cid:18)

and γk =

0, σk
,
−σk, 0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

k = 1, 2, 3.

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

This form has the important special feature, that here the 4-spinor can be decomposed into two 2-spinors
, which transform independently under Lorentz-transformations (see below), and (16)
Ψ, Φ: ψ =
reads with them:
(cid:1)

Ψ
Φ

(cid:0)

i∂Φ = −mΨ and i ¯∂Ψ = −mΦ.

An additional, external electromagnetic vector potential ﬁeld A is as usual introduced by the substitution
∂ → ∂ − ieA:

(i∂ + eA)Φ = −mΨ and (i ¯∂ + e ¯A)Ψ = −mΦ.

This bi-spinor form of Diracs eq.
is well-known (although in most cases given in slightly diﬀerent
notation, see e.g. [7], p. 70) and sometimes referred to as ”zigzag” model of the electron (e.g. [8]). From
(19) the Lorentz-transformation rules for the 2-spinors can be derived as:19

Ψ → T Ψ and Φ → ¯T †Φ,

leading to obviously covariant eqs. (19). Under spatial inversions both eqs. and consequently the spinors
are interchanging: Ψ ↔ Φ.

It is not yet commonly known, however, that both parts of (19) can be combined in one single matrix
equation. This representation must be considered as the natural form of Diracs eq. in the MST context,
and it opens up new possibilities for its generalization.

To develop this matrix eq., the second equation of (19) is converted in the following manner. With

M = i∂ + eA it reads ¯M Ψ = −mΦ.

18 They are not connected to a Lorentz-transformation, since the spacetime components are not aﬀected at all.
19 consider again that ∂ and A transform like ∂ → T ∂T †

Matrix Representation of Special Relativity

Now, one uses the general formula for every 2x2 matrix M (M T denoting transposed matrix):20

¯M = ρM T ¯ρ, with ρ

def
=

0, 1
−1, 0(cid:19)

(cid:18)

and inserting this leads to M T ρΨ = −mρΦ.

Of this one takes the complex conjugate, using (M T )∗ = M † = −i∂ + eA:

(−i∂ + eA)ρΨ∗ = −mρΦ∗.

Here it is obviuously useful to deﬁne a new ”tilde-operator”21 for 2-spinors:
then writes (−i∂ + eA)
Then it is possible to combine this equation and the ﬁrst of (19) as 2 columns into one 2x2 matrix
equation:

Ψ = −m

ﬁnally gets:

(cid:0)
(cid:1)
eAP + ∂P S = m ¯P †.

(21)

Although this formula at a ﬁrst glance looks somewhat uncommon, esp. the right-side factor S in the
derivation term, it possesses all features and solutions of the original 4-spinor equation (16).
The 2x2-matrix S together with the operator on the r.h.s here ”magically absorb” all 4 Clifford
matrices γµ. It should be clear from the above, that the special form of S (S = iσ3), is the consequence
of the choice of γµ. A more general form shall be discussed below.

To demonstrate the power of this matrix eq., one can derive an equivalent bilinear form by multipli-
cating it from left22 with P †, resulting in eP †AP + P †(∂P )S = m|P |∗. Note, that this is still a matrix
eq., although the r.h.s. is scalar (∼ I), and equivalent to (21), provided P is not singular (|P | 6= 0).
This direct way is only possible by using matrix algebra. By utilizing this bilinear form, esp. many
computations, e.g. regarding gauge invariance, Lagrangian and conservations laws can be performed
much simpler.

According to above deﬁnitions, P transforms consistently with P → ¯T †P under Lorentz-
transformations and (21) is obviously covariant. Since ¯T † operates only from the left on P , the two
column 2-spinors of P transform equally and independently.
The mirror-invariance is guaranteed with P → Psp = ¯P † (since S = ¯S†).

Here also a similarity transformation is possible by right-side multiplication23 of P with a matrix U

obeying U = ¯U †

P → P U and S → U −1SU,

(22)

but this 2x2-matrix U has only 2 free complex parameters (4 real), compared to 16 above (since one of
the 4 real parameters is only a constant factor, there actually remain only 3 real free parameters).

20 A geometric explanation is, that the bar-operation as mentioned already, means spatial inversion, which is equal to the
combined operation of transposing (i.e. y → −y) and a rotation around y of 180?, which is performed by the transformation
T = ρ = iσ2.

21 this operator obeys
Ψ = −Ψ, since ρ2 = −1
22 multiplication from right produces another eq. with the same r.h.s.
23 left-side multiplication always describes a Lorentz-transformation

Essentially this transformation says, that S (like U ) can be any matrix obeying the condition S = ¯S†,
which describes a subalgebra of matrices, which is isomorphic to the algebra of quaternions.

An obvious possibility to explain the remaining ambiguity physically, is discussed in chapter 5.3.

The gauge invariance of (21) and the corresponding Lagrangian (24) below is a bit diﬀerent to
the conventional form, because P cannot be multiplied with a scalar complex phase factor eiλ, because
the mass-term would then transform with e−iλ. Also the usual covariant replacement of the derivation
operator ∂µ → Dµ = ∂µ − ieAµ cannot simply be transcribed to D = ∂ − iA, but must be modiﬁed here.
However, one easily checks, that the gauge transformation24

P → P eλS

and eA → eA + ∂λ,

(23)

where λ(x) is an arbitrary real spacetime function, is the correct form.

Another major advantage of the form (21) of Diracs eq should be shortly sketched at the end. Also
weak interactions in the V-A-theory are most simply expressed in this form. This is seen as another hint,
that this form is the primary one. It follows from the fact, that for the used Weyl-representation the
matrix γ5
. And since weak interaction couples in the
(cid:1)
4-spinor form with I4 ± γ5, so always in one of the eq-pair (19) the respective term vanishes.
Further considerations, regarding electro-weak gauge theory are done in chapter 5.3.

5.2 Lagrangian of Coupled Dirac- and EM-Field
Lagrangians play a very important role in modern ﬁeld theory. They can readily be written in matrix
form using the above entities. For the combined Dirac- and em-ﬁeld it is the sum of four scalar terms:

L = T (P †(∂P )S) + eT (AP P †) − 2ℜ|F | − 2mℜ|P |.

(24)

This form demonstrates another advantage of the matrix representation. It can reveal subtle similarities
between some terms (here e.g. the 3. and 4. term), which are hidden in the component form.
The validity of (24) can be proved by transforming it into component form, or better by deriving the
ﬁeld eqs., namely (9) and (21) from it. This complete derivation must be omitted here, only some basic
steps should be stated.

In the ﬁrst (diﬀerential) term, the partial operator should only operate to the right (as indicated by the
parentheses). Furthermore one notices, that this term is not real (as normally required for a Lagrangian
and is the case for the other three terms). However, the actually relevant spacetime integral is real:

I =

d4x T (P †(∂P )S) = real,

i.e. ℑ(I) = 0,

Z

which is proved with the vanishing of the integral
and partial integration.

T ((P †∂P )S) =

∂µT (P †σµP S) = 0 by Gauss’ law

The third term is the well-known Lagrangian of the electromagnetic ﬁeld Lem = −2ℜ|F | = E2 −B2,

since F = 1

2 ( ¯∂A − ¯A∂) = E + iB.

Consequently, the variation of A in the second and third term, leads to Maxwells eq. (9), if the

4-current of the Dirac-ﬁeld is deﬁned as

(= e ¯P † ¯P ).

Variation of P † (or independently P ) in the terms 1, 2 and 4 leads to Diracs-eq. (21).

5.3 Yang-Mills Gauge-Fields in Matrix Form
The remaining possibility of similarity transformations P → P U ( ¯U = U †, see chapter 5.1) leads to an
obvious generalization of the Dirac eq. in matrix form (21) with four vector ﬁelds Aµ, µ = 0, . . . , 3:

∂P S + AµP σµ = m ¯P †.

(26)

This also resolves the remaining ambiguities of P . Here A0 ≡ A is apparently again the em. vector
potential, which is invariant under this transformation. The other three ﬁelds (A1, A2, A3) mix however
(under Lorentz-trafos they act as normal MMs, like A), since with U σkU −1 = am
k σm, (m, k = 1, 2, 3)
mAm. With the additional restriction |U | = 1 this is the SU (2) group and its SO(3)
follows Ak → ak
representation acts on the Ak.

One can now formulate the fascinating hypothesis, that by introducing a local non-abelian gauge ﬁeld

U (x) the uniﬁed electro-weak ﬁeld may be represented, similar to Yang-Mills theory (see e.g. [2]).

It is striking, that this gauge ﬁeld shows remarkable similarities to the symmetry SU (2) × U (1) as

proposed by Weinberg and Salam for the uniﬁed theory, although it is evidently not equivalent.25
To get all 4 gauge ﬁelds, it is obviously necessary to use the inﬁnitesimal generator of the complete
quaternionic algebra26 for U instead of the subset SU (2), which is:

U (x) = eλ0σ0+iλkσk ≈ I + λ0σ0 + iλkσk, k = 1, 2, 3,

with 4 real spacetime functions λµ(x), (|λµ| ≪ 1).
Then λ3(x) represents the em. gauge ﬁeld, coupled with A ≡ A0 (if S = iσ3, as before (23) explained).
The other three gauge ﬁelds, however, lead to anti-hermitean vector ﬁelds (Ak)† = −Ak, because i∂λk
is anti-hermitean.
The gauge ﬁelds λ1,2(x) couple with ±A2,1, respectively. The gauge ﬁeld λ0(x) obviously represents a
boost (since |U | 6= 1) and couples with A3, very diﬀerent to the standard theory.

In conclusion should be emphasized the remarkable fact, that the gauge symmetry here is an intrinsic
feature of Diracs eq.
in matrix form and its group structure is automatically determined. Moreover,
gauge- and Lorentz-symmetry here turn out to be “two sides of one coin” in the general transformation
formula for the spinor-matrix P → T P U .

Further discussions, regarding covariant ﬁeld equations for the associated generalized em. ﬁeld tensors
F µ, the complete Lagrangian and a possible Higgs mechanism for symmetry breaking, go beyond the
scope of this article and shall be considered in a subsequent paper.

5.4 2-Spinors and Minkowski-Matrices

At the end, some general remarks about the relations of spinors and matrices should be added. As stated
, . . ., which transform under
above, 2-spinors are represented by binary column matrices Ψ =
LT as Ψ → T Ψ. Then for a any pair of spinors P = (Ψ, Φ) the determinant |P | = |Ψ, Φ| = αδ − βγ is
(cid:1)
obviously a Lorentz-invariant, because T P = (T Ψ, T Φ).

, Φ =

Also note the important fact, that spinor products, like e.g. the matrix:27

H = ΨΨ† =

(α∗, β∗) =

25 Here U (1) for electromagnetic gauge is a subgroup of SU (2).
26 See again chapter 5.1; the only required condition for U is actually ¯U = U †, which is fulﬁlled by this algebra.

Remember, that σ0 = I, so one gets ¯U = U † = eλ

−iλkσk

27 In most textbooks a “dotted index” notation is used to describe conjugated spinors like Ψ†, that goes back to the ﬁrst

publications on this topic. I do not adopt it here.

is obviously a Minkowski-matrix (in this special example a null-matrix:
|H| = 0). That says, that
matrices can be constructed by spinors, but the opposite does not hold. Only null-matrices can be
uniquely (up to a phase-factor) decomposed into spinors.

It is also a fascinating feature of forms like (27), that they have a positive deﬁnite time-component,
which might help to explain the direction of time. From the realization, that 2-spinors are the algebraic
basis of all, it will be possibly feasible to develop a complete theory of spacetime only with spinors.

The crucial problem is however, how to retain the spacetime translation symmetry in such constructs.

6 Conclusions

In this paper I have presented the most important concepts of Special Relativity in 2x2-matrix
form, namely the entities and equations of electromagnetic interactions and the Dirac equation. Es-
sentially this form uses another algebraic concept of spacetime, rather than the conventional vector space.

Although the equations are obviously identical to conventional component formulation, I have showed
that the matrix form has several striking advantages, which suggest that this form should be considered
as the primary description of the physical world.

The main advantages can be shortly summarized:

• The metric tensor needs not to be postulated and spacetime can have no

more than four dimensions

• The Maxwell equations are represented by a single equation rather than

two independent

physical meaning

of Diracs eq.
interactions

• The Dirac spinor ﬁeld has much less of degrees of freedom without any

• A new type of Yang-Mills gauge ﬁelds arises from the generalization
in matrix form, which possibly can describe electro-weak

From a heuristic point of view, from a bunch of theories which describe the same phenomena with

equal accuracy, the one with the least prerequisites should be given preference.

Another major intention of writing this paper was, to encourage other theoretical physicists, to ﬁnd
extensions of this concept for new theories. Also I hope to be able, to present a new concept for quantum
mechanics on the basis of this algebra, which can replace the wave function by discrete entities.

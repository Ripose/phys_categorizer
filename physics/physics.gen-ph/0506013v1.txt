Abstract

The terms in the quantum scattering in scalar ﬁeld theory models is parameterized
by the invariants Q snij
ij . The sij are kinematic two-particle invariants, and the nij are
integers. The coeﬃcients of these terms are computed via integrating all Feynman
diagrams, or within the derivative expansion by solving the iteration equations. The
latter has been provided recently; the functions which are prefactors of the individual
terms Q snij
ij can be interpreted as terms in the expansions of L-series, which may be
speciﬁed by collections of their zeroes. Once ﬁnding the appropriate elliptic curve
coeﬃcients, these quantum ﬁeld solutions provide an algorithm to determining all
of the mod p zeros to the algebraic curves. The latter is presumably determined
by ’experimental’ computer modeling or by the appropriate determination of the
quantum prefactors.

The quantum solution to scalar ﬁeld models is determined by the initial condi-
tions of the bare Lagrangian. Given the initial conditions, there is an algorithm for
determining the quantum scattering. These initial conditions are examined, together
with solving all of the integrals, for φ3 theory in [1]. The solutions to the terms in
the eﬀective action, or scattering, is developed in prior works.

The bare Lagrangian is contained in the expansion,

with the higher order terms

The operators Oi may contain terms such as φ2 φ2 and all combinations of deriva-
tives with the ﬁelds φ. The initial theory in (1) and (2).

The solution to these scalar models requires the summation of terms, i.e. rainbow
graphs, illustrated in [1]. These graphs were integrated in [1], and the integration leads
to a simpliﬁcation of the arbitrary loop graphs in the conventional Feynman diagrams.
The summation appears complicated due to the combinatorics of the tree diagrams
obtained from the theory in (1) and (2); however, there are simpliﬁcations that allow
the summation to be performed [2] in the arbitrary bare Lagrangian described.

The scattering at n-point in these scalar models is described by functions in

k-space,

Asij = fsij ,nij Y snij

ij

,

with the invariants sij = (ki+kj) and with the nij integers labeling the expansion. The
set of all combinations spans the complete scattering at an arbitrary n-point (with n
labeling the ki in the product). The functions f are functions of the couplings λ3, λ4,
as well as the coeﬃcients of the higher derivative terms in the bare theory as spanned
by the operators Oi.

The determination of the functions fsij,nij are given in [1]. It is remarkable that
a closed form solution can almost be given, in [1], for an arbitrary bare Lagrangian.
(As mentioned, the summations in [1] can also be obtained, most likely, in [2].)

The determination of the functions fsij ,nij could require a diﬀerent determination,
for example requiring the period matrix as in the case of the N = 2 superpotential
(or prepotential). However, in the scalar ﬁeld models there are an inﬁnite number of
functions spanned by the non-two derivative terms.

These functions are a power series in the coupling λ3, and in the other couplings.
If all of the couplings are chosen to be proportional to λ3, with factors of the mass m
(or in a conventional cutoﬀ setting involving Λ), then these functions are arbitrary.
This would involve power series possibly multiplying the bare terms. However, the
theory involving only the λ3 term is suﬃcient for this analysis.

The series of functions fsij ,nij span a set of determined functions, all of which in
in φ3, φ4, or with the

perturbation theory are power series in the coupling λ (i.e.
improvements).

These functions can be turned into a collection of zeros. For example, these

functions, as

can be converted into the zero set,

fi = X ai,jλj

fi = Y(˜λi,a + λa)

with the factors ˜λi,a complex variables. The i labels the various terms in the quan-
tum scattering at n-point. These functions can be interpreted as the zero set to an
associated L-series

L(C, λ) = Y(1 − app−2λ + p1−2λ)−1 .

These L-series have an arbitary set of zeros on the complex plane, given the parameters
ap = Np + p which might be arbitrary; however, the curve and its solutions

with p prime generate these solutions; Np counts the solutions at a given prime p.
The numbers a and b which determine these solutions could be large or small. These

y2 = x3 + ax + b mod p

L-series have an expansion, in λ which is a power series; they also are described by the
zero set of the function as in (5) (the simplest example is the Riemann zeta function).

The interpretation of the quantum scattering, as described in the scalar ﬁeld
theory [1] and in [2], in terms of the elliptic function is valuable for a number of
reasons. Primarily, once the curves’ numbers ai and bi are determined, then all of the
solutions’ countings ap in (6) can be found by an inverse transform; the solution to
the ai and bi curve parameters depends on the n-point number and the set of integers
nij (deﬁning Q snij
ij ). Given the parameters ai and bi, this solution can be obtained,
of which there no known recipe is known.

The terms in the eﬀective action has been explained for an arbitrary tree solution
in [1] and [2]. Apart from a solution based on the integrated terms as generated in
a general setting [1], the symmetries of these tree diagrams is important to ﬁnd the
parameters ai and bi for the general term Q snij
ij .

The parameters ai and bi require a diﬀerent determination of the functions fi from
the explicit integral solution based on the derivative expansion. Once these terms are
described, for a potential arbitrary set of conditions in the bare theory, which would
generate an arbitrary curve (with ai and bi), then any elliptic curve could be modeled.
This elliptic curve modeling would generate all of the solution numbers ap in (6).

This work has bearing on the base interpetration of the elliptic modeling in [3],
the gauge and gravity quantum solution (with [4]), and the compact expressions for
gauge amplitudes in [5].

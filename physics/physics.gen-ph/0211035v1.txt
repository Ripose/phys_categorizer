Abstract

Gravitomagnetic and gravitoelectric forces have been studied for
sometime and tests for detecting such forces arising from the earth, are
under way. We apply similar considerations at the level of elementary
particles in a formulation using General Relativity, and deduce the
presence of short range forces. A possible candidate could be the
somewhat recently detected but otherwise mysterious short range B
force, mediated by massive ”photons”.

1 Introduction

In some ways the General Relativistic gravitational ﬁeld resembles the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld, particularly in certain approximations, as for example
when the ﬁeld is stationary or nearly so and the velocities are small. In this
case the equations of General Relativity can be put into a form resembling
those of Maxwell’s Theory, and then the ﬁelds have been called Gravitoelec-
tric and Gravitomagnetic [1, 2]. Experiments have also been suggested for
measuring the Gravitomagnetic force components for the earth [3].
We can ask whether such a consideration can be applied to elementary parti-
cles, if in fact they can be considered in the context of General Relativity. It
may be mentioned that apart from Quantum Gravity, there have been three
diﬀerent approaches for studying elementary particles via General Relativ-
ity [4, 5, 6] and references therein. We will now show that it is possible to
extend the Gravitomagnetic and Gravitoelectric formulations to elementary
particles within the framework of the theory developed in [6].

2 The Elementary Particle Case

In [6], the linearized General Relativistic equations are seen to describe the
properties of elementary particles, such as spin, mass, charge and even the
very Quantum Mechanical anomalous gyromagnetic ratio g = 2, apart from
several other characteristics [7, 8, 9, 10]. There are several nuances and
Compton scale phenomena like fuzzy spacetime come in, but these do not
concern us here, and can be found in the references.
We merely report that the linearized equations [2, 11] of General Relativity,
viz.,

gµν = ηµν + hµν, hµν =

4Tµν(t − |~x − ~x′|, ~x′)
|~x − ~x′|

d3x′

Z

where as usual,

T µν = ρuuuv

lead to the mass, spin, gravitational potential and charge of an electron,
if we work at the Compton scale (Cf.ref.[6] for details). Let us now apply
the macro Gravitoelectic and Gravitomagnetic equations to the above case.
Infact these equations are (Cf.ref.[1]).

∇ · ~Eg ≈ −4πρ, ∇ × ~Eg ≈ −∂ ~Hg/∂t, etc.

~Eg = −∇φ − ∂ ~A/∂t,

φ ≈ −

(g00 + 1), ~Aı ≈ g0ı,

~Hg = ∇ × ~A

The subscripts g in the equations (3), (4), (5) are to indicate that the ﬁelds
E and H in the macro case do not really represent the Electromagnetic ﬁeld,
but rather resemble them. Let us apply equation (4) to equation (1), keeping
in mind equation (5). We then get, considering only the order of magnitude,
which is what interests us here, after some manipulation

In (6) and (7) the distance r is much greater than a typical Compton wave-
length, to make the approximations considered in deriving the Gravitomag-
netic and Gravitoelectric equations meaningful.
Remembering that we have

mV r ≈ h,

the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in (6) and (7) now become

We now observe that (8) does not really contain the mass of the elementary
particle. Could we get a further insight into this new force?
Indeed in the above linearized General Relativistic characterisation of the
it turns out that the electron can be represented by the Kerr-
electron,
Newman metric (Cf.[6] for details). This incidentally also gives the anoma-
lous gyromatgnetic ratio g = 2. This result has recently been reconﬁrmed
by Nottale [12] from a totally diﬀerent point of view, using scaled relativity.
It is well known that the Kerr-Newman ﬁeld has extra electric and magnetic
terms (Cf.[13]), both of the order 1
It may be asked if there is any candidate as yet for the above short range
force. There is already one such candidate - the inexplicable B(3) [14] force
mediated by massive photons and of short range, ﬁrst detected in 1992 at
Cornell and since conﬁrmed by subsequent experiments. (It diﬀers from the
usual B(1) and B(2) ﬁelds of special relativity, mediated as they are, by mass-
less photons.)
A Final Comment: It is quite remarkable that equations like (3), (4) and (5)
which resemble the equations of electromagnetism, have in the usual macro
considerations no connection whatsoever with electromagnetism except in
appearance. This would seem to be a rather miraculous coincidence. In fact
the above considerations of the linearized General Relativistic theory of the
electron as also the Kerr-Newman metric formulation, demonstrate that the
resemblence to electromagnetism is not an accident, because in this latter
formulation, both electromagnetism and gravitation arise from the metric
(Cf.also refs.[15, 6, 7, 8]).

Abstract

The Planck scale is considered to be a natural minimum scale,
made up as it is solely of fundamental constants. However the Planck
scale is well beyond the scales encountered in real life, these latter
being at least of the order of the Compton scale. The Compton scale
too is fundamental in the same sense – it is made up of fundamental
micro physical constants, though it is 1020 orders higher than the
Planck scale. We discuss here a mechanism by which the Planck scale
manifests itself at the real life Compton scale, this happening due to
processes within the Planck time. Related issues are also discussed.

1 Introduction

Max Planck had noticed that, what we call the Planck scale today,

1

is made up of the fundamental constants of nature and so, he suspected it
played the role of a fundamental length. Indeed, modern Quantum Gravity
approaches have invoked (1) in their quest for a reconciliation of gravitation
with other fundamental interactions. In the process, the time honoured pre-
scription of a diﬀerentiable spacetime has to be abandoned.
There is also another scale, made up of fundamental constants of nature,
viz., the well known Compton scale,

(1)

(2)

l = e2/mec2

where e is the electron charge and me the electron mass.
The scale (2) has also played an important role in modern physics, though
it is not considered as fundamental as the Planck scale. Nevertheless, the
Compton scale (2) is close to reality in the sense of experiment, unlike (1),
which is well beyond foreseeable experimental contact.
What we need to seek is a physical rationale for a route from (1) to (2).

2 The Planck and Compton Scales

We ﬁrst give a rationale for the fact that the Planck scale would be a min-
imum scale in the universe. Our starting point [1] is the model for the
underpinning at the Planck scale for the universe. This is a collection of N
Planck scale oscillators (Cf.refs.[2, 3, 4, 5, 6] for details). We do not need to
specﬁfy N. We have in this case the following well known relations

R = √N l, Kl2 = kT,

=

(3)

kT
ml2

ω2
max =

K
m
In (3), R is of the order of the diameter of the universe, K is the analogue
of the spring constant, T is the eﬀective temperature while l is the analogue
of the Planck length, m the analogue of the Planck mass and ωmax is the
frequency–the reason for the subscript max will be seen below. We do not
yet give l and m their usual values as given in (1) for example, but rather
try to deduce these values.
We now use the well known result that the individual minimal oscillators are
black holes or mini universes as shown by Rosen [7]. So using the well known
Beckenstein temperature formula for these primordial black holes [8], that is

in (3) we get,

10−5gms.

which is another form of (1). We can easily verify that (4) leads to the value
m
In deducing (4) we have used the typical expressions for
the frequency as the inverse of the time - the Compton time in this case
and similarly the expression for the Compton length. However it must be

(4)

kT =

reiterated that no speciﬁc values for l or m were considered in the deduction
of (4).
We now make two interesting comments. Cercignani and co-workers have
shown [9, 10] that when the gravitational energy becomes of the order of the
electromagnetic energy in the case of the Zero Point oscillators, that is

then this deﬁnes a threshold frequency ωmax above in which the oscillations
become chaotic.
Secondly from the parallel but unrelated theory of phonons [11, 12], which
are also bosonic oscillators, we deduce a maximal frequency given by

In (6) c is, in the particular case of phonons, the velocity of propagation,
that is the velocity of sound, whereas in our case this velocity is that of light.
Frequencies greater than ωmax in (6) are meaningless. We can easily verify
that (5) and (6) give back (4).
Finally we can see from (3) that, given the value of lP and using the value
of the radius of the universe, viz., R

1027, we can deduce that,

In a sense the relation (4) can be interpreted in a slightly diﬀerent vein as
representing the scale at which all energy- gravitational and electromagnetic
becomes one.
The Compton scale comes as a Quantum Mechanical eﬀect, within which we
have zitterbewegung eﬀects and a breakdown of Causal Physics [13]. Indeed
Dirac had noted this aspect in connection with two diﬃculties with his elec-
tron equation. Firstly the speed of the electron turns out to be the velocity
of light. Secondly the position coordinates become complex or non Hermi-
tian. His explanation was that in Quantum Theory we cannot go down to
arbitrarily small spacetime intervals, for the Heisenberg Uncertainty Princi-
ple would then imply arbitrarily large momenta and energies. So Quantum
Mechanical measurements are an average over intervals of the order of the
Compton scale. Once this is done, we recover meaningful physics. All this
has been studied afresh by the author more recently, in the context of a non

3

diﬀerentiable spacetime and noncommutative geometry.
Weinberg also notices the non physical aspect of the Compton scale [14].
Starting with the usual light cone of Special Relativity and the inversion of
the time order of events, he goes on to add, and we quote at a little length
and comment upon it, “Although the relativity of temporal order raises no
problems for classical physics, it plays a profound role in quantum theories.
The uncertainty principle tells us that when we specify that a particle is at
position x1 at time t1, we cannot also deﬁne its velocity precisely. In conse-
quence there is a certain chance of a particle getting from x1 to x2 even if
x1
. To be more precise, the

probability of a particle reaching x2 if it starts at x1 is nonnegligible as long
as

10−25sec. Recall that in our units 1sec = 3

where ¯h is Planck’s constant (divided by 2π) and m is the particle mass.
(Such space-time intervals are very small even for elementary particle masses;
10−14cm or in time
for instance, if m is the mass of a proton then ¯h/m = 2
×
1010cm.) We are thus
units 6
faced again with our paradox; if one observer sees a particle emitted at x1,
2)2 is positive (but less than

and absorbed at x2, and if (x1
1
2
/m2), then a second observer may see the particle absorbed at x2 at
or = ¯h
a time t2 before the time t1 it is emitted at x1.
“There is only one known way out of this paradox. The second observer
must see a particle emitted at x2 and absorbed at x1. But in general the
particle seen by the second observer will then necessarily be diﬀerent from
that seen by the ﬁrst. For instance, if the ﬁrst observer sees a proton turn
into a neutron and a positive pi-meson at x1 and then sees the pi-meson and
some other neutron turn into a proton at x2, then the second observer must
see the neutron at x2 turn into a proton and a particle of negative charge,
which is then absorbed by a proton at x1 that turns into a neutron. Since
mass is a Lorentz invariant, the mass of the negative particle seen by the
second observer will be equal to that of the positive pi-meson seen by the
ﬁrst observer. There is such a particle, called a negative pi-meson, and it
does indeed have the same mass as the positive pi-meson. This reasoning
leads us to the conclusion that for every type of charged particle there is an
oppositely charged particle of equal mass, called its antiparticle. Note that
this conclousion does not obtain in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics or in
relativistic classical mechanics; it is only in relativistic quantum mechanics

4

that antiparticles are a necessity. And it is the existence of antiparticles that
leads to the characteristic feature of relativistic quantum dynamics, that
given enough energy we can create arbitrary numbers of particles and their
antiparticles.”
We note however that there is a nuance here which distinguishes Weinberg’s
explanation from that of Dirac.
In Weinberg’s analysis, one observer sees
only protons at x1 and x2, whereas the other observer sees only neutrons at
x1 and x2 while in between, the ﬁrst observer sees a positively charged pion
and the second observer a negatively charged pion. We will come back to
this point later but remark that Weinberg’s explanation is in the spirit of the
Feynman-Stuckleberg diagrams.

3 The Transition

We now address the question of the mechanism by which there is a transition
from the Planck scale to the Compton scale. For this we will need a relation
that is well known in the literature [15, 16]

G = Θ/t

(8)

It may be mentioned that this relation (8) shows the gravitational constant
as varying with time. This dependence also features in the Dirac Cosmology
[17].
We now observe the following: It is known that for a Planck mass mP ∼
10−5gm, all the energy is gravitational and in fact we have, as in (4),
Gm2

P ∼
For such a mass the Schwarzschild radius is the Planck length or Compton
length for a Planck mass

e2

GmP
c2 = lP ∼

¯h/mP c

∼

−33cm

10

We can compare (9) with (2) which deﬁnes l as what may be called the
“electromagnetic Schwarzschild” radius viz., the Compton wavelength, when
e2 is seen as an analogue of Gm2. To push these considerations further, we
have from the theory of black hole thermodynamics [11, 12] for any arbitrary
mass m, the well known Beckenstein temperature given by

(9)

(10)

If we use the pion Compton time for t, in (13), we get for m, the pion mass.
In other words, due to (8), the evanescent Planck mass decays into a stable
elementary particle. We will return to this conclusion from an alternative
viewpoint.

4 Characterizing the Compton Scale

As we have seen, within the Compton scale, an observer can percieve a proton
going from A to B, while another observer could describe the same event as a
neutron going from B to A. The ﬁrst observer, in this particular example also
sees a positive pion, whereas the second observer sees a negative pion. The
question that arises is, what has happened to the charge? The only conserved
quantity would be the baryon number. We will analyse this point now but
remark that there is already an answer (Cf.ref.[18]). The electromagnetic
nature of interaction is what we percieve outside the Compton wavelength.

6

Within the Compton scale, the interaction shows up as the interquark QCD
potential, conserving the baryon number.
The point is, that once it is recognized that the Compton wavelength is
a cut oﬀ, as discussed in detail (Cf.ref.[4]), this implies a noncommutative
geometry

[dxµ, dxν]

βµνl2

= 0

≈
While Equation (14) is true for any minimum cut oﬀ l as shown by Snyder
nearly sixty years ago, it is most interesting and leads to physically mean-
ingful relations, when l is at the Compton scale. In any case given (14), the
usual invariant line element,

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν

has to be written in terms of the symmetric and nonsymmetric combinations
for the product of the coordinate diﬀerentials. That is the right side of
Equation (15) would become

1
2

gµν [(dxµdxν + dxνdxµ) + (dxµdxν

dxνdxµ)] ,

−

In eﬀect we would have

gµν = ηµν + khµν

(16)

So the noncommutative geometry introduces an extra term, that is the second
term on the right side of (16), which plays the role of the usual energy
momentum tensor. All this ofcourse is at the Compton scale of an elementary
particle. As in the case of General Relativity [19], but this time rememebring
that neither the coordinates nor the derivatives commute we have

∂λ∂λhµν

(∂λ∂νhµλ + ∂λ∂µhνλ)

−

ηµν∂λ∂λh + ηµν∂λ∂σhλσ =

kT µν

−

−

It must be stressed that the non commutativity of the space coordinates
has thrown up the analogue of the energy momentum tensor of General
Relativity, viz., T µν. We identify this with the energy momentum tensor.
Remembering that hµν is a small eﬀect, we can use the methods of linearized
General Relativity [19], to get from (17),

Equation (24) too is observed in the Dirac theory, which is an alternative
derivation. Whence, as can be easily veriﬁed, α and β in (20) have the cor-
rect values required for the QCD potential (Cf. also [18]). Alternatively
βr can be obtained, as in the usual theory by a comparison with the Regge
angular momentum mass relation: It is in fact the constant string tension
like potential which gives quark conﬁnement and its value is as in the usual
theory.
In other words (20) now gives the interquark potential with the Coulombic
and conﬁning terms and the right values for the coupling constants..
It can now be seen why within the Compton scale, the charge disappears–at
this scale we deal with quarks, with a conservation of the baryon number.
This would explain the apparently paradoxical feature of Weinberg’s inter-
pretation.

5 Discussion

1. The purport of Equation (13) is that an initial Planck oscillator (with
Planck mass) decays in a time τ , the Compton time of an elementary particle
into an elementary particle which is stable in comparison to the Planck mass.
This conclusion can be obtained from an alternative point of view. Let us
consider the initial Planck scale oscillator as a Gaussian wave packet. Then
it is well known (Cf.ref.[21]) that the wave packet spreads with time, and at
time t, its width is given by

∆x =

σ
√2 s

1 +

2
t2
¯h
σ4m2

(25)

∼

where σ is
∆x. This shows that after a time t which is of the order of
the Compton time of a particle of mass m, the width of the original packet
decays into a width which is of the order of the Compton scale of the particle
of mass m which is the result in (13).
2. We now consider the above results (13) and (25) in the following context:
It has been shown by the author that the photon could be considered to have
1028cms, that is the radius
a mass
of the universe (Cf.ref.[4, 22]). It is interesting that the Planck oscillator can
now be seen to decay via (13) or (25) to the photon mass or equivalently the
energy 10−33eV . It is quite remarkable that this cosmic footprint has indeed

10−65gms and Compton wavelength

been found rather recently [23, 24]. This is the observational conﬁrmation of
the above ideas.
3. It may be mentioned that as shown elsewhere (Cf.ref.[4]) in the successful
Planck oscillator model referred to above (Cf. also ref.[25]), while the collec-
tion of 10120 Planck oscillators is the highest excited state, 1080 elementary
particle scale is a lower energy stable state and 10120 photon scale is the
lowest energy and stablest state.
4. From a geometrical point of view, the Weinberg characterization of the
Compton scale could be expressed in the following way: Special Relativity
gives the hyperbolic geometry of the Minkowski metric. With the introduc-
tion of the Quantum Mechanical Compton wavelength eﬀect as in Section
2, at the Compton time scale, the space geometry itself becomes hyperbolic,
because eﬀectively there is a new coordinate ~r′ such that

where

∼
with a simple transformation of the space coordinates, for a simplicity in one
dimension, this can be written in the form

≈
The Compton wavelength eﬀect is seen to be identical to that of a non com-
mutative geometry with ¯x playing the role of a momentum with a suitable
dimensional constant viz.,

~r2

′2 = τ 2

~r

−

~r′2 <

= l2

x¯x

¯x =

px

¯h

This is exactly the result obtained from a diﬀerent route [26].
Looking at it another way the usual Minkowski geometry deﬁnes the time
like region and the space like region separated by the boundary of the light
cone. Events in the time like region are causally connected and retain their
temporal order whereas events falling outside the light cone in the space
like region can have their temporal order reversed. With the introduction
of the Quantum Mechanical Compton wavelength eﬀect eﬀectively some of
the space like region now becomes a part of the time like region showing
apparently super luminal eﬀects within the Compton region.
5. It may be mentioned that the considerations in Section 4 lead via a non

10

commutative geometry to an energy momentum tensor in (17). We can take
this to be the origin of mass and spin itself, for we have

and via

the equation

while m above can be immediately identiﬁed with the mass, the last equation
gives the Quantum Mechanical spin if we remember that

6. It is interesting to apply the Compton wavelength considerations above to
the photon itself with the mass suggested above and the consequent Compton
length, viz., the radius of the universe itself. This would then lead to the
following scenario: An observer would see a photon leaving a particle A and
then reaching another planet B, while a diﬀerent observer would see exactly
the opposite. The distinction between the advanced and retarded potentials
of the old electromagnetic theory thus gets mixed up.
In fact there is an
immediate explanation for this in the Instantaneous Action At a Distance
theory ﬁrst discussed by Feynman and Wheeler and more recently by Hoyle
and Narlikar [27]. In this case the usual causal electromagnetic ﬁeld would
be given by half the sum of the advanced and retarded ﬁelds, indeed as noted
by Dirac many years ago.

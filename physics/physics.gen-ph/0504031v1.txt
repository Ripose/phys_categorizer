Abstract

G

The turbular geometry (T-geometry) is a generalization of the proper Eu-
clidean geometry, founded on the property of σ-immanence. The proper Eu-
clidean geometry can be described completely in terms of the world fuction
σ = ρ2/2, where ρ is the distance. This property is called the σ-immanence.
Supposing that any physical geometry is σ-immanent, one obtains the T-
geometry
, replacing the Euclidean world function σE by means of σ in
the σ-immanent presentation of the Euclidean geometry. One obtains the T-
, described by the world fucntion σ. This method of the geometry
geometry
construction is very simple and eﬀective. T-geometry has a new geometric
property: nondegeneracy of geometry. The class of homogeneous isotropic
T-geometries is described by a form of a function of one parameter. Using
T-geometry as the space-time geometry one can construct the deterministic
space-time geometries with primordially stochastic motion of free particles
and geometrized particle mass. Such a space-time geometry deﬁned properly
(with quantum constant as an attribute of geometry) allows one to explain
quantum eﬀects as a result of the statistical description of the stochastic par-
ticle motion (without a use of quantum principles). Geometrization of the
particle mass appears to be connected with the restricted divisibility of the
straight line segments. The statement, that the problem of the elementary
particle mass spectrum is rather a problem of geometry, than that of dynam-
ics, is a corollary of the particle mass geometrization.

1 Introduction

The proper Euclidean geometry has been constructed by Euclid many years ago.
The Euclidean geometry was created as a logical construction, describing the mu-

1

tual disposition of geometrical objects in the space. The main object of the Eu-
clidean geometry is the point, i.e. the geometrical object, which has no size. The
straight is the geometrical object which is a continuous set of points. The straight
has a length, but it has no thickness. The plane is a continuous set of parallel
straights. The complicated geometrical objects are combinations of more simple ge-
ometrical objects. The simplest geometrical objects (points, straights, planes, etc.)
are called elementary geometrical objects (EGO). The Euclidean geometry is homo-
geneous and isotropic, and all identical EGOs have identical properties in all places
of the space. Properties of elementary geometrical objects (EGO) are postulated,
and properties of more complicated geometrical objects are obtained by logical rea-
sonings from the axioms, describing properties of EGOs. The distance between two
points P and Q in the Euclidean geometry is introduced as a number, describing the
relation between the straight intercept P Q and some universal scale intercept AB.
In the Euclidean presentation of the Euclidean geometry the distance is a derivative
numerical quantity, which is not used at the Euclidean geometry construction.

On the one hand, the Euclidean geometry is a logical construction, on the other
hand, it is a science on the mutual disposition of geometrical objects. Thus, there
are two aspects of the Euclidean geometry. Any other geometry is obtained as the
Euclidean geometry generalization. One can generalize the Euclidean geometry,
In this case we change properties of EGOs,
considering it as a logical structure.
i.e.
change axioms of the Euclidean geometry. As a result we obtains another

etc.).
straight, can be considered to be a geometry. We shall refer to such a geometry
as the mathematical geometry, because such geometries are interesting mainly for
mathematicians, which train their mathematical and logical capacities, creating and
investigating such geometries.

The geometry as a science on mutual disposition of geometrical objects is inter-
esting mainly for physicists, which use it, describing physical phenomena in the space
and in the space-time. Such a geometry will be referred to as a physical geometry.
The main characteristic of the physical geometry is the distance between two arbi-
trary points of the space. A generalization of the Euclidean geometry is obtained as
a result of a deformation of the Euclidean space. At such a deformation the distance
between points is changed. The identical EGOs in diﬀerent places becomes to be
various and the obtained generalized geometry becomes inhomogeneous. In such a
geometry one cannot use axioms, because the identical EGOs become various after
inhomogeneous deformation. The generalization of the Euclidean geometry cannot
be produced in the same way, as it is produced in the mathematical geometry. Well
known mathematician Felix Klein [1] believed that only the homogeneous geometry
deserves to be called a geometry. It is his opinion that the Riemannian geometry (in
general, inhomogeneous geometry) should be qualiﬁed as a Riemannian geography,
or a Riemannian topography. In other words, Felix Klein considered a geometry
mainly as a logical construction. We seem that the qualiﬁcation of the Rieman-
nian geometry as a physical geometry is more appropriate, than the Riemannian

2

topography, although this point is not essential. It is much more important that
the physical geometry and the mathematical geometry are quite diﬀerent buildings,
because their construction is founded on diﬀerent principles.

∈

In this paper we shall consider only physical geometry, where the mutual position
of geometrical objects is the principal object of investigation. The mutual position
of geometrical objects can be described by distance ρ, which is given for all pairs of
points P, Q
Ω, where Ω is the set of all points of the space. Usually instead of
the distance ρ one considers the quantity σ (P, Q) = 1
2ρ2 (P, Q), known as the world
function [2]. The world function is real even in the space-time geometry, where ρ
may be imaginary. It is very important that the world function of the Euclidean
geometry is the unique quantity, which is necessary for description of the proper
Euclidean geometry. In other words, the proper Euclidean geometry can be described
completely in terms and only in terms of the world function σE of the Euclidean
space. This statement is a very important theorem of the Euclidean geometry,
which can be proved in the framework of the Euclidean geometry. This theorem is
a foundation for construction of all physical geometries.

The property of a physical geometry of being described completely by means of
the world function will be referred to as the σ-immanence property of this geom-
etry. We formulate this important theorem on the σ-immanence of the Euclidean
geometry below, as soon as the necessary technique will be developed. Here we do
note that the proper Euclidean geometry can be constructed as a mathematical ge-
ometry without a reference to the concept of the distance, or of the world function.
The world function σE of the Euclidean space may be introduced, when the proper
Euclidean geometry has been already constructed. Thus we do not need the world
function for the proper Euclidean geometry construction.

The σ-immanence property of the Euclidean geometry was discovered rather
recently [3, 4]. It has been proved that the Euclidean geometry can be presented in
terms and only in terms of the function σE, provided the function σE satisﬁes a series
of constraints, written in terms of σE. By deﬁnition, any geometry is a totality of all

Such a way of the physical geometry construction is very simple. It does not use
any logical reasonings. It is founded on the supposition that any physical geometry
has the σ-immanence property. It uses essentially the fact that the proper Euclidean
geometry has been already constructed, and all necessary logical reasonings has been
already produced in the proper Euclidean geometry.

The application of the replacement (1.1) to the construction of a physical geom-
etry will be referred to as the deformation principle. Any change of distance ρ, or
the world function σ between the points of the space Ω means a deformation of this
space. We construe the concept of deformation in a broad sense. The deformation
may transform a point into a surface and a surface into a point. The deformation
may remove some points of the Euclidean space, violating its continuity, or decreas-
ing its dimension. The deformation may add supplemental points to the Euclidean
space, increasing its dimension. We may interpret any σ-immanent generalization
In other words, the deformation
of the Euclidean geometry as its deformation.
principle is a very general method of the generalized geometry construction.

The physical geometry constructed on the basis of the deformation principle will
be referred to as the tubular geometry (T-geometry) [3, 4, 5]. Such a name is used,
because in the T-geometry the straight lines have, in general, a shape of hallow
tubes, which in some T-geometries may degenerate into one-dimensional curves. At
this point the T-geometry distinguishes from the Riemannian geometry, where the
straight line (geodesic) is one-dimensional by its construction.

Construction of a nonhomogeneous geometry on the axiomatic basis is impos-
sible practically, because there is a lot of diﬀerent nonhomogeneous geometries. It
is very diﬃcult to invent axiomatics for a nonhomogeneous geometry, where iden-
tical objects have diﬀerent properties in various places. Besides, one cannot invent
axiomatics for each of these geometries. Thus, in reality there is no alternative to
application of the deformation principle at the construction of the physical geometry.
The real problem consists in the sequential application of the deformation princi-
ple. As far the deformation principle alone is suﬃcient for the construction of the
physical geometry, one may not use additional means of the geometry construction.
At the physical geometry construction we do not use coordinate system and other
means of descriptions.

Usually a construction of the Riemannian geometry is carried out in some co-
ordinate system. The Riemannian geometry is obtained from the Euclidean one
by means of the deformation principle, i.e. by the change inﬁnitesimal Euclidean
gRikdxidxk.
distance dSE =
Properties of the Riemannian geometry are determined by the form of the metric
tensor gRik. But the form of the metric tensor depends on the choice of the coor-
dinate system. If we use diﬀerent coordinate systems, we obtain formally diﬀerent
description of the same Riemannian geometry. To separate the essential part of
description, which relates to the geometry in itself, we are forced to consider de-
scription in all possible coordinate systems. The common part of descriptions in all
coordinate systems (invariants of the group of the coordinate transformations) forms
the description of the geometry in itself. Unfortunately, we cannot use all possible
coordinate systems. Practically we use only continuous coordinates. The number of
coordinates is ﬁxed, and coincides with the dimension of the Riemannian geometry.
We cannot solve deﬁnitely, whether the continuity is a property of the considered
geometry, or maybe, it is a property of the coordinate description. As a result, most
geometers believe that the continuity is the inherent property of the geometry. They
admit that the discrete geometry may be constructed, but they do not know, how
to do this, because one cannot use discrete coordinates for description of discrete
geometries.

Mathematicians provide physicists with their geometrical construction, and physi-
cists believe that the space-time is continuous. Continuity of the space-time cannot
be tested experimentally, and the only reason of the space-time continuity is the
fact that mathematicians are able to construct only continuous geometries, whereas
they fail to construct discrete geometries.

We have the same situation with the space dimension. Geometers consider the
dimension to be an inherent property of any geometry. They can imagine the n-
dimensional Riemannian geometry, but they cannot imagine a geometry without a
dimension, or a geometry of an indeﬁnite dimension. The reason of these belief is
the fact that the dimension of the manifold and its continuity are the starting points
of the Riemannian geometry construction, and at this point one cannot separate the
properties of the geometry from the properties of the manifold.

In the T-geometry we deal only with the geometry in itself, because it does

5

not use any means of the description. As a result the T-geometry is insensitive to
continuity or discreteness of the space, as well as to its dimension. Application of
additional means of description can lead to inconsistency and to a restriction of the
list of possible physical geometries.

Any generalization of the proper Euclidean geometry is founded on some prop-
erty of the Euclidean geometry (or its objects). This property is conserved in all
generalized geometries, whereas other properties of the Euclidean geometry are var-
ied. Character and properties of the obtained generalized geometry depend es-
sentially on the choice of the conserved property of the basic Euclidean geometry.
For instance, the Riemannian geometry is such a generalization of the Euclidean
one, where the one-dimensionality and continuity of the Euclidean straight line are
conserved, whereas its curvature and torsion are varied. The straight line is con-
sidered to be the principal geometric object of the Euclidean geometry, and one
supposes that such properties of the Euclidean straight line as continuity and one-
dimensionality (absence of thickness) are to be conserved at the generalization. It
means that the continuity and one-dimensionality of the straight line are to be the
principal concepts of the generalized geometry (the Riemannian geometry). In ac-
cordance with such a choice of the conserved geometrical object one introduces the
concept of the curve
as a continuous mapping of a segment of the real axis onto
the space Ω

(1.8)

To introduce the concept of the continuity, which is a basic concept of the general-
ization, one introduces the topological space, the dimension of the space Ω and other
basic concepts of the Riemannian geometry, which are necessary for construction of
the Riemannian generalization of the Euclidean geometry.

The σ-immanence of the Euclidean geometry is a property of the whole Euclidean
geometry. Using the σ-immanence for generalization, we do not impose any con-
straints on the single geometric objects of the Euclidean geometry. As a result the
σ-immanent generalization appears to be a very powerful generalization. Besides,
from the common point of view the application of the whole geometry property for
the generalization seems to be more reasonable, than a use of the properties of a
single geometric object. Thus, using the property of the whole Euclidean geometry,
the σ-immanent generalization seems to be more reasonable, than the Riemannian
generalization, using the properties of the Euclidean straight line.

Now we list the most attractive features of the σ-immanent generalization of the

Euclidean geometry:

1. It uses for the generalization the σ-immanence, which is a property of the
Euclidean geometry as a whole (but not a property of a single geometric object
as it takes place at the Riemannian generalization).

2. The σ-immanent generalization does not use any logical construction, and the
σ-immanent generalization is automatically as consistent, as the Euclidean ge-
ometry, whose axiomatics is used implicitly. In particular, the T-geometry does

6

not contain any theorems. As a result the main problem of the T-geometry is a
correct σ-immanent description of geometrical objects and relations of the Eu-
clidean geometry. There are some subtleties in such a σ-immanent description,
which are discussed below.

3. The σ-immanent generalization is a very powerful generalization.

It varies
practically all properties of the Euclidean geometry, including such ones as
the continuity and the parallelism transitivity, which are conserved at the
Riemannian generalization.

4. The σ-immanent generalization allows one to use the coordinateless description
and ignore the problems, connected with the coordinate transformations as
well as with the transformation of other means of description.

5. The T-geometry may be used as the space-time geometry. In this case the
tubular character of straights explains freely the stochastic world lines of quan-
tum microparticles. Considering the quantum constant ~ as an attribute of
the space-time geometry, one can obtain the quantum description as the statis-
tical description of the stochastic world lines [6]. Such a space-time geometry
cannot be obtained in the framework of the Riemannian generalization of the
Euclidean geometry.

In the paper we discuss the interplay between the Riemannian generalization of
the Euclidean geometry and the σ-immanent one. The fact is that the world function
σ has been introduced at ﬁrst in the Riemannian geometry [2]. The world function
σ plays an important, but not crucial role in the description of the Riemannian
geometry, whereas in the T-geometry the world function σ is the only quantity,
which is necessary for its construction and description.

Let us consider two generalization of the Euclidean geometry

world function σ. Let one of the generalization be the Riemannian geometry

Gσ is determined by the world function σ uniquely
without any logical constructions. It means that the σ-immanent generalization

means of description (manifold, topology), which are not necessary for construction
of the σ-immanent generalization of the Euclidean geometry. One should investi-
gate to what extent the additional means of description are compatible between
themselves and with the given world function σ, which is alone suﬃcient for the
construction of the consistent σ-immanent generalization

In the Euclidean geometry the points P0 and P1 determine the cylinder axis.
The shape of a cylinder depends on its axis and radius, but not on the disposi-
tion of points P0, P1 on the cylinder axis. As a result in the Euclidean geometry
(P0, P2, Q) coincide, provided vectors P0P1 and

We do not try to repeat subscriptions of Euclid at construction of the geome-
try. We take the geometrical objects and relations between them, prepared in the
framework of the Euclidean geometry and describe them in terms of the world func-
tion. Thereafter we deform them, replacing the Euclidean world function σE by the
world function σ of the geometry in question. In practice the construction of the
elementary geometric object is reduced to the representation of the corresponding
Euclidean geometrical object in the σ-immanent form, i.e. in terms of the Euclidean
world function. The last problem is the problem of the proper Euclidean geome-
try. The problem of representation of the geometrical object (or relation between
objects) in the σ-immanent form is a real problem of the T-geometry construction.

Application of the deformation principle is restricted by two constraints.
1. The deformation principle is to be applied separately from other methods of
the geometry construction. In particular, one may not use topological structures in
construction of a physical geometry, because for eﬀective application of the defor-
mation principle the obtained physical geometry must be determined only by the
world function (metric).

The T-geometry construction is not to use coordinates and other methods of

on the constructed geometry. Any means of description is a structure St given on

Thus, a use of additional means of description restricts the list of possible generalized
geometries. For instance, if we use the coordinate description at construction of the
generalized geometry, the obtained geometry appears to be continuous, because
description by means of the coordinates is eﬀective only for continuous geometries,
where the number of coordinates coincides with the geometry dimension.

As far as the σ-immanent description of the proper Euclidean geometry is pos-

the m-dimensional Euclidean space Em. Then we must make the change

At ﬁrst sight the metric space is a special case of the σ-space (2.1), and the met-
ric geometry is a special case of the T-geometry with additional constraints (4.3),
(4.4) imposed on the world function σ = 1
2ρ2. However it is not so, because the
metric geometry is not equipped by the deformation principle. The fact, that the
σ-immanence of the Euclidean geometry, as well as the complex of conditions (2.7)
- (2.14), was not known until 1990, although any of relations (2.7) - (2.14) was well
known. Additional (with respect to the σ-space) constraints (4.3), (4.4) are imposed
to provide one-dimensionality of the straight lines. In the metric geometry the short-
est (straight) line can be constructed only in the case, when it is one-dimensional.

Comparing relation (4.6) with (4.4), we see that the constraint (4.4) is introduced
to provide the straight (shortest) line one-dimensionality (absence of internal points
in the geometrical object determined by two points).

As far as the metric geometry does not use the deformation principle, it is a
poor geometry, because in the framework of this geometry one cannot construct the
scalar product of two vectors, deﬁne linear independence of vectors and construct
such geometrical objects as planes. All these objects as well as other are constructed
on the basis of the deformation of the proper Euclidean geometry.

Generalizing the metric geometry, Menger [8] and Blumenthal [9] removed the
triangle axiom (4.4). They tried to construct the distance geometry, which would
be a more general geometry, than the metric one. As far as they did not use the
deformation principle, they could not determine the shortest (straight) line without a
, deﬁned as a continuous mapping
reference to the topological concept of the curve
(1.8), which cannot be expressed only via the distance. As a result the distance
geometry appeared to be not a pure metric geometry (i.e. the geometry determined
only by the distance).

L

Note that the Riemannian geometry uses the deformation principle in the co-
ordinate form. The distance geometry cannot use it in such a form, because the
metric and distatnce geometries are formulated in the coordinateless form. It is to
use the deformation principle in the coordinateless form. But application of the de-
formation principle in the coordinateless form needs a use of the Euclidean geometry
σ-immanence. K. Menger went to the concept of the σ-immanence, but he stopped
in one step before the σ-immanence. Look at the K. Menger’s theorem [8], written
in our designations

The theorem on the σ-immanence of the Euclidean geometry is obtained from
the Menger’s theorem, if instead of the condition ”any set of n + 3 points of Ω is
isometrically embeddable in En” one writes the condition (2.11), which also contains
n + 3 points: P, Q,
En. In this case the
theorem condition contains only a reference to the properties of the world function
of the Euclidean space, but not to the Euclideaness of the space. (continuity of the

tain non-one-dimensional geodesics (straight lines). But the Riemannian geometries
are not T-geometries, because at their construction one uses not only the defor-
mation principle, but some other methods, containing a reference to the means of
description. In particular, in the Riemannian geometries the absolute parallelism
is absent, and one cannot deﬁne a straight line (5.1), because the collinearity rela-
tion P0Q

a lack of absolute parallelism allows one to go around the problem of non-one-
dimensional straight lines. On the other hand, it makes the Riemannian geometries
to be inconsistent, because they cease to be T-geometries, which are consistent by
the construction (see for details [10]).

The fact is that the application of only deformation principle is suﬃcient for
construction of a physical geometry. Besides, such a construction is consistent, be-
cause the original Euclidean geometry is consistent and, deforming it, we do not use
any logical reasonings. If we introduce additional structure (for instance, a topo-
logical structure) we obtain a fortiﬁed physical geometry, i.e. a physical geometry
with additional structure on it. The physical geometry, equipped with additional
structure, is a more pithy construction, than the physical geometry simply. But it
is valid only in the case, when we consider the additional structure as an addition
to the physical geometry. If we use an additional structure in construction of the
geometry, we identify the additional structure with one of structures of the physical

of possible physical geometries, because coincidence of the additional structure with
some structure of a physical geometry is possible not for all physical geometries, but
only for some of them.

in some physical geometries. Identifying (1.8) and (5.2), we eliminate all discrete
physical geometries and those continuous physical geometries, where the segment
T[PiPi+1] of straight line is a surface, but not a one-dimensional set of points. Thus,
additional structures may lead to (i) a fortiﬁed physical geometry, (ii) a restricted
physical geometry and (iii) a restricted fortiﬁed physical geometry. The result de-
pends on the method of the additional structure application.

Note that some constraints (continuity, convexity, lack of absolute parallelism),
imposed on physical geometries are a result of a disagreement of the means of de-
scription, which are used at the geometry construction. In the T-geometry, which
uses only the deformation principle, there is no such restrictions. Besides, the T-
geometry has some new property of a physical geometry, which is not accepted by
conventional versions of physical geometry. This property, called the geometry non-
degeneracy, follows directly from the application of arbitrary deformations to the
proper Euclidean geometry.

The Minkowski T-geometry is degenerate at all points in direction of all timelike
vectors, and it is nondegenerate at all points in direction of all spacelike vectors. The
Minkowski geometry is degenerate at all points in direction of all vectors. Conven-
tionally one uses the Minkowski geometry, ignoring the nondegeneracy in spacelike
directions.

Considering the proper Riemannian geometry, one should distinguish between
the Riemannian T-geometry and the Riemannian geometry. The two geometries are
described by the same world function. They diﬀer in the deﬁnition of the parallelism.
In the Riemannian T-geometry the parallelism of two vectors Q0Q and P0R is
deﬁned by (5.3). In the Riemannian geometry the parallelism of two vectors Q0Q
and P0R is deﬁned only in the case, when the points P0 and Q0 coincide. Parallelism
of remote vectors Q0Q and P0R is not deﬁned, in general. This fact is known as
absence of absolute parallelism.

The proper Riemannian T-geometry is locally degenerate, i.e. it is degenerate at
all points P0 in direction of all vectors P0Q with the origin at the point P0. In the
= Q0, the proper Riemannian T-geometry is nondegenerate, in
general case, when P0 6
general. But it is degenerate locally as well as the proper Riemannian geometry. The
proper Riemannian geometry is degenerate, because it is degenerate locally, whereas
the nonlocal degeneracy is not deﬁned in the Riemannian geometry, because of the
lack of absolute parallelism. Conventionally one uses the Riemannian geometry (not
Riemannian T-geometry) and ignores the property of the nondegeneracy completely.
From the viewpoint of the conventional approach to the physical geometry the
nondegeneracy is an undesirable property of a physical geometry, although from the
logical viewpoint and from viewpoint of the deformation principle the nondegener-
acy is an inherent property of a physical geometry. The nonlocal nondegeneracy is
ejected from the proper Riemannian geometry by denial of existence of the remote
vector parallelism. Nondegeneracy in the spacelike directions is ejected from the
Minkowski geometry by means of the redeﬁnition of the two vectors parallelism.
But the nondegeneracy is an important property of the real space-time geometry.
To appreciate this, let us consider an example.

Tbr (σd) has a random shape, because any link
wabbles with the characteristic angle √2d/µd. The wabble angle depends on the
space-time distortion d and on the particle mass µd. The wabble angle is small for
the large mass of a particle. The random displacement of the segment end is of the
order µdϑdM = √2d, i.e. of the same order as the segment width. It is reasonable,
because these two phenomena have the common source: the space-time distortion
D.

One should note that the space-time geometry inﬂuences the stochasticity of
particle motion nonlocally in the sense, that the form of the world function (6.1) for
values of σM < 1
d is unessential for the motion stochasticity of the particle of the
mass µd.

2µ2

Such a situation, when the world line of a free particle is stochastic in the de-
terministic geometry, and this stochasticity depends on the particle mass, seems
to be rather exotic and incredible. But experiments show that the motion of real
particles of small mass is stochastic indeed, and this stochasticity increases, when
the particle mass decreases. From physical viewpoint a theoretical foundation of the
stochasticity is desirable, and some researchers invent stochastic geometries, non-
commutative geometries and other exotic geometrical constructions, to obtain the
quantum stochasticity. But in the Riemannian space-time geometry the particle
motion does not depend on the particle mass, and in the framework of the Rie-
mannian space-time geometry it is diﬃcult to explain the quantum stochasticity by
the space-time geometry properties. The distorted geometry

stochasticity and its dependence on the particle mass. Besides, at proper choice of

Further development of the statistical description of geometrical stochasticity
leads to a creation of the model conception of quantum phenomena (MCQP), which
relates to the conventional quantum theory approximately in the same way as the
statistical physics relates to the axiomatic thermodynamics. MCQP is the well de-
ﬁned relativistic conception with eﬀective methods of investigation [11], whereas the
conventional quantum theory is not well deﬁned, because it uses incorrect space-time
geometry, whose incorrectness is compensated by additional hypotheses (quantum
principles). Besides, it has problems with application of the nonrelativistic quantum
mechanical technique to the description of relativistic phenomena.

problem. Besides, why invent the axiomatics? We had derived the axiomatics for
the proper Euclidean geometry, when we constructed it before. There is no necessity
to repeat this process any time, when we construct a new geometry. It is suﬃcient
to apply the deformation principle to the constructed Euclidean geometry written
σ-immanently. Application of the deformation principle to the Euclidean geometry
is a very simple and general procedure, which is not restricted by continuity, convex-
ity and other artiﬁcial constraints, generated by our preconceived approach to the
physical geometry. (Bias of the approach is displayed in the antecedent supposition
on the one-dimensionality of any straight in any physical geometry).

Thus, we have seen that the nondegeneracy, as well as non-one-dimensionality
of the straight are properties of the real physical geometries. The proper Euclidean
geometry is a ground for all physical geometries, and it is a degenerate geometry.
Nevertheless, it is beyond reason to deny an existence of nondegenerate physical
geometries.

7 Corollaries of the nondegenerate space-time

geometry

Possibility of the nondegenerate space-time geometry changes strongly the existing
conception of the microcosm space-time. A small correction to the world function of
the Minkowski space-time admits one to explain the enigmatic quantum nature of
the microcosm. The quantum principles as an addition to the classical picture of the
world appear to be not needed. The quantum principles become to be corollary of
the space-time model. The microcosm space-time geometry changes radically. The
universal transversal length √d (6.13) appears as an attribute of the space-time.
The particle motion becomes primordially stochastic. One does not need to search
for the reason of stochasticity in the sense that the stochastic motion is a natural
motion of any particle, whereas the deterministic motion is a motion of the particle
of the extremely large mass.

In the classical mechanics (Newtonian or relativistic) the natural particle motion
is deterministic. If the particle moves stochastically, one should search for the reason
of the stochasticity.
In the classical mechanics we reduce the stochastic particle
motion to the natural deterministic motion. The stochastic motion is interpreted
In the nondegenerate space-time we must be able to
via the deterministic one.
perceive the stochastic motion directly, without reducing it to the deterministic
motion. It is a very diﬃcult problem, because one needs to create a new conception
of mechanics. Some ideas of such a conception of mechanics one can ﬁnd in [16, 17].

8 Association problems instead of logical ones

Logical problems are absent in T-geometry, because they are supposed to be solved
in the proper Euclidean geometry. Considering the space-time geometry as a T-
geometry, we meet the problem of separation between the geometry and the dynam-
ics.

The physical geometry is a science on mutual disposition of geometrical objects.
But any geometrical object is an abstraction. As a set of points, any geometrical
object does not exist in itself.
In reality we may have some substance, having a
shape of the geometrical object. The set of points (the geometrical object) is an
abstraction of this fact. It is supposed, that we can always to separate the shape of
the substance from its contents.

Classical physics and classical dynamics accept, that the substance may have any
shape. Thus, it is accepted that any set of space points forms a geometrical object,
because any set of points can be ﬁlled by the substance. This suggestion supposes
the unlimited divisibility of the substance and, hence, the unlimited divisibility of
geometrical objects. All this is valid for the usual space.

In the space-time we have another picture. In the classical physics the particle
is the simplest element of substance. Existence of a particle in the space-time is
described by the continuous tube, known as the particle world tube. If the particle

22

is pointlike, the world tube degenerates into the one-dimensional world line. The
arbitrary geometrical object, i.e. an arbitrary set of events (space-time points),
cannot exist. If we suppose that any substance consists of pointlike particles, any
geometrical object is an arbitrary set inﬁnite one-dimendional world lines. Only such
a set of events can be realized in the space-time as a geometrical object, because
such a set may be ﬁlled by the substance. The geometrical object, which can be
realized, i.e. ﬁlled with the substance, will be referred to as the physical object. The
world line of a pointlike particle is supposed to be indeﬁnitely divisible, although
this fact cannot be tested experimentally, because the world line is always inﬁnite
or closed.

The one-dimensional curve (1.8) and its partial case – the one-dimensional straight
form the basis of the Riemannian geometry as well as of the classical dynamics. The
property of the divisibility of the continuous one-dimensional straight is formulated
as follows. Let the straight segment

sisting of inﬁnitesimal straight line segments, the inﬁnitesimal analysis appears to
be the mathematical tool of geometry and physics. The possibility of the world

Lack of unlimited divisibility (ﬁnite divisibility) of the simplest geometrical ob-
ject (the straight segment) leads to the ﬁnite divisibility of more complicated geo-
metrical objects. The ﬁnite divisibility is associated in a way with the ”quantum
nature” of microcosm. The ”quantum nature” of the microcosm is rather cloudy
concept. It means a description of physical phenomena by means of the quantum
mechanics formalism. The ”quantum nature” means something connected rather
with the dynamics, than with the geometry. The ﬁnite divisibility is a property
of the nondegenerate space-time geometry. It is mainly a geometrical property, al-
though there is some reference to the properties of the matter. But it is important,
that the ﬁnite divisibility is such a property, which can be investigated by the geo-
metrical methods, as soon as the world function of the space-time is known. In any
case the concept of the ﬁnite divisibility is less cloudy, than the concept of ”quantum
nature”.

9 The boundary between physics and geometry

Any physical phenomenon takes place in the space-time. Existence of the space-time
is a common circumstance for all physical phenomena. Description of each physical
phenomenon has two sides: (1) the side, common for all physical phenomenon,
known as space-time geometry, (2) the side, speciﬁc for each physical phenomenon,
known as dynamics. It means that some characteristics of the physical phenomenon
are considered as geometrical characteristics, whereas other ones are considered as
dynamical characteristics. The boundary between geometry and dynamics is not
constant. This boundary varies, as the physics developed.

In the time of Isaac Newton the geometry was the most developed branch of
mathematics. Geometrical methods of investigation were dominating. The famous
Newtonian book [12] was written mainly in terms of geometry. Creation of the in-
ﬁnitesimal analysis by Newton and Leibniz, and its application in mechanics changed
the situation. Analytical methods of description and investigation became dominat-
ing. Analytical methods penetrated into the geometry, and the analytical geometry
arose. Further development of the geometry and, in particular, generalization of
the Euclidean geometry was produced by the analytical methods in the framework
of the analytical geometry. The methods of the inﬁnitesimal analysis were eﬀective
at description of only such physical processes, which could be divided into a set of
local processes.

On the other hand, the role of the space-time geometry in the description of the
dynamic systems increased. Some important physical concepts, considered at ﬁrst
as purely dynamical, appeared to have a geometrical origin. The energy-momentum
conservation laws, considered at ﬁrst as properties of dynamical systems, appeared
to be generated by the space-time geometry. The quantum phenomena, considered
in the XXth century as speciﬁc dynamic phenomena, are looking now as generated
by the space-time properties.
In particular, the quantum constant ~ appears to
be a parameter of the space-time geometry. The particle mass appears to be a
geometrical characteristic. Now one may not speak on the special quantum nature
of physical phenomena in microcosm. All they are explained freely by means of
the properties of the space-time geometry. As our knowledge on the microcosm
physical phenomena develops, the role of the space-time geometry increases, and
the geometry – dynamics boundary shifts towards the dynamics.

In general, it seems rather reasonable, that all general physical laws are to have
the geometrical origin, because the space-time is the only common circumstance,
which takes place in all physical phenomena. For instance, the conservation law of
the electric charge and multiplicity of any electrical charge to the elementary one
are to have the geometrical origin, because these phenomena are universal. For the
present these phenomena are not always connected with the space-time geometry.

In the nondegenerate space-time geometry there is no ground for the inﬁnites-
imal analysis, which supposes unlimited divisibility of the physical objects and a
possibility of the primary physical object restoration by its parts. Note that the
It is such a supposition
world tube divisibility cannot be tested experimentally.

25

which is tested by its corollaries.

In such a situation we may not imagine that we can divide the world tube of
a real particle into parts. We are forced to suppose that the division of the world
tube into elementary parts exists objectively, and such a division is not a result
of our method of the world tube description. The diﬀerent divisions of the world
tube correspond to the world tubes of diﬀerent particles. The world tube of a real
particle is a broken tube, i.e. a chain of the connected ﬁnite segments
T[PkPk+1], whose
length is proportional to the particle mass, whereas the vector PkPk+1 describes the
particle momentum. In the nondegenerate space-time geometry one cannot abstract
from the size of the link, which is connected with the particle mass. As a result the
particle mass become to be a geometrical characteristic of a particle. In other words,
the particle mass is geometrized. At the conventional consideration the particle mass
is its dynamical characteristic. Thus, in the nondegenerate space-time geometry the
boundary between geometry and dynamics is shifted towards the dynamics.

Any link has a ﬁnite size, and the conventional mathematical technique of the
inﬁnitesimal analysis does not work in the nondegenerate space-time geometry. The
problem of adequate mathematical description of geometrical objects in the nonde-
generate space-time geometry appears.

10 Interplay of geometric and analytical methods

Construction of T-geometry by means of the local analytical methods appeared to
be ineﬀective. Application of analytical methods to the geometry needs an introduc-
tion of continuous coordinate systems, which restricts strongly the list of possible
geometries. Application of nonlocal ﬁnite methods of description (the deformation
principle) appears to be more eﬀective at the geometry generalization. In the nonde-
generate space-time with tubes instead of straights an application of the diﬀerential
geometry appears to be ineﬀective at the construction of local characteristics of the
space-time geometry.

The fact is that the methods of diﬀerential geometry are connected closely with
concept of the one-dimensional curve as a primary geometrical object of the geome-
try. In the geometry, where the one-dimensional curve is not a physical object, the
local analytical methods do not work eﬀectively. One does not develop the nonlocal
geometrical methods, which are based on the description of the whole geometrical
object, but not on its inﬁnitesimal elements. As a result we were forced to use con-
ventional analytical methods in the quantum mechanics substantiation, founded on
the geometry and statistics, In this case the distortion of the space-time geometry
was considered as a correction to the Minkowski space-time geometry.

Let us consider a simple example, which shows that not only description in
terms of inﬁnitesimal analysis is possible. We consider solution of the Klein-Gordon
equation in the Riemannian space-time. In the Minkowski space-time this equation

the curved space-time, we may use two diﬀerent methods:

1. To solve the equation (10.4).

2. To take the expression (10.2) for the causal Green function, where σ is the
world function of the Riemannian space-time. It may be determined as the
symmetric solution of the Jacobi-Hamilton equation
gik (∂iσ) ∂kσ = 2σ,

σ (x, x′) = σ (x′, x)

(10.5)

The second method is simpler in the sense that the equation (10.5) is the ﬁrst

order diﬀerential equation.

We are not sure the both methods lead to the same result. We do not discuss
here, which of two method is valid. We should like to pay attention to the following
circumstance. The second (integral) method may be applied, at least formally, in
the curved space-time and in the distorted space-time (6.1). In the last case the
world function in (10.2) is taken in the form (6.1). The ﬁrst (diﬀerential) method
cannot be applied in the distorted space-time (6.1) even formally, because it is not
clear how to take into account the space-time distortion.

11 Problems of the T-geometry perception

Although the T-geometry construction is very simple, it appears to be rather dif-
ﬁcult for perception by mathematicians [14].
Its perception is especially diﬃcult
for professional geometers, which know and apply the mathematical formalism of
the diﬀerential geometry. The fact is that the T-geometry cannot be constructed
by means of the formalism of the diﬀerential geometry and that of the inﬁnitesimal
analysis, which is a foundation of the diﬀerential geometry.

The Riemannian geometry is constructed as a generalization of the proper Eu-
clidean geometry, presented in the form of diﬀerential geometry. The generalization
is produced on the basis of such a geometrical object as the Euclidean straight.
Such properties of the Euclidean straight as continuity and one-dimensionality are
conserved at the generalization, whereas such properties as vanishing curvature and
vanishing torsion of the Euclidean straight may be violated. In the Euclidean ge-
ometry, as well as in the Riemannian geometry the concept of one-dimensional con-
tinuous curve is the primary object of the geometry. The concept of the curve is
primary in the sense that any geometrical object may be considered as consisting of
a set of curves. In turn any curve may be considered as consisting of inﬁnite set of
inﬁnitesimal segments of a curve. Inﬁnitesimal segments of a curve can be consid-
ered as inﬁnitesimal segments of the straight. Thus, any geometrical object can be
constructed of inﬁnitesimal segments of a curve (straight), which are the primary
objects of the Riemannian geometry.

On the other hand, the inﬁnitesimal analysis has been invented by Newton and

Leibniz for description of functions

y = f (x)

(11.1)

Such a function describes a curve on the plane (x, y). Any geometrical object can
be constructed of inﬁnitesimal segments of the curve (11.1).
It means that the
inﬁnitesimal analysis is applicable for description of the diﬀerential geometry and,
in particular, for description of the Riemannian geometry. Applicability of the
inﬁnitesimal analysis to problems of mechanics and physics is connected with the fact
that problems of these sciences can be described in terms of curves, or geometrical
objects, consisting of curves.

The T-geometry is the generalization of the Euclidean geometry, founded on the
σ-immanence property of the Euclidean geometry, which can be presented in terms
of the world function σE. The σ-immanence is the property of the whole Euclidean
geometry, whereas the straight is only a geometrical object of the Euclidean geome-
try. The straight is very important geometrical object, but it is only one geometrical
object among many others. Generalization made on the basis of the property of the
whole Euclidean geometry is more preferable, than the generalization made on the
basis of properties of one object. Thus, from the common viewpoint the T-geometry
is more preferable, than the Riemannian geometry. The one-dimensional continuous
curve is not a primary geometrical object of the T-geometry. It can be introduced
as a secondary geometrical object, i.e. as a geometrical object, obtained by inter-

28

section of several primary geometrical objects, for instance, (3.10), (3.11). In some
special cases the ﬁrst order tube may degenerate into the one-dimensional straight.
In this case we may use the means of the inﬁnitesimal analysis. In the general case
the one-dimensional curve is not a primary geometrical object and an application
of the inﬁnitesimal analysis appears to be ineﬀective.

Remark. In the Riemannian geometry the one-dimensional curve is the primary
geometrical object of the geometry. The surface may be constructed of curves.
This fact is reasonable and customary. In T-geometry the one-dimensional curve
is a secondary (derivative) geometrical object, which can be constructed of some
primary objects (surfaces) by means of their intersection. It seems to be incredible,
that in T-geometry the curve is constructed of surfaces. I remember very well, that
I could not perceive this fact for a long time.

The geometry can be described not only in terms of inﬁnitesimal quantities by
means of the inﬁnitesimal analysis. It can be described also in terms of ﬁnite geomet-
rical quantities. Unfortunately, the particle dynamics can be described only in terms
of inﬁnitesimal quantities by methods of the inﬁnitesimal analysis. In contemporary
physics the geometrical methods are not used in the particle dynamics. The particle
dynamics is described in terms of one-dimensional curves (trajectories in the phase
space, world lines in the space-time). The inﬁnitesimal analysis describes these geo-
metrical objects very well. The problem of the geometrical methods application did
not arise in the contemporary particle dynamics.

In the nondegenerate space-time T-geometry (distorted space-time (6.1)) the
particle world tube is not a one-dimensional curve. It is a chain consisting of ﬁnite
non-one-dimensional links.
In the simplest case any link is the straight segment
T[PkPk+1], whose length is proportional to the particle mass m. Quantum eﬀects are
connected with the thickness √d and the length
of the link, and we may
not to tend the length
to zero. Hence, we cannot reduce the problem of the
(cid:12)
particle dynamics directly to the description in terms of the one-dimensional curve
(cid:12)
and solve it by methods of the inﬁnitesimal analysis. Unfortunately, in the particle
dynamics we have no methods of description except for inﬁnitesimal analysis. We
are forced to describe the chain as a one-dimensional line. The link shape (thickness
and length) was taken into account as some stochastic agent. This agent makes the
one-dimensional world line to be stochastic. Statistical description of this stochastic
motion leads to the quantum description in terms of the Schr¨odinger equation. But
such a result we obtain in the simplest case of structureless particle.

Analysis of the free Dirac particle, (i.e. the dynamic system

SD, described by the
Dirac equation) shows [15], that the Dirac particle has a complex structure. This
structure may be interpreted either dynamically, or geometrically. According to the
dynamic interpretation the Dirac particle is a rotator, i.e. two constituents rotating
around their common center of inertia. According to the geometrical interpretation
1, ...
the world tube of the Dirac particle is the chain of links

T[PiQiPi+1] is a triangle with vertices at the points Pi, Qi, Pi+1.
Any link
In the
case of the dynamical interpretation we have a conﬁnement problem, i.e. we are
to explain, what forces coupled the constituents of the Dirac particle. In the case

T[PiQiPi+1], i = 0,

T[PiQiPi+1] of the second order tube, or even a segment

of the geometrical interpretation we are not to explain anything. If in the simplest
T[PiPi+1] of the ﬁrst order tube, then why cannot
case the link may be a segment
it be a segment
T[PiQiRiPi+1]
of the third order tube? The geometrical interpretation seems to be preferable,
because it looks more natural, and besides, it does not contain the conﬁnement
problem. The geometrical approach looks especially attractive in the case of the
T[PiQiRiPi+1], where three vertices Pi, Qi, Ri are associated with three quarks
segment
inside the composite particle. The conﬁnement problem is absent at the geometrical
approach.

Although the model of the Dirac particle is not quite perfect, because internal
degrees of freedom are described nonrelativistically [19], but this model is the best
model of the relativistic particle, and one should not ignore results of its investiga-
tion. Besides, the nonrelativistic character of this model can be corrected [19].

Calculation of the elementary particles mass spectrum is considered now as the
main problem of the elementary particles theory. The problem of the elementary
particles mass spectrum is considered conventionally as a dynamical problem, which
reminds the problem of the atom electromagnetic emanation spectrum. One tries
to solve this problem, searching for an appropriate dynamic system.

In the nondegenerate space-time geometry the particle mass is geometrized, and
one should expect that the problem of the elementary particles mass spectrum is a
geometrical problem, but not a dynamical one. In other words, we should search
for appropriate structure of links, constituting the particle world tubes, but not
for dynamic systems imitating this structure. Investigation of the dynamic system
is based mainly on properties of groups, connected with the structure of the link.
Such indirect investigation is more complicated, than a direct investigation of the
geometrical structure of the link. Besides, considering the dynamical system, we are
to take into account that the dynamical interaction propagates with the speed less,
than the speed of the light. If we consider a structure with the purely geometrical
couplings, we are free of this constraint, because the geometry is more fundamental
part of the description, than the dynamics. The principles of relativity impose
constraints only on dynamic systems, but not on the geometrical objects. We may
solve the conﬁnement problem without introduction of gluons.

The distorted space-time with particles, described by non-one-dimensional world
tubes, sets the problem of adequate mathematical formalism. This formalism is to
deal with the ﬁnite (but not inﬁnitesimal) quantities. Besides, it must be oriented
to diﬀerent geometrical objects (whereas the inﬁnitesimal analysis is oriented to an
inﬁnitesimal segment of one-dimensional curve). Construction of such a mathemat-
ical technique is a very complicated problem. Until such a mathematical technique
is not created, we are forced to reduce the geometrical problems to the dynamical
ones and to use the inﬁnitesimal analysis.

12 Concluding remarks

The T-geometry is a very simple generalization of the Euclidean geometry. Con-
struction of T-geometry expands the class of physical geometries appropriate for
description of the space-time. Among homogeneous isotropic Riemannian geome-
tries there is only one geometry appropriate for the space-time description. This
is the Minkowski geometry. In the class of T-geometries there is a set of homoge-
neous, isotropic geometries. Any homogeneous, isotropic T-geometry is labelled by
the distortion function D (σM), describing the shape and thickness of the timelike
straight segments. One may treat this circumstance as an introduction of the trans-
verse universal length. The free particle motion is primordially deterministic only
in the Minkowski space-time geometry with D (σM) = 0. In all other homogeneous,
isotropic T-geometries the free particle motion is primordially stochastic.

When in the beginning of XXth century it has been discovered, that the free
motion of the small mass particle is primordially stochastic, one should to choose
one of T-geometries with D (σM)
= 0 as a space-time geometry. Unfortunately, in
that time neither the non-degenerate T-geometries, nor the nondegeneracy property
were not known. Researchers were forced to use the Minkowski space-time geom-
etry everywhere, including microcosm. To obtain the corollaries of the stochastic
particle motion and to explain physical phenomena of microcosm, they are forced
to introduce additional hypotheses, known as quantum principles. Because of lack
of any alternative the quantum principles are accorded wide recognition, and now
most researchers speak on the quantum origin of microcosm.

When the T-geometry had been constructed, it became clear, that the physical
phenomena of microcosm can be freely explained by a true choice of the space-
time geometry. There is no necessity to introduce the quantum principles and to
speak about the quantum nature of the microcosm physical phenomena. The quan-
tum nature of the microcosm prescribes to quantize all physical ﬁelds, including
metrical ﬁelds, which describe the space-time properties.
In the nondegenerate
space-time geometry we have the distortion and the ﬁnite divisibility instead of the
quantum nature, and there is no necessity to quantize the metrical ﬁelds. The elec-
tromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds are metrical ﬁelds, because in the 5-dimensional
Klein-Kaluza geometry they describe the properties of the space-time. One failed to
quantize the gravitational ﬁeld, and there is no problem with it. But the electromag-
netic ﬁeld has been quantized successfully, and at this point we have disagreement
between the two approaches. There are no experimental evidence in favour of the
quantization necessity. Experiments show that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is emitted
and absorbed in the form of quanta. This fact may be explained by the properties
of the emitting or absorbing atom. But does the electromagnetic ﬁeld exist in the
form of quanta? We do not know experiments, which could answer positively this
question. Besides, the dynamic equations for the electromagnetic and gravitational
ﬁelds do not contain the quantum constant. Thus, there are doubts in the necessity
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld quantization.

Consideration of the nondegenerate T-geometry as a space-time geometry is the

31

6
third essential revision of our space-time conception.

The ﬁrst essential revision of the space-time conception was the transition from
the Newtonian model of the space-time with two invariants to the Minkowski space-
time geometry with one invariant. The second essential revision of the space-time
conception was the transition from homogeneous space-time geometry to the non-
homogeneous space-time geometry, where nonhomogeneity is generated by the sub-
stance distribution. The third revision of the space-time model is founded on exis-
tence of a new class of physical geometries, having such unknown unusual properties
as the nondegeneracy and lack of the unlimited divisibility. These new properties
of the space-time geometry concerns mainly microcosm. As any revision, the new
conception of the space-time is diﬃcult for perception.
It is valid especially for
those researcher, who believes, that the geometry is a totality of coordinates, metric
tensor, covariant derivatives etc.

Application of the T-geometry to the microcosm physics generates problems,
connected with the further geometrization of physics. Interpretation of new proper-
ties of the T-geometry and a construction of an adequate mathematical formalism
are the main problems of the new conception of the space-time.

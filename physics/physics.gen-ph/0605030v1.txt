Lorentz Invariant Majorana Formulation of the Field Equations and
Dirac-like Equation for the Free Photon

In this paper we present a new geometric formulation (Cliﬀord algebra formal-
ism) of the ﬁeld equations, which is independent of the reference frame and of
the chosen system of coordinates in it. This formulation deals with the com-
plex 1-vector Ψ = E − icB (i is the unit imaginary), which is four-dimensional
(4D) geometric generalization of Majorana’s complex 3D quantity Ψ = E− icB.
When the sources are absent the ﬁeld equations with the complex Ψ become
Dirac-like relativistic wave equations for the free photon. In the frame of “ﬁdu-
cial” observers (the observers who measure ﬁelds are at rest) and in the standard
basis the component form of the ﬁeld equations with 4D Ψ reproduces the com-
ponent form of Majorana-Maxwell equations with 3D ﬁeld Ψ. The important
diﬀerences between the approach with the 4D Ψ and that one with the 3D Ψ
are discussed.

1. Introduction

In Majorana formulation of electrodynamics the Maxwell equations are written
in terms of complex combination of the three-dimensional (3D) vectors of the
electric and the magnetic ﬁelds E and B respectively, Ψ = E − icB, see [1,2].
(The vectors in the 3D space will be designated in bold-face.) In terms of Ψ the
Maxwell equations in vacuum can be cast in a Dirac-like form using the corre-
spondence principle W → ih∂/∂t, p → −ih∇. In that case Ψ∗·Ψ = E2 + c2B2
is proportional to the probability density function for a photon. An important
advantage of Majorana formulation of electrodynamics is that it does not make
use of the intermediate electromagnetic potentials but deals with observable
quantities, the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds.

Covariant Majorana formulation is developed in [2]. There the covariant
form of the complex ﬁeld Ψµ = Eµ − iBµ is introduced. The covariant Maxwell
equation with Ψµ are written only for the free ﬁelds, i.e., when jβ = 0. It is
worth noting that Eµ, Bµ and Ψµ are components that are determined in the
speciﬁc system of coordinates, which we call Einstein’s system of coordinates.
In Einstein’s system of coordinates the standard, i.e., Einstein’s synchronization
[3] of distant clocks and Cartesian space coordinates xi are used in the chosen

1

inertial frame. We also point out that in [2] Eµ and Bµ are treated as the
”auxiliary ﬁelds,” while the 3D vectors E and B are considered as the physical
ﬁelds.

Further generalization of Majorana formulation is presented in [4]. There a
geometric approach to special relativity is developed, which deals with tensors
as 4D geometric quantities. We note that such geometric approach with tensors
as geometric quantities is considered not only in [4] but in [5, 6] as well, while
a similar treatment in which 4D geometric quantities are Cliﬀord multivectors
is presented in [7-10]. The approach to special relativity with 4D geometric
quantities is called the invariant special relativity. In the the invariant special
relativity one considers that the 4D geometric quantities are well-deﬁned both
theoretically and experimentally in the 4D spacetime, and not, as usual, the 3D
quantities. All physical quantities are deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., as
absolute quantities (AQs) or, when some basis has been introduced, they are
represented as 4D coordinate-based geometric quantities (CBGQs) comprising
both components and a basis. It is shown in the mentioned references that such
geometric approach is in a complete agreement with the principle of relativity
and, what is the most important, with experiments, see [5] (tensor formalism)
and [8-10] (geometric algebra formalism). In [4] Sec. 6.3 the invariant Majorana
electromagnetic ﬁeld Ψa is deﬁned as Ψa = Ea − icBa, where Ea, Ba and Ψa
are the 4D AQs with deﬁnite physical meaning and not the ”auxiliary ﬁelds”.
In the same section the ﬁeld equation with Ψa is presented, which for jβ = 0 is
reduced to the Dirac-like relativistic wave equation for the free photon.

In this paper we shall explore a similar Lorentz invariant Majorana formu-
lation in which physical quantities will be represented by Cliﬀord multivectors.
To simplify the derivation of all important relations we shall employ recently
developed axiomatic geometric formulation of electromagnetism [10] in which
the primary quantitity for the whole electromagnetism is the electromagnetic
ﬁeld F (bivector). New Lorentz invariant Majorana form of the ﬁeld equations
and Dirac-like equations for the free photon are reported. The similarities and
the diﬀerences between our Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations with the 4D Ψ and
Majorana-Maxwell equations with the 3D Ψ are discussed.

2. A brief summary of geometric algebra

In this paper the investigation with 4D geometric quantities will be done in the
geometric algebra formalism, see, e.g., [11] and [12]. First we provide a brief
summary of Cliﬀord algebra with multivectors. Cliﬀord vectors are written in
lower case (a) and general multivectors (Cliﬀord aggregate) in upper case (A).
The space of multivectors is graded and multivectors containing elements of a
single grade, r, are termed homogeneous and often written Ar. The geometric
(Cliﬀord) product is written by simply juxtaposing multivectors AB. A ba-
sic operation on multivectors is the degree projection hAir which selects from
the multivector A its r− vector part (0 = scalar, 1 = vector, 2 = bivector,
....). We write the scalar (grade-0) part simply as hAi . The geometric prod-
uct of a grade-r multivector Ar with a grade-s multivector Bs decomposes into

2

ArBs = hABi r+s + hABi r+s−2 ... + hABi |r−s| . The inner and outer (or ex-
terior) products are the lowest-grade and the highest-grade terms respectively
of the above series Ar · Bs ≡ hABi |r−s| , and Ar ∧ Bs ≡ hABi r+s . For vec-
tors a and b we have ab = a · b + a ∧ b, where a · b ≡ (1/2)(ab + ba), and
a ∧ b ≡ (1/2)(ab − ba). In the case considered in this paper Cliﬀord algebra
is developed over the ﬁeld of the complex numbers. Complex reversion is the
operation which takes the complex conjugate of the scalar (complex) coeﬃcient
of each of the 16 elements in the algebra and reverses the order of multiplication
of vectors in each multivector, AB = BA, where, e.g., the complex reversion of
A is denoted by an overbar A.

Any multivector A is a geometric 4D quantity deﬁned without reference
frame, i.e., an AQ. When some basis has been introduced A can be written
as a CBGQ comprising both components and a basis. Usually [11, 12] one
introduces the standard basis. The generators of the spacetime algebra are
taken to be four basis vectors {γµ} , µ = 0, ...3 (the standard basis) satisfying
γµ · γν = ηµν = diag(+ − −−). This basis is a right-handed orthonormal frame
of vectors in the Minkowski spacetime M 4 with γ0 in the forward light cone.
The γk (k = 1, 2, 3) are spacelike vectors. The basis vectors γµ generate by
multiplication a complete basis for the spacetime algebra: 1, γµ, γµ ∧ γν, γµγ5,γ5
(16 independent elements). γ5 is the pseudoscalar for the frame {γµ} .

Observe that the standard basis corresponds, in fact, to Einstein’s system of
coordinates. However diﬀerent systems of coordinates are allowed in an inertial
frame and they are all equivalent in the description of physical phenomena. For
example, in [4], two very diﬀerent, but physically completely equivalent, systems
of coordinates, Einstein’s system of coordinates and the system of coordinates
with a nonstandard synchronization, the everyday (radio) (“r”) synchronization,
are exposed and exploited throughout the paper.
In order to treat diﬀerent
systems of coordinates on an equal footing we have developed such form of the
LT which is independent of the chosen system of coordinates, including diﬀerent
synchronizations, [4] (tensor formalism) and [7] (Cliﬀord algebra formalism).
Furthermore in [4] we have presented the transformation matrix that connects
Einstein’s system of coordinates with another system of coordinates in the same
reference frame. For the sake of brevity and of clearness of the whole exposition,
we shall write CBGQs only in the standard basis {γµ}, but remembering that
the approach with 4D geometric quantities holds for any choice of basis. All
equations written with 4D AQs and 4D CBGQs will be manifestly Lorentz
invariant equations.

As mentioned above a Cliﬀord multivector A, an AQ, can be written as a
CBGQ, thus with components and a basis. Any CBGQ is an invariant quan-
tity under the passive Lorentz transformations; both the components and the
basis vectors are transformed but the whole 4D geometric quantity remains un-
changed, e.g., the position 1-vector x can be decomposed in the S and S′ (rel-
atively moving) frames and in the standard basis {γµ} and some non-standard
basis {rµ} as x = xµγµ = x′µγ′
µ. The primed quantities are the
Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones. The invariance of some 4D CBGQ

µ = .... = x′µ

r r′

3

under the passive Lorentz transformations reﬂects the fact that such mathemat-
ical, invariant, geometric 4D quantity represents the same physical quantity for
relatively moving observers.

3. The relations that connect F with E, B and with Ψ, Ψ

In contrast to the usual Cliﬀord algebra approaches [11, 12], and all other pre-
vious approaches, we have shown in [10] that the bivector ﬁeld F , and not the
3D vectors E and B or the electromagnetic potentials, can be considered as the
primary physical quantity for the whole electromagnetism. From the known F
one can ﬁnd diﬀerent 4D quantities that represent the 4D electric and magnetic
ﬁelds; they are considered in [8] and [9]. One of these representations, which is
examined in [7-9], uses the decomposition of F into 1-vectors E and B

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (B ∧ v)I,
E = (1/c)F · v, B = (1/c2)(F ∧ v)I; E · v = B · v = 0,

(1)

where I is the unit pseudoscalar. (I is deﬁned algebraically without introducing
any reference frame, as in [13] Sec. 1.2.) The velocity v can be interpreted as
the velocity (1-vector) of a family of observers who measures E and B ﬁelds.
That velocity v and all other quantities entering into (1) are deﬁned without
reference frames, i.e., they are AQs.

It is proved in [8, 9] (Cliﬀord algebra formalism) and [6] (tensor formalism)
that the observers in relative motion see the same ﬁeld, e.g., the E ﬁeld in the
S frame is the same as in the relatively moving S′ frame; Eµγµ = E′µγ′
µ, where
all primed quantities are the Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones. The LT
transform the components Eµ from the S frame again to the components E′µ
from the S′ frame, in the same way as for any other 1-vector. For example, the
transformations for the components of the 1-vector E are

E′0 = γ(E0 − βE1), E′1 = γ(E1 − βE0), E′2 = E2, E′3 = E3,

(2)

and the same for the transformations of the components of the 1-vector B. Thus
the Lorentz transformed E′µ are not expressed by the mixture of components Eµ
and Bµ of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds respectively from the S frame. This
is in sharp contrast to all previous formulations of electromagnetism, starting
i of the 3D E′ are expressed
with Einstein’s work [3], in which the components E′
by the mixture of components of Ei and Bi from the S frame. For example, the
transformations for the components of the 3D E are

E′

x = Ex, E′

y = γ(Ey − βcBz), E′

z = γ(Ez + βcBy),

(3)

and similarly for the components of the 3D B, see, e.g., [14] Sec. 11.10. In all
textbooks and papers treating relativistic electrodynamics these usual transfor-
mations of the components of the 3D E (3) and B (e.g., [14] Sec. 11.10) are

4

considered to be the LT, but the fundamental results obtained in [6] and [8, 9]
exactly show that they drastically diﬀer from the LT of the 4D quantities that
represent the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds.

Next we introduce the complex ﬁelds, the 4D AQ Ψ and its complex reversion
Ψ. They are deﬁned in terms of 1-vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds E
and B as

Ψ = E − icB, Ψ = E + icB,

E = (1/2)(Ψ + Ψ), B = (i/2c)(Ψ − Ψ); v · Ψ = v · Ψ = 0.

(4)

The complex Ψ and Ψ are homogeneous, grade-1, multivectors. The meanings
of v and I are the same as in (1).

Using (1) we ﬁnd that the F formulation and the complex Ψ formulation

are connected by the relations

F = (1/2c){(Ψ + Ψ) ∧ v + i[(Ψ − Ψ) ∧ v]I}.

Ψ = (1/c)F · v + (i/c)I(F ∧ v).

(5)

We note that one can construct the formulation of electrodynamics with the
complex 1-vectors Ψ and Ψ as 4D AQs, i.e., Lorentz invariant Majorana for-
mulation of electrodynamics using the relations (5) and the work [10]. Such
formulation is perfectly suited for the transition to the quantum electrodynam-
ics.

4. Lorentz invariant Majorana form of the ﬁeld equation and

Dirac-like equation for the free photon

As already mentioned we shall use the F formulation [10] to ﬁnd the ﬁeld equa-
tion for Ψ. In the F formulation [10] the electromagnetic ﬁeld is represented
by a bivector-valued function F = F (x) on the spacetime. The source of the
ﬁeld is the electromagnetic current j which is a 1-vector ﬁeld and the gradient
operator ∂ is also 1-vector. A single ﬁeld equation for F was ﬁrst given by M.
Riesz [15] as

∂F = j/ε0c,

∂ · F + ∂ ∧ F = j/ε0c.

The trivector part is identically zero in the absence of magnetic charge.

Using (5) and (6) we write the ﬁeld equation in terms of the complex 1-vector

Ψ as

∂ · (Ψ ∧ v) + i [∂ ∧ (Ψ ∧ v)] I = j/ε0.

(6)

(7)

This form of the ﬁeld equation (in which Ψ does not appear) is achieved sep-
arating vector and trivector parts and then combining them to eliminate Ψ.
The equation (7) is the most general basic equation for the Lorentz invariant
Majorana formulation of electrodynamics.

From this ﬁeld equation with AQs one can get more familiar ﬁeld equation
with CBGQs that are written in the standard basis {γµ}. Thus instead of (7)
we have

∂α[(δαβ

µν − iεαβ

µν )Ψµvν ]γβ = (jβ/ε0)γβ,

(8)

5

where δαβ

µν = δα

µδβ

ν − δα

νδβ

µ. The equation (8) can be also written as

∂α[(Γα)β

µΨµ]γβ = (jβ/ε0)γβ,
(Γα)β
µ = δαβ
νρvρgν

µ + iεαβ

νµvν .

We note that the same equation as (9) is obtained in the tensor formalism in
[4]. Observe that our (Γα)β
µ diﬀer from the expression for the corresponding
quantity (γα)β

µ, Eq. (30) in [2].

In the case when the sources are absent, j = 0, and when it is assumed that
the velocity 1-vector v is independent of x, then the ﬁeld equation with the 4D
Ψ as AQ, (7), becomes

v(∂ · Ψ) − (v · ∂)Ψ + i [v ∧ (∂ ∧ Ψ)] I = 0.

Then we introduce a generalization of the correspondence principle that deals
with 4D AQs

ih∂ → p.

Inserting (11) into (10) we reveal Dirac-like relativistic wave equation for the
free photon, which is written with AQs

v(p · Ψ) − (v · p)Ψ + i [v ∧ (p ∧ Ψ)] I = 0.

(12)

If we write Eq. (10) with CBGQs in the standard basis {γµ} then we get an
equation that is very similar to (9)

Remember that v in (10) and (13) is independent of x, whereas (Γα)β
µ is the
same as in (9). When the generalized correspondence principle (11) is written
with CBGQs in the {γµ} basis it takes the form

[(Γα)β

µ(∂αΨµ)]γβ = 0.

γαih∂α → γαpα.

[(Γα)β

µ(pαΨµ)]γβ = 0.

(9)

(10)

(11)

(13)

(14)

(15)

Inserting (14) into Eq. (13) we ﬁnd the following equation

The equation (15) is Dirac-like relativistic wave equation for the free photon,
but now written with CBGQs in the {γµ} basis.

It is clear from the form of the equations (8), (9) (with some general vµ) and
(13), (15) (with vµ independent of x) that they are invariant under the passive
LT, since every 4D CBGQ is invariant under the passive LT. The ﬁeld equations
with primed quantities, thus in a relatively moving S′ frame, are exactly equal
to the corresponding equations in S, which are given by the above mentioned
relations. Thus these equations are not only covariant but also the Lorentz
invariant ﬁeld equations. The principle of relativity is automatically included
in such formulation.

6

In addition let us brieﬂy examine how one can get the ﬁeld equations in the
formulation with 1-vectors of the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld B from
the corresponding Eq (7), when AQs are used, and (8) or (9), when CBGQs in
the {γµ} basis are used. These equations are already obtained and discussed in
detail in [9] and previously in [7]. Substituting the decomposition of Ψ into E
and B from (4) into (7) one gets two equations with real multivectors

∂ · (E ∧ v) + [∂ ∧ (cB ∧ v)] I = j/ε0.
∂ · (cB ∧ v) − [∂ ∧ (E ∧ v)] I = 0.

(16)

(17)

The equations (16) are the same as Eq. (39) in [9]. Similarly, starting with (8)
we ﬁnd

∂α(δαβ
∂α(δαβ

µν Eµvν + εαβµνvµcBν)γβ = (jβ/ε0)]γβ ,
µν vµcBν + εαβµνvµEν)γβ = 0,

which is the same as Eq. (40) in [9]. Of course, these equations, (16) and (17),
are also Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations but with 1-vectors E and B.

5. Comparison with Majorana-Maxwell equations with

the 3D Ψ

Let us now see how our results can be reduced to Majorana-Maxwell equations
with the 3D Ψ. In the presence of sources these equations are

divΨ =ρ/ε0,

irotΨ = j/ε0c + (1/c)∂Ψ/∂t,

(18)

see, e.g., Eqs. (2) in [1]. When the sources are absent, ρ = 0, j = 0, and when
the correspondence principle W → ih∂/∂t, p → −ih∇ is used in (18), then
Eq. (18) with the 3D Ψ leads to the transversality condition and to Majorana-
Maxwell equation in a Dirac-like form

p · Ψ = 0, W Ψ + ip × Ψ = 0,

(19)

see Eqs. (43) and (44) in [2].

As seen from (5) (or (4) and (1)) the complex 1-vectors Ψ and Ψ (or 1-
vectors E and B) are not uniquely determined by F , but their explicit values
depend also on v. Let us choose the frame in which the observers who measure
Ψ and Ψ, i.e., E and B, are at rest. For them v = cγ0. This frame will be called
the frame of “ﬁducial” observers (for that name see [16]), or the γ0 - frame. All
quantities in that frame will be denoted by the subscript f , e.g., Ψf , Ef and Bf .
Furthermore, the standard basis {γµ} will be chosen in the γ0 - frame. Then in
that frame the velocity v = cγ0 has the components vα = (c, 0, 0, 0) and Ψ and
Ψ (E and B) become Ψf and Ψf (Ef and Bf ) and they do not have temporal
components, Ψ0

f = 0. In the γ0 - frame Eq. (8) becomes

0
f = 0, E0

f = B0

f = Ψ

(∂iΨi

f − j0/ε0c)γ0 + (iεki

0j∂kΨj

f − ∂0Ψi

f − ji/ε0c)γi = 0.

(20)

7

All terms in (20) are CBGQs that are written in the {γµ} basis. The equa-
tion (20) cannot be further simpliﬁed as a geometric equation. However if one
compares the components from Eq. (20) and the components from Majorana-
Maxwell equations (18) then it is seen that they are the same. Hence it is the
component form of Eq. (20) (the “ﬁducial” frame and the standard basis {γµ})
which agrees with the component form of Majorana-Maxwell equations with the
3D Ψ (18).

In the case when jµ = 0, and with the replacement (14), Eq. (20) can be

written as

(21)

0jpkΨj

piΨi

f )γi = 0.

f γ0 + (−p0Ψi

f + iεki
The same result (21) follows from Eq. (15) when it is considered in the γ0 -
frame in which the {γµ} basis is chosen. The whole equation (21) is written
with CBGQs in the standard basis {γµ} and cannot be further simpliﬁed as a
geometric equation. Comparing that equation with Majorana-Maxwell equa-
tions (19) we again see that only component forms of both equations can be
compared. From the ﬁrst term (with γ0) in Eq. (21) we ﬁnd the component
form of the transversality condition written with 4D p and Ψf , piΨi
f = 0 (re-
member that in the γ0 - frame Ψ0
f = 0), which agrees with the component form
of the transversality condition with the 3D p and Ψ from Eq. (19), piΨi = 0.
The second term (with γi) in Eq. (21) yields the component form of Dirac-like
equation for the free photon that is written with 4D p and Ψf . It agrees with
the component form of the corresponding equation (19) with the 3D p and Ψ.
Similarly, in the frame of “ﬁducial” observers and in the {γµ} basis, we can
derive the component form of the usual Maxwell equations with the 3D E and
B from Eq. (17). This is discussed in detail in [9].

However, it is worth noting that there are very important diﬀerences between
our Eqs. (20) and (21), or, better to say, our Eqs. (13) and (15), and Majorana-
Maxwell equations (18) and (19). Our equations (20), (21), (13) and (15) are
written with 4D CBGQs and the components are multiplied by the unit 1-
vectors γµ, whereas Majorana-Maxwell equations (18) and (19) are written with
3D vectors and the components are multiplied by the unit 3D vectors i, j, k.
Only in the frame of “ﬁducial” observers and in the {γµ} basis the temporal
component of the complex 1-vector Ψ is zero, but in all other relatively moving
inertial frames this component is diﬀerent from zero. Furthermore in any frame
other than the γ0 - frame the “ﬁducial” observers are moving and the velocity
v has the spatial components as well.

The complex 1-vector Ψ transforms under the LT as every 1-vector trans-
forms, e.g., the components transform as in Eq. (2), whereas the unit 1-vectors
γµ transform by the inverse LT. This gives that the whole Ψ is unchanged,
i.e., it holds that Ψµγµ = Ψ′µγ′
µ as for any other 4D CBGQ. On the other
hand there is no transformation which transforms the unit 3D vectors i, j,
k into the unit 3D vectors i′, j′, k′. Hence it is not true that, e.g., the
3D vector E′=E′
3k′ is obtained by the LT from the 3D vector
E =E1i + E2j + E3k. Namely the components Ei of the 3D E are transformed
by the usual transformations (3), which diﬀer from the LT (2), and, as said

2j′ + E′

1i′ + E′

8

above, there is no transformation for the unit 3D vectors i, j, k. The same hold
for the transformations of the 3D B and consequently for the transformations
of the 3D Ψ. This means that the correspondence of the 4D picture with com-
plex 1-vector Ψ and the 3D picture with Majorana 3D complex vector Ψ exists
only in the frame of “ﬁducial” observers and in the {γµ} basis and not in any
other relatively moving inertial frame, or in some nonstandard basis. Moreover,
that correspondence in the γ0 - frame and in the {γµ} basis refers only to the
component forms of the corresponding equations. Our equations with 4D geo-
metric quantities are the same in all relatively moving inertial frames, i.e., they
are Lorentz invariant equations, whereas it is not true for Majorana-Maxwell
equations with the 3D Ψ.

Similarly it is proved in [9] that, contrary to the generally accepted opinion,
Maxwell equations with the 3D E and B are not covariant under the LT. The
ﬁeld equations for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds that are Lorentz invariant
are, e.g., the equations with 1-vectors E and B, Eqs. (17).

The situation with the physical importance of the 4D ﬁelds Ψ and Ψ and
the corresponding 3D ﬁelds Ψ and Ψ∗ is the same as it is the situation with
the physical importance of the 4D ﬁelds E and B and the corresponding 3D
ﬁelds E and B. The comparison with experiments, the motional electromotive
force in [8], the Faraday disk in [9] and the Trouton-Noble experiment in [10],
strongly support our conclusions that the 4D ﬁelds E and B are not the ”aux-
iliary ﬁelds,” as explicitly considered in [2] and tacitly assumed in all previous
works, but that an independent physical reality must be attributed to such 4D
ﬁelds E and B (or even better to the electromagnetic ﬁeld F , [10]) and not to the
corresponding 3D ﬁelds E and B. More generally, it is shown in [5] that there
is a true agreement, which is independent of the chosen reference frame and the
coordinate system in it, between the theory that deals with 4D geometric quan-
tities and the well-known experiments which test special relativity, the ”muon”
experiment, the Michelson-Morley type experiments, the Kennedy-Thorndike
type experiments and the Ives-Stilwell type experiments. It is also discovered in
[5] that, contrary to the common opinion, there is no such agreement between
Einstein’s formulation of special relativity and the mentioned experiments.

6. Conclusions

The consideration presented in this paper reveals that in the 4D spacetime the
complex ﬁelds, the 4D Ψ and its complex reversion Ψ, are physically important
and well-deﬁned quantities that correctly transform under the LT, whereas it is
not the case with the 3D complex ﬁeld Ψ and its complex conjugate ﬁeld Ψ∗. In
the 4D spacetime Majorana-Maxwell equations with the 3D Ψ, (18) and (19),
have to be replaced with our Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equations with the 4D Ψ.
For j 6= 0 we have presented new Lorentz invariant ﬁeld equation (7) in
which only the 4D AQs are used. Eqs. (8) and (9) are the corresponding ﬁeld
equations with 4D CBGQs written in the standard basis {γµ}. For j = 0 we
have ﬁeld equations for the 4D Ψ, (10) and (12), with 4D AQs and (13) and
(15) with 4D CBGQs.

9

A new generalization of the correspondence principle is introduced by Eq.

(11), where the AQs are used, or by Eq. (14) with CBGQs.

The equations (12) (with AQs) and (15) (with CBGQs) are new forms for
Dirac-like relativistic wave equations for the free photon, which are not yet
reported in the literature, as I am aware. They will be the starting point for the
construction of the observer independent stress-energy vector T (n) (1-vector)
and all other quantities that are derived from T (n), as are the energy density
U (scalar, i.e., grade-0 multivector), the Poynting vector S (1-vector), etc. All
these quantities will be expressed by means of the 4D Ψ and Ψ in a complete
analogy with the construction of these quantities in the axiomatic F formulation
[10].

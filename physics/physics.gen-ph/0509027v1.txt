Abstract

Metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds are used to derive a formula that ﬁnds the
existence of integer solutions to polynomials. These metrics are derived from an as-
sociated algebraic curve, together with its anti-holomorphic counterpart. The integer
points in the curve coincide with points on the manifold, and the metric form around
these points are used to ﬁnd their existence. The explicit form of the metrics can be
found through a solution to the D-terms in a non-linear sigma model.

The metrics on general CY manifolds have recently been computed in [1],[2].
This task was accomplished by using a ﬁeld theoretic count of classical tree graphs
in scalar ﬁeld theories1 In prior work, the metrics of these Calabi-Yau manifolds was
shown to provide means to ﬁnding both solutions to systems of algebraic equations
and non-linear partial diﬀerential equations [3],[4] (with related work in [5]-[7]). In
this work explicit formulae are given that generate the integer solutions to polynomial
equations using the metric form of these manifolds.

Metric Expansions and Integer Solutions

The starting point is the algebraic equation

(2)

σ(i) = 0 ,

with ρ(i) labeling the exponent of the coordinate zσ(i), whose index is labeled by
the set σ(i). To every one of these equations, or sets of these equations, there is a
Calabi-Yau metric. These metrics can be formulated by a quotient construction using
for example a non-linear N = 2 sigma model. The D-term solution of these models
generates the K¨ahler potential, and the D-terms were solved in [2].

The K¨ahler potential on these metrics, in the patch containing the coordinates

at φi = 0 has the expansion,

K =

bω

φω(i) .

X

Y

Due to the polynomial form in (1), there is a resovable singularity at the origin at
φi = 0 in the metric derived from the K¨ahler potential. This is not apparent in the
solution obtained to (2) due to the classical ﬁeld tree diagram count in [1],[2], but it
can be obtained by resumming the series with the numbers bω. The resummations of
the these bω seems complicated, but there is an alternative to obtaining the analytic
continuation that extracts the branch cuts.

The expansion to the metric about any integer sets zi = pi to the equation in (1)
can be obtained by following the same classical graph count in [1]. Expand the form
φi = yi + pi, and reexpress the metric as an expansion

1A subtlety associated with a deformation parameter can be circumvented with a variant of the

procedure involving background φ line dependence.

The coeﬃcients bω(i)(pj) can be obtained, and they have a similar form as to bω(i) but
with dependence on the integers pj. An important feature is that the solution to the
’metric’ even in the presence of a set of integers pj that do not solve the algebraic
equation can be found. The metric around these points is not expected to be Ricci-ﬂat,
and it will not contain the required branch cut representing the resolvable singularity
at the origin; in this case the origin is at yi = 0.

Because the metric can be found at any possible sets of integers pj, the presence
of an actual integer solution can be determined by ﬁnding whether or not there is
a branch cut at the origin about the sets of integers. The analytic continuation of
the sums in bω(i)(pj) are required in order to determine this presence. However, the
explicit form of these coeﬃcients is known due to the solution of the D-terms, which
is found by the classical graph count [1]-[2].

The analytic solution to the metric can also be used to obtain the solution to sets

of arbitrary algebraic equations, including those of Fermat.

Analytic Continuation

There are various ways to analytically continue the inﬁnite sum in the coordinates
to ﬁnd the branch cuts at the origin. A direct sum is a bit problematic due to
the complicated form of the coeﬃcients bω(pj), although this could be done. The
K¨ahler potential, and the metric, form about the origin can be obtained by setting
all coordinates to φi = φ, with φ about the origin at φ = 0.

This analytic continuation is simpliﬁed with the notation

g =

an(pi)xn ,

X

with xn representing the terms φn after substituting φi = φ. The coeﬃcients an
are found from the coeﬃcients bω(pi), which have been computed with the D-term
solution.

The same series in (4) has the expansion in terms of logarithms

(4)

(5)

g =

cn(pi) lnn(x) ,

X

which manifests the branch at the origin. The coeﬃcients cn can be found from those
an. Two explicit contour integrals around the origin will show whether or not there
is a branch cut in the series (4).

The coeﬃcients cn in terms of an are found by diﬀerentiation at x = 1. In terms

of x, the K¨ahler potential derivatives evaluated at x = 1 are,

∂b
xg(x) =

an(pi)

X

n!
(n − b)!

,

and in terms of ln(x), the derivatives are,

∂b
xg(ln(x))|x=1 =

cn(pi)∂b

x lnn(x) .

X

The identiﬁcation

xg(x)|x=1 = ∂b
∂b

xg(ln(x))|x=1 ,

generates the identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients. These identiﬁcations are found in
closed form.

The analytic continuation of the potential about the origin should have the form,

g(x) = axδ + . . . ,

which follows from the removable singularity occuring in the quotient description of
the metric. Multiple branch cuts at points |x| ≤ 1 would not be physical in view
of the quotient of the polynomial Zi → G · Zi, which describes the singularity. The
coeﬃcients a and δ can be found by two successive contour integrals around the origin.

One contour integration follows from,

I1 =

2πiδ

(cos(2πδ) + i sin(2πδ) − 1)

The real and imaginary parts of this integral generate the a and δ, involving the
inversion of the sin and cos function. All of the terms in the integrand which have
integral powers of x integrate to zero. The solution to a and δ follows from,

which can be used to ﬁnd δ. Substituting this parameter into (11) determines a. Un-
fortunately, the inversion of a tan function is required, which slightly complicates the
determination of δ. The determination of I1 follows from integrating the logarithmic
form of the potential with the same contour.

A second contour integral is,

The second integral could be useful with further information of the analytic continu-
ation.

The determination of I1 follows from the same contour integration as used to

determine a and delta. The individual terms integrate as

The evaluation of I1 is simple, but the coeﬃcients of cn(pi) are found from the more
complicated Calabi-Yau data. These coeﬃcients can be found from the classical graph
count.

Solution to Polynomials

Given the solution to the integral I1, which leads to a and δ through its real and
imaginary parts, the counting of the solutions to the polynomials follows from the
non-integrality of the parameter δ. The function tan(2πδ) vanishes whenever δ = n;
the vanishing of the function indicates the non-presence of the polynomial solution.

The singularity in δ can be found from the algebraic curve. With this value,
the summation of the integers pi generates the allowed solutions to the polynomials;
normalizing the tan(2πδ) in the sum generates unity and a direct count of the integer
solutions. Also, the individual polynomial solutions are found by a non-vanishing of
the number tan(2πδ), which is unity after normalization. A Heaviside step function
would work also without normalization, which involves a Fourier transformation, but
this is more complicated.

The existence of a polynomial solution is found from

C(pi) = − tan(2πδ)−1 arctan
(cid:16)

I R(pi)
I I(pi) − 1 (cid:17)

,

which is either one or zero, and I = I1. The complete sum,

N =

C(pi) ,

Xpi

generates the total number of solutions. These functions C(pi) and N depend on the
curve, and are quite explicit due to the explicit form of the Calabi-Yau metric.

Discussion

The explicit form of the Calab-Yau metrics permits a closed form solution to
the existence of integer solutions to polynomials. This closed form requires some
complicated sums, due to the form of the metric expanded around integer points.

A counting function is given that allows the determination of the solutions. The
sum over the integers generates the totality of these integer solutions to the polynomial
equation P (z) = 0, or systems of polynomial equations Pi(zj) = 0. The formulae
are quite explicit in terms of the metric data on the associated Calabi-Yau metric,
expanded about integer points. The well known example of Fermat’s equations, or
their generalizations, are an example. The counting functions are derived from the
explicit form of the metrics associated to the curves, with help from summations.

Detection of the Neutrino Fluxes from Several Sources

It is considered the detection of neutrinos moving from the opposite directions. The states of
the particle of the detector interacting with the neutrinos are connected with the P-transformation.
Hence only a half of neutrinos gives contribution into the superposition of the neutrino states. Taking
into account the eﬀect of the opposite neutrino directions the total neutrino ﬂux from several sources
are in the range 0.5–1 of that without the eﬀect. The neutrino ﬂux from nuclear reactors measured
in the KamLAND experiment is 0.611 ± 0.085(stat) ± 0.041(syst) of the expected ﬂux. Calculations
for the conditions of the KamLAND experiment yield the neutrino ﬂux taking into account the
eﬀect of the opposite neutrino directions, 0.555, of that without the eﬀect that may account for the
neutrino ﬂux observed in the KamLAND experiment.

PACS numbers: 03.65.-w, 28.50.Hw

Let two equal neutrino ﬂuxes move towards the neu-
trino detector from the opposite directions. The ﬁrst
neutrino ﬂux moves from the x direction, and the second
neutrino ﬂux moves from the
x direction. The probabil-
ity of the weak interaction of the particle of the detector
with a single neutrino is given by

where g is the weak coupling, ψp is the state of the parti-
cle of the detector, ψν is the state of neutrino, ψ1, ψ2 are
the states of the particles arising in the interaction. The
probability given by eq. (1) is too small to register the
event in a single interaction of the particle of the detector
with the neutrino. The probability of the event is a sum
of probabilities of a number of interactions.

To deﬁne the probability of interaction of the particle
of the detector with two neutrinos moving from the oppo-
site directions one should form the superposition of the
particle of the detector and neutrino states. The state
of the particle interacting with the neutrino moving from
the x direction and the state of the particle interacting
with the neutrino moving from the
x direction are con-
nected with the P-transformation

Since the P-transformation is forbidden for neutrino, one
cannot form the superposition given by eq. (3). Hence
only a half of neutrinos moving from the opposite di-
rections gives contribution into the superposition of the
neutrino states. Therefore the sum of probabilities of
interaction of the particle with neutrinos moving from
the opposite directions is two times smaller than that for
the case when all neutrinos move in one and the same
direction

Let the detector measure the neutrino ﬂuxes Fi from N
sources placed in the plane xy. When not taking into ac-
count the eﬀect of the opposite neutrino directions given
by eq. (4) the total neutrino ﬂux is

where one should sum the ﬂuxes ~Fix, ~Fiy as vectors. One
can see that the neutrino ﬂux given by eq. (9) are within
the range 0.5–1 of the neutrino ﬂux given by eq. (5).

In the KamLAND experiment [1], it is measured the
ﬂux of ¯νe’s from distant nuclear reactors. The ratio of
the number of observed events to the expected num-
ber of events is reported [2] to be 0.611
±
0.041(syst). Using the data on the location and ther-
mal power of reactors [3] one can estimate the neutrino
ﬂux from reactors which is approximately proportional
to the thermal power ﬂux Pth/4πL2, where Pth is the re-
actor thermal power, L is the distance from the detector
to the reactor. Hence one can estimate the eﬀect of the
opposite neutrino directions through the ratio of the neu-
trino ﬂux calculated with eq. (9) and that calculated with

0.085(stat)

±

eq. (5). More than 99% of the neutrino ﬂux measured in
the KamLAND experiment comes from Japanese and Ko-
rean nuclear reactors. So in the ﬁrst approximation one
can calculate the neutrino ﬂux only from Japanese and
Korean nuclear reactors. Calculations for the conditions
of the KamLAND experiment yield the ratio of the neu-
trino ﬂux taking into account the eﬀect of the opposite
neutrino directions and that without this eﬀect, 0.555.
Thus the eﬀect of the opposite neutrino directions may
account for the neutrino ﬂux observed in the KamLAND
experiment. Note that the value 0.555 is obtained with
the use of the speciﬁcation data on the reactor thermal
power. To obtain the real value one should use the op-
eration data on the reactor thermal power for the period
of measurement.

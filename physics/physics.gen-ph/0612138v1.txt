Abstract

The third modiﬁcation of the space-time geometry is considered.

(The
ﬁrst modiﬁcation is the spacial relativity, the second one is the general rela-
tivity.) After the third modiﬁcation of the space-time geometry the motion of
free particles become to be primordially stochastic (multivariant). This cir-
cumstance forces one to construct a multivariant dynamics. The multivariant
dynamics is the classical dynamics in the non-Riemannian space-time geome-
try. The multivariant dynamics explains quantum eﬀects without a reference
to the quantum principles. Elimination of quantum principles admits one
to solve the main problem of relativistic quantum theory: uniﬁcation of the
principles of relativity with the nonrelativistic quantum principles.

1 Introduction

In the 20th century dynamics was developed mainly by means of modiﬁcation of
the space-time model. Two essential modiﬁcations of the space-time geometry were
produced by Albert Einstein. The ﬁrst modiﬁcation solved the problem of motion
with large velocities. It is known as the special relativity. The ﬁrst modiﬁcation led
to Minkowski space-time as a result of replacement of two invariants of the event
space by one invariant.

The second modiﬁcation is known as the general relativity. This modiﬁcation led
to the Riemannian space-time geometry, which is a result of inﬂuence of the matter
distribution on the space-time curvature.

The third modiﬁcation has not yet a short name. This modiﬁcation led to non-
Riemannian space-time geometry (T-geometry). This modiﬁcation of the space-time
geometry admitted one to describe quantum phenomena in the framework of the

1

classical dynamics (the quantum principles are not used). In the non-Riemannian
space-time geometry the motion of free particles is multivariant (stochastic), and
one needs a special multivariant dynamics, which must be compatible with the
space-time geometry. Note that the space-time geometry in itself is single-variant
(deterministic), whereas the motion of particles in the single-variant space-time is
multivariant (stochastic). This is a corollary of the multivariance of the parallelism
concept.

In the Minkowski space-time geometry the deterministic motion is natural in the
sense, that there are no special reasons for the deterministic motion. The natural
stochastic motion in the Minkowski geometry is impossible. The stochastic motion
is artiﬁcial in the sense, that there must be some special reason for the stochasticity.
In the non-Riemannian space-time the motion of any particle is stochastic and
there is no special reason for the stochasticity. In this sense the stochastic motion is
natural. We shall use a special term ”multivariant motion” for the natural stochastic
motion. In some special case (the particle of large mass) the multivariant motion
degenerates into the single-variant (deterministic) motion, which is a special case of
the multivariant motion.

The conception, generated by the third modiﬁcation of the space-time geometry,
It has the

following properties.

1. It is a model conception, whereas the conventional quantum mechanics is an

axiomatic one.

2. It uses dynamical methods, which are not constrained by quantum princi-
ples. The dynamical methods admit one to obtain results, which cannot be
obtained in the framework of conventional quantum mechanics: for instance,
incompatibility of the Copenhagen interpretation with the formalism of quan-
tum mechanics [1, 2], existence of internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac
particle, which are described nonrelativistically [3, 4, 5, 6], and the nature of
the pair production mechanism [7].

3. The fact, that the conception is more fundamental (primary), than the con-

ventional quantum description, is of most importance.

We can see this in the ﬁgure 1, where one presents some fundamental conception,
based on some primary (fundamental) propositions, which are shown in the bottom.
In the top we see experimental data, which may be explained by means of corollaries
of the primary propositions. It is possible such a situation: the experimental data
may be explained by means of a set of corollaries, placed near the experimental
data, without a direct reference to primary propositions of the fundamental theory.
In this case the list of these propositions may be considered as primary propositions
of some theory (a curtailed theory). This curtailed theory may be considered to be
a self-suﬃcient theory, which does not need references to the fundamental theory
and does not use these references. The curtailed theory contains more primary

2

propositions, than the fundamental conception does, because it contains corollaries
of the primary propositions of the fundamental theory, obtained in application to
nonrelativistic phenomena.

If we do not know primary principles of the fundamental theory, we cannot
separate, what in the primary propositions of the curtailed theory is conditioned
by the primary propositions of the fundamental theory and what is conditioned
by the nonrelativistic character of the described phenomena. In this case one may
perceive the curtailed theory as a fundamental theory with primary propositions
other, than those of the fundamental theory. The curtailed theory is axiomatic as
a rule. Its application to explanation of experimental data is easier and simpler,
than the application of the fundamental theory, because some corollaries of the
fundamental theory are contained in the curtailed theory in a ready form.

From the practical viewpoint the applications of the curtailed theory is simpler,
than the application of the fundamental theory. The curtailed theory looks as a
simpler theory, which is more convenient for explanation of experimental data, than
the fundamental theory. Besides, as a rule, the curtailed theory is obtained ear-
lier, than the fundamental theory, because its primary propositions are nearer to
experimental data and it is simpler, than the fundamental theory. For instance, the
axiomatic thermodynamics (curtailed theory) had been constructed earlier, than
the statistical physics (kinetic theory), which is a fundamental theory with respect
to thermodynamics. As a rule, a transition from a known curtailed theory to the
corresponding unknown fundamental theory is diﬃcult for perception of researchers.
The nonrelativistic quantum theory is a curtailed theory, and there is a funda-
mental theory for the nonrelativistic quantum theory. Unfortunately, at the present
stage of the science development, most researchers consider the nonrelativistic quan-
tum mechanics as a fundamental theory. The primary propositions contain quantum
principles, which are nonrelativistic. As a result the problem of the relativistic quan-
tum theory construction is formulated as a join of nonrelativistic quantum principles
with the principles of relativity. Such a statement of problem is inconsistent.

The true statement of the problem is formulated as follows. One needs to sepa-
rate the nonrelativistic character of described phenomena from the primary propo-
sitions of the theory. It means that one needs to construct a fundamental theory,
whose primary propositions are insensitive to the character (relativistic or nonrela-
tivistic) of the described phenomena.

2 Why do we need T-geometry?

In the thirties of the 20th century, one had discovered that free microparticles move
stochastically. Motion of free particles depends only on the space-time geometry.
To explain the stochasticity of the particle motion, the space-time geometry was
to possess the following properties. Motion of a free particle in such a space-time
geometry is primordially stochastic (multivariant).
Intensity of this stochasticity
(multivariance) is to depend on the particle mass. Such a geometry was not known

3

till the nineties of the 20th century.

In T-geometry the property of parallelism is intransitive, i.e.

if we have the
relations a k b and b k c for vectors a,b,c , then, in general, vector a is not in parallel
with vector c. In reality, in T-geometry there are many vectors b1, b2, ..., which are
in parallel with vector a, but they are not in parallel between themselves. The
intransitivity of parallelism is connected with the multivariance of the parallelism,
which means, that there are many vectors (directions) b1, b2, ..., which are in parallel
with the vector (direction) a, but are not in parallel between themselves.

The world lines of free particles are shown in Figure 2. In the ﬁrst case the world
line is shown in the Minkowski space-time. In the second case the multivariant world
line is shown in the space-time with intransitive parallelism. In the ﬁrst case we have
the conventional single-variant dynamics of the special relativity. In the second case
one succeedes to construct the corresponding multivariant dynamics (or a statistical
description). Such a dynamics is obtained, when the single particle (world line) is
replaced by a statistical ensemble of particles (world lines).

3 Construction of T-geometry

Any generalized geometry is obtained as a result of a deformation of the proper
Euclidean geometry. The proper Euclidean geometry is formalized, i.e. any state-
ment S and any geometrical object O is represented in terms of the Euclidean
world function σE in the form S (σE) and O (σE) respectively. (There is a theorem,
which states that it is always possible [9]). The set of all S (σE) and O (σE) forms
the proper Euclidean geometry. The world function [8] is deﬁned by the relation
σ (P, Q) = 1
2ρ2 (P, Q), where ρ (P, Q) is a distance between the points P and Q. It
has the properties

σ (P, P ) = 0,

σ (P, Q) = σ (Q, P ) ,

∀P, Q ∈ Ω

(3.1)

To obtain some generalized geometry G, described by the world function σ, it
is suﬃcient to replace σE by σ in all expressions S (σE) and O (σE). Then the set
of all S (σ) and O (σ) forms the generalized geometry G, described by the world
function σ.

The representation of the proper Euclidean geometry in the formalized (σ-immanent)

form does not contain any theorems. All theorems are replaced by deﬁnitions.
We shall explain this in the example of the cosine theorem, which states
|BC|2 = |AB|2 + |AC|2 − 2 (AB.AC)

(3.2)

= |AB|2 + |AC|2 − 2 |AB| |AC| cos α

where the points A, B, C are vertices of a triangle, |BC|, |AB|, |AC| are lengths of
the triangle sides and α is the angle 6 BAC. The relation (3.2) is the cosine theorem
which is proved on the basis of the axioms of the proper Euclidean geometry.

Using expression of the length of the triangle side AB via the world function σ

|AB| =

2σ (A, B)

(3.3)

p
4

we may rewrite the relation (3.2) for |BC|2 in the form

(AB.AC) = σ (A, B) + σ (A, C) − σ (B, C)

(3.4)

This relation is a deﬁnition of the scalar product (AB.AC) of two vectors AB and
AC, having the common origin A. Thus, the theorem is replaced by the deﬁnition of
a new concept (the scalar product), which appears now not to be connected directly
with the concept of the linear space.

Another example the Pythagorean theorem for the rectangular triangle ABC

with the right angle 6 BAC. It is written in the form

|BC|2 = |AB|2 + |AC|2

In the formalized form (in T-geometry) we have a deﬁnition of the right angle6 BAC
instead of the Pythagorean theorem. In terms of the world function this deﬁnition
has the form. The angle 6 BAC is right, if the relation

σ (A, B) + σ (A, C) − σ (B, C) = 0

(3.5)

takes place.

Thus, the cosine theorem turns into the deﬁnition of the scalar product, whereas
the Pythagorean theorem turns into the deﬁnition of the right angle. In a like way
all theorems of the Euclidean geometry turn into deﬁnitions.

Thus, we see that theorems of the proper Euclidean geometry are replaced by
deﬁnitions of T-geometry. The situation is very unusual and strange for mathemati-
cians, who cannot imagine any geometry without theorems, because formulation
and proof of theorems is the main work of geometers. Many of geometers cannot
accept the geometry without theorems, i.e. the formalized form of the Euclidean
geometry.

In reality, the Euclidean geometry is taken into account in the process of the
Euclidean geometry formalization. The conventional method of the generalized ge-
ometry construction repeats all the Euclidean constructions at other original axioms.
The alternative method, based on the deformation principle, does not need a repeti-
tion of all Euclidean constructions at the obtaining of the generalized geometry. All
Euclid’s results are contained in the formalized (σ-immanent) form of the Euclidean
geometry.

4 Parallelism of remote vectors. Multivariance of

parallelism

Scalar product (P0P1.Q0Q1) of two remote vectors P0P1, Q0Q1 is deﬁned by the
σ-immanent relation

(P0P1.Q0Q1) = σ (P0, Q1) + σ (P1, Q0) − σ (P0, Q0) − σ (P1, Q1)

(4.1)

Two vectors P0P1, Q0Q1 are linear dependent (collinear P0P1||Q0Q1), if the

Gram determinant

(4.2)

or

P0P1||Q0Q1 :

(P0P1.Q0Q1)2 = |P0P1|2 |Q0Q1|2

(4.3)

Here we see the deﬁnition of the linear dependence of two vectors, which does not
refer to the linear space. Again the theorem on necessary and suﬃcient condition of
linear dependence turns into deﬁnition of the linear dependence.

The set of such points R, that the vector Q0R is collinear with the vector P0P1,
forms the straight (tube) TQ0;P0P1, passing through the point Q0 collinear to the
vector P0P1.

TQ0;P0P1 = (R|P0P1||Q0R)

(4.5)

in general,
If the straight passes in the four-dimensional space, the straight is,
three-dimensional surface (multivariant straight).
In the Minkowski space-time
the straight TQ0;P0P1 is one-dimensional (single-variant), if the vector P0P1 is time-
like (σ (P0, P1) > 0). The straight TQ0;P0P1 in the Minkowski space-time is three-
dimensional (multivariant), if the vector P0P1 is spacelike (σ (P0, P1) < 0).
It
is a reason, why one cannot discover taxyons, when one searches them as one-
dimensional spacelike lines.

If the space-time is deformed in such a way, that the world function σd has the

form

σd = σM + d (σM) ,

Here σM is the world function of the Minkowski space-time, the quantities ¯h, b, c
are constants.

and |PiPi+1| = µ,

In the case of Minkowski space-time and timelike vector P0P1, one obtains the
one-dimensional (single-variant) straight line, passing through the points P0, P1.

In the case of the distorted space-time, described by the world function σd, the
world line of a free particle has the shape of a multivariant broken tube. To describe
such world tubes one needs a multivariant dynamics.

5 Multivariant dynamics

Sir Isaac Newton had constructed his deterministic (single-variant) dynamics for
the Newtonian conception of space-time. The single-variant dynamics is used for
description of relativistic particles. However, for description of multivariant world
lines, one needs a multivariant dynamics. Multivariant dynamics is used for descrip-
tion of particle motion in the Newtonian space-time, or in the Minkowski space-time,
when the initial conditions are not known exactly. In this case one uses the concept
of the statistical ensemble.

We display in the example of free nonrelativistic particles, how the statistical
ensemble is introduced without a reference to the probability theory, (i.e. only
dynamically). The action ASd for the free deterministic particle Sd has the form

where x = x (t).

where x = x (t, ξ) is a 3-vector function of independent variables t, ξ =

The variables (Lagrangian coordinates) ξ label particles Sd of the statistical ensem-
(cid:9)
ble E [Sd]. The statistical ensemble E [Sd] is a dynamic system of hydrodynamic
type. Note that the number n of variables ξ1,ξ2, ...ξn may be chosen arbitrary, but it
is useful to choose them in such a way, that the relations x = x (t, ξ) may be resolved
in the form ξ = ξ (t, x). In this case we set n = 3. The statistical ensemble E [Sd]
realizes a multivariant description in the sense, that diﬀerent values of ξ describe
diﬀerent world lines, determined by diﬀerent initial conditions.

ξ1,ξ2, ...ξn

(cid:8)

If the particle S = S st is stochastic, dynamic equations for the statistical ensem-
ble E [Sst] exist, whereas there are no dynamic equations for the single stochastic
particle Sst.

As a rule the statistical ensemble E [S] is considered as a derivative object. The
basic object is a single dynamic system. To construct the multivariant dynamics,
we shall consider the statistical ensemble E [S] as a basic object, whereas the single
particle is considered as a partial case of the statistical ensemble with δ-like initial
data.

7

In the case of deterministic dynamic system Sd the dynamic equations, generated
by the action for the single particle Sd, and those, generated by the statistical
ensemble E [Sd], are similar

d2x
dt2 = 0
The objects Sd and E [Sd] distinguish in the relation, that Sd is described by one
vector function x = x (t), whereas E [Sd] is described by many diﬀerent functions
x = x (t, ξ). In this case it is of no importance, which of two objects: S or E [S] is
basic.

(5.3)

But for the stochastic particles the choice of basic object is important. If the
statistical ensemble E [S] is a basic object, the dynamic equations exist always for
it. The fact, that there are no dynamic equations for a single stochastic particle is
of no importance, because the single particle is not a basic object, and the dynamics
is a dynamics of basic objects (statistical ensembles).

Thus, choosing the statistical ensemble as a basic object of dynamics, we may

construct a multivariant dynamics.

is deﬁned in the coordinate space of x. Note that the transition from the statistical
ensemble E [Sd] to the statistical ensemble E [Sst] is purely dynamic. The concept
of probability is not used. The character of stochasticity is determined by the form
of two last terms in the action (5.4) for E [Sst] . For instance, if we replace ∇vdf
by some function f (∇vdf), we obtain another type of stochasticity, which does not
coincide with the quantum stochasticity.

The action for the single stochastic particle is obtained from the action (5.4) for

E [Sst] by omitting integration over ξ. We obtain the action

where x = x (t) , udf = udf (t, x). However, this action has only a symbolic sense,
as far as the operator ∇ is deﬁned in some vicinity of the point x, but not at the

8

point x itself. It means, that this action does not determine dynamic equations for
the single particle Sst, and the particle appears to be stochastic, although dynamic
equations exist for the statistical ensemble of such particles. They are determined
by the action (5.4) for E [Sst]. Thus, the particles described by the action for E [Sst]
are stochastic, because there are no dynamic equations for a single particle. In the
case, when the quantum constant ¯h = 0, the actions (5.4) for Sst and (5.2) for Sd
coincide, because in this case it follows from dynamic equation, that udf = 0.

By means of the proper change of variables these equations can be reduced to the
Schr¨odinger equation [10].

However, there is a serious mathematical problem here. The fact is that the
hydrodynamic equations are to be integrated, in order they can be described in
terms of the wave function. The fact, that the Schr¨odinger equation can be written
in the hydrodynamic form, is well known [11]. However, the inverse transition from
the hydrodynamic equations to the description in terms of wave function was not
known until the end of the 20th century [10], and the necessity of integration of
hydrodynamic equations was a reason of this fact.

Derivation of the Schr¨odinger equation as a partial case of dynamic equations,
describing the statistical ensemble of random particles, shows that the wave function
is simply a method of description of hydrodynamic equations, but not a speciﬁc
quantum object, whose properties are determined by the quantum principles. At
such an interpretation of the wave function the quantum principles appear to be su-
perﬂuous, because they are necessary only for explanation, what is the wave function
and how it is connected with the particle properties. All remaining information is
contained in the dynamic equations. It appears that the quantum particle is a kind
of stochastic particle, and all its exhibitions can be interpreted easily in terms of
multivariant dynamics (in terms of the statistical ensemble of stochastic particles).
The idea of that, the quantum particle is simply a stochastic particle, is quite
natural. It was known many years ago. However, the mathematical form of this

9

idea could not be realized for a long time because of the two problems considered
above (incorrect conception on the statistical ensemble of relativistic particles and
necessity of integration of the hydrodynamic equations).

One can show, that quantum systems are a special sort of dynamic systems,
which could be obtained from the statistical ensemble of classical dynamic systems
by means of a change of parameters P of the dynamic system by its eﬀective value
Peﬀ. In particular, the free uncharged particle is described by an unique parameter:
its mass m.

Thus, we see that the proper modiﬁcation of the space-time geometry gener-
ates the multivariant dynamics, which describes quantum phenomena without any
additional suppositions. It means, that we obtain a fundamental theory, which re-
places the curtailed theory (conventional nonrelativistic quantum mechanics). Hav-
ing a fundamental theory, we may hope to construct the relativistic quantum theory
without any additional hypotheses.

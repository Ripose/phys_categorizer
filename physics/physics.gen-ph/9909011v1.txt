SPACE TIME AS A RANDOM HEAP

Abstract

In this paper, we demonstrate how space-time is, rather than a
diﬀerentiable manifold, a Random Heap, and how this ties up with
fractal dimension 2 of a Quantum Mechanical path. In this light, we
can see that there is a harmonious convergence between the stochastic
approach of Nelson and the de Broglie-Bohm approach. These consid-
erations are shown to lead to the emergence of special relativity and
Quantum Mechanics.

1 Introduction

Space time has generally been taken to be a diﬀerential manifold with an
Euclidean (Galilean) or Minkowskian or Riemannian character. Though
the Heisenberg Principle in Quantum Theory forbids arbitrarily small space
time intervals, the above continuum character with space time points has
been taken for granted. Indeed it has been suggested by Snyder, Lee and
others[1, 2, 3, 4] that the inﬁnities which plague Quantum Field Theory are
symptomatic of the fact that space time has a granular or discrete character.
This has lead to a consideration of extended particles, as against point par-
ticles of conventional theory. Wheeler’s space time foam and strings[5, 6] are
in this class, with a minimum cut oﬀ at the Planck scale. This has also lead
to a review of the conventional concept of a rigid background space time.
More recently [4, 7, 8], it has been pointed out that it is possible to give a
stochastic underpinning to space time and physical laws. This is in the spirit

of what Wheeler calls, ”Law without Law”[9].
In the light of the above remarks, we now point out that space time is fractal
and can be considered to be what may be termed a Brownian or Random
Heap. This would be at the root of Quantum behaviour.

2 The Random Heap

What distinguishes Quantum Theory from Classical Physics is the role of the
resolution of the observer or observing apparatus. Indeed as noted by Abbot
and Wise[10], in this respect the situation is similar to everywhere continuous
but non diﬀerenciable curves, the fractals of Mandelbrot [11]. This again is
tied up with the Random Walk or Brownian character of the Quantum path
as noted by Sornette and others[12]: At scales larger than the Compton
wavelength but smaller than the de Broglie wavelength, the Quantum paths
have the fractal dimension 2 of Brownian paths (cf. also Nottale,[13]). It
must be noticed that both these length scales involve the mass. It will be
seen below that this is quite meaningful.
Two important characteristics of the Compton wavelength have to be re-
emphasized (Cf.[4, 8]): On the one hand with a minimum space time cut oﬀ
at the Compton wavelength, we can recover by a simple coordinate shift the
Dirac structure for the equation of the electron, including the spin half. In
this sense the spin half, which is purely Quantum Mechanical is symptomatic
of the minimum space time cut oﬀ, as is also suggested by the Zitterbewegung
interpretation of Dirac (in terms of the Uncertainity Principle), Hestenes and
others[14, 15, 16]. The Zitterbewegung is symptomatic of the fact that by
the Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle, Physics begins only after an averaging
over the minimum space time intervals. This is also suggested by stochastic
models of Quantum Mechanics, both non relativistic and relativistic[17, 18,
19, 4].
The other aspect is that the Compton wavelength l of a typical elementary
particle, the pion is given by the well known empirical ”Large Number”
relation

number of elementary particles in the universe. As pointed out,[4, 8] (1) is
also the Random Walk relation. Infact (1) and a similar equation for the

were the starting point for a uniﬁed scheme for physical interactions and in-
deed a cosmology consistent with observation. It was pointed out [20] that
in the spirit of Wheeler’s travelling salesman’s ”practical man’s minimum”
length that the Compton scale plays such a role, and that space time is like
Richardson’s delineation of a jagged coastline with a thick brush, the thick-
ness of the brush being comparable to the Compton scale.
Space time, rather than being a smooth continuum, is more like a fractal
Brownian curve. To analyse this further, we observe that space time given
by R and T of (1) and (2) represents a measure of dispersion in a normal
distribution. Indeed if we have a large collection of N events (or steps) of
length l or τ , forming a normal distribution, then the dispersion σ is given
by precisely the relation (1) or (2).
The signiﬁcance of this is brought out by the fact that the universe is a
collection of N elementary particles, infact typically pions of size l, as seen
above (Cf. ref.[21]). We consider space time not as an apriori container but
as a Gaussian collection of these particles. It is a Random Heap. At this
stage, we do not even need the concept of a continuum.

In this scheme the probability distribution has a width or dispersion
√N
(Cf. ref.[22]), that is the ﬂuctuation (or dispersion) in the number of parti-
√N. This immediately leads to equations (1) and (2). Moreover it

leads to a completely consistent cosmology as pointed out earlier[23] which
explains how all the so called Large Number coincidences and also Weinberg’s

(3)

far from being empirical, follow as a consequence of the theory, while pre-
dicting an ever expanding universe as is conﬁrmed by latest independent
observations.
It must be emphasized that equations (1) and (3) in particular bring out a
holistic or Machian feature in which the large scale universe and the micro
world are inextricably tied up, as against the usual diﬀerential view. This is
infact inescapable if we are to consider a Brownian Heap.

3 Stochastic Considerations

It was observed in Section 2 that the cut oﬀ length for fractal behaviour
depends on the mass, via the de Broglie or Compton wavelength. The de
Broglie wavelength is the non-relativistic version of the Compton wavelength.
Indeed it has been shown in detail[16, 24] that it is the Zitterbewegung or
self-interaction eﬀects within the minimum cut oﬀ Compton wavelength that
indeed give rise to the inertial mass. So the appearance of mass in the mini-
mum cut oﬀ Compton (or de Broglie) scale is quite natural.
With this background we observe that it has been pointed out by Nottale[13]
and others, though from a diﬀerent standpoint, that the fractal nature and
a stochastic underpinning are interrelated: for times less than the Compton
(or de Broglie) wavelength, time runs backwards, corresponding to Nelson’s
double Wiener process[25]. This leads to the complex wave function of Quan-
tum Mechanics.
This is also the Zitterbewegung within the Compton scales as discussed else-
where (Cf.ref.[16]).
Infact we have here a harmonious and meaningful convergence of Nelson’s
stochastic approach and the de Broglie-Bohm approach, if we recognize the
minimum space time cut oﬀs, which again as pointed out, have a Brownian
underpinning. This can be seen brieﬂy as follows.
Let us consider the motion of a particle with position given by x(t), subject
to random correction given by, as in the usual theory, (Cf.[25, 8]),

and being related to the mean free path by

We can then proceed to the Fokker-Planck equation.
In Nelson’s derivation, the Schrodinger wave function, exactly as in the de
Broglie-Bohm approach, is decomposed as (Cf. also[26])

As pointed out by Nottale[26], the complex feature above disappears if the
fractal or non-diﬀerential character is not present, (that is, the forward and
backward derivates are equal): Indeed the fractal dimension 2 leads to the
real coordinate becoming complex. What distinguishes Quantum Mechanics
is the adhoc feature, the diﬀusion constant ν of (4) in Nelson’s theory and
the ”Quantum potential” Q of (5).
However, once we recognize the minimum cut oﬀ space-time intervals, these
adhoc features become quite meaningful: Equation (4) gives us the Compton
wavelength and the Q of the equation (5), as described in reference[16] gives
the inertial mass and energy of ”quantized vortices” with the same Compton
scale extent.
The following will throw further insight on the foregoing considerations. Let
us start with the Langevin equation in the absense of external forces,

αv + F ′(t)

where the coeﬃcient of the frictional force is given by Stokes’s Law (cf.[27])

This then leads to two cases.
Case (i):
For t, there is a cut oﬀ time τ . This is so because

shows that the intertial mass is a type of viscosity of the background ZPF
reminiscent of the work of Rueda and Haisch[28] and similar to the Compton
wavelength mass referred to earlier (cf.also ref.[21]). To sum up case (i), for
a cut oﬀ τ , the stochastic form leads us back to the minimum space time
intervals
To push these small scale considerations further, we have, using the Becken-
stein radiation equation[29],

Compton scale.

which gives

In other words the Compton wavelength equals the Schwarzchild radius,
which automatically gives us the Planck mass.
On the other hand if we work with t

τ we get

which is the Hagedorn formula for Hadrons[30].
Thus both the Planck scale and the Compton wavelength Hadron scale con-
siderations follow meaningfully.
Case (ii):
If there is no cut oﬀ time τ , as is known, we get back,

and thence Nelson’s derivation of the non relativistic Schrodinger equation.

4 Space Time

As remarked in the previous section, the fact that forward and backward time
derivatives in the double Wiener process do not cancel leads to a complex
velocity (cf.[26]), V
ıU. That is, the usual space coordinate x (in one
dimension for simplicity) is replaced by a coordinate like x + ıx′, where x′
is a non constant function of time. We will now show that it is possible to
consistently take x′ = ct.
Let us take the simplest choice for x′, viz., x′ = λt. Then the imaginary part
of the complex velocity is given by U = λt. Then we have (cf.[26]),

−

where ν and ρ have been deﬁned in the equations leading to (4) and (5). We
thus have, ρ = eγx, where γ = λ/ν and the quantum potential of (5) is given
by

2
¯h
2m ·
We have already remarked in the previous section that in this stochastic for-
mulation with Compton wavelength cut oﬀ, Q turns out to be the inertial
energy mc2 (cf.[16]). It then follows from (6) that λ = c.
In other words it is in the above stochastic (and fractal) formulation that we
see the emergence of the space time coordinates (x, ıct). If we now generalise
to three spatial dimensions, then as is well known[31], we get the quarternion
formulation with the Pauli spin matrices giving the purely Quantum Mechan-
ical spin half of Dirac. On the other hand, the above fractal formulation with
minimum space time cut oﬀs has been shown to lead independently to the
Dirac equation[4] as remarked earlier. Thus the origin of special relativity,
inertial mass and the Quantum Mechanical spin half is the minimum space
time cut oﬀs. (Indeed it can be shown that a minimum space time cut oﬀ
leads to Special Relativity[8, 19].

5 Comments

(i) The fact that the Quantum Mechanical wave function is complex, which
indeed is one of the distinguishing features, is directly related to the above

7

minimum space time cut oﬀs and fractal considerations. We must also re-
memeber that the Quantum Mechanical wave function contains as much
information of the system under consideration as possible. The values of
the time derivative of the wave function cannot therefore appear as initial
conditions.
Interestingly it can be shown that this consideration together with the re-
quirement of causality demands that the wave function be complex[32]. If
the wave function were to be real, then it is well known that we have a sta-
tionary situation in the Quantum picture. In Classical Mechanics, in contrast
the dynamics is in the second time derivative, and both a quantity like the
position and its derivative, that is velocity or momentum are required for
initial conditions. That is why in Classical theory we do not require complex
quantities.
(ii) It may be mentioned, that the holistic feature is contained in (1) and
(3). In this spirit, starting from a universal set - for example the universe of
galaxies - and considering a cascade of subsets, it is possible to see the origin
of a metric (Cf.[33] for details), rather than start with particles and consider
larger and larger sets.
(iii) The considerations of Section 3 and Section 4 show how Nelson’s stochas-
tic formulation and the de Broglie-Bohm approach converge. Both these
approaches however have been non relativistic and have had some unsatis-
factory adhoc features. For example the diﬀusion constant which appears in
(4) or the non local Quantum potential which appears in (5). These features
however become meaningful once we take into account the Compton scale
cut oﬀ and the Zitterbewegung eﬀects, as described in the previous section.
It is also this stochastic or fractal feature which ensures that the underlying
theory has no hidden variables (Cf.refs.[13] and [20]).

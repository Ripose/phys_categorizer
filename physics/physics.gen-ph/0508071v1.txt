Abstract

Manuscript astro-ph/0504486 [1] is a clear example of the fundamental conceptual ﬂaw
that had persisted for the past 100 years. Namely, the failure to realize that mass-energy
equivalence, as applied to a propagating light particle (photon), is only a special case of a
more general law that encompasses both photons and subluminal particles.

This is a comment on manuscript astro-
ph/0504486 [1], which presents a very inter-
esting derivation of the famous equation E =
mc2. This paper, however, is a clear example
of the fundamental conceptual ﬂaw that had
persisted for the past 100 years. Namely, the
failure to realize that mass-energy equivalence,
as applied to a propagating light particle (pho-
ton), is only a special case of a more general
law that encompasses both photons and sub-
luminal particles. More speciﬁcally, the fact
that a propagating photon carries the equiva-
lent of a “mass” and that such equivalence is
described by the relationship E = mc2, does
not automatically imply that the relationship
is valid for particles of ordinary matter. Now,
how about the law of conservation of energy?
Without a doubt, the law of conservation of
energy is valid. The fundamental misconcep-
tion, however, is the following: while the quan-
tity E = mc2 describing the energy content in
a photon must be conserved, it does not math-
ematically take the same form when applied to
particles of ordinary matter. In other words,

the numerical value of the energy is conserved,
not its mathematical expression! For more
in-depth discussion of this fundamental issue,
the reader is referred to article [2] by the au-
thor, and the subsequent articles [3, 7]. As
is shown in those articles, the correct mass-
energy equivalence expression that is applica-
ble to subluminal particles is E = mv2, where
v is the particle’s velocity. If the particle emits
electromagnetic energy in the form of radia-
tion then the change in its total energy will
be given by ∆E = m1v2
2. The error in
derivations such as the one in [1] is the assump-
tion that the mass of the particle changes but
not its velocity! Since the velocity of light is
the limiting velocity, then for a particle travel-
ing with a velocity v ≈ c, the change in energy
will be given by ∆E ≈ ∆mc2. The famous
equation is hence a special case that applies
when a particle is moving with a velocity close
to c.

1 − m2v2

Attached to this fundamental issue is another
important issue, which is the ﬂawed assump-

1

tion that elementary (Dirac) particles decay
at rest (and of course the implications of this
assumption as far as the principle of Lorentz
invariance is concerned). As was discussed in
the earlier papers by the author, particles such
as neutrons, π±, etc. can decay at rest, since
those particles have structure within (very fast
moving quarks), and hence energy. This is
in agreement with the equation E = mv2
and does not violate Lorentz invariance. On
the other hand, muons cannot decay at rest,
since muons are Dirac particles.
It must be
noted that, to date, there has been no sin-
gle experiment that proves decisively whether
or not muons decay at rest. Even Leon Le-
derman had pointed out that his experiment
on parity violation [8] does not prove that
muons decay at rest, since muons can become
trapped within the internal magnetic ﬁelds of
the atoms and hence have a localized velocity
(even though the energy loss formulae suggest
that the muon has come to a stop). However,
if an experiment can show beyond any doubt
that the muon does indeed decay at rest, then
the muon cannot be a Dirac particle. It must
have structure!

We would like to point out that all of the
so-called “non-relativistic” derivations of E =
mc2 start with the theory of electromagnetism
(Poincar´e had in fact demonstrated -before
1905- that E = mc2 can be proved starting
from Maxwell’s equations [9]). If E = mc2 was
indeed a universal law of nature, we should be
able to prove it without invoking the theory
of electromagnetism.
I challenge the physics
community to show a proof for E = mc2 with-
out invoking the theory of electromagnetism.

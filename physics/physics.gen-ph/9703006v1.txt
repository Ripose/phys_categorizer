ABSTRACT
In the framework of linear transformations between inertial systems,
there are no physical reasons for assuming any anisotropy in the one-way
velocity of light.

Introduction

The anisotropy in the microwave background(1) has suggested the existence
of a preferred frame Σ which sees an isotropic background and of a corre-
spondent anisotropy in the one-way velocity of light, when measured in our
system S, which moves with respect to Σ at the velocity of about 377 Km/s.
This possibility has been exploited from the theoretical point of view(2,3);
many important and precise experiments have then been carried out with
the purpose of detecting this anisotropy. No variation was observed at the
level of 2 × 10−13 (4), 3 × 10−9 (5) and 2 × 10−15 (6).

We discuss here the generalized Lorentz transformations which have

stimulated these experiments.

2 Local inertial systems

The starting point of our discussion is the fact that the background radiation
intensity appears to be anisotropic to an observer O, at the origin of a
reference frame S in our ”region” of the universe R. It is quite reasonable
to suppose, as we do, that the universe mass distribution too is anisotropic
from the point of view of O, while it is seen isotropic by the observer Ω at
the origin of a preferred reference frame Σ. We suppose moreover that all

1

the reference frames we are speaking about are settled in accordance with
the following procedure:

a) the origins are attached to bodies, which are ”far enough” from other
celestial bodies and are well oriented with respect to identical very far ob-
jects;

b) identical conventional space and time standards are used in all the

reference systems.

The important point is that the absolute system Σ and the relative
frame S of our region of the universe appreciate diﬀerences in the radiation
background, but cannot ”locally” appreciate any force due to the diﬀerent
mass distribution. The ”region” R behaves like the world inside the Einstein
elevator; the Einstein equivalence principle ensures that, if Ω and O perform
identical experiments in their respective ”regions”, which are not inﬂuenced
by the presence of local masses (Earth, Sun, ...), they obtain identical results.
An immediate consequence is that the inertia principle is valid for all the
local inertial systems.

This concept is very clearly stated by Hans Reichenbach(7):
It can be shown within the framework of Newton’s theory that one can
obtain local inertial systems by transforming away the gravitational ﬁeld,
although these systems are in a diﬀerent state of motion provided that the
equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass is presupposed. The gravi-
tational ﬁeld, which as such is still present, is compensated in these local
systems by their acceleration relative to absolute space and the resulting in-
ertial forces. According to Einstein, however, only these local systems are
the actual inertial systems. In them the ﬁeld, which generally consists of
a gravitational and an inertial component, is transformed in such manner
that the gravitational component disappears and only the inertial component
remains. The astronomical inertial systems of Newton can at best be approx-
imations which gradually change in the neighborhood of stars. Only because
distances in space are large compared to the masses of the stars, and because
the stars have very low speeds, are astronomical inertial systems possible as
approximations.

The words ”far enough” used in a) express this approximation.

3 Linear transformations

If the transformations between these inertial systems are taken to be linear,
then the condition that any inertial motion is such for any local inertial sys-

2

tem is implicity satisﬁed. Many authors have added, to this hypothesis of
linearity, other hypotheses with the purpose of assuring consistency between
the measures of diﬀerent observers; many of them(8−23) have not postulated,
a priori, the invariance of the light speed. They conclude that these trans-
formations must be of Lorentz-type, characterized by a velocity c which,
in principle, may take diﬀerent absolute value in the diﬀerent astronomical
directions, but which is, for any ﬁxed astronomical direction, equal for all
the local inertial systems.

The consequences of the existence of a preferred reference frame Σ have
been extensively discussed by Mansouri and Sexl(2); in particular they an-
alyze the form the linear transformation from Σ to an other frame S must
take in order that the classical special relativity experiments could be ex-
plained, without introducing a priori the invariance of the speed of light.
Moreover they compare the Einstein and the transport syncronization pro-
cedure and derive the dependence of the one-way velocity of light on its
motion direction.

One of the most general transformations between the inertial systems
Σ and S, which relatively move along the x-direction which connects the
origins Ω and O, has been given by Robertson(4) in the form:

, y

= a2z,

(1)

′

where a0, a1 and a2 may depend on v. This transformation, which is ex-
pressed in terms of the parameter v and which reduces to the identity when
v = 0, is derived under the hypotheses that: i) space is euclidean for both Σ
and S which use identical rods and clocks; ii) in Σ all clocks are syncronized
and light moves with a speed c which is independent of direction and posi-
tion; iii) the one-way speed of light in S in the azymuth plane is direction
independent.

Notice that the relative velocity of S with respect to Σ is not given by
v, but is equal to ˜v ≡ va0/a1 ; analogously, the one-way velocity of light is
given by ˜c ≡ ca0/a1. In terms of these true velocities, equations (1) take
the form

′

t

(cid:19)

Moreover, the velocity ˜c is seen by S to take the value

′
˜c

=

a1(v)
a0(v)

˜c.

(4)

In other words, the one-way velocity of light scales as the relative velocity of
the two frames. As a consequence, if S and S′ are any two reference frames
which are moving (along the x-axis) with respect to Σ, they appreciate
diﬀerent relative velocities and diﬀerent same-way velocities of light which
are in the same ratio. It follows that, if the unit lenght of S is such a way
that O and Ω appreciate the same relative speed, then a0 = a1 and viceversa.
It is interesting to notice that, if the Robertson hypotheses are released
and one looks for the general one-dimensional linear transformations along
the x-axis between the preferred frame Σ and any S which satisﬁes the
condition that

-not only Σ and S appreciate the same relative speed but also any two
frames S and S′, uniformly moving at ﬁnite velocities with respect to Σ,
appreciate the same ﬁnite speed,

-then one fundamental velocity (which obviously must be identiﬁed with
the light speed) exists, the syncronization between two points of a frame is
in agreement with the Einstein rule and the transformations take the form
of the ﬁrst two of eqs. (2) with a0 = a1 (see references (6)-(20) and, in
particular, (21)).

The transformation (2) is simply the product of the scale transformation

which scales the four dimensions respectively by the factors

1 − ˜v2

1 − ˜v2

a0(˜v)

s

˜c2 , a1(˜v)

s

˜c2 , a2(˜v), a2(˜v)

(5)

by a standard Lorentz transformation.

The scale transformations, ﬁrst considered by Galilei in Discorsi sovra
due nuove Scienze, were carefully analyzed by J. Fourier, H. von Helmoltz
and in particular by H. Poincar´e, who reached the conclusion that a pure
spatial deformation of the universe has no physical consequences; moreover,
if the space and time coordinates of the universe are deformed in such man-
ner that all the space-time coincidences are conserved, then the universe
remains unchanged.(24)
If we consider the particular case of eqs. (2) in which ˜v = 0, we have

ds2 = dx

′2 + dy

′2 + dz

′2 = a2

1dx2 + a2

2dy2 + a2

2dz2.

This case is typical of a tetragonal crystal; the position of the second near-
est neighborhood is described in S by the numbers (1, 1, 0) and in S′ by the
components (a1, a2, 0). The distances remain the same. It is worthwhile to
notice that, in this case, if we scale the units of S′ in such a way that they
become equal, the times required by the light to travel the reticular dis-
tances in the diﬀerent directions remain unchanged, but the light velocities
are corresponding scaled; the anisotropy of the tetragonal crystal remains
untouched.

4 Conclusions

The general transformation (2) reduces to the Lorentz one if one requires
that Ω and O evaluate that the clock of the other observer is going slower
in the same ratio (or, equivalently, if each of them appreciate an identical
contraction for the reciprocal rods).

The eﬀect of the scale transformations (5) must be carefully analyzed.
For what concerns the lenghts in diﬀerent directions, if there is no way for
independent measures of lenghts and light velocities, in other words, if unit
lenghts are measured by ﬁxing the light velocity (or viceversa), there is no
way of controlling the change in lenght of a rod with the orientation . The
only thing to do is to use the Poincar´e simplicity criterion and consider
equal the lenghts of the rods and the one-way speeds of light in the diﬀerent
directions.

In conclusion, isotropy in the one-way speed of light is a matter of def-
inition and the experiments conducted by J. Hall and coworkers at very
soﬁsticated levels must be considered signiﬁcant improvements of some clas-
sical experiments in the frame of the special relativity.

There are however experiments which cannot be explained in the frame
of generalized linear Lorentz transformation; this is the case when the time
required by the light to cover a poligonal is not in the ratio with the time
required to cover the apotheme, which is provided by the Euclidean geom-
etry. Notice that the explanation is not found in supposing that the light
speed along the perimeter is diﬀerent from the one along the apotheme (on
the contrary, from the point of view of a local observer the velocity of a
photon along its trajectory is always c(25)), but in requiring that the space
structure is no more Euclidean.

Analogously, the experiments by Shapiro et al.(26) and Reasenberg et
al.(27) on the radar echo delay show that an e.m. wave travelling close to

5

the Sun appears not only deviated, but also slightly retarded to an observer
in a far ﬂat region. This phenomenon too cannot be explained by supposing
a delay for the light which comes from the Sun to the Earth, but must be
settled in the general relativity frame.

Abstract

In this contribution, the thermodynamics of black holes is treated
by the model of Expansive Nondecelerative Universe (ENU). Based on
entropy considerations and localization of gravitational energy, esti-
mation of both the lower and upper mass limits of black holes is given.
Both mass limits are time dependent.

Keywords: Black holes; Expansive Nondecelerative Universe; mass
limits; thermodynamics; quantum evaporation; gravity localization

1 Thermodynamics of black holes and a lower

limit of their mass

As part of his famous ideas concerning the existence and properties of black
holes, combining quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, Hawking [1] for-
mulated the following equation describing the quantum evaporation output
Pevap of a black hole with the gravitational radius rBH

Pevap =

¯h.c2
r2
BH

(1)

Hypothesis on the quantum evaporation of black holes has been developed by
several groups of theoreticians and ﬁeld researchers, no burst proving a fatal
cessation of either primordial or later formed black hole has been, however,

observed. The questions of minimum and maximum mass of black holes are
still under discussion and deserve attention. We are convinced that the model
of Expansive Nondecelerative Universe (ENU) [2-4] is capable to contribute
In this contribution its potential in
in oﬀering answers to such questions.
this ﬁeld is documented.

Due to the Vaidya metric application [5], ENU enables to localize and
quantify the energy of the gravitational ﬁeld. For weak ﬁeld conditions it
adopts the form

εg = −

R.c4
8π.G

= −

3m.c2
4π.a.r2

where εg is the density of gravitational ﬁeld energy generated by a body with
a mass m at a distance r, R is the scalar curvature and a is the gauge factor
(reaching at present a ∼= 1.3 × 1026m) [2].

It is worth mentioning that the magnitude of εg given by (2) is closed to
the θ0
0 component of the Einstein energy-momentum pseudotensor describing
the density of gravitational energy also for strong ﬁeld conditions [6]. As a
direct consequence of Vaidya metric application, R 6= 0 also outside a body.
In such a case the gravitational output Pg of a body at a given cosmological
time tc is as follows

Pg = −

dV = −

In order not to violate the second law of thermodynamics, it must hold

In a limiting case of the outputs being equal and taking into account that

a lower mass limit of a black hole can be expressed as

that leads to its current value

The value given by eq. (7) can be obtained by an independent mode, based
on the entropy consideration, too.

mBH
mSun (cid:19)

(cid:18)

where k is the Boltzmann constant, lP c is the Planck length, and mSun is the
current mass of our Sun. The second law of thermodynamics stipulates that
for the irreversible processes (creation of a black hole may set as an example of
such processes), the initial state (e.g., star) entropy must be lower than that
of the ﬁnal state (black hole). Suppose, a black hole creation is a consequence
of gravitational collapse of a star with the mass mStar. The entropy value
of the magnitude of Boltzmann constant may be allocated to each degree of
freedom of a classical system of particles (for the sake of simplicity, nucleons
are considered). For the entropy of the initial system it must, therefore, hold

S ∼= k.

mStar
mn

∼= k.1057 mStar
mSun

where mn is the mass of nucleon (usually the proton mass).

Comparing (8) and (9) it can be seen that the process of a collapse accom-
panied by a black hole creation is associated with an increase in entropy by
19 orders of magnitude and it is, therefore, of a strongly irreversible nature.
It follows further from comparison of (8) and (9) that reducing the initial
mass mStar, the entropy of a corresponding black hole will drop by a higher
extent than that of initial star. Both the value become equal at

mStar

∼= 1012kg

(10)

It means that at the time being no black holes with a lower mass can be
created (and probably no such a black hole can exist). Otherwise the entropy
of a black hole would be lower than that of the collapsing star, i.e. the second
law of thermodynamics would be violated.

It is worth mentioning that relations (7) and (10) have been obtained in

independent ways.

In addition to the lowest mass limit, using (6) the gravitational radius of

such a black hole, rBH(min) can be calculated

2 The lowest mass of particles exerting grav-

itational inﬂuence

Gravitational force is a far-reaching force with ostensibly unlimited range.
Due to the existence of hierarchic rotational gravitational systems, the range
is, however, actually ﬁnite. This is a reason for introducing so called “ef-
fective gravitational range” ref , i.e.
the distance at which the density of
gravitational ﬁeld of a given body is equal to the critical density of back-
ground gravitational ﬁeld. Critical energy density is in ENU equal to the
actual mean energy density, it decreases in time and is given [2] by

It follows from (2) and (13) that (in absolute values)

εcrit =

3c4
8π.G.a2

3c4
8π.G.a2 =

3m.c2
4π.a.r2

and, in turn

ref = (rg.a)1/2
(15)
where ref is the eﬀective gravitational range of a body with the gravitational
radius rg.

Based on the above rationalization, it is possible to determine the lightest
particle able to exerts gravitational inﬂuence on its surroundings. The parti-
cle has the mass mx and its gravitational range is identical to its Compton’s
wavelength. Stemming from the following relation

the current mass of the particle is

(cid:17)

As follows from (12), it is at the same time also a lower mass limit of a black
hole. Turning back to entropy considerations, it is obvious that relation (9)
should be modiﬁed as follows

(13)

(14)

S ∼= k.

In such a way, relations (6), (7), (9), and (10) become consistent since the
entropy in (9) will be time-dependent. Stemming from (15), an increase
of the gravitational range of nucleons in time is an expected phenomenon.
Similarly, the degree of freedom and entropy of the system will increase too.
It should be pointed out that at the beginning of the matter era it had to
hold

mx

∼= mn

(20)

It means that nucleons started to exert their gravitational inﬂuence to the
environment just at the beginning of the matter era which, inter alia, allowed
black holes to be formed. Stemming from the equality of (8) and (19), it is
possible to obtain relations (6) and (10).

3 Upper mass limit of black holes

Contrary to all the time present gravitational quanta, there were no elemen-
tary particles present the at the beginning of the Universe expansion. This is
why it is useful to express the total entropy of the Universe, SU by a number
of gravitational quanta [8] as follows

where mU is the Universe mass and Eg is the mean energy of the gravitational
ﬁeld quantum. The wavefunction of the mean gravitational quantum of the
Universe is given by [8]

where tP c is the Planck time. Relation (22) complies with a Schr¨odinger-like
equation for the energy of gravitational quanta Eg

and it comes from (22) and (23) that

SU =

Based on (21) and (24) for the total entropy of the Universe it follows

No body, black holes including, can possess an entropy content higher than
that of the whole Universe. This is the reason due to which using (8) and
(25) it must hold

In (26), rBH(max) is the maximum gravitational radius of a black hole in the
Universe with the gauge factor a. It can be directly obtained from (26) that

(cid:17)

rBH(max)

∼= 1011m

which currently approaches to

The maximum mass of black holes, corresponding to (28) is then

mBH(max)

∼= 1038kg ∼= 108mSun

which is in excellent agreement with experimental observation [9].

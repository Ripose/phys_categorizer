Quantum Force in Superconductor

Moscow District, RUSSIA

In order to conciliate a contradiction of the Little-Parks experiment with the Ohm’s law and other
fundamental laws the thermal ﬂuctuation is considered as dynamic phenomenon and a new force
called ”quantum force” is introduced. A persistent current can exist at zero voltage and non-
zero resistance because of the quantum force induced by the thermal ﬂuctuation. Not only the
persistent current but also a persistent voltage (a direct voltage in the equilibrium state) can exist
in an inhomogeneous superconducting ring. Directions of the persistent current and the persistent
voltage coincide in a ring segment with lower critical temperature and are opposite in other ring
segment with higher Tc. Consideration of a superconducting ring interrupted by Josephson junction
shows a connection of the quantum force with a real mechanical force.

Superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phe-
nomenon: some macroscopic eﬀects observed in super-
conductors can not be described by classical mechanics.
One of them is the Little-Parks (LP) experiment [1] re-
peated in numerous works (see for example [2]).
It is
considered [3,2] that the LP experiment was explained
as long ago, as 1963 [4]. But this explanation is not per-
fect. More perfect consideration shows a contradiction
of the LP experiment in a loop [2] with some habitual
knowledge. This contradiction is explained in the present
work.

The resistance oscillations observed at the LP exper-
iment is interpreted as a consequence of oscillations of
the superconducting transition temperature Tc [1,3,2]. It
is assumed [3] that Rl(T ) = Rl(T − Tc) in the resistive
l dlρ/s [2]
transition region where the resistance Rl =
changes from Rl = Rln to Rl = 0. Here Rln is the resis-
tance along the loop in the normal state; s is the area of
the cross-sectional of the wire deﬁning the loop.

R

The Tc oscillations is explained by the ﬂuxoid quanti-
zation [4,3,2]. Because of the quantization the velocity

of superconducting pairs can not be equal zero when the
magnetic ﬂux Φ contained within a loop is not divisible
by the ﬂux quantum Φ0 = π¯hc/e. Therefore the energy of
superconducting state increases and as consequence the
Tc decreases when Φ 6= nΦ0, ∆Tc ∝ −v2
s ∝ −(n−Φ/Φ0)2
[3]. The magnetic ﬂux LIs induced by the screening cur-
rent Is = sjs = s2ensvs is small LIs ≪ Φ0 at T ≃ Tc
(when the density of superconducting pairs ns is close to
zero) and therefore Φ = BS + LIs ≃ BS [3]. Here B is
the magnetic induction induced by an external magnet;
S is the area of the loop.

It is important that the theoretical dependence ∆Tc ∝
s ∝ (n − Φ/Φ0)2 has minimum
−(n − Φ/Φ0)2, where v2
possible value [3] describes enough well the experimental
data (see for example Fig.4 in [2]). Consequently, super-
conducting states with minimum (n − Φ/Φ0)2 value give

is not equal zero at Φ 6= nΦ0 and Φ 6= (n+0.5)Φ0. vs = 0
at Φ = (n + 0.5)Φ0 because the permitted states with op-
posite direction of the velocity have the same v2
s value.
vs ≈ (π¯h/ml)(n − Φ/Φ0) in a homogeneous loop when Φ
is not close to (n + 0.5)Φ0.

Thus, according to the LP experiment and in spite of
l dlE = −(1/c)dΦ/dt a direct
the Ohm’s law RlIsc =

screening current Isc ≈ s2ens(π¯h/ml)(n − Φ/Φ0) ﬂows
along the loop at a constant magnetic ﬂux, Φ 6= nΦ0
and Φ 6= (n + 0.5)Φ0, and Rl 6= 0. The later is evident
from the experiment [2]. The measured resistance [2]
Rm ≈ Rl/4 in a homogeneous loop. The LP experiment
contradicts not only to the Ohm’s law but also some more
fundamental laws because a dissipation (friction) force
Fdis should act at Isc = sjsc 6= 0 and Rl 6= 0, and an
energy dissipation with power RlI 2

is used because the js value
should be constant along the loop in the stationary state.
( ns ought be considered as an eﬀective density in or-
der to take into account the Josephson current through
segments with ns = 0). Therefore the LP oscillations
are observed only in the region of the resistive tran-
sition where loop segments are switched by the ther-
mal ﬂuctuation between superconducting state (when
s >−16= 0, js 6= 0 but Rl = 0) and normal state
< n−1
(when < n−1
s >−1= 0, Rl 6= 0 but js = 0). These oscilla-
tions can not be observed below the resistive transition
where js 6= 0 but Rl = 0 all time and above this transi-
tion where Rl = Rln but js = 0 all time.

Thus, the LP experiment is evidence of a motion in-
duced by ﬂuctuation in the thermodynamic equilibrium

state at non-zero dissipation. Such phenomena are called
Brownian motion [5]. There is an important diﬀerence
from the classical Brownian motion. According to the
classical mechanics the average velocity of any Brownian
motion should be equal zero whereas the LP experiment
is evidence of the persistent current (i.e. a direct current
in the equilibrium state) jp.c. = jsc 6= 0 at Φ 6= nΦ0 and
Φ 6= (n + 0.5)Φ0.

Therefore, according to the classical mechanics any direct
(non-chaotic) current can be only in a nonequilibrium
state and it is postulated that the average value of the
ﬂuctuation force introduced by Langevin for description
of the classical Brownian motion is equal zero FLan = 0.

Consequently, in the region of the resistive transition

At the closing of the superconducting state in the
loop, as well as at the Meissner eﬀect, superconducting
pairs are accelerated against the force of the electric ﬁeld
l dlE = −(1/c)dΦ/dt. In order to eliminate the contra-
diction with the Newton’s law a force Fq may be intro-
R
duced, Fq = ∆P ω. Because the ∆P is induced by quan-
tization it is natural to call Fq as quantum force. The
necessity to introduce the Fq is conditioned by the well
known diﬀerence between superconductor and a classical
conductor with inﬁnite conductivity. It is important that
the quantum force can not be localized in any segment of
the loop in principle because of the uncertainty relation
∆p∆l > ¯h. The vs becomes non-zero when the momen-
tum takes a certain value, ∆p ≪ pn+1 − pn = 2π¯h/l, i.e.
when superconducting pairs can not be localized in any
segment of the loop. Fq should be uniform along the loop
because ∆P ∝ js.

The quantum force Fq takes the place of the Faraday’s
voltage −(1/c)dΦ/dt which maintains the screening cur-
rent in a conventional loop with Rl 6= 0. Therefore the
jp.c. = jsc 6= 0 is observed at Rl 6= 0 and dΦ/dt in the
LP experiment. The periodic variation of the resistance
with magnetic ﬁeld Rl(Φ/Φ0) is observed in the LP ex-

periment [2] because the probability of superconducting
state P (< n−1
s >−16= 0) ∝ exp −(Ep + EL)/kBT de-
creases at Φ 6= nΦ0. The approximation [3], in which
only state with minimum |n−Φ/Φ0| is taken into account,
describes enough well the experimental data [2] because
in the superconducting state |Ep(n + 1) − Ep(n)| ≫ kBT
even in the ﬂuctuation region near Tc.

Thus, the LP experiment is evidence of a direct (non-
chaotic) one-dimensional Brownian motion. The Brown-
ian particle in this case is the superconducting conden-
sate. Its kinetic energy changes randomly in time: the Ep
(and also EL) is increased by the quantum force and dis-
sipates after the switching a loop segment in the normal
state. The quantum force induced by the ﬂuctuations
is the Langevin force FLan. Contrary to the classical

Because the LP experiment is explained by the ﬂuctu-

distribution function fcl is in the equilibrium f0 = fcl
p vfqu 6= 0 where fqu is in the

the motion along the loop both superconducting pairs
and electrons at the transition between fcl and fqu. The
reduction of jsc at Rl 6= 0 can be described by the classi-

voltage Vp.v. = < Vb > can be induced by ﬂuctuations
in an inhomogeneous loop. This result was published
ﬁrst in [10]. The possibility of the persistent voltage is
a direct consequence of the existence of the non-chaotic
Brownian motion at which FLan = Fq 6= 0. The aver-
age force of the electric ﬁeld Fe = enqE should be not
equal zero in an inhomogeneous loop, in which the dissi-
pation force Fdis has diﬀerent value in segments, because
Fq should be uniform along the loop and according to (6)
Fe ≃ Fq − Fdis (because Fp ≪ Fe). In a homogeneous
loop Fe = Fq − Fdis = 0 because the switching probabil-
ity of any segment is the same and Fdis is uniform along
the loop.

The inhomogeneous superconducting loop with Vp.v. 6=
0 is an electric circuit in which the la segment with higher
Tc is a power source, Ws = < Va > Isc < 0, and the lb
segment with lower Tc is a load, Wl = < Vb > Isc > 0.
The power Ws induced by the thermal ﬂuctuation can
not exceed (kBT )2/¯h because the energy of ﬂuctuation
is kBT and the frequency of switching ω < kBT /¯h
in accordance with the uncertainty relation. Conse-
quently Vp.v. = (RbWl)0.5 < kBTc(Rb/¯h)0.5 in any case.
(kBT )2/¯h ≃ 10−10 W t at T = 10 K and (kBT )2/¯h ≃
10−8 W t at T = 100 K. Therefore, at a real value
Rb = 1 Ω, Vp.v. < 10−5 V = 10 µV for a low Tc super-
conductor with Tc ≈ 10K and Vp.v. < 10−4 V = 100 µV
for a high Tc superconductor with Tc ≈ 100K. These
voltage values are large enough to be measured experi-
mentally.

The persistent voltage can be induced also in an inho-
mogeneous normal metal mesoscopic loop [11] in which
the persistent current can exist [6,7]. The mesoscopic
loop, in which electrons are scattered in only segment, is
like the inhomogeneous superconducting loop considered
above. Superconducting condensate can be considered
as a big particle which is scattered on the normal loop
segment like electrons are scattered on impurities. In de-
tails the problem of the persistent voltage in an inhomo-
geneous normal metal mesoscopic loop will be considered
elsewhere.

The transition between fcl and fqu states can be in-
duced not only by the ﬂuctuation but also by tempera-
ture change and by mechanical interrupting and closing
of the superconducting loop. In the ﬁrst case the loop
can be considered as dc generator in which heat energy
is transformed in electric energy [12]. In the second case
the mechanical energy is transformed to the electric en-
ergy. In order to close the loop interrupted by Joseph-
son junction, an additional work
dbFq = ∆b < Fq >
should be expended because the energy is increased on
Ep + EL ≈ Ep ≈ (s/λ2)(Φ2
0/4πR)(n − Φ/Φ0)2 at the Isc
appearance. The Josephson current decreases exponen-
tially with increasing of break width b and has a negli-
gible value when b exceeds some nanometers [13]. Con-
sequently in order to close the loop at n − Φ/Φ0 = 1/2
the quantum force, the average value of which equals
Fq ≈ (s/λ2)(Φ2
0/2l∆b)0.25, should be overcome, where

Abstract

A reconciliation of gravitation and electromagnetism has eluded
physics for neearly a century. It is argued here that this is because
both quantum physics and classical physics are set in diﬀerentiable
space time manifolds with point particles. Once we consider extended
particles as in Quantum Superstring theory, and the consequential un-
derlying Non-Commutative geometry, then a reconciliation is possible.

1 Introduction

Despite nearly a century of work, it has not been possible to achieve a uni-
ﬁcation of gravitation and electromagnetism. It must be borne in mind that
the tools used, be it Quantum Theory or General Relativity are deeply en-
trenched in diﬀerentiable space time manifolds (and point particles) - the
former with Minkowski space time and the latter with curved space time.
The challenge has been, as Wheeler noted[1], the introduction of Quantum
Mechanical spin half into General Relativity on the one hand and the intro-
duction of curvature into Quantum Mechanics on the other.
More recent models including Quantum Superstrings on the contrary deal
with extended and not point particles and lead to a non commutative geom-
etry (NCG)[2, 3, 4, 5]. Indeed this type of non commutativity arises if there
is a minimum space time length as shown a long time ago by Snyder[6]. What
we will argue below is that once the underlying non commutative nature of

1

the geometry is recognized then it is possible to reconcile electromagnetism
and gravitation.

2 NCG of Extended Particles

It is well known that once we consider non zero minimum space time intervals
or equivalently extended particles as in Quantum Superstrings, then we have
the following non commutative geometry (Cf.refs.[2]-[6]):

[x, y] = 0(l2), [px, py] ≈ ¯h20(1)

l2

(and similar equations) where l, τ are the extensions of the space time coor-
dinates.
In conventional theory the space time coordinates as also the momenta com-
mute amongst themselves unlike in equation (1). It must be observed that
the non commutative relations are self evident, in the sense that xy or yx is
each of the order of l2, and so is their diﬀerence because of the non commu-
tativity.
Let us now introduce this eﬀect into the usual distance formula in ﬂat space

Rewriting the product of the two coordinate diﬀerential in (2) in terms of
the symmetric and non symmetric combinations, we get

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν

gµν = ηµν + khµν

(1)

(2)

(3)

where the ﬁrst term on the right side of (3) denotes the usual ﬂat space time
and the second term denotes the eﬀect of the non commutativity, k being a
suitable constant.
It must be noted that if l, τ → 0 then equations (1) and also (3) reduce to
the usual formulation.
The eﬀect of the non commutative geometry is therefore to introduce a de-
parture from ﬂat space time, as can be seen from (3).
Infact remembering that the second term of the right side of (3) is small,
this can straightaway be seen to lead to a linearized theory of General

2

Relativity[7]. Exactly as in this reference we could now deduce the Gen-
eral Relativistic relation

∂λ∂λhµν − (∂λ∂νhµλ + ∂λ∂µhνλ)

− ηµν∂λ∂λh + ηµν∂λ∂σhλσ = −kT µν

Let us now consider the non commutative relation (1) for the momentum
components. Then, it can be shown using (1) and (3) that[8],

∂
∂xλ

∂
∂xµ

− ∂
∂xµ

∂
∂xλ

goes over

to

∂
∂xλ Γν

µν

− ∂

∂xµ Γν

λν

Normally in conventional theory the right side of (5) would vanish. Let us
designate this nonvanishing part on the right by

(6) can be written as

e
c¯h

F µλ

Bl2 ∼ ¯hc
e

where B is the magnetic ﬁeld, if we are to identify F µν with the electromag-
netic tensor[8]. It will be recognized that (7) gives the celebrated expression
for the magnetic monopole, and indeed it has also being shown that a non
commutative space time at the extreme scale throws up the monopole[9, 10].
We have shown here that the non commutativity in momentum components
leads to an eﬀect that can be identiﬁed with electromagnetism and infact
from expression (6) we have

Aµ = ¯hΓµν
ν

where Aµ is the electromagnetic four potential.
Thus non commutativity as expressed in equations (1) generates both grav-
itation and electromagnetism.

3 Discussion

1. It must be noted that equation (8) for the electromagnetic vector poten-
tial is mathematically identical to the formulation of Weyl[11]. However in
Weyl’s formulation, the electromagnetic potential was put in by hand. In the

(8)

above case it is a consequeence of the non commutative geometry at small
scales, which again is symptomatic of the spinorial behaviour of the electron,
as has been discussed in detail elsewhere[5, 8].
On the other hand the characterization of the metric in equations (2) and
(3) in terms of symmetric and non symmetric components is similar to the
tortional formulation of General Relativity[12]. However in this latter case,
there is no contribution to the diﬀerential interval from the tortional (that
is non-commutative) eﬀects. The non-commutative contribution is given by
(1) and herein comes the extended, rather than point like particle.
In any case the above attempts at uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and grav-
itation had made part headway, but unless the underpinning of a non com-
mutative geometry is recognised, the full signiﬁcance does not manifest itself.
It is also well known that, if equation (8) holds, then in the absence of matter,
the general relativisitc ﬁeld equations (4) reduce to Maxwell’s equations[13].
2. We now make the following remarks:
It can be seen from the transition to (3) from (2), that the curvature arises
from the non commutativity of the coordinates. Indeed this is the classical
analogue of a Quantum Mechanical result deduced earlier that the origin
of mass is in the minimum space intervals and the non local Quantum Me-
chanical amplitudes within them as has been discussed in detail in references
cited[14, 15]. In Quantum Superstring theory also, the mass arises out of the
tension of the string in this minimum interval. We see here the convergence
of the Quantum Mechanical and classical approaches once the extension of
particles is recognized.
We also know the the minimum space time intervals are at the Compton
scale where the momentum p equals mc. For a Planck mass ∼ 10−5gms, this
is also the Planck scale, as in Quantum Superstring theory.
In Snyder’s original work, the commutation relations like (1) hold good out-
side the minimum space time intervals, and are Lorentz invariant. This is
quite pleasing because in any case, even in Quantum Field Theory, we use
Minkowski space time.

4 Appendix

We start with the eﬀect of an inﬁnitessimal parallel displacement of a vector[13].

δaσ = −Γσ

As is well known, (A1) represents the extra eﬀect in displacements, due to the
curvature of space - in a ﬂat space, the right side would vanish. Considering
partial derivatives with respect to the µth coordinate, this would mean that,
due to (A1)

∂aσ
∂xµ

→ ∂aσ
∂xµ

− Γσ

µνaν

(A2)

where the Γs are the Christoﬀel symbols. The second term on the right side
of (A2) can be written as:

where we have utilized the linearity property that in the above formulation

−Γλ

µνgν

λaσ = −Γν

µνaσ

gµν = ηµν + hµν,

ηµν being the Minkowski metric and hµν a small correction whose square is
neglected.
That is, (A2) becomes,

∂
∂xµ

→ ∂
∂xµ

− Γν

(A3)

∂

∂
∂xµ

− ∂

→ ∂

− ∂

∂xµ Γv

λv

From (A3) we get

as required.

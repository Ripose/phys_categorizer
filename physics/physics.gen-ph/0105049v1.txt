dimensions of transﬁnite heterotic string space-time

Abstract

It is shown that the two sequences of characteristic dimensions of transﬁnite heterotic string space-time found by El
Naschie can be remarkably well accounted for in terms of the arithmetic of self-conjugate homaloidal nets of plane algebraic
curves of orders 3 to 20. A ﬁrm algebraic geometrical justiﬁcation is thus given not only for all the relevant dimensions of
the classical theory, but also for other two dimensions proposed by El Naschie, viz. the inverse of quantum gravity coupling
constant (≃ 42.36067977) and that of (one half of) ﬁne structure constant (≃ 68.54101967). A non-trivial coupling between
the two El Naschie sequences is also revealed.

1. Introduction

In a recent series of papers [1–9], El Naschie has demonstrated that the transﬁnitely-extended

heterotic string space-time exhibits two unique sequences of fractal dimensions

where k = φ3 (1
0.18033989. For k = 0 the second sequence is formally recognized to
encompass all the relevant dimensions of the classical heterotic string theory [10]. Soon after we
had become familiar with El Naschie’s work, we noticed that the sequence in question bears, for
q = 2, 3, . . . , 6, an extraordinary close resemblance to the sequence of the number of lines lying
on (ordinary) Del Pezzo surfaces [11,12]. Motivated by this observation, we raised a question
whether there exists an algebro-geometrical structure that would, at least partially, reproduce
both the above-introduced sequences. And such a structure was, indeed, found. It is associated
with the concept of plane Cremona transformations and, as we will see in what follows, it oﬀers
a nice ﬁt to both El Naschie’s sets simultaneously.

2. Plane Cremona transformations and self-conjugate homaloidal nets

1

A plane Cremona transformation [13] is a birational correspondence between the points of two
projective planes P2 and P ′
2, being generated, in either plane, by a speciﬁc family of algebraic
curves. This family possesses three characteristic properties [13,14]: 1) it is linear and doubly-
inﬁnite (the so-called net); 2) any two distinct curves of it have one and only one free intersection,
i.e. the intersection which is diﬀerent from any base (i.e. shared by all the members of the family)
point; and 3) all the curves are rational, i.e. birationally transformable into lines. A net of curves
meeting these three constraints is called homaloidal. For curves of any given order n, these
homaloidal nets are uniquely characterized by the total number and multiplicities of their base
points. The order of a Cremona transformation is the order n of the curves of its generating

3. Arithmetic of self-conjugate nets and El Naschie’s sequences

Our next attention is exclusively focussed on how the total number of self-conjugate homaloidal
n , depends on the value of n. For the ﬁrst 21 orders this relation was

There are several implications of serious physical importance that the above-described ﬁndings
impart on us. The ﬁrst one is the fact that both El Naschie’s hierarchies of fractal dimensions
should be treated on the same par, i.e. both should be regarded as equally relevant in describing
the structure of transﬁnite heterotic string space-time. This is simply a result of the common
origin of both the “homaloidal” sequences, embodied in the arithmetic of the set #sc
20.
The second fact is related to the value of D(3)
l=5 = 43. This dimension is obviously an integer-
valued match of DB
42.36067977, which is regarded by El Naschie [9] to be
identical with the smallest possible value of the inverse of quantum gravity coupling constant
¯αg in the non-supersymmetric case; our second “homaloidal” sequence thus gives a ﬁrst explicit,
algebraic geometrical justiﬁcation of the relevance of ¯αg for heterotic strings, as envisaged and
kept enthusiastically emphasized by El Naschie [1–9]. Third, it should not go unnoticed that
D(3)
l=6 = 69 gives equal relevance to the last, and highest, dimension in the series, viz. DB
q=0 =
68 + 3k
68.54101967. As the double of the latter value is thought to be very close to the inverse
value of the ﬁne structure constant [2], our ﬁndings also justify the prominent role this constant is
supposed to play, as already recognized by El Naschie [16], in all fundamental theories of stringy
(∞) as well. The ﬁnal outcome of our analysis that deserves to
space-times and Cantorian space
be properly underlined is the coupling between the two El Naschie fractal sequences. Here it is
important to realize that DB
q , as Eqs. (1) and (2) would seem
to imply, but – as it can easily be discerned from comparison of the last table with the ﬁrst one
– rather to DA
q can be viewed as twin/paired dimensions. Out of these, we
are then naturally led to form new sequences, the simplest ones being, of course, those obtained
by subtracting and adding the counterparts. While the ﬁrst operation brings up nothing new, as

and, interestingly, they are found to copy very closely the recently discovered by C. Castro
(hierarchy of) fractal dimensions generated by transﬁnite M-theory [17].

4. Summarizing conclusion

1This is perhaps most intriguing and unexpected observation in the present paper, which may well turn out to provide us with

invaluable clues for a further development of the theory of heterotic string space-time in its transﬁnite generalization.

Employing the algebra and arithmetic of self-conjugate homaloidal nets of planar algebraic
curves, we have discovered a couple of integer-valued progressions that are found to mimic ex-
traordinary well the two El Naschie sequences of fractal dimensions characterizing transﬁnite
heterotic string space-time. One of the progressions is demonstrated to provide an algebraic geo-
metrical justiﬁcation not only for all the relevant dimensions of the classical theory, but also for
other two dimensions advocated by El Naschie, namely the smallest value of the inverse of non-
42.36067977, and the inverse
supersymmetric quantum gravity coupling constant, ¯αg = 42 + k
of ﬁne structure constant, ¯α0 = 2
68.54101967. In addition, our “homaloidal”

arguments elucidate how the two El Naschie sequences are coupled to each other and imply the
existence of a third “fundamental” fractal sequence, which bears an intriguing similarity to the
hierarchy of fractal dimensions emerging from a transﬁnite extension of the M-theory.

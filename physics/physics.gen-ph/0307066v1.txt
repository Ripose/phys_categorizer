It is shown here that new experiments conﬁrm author’s recent prediction
of a strong tendency for triton clustering in light neutron rich nuclei. As
such the neutron halo phenomena is naturally explained here. Prediction
of exotic molecular states rich in tritonic clusters is made here through new
Ikeda-like diagram conﬁgurations for the nuclei 3Z
Z A2Z . Hence this model is
well conﬁrmed experimentally and makes several new predictions which can
be tested experimentally.

Abstract

1

Clustering , in particular that of α, has been a persistent aspect of nucler
structure and reaction studies [1]. So much so that some have speculated
of the existence of α - matter in contrast to nuclear matter. Hence it is
commonly believed that multi-α structures of various geometry should be
present in nuclei [2]. In fact even linear α chains are expected to occur too
[3,4,5]. Even when the neutron number increases drastically ( as it happens
in the case of neutron rich light nuclei ) the α structure is believed to persist
[1,2]. This is the standard picture of neutron rich nuclei accepted today.

However it may very well be that as neutron number increaes away from
the line of nuclear stability, some new structures may start manifesting them-
selves. Indeed a new model arising from Quantum Chromodyanamics (QCD)
and quark model considerations shows that this actually should be happening
[6]. Therein the author has recently predicted that triton clustering rather
than α clustering should be the dominant aspect of the structure of neutron
rich nuclei [6]. In this paper here, experimental evidences shall be presented
to support this view of triton clustering in neutron rich nuclei. In addition
Ikeda - like diagrams with triton rich linear structures ( which can be tested
experimenatlly ) shall also be presented. One interesting case where one such
prediction has already been conﬁrmed shall be discussed.

Ideas based on QCD and quark model allow us to see a common thread
in such diverse nuclear phenomenon as [6]: 1. The hole at the centre of
the density distribution in 3H, 3He and 4He, 2. The halo phenomena is
neutron rich nuclei, 3. The formation and persistence of clusters in nuclei
and 4. The nuclear molecule eﬀects. It turns out that all these require an
understanding of two or more nucleons strongly overlapping over a small local
region of size ≤ 1f m. This necessarily requires considerations of multi-quark
conﬁgurations like 6-, 9- and 12-quarks. It was shown by the author [6,7,8]
that the nucleons do not like to go into these conﬁgurations and thereby
the above mentioned nuclear eﬀects are given a consistent explanation. The
reader may refer to [6,7,8] for further details.

For our purpose here, note the eﬀect of triton clustering for neutron rich
nuclei predicted in this model [6].
It was shown that as more and more
neutrons are added to light nuclei there is a marked eﬀect that an α plus two
neutrons prefer to go to a conﬁguration of two tritons. There is a continuous
competition between an α cluster plus two neutrons remaining as such versus
these changing into two clusters of tritons. For a single such conﬁguration
in 6He this breakup does not happen and to a very good approximatioon

6He remains an α plus two neutrons for the ground state and low energy
excitations. This has important consequences like forming a halo [9,10] and
thus providing us with a better insight into the structure of other A=6 nuclei
like 6Li and 6Be [11]. The eﬀect of triton clustering also helps us to explain
the phenomenoa of neutron halos [6].

In our model for example, 12Be rather being treated as consisting of 2α
+ 4n conﬁguration ( as done by others [1,2] ) is treated as made up of 4t
( note that ’t’ stands for triton ) [6]. As such it forms a compact core and
when two more neutrons are added to it they are consigned to stay outside
the surface of the core and thereby forming a halo for 14Be. It is clustering
of either only tritons or with tritons and α that one gets a compact core, like
10Be froms a core of α + 2t to give 11Be a one neutron halo structure [6].

18C is made up of 6t and then 19C forms a one neutron halo around this
core. 17B is two neutron halo nucleus with a core of 15B made up of 5t. This
structure is indeed so stable that it can accept four more neutrons attached
to its surface to form 19B.

There have been claims that inspite of higher values for one neutron
and two neutron separation energies for 15C and 16C respectively, these are
In our model 14C forms a
actually one and two neutron halo nuclei [12].
compact core of the structure 2α + 2t. Our model also makes a unique
prediction that this nucleus should have marked depression at the centre
in its matter distribution and also therefore have a pronounced excess of
matter concentration on the surface [6]. (It is hoped that with the currently
proposed lepton-RIB colliders it should be possible to obtain charge density
distribution of these radioacutive nuclei in the near future). Thereby the
extra neutrona in 15C and 16C would not be able to penetrate through the
surface as that would entail 6-,9- or 12-quark conﬁgurations locally and as
this is suppressed due to QCD and quark model considerations, these extra
neutrons form a halo around this core of 14C.

As per this model 21N would consist of 7t and form a good core. Then
22N and 23N would appear as one-neutron and two-neutron halo nuclei re-
spectively - exacly as seen in the experiments [9]. For the Oxygen case 24O
is made up of 8t and in our model this should be extra stable. Interestingly
this is what has been found experimentally [9]. Note that in our model 22O
has structure α + 6t. The number of clusters here are the same as in the
very stable 7t structure of 21N as indicated above. Hence this nucleus could
also be very stable. Thus as one or two neutrons are added to it, it may show

3

them as halo nuclei. Thus both 23O and 24O would appear as halo nuclei
[9]. This interesting situation calls for further study. However, ﬁrst it has to
be clearly understood whether it is a real halo eﬀect we are seeing or a very
thick neutron skin.

It was suggested by Ikeda [13] that cluster like conﬁgurations would ap-
pear in light A=4n self conjugate nuclei near the threshold energy for breakup
into proper sub-nuclei. The corresponding Ikeda diagrams gave visual pic-
tures of relevant structures [1,2]. Note that this necessarily involved clusters
of α particles.

In our model here as triton clustering appears to be such a dominant
eﬀect for neutron rich nuclei [6], then quite clearly we should expect that for
nuclei 3Z
Z A2Z similar triton rich cluster structures would exist. Therfore con-
ﬁgurations with neutron rich nuclei would appear near the threshold energy
for decay into corresponding relevant sub-nuclei. These Ikeda - like diagrams
are here given in Figure 1. So as not to clutter the ﬁgure not all the relevant
diagrams are shown here. For example for 12Be the conﬁguration 6He + 2t
( 22.42 MeV) is not shown. Also not listed are situations with one or more
α in it eg. α + 2t + 2n for 12Be.

Recently exotic molecular states in 12Be have been found [14]. This was
in the study of breakup of 12Be into 6He + 6He and 4He + 8He. These
can be interprested as coming from α - 4n - α conﬁgurations [1,14]. This
is the standard way. However these same molecular resonances can also
be understood in our model in terms of Ikeda-like diagrams given here (
I thank Isao Tanihata for bringing this experiment to my attention [15] ).
Thus we can treat this experiment to be conﬁrming our prediction here also.
However, unique conﬁrmation would come when molecular conﬁgurations
rich in tritons, like for example the existence of molecular conﬁgurations 9Li
+t for 12Be breakup would be demonstrated. These experiments should be
possible with present day techniques with RIB in diﬀerent laboratories.

In summary, further experiments continue to confrm author’s recent model
prediction of strong triton clustering tendencies in neutron rich nuclei. This
helps to explain the neutron halo phenomena also. This allows us to make
predictions for triton rich molecular conﬁgurations arising from Ikeda - like
diagranms for the neutron rich nuclei.

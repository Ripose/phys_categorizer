SCALE DEPENDENT DIMENSIONALITY

Abstract

We argue that dimensionality is not absolute, but that it depends

on the scale of resolution, from the Planck to the macro scale.

1 Introduction

Is dimensionality dependent on the scale of resolution, or is it independent
of this scale. This question becomes relevant in the light of some recent work
(for example Cf.[1]).
It has ofcourse been pointed out that the spin half
character of a collection of Fermions leads to the usual three dimensionality
of our space[2, 3], while the spin half itself is associated with the Comp-
ton wavelength as discussed in recent papers (Cf. for example[4]). Further,
it was argued that as we approach the Compton scale, we encounter lower
dimensionality[5, 6]. In this paper we point out that indeed the dimension-
ality is scale dependent.

2 Scale Dependence

We ﬁrst notice that at Planck scale lP , we have

N 3/4lP ∼ R

(1)

where N ∼ 1080 is the number of elementary particles and R ∼ 1028cm the
radius of the universe. This is not an empirical relation but rather can be

deduced on the basis of a ﬂuctuational creation of particles scheme recently
In this scheme, √N particles are ﬂuc-
discussed (Cf.
tuationally created and this happens in the Compton time τ of a typical
elemental particle, a pion.
Further this corresponds to a ﬂuctuational creation of N 1/4 Planck particles
as recently argued[9], in the Planck time τP . Indeed, we have

˙N ∼ N 1/4/τP ∼

√N /τ

Equation (2) leads to (1).
(1) shows that at the Planck length, the ﬂuctuational dimensionality is 4/3.
Interestingly this is the dimension of a Koch curve and a coastline [10]. With
this dimensionality we should have

M ∝ R4/3,

which indeed is true[11].
At the Compton scale of resolution, we have[7], as indeed can be deduced
from (2) the well known Eddington formula,
√N l

R ∼

(3) shows the two dimensional character at the Compton length.
Indeed
as noted in the introduction three dimensionality is at scales much greater
than the Compton wavelength - as we approach the Compton wavelength we
encounter two dimensionality as can be seen from (3) - indeed this was the
key to explain puzzling characteristics of quarks including their fractional
charge and handedness[6].
Finally at scales L ∼ 10cm, we have

N 1/3L ∼ R
(4) shows up the usual three dimensionality.
Interestingly, if we take the typical elementary particle the pion, and con-
sider it successively as a 4/3 dimensional object at the Planck scale, a two
dimensional object at the Compton scale and three dimensional at our macro
scale, and consider successive densities

ρP ∼ m/(lP )4/3, ρπ ∼ m/l2

and ρ ∼ m/L3,

M ∼ ρP R4/3

∼ ρπR2

∼ ρR3,

we have,

as required.

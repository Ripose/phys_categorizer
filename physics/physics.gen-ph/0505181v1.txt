ON THE ORIGIN OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS

JAUME GIN´E

Abstract. Action at distance in Newtonian physics is replaced by
ﬁnite propagation speeds in classical post–Newtonian physics. As
a result, the diﬀerential equations of motion in Newtonian physics
are replaced by functional diﬀerential equations, where the delay
associated with the ﬁnite propagation speed is taken into account.
Newtonian equations of motion, with post–Newtonian corrections,
are often used to approximate the functional diﬀerential equations.
Are the ﬁnite propagation speeds the origin of the quantum me-
chanics? In this work a simple atomic model based on a functional
diﬀerential equation which reproduces the quantized Bohr atomic
model is presented.

1. Introduction

Newtonian forces (for example, the inverse square law for gravita-
tion) imply “action at distance”. This absurd, but outstandingly suc-
cessful, premise of Newtonian theory predicts that signals propagate
instantaneously. In classical physics, relativity theory postulates that
signals propagate with a velocity that does not exceed the velocity of
light. Thus, the forces of Newtonian physics must be replaced by force
laws that take into account the ﬁnite propagation speed of the classical
ﬁelds which determine the forces acting on a moving body. In turn, the
ordinary or partial diﬀerential equations of Newtonian physics, which
are derived from the second law of motion ma = F, must be replaced
by corresponding functional diﬀerential equations where the force F is
no longer a function of just position, time, and velocity; rather, the
classical force law must take into account the time delays due to the
ﬁnite propagation speed of the classical ﬁelds.

The functional diﬀerential equations of motion for classical ﬁeld the-
ory are generally diﬃcult, often impossible, to express in a form that is

amenable to analysis. Thus, in order to obtain useful dynamical pre-
dictions from realistic models, it is frequently to replace the functional
diﬀerential equations of motion by approximations that are ordinary
or partial diﬀerential equations, see [3]. The purpose in these works is
to discuss some of the mathematical issues that must be addressed to
obtain a rigorous foundation for the post–Newtonian dynamics, that is,
Newtonian dynamics with relativistic corrections, see for instance [3]
and the references therein. For the electromagnetic classical ﬁeld, in the
ideal case of a point–charge particle, the resulting retarded potentials
are the Li´enard–Wiechert potentials. For the gravitational classical
ﬁeld we must use the Einstein’s ﬁeld equation. Simple models of these
equations are the subject of current research. The basic idea of post-
Newtonian approximation, from a mathematical point of view, is the
expansion of model equations in powers of 1/c. From a physical point
of view, the idea is to consider low velocity (compared with the speed of
light). Note, for example, that the relativistic form of Newton’s second
law, where the rate of change of the momentum is given by

d
dt  

mv(1 −

|v|2
c2 )−1/2

,

!

reverts to Newton’s law in the low–velocity limit.

According to Maxwell’s ﬁeld equations, a charged particle produces
electromagnetic ﬁelds as it moves. Since, in this case, a particle radiates
energy, it must slow down. In the theory of the electron point charge
by considering motion along in a line, Dirac propose a self-force (the
radiation reaction force) given by

Fself =

2q2
3c3

...
x ,

which is the half diﬀerence of the retarded and advanced forces, where
q is the charge of the electron, see [11]. Therefore, a post-Newtonian
model for the motion of an electron, conﬁned to move on a line and
with radiation reaction taken into account, is given by the Abraham–
Lorentz equation

(1)

m¨x =

...
x + F,

2q2
3c3
where F is an external force. Since the electron radiates (produces ﬁelds
that carry energy) the self force should cause the particle to lose energy
and slow down. That’s why, the presence of the third derivative term
in the ﬁrst diﬀerential equation is called radiation damping. However,
in these post-Newtonian models (where the diﬀerential equations are

ON THE ORIGIN OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS

3

not of second order) the “runaway” solutions appear, see [11]. For
instance, in absence of external forces, equation (1) reduces to

m¨x =

2q2
3c3

...
x ,

and this equation has the solution ˙x = C where C is an arbitrary
constant, and other solutions where the acceleration is proportional
to exp(3mc3t/(2q2)). Hence, the acceleration grows indeﬁnitely with
time. This means that, a charge which goes out of a ﬁeld, when leaving
it, must self-accelerate indeﬁnitely; which is an absurd. These runaway
solutions are clearly not physical. What do they represent? How should
they be eliminated? and What is the correct Newtonian equation with
the radiation damping taken into account?

The mathematical answer to all these questions is approached in [3]
and the subsequent works [5, 6], where these post-Newtonian models
are recognized as singularly perturbed Newtonian equations. In order
to recover the correct Newtonian equations with the post-Newtonian
corrections, the Fenichel’s geometric singular perturbation theory is ap-
plied (in particular, the reduction to the slow–manifold). These New-
tonian equations with the post-Newtonian corrections give physically
reasonable dynamics; in particular, the runaway solutions are elimi-
nated. Anyway, how can we justify using these models? Note, for
instance, that the slow-manifolds in these models are unstable; nearby
runaway solutions. In applied mathematics, we usually justify approxi-
mations by their stability. To validate the slow–manifolds reductions it
must be shown that the resulting Newtonian model equations are sta-
ble with respect to the dynamics of the original functional diﬀerential
equations, the true equations of motion in classical physics. Therefore
further investigations are required in this direction for the study of the
delay equations.

However, it is interesting to note that the presence of a small delay
in a conservative system often results in damped long–term dynamics
on an associated inertial manifold, see [3, 4]. For example, the Duﬃng–
type model equation

¨x + ω2x = −ax(t − τ ) + bx3(t − τ ),
with small delay τ in the restoring force, reduce (by a formal compu-
tation to ﬁrst order in τ ) to the van der Pol–type model equation

¨x + τ (3bx2 − a) ˙x + (a + ω2)x − bx3 = 0,
on its inertial manifold. As it has been noticed in [3] this example
illustrates a phenomenon that is a reminiscent of quantization: while
most periodic solutions in one parameter families of periodic solutions

4

in a conservative system disappear in the presence of a small delay,
some persist as limit cycles. The author of [3] asks himself whether
this observation has a physical signiﬁcance.

The solutions of the functional diﬀerential equations can, however,
admit an inﬁnite discrete spectrum. For example, we consider the
retarded harmonic oscillator, given by the linear, second order, retarded
functional diﬀerential equation

¨x + x(t − τ ) = 0,

with small delay τ .
In [16] it is showed that this equation exhibits
an inﬁnite spectrum of discrete frequencies. Its general solution is a
convergent linear combination of oscillations at an inﬁnity of discrete
(“quantized”) frequencies. As in quantum mechanics, in order to de-
termine a unique solution an initial function needs to be known. The
above consideration remains valid for any linear functional diﬀerential
equation with constant coeﬃcients and constant delay. Moreover, the
locally linear approximation suggests that such “quantization” is also
to be expected for non–linear functional diﬀerential equations.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Planck [12] initiated the quan-
tum mechanics with his contribution to the black body radiation. Ein-
stein [8], following the ideas of Planck [12], contributed to the devel-
opment of the theory of quanta which is the embryonic step needed to
It is interesting to note that
arrive to the Quantum physics theory.
Poincar´e had been implicated in the discussion of the quantum theory,
but the premature death of Poincar´e deprives of its contributions in
this theory, see for instance [14, 15]. In fact, Poincar´e participated in
the ﬁrst congress of Solvay in October of 1911 and he died in July of
1912. One of the interesting known phenomenon studied by Poincar´e is
the concept of limit cycle, see [13]. This phenomenon does not occur in
the Hamiltonian systems studied by standard physics theories. It only
appears in systems with friction, i.e., systems with dissipative energy.
It is also interesting to note that one of the problems which orig-
inates the quantum theory was the problem that appears when the
idea of the planetarium system is applied to the atomic model. This
idea was proposed by Rutherford in 1911 [18] as a consequence of the
experimental results obtained when bombing an atom with α parti-
cles. The problem in the model of Rutherford was that the charged
electrons are accelerated in their movement around the nucleus and by
the electromagnetic classical theory any accelerated charged body ra-
diates energy. The problem of the atomic stability was initially solved
by Bohr in 1913 [1] and it marks the success of the quantum theory
and its posterior development. The atomic model of Bohr predicts the

ON THE ORIGIN OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS

radiation spectrum of certain atoms and the quantization of the energy
in diﬀerent energy levels is then obtained.

If you see the development of the quantum theory from the initial
contributions, it is evident that each step is made with extra assump-
tions. For instance, the introduction of the quanta in the radiation of
a black body and in the foto–electric eﬀect, cf. [8], the quantization of
the energy in the movement of an electron which moves as an harmonic
oscillator under the inﬂuence of an harmonic restoring force, cf.
[12].
Another example is the quantization of the angular orbital impulse of
an electron in an atom, although the electron in an atom is accelerated
in its movement around the nucleus. In this last case, it is assumed
that this electron does not radiate energy, see [1]. However, we notice
the diﬀerence between the Bohr quantization of the angular orbital im-
pulse of an electron, which moves under the Coulomb force (L = n~
for n = 1, 2, 3, . . ., where ~ is a multiple of the Planck constant h di-
vided by 2π), and the Planck quantization of the energy of a particle,
as an electron, which moves as an harmonic oscillator (E = nhν for
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .). In fact the quantization of the angular orbital impulse
of an electron leads to the quantization of the total energy but with an
equation quite diﬀerent than the Planck equation.

In [9] it is showed that the intrinsic phenomenon (the quantization of
the energy) that appears in the ﬁrst and simple systems initially studied
by the quantum theory as the harmonic oscillator and the movement
of a charged particle under the Coulomb force, can be obtained from
the study of dissipative systems.
In other words, it is showed that
the phenomenon of the quantization of the energy of a particle which
moves as an harmonic oscillator can be obtained via a classical system
of equations. The same assertion also applies to the phenomenon of
the quantization of the energy of a charged particle which moves under
the Coulomb force and which loses and wins energy (for example if
we consider the classical case where the electron radiates and absorbs
energy from the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus). Therefore, these phenom-
ena are not intrinsic of the quantum theory, but also appear in classical
systems. In fact, they appear in the qualitative theory of diﬀerential
equations developed by Poincar´e from 1881 [13].

Nevertheless, the most important problem is to ﬁnd the exact form
of the dissipative term and the interpretation of its physical mean-
ing, see [9]. The retarded case, already explicitly incorporates certain
subtle mathematical features of electrodynamics and relativity noticed
by Poincar´e, but overlooked by Einstein and subsequent researchers.
Based on the study of the retarded systems, a simple atomic model

6

J. GIN´E

given by a functional diﬀerential equation which reproduces the quan-
tized Bohr atomic model is presented in this paper.

The paper is not at all an alternative to the quantum theory, because
the large development of the quantum theory in all the past century,
the success in all its predictions, is outside of all doubt. On the other
hand, the proposed model does not reﬂect the whole rich behavior
of the quantum modern theories developed from 1925 by Schr¨odinger
[19, 20, 21], Born [2], Heisenberg [10], Dirac [7], and others. The goal
of the paper is to ask if the ﬁnite propagation speeds is the origin of
the quantum mechanics.

To begin with, in [16], it is assumed that the two particles are ro-
tating rigidly in circular orbits around a common center of masses.
Moreover, a force which varies inversely as the square of the retarded
distance is considered. The retarded distance is the distance from the
current position of the electron to the ”last seen” position of the proton.
The simple expression for the force helps us to intuitively understand
the consequences of a delay and under such circumstances, the angular
momentum cannot be conserved. Thus, we have the astonishing situa-
tion that, purely under the action of internal forces, the system suﬀers
a net torque. Now, the radiation term is introduced. But, the exact
form of the radiation damping term is not clear. Finally, the simple
heuristic case of the retarded inverse square force is used, to determine
whether there can be a balance of forces between the delay torque and
the 3rd order radiation damping. A total success does not take place
and a value of r which is smaller than the Bohr radius is obtained.
Nevertheless, the author, in [16], aﬃrms that further investigations are
required to determine the exact eﬀects of radiative damping, and that
it was prematurely concluded that radiative damping makes the clas-
sical hydrogen atom unstable.
In the following section we present a
simple atomic model based on a functional diﬀerential equation which
reproduces the quantized Bohr atomic model.

2. The retarded electrodynamic 2-body problem

We consider two particles interacting through the retarded inverse
square force. The force on the electron exerted by the proton is given
by

Figure 1. The retarded electrodynamic 2-body problem.

The force acts in the direction of the 3–vector r, along which the proton
is ”last seen” by the electron. The 3–vector r may be represented by

r = rp(t − τ ) − re(t),

where rp(t) and re(t) denote respectively the instantaneous position
vectors of the proton and electron, respectively, at time t, and τ is
the delay, so that rp(t − τ ) is the ”last seen” position of the proton.
Assuming that the two particles are in rigid rotation with constant
angular velocity ω, and referring back to Fig. 1, we have, in 3–vector
notation,

re = r1[cos ωt ˆı + sin ωt ˆ],

rp = −r2[cos ω(t − τ ) ˆı + sin ω(t − τ ) ˆ].

Hence, the 3–vector r is given by

r = [−r2 cos ω(t − τ ) − r1 cos ωt] ˆı + [−r2 sin ω(t − τ ) − r1 sin ωt] ˆ,

Now, we introduce the polar coordinates (r, θ) and deﬁne the unitary
vectors l = cos θ ˆı+sin θ ˆ and n = − sin θ ˆı+cos θ ˆ. By straightforward
calculations it is easy to see that the components of the force (2) in the
polar coordinates are

In 1913 Bohr [1] introduced the quantization of the angular momen-
tum of the form L = nh/(2π) where h is the Planck constant. If we
accurately study equation (5) we see that the analytic function sin(ωτ )
has a numerable number of zeros

ωτ = kπ ,

with k ∈ Z, which are stationary orbits of the system of equations (3)
and (4). When when ωτ 6= kπ we have a torque which conduces the
electron to the stationary orbits without torque with ωτ = kπ. On the
other hand in a ﬁrst approximation the delay τ can be equal to r/c
(the time that the ﬁeld uses to goes from the proton to the electron at
the speed of the light). From equation (6) we have

τ =

Taking into account that ω = vθ/r, from (7) we have vθ/c = kπ. But
from the theory of relativity we know that vθ/c < 1, then we must
introduce a new constant g in the delay. Hence, τ = gr/c and the new
equation (7) is

and now vθ/c = kπ/g, i.e. vθ = kπc/g and from (8) we also have
r = kπc/(gω). In our model case of a classical rigid rotation we have
˙θ = ω and ¨θ = 0. Hence, equation (4)
θ = ωt with ω > 0. Therefore,
for ωτ = kπ is

which implies ˙r = 0 and r = rk where rk is a constant for each k. On
the other hand, equation (3) for ωτ = kπ takes the form

assuming that τ is small and then r ∼ r1 + r2. From the deﬁnition of

Therefore we have (identifying k2 = n) that Planck constant satisﬁes
the relation

The dimensional analysis gives [J · s] = [Kg][m/s]2/[rad/s] which is
correct. As the value of the constant angular speed ω is not known we
express his value in function of k and the radius rk

To obtain the value of the constant g we substitute ω in (11) and
evaluate at n = 1 (i.e. k = 1) and we obtain

where a0 is the Bohr radius at the fundamental level. Substituting into
equation (12) the value of the reduced mass of the hydrogen atom m,
the value of the speed of light c and the value of the Bohr radius of the
fundamental level a0 we obtain that the adimensional constant is g =
429.868. From equation (10) (using the quantiﬁcation of Bohr, because
we have identiﬁed it with the quantiﬁcation that we have found) we
obtain

and substituting into equation (9) we arrive to the Bohr radius

taking into account that K = 1/(4πǫ). Finally, the energy levels are
given by

As a consequence, substituting into equation (12) the explicit expres-
sion of the Borh radius a0 = h2ǫ/(πe2) we get the explicit value of the
Planck constant

The introduction of a new fundamental constant is avoided (as it hap-
pens in the quantum mechanics with the Planck constant) because
through the retard the speed of the light c appears. The appearance of
this dimensional constant c, usually absent in the non–relativistic quan-
tum mechanics, allows to give the expressions of the physical quantities
with the correct dimensions.

I notice that this value of g = 429.868 is the inverse value of the ﬁne
structure constant 1/α = 137.036 multiplied by π, that is, g = π/α.
Moreover, the value of this ﬁne structure constant α is

J. GIN´E

h =

α =

,

and when substituting this value of g in the explicit expression of the
Planck constant (15) the equality is identically satisﬁed. Therefore we
have found the value of the adimensional constant g and consequently
the expression of the delay τ which is
πr
αc

(16)

τ =

.

Moreover, we have that vθ/c = kπ/g = kα which is consequent with
the deﬁnition of α. One of the interpretations of the ﬁne structure
constant α is that α relates the speed of the electron in the lowest
energy level in the atom of hydrogen with the speed of the light. This
is straightforward because if we substitute the expression (14) of rn in
the expression (13) of vθ for the case n = 1 and we divide by the speed
of the light c, we obtain that vθ/c = α.

Summarizing, we could have begun our analysis with the founded
retard deﬁnition (16), because our model reproduces the Borh atom
faithfully. Quantum mechanics in the Borh atom is in fact the ﬁrst
approximation in the value v/c in the delay. It seems that with the
second approximation in (v/c)2 in the delay we will obtain the ﬁne
structure corrections of Sommerfeld [22] to the hydrogen atom.

The fact that the Planck constant is expressed in function of the
parameters associated to the particular model system (see (15)) is a
problem.
If we consider another model system, usually another ex-
pression of the Planck constant would appear and another numerical
value for the constant g would have to be chosen, and hence another
expression for the delay.

ON THE ORIGIN OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICS

From the fact that the atomic Bohr model can be completely de-
scribed by means of functional diﬀerential equations, I believe that in
the future, observing the physical reality at a deeper level, we will be
able to interpret the laws of probability of the quantum physics as the
statistical results of values of certain variables perfectly determined
that at the moment are hidden for us...(I know that this idea it has
been extremely discussed) the history of science shows us that the cur-
rent state of the knowledge is always provisional and that it should
exists, beyond what is known, immense regions to be discovered. How-
ever, functional diﬀerential equations are fundamentally diﬀerent from
ordinary diﬀerential equations, and their solutions can have qualita-
tive features which are impossible for solutions of ordinary diﬀerential
equations. The physical consequences of these diﬀerences are explained
at length in [17]. I mean that the rich features that can appear in func-
tional diﬀerential equations may explain quantum mechanics, from a
deeper point of view.

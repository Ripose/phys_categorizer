Linear algebra of reduced units and discussion of temperature

Abstract

A formal linear vector ﬁeld representation for scientiﬁc equations is developed
to rationalize the intuitive methods that are constantly employed. It is shown
that unlike mechanical units that appear in the basis of the space, the reduced
temperature and Boltzmann parameter cannot be described by the basis set
individually and can only be described as a product. Further, the deﬁnition
and determination of temperature is dependent on theory and not on standard
mechanical units. It is shown that there is no reason to reduce the number
of degrees of freedom in temperature determination via equipartition since
stochastic variables are involved, and this observation is signiﬁcant in that the
temperature variable reported in simulation studies would have a discrepancy
to the extent of using the decreased number of freedom, which is most cases
is not large nor signiﬁcant. The standard assignments used in reduced units
do not lead to errors because operationally the resulting reduced temperature
parameter represents the reduced product of the temperature and Boltzmann
parameters. The non-independence of these quantities explains why entropy
and other associated functions cannot be calculated directly, but are always
scaled in dimensionless increments of the Boltzmann parameter

The scalar multiplication of element cα1.dα by q ∈ F is deﬁned as

q(cα.dα) = (cα1 .q).dα.

For any vectors α, β , γ where αi = αi.dα in space dα, the operator ⊕ is
commutative, associative, and properties (1) and (2) ensures that 0 = 0.dα
and ⊖αi = −αi.dα so that α ⊕ 0 = α for all α in dα and α ⊕ (⊖α) = 0.
From (1) and (2), we infer that {α} forms a one dimensional vector space.
From experience, only similar quantities may be added, which leads to Axiom
1.

Axiom 1 In scientiﬁc equations, the addition operation between vectors be-
longing to diﬀerent dimensional basis is not possible, so that if dα 6= dβ then
αi.dα ⊕ βi.dβ is not deﬁned.

From Axiom 1, it follows that cα.dα is a 1-Dimensional vector space with

the unique zero 0.[

The vector spaces are therefore linearly dependent. Scientiﬁcally, the choice

2 Discussion and veriﬁcations

2.1

(a)some standard applications

In the laboratory [M ] basis, the interparticle potential has sometimes been
modeled according to (7); a change in the unit basis implies converting the
laboratory frame of units given in (7) to another [M∗ ] with form given by (11).
In this situation,let there be a unit basis of length such that σ.[ML ] = 1.[M∗
L ]
M∗0L∗1T∗0

or in detail σ[ML ] = σ.

the energy scale as ǫ.[ME ] = 1.[M∗

(b)the temperature parameter

2.2
The above theory represents scientiﬁc numbers in terms of cα. [Mα1 Lα2Tα3],
and clearly, if a unit cannot be expressed in terms of the deﬁned basis given
here, then absolutely no scaling parameter λ exists for that quantity, and
in particular (a.c)∗ 6= a∗.c∗ since the isomorphic properties of the above-
mentioned operators only apply to quantities with an associated dimension
cα.[Mα ]; for example scaling with ﬁxed parameters (m, σ, ǫ) means that the
1/2, where
velocity scaling parameter λv is deﬁned such that v∗ = v
the dimension of this quantity, as well as the scaling parameters all have the
form cα.[Mα ]. Temperature (and other associated properties) do not emerge
directly from mechanical analysis - where the basis dimensions are deﬁned -
but from theoretical models or deﬁnitions, and in particular cannot be deﬁned
in the form cα.[Mα ] . It is therefore misleading to suppose that a λT divisor
must exist for this quantity such that T ∗ = T
λT which is often suggested e.g. [2,
Table 1.]; the actual implication, as shown below is the deﬁnition of another
temperature scale T = kBT where T ∗ =
. Likewise the Boltzmann
coupling parameter kB has a unit which is reciprocal to temperature, imply-
ing that it cannot be expressed in the form cβ.[Mβ ] and hence this parameter
cannot be reduced in isolation by setting ”‘kB = 1, so that the MD unit of
temperature is also deﬁned”’ [3, pp.15-16]. This assumption of the funda-
mental mechanical autonomy of the coupling parameter and temperature is
however rather standard and pervasive [1, p.200]and in nearly all cases, the
standard assignments are correct, which is explained below.

In MD simulations, the temperature is determined via the classical equipar-
tition theorem (which is known from experience and quantum mechanics not
to obtain at lower temperatures for the free vibrational and rotational modes)
for all temperatures from the mean kinetic energy of translation where

(kBT ) =

and where D = 2, 3 for two and three dimensional systems respectively for
an N particle system where the angle brackets denotes some chosen aver-
aging algorithm that is thought to approximate the outcome if the P den-
sity function mentioned below is used in an exact evaluation. Investigators
claim that due to ”‘conservation of momentum”’, there are D degrees of
freedom that must not be counted in (19),[3, 4, p.16 and pp.46-47 respec-
tively]. The probability density function P over the (p, q) momentum and
kBT /Q
positional coordinates for the above averaging process is P = exp
kB T dp dq deﬁned as the phase integral, which is the
with Q =
analog of the quantum partition function for the canonical distribution.H is

i /2m >= D
density, each particle yields < p2
2 (kBT ) , where clearly the deﬁni-
tion of T is the consequence of stochastic averaging; it is not a fundamental
mechanical quantity associated with a basis dimension. Extending this result
to N particles is thought to yield (19) , which is routinely used to compute
the temperature in simulations. Averaging the kinetic energy of H using P
(which already has the constraint over the entire ensemble of total energy
conservation - from where the β parameter from the Lagrange multiplier rep-
resents the kBT term and the α term from the Lagrange multiplier refers to
total particle conservation which is featured in the phase integral or partition
function) does not indicate any such reduction of degrees of freedom. Indeed,
from the Gibbs’ postulate of the equivalence of ensemble average to that of the
time average of a particular system, one can view each particle as a system,
from which we can expect that the time average of the mean kinetic energy
of any given particle would equal D
2 kBT with the same kBT as given in (19)
for the entire system of which it is a part. Further, the supposed reduction of
the number of degrees of freedom implies that no temperature can exist for
a system comprising of D or less particles, and this is patently absurd, for it
is eminently feasible to conceive and implement thermostats in MD for such
systems. Hence the proper form of the temperature must be derived from the
probability density function and/or Gibbs’ postulate with the average energy
per particle given as D

assumption, together with the autonomy of variables, the correct results are

There are clear-cut consequences that follow from whether (a) an indepen-

entropic quantities based on the Boltzmann postulate for entropy S given by
S = kB ln W , case (a) implies S∗ = ln W , or a direct determination is possi-
ble for the entropy; (b) suggests a work-around, such as scaling equations as

(i)S′ = (S/kB) or (ii) E′ = (T S) in constant temperature studies. The tech-
niques used in entropic studies use(i) and (ii) or a variant of (ii) through the
determination ﬁrst of the chemical potential scaled in kBT units [1, pp.246-
249], or in coupling methods (utilizing thermodynamical integration), S/kB is
the variable that is scaled in simulations (method (i) ) [1, p.260].It is proposed
here that simulations utilize variants of either (i) or (ii) above as a direct con-
sequence of (b), that an independent kB and T (or k∗
B and T ∗) does not exist
for scaling.

Abstract

We review a cosmology in which particles are ﬂuctuationally cre-
ated from a background Zero Point Field. This cosmology is consis-
tent with recent observations of an ever expanding and accelerating
universe, as also the recently conﬁrmed evolution of the ﬁne struc-
ture constant. All hitherto mysterious and accidental, so called Large
Number coincidences, infact follow from the theory.

1 Introduction

From early 1998, the conventional wisdom of cosmology that had concretized
from the mid sixties onwards, began to be challenged. It had been believed
that the density of the universe is near its critical value, separating eternal
expansion and ultimate contraction, while the nuances of the dark matter
theories were being ﬁne tuned. However the work of Perlmutter and others
[1, 2] began appearing in 1998 and told a diﬀerent story. These observa-
tions of distant supernovae indicated that contrary to widely held belief, the
universe was not only not decelarating, it was actually accelerating. This
paradigm shift permeated to the popular press also. For example an article
in the Scientiﬁc American [3] observed, ”In recent years the ﬁeld of cosmol-
ogy has gone through a radical upheaval. New discoveries have challenged
long held theories about the evolution of the universe... Now that observers
have made a strong case for cosmic acceleration, theorists must explain it....
If the recent turmoil is anything to go by, we had better keep our options
open.”

On the other hand, the Physics World observed [4], ”A revolution is taking
place in cosmology. New ideas are usurping traditional notions about the
composition of the universe, the relationship between geometry and destiny,
and Einstein’s greatest blunder.”
The infamous cosmological constant was resurrected and now it was ”dark
energy” that was in the air, rather than dark matter.
Shortly before these dramatic discoveries, the author had presented a cos-
mological model based on ﬂuctuations in an all permeating Zero Point Field
[5, 6, 7, 8]. This model is consistent with astrophysical observations and pre-
dicts an ever expanding and accelerating universe. It deduces from theory
the so called large number coincidences including the purely empirical Wein-
berg formula that connects the pion mass to the Hubble Constant [9, 10].
Let us now examine this cosmology and some of its implications.

2 Fluctuations and Cosmology

We ﬁrst observe that the concept of a Zero Point Field (ZPF) or Quantum
Vacuum (or Ether) is an idea whose origin can be traced back to Max Planck
himself. Quantum Field Theory attributes the ZPF to the virtual Quantum
Eﬀects of an already present electromagnetic ﬁeld [11]. There is another
approach, sometimes called Stochastic Electrodynamics which treats the ZPF
as primary and attributes to it Quantum Mechanical eﬀects [12, 13]. It may
be observed that the ZPF results in the well known experimentally veriﬁed
Casimir eﬀect [14, 15]. We would also like to point out that contrary to
popular belief, the concept of Ether has survived over the decades through
the works of Dirac, Vigier, Prigogine, String Theoriests like Wilzeck and
others [16]-[24]. It appears that even Einstein himself continued to believe
in this concept [25].
We would ﬁrst like to observe that the energy of the ﬂuctuations in the
background electromagnetic ﬁeld could lead to the formation of elementary
particles.
Infact it is known that this energy of ﬂuctuation in a region of
length l is given by [26]

∼
In the above if l is taken to be the Compton wavelength of a typical ele-
mentary particle, then we recover its energy mc2, as can be easily veriﬁed.

It may be mentioned that Einstein himself had believed that the electron
was a result of such condensation from the background electromagnetic ﬁeld
(Cf.[27, 7, 8] for details). We also take the pion to represent a typical ele-
mentary particle, as in the literature.
To proceed, as there are N

1080 such particles in the universe, we get

∼

Nm = M

where M is the mass of the universe.
In the following we will use N as the sole cosmological parameter.
Equating the gravitational potential energy of the pion in a three dimensional
isotropic sphere of pions of radius R, the radius of the universe, with the rest
energy of the pion, we can deduce the well known relation [28, 29]

where M can be obtained from (1).
We now use the fact that given N particles, the ﬂuctuation in the particle
number is of the order √N[29, 30, 7, 8, 5, 6], while a typical time interval
¯h/mc2, the Compton time. We will come back to
for the ﬂuctuations is
this point later. So we have

∼

whence on integration we get,

We can easily verify that equation (3) is indeed satisﬁed where T is the age
of the universe. Next by diﬀerentiating (2) with respect to t we get

where H in (4) can be identiﬁed with the Hubble Constant, and using (2) is
given by,

dius and age of the universe can be deduced given N as the sole cosmological
or large scale parameter. Equation (5) can be written as

Equation (6) has been empirically known as an ”accidental” or ”mysterious”
relation. As observed by Weinberg[10], this is unexplained: it relates a single
cosmological parameter H to constants from microphysics. We will touch
upon this micro-macro nexus again. In our formulation, equation (6) is no
longer a mysterious coincidence but rather a consequence.
As (5) and (4) are not exact equations but rather, order of magnitude rela-
tions, it follows that a small cosmological constant

is allowed such that

is very very small - this
This is consistent with observation and shows that
has been a puzzle, the so called cosmological constant problem [31]. But it
is explained here.
√N (due to the
To proceed we observe that because of the ﬂuctuation of
ZPF), there is an excess electrical potential energy of the electron, which
infact we have identiﬁed as its inertial energy. That is [7, 29],

or without using (2), we get, instead, the well known so called Eddington
formula,

physical constants) because of their central role in atomic (and sub atomic)
physics.
Next if we use G from (9) in (5), we can see that

Thus apart from the fact that H has the same inverse time dependance on
T as G, (10) shows that given the microphysical constants, and N, we can
deduce the Hubble Constant also, as from (10) or (5).
Using (1) and (2), we can now deduce that

Next (8) and (3) give,

(11) and (12) are consistent with observation.
Finally, we observe that using M, GandH from the above, we get

The relation (13) is required in the Friedman model of the expanding uni-
verse (and the Steady State model also).
The above model predicts an ever expanding and possibly accelerating uni-
verse whose density keeps decreasing. This seemed to go against the accepted
idea that the density of the universe equalled the critical density required for
closure.

3 Issues and Ramiﬁcations

i) The above cosmology exhibits a time variation of the gravitational constant
of the form

Indeed this is true in a few other schemes also, including Dirac’s cosmology
[33, 34, 27]). Interestingly it can be shown that such a time variation
(Cf.

can explain the precession of the perihelion of Mercury (Cf.
[35]). It can
also provide an alternative explanation for dark matter and the bending of
light while the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation is also explained
(Cf.[27]).
It is also possible to deduce the existence of gravitational waves given (14).
To see this quickly let us consider the Poisson equation for the metric gµν

2gµν = Gρuµuν

(15)

∇
The solution of (15) is given by

gµν = G

Indeed equations similar to (15) and (16) hold for the Newtonian gravita-
tional potential also. If we use the second time derivative of G from (14)
in (16), along with (15), we can immediately obtain the D’alembertian wave
equation for gravitational waves, instead of the Poisson equation:

2gµν ≈
ii) Recently a small variation with time of the ﬁne structure constant has been
detected and reconﬁrmed by Webb and coworkers [36, 37]. This observation
is consistent with the above cosmology. We can see this as follows. We use
an equation due to Kuhne [38]

If we now use the fact that the cosmological constant Λ is given by

as can be seen from (4), in (17), we get using (18),

which is the same as Webb’s result.
We give another derivation of (20) in the above context wherein, as the num-
ber of particles in the universe increases with time, we go from the Planck
scale to the Compton scale.
This can be seen as follows: In equation (7), if the number of particles in
the universe, N = 1, then the mass m would be the Planck mass. In this
case the classical Schwarzschild radius of the Planck mass would equal its
Quantum Mechanical Compton wavelength. To put it another way, all the
energy would be gravitational (Cf.[27] for details). However as the number
of particles N increases with time, according to (3), gravitation and electro-
magnetism get diﬀerentiated and we get (7) and the Compton scale.
It is known that the Compton length, due to zitterbewegung causes a cor-
rection to the electrostatic potential which an orbiting electron experiences,
rather like the Darwin term [11].

where ∆α is the change in the ﬁne structure constant from the early universe.
(22) is an equivalent form of (20) (Cf.ref.[38]), and is the result originally
obtained by Webb et al (Cf.refs.[36, 37]).

which immediately leads to the mysterious Weinberg formula (6). Thus this
is the balance between the cosmos at large and the micro cosmos.
iv) In General Relativity as well as in the Newtonian Theory, we have, with-
out a cosmological constant

¨R =

−

πGρR

(23)

We remember that there is an uncertainity in time to the extent of the
Compton time τ , and also if we now use the fact that G varies with time,
(23) becomes on using (14),

¨R =

Remembering that at any point of time, the age of the universe, that is t
itself is given by (3), we can see from (24) that this eﬀect of time variation
of G, which again is due to the background Zero Point Field is the same as
an additional density, the vacuum density given by

τ
t (cid:19)

πρR

(24)

G/t

−

(cid:18)

(25)

(26)

This term in (24) is also equivalent to the presence of a cosmological constant
Λ as discussed above. On the other hand, we know independently that
the presence of a vacuum ﬁeld leads to a cosmological constant given by
(Cf.ref.[27] and references therein)

Equation (26) is pleasingly in agreement with (24) and (25) that is, the pre-
ceeding considerations. In other words quantitatively we have reconﬁrmed
that it is the background Zero Point Field that manifests itself as the cos-
mological constant described in Section 2. This also gives as pointed out an
explanation for the so called cosmological constant problem [31] viz., why is
the cosmological constant so small?
v) In the above cosmology of ﬂuctuations, our starting point was the creation

ρvac =

ρ
√N

Λ = Gρvac

of √N particles within the minimum time interval, a typical elementary par-
ticle Compton time τ . A rationale for this, very much in the spirit of the
condensation of particles from a background Zero Point Field as discussed
at the beginning of Section 2, has also been obtained recently in terms of
a broken symmetry phase transition from the Zero Point Field or Quantum
Vacuum. In this case, particles are like the Benard cells which form in ﬂu-
ids, as a result of a phase transition. While some of the particles or cells
may revert to the Zero Point Field, on the whole there is a creation of these
particles.
If the average time for the creation of one of these particles or
cells is τ , then at any point of time where there are N such particles, the
time elapsed, in our case the age of the universe, would be given by (3) (Cf.
[40]). While this is not exactly the Big Bang scenario, there is nevertheless
a rapid creation of matter from the background Quantum Vacuum or Zero
Point Field. Thus half the matter of the universe would have been created
within a fraction of a second.
In any case when τ
0, we recover the Big Bang scenario with a singular
creation of matter, while when τ
Planck time we recover the Prigogine
Cosmology (Cf.[27] for details). However in neither of these two limits we
can deduce all the above consistent with observation relations.
vi) The above cosmological model is related to the fact that there are mini-
mum space time intervals l, τ . Indeed in this case it is known that there is
an underlying non commutative geometry of spacetime [41, 42, 43] given by

→

→

[x, y]

≈

0(l2), [x, px] = ı¯h[1 + βl2], [t, E] = ı¯h[1 + γτ 2]

(27)

Interestingly (27) implies modiﬁcation to the usual Uncertainity Principle,
and this in turn can also be interpreted in terms of a variable speed of light
cosmology [44, 45, 46].
The relations (27), lead to the modiﬁed Uncertainity relation

(28)

(28) appears also in Quantum SuperString Theory and is related to the well
known Duality relation

(Cf.[47, 48]). In any case (28) is symptomatic of the fact that we cannot go
down to arbitrarily small space time intervals. We observe that the ﬁrst term

α′/R

R

of (28) gives the usual Uncertainity relation. In the second term, we write
∆p = ∆Nmc, where ∆N is the Uncertainity in the number of particles, N,
in the universe. Also ∆x = R, the radius of the universe where

the famous Eddington relationship. It should be stressed that the otherwise
emperical Eddington formula, arises quite naturally in a Brownian charac-
terisation of the universe as has been pointed out earlier (Cf.
for example
ref.[49]). Put simply (8) is the Random Walk equation
We now get,

This is the uncertainity in the particle number, we used earlier. Substituting
this in the time analogue of the second term of (28), we immediately get, T
being the age of the universe,

√Nl,

R

∼

∆N = √N

T = √N τ

which is equation (3). So, our cosmology is self consistent with the modiﬁed
relation (28).
Interestingly these minimum space time considerations can be related to the
Feynmann-Wheeler Instantaneous Action At a Distance formulation (Cf.[50,
51, 52]).
We ﬁnally remark that relations like (27) and (28), which can also be ex-
pressed in the form, a being the minimum length,

(and can be considered to be truncated from a full series on the right hand
side (Cf.
[53]), could be deduced from the rather simple model of a ﬁxed
lattice - a one dimensional lattice for simplicity. In this case we will have
(Cf.[27])

where a is the lattice length, l the Compton length in our case. The energy
time relation now leads to a correction to the mass energy formula, viz

This is the contribution of the extra term in the Uncertainity Principle.
vii) It is well known that the Planck scale is an absolute minimum scale in
the universe. In Section 3, ii) we argued that with the passage of time the
Planck scale would evolve to the present day elementary particle Compton
scale. This can also be seen in the following way: We have by deﬁnition

¯hG/c3 = l2
P

l = N 1/4lP

where lP is the Planck length
get

∼

10−33cms. If we use (9) in the above we will

(29)

Similarly we have

(30)

τ = N 1/4τP
In (29) and (30) l and τ denote the typical elementary particle Compton
length and time scale, and N is the number of such elementary particles
in the universe. We could explain these equations in terms of the Benard
cell like elementary particles referred to above. This time there are total of
n = √N Planck particles and (29) and (30) are the analogues of equations
(3) and (8) in the context of the formation of such particles. Indeed it is
10−5gms, has a Compton life time
well known that a Planck mass, mP ∼
and also a Bekenstein Radiation life time of the order of the Planck time.
These space time scales are much too small and we encounter much too large
energies from the point of view of our observed limits. As noted above our
observed scale is the Compton scale, in which Planck scale phenomena are
moderated. In any case it can be seen from the above that as the number
of particles N increases, the scale evolves from the Planck to the Compton
scale. Interestingly another way to looking at the above is that the particles
can be considered to be the ﬂuctuational eﬀect of the ﬂuctuationally created
√N particles (Cf.[27]).
So, the scenario which emerges is, that as the universe evolves, Planck parti-
cles form the underpinning for elementary particles, which in turn form the
underpinning for the universe by being formed continuously.
This can be conﬁrmed by the following argument: We can rewrite (29) as

l = ν′√T

ν′ = lP /√τ

¯h/mP

≈

11

(31)

wherein we have used (3). Equation (31) is identical to the Nelsonian-
Brownian Theory which is infact the underpinning for equations like (3)
or (8), except that this time we have the same Brownian Theory operating
from the Planck scale to the Compton scale, instead of from the Compton
scale to the edge of the universe as seen above (Cf. also [49, 27]).
Interestingly, let us apply the above scenario of √n Planck particles forming
an elementary particle, to the extra term of the modiﬁed Uncertainity Prin-
ciple (28), as we did earlier in section (iv). Remembering that α′ = l2
P in the
theory, and ∆p = N 1/4mP c, in this case, we get, as ∆x = l,

l = N 1/4lP ,

which will be recognized as (29) itself! Thus once again we see how the
above cosmology is consistently tied up with the non commutative space
time expressed by equations (27) or (28).
It may be mentioned that, as indeed can be seen from (29) and (30), in this
model, the velocity of light remains constant.

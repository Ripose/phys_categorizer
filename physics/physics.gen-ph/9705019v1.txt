Abstract

The hypothesis about possible existence of new class of particles able to travel faster
then light as a source of dark matter, recently formulated by L. Gonzalez-Mesters, is
analyzed. To this end the general geometrical model for several kinds of matter with
diﬀerent Lorentziann structures coexisting on the same manifold is introduced and
the local energy density in cosmological reference frame is calculated in two particular
cases. It is shown that the local energy density is positive in both considered cases
and hence such models really may describe cosmological dark matter. Nevertheless,
some problems may appear during the construction of the cosmological models or the
models of the compact objects. Moreover, the simplest generalization of the model
lead to some variants of vector-tensor theory of gravitation with preferable reference
frame which contradict to observations.

1 Introduction

In this note we discuss the hypothesis about new class of particles able to travel faster then
light as a possible source of dark matter, which was proposed recently by L.Gonzalez-Mestres
[1]. According to this hypothesis, the apparent Lorentz invariance of classical space-time can
be viewed as a symmetry of the equations of motion of observed matter. In this case no
reference to absolute properties of space and time is required and besides the usual particles
and ﬁelds, whose speed could not exceed the speed of light c, an another kinds of matter
may exists, whose particles have limiting speed c1 >> c.
It was argued, that if there is
no direct interaction between such two (or more) kinds of matter then their coexistence
does not violate the apparent Lorentz invariance of the laws of physics but may provide
most of the cosmic dark matter and produce very high energy cosmic rays compatible with
some unexplained discoveries (see for example [1] and references therein). This hypothesis
was analyzed in [1] on pure heuristic level without consideration of possible mechanisms of
gravitational interaction between diﬀerent sorts of matter.

In principle, the hypothesis about coexistence of diﬀerent noninteracting kinds of matter
may be associated with some ideas connecting with formalism of quantum gravity. Namely,
the space-time in classical gravity has metric with Lorentzian signature while the formalism
of continual integration of quantum gravity uses metric with Euclidean signature. The
connection between Euclidean and Lorentzian metric is realized by Wick rotation. There
are diﬀerent points of view on this procedure, beginning from the consideration of Wick
rotation as a pure formal method until Hawking’s assumption about Euclidean nature of
space-time [2]. If this assumption is valid, then it is naturally to suppose, that among the
knowing kinds of matter with apparent Lorentzian structure of space-time the other sorts of
matter with their own Lorentzian structures may exist.

In another context the assumption about possible coexistence of diﬀerent sorts of matter
on the same manifold was formulated in [3] where the geometrical model for four nonin-
teracting classes of matter with diﬀerent Lorentzian structures was given. It was pointed
out lately, that the existence of matter with nonstandard Lorentzian structure may give
contribution into the energy-momentum tensor [4], but the corresponding models were not
analyzed in details.

In this note the geometric ideas of papers [3, 4] are used to analyze the hypothesis [1].
To this end in the next section the general geometrical background for diﬀerent Lorentziann
structures which correspond to diﬀerent sorts of matter on the same Riemannian manifold
will be formulated. The resulting energy-momentum tensor is considered in the section 3 for
two particular models when the light cone of the usual matter are in the interior of the ”light
cone” of the ”superluminal” matter and when the ”light cones” of usual and ”superluminal”
matter have empty intersection. Section 4 contains some concluding remarks and discussion.

2 The multiple Lorentziann structures on the Rieman-

nian manifold

It is clear, that in the most general form the hypothesis about coexistence of two or more
diﬀerent Lorentzian structures on the same manifold, which correspond to the diﬀerent
classes of matter, leads to some kind of bi- or multi-metric gravitation theory. To provide the
gravitational interaction between particles and ﬁelds corresponding to diﬀerent Lorentziann
structures, the metrics, which deﬁne these structures, must be connected with each other.
In this paper the particular form of such connection is used.

Our approach is based on the well known correspondence between Riemannian structure
of manifold, the ﬁeld of line elements on it and the Lorentziann structures on the same
manifolds. Namely, let Gαβ is a Riemannian metric on manifold, uα is a unit vector ﬁeld
(Gαβuαuβ = 1) representing the ﬁeld of line elements and c = const > 0 is a light speed,
then

gαβ = (c2 + 1)uαuβ −

Gαβ

is Lorentziann metric on the same manifold. To apply the above equation to the analysis of
the correspondence between several Lorentziann structures on the same Riemannian mani-
fold, let’s suppose that space-time has Riemannian metric Gαβ with signature (+, +, +, +)
and the apparent Lorentzian structure, which is associated with observed matter, is deﬁned
by equation (1) with the light speed c = 1 (in geometrical units). Vector ﬁeld uα in (1) may
be considered as generator of cosmological reference frame. According to the hypothesis [1]
let’s suppose also that among the usual Lorentziann structure there is additional Lorentziann
structure on the same manifold, which correspond to nonobservable (dark) matter and is
deﬁned by unit vector ﬁeld vβ 6
to the observed and hypothetical dark matter, are deﬁned by

= uα and the ”light speed” c1 > 1.
By such a way we obtain a bimetric-type model, whose metrics gαβ and qαβ, corresponding

gαβ = 2uαuβ −

Gαβ

and

1 + 1)vαvβ −
Following to [1], the particles which moves in Lorentziann metric qαβ will be called ”super-
luminal” or ”dark matter”.

and qαβ are given by (see also ):

Using the well known equations of the bimetric formalism it is easy to obtain expressions

which connect the covariant derivatives with respect to metrics Gαβ, gαβ and qαβ.

Equations (2)-(9) make possible to analyze the gravitational interaction between of the

usual (observable) matter and nonobservable (dark) matter.

3 Energy-momentum tensor of dark matter in the sim-

plest model

For simplicity in this section we consider two massive scalar ﬁelds ϕ and ψ, one of which
(ϕ) corresponds to the usual (observed) matter with metric (2) and the other ﬁeld (ψ)
corresponds to nonobserved (dark) matter whose own Lorentziann structure are deﬁned by
metric (3). Simplest action functional for such model may be written in the form

where Rg is the Ricci scalar of the metric (2), Lϕ and Lψ are the Lagrangians of the ﬁelds
ϕ and ψ correspondingly:

where mϕ and mψ are the masses of the corresponding ﬁelds and the coeﬃcient c1 in (10)
is present because of (4). The geometrical units with c = κ = 1, where κ is Einsteinian
gravitational constant, is used here. The absence of mixed ϕψ terms in (10) provide the
Lorentz invariance of the motion equations of the usual matter (ϕ) and nonobservability of
the hypothetical matter (ψ).

structure does not change the local Lorentz invariance of the ﬁeld (and motion) equations

particular cases when the light cons of the usual and ”superluminal” matter are collinear (

It is easy to see, that the local energy density in this case is positive because uρψ,ρ and m2

4 Concluding remarks

In the modern classical general relativity metric of space-time depends on the matter distri-
bution. However the signature of the metric, which deﬁnes the local Lorentziann structure of
space-time, is supposed to be ﬁxed. It may be supposed that the local Lorentziann structure
of space-time is also deﬁned by the features of matter. If such supposition is true then the

6

question about uniqueness of such structure is naturally appears. This question may be
reformulated also as the question about possible coexistence on the same manifold several
diﬀerent classes of matter which generate diﬀerent non-equivalent Lorentziann structures.

As it was argued in [1], the coexisting of such diﬀerent classes of matter without direct
interaction between them does not contradict to the apparent Lorentz invariance of the laws
of physics. On the other hand it may provide most of the cosmic dark matter and produce
very high energy cosmic rays compatible with some unexplained discoveries (see for example
[1] and references therein).

It is shown that such diﬀerent classes of matter, which is mentioned in[1], may be nat-
urally described using the well known correspondence (1) between Riemannian structure of
manifold (Riemannian metric Gαβ), the ﬁeld of line elements on it (represented by the unit
vector ﬁeld uα) and the Lorentziann structures (Loretzian metric gαβ) on the same manifold.
Using this correspondence, two Lorentzian structures gαβ and qαβ on the same manifold
(M 4, G) may be connected by equation (5), which may be used for description of the gravi-
tational interaction between the usual matter, which moves in metric gαβ, and hypothetical
matter moving in metric qαβ. Using the simplest model it was shown that the presence
of the additional kind of matter with its own Lorentziann structure does not change the
local Lorentz invariance of the ﬁeld (and motion) equations for the usual matter but gives
additional term in the right-hand side of Einstein equation. This additional term may be
considered as the energy-momentum tensor of dark matter.

In the case then hypothetical dark matter is represented by massive scalar ﬁeld ψ its
energy-momentum tensor is given be equation (19) for colinear light cones or (22) for or-
thogonal light cones. The corresponding local energy density in cosmological reference frame
connected with vector ﬁeld uα is given by equations (20) and (23) respectively. In both cases
the local energy density is positive, so both models may describe cosmological dark matter.
It is clear, that in the case of colinear light cones the homogeneous isotropic cosmological so-
lutions for metric gαβ may be easily constructed as well as in the standard general relativity
while in the case of orthogonal light cones metric gαβ may be spatially homogeneous in this
case only if the metrics qi
αβ are static. On the other hand, there are no obvious problems
with construction of the models of the compact objects for the usual matter with the metric
gαβ in the case with orthogonal light cones, while the case of colinear light cones may lead
to the apparent violation of the equivalence principle because any concentration of the usual
(observable) matter is an attractor for dark matter and vice versa.

The action (10), which where considered in the previous section, is non-symmetric with
respect to metrics gαβ and qαβ: action (10) may be varied with respect to metric gαβ or with
respect to metric qαβ but not both. Moreover, the ﬁelds uα and vα remain undeﬁned and
their nature is unclear. The introduction of these ﬁelds in Lagrangian as usual massive or
massless vector ﬁelds leads to some variant of vector-tensor gravitation theory with prefer-
able reference frame, whereas it is known that the existence of such frames contradicts to
observations [6].

Thus, the hypothesis [1] that the cosmological dark matter is generated by the hypothet-
ical particles which able to travel faster then light has rather simple geometrical realization,
but its consistency with observations is problematic.

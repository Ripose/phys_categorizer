Abstract

The physical nature of the ﬂuorescence depletion (FD) eﬀect and

the possible way of its experimental study are discussed.

PACS number: 42.50.-p

The FD eﬀect is used for many years as an eﬃcient time-domain method of
rotational spectroscopy for large polyatomic molecules [1-3]. In this method,
the picosecond laser pulse is split into the pump and the probe pulses, which
are focused at the molecular jet. Time and frequency- integrated ﬂuorescence
intensity from the sample is studied as a function of the delay between the
pump and the probe laser pulses. The observed rotational recurrences allow
to obtain the corresponding rotational constants of the ground and excited
states of the molecule [4-6].

However, the physical nature of the FD eﬀect is practically unknown for
present day. There exists rather formal phenomenological description, which
is based on the concepts of coherency, quantum interference and quantum
It is worth to note, that this situation is rather typical in
beats [1].
nonlinear optics, where phenomenological description often takes
the place of the physical explanation. As a result, some problems ap-
pear, if one wants to understand the physical sense of such a descriptions
[7].

A real physical explanation of the FD eﬀect must be based on the suppo-
sition that the laser pulse “interacts preferentially with those species whose
transition dipoles are aligned along its polarization vector at the instant that
it passes through the sample” [1]. But this correct idea should be extended
further: the absorption cross-section of laser radiation by molecules depends
on the orientation of the molecule in space, on the angle between the axes
of the molecule and that of the laser beam. How strong is this dependence?
How sharp is it? These are obviously the most interesting questions now.
The FD eﬀect provides us an excellent possibility to obtain such informa-
tion.
It is surprising that no one has studied the nature of FD eﬀect till
now.

In all cases extremely intense pump and probe laser pulses of equal en-
ergy were used [8]. This situation meets the needs of the four photon mixing
eﬀect, but it isn’t suited to the study of the physical nature of the eﬀect.
The intensity of the pump beam should be usually smaller, than the satura-
tion intensity. The intensity of the probe beam should be still substantially
smaller (0,01— 0,1 of the pump beam). It shouldn’t perturb the system. In
these conditions an eﬃcient lock-in technique can be used [9,10]. Besides the
usual pump-probe delay dependence of the ﬂuorescence intensity, the main
goal of such experiments should be the study of the dependence of the FD
eﬀect on the angle between the pump and the probe beams [8]. For high
intensity regime, the latter dependence is expected to be relatively ﬂat. But
for the low intensity regime, when four-photon mixing eﬀects can be sup-
pressed, the dependence of the FD eﬀect on the angle between the two laser
beams is expected to be sharper.

Careful experimental study of the FD eﬀect may be also very useful for
studying the physical nature of the so-called population transfer eﬀect with
counterintuitive sequence of interactions with two radiation pulses (CSI)
In this case, the most eﬃcient population transfer between two
[11,12].
low lying states takes place when the Stokes pulse overlaps and precedes
the pump one. Again, we have a phenomenological description of this eﬀect
[13,14], but its physical explanation is absent till now. The CSI eﬀect takes
place even when broad femtosecond laser pulses interact with large poly-
atomic molecules in a condensed phase [7,15]. In this case the CSI eﬀect is
the ﬁrst step of the four photon mixing process, and the laser pulses duration
determines the value of the so-called peak shift [15-18].

Thus, experimental investigation of the physical nature of the FD eﬀect
is much more important and interesting, than simple study of the rotational
spectra of large polyatomic molecules.

Abstract

An orbiting ‘photon clock’ is proposed to test directly the relativity of simultaneity of special
relativity. This is done by comparison of the arrival times at a ground station of three microwave
signals transmitted by two satellites following the same low Earth orbit. A similar experiment
may be performed using synchronised signals from two GPS satellites with the receiver on a
single satellite in low Earth orbit

PACS 03.30.+p

Einstein’s original paper on special relativity (SR) [1] discussed three physical eﬀects
which changed completely our conceptual understanding of space and time. These are:
relativity of simultaneity (RS), length contraction (LC) and time dilatation (TD). RS
and LC are closely related. In the space-time Lorentz transformation (LT) a:

x′ = γ(x − vt)
t′ = γ(t − βx
c

)

(1)

(2)

both eﬀects result from the spatial dependence (the term −γβx/c) of the time trans-
formation equation (2). LC is given by a ∆t = 0 projection of the LT [2]. Because of
RS, events which are simultaneous in S (i.e. have ∆t = 0) are not so in S’, resulting in
LC [2, 3]. One hundred years after the publication of Einstein’s paper only the TD eﬀect
has been experimentally conﬁrmed. For a concise review of experimental tests of SR see
Reference [4]. Unlike LC, the TD eﬀect (a ∆x′ = 0 projection of the LT [2]) does not
involve RS since the space-time events concerned occur always at a ﬁxed position in S’
–the spatial coordinate of the clock under consideration.

The purpose of this letter is to propose a direct experimental test of RS. The enor-
mous improvement, in recent decades, of the precision of time measurements due to the
widespread application of atomic clocks much facilitates the test. A test of the related LC
eﬀect seems, in contrast, to be much more diﬃcult [4]. The proposed experiment is an ac-
tual realisation, in space, of the light-signal clock synchronisation procedure proposed by
Einstein in [1]. However, no actual experimental clock synchronisation is needed. At the

aThe frame S’ (space-time coordinates x′,t′) moves along the positive x-axis of S (space-time coordinates x,t) with
velocity v. Ox′ is parallel to Ox. Clocks in S and S’ are synchronised so that t = t′ = 0 when the origins of S and S’
coincide. β ≡ v/c, γ ≡ 1/p1 − β2.

practical level the experiment can be considered as a sequel to the Spacelab experiment
NAVEX [5] in which special and general relativity (TD and the gravitational blue shift)
were tested by comparing a caesium clock in a space shuttle in a low, almost-circular,
orbit around the Earth with a similar, synchronised, clock at a ground station. The
experiment requires two satellites, one of which could conveniently be the International
Space Station (ISS) which has orbit parameters similar to those of the NAVEX shuttle,
the other a shuttle, or other satellite, following the same orbit as the ISS but separated
from it by a few hundred kilometers.

A scheme of the proposed experiment is shown in Fig.1. Two satellites, A and B, in
low Earth orbit, separated by the distance L, pass near to a ground station C. Cartesian
coordinate systems are deﬁned in the co-moving inertial frame of the satellites (S’) and
the ground station (S). The origin of S’ is chosen midway between A and B with x′-axis
parallel to the direction of motion of the satellites and y′ axis outwardly directed in the
plane of the orbit. Ox and Oy are parallel to O’x and O’y at the position of closest
approach (culmination) of O’ to C. Clocks in S and S’ are synchronised at t = t′ = 0
at culmination, where the coordinates of O’ in S are: (x,y,z) = (0,H,D) and the relative
velocity of S and S’ is v. It is assumed in the following that for space time events at the
satellites the LT equations (1) and (2) are valid between the frames S and S’, not only at
t = t′ = 0, but for neighbouring timesb.

A microwave signal is sent from B towards A so as to arrive there at the time t′ = −L/c
(Fig.1a). The signal is detected and reﬂected promptly back towards B. After a delay
tD(A) the signal S(1)
A is sent from A to C. The reﬂected signal from A arrives back at
B at time t′ = 0 (Fig.1b). It is detected and reﬂected promptly back towards A. After
a delay tD(B) the signal SB is sent from B to C. At time t′ = L/c the inter-satellite
signal arrives for a second time at A and after the delay tD(A) sends the signal S(2)
A to
C (Fig1c). The space-time coordinates of the emission events of the signals S(1)
A , SB and
S(2)
A , as calculated using the LT (1) and (2) are presented in Table 1. Taking into account
the propagation times of the signals from A and B to C the following diﬀerences of arrival
times of the signals at C are found:

It is interesting to note that RS, as manifested in the non-vanishing value of ∆t in (5)
when tD(A) = tD(B) = 0, is an O(β) eﬀect, not an O(β2) one as for LC and TD. The term
2βL/c in (5) originates from the second (spatially-dependent) term in the LT of time,(2),
responsible for RS. The orbital velocity of the ISS is 7.674 km/s (β = 2.56 × 10−5) [6].
bThat is, the change of the co-moving inertial frame due to the actual, nearly circular, orbital motion of the satellites

is neglected for small values of t and t′.

Since the ground station velocity in much less than thisc, this is essentially the same as
the relative velocity in (5). Choosing L = 400km (for the ISS H ≃ 350km [6]) and setting
tD(A) = tD(B) = 0 in (5) gives ∆t = 2βL/c = 68.3ns. Such a time diﬀerence is easily
measurable with modern techniques. Signal arrival times in the NAVEX experiment were
quoted with 1ns precision. The uncertainities in the clock rates for the relativity tests
in NAVEX corresponded to an experimental time resolution of ≃ 0.1ns over one rotation
period (1.6h) of the shuttle. The contribution of the last term on the right side of (5)
is negligible. For L/R = 1 and delays as long as 1µs it contributes only 0.05ns to ∆t
for β = 2.56 × 10−5. Thus ∆t is essentially independent of the distance between the
satellites and the ground station at culmination. The last term on the right side of (5)
also gives the systematic uncertainty due to that on the time of culmination. If the latter
is denoted as σ(tC) the corresponding value of d = dA = dB is vσ(tC)/L. The RMS error
of the twelve culmination times reported [5] by the NAVEX experiment is 26ns. The
corresponding uncertainty on ∆t given by (5) is then 2βσ(tC)L/R ≃ 1.3 × 10−3ns for
L/R = 1, completely negligable as compared to 68.3ns. During the total transit time of
the microwave signals in the ‘photon clock’ constituted by the satellites, the latter move
in S only a distance ≃ 2Lβ = 10.2m. Diﬀerent times of emission of the signal sequence
are easily taken into account by a suitable choice of the delay times tD(A), tD(B).

Although a particular coordinate system and clock synchronisation are used to cal-
culate the entries of Table 1 and the time diﬀerences δtBA and δtAB in (5), the quantity
∆t is independent of this choice, so no clock synchronisation is required to measure ∆t.
If, however, pre-synchronised clocks are availabe in the satellites they may be used to
generate the signal sequence: S(1)
A , without the necessity of ‘photon clock’ sig-
nals between the satellites. The latter in fact may be considered to eﬀect a real-time
synchronisation of hypothetical clocks in A and B. In this case, a simpler direct measure-
ment of RS is possible. Sending signals SA and SB at the same time in S’, when O’ is
at culmination, the LT (1) and (2) predict that the signals will be observed at C with a
time diﬀerence of βL/c, half the value of ∆t in the photon clock experiment.

An interesting variant of this last experiment may be performed using the synchro-
nised satellite clocks of the Global Positioning System (GPS). The latter provide, after
correction of their proper times for the eﬀects of relativistic time dilatation and gravi-

Figure 2: Test of relativity of simultaneity using GPS satellites as transmitters and a satellite, R, in
low Earth orbit as receiver. The sizes of the Earth, E, and the orbit of the GPS satellites are shown
approximately to scale; for clarity the size of the orbit of R is enlarged. Signals emitted synchronously
in the ECI frame (S’) by GPS1 and GPS2 are received at R when it is at x′ = 0. According to the
relativity of simultaneity of standard special relativity, the signals are received, in the proper frame,
S, of R, with a time diﬀerence of ∆t = vL/c2, where v is the velocity of R relative to the ECI frame.

tational blue shift, a coordinate time, tC, deﬁned in the ECI (Earth-centered inertial)
reference frame [7]. This frame, with a constant orientation relative to the ﬁxed stars,
may be identiﬁed with the frame S’ in Fig.1 so that t′ ≡ tC while the ground-based station
C in S is replaced (see Fig.2) by a satellite, R, in low Earth orbit in the same plane as
the orbits of a group of four GPS satellites GPS1-GPS4. In the experiment, signals are
sent simultaneously, in the ECI frame, from GPS1 and GPS2, at such a time as to arrive
at R when it is in the position, visible from the satellites, at which x′ = 0. This corre-
[7]. The calculation of the
sponds, in GPS nomenclature, to ‘transmitter time tagging’
time diﬀerence ∆t of arrival of the signals at R in S is similar to that for the experiment
shown in Fig.1. Relativity of simultaneity predicts ∆t = βL/c whered L = 3.76 × 104
km. With β = 2.56 × 10−5 as for the ISS, ∆t = 3.20 µsec or 960 m at the speed of light.
This may be compared with the horizontal spatial accuracy of 100 m for the Standard
Positioning Service (SPS), or of 22 m for the Precision Poitioning Service (PPS) [8]. As
for the experiment shown in Fig.1, the expected eﬀect is suﬃciently large to be observed,
with a huge statistical signiﬁcance, in a single ‘pass’ of the experiment. The possibility
to observe such an eﬀect using the GPS has been previously mentioned [7]e. The order
of magnitude of the eﬀect was correctly estimated, but no deﬁnite experimental test was
considered.

In view of the large observable eﬀect predicted for the experiment in Fig.2, it is
interesting to consider a similar experiment where the GPS receiver is not on the Satellite
R, but at a ﬁxed point on the Earth’s surface, as in the usual operational mode of the GPS.
In this case β in the formula ∆t = βL/c is not the orbital velocity of R of ≃ 7.6 km/sec
but is rather the projection into the plane of the GPS satellite orbits of the velocity of
the receiver due to the rotation of the Earth. The maximum eﬀect occurs for a receiver
at the Equator, viz: vrot cos 55◦ = 0.47 × 0.574 = 0.27 km/secf . This corresponds to a
value of ∆t of 113 ns, or 34 m at the speed of light. As this is of the same order as the
PPS accuracy, and three times smaller than the SPS accuracy, no detectable eﬀects due
to the non-vanishing of ∆t is to be expected on the SPS performance at ﬁxed points on
the surface of the Earth.

The ease of measurement of the O(β) RS eﬀect may be contrasted with the diﬃculty of
measuring, in a similar experiment, the O(β2) LC eﬀect. Using the value β = 2.56 × 10−5
appropriate for the ISS, the apparent contraction of the distance between the satellites
A and B, as viewed at some instant in S, of (1 − 1/γ)L, amounts to only 131µm for
L = 400 km. It is hard to concieve any experiment using currently known techniques
with suﬃciently good spatial resolution to measure such tiny eﬀects.

In a recent paper by the present author [4] it has been suggested, in order to avoid
certain casual paradoxes of SR [3], and to ensure translational invariance, that the origin
of the frame S’ in the LT (1) and (2) should be, in all cases, chosen to coincide with the
position of the transformed event (a ‘local’ LT). In this case it is predicted that ∆t = 0
for tD(A) = tD(B) = 0 in (5) and that signals emitted simultaneously in S’ from A and B

dThe radii of the circular orbits of GPS satellites are taken to be 2.66 × 104 km, correponding to a rotation period

of 11 h 58 min [7].

eIn fact the discussion occured, perhaps appropriately, in a section entitled ‘Confusion and consternation’ in this
article. The eﬀect was incorrectly estimated using the shortest distance between a GPS satellite and the low Earth
orbit, rather than the distance L in Fig.2. Simultaneous signals, from two spatially separated clocks in the same
inertial frame, as observed in another inertial frame, are required for the relativity of simultaneity eﬀect.

f The planes of the orbits of GPS satellites are at an angle of 55◦ to the equatorial plane of the Earth [7].

at culmination will be received at the same time in S at C. Similarly, ∆t is also expected
to vanish in the experiment using synchronised signals from GPS satellites.

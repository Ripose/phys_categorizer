Abstract. Although its practical eﬃciency is unquestionable, the thermodynamic tool
presents a slight inconsistency from the theoretical point of view. After exposing argu-
ments, which explain this opinion, a suggestion is put forward to solve the problem. It
∆m c2 to the laws of thermodynamics. This
consists of linking the mass-energy relation
±
combination results in a clariﬁcation of the theory and opens a bridge between thermody-
namics and gravitation. It is shown that the submicroscopic consideration, which is based
on the cellular concept of the real physical space when the space is treated as the tessel-
lation lattice, indeed strongly supports the idea of a variation in mass in thermodynamic
processes.

Dr. Jean-Louis Tane is a retired scientist whose speciality is geology that he taught during
more than thirty years at Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France, and during three
years at the University of Marrakech, Morocco. Most of his papers deal with geologic top-
ics, particularly the problem of the origin of spilitic rocks, yet one of his courses concerned
the use of thermodynamics in geochemistry. His interest for physics has been conﬁrmed
recently, by the writing of several papers suggesting a link between thermodynamics and
relativity. They have been published, between 2000 and 2004 in the Journal of Theoretics.

1. Statement of the problem

Following typical thermodynamic courses (see, e.g. Refs.

[1-4]), let us consider the
experimental context of an isolated system composed of two parts separated by a mobile
piston. We assume that part 1 contains a gas whose initial pressure is P1 while part 2
is a vacuum. If the piston, previously locked, is released, the gas expands into the whole
system and the thermodynamic interpretation usually given to the process is based on the
two following equations

dU = dQ + dW ,

dU = T dS

P dV ,

−

(1)

(2)

whose signiﬁcations and mutual relations are well-known. A more conventional writing
of eq. (1) would be dU = δQ + δW , but the simpliﬁed and general transcription adopted
here has no inﬂuence on the discussion presented below. Note that the usual reasoning
tend to focus attention on the gas for which it is successively written:

dQ = 0 (since the gas cannot exchange heat with the vacuum);

dW = 0 (since, by deﬁnition, dW =

PextdV , where Pext is the pressure external to
the gas, i.e. the pressure Pext = 0 of the vacuum and dV the change in volume of the gas);

−

dU = 0 (being the sum dQ + dW );

then owing to the equality dU = 0 we have dS = (P/T )dV where the three quantities P,
T and dV are positive and hence dS is positive too.

2

On this basis, it is implicitly admitted that the relation dU = 0 is true not only for the
gas, but equally for the whole system deﬁned as isolated. It is precisely upon this point
that an important and interesting problem arises.

To be rapidly convinced of this reality, let us imagine an experimental context identical
to the one just considered, except that instead of being vacuum, part 2 would contain a
gas whose initial pressure is P2. In such a case, applying equation dW =
PextdV to part
1 and part 2 leads to the doublet of equations:

−

dW 1 =

P 2 dV1,

dW 2 =

P 1dV 2.

−

−

Noting that dV 2 =

dV 1, we get for the whole system

−

dW = dV1(P1 −

P2).

(3)

Since dV1 is positive when P1 > P2 and negative when P1 < P2, equation (3) shows
that dW is always positive and reaches the value zero only when P1 = P2. In other words,
we are facing the fact that the disappearance of the pressure gradient within the system
is accompanied by an additional energy whose origin in inside this system.

The process examined just before (expansion of a gas in vacuum) corresponds to the
particular case for which P2 = 0 in equation (3), so that dW has a positive value, not a
zero value as previously recalled and classically accepted. This is the sign that the vacuum
plays an important role in the calculation. When equation dW =
P extdV is applied to
it, Pext corresponds to the pressure of the gas and dV to the decreasing volume of the
vacuum, which can be noted dV vacuum. Accordingly, dWvacuum has a positive value and
represents at the same time dW system, given that dW gas is zero.

−

Transposing these results in equation (1), and applying it to the whole system, we
see that the only condition to obtain dU system = 0 is that dQsystem should be negative.
Such a condition is not compatible with one of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics
(sometimes called the law of heat exchange), which relies on the idea that an exchange
of heat between two parts 1 and 2 of an isolated system is described by the relation
dQ2 =

dQ1. At the scale of the whole system, this relation leads to the conclusion

−

dQ = dQ1 + dQ2 = 0.

(4)

where dQ1 and dQ2 represent the change in heat for the gas and the vacuum.

As will be explained further, it is highly probable that the true value of dQ is not zero
but positive. At the present stage of the discussion, combining the idea that dQ is not
negative with the fact, already noted, that dW is positive provides a suﬃcient condition
to conclude that dU is itself positive. Hence, there is really something not clear in the
usual conception of thermodynamics, which is based on the idea that the internal energy
change dU for an isolated system obeys the double equation

dU = dQ + dW = 0.

(1b)

2. A suggestion to solve the problem

We have seen in the section 1 that the disappearance of the pressure gradient within
an isolated system is accompanied by a creation of energy inside this system. Previously
we [5-9] preliminary analyzed of the problem and proposed a way to its solution. Now let
us elucidate all the aspects of the problem in detail.

We can give to this energy created inside the system studied the designation dW int,
in order to distinguish it from the energy dW ext that (in the more general case of a
non isolated system) corresponds to the exchange of work between the system and its
surroundings. With these designations, dW takes the signiﬁcation

dW = dW ext + dW int.

The condition dW ext = 0 means that the system is isolated (in the sense classically
given to this concept in thermodynamics). The condition dW int = 0 means that there is
no pressure gradient (i.e. no irreversibility of pressure) within this system. Contrary to
dW int, which, as already seen, obeys the relation

dW int ≥

0.

The value of dWext can be positive or negative, depending on whether the system

receives work or gives work in its exchanges with the surroundings.

If the system we are considering is not isolated but only closed, the work dW exchanged
with its surroundings (and whose precise designation is dW ext) is given, as recalled above,
Pext dW . If we are under conditions of reversibility,
by the classical expression dW =
i.e. if Pext = Pint, this relation becomes dW =
PintdV . Observing that Pext can always
be written Pext =

P int + Pint + Pext, we get the general; expression

−

−

−

which means

that is

dW =

P intdV

−

(P ext−

−

P int)dV ,

dW irr = dW rev + dWint,

dW irr = dW ext + dW int.

Each term of eqs. (8) and (9) has the same value and signiﬁcation as the corresponding

term of equation (7). An important point to be noted is that dW ext = dW rev.

As concerns the exchanges of heat and their relations with the concept of entropy, the

usual thermodynamic tool is given by the well-known expression

which can be represented in the form

To be coherent with the reasoning previously adopted, eq. (10), which has the dimen-
sionality of entropy, needs to be converted in an equation having the dimensionality of
energy, i.e.

TextdS = dQ + TextdSint.

whose signiﬁcation is

that is

dQ = dQext + dQint,

dQirr = dQrev + dQint.

Each term of eqs. (12) and (13) has the same value and signiﬁcation as the corre-
sponding term of eq. (11). As well as we have observed that dW ext = dW rev we see here
that dQext = dQrev but this last equality is not a novelty. In the usual conception of the
thermodynamic theory, it is an implicit equation whose integration leads to eq. (21) that
will be used further.

In the same manner as we have introduced a diﬀerence between dW ext and dW int in
eq. (5) and a diﬀerence between dQext and dQint in eq. (12), we now easily conceive that
there is a diﬀerence between dU ext and dU int. It can be expressed through the general
equation

which can be better written (as explained hereafter) in the form

dU = dU ext + dUint,

dU ∗ = dUext + dUint

dU irr = dU rev + dU int.

dW ∗ = dWext + dW int

dQ∗ = dQext + dQint.

whose meaning is

respectively

and

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

For reasons of homogeneity with eq.

(15), equations (5) and (12) can be written

In conventional thermodynamics, dU ext is generally noted dU . It is to avoid the risk
of an additional confusion that the sum dU ext + dU int has been noted dU ∗ (and not simply
dU ) in eq. (15). The conceptual diﬃculty which is often encountered in learning (and
teaching) thermodynamics comes from the fact that dU int is not recognized as an energy,
so that dU ∗ and dU ext are not diﬀerentiated. Consequently, they are expressed through
the same designation dU with the drawback evoked above.

We have just recalled that the term usually noted dU in thermodynamics corresponds
to the one noted dU ext in eq. (15). Concerning the energetic quantity dU int and given that
it is generated within the system, there is no other solution to explain its origin as that
of a correlative decrease in mass, according to the Einstein mass-energy relation. Since
this relation was not known when the laws of thermodynamics have been stated, we easily
conceive that it was not evident for their authors to imagine such a possibility, all the more
that the decrease in mass is generally much too small to be experimentally detectable.

The practical and well-known eﬃciency of the thermodynamic tool is evidently due to
the fact that although not identiﬁed as an energy, the term dU int is nevertheless taken into
account through the concept of the internal component of entropy, usually noted dSint. We
have to note that being a physical reality, dU int is not easy to eliminate. It is certainly for
this reason that the art of playing thermodynamics often looks like an acrobatic feat whose

5

objective is to convert dU int into dSint everywhere it appears. For instance, at the study
of anomalies in water, we [10,11] were forced to introduce an additional correction to the
Gibbs potential called “the change of the Gibbs potential associated with intermolecular
S)∆T ; this potential deﬁnitely
interaction (or the conﬁguration potential)” Gin.in. = (Cp −
introduced a correction to the entropy S of the water system studied.

On the other hand, let us now look at the Einstein mass-energy relation that classi-
cally is presented through the expression E = mc 2 where c is the speed of light. In the
diﬀerential form its becomes

dE = c2dm,

c 2dm, since dE is positive when
which would be preferably written for our case as dE =
dm is negative and conversely. Transposed in the language of thermodynamics and taking
into account the term dU int previously explained, this expression becomes

−

dU int =

c 2dm.

(18)

−
We have seen above that dU int is the energy created within a system, due to the
disappearance of an internal gradient that is of an internal irreversibility. Combining this
data with the observation, evidenced for a long time by scientists, that every kind of
irreversibility generates heat, both the term dW int of eq. (5) and the term dQint of eq.
(13) can appear as being heat.

The great diﬀerence between the theory suggested here and the classical one lies in the
origin of the heat, which is linked to irreversibility. In conventional thermodynamics, this
heat is considered as coming from the fact that the energy received by the system, from
its surroundings, is partly transformed into thermal energy. In our theory, the energetic
quantity dU int is considered as resulting from a partial disintegration of mass inside the
system. For a better understanding of this diﬀerence, a practical and numerical example
is examined below.

3. A numerical application of the suggested
theory

Let us consider an isolated system composed of two parts 1 and 2, each of them
containing liquid water. We suppose that the initial temperature T1 of part 1 is 293 K
(20◦ C) and that the initial temperature T2 of part 2 is 333 K (60◦ C). We know that the
evolution of the system consists of an irreversible exchange of heat between the two parts,
until they reach the same ﬁnal temperature Tf . We also know that T f is given by the
relation

Tf = (C1T1 + C2T2)/(C1 + C2)

(19)

where C1 and C2 are the heat capacities of part 1 and part 2, respectively. To simplify
the calculation without reducing its interest, we can assume that the mass of water is the
same in each part and choose it in such a way that C1 = C2 = 1 J. Since C = 4.18 J for
one gram of water, the mass we have to consider is 1/(4.18) = 0.223 [g]. Knowing that
liquid water is a condensed form of water, we can also note that C designates indiﬀerently

6

Cv and Cp (whose values are quite equal in such a case) and that we make an acceptable
approximation in considering that C does not vary signiﬁcantly with temperature.

Admitting these considerations, the diﬀerence between the classical interpretation and

the one suggested presently is the following.

3.1. The classical interpretation

Eq. (19) gives

Tf = (1

293 + 1

333)/(1 + 1)K = 313K.

From the general relation

so that, for the whole system

∆ U = ∆Q = ∆U 1 + ∆U 2= 0.
Concerning the entropy change, the general equation is

so that, for the whole system:
∆S = 0.066030 JK−1
0.061939 JK−1 = 0.00409 JK−1.
The important point to keep in mind is that ∆U is zero, while ∆S is positive.

3.2. The new suggested interpretation

By integration, eq. (11) leads to an expression, which can be written

ext∆S = ∆Q + T ∗
T ∗

ext∆Sint,

(23)

whose meaning is

as follows:

In eq. (23), T ∗

ext represents the average external temperature that can be calculated

∆U ∗ = ∆Uext + ∆Uint.

for part 1, its value is T ∗
for part 2, its value is T ∗

ext = T ∗
ext = T ∗

7

Contrary to T1 and T2, which are varying both in space and in time, T ∗

2 can
be seen as space-time parameters, whose values are constant for the process we are
considering. In a more general way, this peculiarity appears as a characteristic of T ∗

1 and T ∗

ext.

The terms ∆Q1, ∆Q2, ∆S1 and ∆S2 having the numerical values already calculated

in section 3.1, when applying eq. (23) to part 1 and part 2 we get successively

∆Uint = ∆Uint1 + ∆Uint2 = 1.32 J + 1.24 J = 2.56 J,

∆Uext = ∆Uext1 + ∆Uext2 = 20 J

20 J = 0,

−

so that

∆U ∗ = ∆Uext + ∆Uint, i.e. ∆U ∗ = 0 J + 2.56 J = 2.56 J.

The essential point is that the value ∆Uext = 0 corresponds to the fact that the whole

system is deﬁned as isolated.

The value ∆Uint > 0 corresponds to the fact that the evolution of this system (dis-
appearance of an internal temperature gradient) is accompanied by an increase in energy
whose value is 2.56 J and whose corresponding decrease in mass (according to the Einstein
mass-energy relation) is

Although this latter value is evidently too small to be detectable experimentally, it

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

appears as the logic inference of the reasoning adopted.

4. The concept of free energy in the suggested
theory

The concept of free energy, introduced by Gibbs, is of great usefulness in the thermo-
dynamic study of chemical reactions. It is generally noted G and deﬁned by the well-known
equation

(25)

G = U + P V

T S

−

8

whose diﬀerential form is

dG = dU + d(P V

T S)

−

The point to be careful with when considering G in the light of the new suggested
theory is that dU , in eq. (26), corresponds to dUext that can itself be written indiﬀerently
as

whose meaning is dUext = dUreversible, or as

dUext = T ∗

dUint,

dUext = dUrev.

Thus we see that equation (28) is really coherent with eq. (27).
Taking into account these considerations, the whole meaning of eq. (26) can itself be

understood through two equivalent interpretations:

4.1. The ﬁrst interpretation

4.2. The second interpretation

The second interpretation is equivalent to the ﬁrst one, but using dUext as deﬁned by

equation (28)

which (after the same treatment as that already done), is reduced to

−

dG = T ∗

Both equations are the same but the ﬁrst transcription gives the formula to calculate

dG (29), while the second shows that dG is correlated to a change in mass (32).

dG = c2dm.

For a practical example of the use of these equations, let us come back to the exchange
of heat between the two parts of the isolated system previously considered and to the
interpretation presented in the section 3.2.

We are in a situation for which dV is negligible, so that eq. (30) is reduced to

so that, for the whole system, ∆G = ∆G1 + ∆G2 =

2.56 J.

−

This result being the same (with an inversion of sign) as the one obtained in the

section 3.2, we see that ∆G is eﬀectively equivalent to - ∆Uint.

In the case of a chemical reaction, the negative value of ∆G corresponds to the dis-
appearance, within the system, of a gradient in chemical potential. This peculiarity is a
well-known data of the classical theory. The complementary information we obtain now
is that the negative value of ∆G is accompanied by a decrease in mass.

The fact that conventional thermodynamics does not take into account the decrease
in mass, which is linked to a chemical reaction, is probably the reason why it is not of
common use in the study of nuclear reactions, which are eﬀectively characterized by a
change in mass.
It seems that this diﬃculty disappears when the enlarged conception
suggested here is substituted to the classical one.

After this preliminary consideration based on macroscopic thermodynamics, we will

now examine the problem from the submicroscopic point of view.

5. Submicroscopic consideration

5.1. Space structure and quantum mechanics

Let us turn now to a microscopic consideration of a dynamic system. What has to be
proved is the realistic mass exchange between the system studied and the ambient space.
Obviously orthodox quantum mechanics cannot solve the problem, because it treats mass
of a quantum system as an invariable classical parameter. At the same time relativistic
experiments demonstrate that the mass is not a constant but changes with the system’s
velocity. This means that something is wrong in our comprehension of the fundamentals,
namely: There is no any connection between conventional quantum physics and relativity.
Very recently a rigorous mathematical theory of the real physical space has been
developed by Bounias and Krasnoholovets [12-14]. The theory shows that the real space
represents a mathematical lattice, called the tessellattice, packing with elementary cells

10

whose size can be estimated as the Planck one,
degenerate space-time, i.e. in this case all cells (in other words, balls) are degenerated.

10−35 m. The tessellattice represents a

∼

A particled cell provides a formalism describing the elementary particles proposed in
Refs.
[13,14]. In this respect, mass is determined by a fractal reduction of volume of a
cell, while just a reduction of volume as in degenerate cells, which was initially postulated
in Refs.
[15-17], is not suﬃcient to provide mass (because a dimensional increase is a
necessary condition [13]). Accordingly, if V0 is the volume of an absolutely free cell,
then the reduction of volume resulting from a fractal concavity is the following: Vpart =
Vfrac. The mass m of a particled cell is a function of the fractal-related decrease of
V0 −
the volume of the ball:

∝

m

1)eν>1

(eν −
1) the gain in dimensionality given by
where (e) is the Bouligand exponent, and (eν −
the fractal iteration; the index ν at the Bouligand exponent speciﬁes the possible fractal
concavities aﬀecting the particled ball [13]. The moment of junction allows the formaliza-
tion of the topological characteristics of what is called motion in a physical universe. It is
the motion that was called by de Broglie as the major characteristic determining physics.
While an identity mapping denotes an absence of motion, that is a null interval of time, a
nonempty moment of junction stands for the minimal of any time interval. In our sense,
there is any minimal spatial “point” at all: only instants that at bottom of fact do not
reﬂect timely features.

(35)

Now let us consider the motion of a particled cell in the tessellattice. Clearly the
massive particled cell cannot move without contacts with ambient cells. Such interaction
creates excitations in the tessellattice called inertons [15,16], because the excitations carry
inert properties of the particle and they represent a substructure of the particle’s matter
waves. As has been shown [15,16] inertons spread from the particle up to a distance

1
V part ·

Λ = λ c/υ

(36)

where λ can be called the free path length of the particle, or the particle’s spatial amplitude,
υ is the particle’s velocity and c is the velocity of inertons, which may be associated with
the speed of light (if we deal with the charged system). Then Λ plays the role of the free
path length of the particle’s cloud of inertons.

A detailed theory of submicroscopic mechanics developed in the real physical space
has been constructed in Refs.
[15-19]. The theory has allowed us to complete clarify
fundamental notions of quantum physics; the theory has introduced short-range action
that automatically means the introduction of a new kind of carriers - inertons, - which
thus become carriers of the quantum mechanical interaction.

It has been argued that a deformation coat, or a crystallite, is formed around a created
particle in the tessellattice space. The size of the crystallite in which cells are deformed
is associated with the Compton wavelength of the particle λCom = h/mc the role of the
crystallite is to shield the particle from the degenerate space. The mechanics constructed

The Euler-Lagrange equations written for the particle and inertons allow one to obtain
paths of the particle and its inertons [15-17]. The solutions to the equations of motion
show that the particle oscillates along its path, namely, the particle’s velocity changes
periodically from υ0 to zero during a spatial interval λ, which exactly coincides with the
de Broglie wavelength of the particle. Thus the value of λ = h/(mυ 0) determines the
spatial period of the oscillatory moving particle.

Furthermore the relationship λ = υ0Θ holds, where hereinafter 1/Θ is the frequency
of scattering of the particle by its inerton cloud. A cloud of inertons oscillates around
the particle and the cloud’s range periodically changes from zero to Λ = cΘ. These two
relationships result in relation (36).

The transition to Schr¨odinger’s and Dirac’s quantum mechanics is ensured by the
p
transition to typical initial classical Hamiltonians, which are used to start the formalisms.
Relationships (40) enable one to derive the Schr¨odinger equation and in this case the wave
ψ-function, which is an abstract characteristic in the conventional formalism, gains in
importance of the ﬁeld of inertia of the particle. The ﬁeld of inertia is located in the range
covered by the amplitude of the particle’s inerton cloud Λ, which signiﬁes that the wave
ψ-function formalism cannot be employed beyond this range limited by the amplitude Λ.
Besides, it is important to emphasize that in the case of a many particle system (for
its de Broglie

instance, a solid) the role of the spatial amplitude λ of a particle, i.e.

12

wavelength, plays the amplitude of oscillations δ g of the particle that vibrates in the
vicinity of its equilibrium position. Below we will use this fact at the analysis of the
behavior of the particle mass in a many particle system.

5.2. Space structure, microscopic mechanics and the
phenomenon of gravity

What exactly do inertons, as carriers of the elementary quantum mechanical inter-
action, transfer? To describe quantum mechanics, we have needed to know the inerton’s
position, velocity, kinetic energy and momentum. In paper [20] a detailed consideration of
the motion of a particle in the tessellattice has been performed. The study has elucidated
processes of emission and re-absorption of inertons, which shows that inertons transfer
fragments of the particle’s mass to the distance Λ from the particle and then the space
tessellattice being elastic returns inertons back to the particle. The value of mass m inert
transferred by an inerton has been studied in Ref.
[21]; it has been argued that m inert
falls within the range around 10−85 to 10−45 kg.

The mass of an inerton is speciﬁed by its own dynamics [20] and, therefore, the La-
grangian (37) should be supplemented by additional terms. Namely, a moving particle and
its inerton cloud metamorphose each half a period, i.e. λ/2 and Λ/2, respectively: The
particled cell and ambient cells involved in the inerton cloud periodically change, due to
the periodic character of the motion of the particle, from the deformed state to the tension
state. In other words, the mass (a local characteristic of the tessellattice) is periodically
converted to the rugosity of the tessellattice (a collective property of cells enfolded in the
inerton cloud). Therefore, keeping in mind that the availability of the mass in a particle
means the total mass of the particle jointly with its inerton cloud, the mass part of the
particle’s Lagrangian becomes

particle + inerton
-system; ~ξ = ~ξ (~r, t) is the current dimensionless value of the rugosity of the tessel-

}
lattice in the range covered by the system. Geometrically the rugosity ~ξ depicts the state
in which the tessellattice cells in the region covered by the inerton cloud do not have any
volumetric deformation (i.e. the cells become massless), but are slightly shifted from their
equilibrium positions in the tessellattice along the particle vector velocity ~υ. This charac-
teristic, the rugosity, also embraces the state of inﬂation of cells, especially the particled
cell. The moving particle periodically changes its state from deformed (the mass state) to
inﬂated and shifted (the tension state); this conversion occurs after the passing the section
λ/2 beginning with the initial starting point that has to be speciﬁed by the mass state.
In physical language, the rugosity manifests itself as the tension of space. The last term
in expression (41) introduces the conversion of the mass state to the tension state where
c is the rate of this conversion, i.e. the velocity of inertons.

Proceeding to the Euler-Lagrange equations for variables µ and ~ξ we have to use them

5.3. The mass of a particle in a many particle system

So far we have treated the behavior of a stationary moving quantum system. However,
if the system in question consists of a huge number of particles (e.g. a gas, a solid and
so on), the Lagrangians (37) and (41) must be complemented by terms including the
interaction between particles. Let us focus on the modiﬁed Lagrangian (41), which should

14

arrive us exactly at the changes in the behavior of the system’s mass revealed at the
aforementioned thermodynamic analysis,

(53) becomes similar to expression (44), namely

of the particle oscillation and the corresponding wave vector and the cyclic frequency as

Here we designated k~n = π/2Λ~n and ω~n = π/2Θ~n.

Thus equations (52) and (53) show that the mass of particle induces the mass ﬁeld
m (r, t) in the ambient space, which obeys the law of standing spherical wave (54). This
mass distribution generates the tension of space ξ (r, t), which also adheres the same law
of standing spherical wave (45), though oscillates in the counter-phase.

5.4. An additional mass

Solution (54) shows that the union of particles in a many particle system lowers their
energy, because ~˜ω < ~ω (hereinafter we omit the index ~n). Besides, the mass ﬁeld around
each particle in the system becomes more concentrate. This is obvious from the diﬀerence
between mass amplitudes written for a system’s particle and a free particle

(56)

This is a typical phenomenon known as the defect of mass (especially in the nuclear

physics), though so far the phenomenon has not been studied in such the broad sense.

Let us investigate how the system of particles will behave when external conditions,
namely, thermodynamic parameters, change. Evidently that any alteration in the system’s
parameters aﬀects proper particle parameters, such as the value of the particle velocity
υ, the spatial amplitude of the velocity oscillation (the de Broglie wavelength) λ and the
amplitude of the particle’s inerton cloud Λ. The three given parameters are concerned
with the period of the particle oscillation Θ [15-17]:

Θ = Λ/c = λ/υ.

(57)

At the same time it is this characteristic Θ that enters expression (56). This automat-
ically means that any change in thermodynamic parameters will immediately change υ, λ
and Λ, which in turn must inﬂuence the value of Θ in the solution for the mass distribution
(55). Therefore, the change between two equilibrium states of thermodynamic parameters
signiﬁes the appearance of the diﬀerence in the value of mass amplitude of the particle’s
inerton cloud, which for states 1 and 2 can be written as (when the inequality K1 r

Thus the value of mass, which is carried by inertons from the particle’s inerton cloud

values to this parameter are the following: υ(initial)

conditions and υ(equilib)
= 66 m/s at the equilibrium temperature 313 K. Therefore, the

Although χ is a ﬁtting parameter, we can evaluate it as well. Indeed, in the Lagrangian

exchange by local deformations and tensions of space. In the system of identical particles,
which is treated, the frequency 1/Θ can be called fundamental and hence one can expect
that χ
1/Θ. Since particles in the system
are speciﬁed by velocities υ and c, we may suggest that the following combination exactly

6. A system of particles in an external
dynamic mass ﬁeld

6.1. The behavior of the particle mass

If the system of particles under consideration falls within an external mass ﬁeld, the
Lagrangian (48) must be supplemented by one more term that describes the interaction of
the ﬁeld with masses inside the system. What can produce such mass ﬁeld? In paper [20]
this question has been discussed in detail: A moving object induces its own inerton ﬁeld
in the ambient space, which transfers mass, and hence a test material object (a particle, or
a system of particles) must undergoes the inﬂuence of this inerton (mass) ﬁeld. Evidently

17

the term of interaction should be written by analogy with the last term in the Lagrangian
(48), namely, the given Lagrangian is supplemented by the term

6.2. A speciﬁc example, quantum mechanics and
simulation

It is interesting to examine how the increase in the particle mass can be treated in the
framework of the orthodox quantum mechanical approach. Let us simulate the behavior
of the aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide aﬀected by a technology developed in 1986,
called Teslar, a tiny chip inserted into a quartz wrist-watch; this Teslar chip has recently
been studied by the Krasnoholovets’ research team [22].

The Teslar wristwatch developed 18 years ago is a special chip, which neutralizes two
currents (or cancels out two ﬂows of electromagnetic ﬁeld), and generates a low frequency
scalar wave due to this reaction of neutralization. That was the hypothesis of the authors
of the invention. The hypothesis was tested in a number of ways in the late 1980s, including
using in-vitro analysis of rat nerve cells and human immune cells, in which noradrenaline
uptake into nerve cells was inhibited by as much as 19.5% more than in controls and
lymphocyte proliferation increased by as much as 76% over controls [23,24]. Additional
reports - using electro-dermal screening procedures, which measure the conductivity of
acupuncture points, - suggested that when a Teslar watch is worn on the left wrist there
are dramatic improvements in the energy level readings of most organs [25]. Because of
such reports and the desire to further understand the physics of the Teslar technology,
additional scientiﬁc studies have been commissioned.

In Figure 1 we show typical infrared spectra recorded from aqueous solution of hydro-
gen peroxide. The spectra demonstrate that the Teslar watch suppresses the vibration of
molecules in the solution under consideration and, in particular, strongly freezes vibrations
of O-H bonds, which is especially seen in the vicinity of the maximum 3400 cm−1. We

(lower curve): the sample was aﬀected by the Teslar watch.

suppose that the Teslar chip can strongly aﬀect a signiﬁcantly non-equilibrium system and
the hydrogen bond is a good marker for the observation of changes in the system studied.
From the viewpoint of the theory sated above we may conclude that the solution
acquires an additional mass radiated by the Teslar watch. However, the means of con-
ventional quantum mechanics do not allow any similar explanation. What exactly can
quantum mechanics propose?

The behavior of a quantum system obeys the Schr¨odinger equation, which in our case

can be written as follows

O-H bonding.

Figure 3 shows the feature of the absolute value of wave function of that hydrogen

atom after being irradiated by the infrared beam from FTIR.

The wave function of hydrogen atom vibrates right and left absorbing the infrared
energy. However, when turning on the Teslar watch, the wave is broken in pieces and
the vibration nearly stops due to the eﬀect of inerton absorption as shown in Figure 4.
The absorption of inertons can be modulated in quantum mechanics by introducing of the
potential V in equation (65) in the form similar to the Newton’s one,

V (x, t) =

cos (Ω t) .

(67)

There have been the following choices and parameters that have been tuned in our
simulator: 1) Rep. No. is the number of iterations of the discretized Schr¨odinger equation;
2) IR.p is the wave length of irradiated IR (the resonant wave length is around 300); I.pot
is the amplitude of additional potential brought by inertons. It corresponds to the α in
our equation with the multiplier: 50,000, for example, the 5,000 for I.pot is equivalent to
0.1 for α; 3) I.delta is the coeﬃcient that is used for modifying the additional term in our
equation (65) as

to avoid the singularity on x = 0; 4) J.pot (oﬀ/on) allow us to consider the eﬀect of
another O-H bonding. If J.pot is on, the distance of these two O-H bonding is turned
with the parameter “another .H”; 5) FTIR (oﬀ/on) allow us to treat whether FTIR is on
or oﬀ.

As another possibility, we may try to simulate the eﬀect of hydrogen bonding between
two water molecules. This time the potential has two valleys caused from two diﬀerent

20

O-H bonding as shown in Figure 5. In this case the feature of vibration of hydrogen atom
is almost the same as the case without considering the other O-H bonding shown in Figure
3. However when reducing the distance between two valleys, i.e. making closer two water
molecules, the wave has broken in pieces and the vibration of wave function of hydrogen
atom has ceased as shown in Figure 6. This means that O-H bonding no longer absorbs
the energy from IR.

Thus the simulation of quantum mechanical problem by a classical scheme gives an
information only on the behavior of ψ function and does not clarify the reasons for the
potential V that remains pure classical in non-deterministic quantum equation (65). The
submicroscopic concept allows us to account for the origin of the potential V and gives a
deeper analysis of the problem.

7. Concluding remarks

As many scientists who have dealt with thermodynamics, we have often had the
impression that thermodynamics is easier to use than to understand. In such a situation,
it is of real comfort to discover in books written by other scientists that they have felt
the same impression. While two of these books only have been referenced herein, Refs.
[3,4], we would like to express our gratitude to all the authors who have transmitted such
a message, which is indubitably of great scientiﬁc interest.

In the present paper, by means of both conventional thermodynamic methods and the
submicroscopic analysis, we have shown that the change in mass is a general law of evolu-
tion of physical systems. The mass exchange is the fundamental property of any physical
system, from a system of several canonical particles to that of cosmological objects. Hith-

nuclear physics. However, the present research points to the necessity of including the
phenomenon of the defect of mass also in tasks typical for condensed matter physics. Be-
sides, the submicroscopic consideration has allowed us to give an estimation of the speed of
inertons, carriers of quantum mechanical and gravitational interactions of objects, which
has been evaluated as about 2.5

Abstract

It took two millennia after Euclid and until in the early 1880s, when
we went beyond the ancient axiom of parallels, and inaugurated ge-
In less than one more century, General
ometries of curved spaces.
Relativity followed. At present, physical thinking is still beheld by
the yet deeper and equally ancient Archimedean assumption which
entraps us into the limited view of ”only one walkable world”. In view
of that, it is argued with some rather easily accessible mathematical
support that Theoretical Physics may at last venture into the Non-
Archimedean realms.

1. A Deep Expression of a Need for Reconsideration

String Theory has for the last nearly three decades known a special
status within Theoretical Physics in the pursuit of the grand uniﬁ-
cation between General Relativity and Quantum Theory. Recently
however, it has become the object of a considerable criticism due to
a number of reasons which in times to come may, or for that matter,
may not turn out to be fully valid.

1

Be it as it may, even in case String Theory ends up side lined for some
time to come, or possibly for good, it is important not to throw away
with it those of the more fundamental novel ideas which it managed
to bring to the forefront of thinking in Theoretical Physics, ideas that
may actually express a deeper and more generally valid need for recon-
sideration in the realms of our most fundamental physical intuitions,
meanings and concepts.

Two such possible novel ideas worth retaining are the following :

•

•

seeing space-time as involving a number of dimensions quite be-
yond the usual four space-time ones,

seeing the simplest primary elements of space-time not as mere
dimensionless points, but rather, as entities with a certain struc-
ture.

Remarkably, the second idea above had been familiar in Mathematics,
namely, in Topology, prior to String Theory. It is what rather whim-
sically is called pointless topology, or more appropriately, point-free
topology, see the early survey [1], with references going back into the
1960s.

As for the ﬁrst above idea, that as well had been suggested in Physics,
Indeed, as far back as in the early 1920s,
prior to String Theory.
Kaluza-Klein put forward a ﬁve dimensional version of General Rel-
ativity. Following that, still higher dimensional versions of General
Relativity were proposed.

In this paper, related to the above two ideas - and at the same time,
going beyond them in ways that have so far mostly escaped the in-
tuition or interest of physicists - we shall draw attention upon, and
argue the possible appropriateness of considering non-Archimedean
structures for space-time, see Appendix 1 for the respective deﬁnition.

Here it should be noted that in Theoretical Physics there have been
occasional suggestions for a reconsideration of our usual perceptions
and conceptions of space-time, and speciﬁcally, of its Mathematical
modelling, be it geometric, algebraic, topological, and so on.

2

Interestingly enough, String Theory itself gave importance to what
has lately been called Non-Commutative Geometry.
And on yet more basic and simple levels, it has been suggested in The-
oretical Physics that the scalars given by the usual ﬁeld R of real num-
bers, scalars upon which the ﬁeld C of complex numbers itself is built,
should be replaced by other sets of scalars, some of such scalars having
a multiplication which is non-commutative, or even non-associative,
see [6-9] and the references cited there.
In fact, connected with Quantum Field Theory, there have been sug-
gestions coming from theoretical physicists, [4], for using N-Category
Theory, which is a most involved extension of Category Theory intro-
duced in Mathematics in the 1940s, the latter itself being already on
such a level of abstraction as to be beyond the present interest of most
so called working mathematicians.

A most remarkable latest program for a deep reconsideration of the
foundations of Theoretical Physics has just been published in [1]. Here
we cite some of its introductory arguments which could hardly be
expressed better :

”A striking feature of the various current programmes for
quantising gravity including superstring theory and loop
quantum gravityis that, notwithstanding their disparate
views on the nature of space and time, they almost all use
more-or-less standard quantum theory. Although under-
standable from a pragmatic viewpoint (since all we have
is more-or-less standard quantum theory) this situation is
nevertheless questionable when viewed from a wider per-
spective. Indeed, there has always been a school of thought
asserting that quantum theory itself needs to be radically
changed/developed before it can be used in a fully coher-
ent quantum theory of gravity. This iconoclastic stance has
several roots, of which, for us, the most important is the
use in the standard quantum formalism of certain critical
mathematical ingredients that are taken for granted and
yet which, we claim, implicitly assume certain properties
of space and time. Such an a priori imposition of spatio-
temporal concepts would be a major error if they turn out
to be fundamentally incompatible with what is needed for

3

a theory of quantum gravity. A prime example is the use
of the continuum which, in this context, means the real
and/or complex numbers. These are a central ingredient
in all the various mathematical frameworks in which quan-
tum theory is commonly discussed. For example, this is
clearly so with the use of (i) Hilbert spaces and operators;
(ii) geometric quantisation; (iii) probability functions on a
non-distributive quantum logic; (iv) deformation quantisa-
tion; and (v) formal (i.e., mathematically ill-deﬁned) path
integrals and the like. The a priori imposition of such
continuum concepts could be radically incompatible with
a quantum gravity formalism in which, say, space-time is
fundamentally discrete: as, for example, in the causal set
programme.”

What however appears to have avoided the intuition, awareness or
interest of physicists is the use of non-Archimedean space-time struc-
tures. And as argued in [9], the fact that, mostly by an omission or
default, the mathematical models used in Theoretical Physics have
been conﬁned to those which happen to be given by Archimedean
structures, has led to an entrapment into a so called ”one single walk-
able world”, see section 2.4., and entrapment which no one seems to
be aware of in Theoretical Physics.
In particular, it is tacitly accepted that time, for instance, extends at
most only as far as - but by no means beyond - the realms described by
the interval of usual real numbers from
, that is, as given
by the real line R. And such a view of the ranges of all possible time
is taken for granted in Classical Mechanics, Relativity and Quantum
Theory as well.
By the same token, it is accepted that in Classical Mechanics and
Special Relativity there is simply no - and there can never be any -
space whatsoever beyond that which is described by R

to +

−∞

∞

3.

To a certain extent, such tacit and rather universal assumptions have
an historical explanation - however, not necessarily and excuse as well
- in the fact that the ﬁeld R of real numbers is the only ﬁeld which is
linearly ordered, complete, and Archimedean. And at the beginnings
of ancient Mathematics, and speciﬁcally Geometry, there was obvi-

4

ously no use in any non-Archimedean structures.

Certainly, at its ancient origins, Mathematics was conﬁned to the
realms directly accessible to our human senses, that is the realms of
the physical, and speciﬁcally the visible and the palpable. And quan-
titative measurement of various objects, and also of land, was among
its main concerns and applications. In such a context, no doubt, the
Archimedean assumption had to arise. After all, without it, there
would not be any possibility to choose a unit measure, and then mea-
sure by its integer and fractional multiples the visible and palpable
entities under consideration.

Remarkably, ever since ancient times and till recently, the Archimedean
assumption has never been questioned even in Mathematics, let alone
in Physics. On the contrary, it went on and on as an assumption on
a level still deeper than those formulated explicitly as various self-
evident axioms.
It is therefore not so surprising that Theoretical Physics still treats
the Archimedean assumption precisely in the same manner.

In this regard, it is rather poignant to recall the development of the
views related to the ancient axiom of parallels.
Until the early 1800s, no one ever questioned the veracity of that
axiom. On the contrary, it was assumed to be true, and all eﬀorts were
directed towards proving it from the other axioms. Indeed, the only
concern about the axiom of parallels was caused by the fact that, when
compared with the other axioms of Geometry, it seemed somewhat
complex, and also, it involved the concept of inﬁnity, a concept not
directly accessible to our human senses. Thus it was the common
perception that the axiom of parallels could not so easily be classiﬁed
along the other axioms as self-evident.
And until the early 1800s, that was an obvious matter of concern,
since it was taken for granted that :

”Axioms can only and only be self-evident statements.

Here in this last statement itself we can see once again a clear and rel-
evant example of the crucial importance of certain axioms which are
accepted on a deeper, and less than conscious level. Let us call them

5

for convenience deep axioms. And as it often happens, such deep ax-
ioms can easily play a more important role than the usual ones which
we are consciously and explicitly formulated and accepted.

And how deep the axiom of parallels managed to penetrate in human
awareness is illustrated by the fact that not long before the discovery
of non-Euclidean Geometries in which that axiom does no longer hold,
such a remarkable philosopher like Immanuel Kant, distinguished with
an incisive critical sense, kept considering Euclidean Geometry, and
thus the axiom of parallels, as nothing short of being an a priori truth,
therefore being the only possible Geometry.

Fortunately, in the early 1800s, the axiom of parallels was proved
to be independent of the other axioms of Geometry. Furthermore,
two diﬀerent versions of that axiom could clearly be formulated, thus
leading to two non-Euclidean Geometries.
Needless to say, without that discovery, General Relativity, which got
discovered in less than one more century, could not have come about.
And so it came to pass that within a few generations, the questioning
of the axiom of parallels opened the way to such a revolution in The-
oretical Physics, as that brought about by General Relativity.

Yet, today, the Archimedean assumption still keeps physicists en-
thralled ...
Enthralled by, and also entrapped into ”one single walkable world”
which it inevitably imposes ...
And the resulting limitations, of which no one seems to be aware of
in Theoretical Physics, can be tremendous. For instance, in a non-
Archimedean space-time structure the very concept of quantum, as
well as the ﬁnite upper limit on possible velocities cannot but acquire
completely new meanings, and possibly, even new formulations or al-
ternatives ...

However, several modern facts of a rather historic proportion in them-
selves, should have by now drawn attention upon our entrapment into
”one single walkable world” with its Archimedean limitations. Among
these facts is the following one :

6

Back in 1966, Abraham Robinson introduced Nonstandard Analysis.
His reason was mainly to place on a rigorous footing the ”inﬁnitesi-
mals” used by Leibniz in Calculus, in the late 1600s. However, the
point of importance here in Robinson’s construction of the ﬁeld ∗R
of nonstandard reals is the non-Archimedean nature of that ﬁeld,
a property which must of course follow from the uniqueness of the
Archimedean ﬁeld R of real numbers mentioned above.

To this crucial fact, and being by no means less important, one can
add the most intriguing question raised in [5], which can brieﬂy be
formulated as follows :

How come that all spaces used so far in Theoretical Physics
have as sets a cardinal not larger than that of the contin-
uum, that is, of the real numbers R ?

And the relevance of this question is in the fact that, ever since Can-
tor’s Set Theory, introduced in the late 1800s, we know about sets
with cardinality incomparably larger that of the continuum. Further-
more, the cardinal of the continuum is very low among the inﬁnite
cardinals. In fact, it is merely the second one, namely, after that of
the cardinal of the set N of nonnegative integers, if one accepts the
Continuum Hypothesis.

However, what may be no less important an argument than those
above for the need of a reconsideration of the Archimedean mathemat-
ical structures used in Theoretical Physics are the surprising and so
far not yet explored rich opportunities opened up by non-Archimedean
structures.

A well developed example about the actual beneﬁts of such consider-
able opportunities is given, among others, by the Nonlinear Algebraic
Theory of Generalized Solution for large classes of nonlinear partial
diﬀerential equations, a theory originated in the early 1960s, and by
now listed by the American Mathematical Society in their Subject
Classiﬁcation, under 46F30, see :

www.ams.org/msc/46Fxx.html

7

Some of the relevant such applications of non-Archimedean structures,
and not only in the solution of partial diﬀerential equations, can be
found in [10-33], and in the references cited there.

Returning to [5], my general appreciation of it, expressed succinctly
and without much detail, can be found in Appendix 2 which was sent
for publication to The Mathematical Intelligencer.
Regardless of that view, however, one can note that [5] does not give
any attention to the issue of Archimedean versus non-Archimedean
structures, and instead, and merely by default, takes the traditional
Archimedean view for granted.

Recently, related to Quantum Gravity, so called background free the-
oretical models have been suggested.
As it happens, however, such models are still entrapped into the ”one
single walkable world” situation, even if they see themselves free from
any usual Geometry, Algebra or Topology. And this entrapment can
only one again show how deep some deep axioms can indeed condition
one’s whole vision and thinking, even if such deep axioms are by then
present only by their, so to say, ghosts ...

The ancient axiom of parallels created a long ongoing controversy
which got only solved in the early 1880s.
And this solution, in less than one more century, opened the way to
General Relativity.

On the other hand, the Archimedean assumption has so far hardly
brought with it any comparable controversy. And certainly not in
Theoretical Physics ...
And as things so often go with us humans : no controversy means no
consideration, let alone reconsideration ...
Thus in Theoretical Physics we remain trapped for evermore into the
Archimedean assumption and the corresponding ”one single walkable
world” which it imposes ...

Going beyond the ancient axiom of parallels was, no doubt, absolutely
necessary for being able to conceive of and achieve General Relativity.
Fortunately, once the transition beyond that ancient axiom happened,

8

in less than one more century, it also proved to be suﬃcient for that
truly revolutionary success in Theoretical Physics to occur.

Nowadays, it is perhaps the time to go beyond the yet deeper ancient
Archimedean assumption, and at long last, liberate physical thinking
from the limitations of the consequent ”one single walkable world” ...

2. Universes within Universes, Universes next to Universes ...

We shall brieﬂy illustrate here the surprising wealth of structure the
non-Archimedean property can bring with itself. A few further details
in this regard can be found in [9].

2.1. A simple basic one dimensional and linearly ordered

example

For simplicity, we start with one of the most relevant non-Archimedean
ﬁelds which extend the usual scalar ﬁeld R of real numbers, namely,
the ﬁeld ∗R of nonstandard real numbers, introduced by Robinson in
the 1960s. And to make more user friendly the presentation of the
facts important here - namely, the surprising richness of the respective
non-Archimedean structure - we shall recall the corresponding results
without proof, since as is well known, such proofs, presented for in-
stance in [3], can be technically rather involved, as it is typical for
Nonstandard Analysis.

Let us therefore see

•

•

what are the diﬀerences between the Archimedean ﬁeld of usual
real scalars in R, and on the other hand, their non-Archimedean
ﬁeld extension given by ∗R ?

how much more rich is the structure of ∗R, when compared with
that of R ?

As we shall see in the sequel, going from R to the much larger ∗R
involves two expansions, namely, a local one, at each point r
R, as

∈

9

well as a global one, at both inﬁnite ends of the real line R.

A particularly useful way to illustrate it, [3], is by saying that, when
we want to go from R to ∗R, we need two special instruments which
can give us views outside of R, and into the not yet seen, and not yet
known worlds situated within ∗R beyond the conﬁnes of the standard
realm of the real line R. Namely, we need

a so called microscope in order to see the monads which give the
new and additional local structure in ∗R, and we also need

a so called telescope for being able to look at galaxies giving the
new and additional global structure in ∗R.

In order to understand the structure of ∗R, the following three things
are therefore enough :

to keep in mind that ∗R is a linearly ordered non-Archimedean
ﬁeld,

to understand how the monads create the local structure of ∗
R,
and in this respect, it is enough to understand how they create
the local structure of the galaxy of 0
R, which can be seen as
the central galaxy,

∈

to understand how by uncountably many translations to the
right and left, the galaxy of 0
R, that is, the central galaxy,
∈
creates the global structure of ∗R.

Anticipating and simplifying a more precise description which follows
in the sequel, the way ∗
R is obtained from R is in summary by the
next procedure :

R. This also goes of course for each mon(r), with r

And now, let us make the above more precise by giving some informa-

As follows easily in Nonstandard Analysis, [3], none of the above sets of
monads and galaxies is void, and in fact, each of them is uncountably
large. Furthermore, as seen in the sequel, both monads and galaxies
have surprisingly complex structures which in a way reﬂect one an-
other, and in addition, each of them is self-similar, recalling one of
the well known basic properties of fractal structures.

Now we recall that

The use of the term monad by Robinson was, as mentioned, inspired
by Leibniz who ﬁrst employed inﬁnitesimals and did so in surprisingly
eﬀective manner, even if in a merely intuitive and insuﬃciently rigor-
ous manner when, parallel with and independently of Newton, started
the development of Calculus in the late 1600s. In this regard the fact
that

mon(0)

R =

0

{

}

T

which means that zero is the only real number which is inﬁnitesimal,
caused, starting with Leibniz, all sort of diﬃculties when, prior to the
creation of modern Nonstandard Analysis, one tried to deal with in-
ﬁnitesimals. Similarly, the fact that

∗R

\

Gal(0)

is the set of inﬁnite numbers in ∗R, thus there are no reals numbers
which are inﬁnite, brought with it diﬃculties when dealing with in-
ﬁnitely large numbers, prior to the modern theory of Nonstandard
Analysis.

2.2. Global and local structure of ∗R

The structure of Gal(0), both locally and globally, is presented in (2.3).
In view of (2.8), that also gives an understanding of the local structure
of ∗R.

For the understanding of the global structure of ∗R we have the order
reversing bijective mapping between inﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal numbers
in ∗R, namely

Gal(0), then

⇐⇒

This fact is fundamental, as it shows that the local structure of ∗R
mirrors its global structure, and vice versa.

It also establishes the link between Keisler’s microscope and telescope,
the former letting us see into mon(0), while the latter allowing us to
look out into ∗

Gal(0).

R

\

In this regard, the properties (2.1) - (2.7) express the local structure of
∗R, more precisely, within its part given by Gal(0), that is, the struc-
ture of the ﬁnite numbers in ∗R. This local structure consists of a sort
of inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood around every usual real number r
R,
neighbourhood given by the translate mon(r) = r + mon(0) of
mon(0). And in view of (2.1), this local structure cannot be seen from
R, thus we have to use Keisler’s microscope.

∈

2.3 Self-Similarity in ∗R

The local and global structures of ∗R, as we have seen in subsection
2.2, are closely related, as they are expressed in (2.3), (2.8) and (2.9).

Here we shall point to a self-similar aspect of this interrelation which
may remind us of a typical feature of fractals.

In this regard, we recall that the global structure of ∗R is given by,
see (2.8)

∗R =

λ ∈ Λ Gal(

sλ)

Gal(0)

λ ∈ Λ Gal(sλ)

S

S

S

−

while its local structure is described by, see (2.9)

Gal(0) =

r∈R ( r + mon(0) )

S

In this way we obtain the self-similar order reversing bijections, which
are expressed in terms of mon(0), namely

15

(2.10)

[

r∈R, λ∈Λ (r

sλ + mon(0)) ]

r∈R, λ∈Λ(r + sλ + mon(0)) ]

−

[

∪

r∈R, λ∈Λ (r

r∈R, λ∈Λ(r + sλ + mon(0)) ]

As we can note, the above bijections in (2.10), (2.11) are given by the
1/s
very simple algebraic, explicit, and order reversing mapping s
which involves what is essentially a ﬁeld operation, namely, division.
And these two bijections take the place of the much simpler order re-
versing bijections in the case of the usual real line R, namely

The considerable diﬀerence between (2.10), (2.11), and on the other
hand, (2.12), (2.13) is obvious. In the former two, which describe the
structure of ∗

R, the order reversing bijections represent the set

mon(0)

\ {

}

through the set

[

r∈R, λ∈Λ (r

sλ + mon(0)) ]

r∈R, λ∈Λ(r + sλ + mon(0)) ]

S

−

which contains uncountably many translates of the set mon(0). And
it is precisely this manifestly involved self-similarity of the set mon(0)

[

∪

S

16

of monads which is the novelty in the non-Archimedean structure of
∗R, when compared with the much simpler Archimedean structure of
R. This novelty is remarkable since it makes mon(0) having the same
complexity with

∗R

\

Gal(0) =

= [

r∈R, λ∈Λ (r

sλ +mon(0)) ]

r∈R, λ∈Λ(r +sλ +mon(0)) ]

S

−

[

∪

S

In this way mon(0), which is but the realm of inﬁnitesimals, thus it
cannot be seen in terms of R, except with Keisler’s microscope, has
the very same complexity as the set ∗R
Gal(0) of all inﬁnitely large
numbers, which again cannot be seen from R, unless Keisler’s tele-
scope is used.

2.4. Walkable worlds ...

The local and global nature of a non-Archimedean structure can be
illustrated in a more intuitively accessible and geometric manner, the
manner which in ancient times was quite likely the one taken in view
of its obvious everyday practicality. And to keep things simple, we re-
main for a while longer with the nonstandard extension ∗R of the real
line R. Indeed, ∗R is a highly relevant instance of a non-Archimedean
structure, thus it is in this regard essentially diﬀerent from R which is
Archimedean. On the other hand, both ∗R and R have the simplicity
of being one dimensional.

Given now any usual real number u
appears to be an eminently practical question, namely :

R, u > 0, let as ask what

∈

How far along the one dimensional world of ∗R can one
walk from any given point r
R by taking an arbitrary

∈

17

large ﬁnite number of steps of size u, be it in the positive
or negative directions ?

The answer given by Nonstandard Analysis is

(2.14) Gal(0)

Needless to say, in view of (2.8), this kind of walk conﬁnes us to an
utterly small part of ∗
R. Namely, as follows from (2.3), Gal(0) only
contains the usual real line R and the monads around each real num-
R, thus the inﬁnitesimal neighbourhoods of such numbers r.
ber r
Consequently, Gal(0) does not contain any of the inﬁnite numbers in
∗R.

∈

And as is so far mostly the case, it is precisely this limited world which
is the one dimensional world of Theoretical Physics. And in fact it
is even less, since it is only its strict subset given by the real line R,
and without any of the monads which make up the diﬀerence between
Gal(0) and the smaller R, see (2.3). Indeed, this is the

”only one walkable world”

within which the mathematical modelling of Physics tends to be con-
ﬁned ...

And then, let us see

How many other, and even more importantly, what kind of
other ”walkable worlds” can the non-Archimedean struc-
ture of ∗R oﬀer us ?

And here may quite likely be a novel and richly promising opportunity
to be made use of at last in Theoretical Physics.

The answer to the above general question is very simple. We take an
∗R, u > 0 and an arbitrary starting point
arbitrary step length u
∗R, and denote by
s

∈

∈

18

(2.15) W Wu, s

that part of ∗R which can be reached from s by walking any ﬁnite
number of steps, each of the given length u, and do so either in the
positive, or in the negative direction. We call W Wu, s the ”walkable
world” from s and with steps u.

To be more precise mathematically, any given t

An immediate consequence is that

(2.17)

all ”walkable worlds” are order isomorphic with Gal(0)

Indeed, with the above notation, let us deﬁne the mapping ω by

W Wu, s ∋

ω(t) = (t

then ω is obviously injective and strictly increasing, while (2.16∗) im-

Clearly therefore :

(2.18)

A ”walkable world” cannot have a smallest or
a largest element.

Another immediate consequence is the following self-conﬁnement prop-
erty of such ”walkable worlds”, namely

(2.19)

t

∈

∀

W Wu, s : W Wu, t = W Wu, s

19

In other words, one can never leave, or get out of a ”walkable world”
W Wu, s , no matter at what point t in it one would start walking, and
doing so with steps of the same length u, or for that matter, with steps
of any length u ′ = cu, where c > 0 is ﬁnite.

In particular it follows that, see (2.14)

(2.20)

∀

which, in the case of one dimension, contains what is so far the typical
”only one walkable world” in Theoretical Physics ...

2.5. How are the walkable worlds situated with respect to

one another ?

The answer to this question is obtained easily. Suppose given two
∗R, u,
”walkable worlds” W Wu, s and W Wu ′, s ′, with u, u ′, s, s ′
u ′ > 0, and let us assume that these two ”walkable worlds” are not
disjoint, namely

∈

(2.21) W Wu, s

W Wu ′, s ′

= φ

Thus we can take a point

W Wu, s

W Wu ′, s ′

∈

T

and then in view of (2.16∗), for suitable n, n ′
obtain the inequalities

which imply that

−

≤

s ′ + n ′u ′,

−

Now since ∗R is linearly ordered, we can assume without loss of gen-
erality that

20

and then the ﬁrst inequality in (2.22) gives

s

≤

s ′ + nu + n ′u ′

s ′ + (n + n ′)u ′

≤

hence s

W Wu ′, s ′, which in view of (2.23) means that

∈
(2.24) W Wu, s ⊆
In this way, we proved that :

W Wu ′, s ′

(2.25)

Two ”walkable worlds” are either disjoint,
or one contains the other.

The remarkable fact, however, is that :

There are uncountably many pairwise
disjoint ”walkable worlds”. And between
any two disjoint ”walkable worlds” there
are uncountably many other ones.

(2.26)

Also :

(2.27)

Non-disjoint ”walkable worlds” are nested
into one another in uncountable chains.

As for the complex manner in which the ”walkable worlds” are sit-
uated outside of one another, or on the contrary, nested within one
another, the self-similarity property of ∗R in subsection 2.3. can oﬀer
further insights.

2.6. The sizes and relative sizes of ”walkable worlds”

In order to give a further idea about the structure of ∗
R, and in par-
ticular, about the sizes and relative sizes of ”walkable worlds”, we
mention the following well known properties of numbers in ∗R.

Correspondingly, given any inﬁnitely large s

Also, given any inﬁnitely large s

Furthermore, given any two numbers v, w

or

N, m

As an eﬀect of the above, we mention a few surprising facts about
”walkable worlds”.

First we recall that the Archimedean assumption, when considered
within one dimension, has ever since ancient times kept us - and still
keeps much of Theoretical Physics - conﬁned within the real line R
which is but a strict subset, see (2.3), (2.20), of the ”walkable world”
given by the central galaxy, namely

(2.29) Gal(0) = W W1, 0

Compared to this ancient ”only one walkable world” however, there
are uncountably many inﬁnitesimal, or for that matter, inﬁnitely large
”walkable worlds”. And on their turn, inﬁnitesimal ”walkable worlds”
can be inﬁnitely large, or for that matter, inﬁnitesimal when compared
with some other inﬁnitesimal ”walkable worlds”. Similarly, inﬁnitely
large ”walkable worlds” can be inﬁnitesimal, or on the contrary, in-

22

ﬁnitely large when compared with some other inﬁnitely large ”walkable
worlds”.
In this regard, the central ”walkable world” (2.29) has only one dis-
tinguishing feature, namely, that it contains both 0 and 1.

Further, let us note that

(2.30) mon(0)

is not a ”walkable world”

although obviously 0

mon(0). Indeed, let us assume that

∈

mon(0) = W Wǫ, η

for a certain ǫ, η
(2.19) gives

∈

∗R, ǫ > 0. But 0

mon(0) = W Wǫ, η , hence

∈

And then in view of (2.16∗), it follows that for every χ
exists n

1, such that

N, n

∈

∗R, there

mon(0) = W Wǫ, 0

≥

∈

nǫ

χ

nǫ

−

≤

≤

which is obviously not true for χ = √ǫ

mon(0).

∈

In view of (2.30) it follows that mon(0) itself, that is, the set of in-
ﬁnitesimals, is far more large and complex than being ”one single
walkable world”. And this is to be expected from its self-similarity
property in (2.10), (2.11).

3. Non-Archimedean structures of higher dimensions

As we have seen, the non-Archimedean nature of ∗
R can already bring
with it a surprisingly novel and rich structure. Needless to say, the
structure of non-Archimedean spaces of higher dimensions can only
be yet more rich and surprising.

23

Such higher, in fact, inﬁnite dimensional non-Archimedean spaces, in
fact algebras of generalized functions, have been successfully used in
solving large classes of earlier unsolved linear and nonlinear partial
diﬀerential equations, see [10-33] and the references cited there.

However, there are far simpler non-Archimedean algebras of scalars
which can have a relevant use in Theoretical Physics as replacements
of the usual Archimedean ﬁelds R or C of real, respectively, complex
scalars, see [6-9] and the references cited there.

What is to note with respect to such non-Archimedean algebras of
scalars is that they are in fact inﬁnite dimensional. This is precisely
why they are non-Archimedean.

On the other hand, their construction is perfectly similar with the
traditional Cauchy-Bolzano construction of the real numbers R. And
consequently, their use does not lead to any additional diﬃculties, ex-
cept for what still happens to be the surprising novelty and richness
of non-Archimedean structures.

The essence of the mentioned traditional construction of the real num-
bers R has been formulated in the 1950s as the reduced power construc-
tion. And it is one of the main instruments in Model Theory, which
is a discipline within Mathematical Logic.
Fortunately, reduced powers can easily be constructed and used with-
out any involvement of Model Theory or Mathematical Logic. And
they have actually been used in this way, for instance, in constructing
the completion of metric, normed, or uniform topological spaces.
Here for convenience, we recall the main features of the construction
of reduced powers, see [6-8] and the references cited there for further
detail.

By the way, as noted earlier, reduced powers were extensively used in
the construction of large classes of algebras of generalized functions,
as well as generalized scalars, both employed in the solution of a large
variety of linear and nonlinear PDEs, see [10-33].

The mentioned large class of algebras of scalars, constructed as re-

24

duced powers, is obtained as follows.

Let K be any algebra, among others the ﬁeld R of real, or alterna-
tively, the ﬁeld C of complex numbers, and let Λ be any inﬁnite set of
indices. Then we consider

(3.1)

Λ
K

which is the set of all functions x : Λ
K, and which is obviously
an algebra with the point-wise operations on such functions. Further-
more, if K is commutative or associative, the same will hold for the
algebra K

Λ.

Λ is that they have zero di-

This issue, however, can be dealt with in the following manner, to the

the construction of the ﬁeld ∗R of nonstandard reals, where one takes

4. What about the Quanta and the Velocity of Light ?

The quantitative aspect of the issue of the quanta and of the velocity of
light has so far made perfect sense within the Archimedean structure
of the real line R, that is, within its ”only one walkable world” view,
being supported by countless physical experiments.
Certainly, within such a view a smallest allowed strictly positive quan-
tity, say, of energy, and in that case called ”energy quantum”, can have
a clear meaning. Indeed, outside of that ”only one walkable world”
there is supposed to be nothing at all. Therefore, that quantum, or
smallest allowed strictly positive quantity - if it really exists - must by
necessity be situated within that very same ”only one walkable world”.
And any number of physical experiments support the existence of such
quanta.
Similar is, of course, the situation with a largest allowed ﬁnite quan-

28

tity, such as for instance the velocity of light.

However, once that ”only one walkable world” is replaced by a non-
Archimedean structure, and in fact, by any non-Archimedean one,
a rather unprecedented richness of structure comes into play due to
the presence of inﬁnitesimals and inﬁnitely large elements, and conse-
quently, of the corresponding structure of ”walkable worlds”.
Consequently, the very meaning of smallest allowed strictly positive
quantity, or alternatively, of largest allowed ﬁnite quantity becomes de-
pendent on the speciﬁc ”walkable world” within which it is considered.
And as seen above even in the simple one dimensional case of ∗R, such
”walkable worlds” are uncountably many, either next to one another,
or nested within one another, all of them in a complex self-similar
In this way, it is no longer so clear within which particu-
pattern.
lar ”walkable worlds” should the traditional concepts of quanta and
velocity of light be considered. Thus such traditional concepts may
possibly need a fundamental reconsideration.

In this regard, here we conclude with a summary for an appropriate
consideration of those of the earlier presented facts in the simplest rel-
evant non-Archimedean case, namely, of the one dimensional ∗
R, facts
which may be relevant for the mentioned possible reconsideration of
quanta and/or velocity of light :

tains the other, see (2.25).

Appendix 1

Basic Algebraic Structures

For convenience, we recall here a few basic concepts from Algebra and
Ordered Structures. The respective concepts are introduced step by
step, culminating with the ones we are interested in, namely, ﬁelds
and algebras, and their Archimedean, respectively, non-Archimedean
instances.

A group is a structure (G, α), where G is a nonvoid set and α : G
G

G is a binary operation on G which is :

The group (G, α) is commutative, if and only if :

In such a case the binary operation α is simply denoted by ”+” and
called addition, namely

α(x, y) = x + y,

Further, the neutral element is denoted by 0, namely, e = 0, while for
every x

G, its inverse x ′ is denoted by

x.

It will be useful to note the following. Given any group element
x

G and any integer number n

G, by

nx =

x + x + x + . . . + x if n

where the respective sum has n terms. The meaning of this operation
is easy to follow. Namely, nx can be seen as n steps of length x each,
in the direction x. This interpretation will be particularly useful in
understanding the condition deﬁning the Archimedean property, and
thus, of the non-Archimedean property as well.

We recall that the usual addition gives a commutative group struc-
ture on the integer numbers Z, rational numbers Q, real numbers R,
complex numbers C, as well as on the set M m, n of m
n matrices,

The Archimedean Property

The Archimedean property, as much as the property of being non-
Archimedean, is essentially related to certain algebraic + order struc-
tures. The simplest way to deal with the issue is to consider ordered
groups. And in fact, we can restrict ourself to commutative groups.

Commutative groups were deﬁned above, therefore, here we brieﬂy
recall the deﬁnition of partial orders.

A partial order
between elements x, y

on a nonvoid set X is a binary relation x

is called a linear order on X.

A partially ordered commutative group is by deﬁnition a commutative

In particular, we have a linearly ordered commutative group when the

It is easy to see that in the general case of partially ordered commuta-

Indeed, this can be seen even in the simplest case of n = 2, if we take
x = (1, 0) and y = (0, 1), since then we do not have either x

Obviously, rings, algebras and ﬁelds each have, as far as their respec-
tive operations of addition are concerned, a commutative group struc-
ture as part of their deﬁnition. And when a partial order is deﬁned
to be compatible with the respective ring, algebra or ﬁeld structure,
it will among other conditions be required to be compatible with the
mentioned commutative group structure of addition.

Consequently, the Archimedean condition on rings, algebras and ﬁelds
can be deﬁned exclusively in terms of the partially ordered commuta-
tive group structure of their respective operations of addition.

Appendix 2

Letter to the Editor of The Mathematical Intelligencer

In the Summer 2006 issue of The Mathematical Intelligencer there are
two reviews of Roger Penrose’s book ”The Road to Reality” published
in 2005. These two reviews recall quite clearly the standard political
ways of two party Anglo-Saxon democratic systems as understood and
trivialized by journals such as Newsweek, or rather, they may simply
recall the ”good cop - bad cop” approach to criminals. One can won-
der whether The Mathematical Intelligencer did that by mistake, or

37

on the contrary, ﬁnds it a matter of pride to try to implant such ap-
proaches into science. And in the less than fortunate latter case, one
can wonder why only two opposing views were presented when com-
menting upon scientiﬁc facts like, say, 1 + 1 = 2 ?
Why not, indeed, three, or even more opposing views ?
After all, why should we not have some sort of circus in such rather
arid realms like mathematics ?

And now back to the mentioned two reviews. The ﬁrst of them is
shorter and quite sparse in detail when it ﬁnds the book under review
highly meritorious and readable.
The second review recalls an old Jewish story which goes as fol-
lows. Somewhere in Medieval Europe, in a place with lingering anti-
Semitism, an old Jew is brought to a court of law. Before sentencing,
the judge allows the poor man to make a last statement, and this is
what he has to say : Your Honour, I only whish I were judged by you
as your predecessor did. Yes, when it came to sentencing, he said ”He
is a Jew, but he is innocent”. And now, I am afraid, Your Honour
may say ”He is innocent, but he is a Jew” . . .
Well, the second review does ﬁnd quite a number of outstanding fea-
tures in Penrose’s latest book, but all of that is totally and hopelessly
drowned in a manifestly vicious overall prejudiced attitude and judge-
ment.
One can only wonder how a third, or perhaps, fourth and so on, review
might have looked, had The Mathematical Intelligencer decided to do
one better than the trivial Newsweek approach, and present us more
than merely the rock bottom two sharply opposing views . . .

And now, may I myself make a brief comment on Penrose’s mentioned
book, and start by noting that, as it happens, I myself have had some
conﬂicting arguments with him on certain strictly mathematical issue,
thus I cannot be counted as one of his unconditional admirers.
First, and above all, the subject of Penrose’s latest book is by far the
most fundamental and consequential within the sciences of the last
few centuries of our modern times.
Second, the way science is pursued for more than half a century by
now, scholarship, and even more so a wide ranging and deeply reach-
ing one, is massively discouraged, in favour of narrowly specialized

38

research production. Penrose happens to be one of the very few schol-
ars, if not in fact the only one nowadays, with a truly impressive depth
and breadth in the subject. And in addition to having himself signiﬁ-
cant research contributions, he has clearly been one of the rather rare
breed of distinguished ”thinking scientists”, and not merely one of the
many many merely ”working” ones. Consequently, even if his latest
book were rather poor, which clearly it is very far from being, one
should nevertheless have an extraordinary appreciation for his schol-
arship and willingness to make the considerable eﬀort to bring that
scholarship into the public domain.
In this regard it important to
point out that it shows a very poor understanding on the part of any
reviewer or reader to see Penrose’s latest book as a science popular-
ization one.
Indeed, the kind of science it covers simply cannot be
popularized too widely. And it is due not only to the mathematics
which a more general readership may lack, but also, and in no less
measure, to the extremely counterintuitive nature of much of modern
physics.

And then, Penrose’s latest book is in fact like a Himalaya he built in
the public domain, with a grand and most fascinating view of that
fundamental and all important ﬁeld of science. And that view may,
hopefully, tempt many in the future young generations to try to climb
that wonder, each according to his or her ability. As for the rest who
care to look at it, in this case browse it or read parts of it, it may
serve as one outstanding way to connect somewhat better to things
beyond, and no less important, than day to day concerns or events.
And the fact is that, when it comes to the quality of the book, the
ﬁrst reviewer’s appreciation is far more to the point, and it is only a
pity that he did not elaborate on his respective arguments in more
abundant detail.

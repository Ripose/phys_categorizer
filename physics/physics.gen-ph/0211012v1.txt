Abstract

Attempts for a geometrical interpretation of Quantum The-
ory were made, notably the deBroglie-Bohm formulation. This
was further reﬁned by Santamato who invoked Weyl’s geometry.
However these attempts left a number of unanswered questions.
In the present paper we return to these two formulations, in the
context of recent studies invoking fuzzy spacetime and noncom-
mutative geometry. We argue that it is now possible to explain
the earlier shortcomings. At the same time we get an insight
into the geometric origin of the deBroglie wavelength itself as
also the Wilson-Sommerfeld Quantization rule.

1 Introduction

One of the fruitful approaches to Quantum Mechanics was the so called
deBroglie-Bohm hydrodynamical formulation [1], which originated with
Madelung and was developed by Bohm using deBroglie’s pilot wave
ideas. In this formulation, while the initial position coordinates in a
Quantum Mechanical trajectory, are random, the trajectories them-
selves are determined by classical mechanics. Quantum Mechanics en-
ters through an inexplicable Quantum potential which is again related
to the wave function. This has been a stumbling block in the accep-
tance of the formulation.
Much later, Santamato further developed the deBroglie-Bohm formu-
lation by relating the mysterious Quantum potential to fundamental
geometric properties, by invoking Weyl’s geometry [2, 3, 4]. The net
result was that the mysterious Quantum eﬀects were shown to be re-
lated to the geometric structure of space speciﬁcally to the curvature.
Unfortunately, Weyl’s theory itself did not ﬁnd favour [5]. Apart from

1

anything else, the theory sought to unify electromagnetism with grav-
itation, but on closer scrutiny, in this geometrical structure the two
interactions were actually independent and ad hoc entities as noted by
Einstein himself [6].
We will now reexamine all this in the light of recent developments in
fuzzy spacetime and noncommutative geometry, and argue that infact,
once the underlying fuzzyness is recognized, then the above apparent
diﬃculties disappear.

2 The deBroglie-Bohm Formulation and

Extensions

Let us brieﬂy review the above theory [7]. We start with the Schrodinger

Using the theory of ﬂuid ﬂow, it is well known that (3) and (4) lead
to the Bohm alternative formulation of Quantum Mechanics. In this
theory there is a hidden variable namely the deﬁnite value of position
while the so called Bohm potential Q can be non local, two features
which do not ﬁnd favour with physicists.
Let us now brieﬂy review Weyl’s ideas. He postulated that in addition
to the general coordinate transformations of General Relativity, there
were also gauge transformations which multiplied all components of the

metric tensor gµν, by an arbitrary function of the coordinates. So, the
line elements would no longer be invariant. In its modern version, the
metric tensor is normalized so that its determinant is given by [5],

gµν|

|

=

−

1,

while it now transforms as a tensor density of weight minus half, and
not as a tensor. This leads to the circumstance that there is now a
covariant derivative involving an arbitrary function of coordinates Φµ
given by

Φσ = Γρ

ρσ,

(6)

where the Γ’s denote the Christofell symbols. Weyl identiﬁed Φµ in (6)
with the electromagnetic potential.
It must be noted that in Weyl’s
geometry, even in a Euclidean space there is a covariant derivative and
a non vanishing curvature R.
Santamato exploits this latter fact, within the context of the deBroglie-
Bohm theory and postulates a Lagrangian given by

L(q, ˙q, t) = Lc(q, ˙q, t) + γ(¯h2/m)R(q, t),

He then goes on to obtain the equations of motion like (1),(2), etc. by
invoking an Averaged Least Action Principle

I(t0, t1) = E

L∗(q(t, ω), ˙q(t, ω), t)dt

with respect to the class of all Weyl geometries of space with ﬁxed
metric tensor. This now leads to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation

∂tS + Hc(q,

γ(¯h2/m)R = 0,

and thence to the Schrodinger equation (in curvi-linear coordinates)

As can be seen from the above, the Quantum potential Q is now given
in terms of the scalar curvature R.
We would now like to relate the arbitrary functions Φ of Weyl’s for-
mulation with a noncommutative spacetime geometry, as was shown

recently.
Let us write the product dxµdxν of the line element,

ds2 = gµνddxµdxν,

as a sum of half its anti-symmetric part and half the symmetric part.
The line element now becomes (hµν + ¯hµν)dxµdxν. This leads us back
to the Weyl geometry because the metric tensor ¯hµν now becomes a
tensor density [8, 9].
In other words it is the underlying fuzzyness of space time as expressed
by

[dxµ, dxν]

l2

∼

0(dxµ), that brings out Weyl’s geome-
l being a typical length scale
try, not as an ad hoc feature, but as a truly geometrical consequence,
and therefore also legitimises Santamato’s postulative approach of ex-
tending the deBroglie-Bohm formulation.
At an even more fundamental level, this formalism gives us the rationale
for the deBroglie wave length itself. Because of the noncommutative
geometry in (10) space becomes multiply connected, in the sense that
a closed circuit cannot be shrunk to a point within the interval. Let us
consider the simplest case of double connectivity. In this case, if the
interval is of length λ, we will have, using (5),

d~r = h

dS = mV πλ = πh

(11)

whence

(12)

In (11), the circuit integral was over a circle of diameter λ. Equa-
tion (12) shows the emergence of the deBroglie wavelength. This fol-
lows from the noncommutative geometry of space time, rather than
the physical Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Remembering that Γ
in (11) stands for the angular momentum, this is also the origin of the
Wilson-Sommerfeld quantization rule, an otherwise mysterious Quan-
tum Mechanical prescription.

3 Discussion

1. We would like to stress that Santamato’s treatment via Weyl’s geom-
etry, of the deBroglie-Bohm formulation was postulative (Cf. equations

4

6
(7), (8), (9)), while the Weyl formulation itself had not found favour
for its original motivation. Perhaps this was the reason why Santam-
ato’s formulation was not taken so seriously. On the other hand, we
have argued from the point of view of the noncommutative geometry
(10), which, after many decades, is now coming to be recognized in the
context of Quantum Superstring theory and Quantum Gravity.
2. It is well known that the so called Nelsonian stochastic process re-
sembles the deBroglie-Bohm formulation, with very similar equations
[10, 11]. However in this former case, both the position and velocity
are not deterministic because of an underlying Brownian process. In
this formulation the diﬀusion constant of the theory has to be identiﬁed
with,

ν =

h
m

These are the extra features in this stochastic formulation, rather than
the Quantum potential, which also appears in the equations.
It has
been shown by the author [12, 7], that both the similar approaches in-
fact can be uniﬁed for relativistic velocities, by considering quantized
vortices originating from (11)of the order of the deBroglie, now the
Compton scale l. This immediately brings us back to the fuzzy non-
commutative geometry (10). At the same time it must be pointed out
that the supposedly unsatisfactory non local features of the Quantum
potential Q become meaningful in the above context at the Compton
scale, within which indeed we have exactly such non local eﬀects [13].
It may be pointed out that more recently we have been led back to the
background Quantum vaccuum and the underlying Zero Point Field,
now christened dark energy by the observation of the cosmological con-
stant implied by the accelerated expansion of the universe [7] and it is
this ZPF which provides the Brownian process of the stochastic theory.
As pointed out by Nottale [14], such a Brownian process also eliminates
the hidden variable feature of the deBroglie- Bohm formulation.
Interestingly it has been argued by Enz [15] that a particle extension,
as is implied in the above considerations in the form of a quantized
vortex or fuzzy space time, is the bridge between the particle and wave
aspects.
Infact at this scale, there is zitterbewegung, reminiscent of
deBroglie’s picture of a particle as an oscillator. Originally Dirac had
interpreted the zitterbewegung oscillations as unphysical, which are re-
moved by the fact that due to the Uncertainty Principle we cannot go
down to arbitrarily small space time intervals, so that our space time
points are averages over Compton scale intervals (Cf.[7, 16] for a dis-

5

cussion).
3. It is also interesting to note that Santamato’s tying up of the Quan-
tum potential with the curvature R has been interpreted as being the
result of cosmic ﬂuctuations [17], this being a special case of a more
general but identical earlier result of the author [18, 19].
4. Finally we observe that a complete geometriﬁcation of Quantum
Theory is now possible. Via equation (2) we have introduced in the
wave function the (mass) density ρ and the phase S of the wave function
ψ. As we have seen the phase S is directly related to the determinant
of

infact we have

Further in the above formulation (Cf.ref.[2]) infact we have

Φı = ~

Thus the mass and gravitational and electromagnetic forces (as also the
strong and electroweak interactions Cf.ref.[7]), are related to the basic
metrical properties of spacetime.

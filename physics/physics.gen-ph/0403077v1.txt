Abstract

In conventional quantum mechanics the quantum particle is a special ob-
ject, whose properties are described by special concepts and quantum prin-
ciples. The quantization is a special procedure, which is accompanied by
introduction of special concepts, and this procedure cannot be repeated. In
the model conception of quantum phenomena (MCQP) the quantum parti-
cle is a partial case of a stochastic particle, and the quantum dynamics is a
special case of the stochastic particle dynamics. In MCQP the quantization
is a dynamical procedure, where a special quantum term is added to the La-
grangian of the statistical ensemble of (classical) particles. This procedure
can be repeated many times, because it is not accompanied by introduction
of new concepts. It is very convenient from the formal viewpoint, because the
set of dynamic quantizations forms a one-parameter group, which allows one
to separate the dynamical and statistical (stochastic) properties.

1 Introduction

There are two approaches to the quantization procedure. In the conventional ax-
iomatic conception of quantum phenomena (ACQP), where the wave function ψ
describes the state of a single quantum particle
Sq, the quantization is a procedure,
which is produced on the conceptual level. In the quantization procedure one intro-
duces the Hilbert space of the particle states, wave functions ψ, operators of physical
quantities and quantum principles (the rules for working with all these objects). In
ACQP consideration of a repeated quantization is meaningless, because the quan-
tization is produced on the conceptual level. The repeated quantization needs a
redeﬁnition of the basic concepts. It is impossible, and the repeated quantization
cannot be deﬁned at all.

concepts. As far as the dynamic quantization is simply an addition of some term
to the Lagrangian of the statistical ensemble, nothing prevents from the repeated
addition of the same term to the Lagrangian. Thus, in the framework of MCQP
the repeated dynamic quantization is well deﬁned dynamic procedure. Let the ﬁrst
and the repeated dynamic quantizations have the same intensity, described by the
constant ¯h2. It should expect that the result of the two dynamic quantizations is
equivalent to one dynamic quantization of the double intensity ¯h

′2 = 2¯h2.

In reality, it is so, but mathematical details of the repeated dynamic quantization
are rather curious. They are important for solution of the pair production problem.
We present them in this paper.

may be applied to the statistical ensemble (2.3) of stochastic particles (determin-
istic particles are considered as stochastic ones with vanishing stochasticity). Such
a transformation changes the stochasticity intensity, and we obtain the stochastic
particle dynamics with other kind of stochasticity. Such an approach allows one to
obtain the stochastic particle dynamics with continuous dependence on the stochas-
ticity intensity, described by the parameter a = ¯h2. Such a dependence on the pa-
rameter allows one to separate dynamical properties from the statistical properties,
conditioned by the particle motion stochasticity. Of course, results of description
in the framework of ACQP depend also on the parameter a = ¯h2, but in this case
a change of the parameter a = ¯h2 generates a change of quantum principles, which
contains the parameter a = ¯h2. Besides, setting a = ¯h2 = 0 in the conventional
quantum description, we do not obtain the classical description, because the quan-
tum description do not turn to the classical one at ¯h
In the conventional
quantum description the dynamics is mixed with the stochasticity in such a way,
that separation of them is very diﬃcult problem. Mathematical reason of this tangle
will be shown below.

Thus, the change (2.2) realizes quantization of dynamic equations for a free
relativistic particle by means of dynamic methods, i.e. without a reference to the
quantum principles.

In the action (2.9) b0 is an arbitrary constant, and the actions (2.9) and (2.13)
describe the same dynamic system for any value of b0 6
= 0 (we keep in mind the
case s =const.). But there is a diﬀerence in description of the statistical ensemble
in terms of actions (2.9) and (2.13). The dynamic equation generated by the action
(2.13) is linear, whereas the dynamic equation generated by the action (2.9) is linear
0 = ¯h2. On the other hand, if we set ¯h = 0 in the action (2.9), we obtain
only at b2
the classical description, whereas if we set ¯h = 0 in the action (2.13), we obtain
no description at all. The fact is that the constant b0 is connected with dynamics,

suppress the stochasticity. In the action (2.13) b0 = ¯h, and setting ¯h = 0 in the
action (2.13), we suppress stochasticity and dynamics simultaneously. Thus, in
(2.13) the dynamics is mixed with the stochasticity, and this mixture is a necessary
condition of the dynamic equation linearity. A linearity of dynamic equation is very
attractive. ACQP considers this linearity as a principle. The tungle of stochsticity
and dynamics is a payment for this linearity.

Let us apply the repeated dynamic quantization to the action (2.3). We obtain

3 Discussion

The repeated dynamic quantization manifests the diﬀerence between the approach
of ACQP and that of MCQP. This diﬀerence lies mainly in the interpretation of
the κ-ﬁeld. From the viewpoint of ACQP the κ-ﬁeld does not exist at all, because
according to (2.21) it is a constituent of the wave function, and the wave function
is an attribute of the particle. In the framework of ACQP there is no necessity to
consider the κ-ﬁeld, it is suﬃcient to consider the corresponding wave function. In
ACQP the wave function is a fundamental object of ACQP, whose properties are
described by the quantum axiomatics, and it is useless to divide the wave function
into its constituents.

Est [

Sst], consisting of stochastic particles

In MCQP the wave function is only a method of description of the statistical
Sst. Regular component of the
ensemble
stochastic particle motion is described by the 4-current jk, whereas the stochastic
component is described by the κ-ﬁeld κl. From formal viewpoint the κ-ﬁeld is
a relativistic force ﬁeld, which is generated by the regular component of motion,
and which can exist separately from its source. The κ-ﬁeld interact with regular
component of the particle motion. Two diﬀerent stochastic particle can interact
via their common κ-ﬁeld in a like way, as two charged particles interact via their
Interaction of two particles via the κ-ﬁeld takes
common electromagnetic ﬁeld.
place only in MCQP. This property is absent in ACQP, and it is a serious defect
of ACQP, because the κ-ﬁeld can produce the particle-antiparticle pairs. Neither
electromagnetic ﬁeld, nor gravitational one can produce pairs, because they do not
change the particle mass, that is necessary for the pair production. Only κ-ﬁeld
can produce pairs, because the factor K in (2.3) can make the particle mass m to
be imaginary, when K 2 < 0. It is necessary for the particle 4-velocity component
dx0/dτ can change its sign.

6

The pair production eﬀect is the crucial eﬀect of the high energy particle colli-
sion. Experiments show that the pair production is an essentially quantum eﬀect.
Now there is no satisfactory mechanism of the pair production. Apparently, this
mechanism is connected with application of the κ-ﬁeld. At any rate, the pair pro-
duction by means of the given time-dependent κ-ﬁeld is obtained [6], whereas the
pair production at the collision of two relativistic particles is an unsolved problem.
The conventional description of the pair production in the framework of the quantum
ﬁeld theory is unsatisfactory in some aspects (See for details [6]).

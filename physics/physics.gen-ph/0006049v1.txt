Abstract

It is shown that in the Standard Model, the property of charge quantiza-
tion holds for a Higgs with arbitrary isospin and hypercharge. These deﬁning
quantum numbers of the Higgs remain unconstrained while the whole basic
and fundamental structure of the Standard Model remains intact. Hence it is
shown that the Higgs cannot be a physical particle. Higgs is the underlying
‘vacuum’ over which the whole ediﬁce of the Standard Model stands. Also on
most general grounds it is established here that as per the Standard Model
there is no electric charge above the electro-weak phase transition tempera-
ture. Hence there was no electric charge present in the Early Universe. The
Superstring Theories are ﬂawed in as much as they are incompatible with
this requirement.

1 Charge Quantization in the Standard Model

The SM assumes a repetitive structure for each generation of quarks and
leptons [1]. Let us start by looking at the ﬁrst generation [2] of quarks and
leptons (u, d, e, ν ) and assign them to SU(NC) ⊗ SU(2)L ⊗ U(1)Y (where
NC = 3 ) representation. To keep things as general as possible this brings
in ﬁve unknown hypercharges [3]. Let us now deﬁne the electric charge in
terms of the diagonal generators of SU(2)L ⊗ U(1)Y as

Q = T3 + bY

(1)

In the SM SU(NC) ⊗ SU(2)L ⊗ U(1)Y is spontaneously broken through
the Higgs mechanism to the group SU(3)c ⊗ U(1)em . In SM the Higgs is
assumed to be a doublet [4]. However we do not use this restriction either and
assume the Higgs φ to have any isospin T and arbitrary hypercharge Yφ. The
isospin T φ
3 component of the Higgs develops a nonzero vacuum expectation
value < φ >o. Since we want the U(1)em generator Q to be unbroken we
require Q < φ >o= 0. This right away ﬁxes b in (3) and we get

Q = T3 − (

)Y

(2)

For the SM to be renormalizable we require that the triangular anomaly
be canceled. This leads to certain constraints which place some restrictions
on the hypercharges. Also the use of the fact that after the spontaneous
breaking of SU(NC) ⊗ SU(2)L ⊗ U(1)Y to SU(NC) ⊗ U(1)em, the L- and
R-handed charges couple identically with photon helps in pinning down hy-
percharges in terms of the hypercharge of the Higgs. Hence one obtains
quantized electric charges as

For NC = 3 these are the correct charges in the SM. Note that this
charge quantization in the SM holds for Higgs for arbitrary T and arbitrary
hypercharge. Hence as far as charge quantization is concerned, the values of
T and Yφ remain unconstrained. This point, for the special case of the Higgs
doublet was already noted by the author earlier [4].

2 Higgs particle - a ghost !

Let us continue with the rest of the structure of the SM and see how our
general Higgs with unconstrained and unspeciﬁed isospin T and hypercharge
Yφ ﬁts into it. We can write the covariant derivative of the SM as

Dµ = ∂µ + ig1

The photon ﬁeld Aµ and the orthogonal Zµ are written as

We ﬁnd that with the hypercharges as speciﬁed above the complete struc-
ture of the Standard Model stands intact [5]. The point to be emphasized
is that all this is independent of Higgs isospin and hypercharge, which all
throughout remain unconstrained and undetermined. One should not ﬁx
any arbitrary values for them as nothing in the theory demands it.

3

We ﬁnd that from rho parameter also [5] the solutions for the isospin of
the Higgs are inﬁnite in number. Again, nothing in the theory demands that
one ﬁxes the isospin to a particular value.

The point is that the full structure of the SM stands intact without con-
straining the quantum numbers isospin and/or the hypercharge of the Higgs
to any speciﬁc value. All the particles that have been isolated in the labo-
ratory or have been studied by any other means, besides having a speciﬁc
mass, have deﬁnite quantum numbers which identify them. In the case of
Higgs here, no one knows of its mass and more importantly its quantum
numbers like isospin and hypercharge, as shown above, are not speciﬁed.
The hypercharge of all the other particles are speciﬁed as being proportional
to the Higgs hypercharge which itself remains unconstrained. That is, all the
hypercharges of particles are rooted on to the Higgs hypercharge which itself
remains free and unspeciﬁed. Hence Higgs is very diﬀerent from all known
particles. Because of the above reasons Higgs cannot be a physical particle
which may be isolated and studied. It must be just the ‘vacuum’ which sets
up the structure of the whole thing. So Higgs is a ghost which shall not
manifest itself as a genuine particle in the laboratory [5].

3 Superstring Theories-intrinsically ﬂawed!

Now we ask the question, with this generalized picture what happens to the
electric charge when the full Standard Model symmetry is restored.

Note that the expression for Q in (2) arose due to spontaneous symmetry
breaking of SU(NC) ⊗ SU(2)L × U(1)Y (for NC = 3 ) to SU(NC) × U(1)em
through the medium of a Higgs with arbitrary isospin T and hypercharge Yφ.
What happens when at higher temperature, as for example found in the early
universe, the SU(NC)⊗SU(2)L ⊗U(1)Y symmetry is restored ? Then the pa-
rameter ‘b’ in the electric charge deﬁnition remains undetermined. Note that
‘b’ was ﬁxed above due to spontaneous symmetry breaking through Higgs.
Without it ‘b’ remains unknown. Hence when the electroweak symmetry is
restored, irrespective of the Higgs isospin and hypercharge the electric charge
disappears as a physical quantity. Therefore we ﬁnd that there was no electric
charge in the early universe.

Here attention is drawn to the fact that all putative extensions of the
Standard Model should reduce smoothly and consistently to the Standard

4

Model at low energies. Not only that, all these extensions should be consis-
tent with the predictions of the Standard Model at very high temperatures.
Contrary to naive expectations, the SM does make speciﬁc predictions at very
high temperatures too. For example one clear-cut prediction of the Standard
Model as shown here and also shown earlier, is that at high enough temper-
atures (as in the early universe) when the unbroken SU(3) ⊗ SU(2) ⊗ U(1)
symmetry was restored, there was no electric charge. GUTs and other stan-
dard extensions of the SM are incompatible with this requirement [6].

What about Superstring Theories ? Quite clearly, generically in Super-
string Theories electric charge exists right up to the Planck Scale [7]. Hence
as per this theory the electric charge, as an inherent property of matter, has
existed right from the beginning [8]. This is not correct in the SM. As shown
here and earlier, the electric charge came into existence at a later stage in
the evolution of the Universe when the SU(2)L ⊗ U(1)Y group was sponta-
neously broken to U(1)em. It was never there all the time. This is because
electric charge is a derived quantity. Hence we ﬁnd that in this regard the
Superstring Theories are inconsistent with the SM and hence ﬂawed [9].

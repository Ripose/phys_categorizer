Abstract The concept of deﬁnability of physical ﬁelds in a set-theoretical
foundation is introduced. We propose an axiomatic set theory and show that
the Schr¨odinger equation and, more generally, a nonlinear sigma model can
be derived from a null postulate and that quantization of ﬁelds is equivalent
to deﬁnability. We ﬁnd that space-time is relational in this theory. Some
examples of the relevance to physics are suggested.

A set U of ﬁnite integers is deﬁnable in the set theory if and only if there
exists a formula ΦU (n) from which we can unequivocally determine whether
a given ﬁnite integer n is a member of U or not.[1] We can extend this
concept to physical ﬁelds by asserting that a physical ﬁeld in a ﬁnite region
of space is deﬁnable in a set-theoretical foundation if and only if the set
of distributions of the ﬁelds energy among eigenstates can be mirrored in
that theory by a deﬁnable set of ﬁnite integers. This concept of deﬁnability
is appropriate because, were there a ﬁeld whose set of energy distributions
among eigenstates corresponded to an undeﬁnable set of ﬁnite integers, that
ﬁeld would have at least one energy distribution whose presence or absence
is impossible to determine, so the ﬁeld could not be veriﬁable or falsiﬁable.
Therefore, our task is to ﬁnd a foundation in which it is possible to specify the
deﬁnable sets of ﬁnite integers and which must also contain the mathematics
necessary for the physical ﬁelds corresponding to the sets.

Extensionality Two sets with just the same members are equal.
Pairs
Union

For every two sets, there is a set that contains just them.
For every set of sets, there is a set with just all their
members.
There is at least one set ω∗ with members determined in
inﬁnite succession.
For every set, there is a set containing just all its subsets.
Every non-empty set has a minimal member
(i.e. “weak” regularity).
Replacing members of a set one-for-one creates a set.

These axioms are the well-known theory of Zermelo-Frankel (ZF) with the
axiom schema of subsets deleted. As a result of that deletion, all theorems
must hold for every ω∗. The minimal ω∗, usually called ω, cannot be obtained,
so that both ﬁnite and inﬁnite integers exist in ω∗. This implies that all sets
of ﬁnite integers are ﬁnite and hence deﬁnable.

We can now adjoin to this theory another axiom asserting that all subsets of
ω∗ are constructible. By constructible sets we mean sets that are generated
sequentially by some process, one after the other, so that the process well-
orders the sets. G¨odel has shown that an axiom asserting that all sets are
constructible can be consistently added to ZF, giving a theory called ZFC+.[2]
It has also been shown that no more that countably many subsets of ω∗ can
be proven to exist in ZFC+. Both these results will, of course, hold for the
sub-theory ZFC+ minus the axiom schema of subsets. Therefore we can
adjoin a new axiom asserting that the subsets of ω∗ are constructible and
there are countably many such subsets. We shall call these eight axioms
Theory T.

We ﬁrst show that T contains a real line. Recall the deﬁnition of “rational
numbers” as the set of ratios, usually called Q, of any two members of the
In T, we can likewise, using the axiom of unions, establish for ω∗
set ω.
the set of ratios of any two of its integers, ﬁnite or inﬁnite. This will be an
“enlargement” of the rational numbers and we shall call this enlargement Q∗.
Two members of Q∗ are called “identical” if their ratio is 1. We now employ
” for “is identical to”. An “inﬁnitesimal” is a member of Q∗
the symbol “
“equal” to 0, i.e., letting y signify the member and employing the symbol
“=” to signify equality, y = 0
k[y < l/k], where k is a ﬁnite integer.
The reciprocal of an inﬁnitesimal is “inﬁnite”. A member of Q∗ that is not

an inﬁnitesimal and not inﬁnite is “ﬁnite”. The constructibility axiom well-
orders the power set of ω∗, creating a metric space composed of the subsets
of ω∗. These subsets represent the binimals making up a real line R∗.

If some derivative is a constant, they are polynomials.

We can now deﬁne “functions of a real variable in T”. u(x) is a function of
a real variable in T only if it is a constant or a sequence in x of continuously
connected biunique pieces such that the derivative of u with respect to x is
also a function of a real variable in T. These functions are thus of bounded
variation.
If no
derivative is a constant, these functions do not exist in T. They can, however,
be approached arbitrarily closely by some linear combination of polynomials
of very high degree given by many iterations of the following variational form
for the Sturm-Liouville problem, so that these polynomials are eﬀectively

A generalization to ﬁnitely many space-like and time-like dimensions can
now be obtained. Let uℓmi(xi) and uℓmj(xj) be eigenfunctions with non-
negative eigenvalues λℓmi and λℓmj respectively. We assert a “ﬁeld” is a sum of

In this integral expression the P and Q can be functions of any of the xi and

Quantization is thus obtained within this theory utilizing both the relational
nature of space-time in T and a physical null postulate. The Schr¨odinger
equation can now be derived for ﬁnitely many space variables and one time
variable. Thence we can get the eigenstates and the energy levels asso-
ciated with each state. When there are ﬁnitely many space-like dimen-
sions and one time-like dimension, we can obtain the Schr¨odinger equation
from the nonlinear sigma model: Let ℓ = 1,2 and suppress m. We can

the Lagrange density, exists only in quanta of hωm/2π. The sum of energies
in all of the eigenstates Et is thus Σnmhωm/2π where nm is the number of
quanta in the mth eigenstate. For any ﬁnite energy, every ordered set of ﬁnite
integers nm corresponding to the number of quanta residing in each of the
eigenstates, using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, maps bi-uniquely
m , where Pm is the mth prime starting with 2. The set of these
P nm
with
ﬁnite integers must always be deﬁnable in T. Furthermore, conversely, for
classical physics a deﬁnable ﬁeld does not exist in T. Given ﬁnite Et and
ωm, then, if h were inﬁnitesimal, some nm would have to be inﬁnite and thus
the set of all distributions of energy among the eigenstates could not be mir-
rored by any set (in T) of ﬁnite integers. Accordingly, deﬁnability in T is
equivalent to quantization.

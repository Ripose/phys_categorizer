General Relativity Requires
Absolute Space and Time

Rainer W. K¨uhne
Lechstr. 63, 38120 Braunschweig, Germany

We examine two far-reaching and somewhat
heretic consequences of General Relativity.
(i) It requires a cosmology which includes
a preferred rest frame, absolute space and
time. (ii) A rotating universe and time travel
are strict solutions of General Relativity.

1 Space and Time Before

General Relativity

According to Aristotle, the Earth was resting in the
centre of the universe. He considered the terrestrial
frame as a preferred frame and all motion relative
to the Earth as absolute motion. Space and time
were absolute [1].

In the days of Galileo the heliocentric model of
Copernicus [2] was valid. The Sun was thought
to be resting within the centre of the universe and
deﬁning a preferred frame. Galileo argued that only
relative motion was observed but not absolute mo-
tion. However, to ﬁx motion he considered it as
necessary to have not only relative motion, but also
absolute motion [3].

Newton introduced the mathematical description
of Galileo’s kinematics. His equations described
only relative motion. Absolute motion did not ap-
pear in his equations [4].

This inspired Leibniz to suggest that absolute
motion is not required by the classical mechanics
introduced by Galileo and Newton [5].

Huyghens introduced the wave theory of light.
According to his theory, light waves propagate via
oscillations of a new medium which consists of very
tiny particles, which he named aether particles. He
considered the rest frame of the luminiferous aether
as a preferred frame [6].

The aether concept reappeared in Maxwell’s the-
ory of classical electrodynamics [7]. Faraday [8]
uniﬁed Coulomb’s theory of electricity [9] with

1

Amp`ere’s theory of magnetism [10]. Maxwell uni-
ﬁed Faraday’s theory with Huyghens’ wave the-
ory of light, where in Maxwell’s theory light is
considered as an oscillating electromagnetic wave
which propagates through the luminiferous aether
of Huyghens.

We all know that the classical kinematics was re-
placed by Einstein’s Special Relativity [11]. Less
known is that Special Relativity is not able to an-
swer several problems that were explained by clas-
sical mechanics.

According to the relativity principle of Special
Relativity, all inertial frames are equivalent, there
is no preferred frame. Absolute motion is not re-
quired, only the relative motion between the iner-
tial frames is needed. The postulated absence of an
absolute frame prohibits the existence of an aether
[11].

According to Special Relativity, each inertial
frame has its own relative time. One can infer via
the Lorentz transformations [12] on the time of the
other inertial frames. Absolute space and time do
not exist. Furthermore, space is homogeneous and
isotropic, there does not exist any rotational axis of
the universe.

It is often believed that the Michelson-Morley ex-
periment [13] conﬁrmed the relativity principle and
refuted the existence of a preferred frame. This
believe is not correct.
In fact, the result of the
Michelson-Morley experiment disproved the exis-
tence of a preferred frame only if Galilei invariance
is assumed. The experiment can be completely ex-
plained by using Lorentz invariance alone, the rela-
tivity principle is not required.

By the way, the relativity principle is not a phe-
nomenon that belongs solely to Special Relativity.
According to Leibniz it can be applied also to clas-
sical mechanics.

Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity has three

problems.

(i) The space of Special Relativity is empty.
There are no entities apart from the observers and
the observed objects in the inertial frames. By con-
trast, the space of classical mechanics can be ﬁlled
with, say, radiation or turbulent ﬂuids.

(ii) Without the concept of an aether Special
Relativity can only describe but not explain why
electric and magnetic ﬁelds oscillate in propagating
light waves.

(iii) Special Relativity does not satisfy the equiva-

lence principle [14] of General Relativity, according
to which inertial mass and gravitational mass are
identical. Special Relativity considers only inertial
mass.

Special Relativity is a valid approximation of re-
ality which is appropriate for the description of
most of the physical phenomena examined until the
beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century. However, the
macroscopic properties of space and time are better
described by General Relativity.

2 General Relativity: Abso-

lute Space and Time

In 1915 Einstein presented the ﬁeld equations of
General Relativity [15] and in 1916 he presented the
ﬁrst comprehensive article on his theory [16]. In a
later work he showed an analogy between Maxwell’s
theory and General Relativity. The solutions of the
free Maxwell equations are electromagnetic waves
while the solutions of the free Einstein ﬁeld equa-
tions are gravitational waves which propagate on
an oscillating metric [17]. As a consequence, Ein-
stein called space the aether of General Relativity
[18]. However, even within the framework of Gen-
eral Relativity do electromagnetic waves not prop-
agate through a luminiferous aether.

Einstein applied the ﬁeld equations of General
Relativity on the entire universe [19]. He presented
a solution of a homogeneous, isotropic, and static
universe, where the space has a positive curvature.
This model became known as the Einstein universe.
However, de Sitter has shown that the Einstein uni-
verse is not stable against density ﬂuctuations [20].
This problem was solved by Friedmann and
Lemaˆitre who suggested a homogeneous and
isotropic expanding universe where the space is
curved [21].

Robertson and Walker presented a metric for a
homogeneous and isotropic universe [22]. Accord-
ing to G¨odel this metric requires an absolute time
[23]. In any homogeneous and isotropic cosmology
the Hubble constant [24] and its inverse, the Hub-
ble age of the universe, are absolute and not rela-
tive quantities. In the Friedmann-Lemaˆitre universe
there exists a relation between the actual age of the
universe and the Hubble age.

According to Bondi and Gold, a preferred mo-
tion is given at each point of space by cosmological

observations, namely the redshift-distance relation
generated by the Hubble eﬀect. It appears isotropic
only for a unique rest frame [25].

I argued that the Friedmann-Lemaˆitre universe
has a ﬁnite age and therefore a ﬁnite light cone.
The centre-of-mass frame of this Hubble sphere can
be regarded as a preferred frame [26].

After the discovery of the cosmic microwave back-
ground radiation by Penzias and Wilson [27], it was
predicted that it should have a dipole anisotropy
generated by the Doppler eﬀect by the Earth’s mo-
tion. This dipole anisotropy was predicted in ac-
cordance with Lorentz invariance [28] and later dis-
covered experimentally [29]. Peebles called these
experiments “aether drift experiments” [30].

The preferred frames deﬁned by the Robertson-
Walker metric, the Hubble eﬀect, and the cosmic
microwave background radiation are probably iden-
tical. In this case the absolute motion of the Sun
was determined by the dipole anisotropy experi-
ments of the cosmic microwave background radi-
ation to be (371 ± 1) km/s.

I suggested that this aether drift can give rise to
local physical eﬀects.
I introduced the theory of
quantum electromagnetodynamics [26]. It is a gen-
eralization of quantum electrodynamics [31] which
includes Dirac’s magnetic monopoles [32] and two
kinds of photons, Einstein’s electric photon [33] and
Salam’s magnetic photon [34]. I predicted that ev-
ery light source which emits electric photons does
emit also magnetic photons. The ratio between
the interaction cross-sections of the magnetic pho-
ton and the electric photon shall depend on the
aether drift of the laboratory. The results of re-
cent experiments to test my theory may be inter-
preted as preliminary evidence for these magnetic
photon rays. These experiments were performed
in Vienna/Austria by Alipasha Vaziri in February
2002 and in Madison/Wisconsin by Roderic Lakes
in March and June 2002.

3 General Relativity: Ro-
tating Universe and Time
Travel

It is well-known that planets, stars, and galaxies
rotate. So Lanczos and Gamow speculated that the
entire universe may rotate and that the rotating

2

universe might have generated the rotation of the
galaxies [35].

proved that an observer outside the gravitational
ﬁeld would also see time-travel.

G¨odel was the ﬁrst to show that a rotating uni-
verse is a strict solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equa-
tions for a homogeneous and anisotropic universe.
He considered a non-expanding universe and has
shown that it allows closed time-like curves, i.e.
time-travel. He predicted that the original order
of the rotation axes of galaxies was parallel to the
universal rotation axis [23].

Raychaudhuri presented a model for an expand-
ing and rotating universe which is a generaliza-
tion of both the Friedmann-Lemaˆitre universe and
the G¨odel universe. This cosmology, too, includes
closed time-like curves [36].

Possibly, the Raychaudhuri universe did not start
from a singularity (big bang), but from a closed
time-like curve, i.e. from a time-machine.

Gregory, Thompson, and Tiﬀt discovered that
the distribution of the rotation axes for both the
spiral and ellipsoid galaxies of the ﬁlament-like
Perseus-Pisces supercluster is bimodal. One of the
peaks is roughly aligned with the major axis of
the supercluster while the second peak is roughly
90◦ from the ﬁrst [37]. This anisotropic distribu-
tion cannot be explained by conventional models of
galaxy-formation. Therefore I suggested that this
might be a remnant of the original aligned distribu-
tion of galactic rotation axes generated by a rotat-
ing universe [38].

A rotating universe with both vorticity and shear
would generate an anisotropy of the cosmic mi-
crowave background radiation. Collins and Hawk-
ing were able to set tight bounds on this eﬀect [39].
However, Korotky and Obukhov showed that the
generation of this anisotropy is an eﬀect of shear
and not of vorticity alone. So the observed isotropy
of the cosmic microwave background radiation does
not contradict the idea of a rotating universe, where
the rotation period could be as high as the Hubble
age of the universe [40].

There is some discussion whether General Rela-
tivity could allow local time-machines. Carter has
shown that the Kerr metric [41] of rotating spheri-
cal bodies can generate closed time-like curves [42].
This inspired Tipler to investigate a rapidly rotat-
ing cylinder with 100 km length, 15 km radius,
1014g/cm3 density, and a rotational speed of 70% of
the speed of light. This object yielded closed time-
like curves [43]. However, until now it has not been

To conclude, General Relativity requires a cos-
mology which includes a preferred frame, absolute
space and time and which may include a rotating
universe and time-travel. Such a universe may have
originated not from a singularity (big bang), but
from a closed time-like curve (time-machine).

Abstract

We extend the special relativity into the superluminal case and ﬁrstly put

forward a new superluminal theory of kinematics, in which we show that

the temporal coordinate need exchanging with one of the spatial coordinates

in a superluminal inertial frame, and that the coordinate transformations

from any superluminal inertial frame to the rest frame (here rest just says

in a relative sense) are the same as the Lorentz transformations from some

normal inertial frame to the rest frame; consequently, the causality can not be

violated. Secondly, we discuss the superluminal theory of dynamics and then

lead to a conclusion that the total energy of any object moving at a speed of

v (faster than the speed of light

in vacuum c) is equal to the total energy

of that object moving at a speed of u (u < c), and the product of two speeds

satisﬁes uv = c2. Lastly, we conjecture that this superluminal theory can give

another novel interpretation to the essence of matter waves put forward by

de Broglie.

Since the special relativity (SR) was put forward by Einstein [1] in 1905, the speed of light

in vacuum c has always been regarded as the limit of particle velocity. As is so often pointed

out, the causality will be violated if there are tachyons in our world [2] . In fact, nature has

exhibited many superluminal phenomena to us, especially in astronomy [3,4] , but they do

not imply the genuine existence of superluminal objects. Furthermore, there exist various

proposals for observing faster-than-c propagation of light using anomalous dispersion near

an absorption line and linear gain lines, or tunnelling barriers [5–8] . It is notable that, using

gain-assisted linear anomalous dispersion, the group velocity of a laser pulse propagation in

atomic caesium gas can exceed c and even become negative, while the shape of the pulse

is preserved [9] . But these proposals can not be explicitly interpreted as the motion of

tachyons. The same case also occurs in the propagation of localized microwaves [10] . All

these seem to suggest that the speed of any moving object cannot exceed c indeed. But

virtually, Einstein just tells us that c is the limit of particle velocity in vacuum. As we

know, the limit may indicate the upper bound of the particle velocity which corresponds to

the SR, while it may mean the lower bound. In our paper, we aim to develop a superluminal

theory which is not at odds with causality but covers most excellent achievements of SR.

Let S denote the rest frame in which x, y and z are three spatial coordinates and t is

the temporal coordinate. S′ is an inertial frame moving at the speed of v along x-axis of S.

Denote x′, y′, z′ and t′ as three spatial coordinates and temporal coordinate respectively in

S′. At the initial time t = t′ = 0, the origins of two frames are superposed each other. In

terms of SR, the Lorentz transformations between S and S′ can be expressed as follow:

x′ =

where c is the light speed in vacuum and v < c. Eq. (1-iii) and Eq. (1-iv) tell us that we

merely need to consider the relation between the pairs (x, ct) and (x′, ct′). Their geometrical

relation is shown in Fig.1. The positions of x′-axis and ct′-axis in the coordinate frame (x, ct)

are obtained:

Eq. (2) is valid if v < c, from which we can deduce that, in Fig.1, both x′-axis and ct′-axis

are rotating to the line (x = ct) with the increasing of v, and we can suppose that they

superpose with the line (x = ct) if v = c. Moreover, we can imagine that, if v > c, x′-axis

enters the domains between that line and ct-axis, and ct′-axis enters the other domains. In

this case, we need to redeﬁne the concepts of x′ and ct′ in S′.

We extrapolate Lorentz transformations to the superluminal case (v > c):

Consider an invariant of Minkowski space-time:

∆s2 = x2 + (ict)2 = x′2 + (ict′)2,

where the terms y2, z2, y′2, z′2 are omitted for the sake of Eq. (1-iii) and Eq. (1-iv). Eq. (4)

tells us that the subtle distinction between space and time of S is that, in the expression

of the invariant ∆s2, the spatial coordinate x is a real number and the temporal term ict

is a purely imaginary number. This attribute can be extracted as a criterion to distinguish

between the concepts of space and time.

Now substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (4), we obtain the expression of ∆s2 in S′:

Comparing Eq. (7) with Eq. (2), we observe that, in the superluminal inertial frame,

the temporal coordinate exchanges with the spatial coordinate in the motion direction.

This conclusion can be understood by the following way: for every point P in the space-

time, we can express it with (x, y, z, ct) in the rest frame S and with four real numbers

1, q′
q′

2, q′

3, q′
4}

in some inertial frame S′. We just know something about

{
that three of them are spatial coordinates and the rest one is temporal coordinate. If S′ and

1, q′
q′
{

2, q′

3, q′

is

S are selected according to the rules indicated at the beginning of this article, we can take

3 and q′
q′

4 as spatial coordinates and set q′

3 = y, q′

4 = z. Furthermore, we know that

form an invariant

(αq′

1)2 + (βq′

2)2 = x2 + (ict)2,

where α and β are imaginary numbers, one being a real number and another a purely imagi-

nary number. If α is a purely imaginary number, then q′
2 the spatial coordinate in S′. Contrariwise, q′

and q′

1 represents the temporal coordinate
1 represents the spatial coordinate and q′

2

the temporal coordinate. Need to say, q′

2, q′
4 are real numbers because we regard
them as measurable magnitudes. In a word, the Lorentz transformations between S and S′

3 and q′

1, q′

are Eq. (6) if S′ is a superluminal inertial frame; otherwise take Eq. (1).

Now suppose there is another inertial frame S′′ moving at the speed of u (u = c2

v < c)

along x-axis of S. The Lorentz transformations between S and S′′ is:

Obviously, Eq. (10) coincides with Eq. (6), which means that the coordinate transformations

between S and S′ (v > c) are the same as the Lorentz transformations between S and

S′′ (u < c). As is known, the causality is abided by in the inertial frame S′′ since u < c.

Therefore, it can not be violated in the inertial frame S′ when v > c as long as we redeﬁne

the concepts of space and time in S′ according to Eq. (6).

Now let us turn to the superluminal dynamics.

Based on SR, we can construct another invariant Ψ:

Ψ = xpx + (ict)(iE/c),

(11)

where px is the x-direction momentum of an object observed in some inertial frame and E

is the total energy. Here we still omit the magnitudes involving y and z. It is evidence that

the position of x is equivalent to that of px in the expression Ψ. The case is available to

ct and E/c. Therefore, we need to redeﬁne the concepts of momentums and energy in S′ if

v > c. Imitating Eq. (6), we deﬁne

E′/c =

Assume there is an object moving at the speed of v (v > c) along x-axis of S. Fixing S′

on this object, we know that

p′
x = 0, and denote E0 =
f

E′ called the rest energy. Eq. (12)
f

suggests

(10)

(12)

(13)

where the symbol E in Eq. (12) has been replaced by Ev.

In fact, from SR we have known that the total energy and the rest energy has the

following relation

Ev = E0/q1

(c/v)2,

−

Eu = E0/q1

(u/c)2

−

(14)

when an object moves at the speed of u (u < c) along x-axis of S. In the same way, here
we use Eu to replace the symbol E. Obviously, if u = c2

v , then Ev = Eu, which means

the total energy of an object moving at a speed of v (v > c) is equal to the total energy

of that object moving at a speed of u (u < c), and the product of two speeds is uv = c2.

Considering SR and Eq. (13), we can plot the curve shown in Fig.2 to describe the total

energy E of an object varying with the velocity v (here 0 < v < +

and v

= c) if the rest

∞

energy E0 > 0. As is shown in Fig.2, the total energy E increases with the increasing of v

if v < c; and decreases with the increasing of v if v > c. If v

c, then E

+

. As to

−→

−→

∞

the mechanism that the object switches from the lower-than-c state to faster-than-c state,

it is a mystery.

The expression uv = c2 is not unfamiliar to us. Actually, we have reached it in the

de Broglie hypothesis of matter waves long before. This hypothesis implies that the group

velocity ug and the phase velocity vp of matter waves satisfy the same expression ugvp = c2

[11] . If this is not just a coincidence, the further development our theory will give another

novel interpretation to the essence of matter waves.

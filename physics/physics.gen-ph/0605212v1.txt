Lorentz Transformation from Symmetry of Reference Principle

The Lorentz Transformation is traditionally derived requiring the Principle of Relativity and light-
speed universality. While the latter can be relaxed, the Principle of Relativity is seen as core to the
transformation. The present letter relaxes both statements to the weaker, Symmetry of Reference
Principle. Thus the resulting Lorentz transformation and its consequences (time dilatation, length
contraction) are, in turn, eﬀects of how we manage space and time.

Starting with the 1905 paper of A. Einstein in Ann.
Phys. [1] the Lorentz Transformation has been tradition-
ally derived based on the Principle of Relativity and light-
speed universality. A number of studies [2] have shown
that light-speed universality is not needed - the ﬁrst such
publication (1906) being owed to H. Poincar´e [3]. Group
theory expresses the transitivity property of relativity (C
relative to A, if A to B and B to C) in the form of the
group closure relation, respectively the product of two
group elements being another element of the group. Pure
relativity transformations however, cannot form a group
on their own, needing rotations to “close” the group. As
such, the full group is not immediate from the Principle of
Relativity and needs to be speciﬁed (in this case a group
of transformations invarying the metric: Λ†GΛ = G,
where Λ are the transformations and G the metric). En-
tering the Lorentz group however, is equivalent to admit-
ting light speed invariance. In this sense the Principle of
Relativity and (indirectly) light speed invariance are core
to the Lorentz Transformation [4].

The present letter shows however, that neither state-
ment is necessary and that the Lorentz transformation
stems from the simpler (weaker) Principle of Symme-
try of reference systems. Further more, the Minkowsky
metric is not unique in deﬁning relativity. There are
two possible classes of transformations, one invarying the
Minkowsky and the other the Euclidian metric. The ad-
hoc terminology of Minkowsky and Euclidian relativities
will be thus adopted throughout this letter.

Consider two coordinate systems in motion that at
some point were at rest relative to each other and were
aligned to have the same orientation, oﬀset and (Euclid-
ian) space-metric. The transformation between such co-
ordinate systems is:

where the dimensions of the objects involved is given by
the subscripts. In general the transformation should be
an integral, non-linear transformation, however general
considerations about space-time limit the range of possi-
ble transformations to constant linear transformations:

}

2. homogeneity - implies that the transformation must
not depend on the relocation of the coordinate sys-
tem, hence linear;

3. isotropy - implies that the mathematical objects
in the transformation cannot be “pseudo”-objects,
since coordinate system space/time inversion must
not aﬀect the transformation. Also, the vectors
must be parallel to ~v - the relative velocity between
the systems in causa, as no new direction in space
can be introduced (isotropy). Likewise, the general
form of the tensor - less a (×~v) pseudo-tensorial
part ruled out by isotropy, is λCk + µC⊥, where
Ck selects vector components parallel to ~v, and C⊥
components perpendicular to ~v. The scalars must
be functions of |~v|, as there exists no preferred di-
rection in space.

The transformation can be thus written as:

Λ = γv

1
−ψv~v

(cid:18)

−~v/c2
vs
λvCk + µvC⊥ (cid:19)

(2)

with the scalars fulﬁlling the roles described above and
s a sign factor s = ±1. For reasons evident later the
two shall be termed Minkowsky (s = +1) and Euclidian
relativity (s = −1).

The apparent-velocity of an object moving with ~u in

the base-system is seen in the moving-system as:

~u ⊖ ~v =

−ψv~v + λv~uk + µv~u⊥
1 − ~v~u/c2
vs

the scalar cv having units of speed.

The following are evident:

1. for ~v → 0 the transformation is unitary:

Λ~v = 1

lim
v→0

(3)

(4)

hence γv, λv, µv = 1,

2. ~v ⊖ ~0 = - ~0 ⊖ ~v

thus ψv = 1.

3. ~v ⊖ ~v = ~0

4. Λ−~v = Λ−1
~v

thus:

thus

λv = ψv = 1.

1. locality - implies that the transformation must be

• γv = ±1/

1 − ~v2/c2s, the valid sign (+) be-

point-to-point;

ing determined from limv→0,

v2/c2 − 1 for v > c, however tachyon

the acceleration parallel to the force diverging with in-
creasing speed. In Minkowsky relativity however, as par-
ticles approach the light-cone (from above, or below) ac-
celeration in the direction of the force is annulled.

• µv = ±1/γv, the valid sign (+) being deter-

mined from limv→0.

5. |~v2 ⊖ ~v1| = |~v1 ⊖ ~v2|

implies c1 = c2 = c a constant

and s1 = s2 = the same sign.

From the apparent-velocity law, the combined speed is:

|~u ⊖ ~v|2 =

(~u − ~v)2 − s(~u × ~v)2
(1 − ~u~v/c2s)2

conﬁrming vlim ≤ c for s = +1 at point (4) above. The
two cases are somewhat similar for v or u > c, but diﬀer
signiﬁcantly for v and u < c.

The transformation is thus now:

Λ =

γv
−γv~v

(cid:18)

−γv~v/c2s
γvCk + C⊥ (cid:19)

respectively the well known Lorentz transformation for
s = +1. The meaning of c is related to causality: for both
Minkowsky and Euclidian relativities the transformed
time interval versus proper time is dt′ = γv(1−~v~u/c2s)dτ ,
respectively a causal transformation for v < c. For
c → ∞ the Galilean transformation is recovered.

The Principle of Relativity (group “closure” - modulo

a rotation) has not been used thus far:

(7)

Λ1Λ−1

2 = RΛ12
where Λ1,2 are two coordinate transformations, Λ12 the
system-1 to system-2 transformation and R an align-
ment rotation (~v2 ⊖ ~v1) = −R(~v1 ⊖ ~v2) that appears due
to boost when referencing is done via alignment with a
(third party) base-system. In a strong sense the Princi-
ple of Relativity is the group “closure” [3] relation (7) -
satisﬁed by both Euclidian and Minkowsky relativities,
however in a weaker form it has been used in relations
(2), (3) and (5) as the Symmetry of Reference Principle.
The only isotropic metrics invariant under the transfor-
mations are the Euclidian (s = −1) and the Minkowsky
(s = +1) metric.

Principially tachyons are allowed in both Minkowsky
and Euclidian relativities, with the notable diﬀerence
that continuous acceleration across the light-cone is pos-
sible only in the latter. For tachyons time can be seen
as running backward if ~u~vs > c2. Since the beginning
and end points of a tachyon track are not labeled, the
tachyon could look like a sub-luminous particle. In cer-
tain contexts the apparent speed of a tachyon can even
be vtachyon ≪ c. Another interesting aspect of tachyons
is their apparent charge ρ′ = γvρ(1 − ~v~u/c2s), of oppo-
site sign to ρ when the apparent time of the tachyon is
running backward. Apparent time-reversal couples well
with charge-conjugation, which is supposed to turn all
currents into anti-currents, rather than each one indi-
vidually - with the γDirac matrices of its own quantum
space. With respect to other charge-conjugation repre-
sentations, time-reversal (γ0γ5 in the Dirac theory) is

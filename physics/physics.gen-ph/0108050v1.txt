A comment on the paper ”Deformed Boost
Transformations that saturate at the Planck Scale”
by N.B.Bruno,G.Amelino-Camelia, and
J.Kowalski-Glikman

Alex Granik∗

Abstract

An alternative ( simpliﬁed) derivation of the dispersion relation and
the expressions for the momentum-energy 4-vector pi, p0 given initially
in [1] is provided.
It has turned out that in a rather ”pedestrian”
manner one can obtain in one stroke not only the above relations but
also the correct dispersion relation in ω
ki space, consistent with
the value of a velocity of a massless particle. This is achieved by
considering the standard Lorentz algebra for ω
ki-space. A non-
uniqueness of the choice of the time-derivative in the presence of the
ﬁnite length scale is discussed. It is shown that such non-uniqueness
ki-space. albeit results in
does not aﬀect the dispersion relation in ω
diﬀerent dispersion relations in p
p0-space depending on the choice
of the deﬁnition of the time derivative.

Introduction

In this paper we revisit the work by N.B.Bruno,G.Amelino-Camelia, and
J.Kowalski-Glikman [1] on ﬁnite boost transformations (BAK transforma-
tions) following from the κ-Poincare algebra. The prime motivation of our
return to these results was that in the space of the boost parameter ξ the
commutation relations of the phase portion of the algebra are pronouncedly
non-symmetric.
As a result this leads to somewhat involved exact explicit expressions for
the spatio-temporal components of the four-momentum as functions of the

boost parameter ξ. We re
derive all their results by introducing Lorentz
algebra (a subalgebra of the original algebra). Here the original components
of the four-momentum [1] are replaced by the transformed quantities. The
resulting equations are amazingly simple ( in this sense our work follows
the approach of [1] where the diﬃculties encountered in an earlier work [2]
have been obviated due to a judicious choice of the appropriate κ-Poincare
algebra) and allow one to ﬁnd a very simple form of the explicit expressions
obtained in [1] for the original quantities as functions of ξ, the dispersion
equation for the old and transformed quantities. The latter turned out to
be an exact analog of the respective relation in special relativity.
The kinematic part of the respective Lorentz algebra requires an introduc-
tion of the transformed boost parameter z = z(ξ) [3]. This tells us that
phase and position sector of the κ-Poincare algebra cannot be ”diagonal-
ized” simultaneously.

2 Finite boost transformations in standard Lorentz
algebra and their relation to the BAK transfor-
mations

Our point of departure is the commutation relations [1] of κ-Poincare algebra
pertinent to the ﬁnite boost transformations :

[Nj, pr] = iδjr(

where p0, pj are the temporal and spatial components of the four-momentum,
λ is the observer-independent scale, j, r = 1, 2, 3, and Nj are the boost
generators.
We introduce new transformed quantities nj, ω, kj (where the latter repre-
sent the frequency-wave number four-vector) such that the respective com-
mutation relations are standard Lorentzian:

(1)

(2)

In the following we restrict our attention to the boost in the direction of
the axis 1. Clearly this does not lead to a loss of generality since we cam
always choose the direction of boost as the axis 1. The diﬀerential equations

[nj, kr] = iδjrω
[nj, ω] = ikj

corresponding to the diﬀerential representation of n1 are

For our purposes we rewrite commutation relations (2) in a slightly diﬀerent
form:

Therefore the diﬀerential representation of the new boost generator n1 is

where we call ¯m a generalized mass whose relation to the physical mass will
be found later.

rameter ξ we write the derivative dω

From the ﬁrst and two last equations we obtain the following two invariants:

p2eλp0 = const = k2,

p3eλp0 = const = k3

(10)

Inserting (10) into the second and third equations of (9), we obtain the
following equations in complete diﬀerentials:

yielding another invariant (Casimir operator of the original algebra) [1]:

To ﬁnd the const on the right hand side of (12) we notice that if the mo-
= 0 then energy p0 is simply particle’s mass. This gives the
mentum
constant’s value:

To ﬁnd the explicit expressions for ω and k1 we use eq.(7) to represent k1
in terms of ω and eq.(12) to represent p1 in terms of p0. Upon substitution
of the results into the ﬁrst and second equations of (9) we arrive at the
following elementary quadratures:

This expressions together with eq.(10) completely determine the transfor-
mation from pj-p0-space to kj-ω-space. If we insert (10) and 16) into the
dispersion equation (7) and take into account that for

the expression for the reduced mass in terms of the mass m [1]

¯m =

ω = ω0coshξ + k10sinhξ
k1 = k10coshξ + ω0sinhξ

We still have to express ω and k1 in terms of the boost parameter ξ. From
eqs.(3)we obtain:

(17)

(18)

where k10 and ω0 are the values of the respective quantities at ξ = 0.
Both these expressions together with the transformation rules furnished by
(17) give us (after simple algebra) the values of p0 and pj for arbitrary initial
(ξ = 0) conditions, that is for arbitrary values of pj0:

(27)

The most interesting part of this derivation is that the compatibility of (21),
(22), and (27), requires

The way out of this situation is to introduce a modiﬁed boost parameter
z = z(ξ) in x

another inertial system K.
If initially, a particle was at rest, then x/x0 = V = tanhz and comparing
this expression with eq.(21) we ﬁnd the value of the boost parameter z [3]:

z(ξ) = 2tanh

Impossibility to simultaneously introduce standard Minkowski metric in
p0-spaces is due to the fact that in the respective algebra
both x
x and x0 do not commute. Moreover, the k

structure, albeit at the expense of abandoning the standard relativistic tran-
sition

This problem was discussed in detail in [4]. In the latter the obtained dis-
persion equation diﬀered from the one used in the later studies (e.g., [1], [3])
and discussed here.

However was what not mentioned is an absence of a unique deﬁnition of the
time derivative in the presence of the minimum attainable length λ, even if
such a deﬁnition is restricted by a choice of a suitable algebra. This non-
uniqueness is an important factor in the emergence of diﬀerent dispersion
p0-space. Therefore it would look like an unpleasant fact.

However, in a transition to the correct dispersion relation ω
k-space this
diﬀerence (within the framework of the chosen algebra, κ-Poincare) does not
play any role, as will be shown below.
In general, one can deﬁne such a derivative as follows:

with the following relation between parameters α, β, and γ:

For the conventional deﬁnition of the derivative the choice of the parameters
is not important, and all diﬀerent deﬁnitions are equivalent.
In work [4] the parameters were:

α + β = γ.

α = 0, β = i, γ = i

In the subsequent studies (e.g., [1], [3]) this choice was abandoned in favor
of

We have provided an alternative (rather elementary) derivation of the results
of the work [1] using the standard Lorentz group for the representation of
the algebra governing the space ω

derivation is simpler, but more important it automatically yields both the

Interestingly enough, the non-uniqueness of the deﬁnition of the (time)
derivative in the environment with the minimum length scale does not af-

It would be interesting to investigate also a situation where one would take
into account not only the explicit inclusion of the minimum length scale into

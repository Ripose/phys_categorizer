A More Rational Scheme for C,P,T Transformations and
Elimination of Reversibility Paradox in Time Reversal
as well as T Violation in Weak Interaction

Abstract

A more rational and perfect scheme of C, P, T transformations is advanced in the manuscript. In the
new scheme, the transition probability densities are invariable under C, P, T transformations individually in
the pure sate processes of electromagnetic and strong interactions. In some processes of weak interaction
such as K 0 and B0 meson’s decays, CP and T symmetries are violated simultaneously and the violations
are just complementary. Meanwhile the Hamiltonians of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions are
completely unchanged under the united CP T transformation. On the other hand, in the processes of mix-
ing states of electromagnetic interaction, T and C symmetries are violated simultaneously owing to the
interference eﬀects of probability amplitudes between mixing states, and the T and C violations are also
complementary. In this way, the so-called reversibility paradox, i.e. time reversal is reversible in the micro-
processes but irreversible in the macro-processes, can be eliminated completely. It can also provide a more
rational foundation to explain the origin of so big asymmetry of positive and anti-matter in the current
university.

If let ψ′(~x, t) = ψ∗(~x,

unchanged under time reversal. In this case, we should have ψ′(~x, t) = αψ(~x, t). Here α is a constant and
we can take α = 1. So at present, the time reversals of wave function and the Hamiltonian are deﬁned as

If the condition is satisﬁed, we get T ψ(~x, t) = ψ∗(~x,
t) = ψ(~x, t). It means that the wave function or the
−
transition probability amplitude is unchanged under time reversal.. If the condition (7) can’t be satisﬁed, we
have T H(~x, t)T −1
= ψ(~x, t) in general. In this case, the wave function or transition
probability amplitude can’t keep unchanged under time reversal. So in the current theory, the invariability
of time reversal is actually equivalent to the invariability of the transition probability amplitude.

= H(~x, t) and T ψ(~x, t)

However, as shown below, there exist some problems in the current time reversal theory in particle
physics. At ﬁrst, it can be proved that the condition (7) can’t be satisﬁed in electromagnetic interaction
according to the present scheme of time reversal transformation. There are two kind schemes of time reversal
in current particle physics. One is based on the hypotheses that the time reversal transformations of scalar
ﬁeld ϕ, spinor ﬁeld ψ and electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ are taken as

However, in light of the common understanding and the physical experiments at present, in spite of a few
processes such as the weak decay of K 0 and B0 mesons, electromagnetic interaction processes betweem micro-
particles are unchanged under time reversal. So the current theory of time reversal must have something
wrong and has to be reestablished. The key is that it is improper for us to equal the invariability of
time reversal to the invariability of transition probability amplitude. In fact, probability amplitude is an
immeasurable quantity. What can be done directly in experiments is probability density. In spite of the
invariability of transition probability amplitude, if we take the invariability of probability density under time
reversal as the criterion of the invariability of time reversal, as shown below, we would reach a more rational
theory of time reversal.

Besides, no physical and logical reasons have been provided to explain why the deﬁnitions of time reversal
of scalar, vector and spinor ﬁelds shown in Eq.(8) and (9) are diﬀerent from Eq.(5) deﬁned in quantum
mechanics, as well as why the transformation form of spinor ﬁeld should take the form of Eq.(9). The
real situation is that the current proof of time reversal invariability is actually based on a beforehand
hypothesis that the Hamitonian of electromagnetic interaction satisﬁes the so-called invariability condition
of time reversal T
t), then the transformation form of ﬁelds are reduced. In order to
satisﬁes Eq.(9), in the present theory, the time reversal transformation of quntized spinor ﬁeld ψ(~x, t) =

On the other hand, considering the fact that T is an anti-Hermitian operator, taking the complex conjugation
of wave functions ψ(−)(~x, t) and ψ(+)(~x, t), then let T only act with bs(~p) and d+

we reach Eq.(9). However, it should be pointed out that there are two problems in the process above. Firstly,
according to Eq.(24), the creation operator is still creation operator, and the annihilation operator is still
annihilation operator after time reversal. Though it seams rational for free particles without production and
annihilation, it is improper for interaction processes. In particle physics, we construct interaction using free
particle’s wave functions in interaction representation. In interaction processes, the operators of creation
and annihilation should exchange each other. Secondly, Eq.(23) actually means

There also exist the same problems in another scheme of time reversal, the so-called Winger scheme(2),
but it is unnecessary for us to discuss it any more here. It can be said that the current scheme of time

The result is not the same as the present theory.
In present theory, momentum ~p in wave functions is
regarded as a constant and unchanged under time reversal. However, ~p is not a common constant owing to
the relation ~p = d~x/dt, so it should change a negative sign after time reversal.

The physical meaning of Eq.(73) is that when t1 > t2, the ﬁrst item acts only and a positive spinor particle

second item acts only and an anti-spinor particle is produced at point x1. Then the anti-spinor particle

It will be seen from discussion below that this diﬀerence of negative sign will pay a key role to eliminate the

Let’s now discuss the concrete form of operator T in the new scheme. By acting operator T on the motion

equation of positive particle in momentum space, and considering relations T ~pT −1 =

On the other hand, considering the fact that the wave function of spinor particle in momentum space is the
eigen function of particle’s helicity, as well as helicity are unchanged after the directions of particle’s spin

and momentum are reversed simultaneously, the form of wave function in momentum space are unchanged
when particle’s helicity is unchanged(3), i.e., we have

It can be seen from the discussions above that the motion equations of spinor ﬁelds can not keep unchanged
under time reversal according to the new scheme, for the wave function us(~p) and νs(~p) in momentum space
have been changed into their conjugate wave functions ¯us(~p) and ¯νs(~p), so the motion equations should be
changed correspondingly, though the motion equations of scalar and electromagnetic ﬁelds are unchanged
after time reversal. According to the current viewpoint, it is believed that we can always ﬁnd a time reversal
transformation (as well as C, P transformation) by means of which both the motion equation of free spinor
ﬁeld and the Hamiltonian can keep unchanged under the same transformation simultaneously. However, this
is impossible in general. In fact, it is easy to verify that the motion equation of spinor ﬁeld can not keep
unchanged under the transformation deﬁned by Eq.(9). In order to let the equation unchanged under time
(3). But we do not discuss this problem any more here. At the same
reversal, we should take T = iγ1γ2γ3
time, it is unnecessary for us to demand the motion equations unchanged under the transformations. In
fact, the motion equation unchanged means that probability amplitude is unchanged under time reversal.
But probability amplitude is a quantity that can’t be measured directly. What can be done is probability
density. If we discuss the problems from a new angle, that is, not demands the motion equation or transition
probability amplitude unchanged under the transformations, only demands the transition probability density
is unchanged under the transformation, we can reach a more rational theory. As shown below, we will
prove that though the interaction Hamiltonian can not keep unchanged under time reversal, the transition
probability densities would be unchanged in light of the new scheme.

The Hamiltonian density of electromagnetic interaction can be written as the form of ﬂow

It is obvious that the Hamiltonian can’t keep unchanged under the time reversal with the diﬀerence γµ →
and ~x
~x, so the transition probability amplitude would not be the same after time reversal. The Eq.(88)
means that as long as we substitute γµ with ¯γµ in the Feynman diagrams in the momentum space, we can
write out the S matrixes of time reversal processes directly. The result is equal to reverse the momentum
directions of all particles in the time reversal processes. By the way, it should be emphases that it is
improper for us not to consider the transformation of γµ matrixes in the current time reversal (as well as
C, P transformations). When we carry out the transformation of the motion equation of spinor ﬁels, we
have to consider the transformation of γµ matrixes, why do we not consider it in the transformation of the
Hmiltonian? For the consistency, the transformation of γµ matrix should be considered. On the other hand,
taking the imaginary conjugation of ﬂow Jµ(x), and considering the relation γ4γµ = ¯γµγ4, we can get

We deﬁne the single processes such as the interaction processes between electron-electron, or electron-

have the same initial and ﬁnal stares, but their medial states are diﬀerent. It can be proved below that the
transition probability density would be unchanged in the pure state processes under time reversal. The low
order processes of electromagnetic interaction are discussed at ﬁrst. We can discuss the problems of time
reversal in momentum space directly in light of the new scheme. For the two order process of electron-electron

The probability density is also unchanged. For more complex high-order processes, we take following ﬁgures
as an example.

Fig.2 and 3 can be derived from Fig.1, so they are the processes of pure states with the same initial and
ﬁnal states. The total transition probability amplitudes before and after time reversal are

pure state processes with both odd and even numbers of internal Fermion lines simultaneously. So after
time reversal, the total probability amplitude can always be written as ST =
i and we
always have S+
T ST = SS+. In this way, the transition probability densities are always unchanged under time
reversal, no matter how complex the pure state processes are. In fact, in the current theory and experiment
of particle physics, all we involve are the processes of pure states. That is the reason why we can say that
electromagnetic interaction (as well as strong interaction) is invariable under time reversal.

But for the processes of non-pure states, or mixing states with diﬀerent initial and ﬁnal states, the sit-
uation is completely diﬀerent. In this case, some Feynman diagrams may have the odd number of internal
Fermion lines, while the other may have the even number of internal Fermion lines, so that the symmetries
of time reversals would be destroyed. Let’s show this conclusion by considering the processes containing
electron-electron scattering and electron-photon scattering. Let ST represent the total transition probabil-
ity amplitude, S1T represent the transition probability amplitude of electron-electron scattering shown in
Eq.(92), S2T represent the transition probability amplitude of electron-photon scattering shown in Eq.(95),
we have S = S1 + S2, ST = S1T + S2T , as well as S1T =

The transition probability densities before and after time reversal are diﬀerent. Meanwhile, because T

In this way, the problem of so-called reversibility paradox can be solved well. The paradox is based on

motions is reversible. So when the velocity directions of all particles in an isolated macro-system are reversed,
the system would evolve along the completely opposite direction, so that the evolution of isolated macro-
system would be reversible. However, what can be seen in the practical processes is that the evolution of
isolated macro-system always irreversible. The paradox has puzzled physical circle for a long time, many
explanations have been put forward, but none of them is satisﬁed up to now.

According to the new scheme of time reversal, macro-systems consist of mixing states and the radios
of mixing states are diﬀerent in general. For example, there exist interactions between electron-electron,
electron-photon, electron-proton, photon-proton and so on. The interferences between the mixing states in
the low order processes would greatly violate the symmetry of time reversal, leading to the irreversibility of
system’s evolution. Therefore, the irreversibility of macro-system’s evolution comes from the irreversibility
of micro-processes. In this way, there exists no so-called reversibility paradox again.

The transition probability amplitude of weak interaction between four fermions in low order process, for

Therefore, we still have ST = S+ and S+
T ST = S+S, transition probability density is unchanged under time
reversal. It can be proved that the results are the same in high order processes of weak interaction between
leptons, but we do not discuss them any more here.

For weak interaction between quarks, let uk = (u, c, t), dk = (d, s, b) in light of the standard model, after

the CKM matrix is introduced, the charged current of quarks are

So there exists no T violation after time reversal. At present, T violation has been founded in the decay pro-
π+π−e+e− angle connection(4). But T violation can’t be automatically
cesses of K 0
and generally obtained from the current theory of T transformation. In the current theory, we only think
that because CP is violated in weak interaction, so T would also be violated owing to the presupposition
that the weak interaction is symmetry under the CP T united transformation. We usually discuss T violation
based on analyses of odd-even characters of time reversal processes in some special problems(5). According
to the new scheme, T violation appears automatically in weak interaction, which is independent of CP T
invariability.

transformation also has some faults. At ﬁrst, the Eq.(139) is actually the deﬁnition of parity transformation,
not the proof of parity invariability. Parity invariability actually demands P

proof is provided at present. Secondly, why P operator only change the directions of momentum ~p in a+(~p)

The Hamiltonian can’t keep unchanged under P . The result is the same as the current theory, and so do as

The Hamiltonian is unchanged under P . The result is also the same as the current theory.

However, the problem of the parity of gauge ﬁelds is worthy of being discussed again. According to
Eq.(151), ~A is regarded as a vector relative to electric current, so ~A changes its sign under P . But A4 is
considered as a scalar relative to charge density.
It does not change sign under P . However, quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld is used to describer photon in the quantum theory of ﬁeld, in which A1 and A2 are
considered to describe transverse photons, A3 and A4 are considered to describe longitudinal and time
1 and
photons. At present, the parity of transverse photons and longitudinal photons are considered to be
the parity of time photons is considered to be +1. However, because photons do not carry charges, it is
unnecessary for us to think that A4 is used to describe charge density. We don’t think that the photons
described by A4 have something diﬀerent from the photons described by ~A. For the identiﬁcation of theory,
all photon’s parity should be the same and regarded as

1, no matter what kind of photons.

So it is obvious that Eq.(175) depends on electric current and charge densities but Eq.(176) has nothing to do
with electric current and charges. When we discuss free photon ﬁeld, there is no charge distribution in space.
The photon ﬁelds is only determined by Eq.(173) and (176), so its transformation is not restricted by relation

In fact, from the deﬁnition of momentum ~p = d~x/dt, both T and P transformation lead to the same ~p

It can be said that both T and P transformation are equivalent from the angle observed in momentum space.
So we always regard the processes of time reversal as one in which the directions of all particle’s velocities
are reversed. But the P transformastion of the ﬁelds Aa
µ(x) is still described by Eq.(151). In fact, in the
quantum theory of ﬁeld, electric current density is actually described by spinor ﬁelds with jµ = e ¯ψγµψ. By

without so simple solutions like Eq.(175) and (176). So their parities of the fourth dimension are also not
restricted by relation P ρP −1 = ρ. Because parity is regarded as the inherent nature of micro-particle, for
the identiﬁcation of theory, we should also deﬁne the P transformation or parities of non-Abelian gauge

At ﬁrst, for the processes with photon propagation lines in the Feynman diagrams, for example, the
process of electron-electron scatting, the transition probability amplitude is described by Eq.(91). By the
relation ¯γµ¯γµ = γµγµ, it is easy to see that we have SP = P SP −1 =
P SP = S+S under the
transformation of Eq.(182). So the transition probability density is invariable. For the processes with
electron propagation lines in the Feynman diagrams, for example, the process of the Compton scattering,
S under the transformation of
the transition probability amplitude is described by Eq.(94), we have SP 6
Eq.(182). But the statistical average about photon’s polarizations should be considered when we calcalate
the transition probability densities. By using relation ¯γµ¯γµ = γµγµ and

So the transition probability density is still unchanged. It can also be proved that in the pure state processes
of high orders electromagnetic interaction, the transition probability densities are unchanged under the
transformation of Eq.(182). Therefore, electromagnetic interaction is unchanged under the transformation
of Eq.(182). As for strong interaction, by using Eq.(181), Eq.(171) becomes

3. C Transformation

According to the current C transformation, the motion equation of spinor a positive particle with charge

e moving in the electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ(x) is

The operator C satisﬁes the relation

By means of relations (192) and (193), Eq.(191)can be transformed into Eq.(190), that is to say, the spinor
positive and anti-particles satisﬁes the same motion equation. On the other hand, scalar ﬁeld is unchanged
under C, the C transformations of imaginary scalar ﬁelds and electromagnetic ﬁeld are deﬁned as follows in
the current theory

CAµ(x)C−1 =

Aµ(x)

−

Cϕ+(x)C−1 = ϕ(x)

Cϕ(x)C−1 = ϕ+(x)

(194)

In this way, it can be proved that the Hamiltonians of electromagnetic interaction and strong interaction are
unchanged under C, but the Hamiltonians of weak interaction can’t keep unchanged.

This kind of transformation also has two shortcomings. The ﬁrst is that the physical meaning of the C
transformation of quantized spinor ﬁelds is unclear, or can be said wrong. According to the standard pressure
of C transformation in current theory, by using Eq.(192) and considering relations(1) γ2u∗
s(~p) = νs(~p),
γ2ν∗

s (~p) = us(~p), we have

ψC (x) = γ2ψ∗(x) =

[νs(~p)bs(~p)e−ip·x + us(~p)d+

s (~p)eip·x]

(195)

On the other hand, according to the current understanding, operator C is only acted on bs(~p) and d+
we get

s (~p),

Cψ(x)C−1 =

[us(~p)Cbs(~p)C−1eip·x + νs(~p)d+

s (~p)C−1e−ip·x]

(196)

Let Eq.(195) and (196) to be equal to each other, we get Cbs(~p)C−1 = d+
s (~p)C−1 = b(~p).
It means that the annihilation operator bs(~p) of a spinor positive particle is transformed into the creation
operator d+

Secondly, according to the current theory, the free spinor positive particle and free spinor anti-particle

satisfy two diﬀerent motion equations in momentum space

But they satisfy the same equation in coordinate space.

the energy levels of hydrogen atoms can also be obtained. Eq.(203) means that for anti-particles, the current

There also exist the so-called negative energy problem with E =
of negative energy, Dirac put forward the ideas of the negative energy sea and hole theory. The theory
considers that vacuum is actually full of negative energy particles. When a particle with negative energy
leaps out of the sea, a hole is left, meaning that an anti-particle is produced. Though the theory can explain
the problem of negative energy, it can’t be satisﬁed.

By the symmetrization of the Dirac equation in coordinate space, the problem of negative energy can be

This is just the motion equation of free spinor anti-particle in momentum space, but the energy of anti-
particle is positive. So it is obvious that as long as corresponding relation Eq.(205) is introduced, the
problem of negative energy can be solved well and the Dirac theory becomes more symmetric and perfect.
Because the transition probability in particle physics are always calculated in momentum space, and the
motion equation of spinor ﬁeld in momentum space is unchanged, the symmetrization of the Dirac equations
in coordinate space does not aﬀect the practical calculating results of transition probabilities.

Based on the symmetrization of the Dirac equations in coordinate space, we can establish a new C

transformation. The fundamental natures of C transformation are:

1.The creation and annihilation operators of positive and anti-particles exchange each other.
2.The wave functions of positive and anti-particles in momentum space exchange each other.
For free real scalar ﬁeld, the wave function of anti-particle is itself and is unchanged under C. For
quantized free imaginary scalar ﬁeld, b+(~p) is the creation operator of anti-particle, a+(~p) is the creation
operator of positive particle, we should have Cb+(~p)C−1 = a+(~p), so

The diﬀerence of negative sign would lead to C violation in the processes of mixing states in electromagnetic
interaction as shown in T transformation. So it will pay an important role for us to explain why our university
mainly consists of positive material at present. In the evolution theory of university, this is a fundamental
problem. According to the observation, the present university mainly consists of positive material, but in the
early phase of university, the positive and anti-material should be the same by the consideration of rationality.
In order to evolve from the state that positive and anti-material are symmetric into the state that positive
and anti-material are unsymmetric, big C and CP violations are needed simultaneously. But up to now, only
a small CP violation is found in the decay processes of K 0 and B0 mesons. It seams not enough to explain
so big unsymmetry of positive and anti-material of the present university. According to the new scheme,
in the mixing states of electromagnetic interaction, for example, there exist interactions between electron
(positive electron)-electron (positive electron) scattering, electron (positive electron)-photon scattering, and
electron—positive electron annihilation and so on. In theses cases, some Feynman digrams may have the odd
number of internal Fermion lines while the other may have the even number, so that the symmetries would
be destroyed under C by the interference eﬀects between mixing states. Because electromagnetic interaction
is unchanged under P , this kind of C violation also means CP violation at the same time. And because the
interferences appear in the low order processes, C and CP violations are big enough to lead to the current
great unsymmetry of universal positive and anti-materials, though according to the current scheme of C
transformation, there is no such violation.

The matrix form of operator C is discussed below. The C transformation of motion equation of spinor

anti-particle in momentum space is

So the Hamiltonians of weak interactions between leptons can’t keep unchanged under C. The result is
similar to the current theory except a diﬀerence of negative sign. The situation is similar for the weak
interaction between quarks.

The C transformation of the QCD theory of strong interaction is discussed at last. Because C transfor-
mation has nothing to do with λρ, we have CλρC−1 = λρ. Considering the fact that the matrix elements of

that the transition probability density is unchanged under C. But for mixing states with the overlapping

There is only a diﬀerence of negative sign between Eq.(242)and (243). The transition probability density is

4. United Transformation, CP and T violations

Therefore, in the new scheme, we have

CP T = (iγ2γ4)(γ4)(iγ1γ3γ4) = γ5

as well as

CP T γµ(CP T )−1 =

γµ

CP T γ5(CP T )−1 = γ5

the other quantities change a negative sign. Though the diﬀerence W ±
µ (x) does not aﬀect the
calculation results of transition probabilities, it is still unsymmetrical and had better to be improved further
in order to reach a complete symmetry. We can do it by the following consideration.

But the P, C transformations of W ±

µ (x) are still presented by Eq.(181) and (239). Thus, we have

Therefore, the CP T transformation of the Hamiltonian of strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions
becomes at last

It means that the Hamiltonians of interactions are completely unchanged under the united CP T transfor-
mation. In fact, in the new scheme, all quantities used to structure the Hamiltonian either are unchanged or
only change a negative sign under CP T . Because the products of γµ and gauge ﬁelds Aµ(x), W ±
µ and
Bρ
µ(x) are unchanged, and spinor ﬁelds and γ5 are unchanged under CP T , the new CP T invariability, with
a universal signiﬁcance, has nothing to do with the concrete forms of the Hamiltonians which is structured
by the products of whose quantities. Comparing with the current result

µ (x), Z 0

CP T

(x)(CP T )−1 =

it is obvious that Eq.(256) is more symmetric and prefect. Eq.(256) means that the transition probability
amplitudes are unchanged under CP T , while Eq.(257) means that the transition probability densities are
unchanged under CP T , so the CP T invariability in new scheme is more strict invariability.

On the other hand, by means of Eq.(254), the time reversal of the Hamiltonian of weak interaction

between leptons become

Comparing with the current result, the diﬀerence is only at γµ →
¯γµ, but as mentioned above, this kind of
diﬀerence does not aﬀect the calculating result of probability densities. Because Ujk is an imaginary matrix
with U ∗
= Ujk for some matrix elements, in a certain cases, the symmetry of the CP transformation would
be violated. The situation is the same as the T violation mentioned before, and T violation and CP violation
are just complementary in new scheme. And so do for strong interaction and electromagnetic interaction.

jk 6

In sum, based on the new scheme, we can solve the problems of reversibility paradox, negative energy,
unsymmetry of positive and anti-material in the current university and T violation in weak interaction in a
united form, and the theoretical structure is also more rational and symmetrical than the current scheme.

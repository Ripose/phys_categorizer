Abstract

The new Process Physics provides a new explanation of space as a quantum foam system
in which gravity is an inhomogeneous ﬂow of the quantum foam into matter. An analysis
of various experiments demonstrates that absolute motion relative to space has been
observed experimentally by Michelson and Morley, Miller, Illingworth, Torr and Kolen,
and by DeWitte. The Dayton Miller and Roland DeWitte data also reveal the in-ﬂow
of space into matter which manifests as gravity. The in-ﬂow also manifests turbulence
and the experimental data conﬁrms this as well, which amounts to the observation of
a gravitational wave phenomena. The Einstein assumptions leading to the Special and
General Theory of Relativity are shown to be falsiﬁed by the extensive experimental
data. Contrary to the Einstein assumptions absolute motion is consistent with relativistic
eﬀects, which are caused by actual dynamical eﬀects of absolute motion through the
quantum foam, so that it is Lorentzian relativity that is seen to be essentially correct.

Introduction

The new Process Physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] provides a new expla-
nation of space as a quantum foam system in which gravity is an inhomogeneous ﬂow
of the quantum foam into matter. Here an analysis of data from various experiments
demonstrates that absolute motion relative to space has been observed by Michelson
and Morley, Miller, Illingworth, Torr and Kolen, and by DeWitte, contrary to common
belief within physics that absolute motion has never been observed. The Dayton Miller
and Roland DeWitte data also reveal the in-ﬂow of space into matter which manifests
as gravity. The experimental data suggests that the in-ﬂow manifest turbulence, which
amounts to the observation of a gravitational wave phenomena. The Einstein assump-
tions leading to the Special and General Theory of Relativity are shown to be falsiﬁed
by the extensive experimental data.

Contrary to the Einstein assumptions absolute motion is consistent with relativistic
eﬀects, which are caused by actual dynamical eﬀects of absolute motion through the
quantum foam. Lorentzian relativity is seen to be essentially correct.
This paper is a condensed version of certain sections of Cahill [1].

2 Detection of Absolute Motion

2.1 Space and Absolute Motion

Absolute motion is motion relative to space itself. It turns out that Michelson and Morley
in their historic experiment of 1887 did detect absolute motion, but rejected their own
ﬁndings because using Galilean relativity the determined speed of some 8 km/s was less
than the 30 km/s orbital speed of the Earth. The data was clearly indicating that the
theory for the operation of the Michelson interferometer was not adequate. Rather than
reaching this conclusion Michelson and Morley came to the incorrect conclusion that
their results amounted to the failure to detect absolute motion. This had an enormous
impact on the deveopment of physics, for as is well known Einstein adopted the absence
of absolute motion eﬀects as one of his fundamnetal assumptions. By the time Miller had
ﬁnally ﬁgured out how to use and properly analyse data from his Michelosn interferometer
absolute motion had become a forbidden concept within physics, as it still is at present.
The experimental observations by Miller and others of absolute motion has continued to
be scorned and rejected by the physics community. Unfortunately as well as revealing
absolute motion the experimental data also reveals evidence in support of a new theory
of gravity.

2.2 Theory of the Michelson Interferometer

We now show for the ﬁrst time in over 100 years how the three key eﬀects together
permit the Michelson interferometer [14] to reveal the phenomenon of absolute motion
when operating in the presence of a gas, with the third eﬀect only discovered in 2002 [9].

Figure 1: Schematic diagrams of the Michelson Interferometer, with beamsplitter/mirror
at A and mirrors at B and C, on equal length arms when parallel, from A. D is a
quantum detector (not drawn in (b)) that causes localisation of the photon state by a
collapse process. In (a) the interferometer is at rest in space. In (b) the interferometer
is moving with speed v relative to space in the direction indicated. Interference fringes
are observed at the quantum detector D. If the interferometer is rotated in the plane
through 90o, the roles of arms AC and AB are interchanged, and during the rotation
shifts of the fringes are seen in the case of absolute motion, but only if the apparatus
operates in a gas. By counting fringe changes the speed v may be determined.

The main outcome is the derivation of the origin of the Miller k2 factor in the expression
for the time diﬀerence for light travelling via the orthogonal arms,

Here vP is the projection of the absolute velocity v of the interferometer through the
quantum-foam onto the plane of the interferometer, where the projected velocity vector
vP has azimuth angle ψ relative to the local meridian, and θ is the angle of one arm
from that meridian. The k2 factor is k2 = n(n2
1) where n is the refractive index of
the gas through which the light passes, L is the length of each arm and c is the speed
of light relative to the quantum foam. This expression follows from three key eﬀects:
(i) the diﬀerence in geometrical length of the two paths when the interferometer is in
absolute motion, as ﬁrst realised by Michelson, (ii) the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction of
the arms along the direction of motion, and (iii) that these two eﬀects precisely cancel
in vacuum, but leave a residual eﬀect if operated in a gas, because the speed of light
through the gas is reduced to V = c/n, ignoring here for simplicity any Fresnel-drag
eﬀects, see [1]. This is one of the aspects of the quantum foam physics that distinguishes
it from the Einstein formalism. The time diﬀerence ∆t is revealed by the fringe shifts
on rotating the interferometer. In Newtonian physics, that is with no Fitzgerald-Lorentz
contraction, k2 = n3, while in Einsteinian physics k = 0 reﬂecting the fundamental
assumption that absolute motion is not measurable and indeed has no meaning. The
Special Relativity null eﬀect for the interferometer is explicitly derived in [1]. So the
experimentally determined value of k is a key test of fundamental physics. Table 1
summarises the diﬀerences between the three fundamental theories in their modelling

6

of time, space, gravity and the quantum, together with their distinctive values for the
interferometer parameter k2. For air n = 1.00029, and so for process physics k = 0.0241
and k2 = 0.00058, which is close to the Einsteinian value of k = 0, particularly in
comparison to the Newtonian value of k = 1.0. This small but non-zero k value explains
why the Michelson interferometer experiments gave such small fringe shifts. Fortunately
it is possible to check the n dependence of k as one experiment [17] was done in Helium
gas, and this has an n2

1 value signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of air.

In deriving (2) in the new physics it is essential to note that space is a quantum-foam
system which exhibits various subtle features. In particular it exhibits real dynamical
eﬀects on clocks and rods. In this physics the speed of light is only c relative to the
quantum-foam, but to observers moving with respect to this quantum-foam the speed
appears to be still c, but only because their clocks and rods are aﬀected by the quantum-
foam. As shown in [1] such observers will ﬁnd that records of observations of distant
events will be described by the Einstein spacetime formalism, but only if they restrict
measurements to those achieved by using clocks, rods and light pulses, that is using the
Einstein measurement protocol. However if they use an absolute motion detector then
such observers can correct for these eﬀects.

It is simplest in the new physics to work in the quantum-foam frame of reference. If
there is a gas present at rest in this frame, such as air, then the speed of light in this
frame is V = c/n. If the interferometer and gas are moving with respect to the quantum
foam, as in the case of an interferometer attached to the Earth, then the speed of light
relative to the quantum-foam is still V = c/n up to corrections due to drag eﬀects. Hence
this new physics requires a diﬀerent method of analysis from that of the Einstein physics.
With these cautions we now describe the operation of a Michelson interferometer in this
new physics, and show that it makes predictions diﬀerent to that of the Einstein physics.
Of course experimental evidence is the ﬁnal arbiter in this conﬂict of theories.

As shown in Fig.2 the beamsplitter/mirror when at A sends a photon ψ(t) into a
superposition ψ(t) = ψ1(t) + ψ2(t), with each component travelling in diﬀerent arms of
the interferometer, until they are recombined in the quantum detector which results in
a localisation process, and one spot in the detector is produced. Repeating with many
photons reveals that the interference between ψ1 and ψ2 at the detector results in fringes.
These fringes actually only appear if the mirrors are not quite orthogonal, otherwise the
screen has a uniform intensity and this intensity changes as the interferometer is rotated,
as shown in the analysis by Hicks [18]. To simplify the analysis here assume that the two
arms are constructed to have the same lengths L when they are physically parallel to each
other and perpendicular to v, so that the distance BB′ is L sin(θ). The Fitzgerald-Lorentz
eﬀect in the new physics is that the distance SB′ is γ−1L cos(θ) where γ = 1/
v2/c2.

physics is only for the special case of photons travelling in vacuum for which V = c.
However if the interferometer is immersed in a gas then V < c and a non-null eﬀect is
= 0. It is essential then in analysing
expected on rotating the apparatus, since now ∆t

that is k2 = n(n2
1), which gives k = 0 for vacuum experiments (n = 1). So the Miller
phenomenological parameter k is seen to accommodate both the Fitzgerald-Lorentz con-
traction eﬀect and the dielectric eﬀect, at least for gases1. This is very fortunate since
being a multiplicative parameter a re-scaling of old analyses is all that is required. ∆t
is non-zero when n
= 1 because the refractive index eﬀect results in incomplete cancel-
lation of the geometrical eﬀect and the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect. Of course
it was this cancellation eﬀect that Fitzgerald and Lorentz actually used to arrive at the
length contraction hypothesis, but they failed to take the next step and note that the
cancellation would be incomplete in the air operated Michelson-Morley experiment. In
a bizarre development modern Michelson interferometer experiments, which use reso-
nant cavities rather than interference eﬀects, but for which the analysis here is easily
adapted, and with the same consequences, are operated in vacuum mode. That denies
these experiments the opportunity to see absolute motion eﬀects. Nevertheless the ex-
perimentalists continue to misinterpret their null results as evidence against absolute
motion. Of course these experiments are therefore restricted to merely checking the
Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect, and this is itself of some interest.

All data from gas-mode interferometer experiments, except for that of Miller, has
been incorrectly analysed using only the ﬁrst eﬀect as in Michelson’s initial theoretical
treatment, and so the consequences of the other two eﬀects have been absent. Repeating
the above analysis without these two eﬀects we arrive at the Newtonian-physics time
diﬀerence which, for v << V , is

∆t = 2Ln3 v2

c3 cos(2θ) + O(v4),

that is k2 = n3. The value of ∆t, which is typically of order 10−17s in gas-mode interfer-
ometers corresponding to a fractional fringe shift, is deduced from analysing the fringe
shifts, and then the speed vM has been extracted using (5), instead of the correct form
(4) or more generally (2). However it is very easy to correct for this oversight. From (4)
and (5) we obtain for the corrected absolute (projected) speed vP through space, and for

For air the correction factor in (6) is signiﬁcant, and even more so for Helium.

1For Michelson interferometers using light propagation through solids such as plastic or optical
ﬁbres there is evidence, discussed in [1], that another eﬀect comes into operation, namely a non-
isotropic change of refractive index that causes absolute motion eﬀects to be completely cancelled.

2.3 The Michelson-Morley Experiment: 1887

Michelson and Morley reported that their interferometer experiment in 1887 gave a
‘null-result’ which since then, with rare exceptions, has been claimed to support the
Einstein assumption that absolute motion has no meaning. However to the contrary the
Michelson-Morley published data [15] shows non-null eﬀects, but much smaller than they
expected. They made observations of thirty-six 3600 turns using an L = 11 meter length
interferometer operating in air in Cleveland (Latitude 41030′N) with six turns near 12 :00
hrs (7:00 hrs ST) on each day of July 8, 9 and 11, 1887 and similarly near 18 :00 hrs
(13:00 hrs ST) on July 8, 9 and 12, 1887. Each turn took approximately 6 minutes as
the interferometer slowly rotated ﬂoating on a tank of mercury. They published and
analysed the average of each of the 6 data sets. The fringe shifts were extremely small
but within their observational capabilities.

Table 2 shows examples of the averaged fringe shift micrometer readings every 22.50

of rotation of the Michelson-Morley interferometer [15] for July 11 12:00 hr local time
and also for July 9 18:00 hr local time. The orientation of the stone slab base is indicated
by the marks 16, 1, 2, ... North is mark 16. The dominant eﬀect was a uniform fringe
drift caused by temporal temperature eﬀects on the length of the arms, and imposed
upon that are the fringe shifts corresponding to the eﬀects of absolute motion, as shown
in Fig.3.

k = 0, 1, 2, .., 8
}
{

This temperature eﬀect can be removed by subtracting from the data in each case
for the ﬁrst 00 to 1800 part of each
a best ﬁt to the data of a + bk,
rotation data set. Then multiplying by 0.02 for the micrometer thread calibration gives
the fringe-shift data points in Fig.5. This factor of 0.02 converts the micrometer readings
to fringe shifts expressed as fractions of a wavelength. Similarly a linear ﬁt has been made
to the data from the 1800 to 3600 part of each rotation data set. Separating the full 3600
rotation into two 1800 parts reduces the eﬀect of the temperature drift not being perfectly
linear in time.

In the new physics there are four main velocities that contribute to the total velocity:

v = vcosmic + vtangent

vin

vE.

(7)

Here vcosmic is the velocity of the Solar system relative to some cosmologically deﬁned
galactic quantum-foam system (discussed later) while the other three are local eﬀects:
(i) vtangent is the tangential orbital velocity of the Earth about the Sun, (ii) vin is a
quantum-gravity radial in-ﬂow of the quantum foam past the Earth towards the Sun,
and (iii) the corresponding quantum-foam in-ﬂow into the Earth is vE and makes no con-
tribution to a horizontally operated interferometer, assuming the velocity superposition
approximation2 discussed in [1]. The minus signs in (7) arise because, for example, the
in-ﬂow towards the Sun requires the Earth to have an outward directed velocity against
that in-ﬂow in order to maintain a ﬁxed distance from the Sun, as shown in Fig.4. For
circular orbits and using in-ﬂow form of Newtonian gravity the speeds vtangent and vin
are given by

inhomogeneities in the ﬂow. These expressions give vtangent = 30km/s, vin = 42.4km/s

data, computed for the latitude of Cleveland, using the Miller direction (see later) for
vcosmic of Right Ascension and Declination (α = 4hr54′, δ =
70030′) and incorporating
the tangential and in-ﬂow velocity eﬀects for July. The magnitude of the theoretical
curves are in general in good agreement with the magnitudes of the experimental data,
excluding those cases where the data does not have the sinusoidal form. However there
are signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the azimuth angle. These ﬂuctuations are also present in
the Miller data, and together suggest that this is a real physical phenomenon, and not
solely due to diﬃculties with the operation of the interferometer.

The Michelson-Morley interferometer data clearly shows the characteristic sinusoidal
form with period 1800 together with a large speed. Ignoring the eﬀect of the refractive
index, namely using the Newtonian value of k = 1, gives speeds reduced by the factor kair,
namely kairvP = 0.0241
330km/s = 7.9 km/s. Michelson and Morley reported speeds
in the range 5km/s - 7.5km/s. These slightly smaller speeds arise because they averaged
all the 7:00 hr (ST) data, and separately all the 13:00 hr (ST) data, whereas here some
of the lower quality data has not been used. Michelson was led to the false conclusion

that because this speed of some 8 km/s was considerably less than the orbital speed of
30 km/s the interferometer must have failed to have detected absolute motion, and that
the data was merely caused by experimental imperfections. This was the ﬂawed analysis
that led to the incorrect conclusion by Michelson and Morley that the experiment had
failed to detect absolute motion. The consequences for physics were extremely damaging,
and are only now being rectiﬁed after some 115 years.

2.4 The Miller Interferometer Experiment: 1925-1926

Dayton Miller developed and operated a Michelson interferometer for over twenty years
with an eﬀective arm length of L = 32m achieved by multiple reﬂections. The steel
arms weighed 1200 kilograms and ﬂoated in a tank of 275 kilograms of Mercury. The
main sequence of observations being on Mt.Wilson in the years 1925-1926, with the
results reported in 1933 by Miller [16]. Miller developed his huge interferometer over the
years, from 1902 to 1906 in collaboration with Morley, and later at Mt.Wilson where the
most extensive interferometer observations were carried out. Miller was meticulous in
perfecting the operation of the interferometer and performed many control experiments.
The biggest problem to be controlled was the eﬀect of temperature changes on the lengths
of the arms. It was essential that the temperature eﬀects were kept as small as possible,
but so long as each turn was performed suﬃciently quickly, any temperature eﬀect could
be assumed to have been linear with respect to the angle of rotation. Then a uniform
background fringe drift could be removed, as in the Michelson-Morley data analysis (see
Fig.3).

In all some 200,000 readings were taken during some 12,000 turns of the interfer-
ometer. Analysis of the data requires the extraction of the speed vM and the azimuth
angle ψ by eﬀectively ﬁtting the observed time diﬀerences, obtained from the observed

14

fringe shifts, using (2), but with k = 1. Miller was of course unaware of the full theory of
the interferometer and so he assumed the Newtonian theory, which neglected both the
Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction and air eﬀects.

2

−

Miller performed this analysis of his data by hand, and the results for April, August
and September 1925 and February 1926 are shown in Fig.7. The speeds shown are the
Michelson speeds vM , and these are easily corrected for the two neglected eﬀects by
dividing these vM by kair = √(n2
1) = 0.0241, as in (6). Then for example a speed of
vM = 10km/s gives vP = vM /kair = 415km/s. However this correction procedure was
not available to Miller. He understood that the theory of the Michelson interferometer
was not complete, and so he introduced the phenomenological parameter k in (2). We
shall denote his values by k. Miller noted, in fact, that k
<< 1, as we would now expect.
Miller then proceeded on the assumption that v should have only two components: (i)
a cosmic velocity of the Solar system through space, and (ii) the orbital velocity of the
Earth about the Sun. Over a year this vector sum would result in a changing v, as was
in fact observed, see Fig.7. Further, since the orbital speed was known, Miller was able
to extract from the data the magnitude and direction of v as the orbital speed oﬀered
16hr is
an absolute scale. For example the dip in the vM plots for sidereal times τ
a clear indication of the direction of v, as the dip arises at those sidereal times when
the projection vP of v onto the plane of the interferometer is at a minimum. During a
24hr period the value of vP varies due to the Earth’s rotation. As well the vM plots vary
throughout the year because the vectorial sum of the Earth’s orbital velocity vtangent
and the cosmic velocity vcosmic changes. There are two eﬀects here as the direction of
vtangent is determined by both the yearly progression of the Earth in its orbit about the
Sun, and also because the plane of the ecliptic is inclined at 23.50 to the celestial plane.
Figs.8 show the expected theoretical variation of both vP and the azimuth ψ during one
sidereal day in the months of April, August, September and February. These plots show
the clear signature of absolute motion eﬀects as seen in the actual interferometer data of
Fig.7.

≈

Note that the above corrected Miller projected absolute speed of approximately vP =
415km/s is completely consistent with the corrected projected absolute speed of some
330km/s from the Michelson-Morley experiment, though neither Michelson nor Miller
were able to apply this correction. The diﬀerence in magnitude is completely explained
by Cleveland having a higher latitude than Mt. Wilson, and also by the only two sidereal
times of the Michelson-Morley observations. So from his 1925-1926 observations Miller
had completely conﬁrmed the true validity of the Michelson-Morley observations and
was able to conclude, contrary to their published conclusions, that the 1887 experiment
had in fact detected absolute motion. But it was too late. By then the physicists had
incorrectly come to believe that absolute motion was inconsistent with various ‘relativistic
eﬀects’ that had by then been observed. This was because the Einstein formalism had
been ‘derived’ from the assumption that absolute motion was without meaning and so
unobservable in principle. Of course the earlier interpretation of relativistic eﬀects by
Lorentz had by then lost out to the Einstein interpretation.

Figure 7: Miller’s results from the 1925-1926 observations of absolute motion showing
the projected ‘Michelson’ speed vM in km/s and azimuth angle ψ in degrees plotted
against sidereal time in hours. The results are for April, August and September 1925
and February 1926.
In most cases the results arise from observations extending over
much of each month, i.e not from a single day in each month. Therefore the data points
are not strictly in chronological order. The lines joining the data points are merely to
make the data points clearer. The smoother line is a running time average computed
by Miller. The ﬂuctuations in both vM and ψ appear to be a combination of apparatus
eﬀects and genuine physical phenomena caused by turbulence in the gravitational in-ﬂow
of space towards the Sun. Each data point arises from analysis of the average of twenty
full rotations of the interferometer. The speed data for September is re-plotted in Fig.9
showing the corrected absolute speed.

As already noted Miller was led to the conclusion that for reasons unknown the existing
theory of the Michelson interferometer did not reveal true values of vP , and for this
reason he introduced the parameter k, with k indicating his numerical values. Miller had
reasoned that he could determine both vcosmic and k by observing the interferometer
determined vP and ψ over a year because the known orbital velocity of the Earth about
the Sun would modulate both of these observables, and by a scaling argument he could
determine the absolute velocity of the Solar system. In this manner he ﬁnally determined
70033′). However now
that
that the theory of the Michelson interferometer has been revealed an anomaly becomes
apparent. Table 3 shows v = vM /kair for each of the four epochs, giving speeds consistent
with the revised Michelson-Morley data. However Table 3 also shows that k and the
speeds v = vM /k determined by the scaling argument are considerably diﬀerent. Here the
vM values arise after taking account of the projection eﬀect. That k is considerably larger
than the value of kair indicates that another velocity component has been overlooked.
Miller of course only knew of the tangential orbital speed of the Earth, whereas the new
physics predicts that as-well there is a quantum-gravity radial in-ﬂow vin of the quantum
foam. We can re-analyse Miller’s data to extract a ﬁrst approximation to the speed of
tangent that sets the scale and not
this in-ﬂow component. Clearly it is vR =
vtangent, and because k = vM /vtangent and kair = vM /vR are the scaling relations, then

obtained from Miller’s original data which was found in 2002. The dip at τ
is also seen in the New Bedford data, Fig.12, and the DeWitte data, Fig.13. So three
diﬀerent experiments reveal the same absolute motion signature. The ﬂuctuations in
vP appear to be a combination of experimental eﬀects and genuine physical phenomena
caused by turbulence in the gravitational in-ﬂow of space towards the Sun.

Using the k values in Table 3 and the value3 of kair we obtain the vin speeds shown
in Table 3, which give an average speed of 54 km/s, compared to the ‘Newtonian’ in-ﬂow
speed of 42 km/s. Note that the in-ﬂow interpretation of the anomaly predicts that
k = (vR/vtangent) kair = √3 kair = 0.042. Of course this simple re-scaling of the Miller
results is not completely valid because (i) the direction of vR is of course diﬀerent to that
of vtangent, and also not necessarily orthogonal to vtangent because of turbulence, and (ii)
also because of turbulence we would expect some contribution from the in-ﬂow eﬀect of
the Earth itself, namely that it is not always perpendicular to the Earth’s surface, and
so would give a contribution to a horizontally operated interferometer.

Mt.Wilson. This weather information was not recorded by Miller. The temperature and pressure

An analysis that properly searches for the in-ﬂow velocity eﬀect clearly requires a
complete re-analysis of the Miller data, and this is now possible and underway at Flinders
University as the original data sheets have been found.
It should be noted that the
70033′), namely (α = 17hr, δ = +68′)
direction diametrically opposite (α = 4hr54m, δ =
was at one stage considered by Miller as being possible. This is because the Michelson
interferometer, being a 2nd-order device, has a directional ambiguity which can only be
resolved by using the diurnal motion of the Earth. However as Miller did not include
the in-ﬂow velocity eﬀect in his analysis it is possible that a re-analysis might give this
northerly direction as the direction of absolute motion of the Solar system.

−

Hence not only did Miller observe absolute motion, as he claimed, but the quality and
quantity of his data has also enabled the conﬁrmation of the existence of the gravitational
in-ﬂow eﬀect [10, 11]. This is a manifestation of a new theory of gravity and one which
relates to quantum gravitational eﬀects via the uniﬁcation of matter and space developed
in previous sections. As well the persistent evidence that this in-ﬂow is turbulent indicates
that this theory of gravity involves self-interaction of space itself.

2.6 The Illingworth Experiment: 1927

In 1927 Illingworth [17] performed a Michelson interferometer experiment in which the
light beams passed through the gas Helium,

...as it has such a low index of refraction that variations due to temperature
changes are reduced to a negligible quantity.

For Helium at STP n = 1.000036 and so k2
He = 0.00007, which results in an enormous
reduction in sensitivity of the interferometer. Nevertheless this experiment gives an
excellent opportunity to check the n dependence in (6). Illingworth, not surprisingly,
reported no “ether drift to an accuracy of about one kilometer per second”. M´unera [19]

As shown in Fig.10 the Illingworth observations now agree with those of Michelson-
Morley and Miller, though they would certainly be inconsistent without the n

So the use by Illingworth of Helium gas has turned out have oﬀered a fortuitous
opportunity to conﬁrm the validity of the refractive index eﬀect, though because of
the insensitivity of this experiment the resulting error range is signiﬁcantly larger than
those of the other interferometer observations. So ﬁnally it is seen that the Illingworth
experiment detected absolute motion with a speed consistent with all other observations.

(5) the speed from observations of the CMB spectrum dipole term [20]. The results (1)-
(3) are not corrected for the
30km/s of the orbital motion of the Earth about the Sun
or for the gravitational in-ﬂow speed, though these correction were made for (4) with the
speeds from Table 3. The horizontal line at v = 369km/s is to aid comparisons with the
CMB frame speed data. The Miller direction is diﬀerent to the CMB direction. Due to
the angle between the velocity vector and the plane of interferometer the results (1)-(3)
are less than or equal to the true speed, while the result for (4) is the true speed as this
projection eﬀect was included in the analysis. These results demonstrate the remarkable
consistency between the three interferometer experiments. The Miller speed agrees with
the speed from the DeWitte non-interferometer experiment, in Sect.2.8. The lower data,
magniﬁed by a factor of 5, are the original speeds vM determined from fringe shifts using
(1) with k = 1. This ﬁgure updates the corresponding ﬁgure in Ref.[9].

were mounted with axes perpendicular on a rotating table, see Fig.11. Rotation of the
table through 900 produced repeatable variations in the frequency diﬀerence of about
275kHz, an eﬀect attributed to magnetorestriction in the Invar spacers due to the Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld. Observations over some six consecutive hours on January 20, 1963 from
6:00 am to 12:00 noon local time did produce a ‘dip’ in the frequency diﬀerence of some
3kHz superimposed on the 275kHz eﬀect, as shown in Fig.12 in which the local times
have been converted to sidereal times. The most noticeable feature is that the dip occurs
at approximately 17
10:00 hrs local time), which agrees with
the direction of absolute motion observed by Miller and also by DeWitte (see Sect.2.8).
It was most fortunate that this particular time period was chosen as at other times the
eﬀect is much smaller, as shown for example in Fig.9 for August or more appropriately
for the February data in Fig.7 which shows the minimum at 18:00hr sidereal time. The
local times were chosen by Jaseja et al such that if the only motion was due to the Earth’s
orbital speed the maximum frequency diﬀerence, on rotation, should have occurred at
12:00hr local time, and the minimum frequency diﬀerence at 6:00 hr local time, whereas
in fact the minimum frequency diﬀerence occurred at 9:00 hr local time.

As for the Michelson-Morley experiment the analysis of the New Bedford experiment
was also bungled. Again this apparatus can only detect the eﬀects of absolute motion if
the cancellation between the geometrical eﬀects and Fitzgerald-Lorentz length contrac-
tion eﬀects is incomplete as occurs only when the radiation travels in a gas, here the
He-Ne gas present in the maser.

This double maser apparatus is essentially equivalent to a Michelson interferometer.
Then the resonant frequency ν of each maser is proportional to the reciprocal of the

If we use the Newtonian physics analysis, as in Jaseja et al [21], which neglects both
the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction and the refractive index eﬀect, then we obtain δν =
ν0v2/c2, that is without the n2
1 term, just as for the Newtonian analysis of the
Michelson interferometer itself. Of course the very small magnitude of the absolute
motion eﬀect, which was approximately 1/1000 that expected assuming only an orbital
speed of v = 30 km/s in the Newtonian analysis, occurs simply because the refractive
index of the He-Ne gas is very close to one4. Nevertheless given that it is small the sidereal
time of the obvious ’dip’ coincides almost exactly with that of the other observations of
absolute motion.

−

The New Bedford experiment was yet another missed opportunity to have revealed
the existence of absolute motion. Again the spurious argument was that because the
Newtonian physics analysis gave the wrong prediction then Einstein relativity must be
correct. But the analysis simply failed to take account of the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contrac-
tion, which had been known since the end of the 19th century, and the refractive index
eﬀect which had an even longer history. As well the authors failed to convert their local
times to sidereal times and compare the time for the ‘dip’ with Miller’s time5.

2.8 The DeWitte Experiment: 1991

The Michelson-Morley, Illingworth, Miller and New Bedford experiments all used Michel-
son interferometers or its equivalent in gas mode, and all revealed absolute motion. The
Michelson interferometer is a 2nd-order device meaning that the time diﬀerence between
the ‘arms’ is proportional to (v/c)2. There is also a factor of n2
1 and for gases like
air and particularly Helium or Helium-Neon mixes this results in very small time dif-
ferences and so these experiments were always very diﬃcult. Of course without the gas
the Michelson interferometer is incapable of detecting absolute motion6, and so there are
fundamental limitations to the use of this interferometer in the study of absolute motion
and related eﬀects.

−

In a remarkable development in 1991 a research project within Belgacom, the Bel-
gium telecommunications company, stumbled across yet another detection of absolute
motion, and one which turned out to be 1st-order in v/c. The study was undertaken by
Roland DeWitte [22]. This organisation had two sets of atomic clocks in two buildings
in Brussels separated by 1.5 km and the research project was an investigation of the task
of synchronising these two clusters of atomic clocks. To that end 5MHz radiofrequency
signals were sent in both directions through two buried coaxial cables linking the two
clusters. The atomic clocks were caesium beam atomic clocks, and there were three in
each cluster. In that way the stability of the clocks could be established and monitored.
One cluster was in a building on Rue du Marais and the second cluster was due south in a
building on Rue de la Paille. Digital phase comparators were used to measure changes in
times between clocks within the same cluster and also in the propagation times of the RF
4It is possible to compare the refractive index of the He-Ne gas mixture in the maser with the

value extractable from this data: n2 = 1 + 302/(1000

4002), or n = 1.0000028.

signals. Time diﬀerences between clocks within the same cluster showed a linear phase
drift caused by the clocks not having exactly the same frequency together with short
term and long term noise. However the long term drift was very linear and reproducible,
and that drift could be allowed for in analysing time diﬀerences in the propagation times
between the clusters.

Changes in propagation times were observed and eventually observations over 178
days were recorded. A sample of the data, plotted against sidereal time for just three
days, is shown in Fig.13. DeWitte recognised that the data was evidence of absolute
motion but he was unaware of the Miller experiment and did not realise that the Right
Ascension for maximum/minimum propagation time agreed almost exactly with Miller’s
direction (α, δ) = (17.5h, 650). In fact DeWitte expected that the direction of absolute
motion should have been in the CMB direction, but that would have given the data
a totally diﬀerent sidereal time signature, namely the times for maximum/minimum
would have been shifted by 6 hrs. The declination of the velocity observed in this

DeWitte experiment cannot be determined from the data as only three days of data are
available. However assuming exactly the same declination as Miller the speed observed
by DeWitte appears to be also in excellent agreement with the Miller speed, which in
turn is in agreement with that from the Michelson-Morley and Illingworth experiments,
as shown in Fig.10.

and in-ﬂow eﬀects (but without turbulence). Shown are the results for four days: for the
Vernal Equinox, March 21 (shortest dashes), and for 90, 180 and 270 days later (shown
with increasing dash length). Figure (a) Shows change in one-way travel time t0nvP /c
for signal travelling from N to S. Figure (b) shows ∆t, as deﬁned in (15), with an oﬀset
such that the average is zero so as to enable comparison with the data in Fig.13. ∆t
is twice the one-way travel time. For the direction opposite to (α, δ) = (17.5h, 650) the
same curves arise except that the identiﬁcation of the months is diﬀerent and the sign
of ∆t also changes. The sign of ∆t determines which of the two directions is the actual
direction of absolute motion. However the deﬁnition of the sign convention for ∆t used
by DeWitte is unclear.

Being 1st-order in v/c the Belgacom experiment is easily analysed to suﬃcient accu-
racy by ignoring relativistic eﬀects, which are 2nd-order in v/c. Let the projection of the
absolute velocity vector v onto the direction of the coaxial cable be vP as before. Then
the phase comparators reveal the diﬀerence between the propagation times in NS and

Here L = 1.5 km is the length of the coaxial cable, n = 1.5 is the refractive index of

c/n = 200, 000km/s, and so t0 = nL/c = 7.5
when vP = 0. Then, for example, a value of vP = 400km/s would give ∆t = 30ns.
Because Brussels has a latitude of 510 N then for the Miller direction the projection
eﬀect is such that vP almost varies from zero to a maximum value of

data in Fig.13 shows ∆t plotted with a false zero, but shows a variation of some 28
ns. So the DeWitte data is in excellent agreement with the Miller’s data7. The Miller
experiment has thus been conﬁrmed by a non-interferometer experiment if we ignore a
Fresnel drag.

from gas-mode interferometer experiments, and also inconsistent with the data from the
Torr-Kolen gas-mode coaxial cable experiment, Sect.2.9. This raises the question as to
whether the Fresnel eﬀect is present in transparent solids, and indeed whether it has ever
been studied? As well we are assuming the conventional eletromagnetic theory for the
RF ﬁelds in the coaxial cable. An experiment to investigate this is underway at Flinders
university [1].

The actual days of the data in Fig.13 are not revealed in Ref.[22] so a detailed analysis
of the DeWitte data is not possible. Nevertheless theoretical predictions for various days
in a year are shown in Fig.14 using the Miller speed of vcosmic = 417 km/s (from Table
3) and where the diurnal eﬀects of the Earth’s orbital velocity and the gravitational
in-ﬂow cause the range of variation of ∆t and sidereal time of maximum eﬀect to vary
4 ns over a year compared to the
throughout the year. The predictions give ∆t = 30

giving an average slope of 3.92 minutes/day. The time diﬀerence between a sidereal day
and a solar day is 3.93 minutes/day. This demonstrates that the eﬀect is related to
sidereal time and not local solar time. The actual days of the year are not identiﬁed in

DeWitte value of 28 ns in Fig.13. If all of DeWitte’s 178 days of data were available then
a detailed analysis would be possible.

Ref.[22] does however reveal the sidereal time of the cross-over time, that is a ‘zero’
time in Fig.13, for all 178 days of data. This is plotted in Fig.15 and demonstrates
that the time variations are correlated with sidereal time and not local solar time. A
least squares best ﬁt of a linear relation to that data gives that the cross-over time
is retarded, on average, by 3.92 minutes per solar day. This is to be compared with
the fact that a sidereal day is 3.93 minutes shorter than a solar day. So the eﬀect is
certainly cosmological and not associated with any daily thermal eﬀects, which in any
case would be very small as the cable is buried. Miller had also compared his data against
sidereal time and established the same property, namely that up to small diurnal eﬀects
identiﬁable with the Earth’s orbital motion, features in the data tracked sidereal time
and not solar time; see Ref.[16] for a detailed analysis.

The DeWitte data is also capable of resolving the question of the absolute direction
of motion found by Miller. Is the direction (α, δ) = (17.5h, 650) or the opposite direction?
Being a 2nd-order Michelson interferometer experiment Miller had to rely on the Earth’s
diurnal eﬀects in order to resolve this ambiguity, but his analysis of course did not
take account of the gravitational in-ﬂow eﬀect, and so until a re-analysis of his data his
preferred choice of direction must remain to be conﬁrmed. The DeWitte experiment

27

could easily resolve this ambiguity by simply noting the sign of ∆t. Unfortunately it is
unclear in Ref.[22] as to how the sign in Fig.13 is actually deﬁned, and DeWitte does not
report a direction expecting, as he did, that the direction should have been the same as
the CMB direction.

The DeWitte observations were truly remarkable considering that initially they were
serendipitous. They demonstrated yet again that the Einstein postulates were in contra-
diction with experiment. To my knowledge no physics journal has published a report of
the DeWitte experiment.

That the DeWitte experiment is not a gas-mode Michelson interferometer experiment
is very signiﬁcant. The value of the speed of absolute motion revealed by the DeWitte
experiment of some 400 km/s is in agreement with the speeds revealed by the new
analysis of various Michelson interferometer data which uses the recently discovered
refractive index eﬀect, see Fig.10. Not only was this eﬀect conﬁrmed by comparing
results for diﬀerent gases, but the re-scaling of the older vM speeds to v = vM /√n2
1
speeds resulting from this eﬀect are now conﬁrmed. A new and much simpler 1st-order
experiment is discussed in [1] which avoids the use of atomic clocks.

2.9 The Torr-Kolen Experiment: 1981

A coaxial cable experiment similar to but before the DeWitte experiment was performed
at the Utah University in 1981 by Torr and Kolen [23]. This involved two rubidium vapor
clocks placed approximately 500m apart with a 5 MHz sinewave RF signal propagating
between the clocks via a nitrogen ﬁlled coaxial cable maintained at a constant pressure of
2 psi. This means that the Fresnel drag eﬀect is not important in this experiment. Un-
∼
fortunately the cable was orientated in an East-West direction which is not a favourable
orientation for observing absolute motion in the Miller direction, unlike the Brussels
North-South cable orientation. There is no reference to Miller’s result in the Torr and
Kolen paper, otherwise they would presumably not have used this orientation. Never-
theless there is a projection of the absolute motion velocity onto the East-West cable
and Torr and Kolen did observe an eﬀect in that, while the round speed time remained
constant within 0.0001%c, typical variations in the one-way travel time were observed,
as shown in Fig.16 by the triangle data points. The theoretical predictions for the Torr-
Kolen experiment for a cosmic speed of 417 km/s in the direction (α, δ) = (17.5h, 650),
and including orbital and in-ﬂow velocities, are shown in Fig.16. As well the maximum
eﬀect occurred, typically, at the predicted times. So the results of this experiment are
also in remarkable agreement with the Miller direction, and the speed of 417 km/s which
of course only arises after re-scaling the Miller speeds for the eﬀects of the gravitational
in-ﬂow. As well Torr and Kolen reported ﬂuctuations in both the magnitude and time
of the maximum variations in travel time just as DeWitte observed some 10 years later.
Again we argue that these ﬂuctuations are evidence of genuine turbulence in the in-ﬂow
as discussed in Sect.2.11. So the Torr-Kolen experiment again shows strong evidence for
the new theory of gravity, and which is over and above its conﬁrmation of the various
observations of absolute motion.

travelling through 500m of coaxial cable orientated in an E-W direction. Actual days
are not indicated but the experiment was done during February-June 1981. Results are
for a typical day. For the 1st of February the local time of 12:00 corresponds to 13:00
sidereal time. The predictions are for March (shortest dashes) and June, for a cosmic
speed of 417 km/s in the direction (α, δ) = (17.5h, 650), and including orbital and in-ﬂow
velocities but without theoretical turbulence.

2.10 Galactic In-ﬂow and the CMB Frame

±

−

Absolute motion (AM) of the Solar system has been observed in the direction (α =
17.5h, δ = 650), up to an overall sign to be sorted out, with a speed of 417
40 km/s.
This is the velocity after removing the contribution of the Earth’s orbital speed and the
Sun in-ﬂow eﬀect. It is signiﬁcant that this velocity is diﬀerent to that associated with the
Cosmic Microwave Background 8 (CMB) relative to which the Solar system has a speed
7.220), see [20]. This CMB velocity
of 369 km/s in the direction (α = 11.20h, δ =
is obtained by ﬁnding the preferred frame in which this thermalised 30K radiation is
isotropic, that is by removing the dipole component. The CMB velocity is a measure
of the motion of the Solar system relative to the universe as a whole, or aleast a shell
of the universe some 15Gyrs away, and indeed the near uniformity of that radiation in
all directions demonstrates that we may meaningfully refer to the spatial structure of
the universe. The concept here is that at the time of decoupling of this radiation from
matter that matter was on the whole, apart from small observable ﬂuctuations, at rest
with respect to the quantum-foam system that is space. So the CMB velocity is the
motion of the Solar system with respect to space universally, but not necessarily with
respect to the local space. Contributions to this velocity would arise from the orbital
motion of the Solar system within the Milky Way galaxy, which has a speed of some 250
km/s, and contributions from the motion of the Milky Way within the local cluster, and
so on to perhaps larger clusters.

On the other hand the AM velocity is a vector sum of this universal CMB velocity
and the net velocity associated with the local gravitational in-ﬂows into the Milky Way
and the local cluster. If the CMB velocity had been identical to the AM velocity then the
in-ﬂow interpretation of gravity would have been proven wrong. We therefore have three
pieces of experimental evidence for this interpretation (i) the refractive index anomaly
discussed previously in connection with the Miller data, (ii) the turbulence seen in all
detections of absolute motion, and now (iii) that the AM velocity is diﬀerent in both
magnitude and direction from that of the CMB velocity, and that this velocity does not
display the turbulence seen in the AM velocity.

That the AM and CMB velocities are diﬀerent amounts to the discovery of the
resolution to the ‘dark matter’ conjecture. Rather than the galactic velocity anomalies
being caused by such undiscovered ‘dark matter’ we see that the in-ﬂow into non spherical
galaxies, such as the spiral Milky Way, will be non Newtonian [1]. As well it will be
interesting to determine, at least theoretically, the scale of turbulence expected in galactic
systems, particularly as the magnitude of the turbulence seen in the AM velocity is
somewhat larger than might be expected from the Sun in-ﬂow alone. Any theory for the
8The understanding of the galactic in-ﬂow eﬀect was not immediate: In [9] the direction was
not determined, though the speed was found to be comparable to the CMB determined speed.
In [10] that the directions were very diﬀerent was noted but not appreciated, and in fact thought
to be due to experimental error. In [11] an analysis of some of the ‘smoother’ Michelson-Morley
data resulted in an incorrect direction. At that stage it was not understood that the data showed
large ﬂuctuations in the azimuth apparently caused by the turbulence. Here the issue is hopefully
ﬁnally resolved.

30

turbulence eﬀect will certainly be checkable within the Solar system as the time scale of
this is suitable for detailed observation.

It is also clear that the time of obervers at rest with respect to the CMB frame is
absolute or universal time. This interpretation of the CMB frame has of course always
been rejected by supporters of the SR/GR formalism. As for space we note that it has a
diﬀerential structure, in that diﬀerent regions are in relative motion. This is caused by
the gravitational in-ﬂow eﬀect locally, and as well by the growth of the universe.

Figure 17: Speed ﬂuctuations determined from Fig.13 by subtracting a least squares
best ﬁt of the forms shown in Fig.14b. A 1ns variation in travel time corresponds
approximately to a speed variation of 27km/s. The larger speed ﬂuctuations actually
arise from a ﬂuctuation in the cross-over time, that is, a ﬂuctuation in the direction of
the velocity. This plot implies that the velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld is turbulent. The scale of this
turbulence is comparable to that evident in the Miller data, as shown in Fig.7 and Fig.9.

The velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld equation [1] is expected to have solutions possessing turbu-
lence, that is, random ﬂuctuations in both the magnitude and direction of the gravita-
tional in-ﬂow component of the velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld. Indeed all the Michelson interferom-
eter experiments showed evidence of such turbulence. The ﬁrst clear evidence was from
the Miller experiment, as shown in Fig.7 and Fig.9. Miller oﬀered no explanation for
these ﬂuctuations but in his analysis of that data he did running time averages, as shown
by the smoother curves in Fig.7. Miller may have in fact have simply interpreted these
ﬂuctuations as purely instrumental eﬀects. While some of these ﬂuctuations may be
partially caused by weather related temperature and pressure variations, the bulk of the
ﬂuctuations appear to be larger than expected from that cause alone. Even the original

31

Michelson-Morley data in Fig.5 shows variations in the velocity ﬁeld and supports this
interpretation. However it is signiﬁcant that the non-interferometer DeWitte data also
shows evidence of turbulence in both the magnitude and direction of the velocity ﬂow
ﬁeld, as shown in Fig.17. Just as the DeWitte data agrees with the Miller data for speeds
and directions the magnitude ﬂuctuations, shown in Fig.17, are very similar in absolute
magnitude to, for example, the speed turbulence shown in Fig.9.

It therefore becomes clear that there is strong evidence for these ﬂuctuations being
evidence of physical turbulence in the ﬂow ﬁeld. The magnitude of this turbulence ap-
pears to be somewhat larger than that which would be caused by the in-ﬂow of quantum
foam towards the Sun, and indeed following on from Sect.2.10 some of this turbulence
may be associated with galactic in-ﬂow into the Milky Way. This in-ﬂow turbulence is
a form of gravitational wave and the ability of gas-mode Michelson interferometers to
detect absolute motion means that experimental evidence of such a wave phenomena has
been available for a considerable period of time, but suppressed along with the detection
of absolute motion itself. Of course ﬂow equations do not exhibit those gravitational
waves of the form that have been predicted to exist based on the Einstein equations, and
which are supposed to propagate at the speed of light. All this means that gravitational
wave phenomena is very easy to detect and amounts to new physics that can be studied
in much detail, particularly using the new 1st-order interferometer discussed in [1].

2.12 Vacuum Michelson Interferometers

Over the years vacuum-mode Michelson interferometer experiments have become in-
creasing popular, although the motivation for such experiments appears to be increas-
ingly unclear. The ﬁrst vacuum interferometer experiment was by Joos [24] in 1930 and
gave vM < 1km/s. This result is consistent with a null eﬀect as predicted by both the
quantum-foam physics and the Einstein physics. Only Newtonian physics is disproved by
such experiments. These vacuum interferometer experiments do give null results, with
increasing conﬁdence level, as for example in Refs.[25, 26, 27, 28], but they only check
that the Lorentz contraction eﬀect completely cancels the geometrical path-length eﬀect
in vacuum experiments, and this is common to both theories. So they are unable to
distinguish the new physics from the Einstein physics. Nevertheless recent works [27, 28]
continue to claim that the experiment had been motivated by the desire to look for ev-
idence of absolute motion, despite eﬀects of absolute motion having been discovered as
long ago as 1887. The ‘null results’ are always reported as proof of the Einstein for-
malism. Of course all the vacuum experiments can do is check the Lorentz contraction
eﬀect, and this in itself is valuable. Unfortunately the analysis of the data from such
experiments is always by means of the Robertson [29] and Mansouri and Sexl formalism
[30], which purports to be a generalisation of the Lorentz transformation if there is a pre-
ferred frame. However in [1] we have already noted that absolute motion eﬀects, that is
the existence of a preferred frame, are consistent with the usual Lorentz transformation,
based as it is on the restricted Einstein measurement protocol. A preferred frame is re-
vealed by gas-mode Michelson interferometer experiments, and then the refractive index
of the gas plays a critical role in interpreting the data. The Robertson and Mansouri-

32

Sexl formalism contains no contextual aspects such as a refractive index eﬀect and is
thus totally inappropriate to the analysis of so called ‘preferred frame’ experiments.

It is a curious feature of the history of Michelson interferometer experiments that
it went unnoticed that the results fell into two distinct classes, namely vacuum and
gas-mode, with recurring non-null results from gas-mode interferometers.

2.13

Solid-State Michelson Interferometers

−

≈

−

The gas-mode Michelson interferometer has its sensitivity to absolute motion eﬀects
greatly reduced by the refractive index eﬀect, namely the k2 = n2
1 factor in (1), and
for gases with n only slightly greater than one this factor has caused much confusion
over the last 115 years. So it would be expected that passing the light beams through
a transparent solid with n
1.5 rather than through a gas would greatly increase the
sensitivity. Such an Michelson interferometer experiment was performed by Shamir and
Fox [31] in Haifa in 1969. This interferometer used light from a He-Ne laser and used
perspex rods with L = 0.26m. The experiment was interpreted in terms of the supposed
1/n2. The light passing
Fresnel drag eﬀect, which has a drag coeﬃcient given by b = 1
through the solid was supposed to be ‘dragged’ along in the direction of motion of the
solid with a velocity ∆V = bv additional to the usual c/n speed. As well the Michel-
son geometrical path diﬀerence and the Lorentz contraction eﬀects were incorporated
into the analysis. The outcome was that no fringe shifts were seen on rotation of the
interferometer, and Shamir and Fox concluded that this negative result “enhances the
experimental basis of special relativity”.

The Shamir-Fox experiment was unknown to us9 at Flinders university when in 2002
several meters of optical ﬁbre were used in a Michelson interferometer experiment which
also used a He-Ne laser light source. Again because of the n2
1 factor, and even
ignoring the Fresnel drag eﬀect, one would have expected large fringe shifts on rotation
of the interferometer, but none were observed. As well in a repeat of the experiment
single-mode optical ﬁbres were also used and again with no rotation eﬀect seen. So
this experiment is consistent with the Shamir-Fox experiment. Re-doing the analysis by
including the supposed Fresnel drag eﬀect, as Shamir and Fox did, makes no material
diﬀerence to the expected outcome. In combination with the non-null results from the
gas-mode interferometer experiments along with the non-interferometer experiment of
DeWitte it is clear that transparent solids behave diﬀerently to a gas when undergoing
absolute motion through the quantum foam. Indeed this in itself is a discovery of a new
phenomena.

−

The most likely explanation is that the physical Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect
has a anisotropic eﬀect on the refractive index of the transparent solid, and this is such as
to cause a cancellation of any diﬀerences in travel time between the two arms on rotation
of the interferometer. In this sense a transparent solid medium shares this outcome with
the vacuum itself.

9This experiment was performed by Professor Warren Lawrance, an experimental physical

chemist with considerable laser experience.

2.14 Absolute Motion and Quantum Gravity

Absolute rotational motion had been recognised as a meaningful and obervable phenom-
ena from the very beginning of physics. Newton had used his rotating bucket experiment
to illustrate the reality of absolute rotational motion, and later Foucault and Sagnac pro-
vided further experimental proof. But for absolute linear motion the history would turm
out to be completely diﬀerent. It was generally thought that absolute linear motion was
undetectable, at least until Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory appeared to require it. In
perhaps the most bizarre sequence of events in modern science it turns out that absolute
linear motion has been apparent within experimental data for over 100 years.
It was
missed in the ﬁrst experiment designed to detect it and from then on for a variety of
sociological reasons it became a concept rejected by physicists and banned from their
journals despite continuing new experimental evidence. Those who pursued the scientiﬁc
evidence were treated with scorn and ridicule. Even worse was the impasse that this
obstruction of the scientiﬁc process resulted in, namely the halting of nearly all progress
in furthering our understanding of the phenomena of gravity. For it is clear from all
the experiments that were capable of detecting absolute motion that there is present in
that data evidence of turbulence within the velocity ﬁeld. Both the in-ﬂow itself and the
turbulence are manifestations at a classical level of what is essentially quantum gravity
processes.

Process Physics has given a uniﬁcation of explanation and description of physical
phenomena based upon the limitations of formal syntactical systems which had never-
theless achieved a remarkable encapsulation of many phenomena, albeit in a disjointed
and confused manner, and with a dysfunctional ontology attached for good measure. As
argued in early sections space is a quantum system continually classicalised by on-going
non-local collapse processes. The emergent phenomena is foundational to existence and
experientialism. Gravity in this system is caused by diﬀerences in the rate of processing
of the cellular information within the network which we experience as space, and conse-
quentially there is a diﬀerential ﬂow of information which can be aﬀected by the presence
of matter or even by space itself. Of course the motion of matter including photons with
respect to that spatial information content is detectable because it aﬀects the geometrical
and chronological attributes of that matter, and the experimental evidence for this has
been exhaustively discussed in this section. What has become very clear is that the phe-
nomena of gravity is only understandable once we have this uniﬁcation of the quantum
phenomena of matter and the quantum phenomena of space itself. In Process Physics the
diﬀerence between matter and space is subtle. It comes down to the diﬀerence between
informational patterns that are topologically preserved and those information patterns
that are not. One outcome of this uniﬁcation is that as a consequence of having a quan-
tum phenomena of space itself we obtain an informational explanation for gravity, and
which at a suitable level has an emergent quantum description. In this sense we have an
emergent quantum theory of gravity. Of course no such quantum description of gravity
is derivable from quantising Einsteinian gravity itself. This follows on two counts, one
is that the Einstein gravity formalism fails on several levels, as discussed previously, and
second that quantisation has no validity as a means of uncovering deeper physics. Most

surprising of all is that having uncovered the logical necessity for gravitational phenom-
ena it also appears that even the seemingly well-founded Newtonian account of gravity
has major failings. The denial of this possibility has resulted in an unproductive search
for dark matter. Indeed like dark matter and spacetime much of present day physics has
all the hallmarks of another episode of Ptolemy’s epicycles, namely concepts that appear
to be well founded but in the end turn out to be illusions, and ones that have acquired
the status of dogma.

If the Michelson-Morley experiment had been properly analysed and the phenomena
revealed by the data exposed, and this would have required in 1887 that Newtonian
physics be altered, then as well as the subsequent path of physics being very diﬀerent,
physicists would almost certainly have discovered both the gravitational in-ﬂow eﬀect
and associated turbulence.

It is clear then that observation and measurement of absolute motion leads directly to
a changed paradigm regarding the nature and manifestations of gravitational phenomena,
and that the new 1st-order interferometer described in [1] will provide an extremely
simple device to uncover aspects of gravity previously denied by current physics. There
are two aspects of such an experimental program. One is the characterisation of the
turbulence and its linking to the new non-linear term in the velocity ﬁeld theory. This is
a top down program. The second aspect is a bottom-up approach where the form of the
velocity ﬁeld theory, or its modiﬁcation, is derived from the deeper informational process
physics. This is essentially the quantum gravity route. The turbulence is of course
essentially a gravitational wave phenomena and networks of 1st-order interferometers
will permit spatial and time series analysis. There are a number of other gravitational
anomalies which may also now be studied using such an interferometer network, and so
much new physics can be expected to be uncovered.

3 Conclusions

We have shown here that six experiments so far have clearly revealed experimental evi-
dence of absolute motion. As well these are all consistent with respect to the direction
and speed of that motion. This clearly refutes the fundamental postulates of the Einstein
reinterpretation of the relativitsic eﬀects that had been developed by Lorentz and others.
Indeed these experiments are consistent with the Lorentzian relativity in which reality
displays both absolute motion eﬀects and relativistic eﬀects. As discussed in detail in [1]
it is absolute motion that actually causes these relativistic eﬀects. As well these absolute
motion experiments have given experimental support for a new theory of gravity. These
developments are discussed more extensively in [1].

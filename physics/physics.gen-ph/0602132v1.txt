Abstract

Recent observations of ultra high energy cosmic rays and gamma
rays suggest that there are small violations of Lorentz symmetry. If
there were no such violations, then the GZK cut oﬀ would hold and
cosmic rays with energy ∼ 1020eV or higher would not be reaching
the earth. However some such events seem to have been observed.
This has lead to phenomenological models in which there is a small
violation of the Lorentz symmetry or the velocity of light. However re-
cent Quantum Gravity and String Theory approaches which no longer
consider a diﬀerentiable spacetime manifold already predict such vio-
lations. Similarly there are other theoretical reasons which also point
to this. We brieﬂy discuss the various possibilities.

1 The Fuzzy Spacetime Approach

In a recent communication Pavlopoulos [1] has suggested that we may al-
ready be observing a violation of Lorentz symmetry due to the observed
time lags of cosmic gamma rays of diﬀerent energies.
In fact it has been
suspected that this could indeed be the case from an observation of ultra
high energy cosmic rays. In this case, given Lorentz symmetry there is the
GZK cut oﬀ such that particles above an energy of 1020eV would not be able
to travel cosmological distances and reach the earth (Cf. ref.[2, 3] for de-
tails). However, it is suspected that some twenty contra events have already

1

been detected, and phenomenological models of Lorentz symmetry violation
have been constructed by Glashow, Coleman and others [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
The essential point here is that the energy momentum relativistic formula is
modiﬁed leading to a dispersive eﬀect.
We would like to point out that apart from observation based models such
a result follows from a fundamental point of view in modern approaches in
which the diﬀerentiable Minkowski spacetime is replaced by one which is
fuzzy or noncommutative owing to a fundamental minimum length l being
introduced. This is the case in Quantum Super String Theory and Quan-
tum Gravity approaches (Cf.ref.[2]). Based on these considerations, we can
deduce from theory that the usual energy momentum formula is replaced by
(c = 1 = ¯h)

E2 = m2 + p2 + αl2p4

where α is a dimensionless constant of order unity. This leads to a mod-
iﬁcation of the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations at ultra high energies
(Cf.ref.[2, 3, 10]). With this, it has been shown by the author that in the
scattering of radiation, instead of the usual Compton formula we have

k =

mk0 + α l2

2 [Q2 + 2mQ]2

[m + k0(1 − cosΘ)]

where we use natural units c = ¯h = 1, m is the mass of the elementary par-
ticle causing the scattering, ~k, ~k0 are the initial and ﬁnal momentum vectors
respectively and Q = k0 − k, and Θ is the angle between the incident and
scattered rays. Equation (2) shows that k = k0 + ǫ, where ǫ is a positive
quantity less than or equal to ∼ l2, l being the fundamental length. It must
be remembered that in these units k represents the frequency. The above
can be written in more conventional form as

hν = hν0[1 + 0(l2)]

Equation (3) eﬀectively means that due to the Lorentz symmetry violation
in (1), the frequency is increased or, the speed of propagation of a given
frequency is increased. As noted such models in a purely phenomenological
context have been considered by Glashow, Coleman, Carroll and others. In
any case what this means in an observational context is that higher frequency
gamma rays should reach us earlier than lower frequency ones in the same
burst. As Pavlopoulos reports (Cf.ref.[1]) this indeed seems to be the case.

Subject to further tests and conﬁrmation, for example by NASA’s GLAST
satellite to be launched shortly [11], spacetime at a micro or ultra high energy
level is not a smooth manifold, brought out by this manifestation in for
example (1).

2 Massive Photons

Recently the author deduced from theory that the photon has a small mass
of ∼ 10−65gms, this being consistent with the velocity of light and also with
experimental limits on the photon mass as will be discussed below [12, 13].
Interestingly from purely thermodynamic reasoning Landsberg had shown
that the above mass is the minimum allowable mass in the universe [14].
More recently from a completely unrelated point of view, it was shown by
the author that this is the minimum allowable mass in the universe in a model
where zero point oscillators at the Planck scale provide the underpinning for
the universe [15, 2].
The derivation of the photon mass uses the fact that for the Langevin equa-
tion in the limiting case of low viscous resistance, a particle behaves like
a Newtonian particle moving in the absence of any external forces with a
uniform velocity given by

If in the above relation we use extreme values of the minimum thermody-
namic temperature of the universe and the minimum mass, we recover the
velocity of light. To be more speciﬁc we use the Beckenstein temperature
given by

with M ∼ 1055gms, the known mass of the universe. This gives us the value

For the minimum mass we use a result due to Landsberg (Cf.ref.[14]), and
also the same result independently obtainable as noted above from a model
of Planck oscillators, viz.,

hv2i =

kT
m

T =

¯hc3
8πkMG

T ∼ 10−28K.

m ∼ 10−65gms

It ust be stressed that though the above equation for the average velocity
square resembles the root mean square temperature equation of thermody-
namics, it is in fact diﬀerent. Moreover, this velocity would be maintained
for the age of the universe and would be Lorentz invariant [16] (Cf.ref.[12]
for details).
Let us brieﬂy consider some of the consequences of the photon mass and also
look for experimental veriﬁcation, apart from consistency with theory.
It may be remarked that the mass for the photon has been proposed in
the past, though from phenomenological considerations [16, 17]. Indeed it
is remarkable that exactly the above mass was indicated from experimental
observation (Cf.ref.[18] and references there in), and has been attributed to
a vacuum induced dissipative mechanism.
With a non zero photon mass we would have, for radiation

E = hν = mγc2[1 − v2

γ/c2]−1/2

From (4) one would have a dispersive group velocity for waves of frequency
ν given by (Cf. also ref.[18])

We would like to point out that (5) indicates that higher frequency radiation
has a velocity greater than lower frequency radiation. This is a very subtle
and minute eﬀect and is best tested in for example, the observation of high
energy gamma rays, which we receive from deep outer space.
It is quite
remarkable that as pointed out, we may already have witnessed this eﬀect-
higher frequency components of gamma rays in cosmic rays do indeed seem
to reach earlier than their lower frequency counterparts [1]. The GLAST
satellite of NASA to be launched in 2006/2007 may be able to throw more
light on these high energy Gamma rays.
This apart, a ﬁnite photon mass would imply a slight modiﬁcation of the
Coulomb interaction, which would go over into a Yukawwa type potential,
this given by, (in natural units ¯h = 1 = c.)

V (r) = e−µr/r

(6)

where µ is the mass in these units. As can be seen from (6), the potential V
has a ﬁnite range. However this range is ∼ 1
µ which is ∼ 1028cms, as can be

4

easily calculated. This range is in fact the radius of the universe! Neverthe-
less this cut oﬀ does imply that there will not be any infra red divergences
[19].
The range of the Yukawa type Coulomb potential being of the order of the
radius of the universe, we would expect that the modiﬁcation would be minis-
cule. Nevertheless from a strictly mathematical point of view, the photon
mass converts the otherwise long range Coulomb potential into a short range
Yukawa potential with the consequence that several otherwise strictly diver-
gent integrals become convergent. It then becomes possible to use techniques
suitable for short range potentials (Cf. for example [20, 21]). The rather labo-
rious modiﬁcations required for handling the Coulomb potential in scattering
theory (Cf. for example [22, 23]) can be eased. For instance there is an inter-
esting recurrence relation for the large l phase shifts of the Yukawa potential
[24] viz.,

δl+1/δl ≈ 1 − (µ/K)

valid for a large range of energies K. This relation can now be used, though
as µ is very small, it shows that the convergence of the phase shifts with
respect to l is extremely slow.
Another result of the non zero mass of the photon is that in addition to the
two traverse polarizations of light, there will be a longitudinal component
also (Cf. for example ref.[25]). It must be remembered that all these eﬀects
are small and consistent with the size of the universe. Nevertheless there are
experimental tests, in addition to those mentioned above, which are doable.
It is well known that for a massive vector ﬁeld interacting with a magnetic
dipole of moment M, for example the earth itself, we would have with the
usual notation (Cf.ref.[19])

(cid:21)
Considerations like this have yielded in the past an upper limit for the photon
mass, for instance 10−48gms and 10−57gms. Nevertheless (7) can be used for
a precise determination of the photon mass. It may be mentioned here that
contrary to popular belief, there is no experimental evidence to indicate that
the photon mass is zero! (Cf. discussion in ref.[16]).
Finally, it is interesting to observe that the above value for the photon mass

was also obtained by Terazawa [26], using the Dirac Large Number Hypothe-
sis, something which is in fact a consequence of the Planck oscillator approach
alluded to (Cf.ref.[2]).

3 The Finsler Spacetime Approach

In this approach not only the violation of GZK cut oﬀ in ultra high energy
cosmic rays but also the anisotropy as indicated by data from COBE is
taken into account. Then we have a Finsler metric [27, 28, 29], which in two
dimensions can be written as

x′ = erα L(x), tan ¯hα =

u
c

(8)

r being the anisotropy factor and L stands for the usual Lorentz transforma-
tion, which is not evident in (8) because there is only one space dimension.
From observation it appears that

r ≥ 10−10

Finally the Finslerian metric in three dimensions is given by

ds2 =

(dx0 − dx1)2
(dx0)2 − (dx1)2 − (dx2)2 − (dx3)2

"

r

#

·

(dx0)2 − (dx1)2 − (dx2)2 − (dx3)2
h

i

(9)
It can be seen from (9) that there is a prefered direction like the x1 axis in
this special choice. The metric in (9) leads to a modiﬁed energy momentum
formula which is given by

−r

(E/c − ~p · ~ν)2
E2/c2 − p2

"

#

(E2/c2 − p2) = m2c2(1 − r)1−r(1 + r)1+r(ν2 = 1)

(10)

In (10) the anisotropy direction is given by ~ν. As r is small, (10) simpliﬁes
to a form similar to (1), with suitable approximations.

4 Discussion

We would like to point out that a Lorentz symmetry violation would also
imply a violation of the CPT invariance, though this could be expected only

6

Indeed the modiﬁed
from high energies, the eﬀect itself being small [30].
Dirac equation (Cf.ref.[3, 10]) throws up a Lagrangian with a parity violating
term. Speciﬁcally, this term in the Dirac Hamiltonian is

γ5lp2,

which is clearly CPT violating.
It must also be remarked that given a fuzzy spacetime or equivalently a
noncommutative geometry, we can deduce the photon mass. It has already
been pointed out that such noncommutativity of coordinates leads to a term
in gauge theory which is similar to the symmetry breaking Higgs ﬁeld term
[2]. It is this term which in the case of U(1) electromagnetic ﬁeld gives ∼ l2.
This is ∼ 10−66gms, which as argued is the photon mass.

We speculate that the universe may be ﬁlled with a continuum which may be called aether. Based
on a spherical source and sink model of electric charges, we derive the Coulomb’s law of interactions
between static electric charges in vacuum by methods of hydrodynamics. A reduced form of the
Lorentz’s force law of static electric charges is derived based on a deﬁnition of electric ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

The Coulomb’s law of interactions between static elec-

tric charges in vacuum can be written as

F21 =

1
4πǫ0

q1q2
r2 ˆr21,

(1)

where q1 and q2 are the electric quantities of two elec-
tric charges, r is the distance between the two electric
charges, ǫ0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum, F21 is the
force exerted on the electric charge with electric quantity
q2 by the electric charge with electric quantity q1, ˆr21
denotes the unit vector directed outward along the line
from the electric charge with electric quantity q1 to the
electric charge with electric quantity q2.

The main purpose of this paper is to derive the
Coulomb’s law of interactions between static electric
charges in vacuum by means of ﬂuid mechanics based
on spherical source and spherical sink model of particles.
The motive of this paper is to seek a mechanism of
the Coulomb’s law. The reasons why new mechanical
interpretations of the Coulomb’s law are interesting may
be summarized as follows.

Firstly, the Coulomb’s law is an elementary and pro-
found law in physics and play various roles in the ﬁelds
of electromagnetism, electrodynamics, quantum mechan-
ics, cosmology and thermodynamics, etc., for instance,
see [1, 2] and the references cited there. From the point
view of reductionism, the fundamental importance of the
Coulomb’s law in all branches of physics urges the reduc-
tionists to provide it a proper mechanical interpretation.
Secondly, the mechanism of this action-at-a-distance
Coulomb’s law remains an unsolved problem in physics
for more than 200 years after the law was put forth by
Coulomb in 1785 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. From the point view of
reductionism, we need a satisfactory mechanical interpre-
tation in the framework of Descartes’ scientiﬁc research
program.

Thirdly, although the Maxwell’s theory of electro-
magnetic phenomena is a ﬁeld theory [6], the concept
of ﬁeld is diﬀerent from that of continuum mechanics

[7, 8, 8, 9, 10] because of the absence of a continuum.
Thus, the Maxwell’s theory can only be regarded as a
phenomenological theory. New mechanical interpreta-
tions of the Coulomb’s law may help us to establish a
ﬁeld theory of electromagnetic phenomena [6, 11].

Fourthly, there exists some inconsistencies and inner
diﬃculties in the conventional classical electrodynamics
[8, 12, 13, 14]. New theories of the Coulomb’s law may
help to resolve such diﬃculties.

Finally, one of the tasks of physics is the uniﬁcation of
the four fundamental interactions in the universe. New
theories of interactions between static electric charges
may shed some light on this puzzle.

To conclude, it seems that new considerations on the
Coulomb’s law is needed. It is worthy keeping an open
mind with respect to all the theories of interactions be-
tween static electric charges before the above problems
been solved.

Now let us brieﬂy review the long history of mechanical

interpretations of electromagnetic phenomena.

Descartes was the ﬁrst to bring the aether concept into
science by suggesting that it has mechanical properties
according to E. T. Whittaker[4]. He believed that every
physical phenomenon could be interpreted in the con-
struction of a mechanical model of the universe.

William Watson and Benjamin Franklin introduced the
one-ﬂuid theory of electricity independently in 1746 [4].
Henry Cavendish attempted to explain some of the prin-
cipal phenomena of electricity by means of an elastic ﬂuid
in 1771[4]. Not contented with the above mentioned one-
ﬂuid theory of electricity, du Fay, Robert Symmer and
C. A. Coulomb developed a two-ﬂuid theory of electricity
from 1733 to 1789 [4]. John Bernoulli introduced a ﬂuid
aether theory of light in 1752[4]. Euler believed that all
electrical phenomena is caused by the same aether that
propagates light.

In 1821, in order to explain polarisation of light, A. J.
Frensnel proposed an aether model which is able to trans-
mit transverse waves. Inspired by Frensnel’s luminifer-
ous aether theory, numerous dynamical theories of elastic
solid aether were established by Stokes, Cauchy, Green,

1

MacCullagh, Boussinesq, Riemann and William Thom-
son [4].

In 1861,

in order to obtain a mechanical interpre-
tation of electromagnetic phenomena, Maxwell estab-
lished a mechanical model of a magneto-electric medium.
Maxwell’s magneto-electric medium is a cellular aether,
looks like a honeycomb. In a remarkable paper published
in 1864, Maxwell established a group of equations which
were named after his name later.

In a remarkable paper published in 1905, Einstein
abandoned the concept of aether[15]. However, Ein-
stein’s assertion did not cease the exploration of aether,
for instance, see [4, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Ein-
stein changed his attitude later and introduced his new
concept of ether[23, 24]. I regret to admit that it is im-
possible for me to mention all the works related to this
ﬁeld in history.

Inspired by the above mentioned works, we show that
the Coulomb’s law of interactions between static electric
charges can be derived based on a continuum mechanics
model of vacuum and a spherical source and sink model
of electric charges.

DEFINITIONS OF SPHERICAL SOURCES AND
SPHERICAL SINKS IN FLUIDS

The purpose of this section is to establish a deﬁnition

of spherical sources and spherical sinks in ﬂuids.

If there exists a velocity ﬁeld which is continuous and
ﬁnite at all points of the space, with the exception of
individual isolated points, then these isolated points are
called singularities usually. Point spherical sources and
spherical sinks are examples of singularities.

To avoid singularities, we may introduce a mechanical
model of spherical sources and spherical sinks with ﬁnite
radii in ﬂuids.

Deﬁnition 1 Suppose there exists a hard sphere with a
ﬁnite radius a at point P0 = (x0, y0, z0). If the velocity
ﬁeld near the hard sphere at point P = (x, y, z) is

p

(2)

u(x, y, z, t) =

Q
4πr2 ˆr,
(x − x0)2 + (y − y0)2 + (z − z0)2, r ≥ a, is
where r =
the distance between the point P0 and the point P , ˆr de-
notes the unit vector directed outward along the line from
the point P0 to the point P , then we call this hard sphere
a spherical source if Q > 0 or a spherical sink if Q < 0.
Q is called the strength of the spherical source or the
spherical sink.

For convenience, we may regard a spherical sink as a

negative spherical source.

A calculation shows that the strength Q of a spherical
source or spherical sink evaluates the volume of the ﬂuid
leaving or entering the spherical source or the spherical
sink per unit time.

FORCES ACTING ON SPHERICAL SOURCES
AND SPHERICAL SINKS IN IDEAL FLUIDS

The purpose of this section is to calculate the forces
between spherical sources and spherical sinks in inviscid
incompressible ﬂuids which is called ideal ﬂuids usually.
Suppose the velocity ﬁeld u of an ideal ﬂuid is irrota-

tional, then we have [9, 25, 26, 27, 28]

u = ∇φ,

(3)

where φ is the velocity potential, ∇ = i ∂
the Hamilton operator.

∂x + j ∂

∂y + k ∂

∂z is

It is known that the equation of mass conservation of
an ideal ﬂuid becomes Laplace’s equation [9, 25, 26, 27,
28]

∇2φ = 0,

(4)

where φ is velocity potential, ∇2 = ∂
the Laplace operator.

Using spherical coordinates(r, θ, ϕ), a general form of
solution of Laplace’s equation Eq.(4) can be obtained by
sepatation of variables as[28]

φ(r, θ) =

endre’s function of the ﬁrst kind which is deﬁned as

Pl(x) =

dxl (x2 − 1)l.

(6)

From Eq.(2) and Eq.(5), we see that the velocity po-
tential φ(r, θ) of a spherical source or spherical sink is a
solution of Laplace’s equation (4).

Theorem 2 Suppose (1)there exists an ideal ﬂuid (2)the
ideal ﬂuid is irrotational and barotropic, (3)the density
ρ is homogeneous, that is ∂ρ
∂t = 0
(4)there are no external body forces exerted on the ﬂuid,
(5)the ﬂuid is unbounded and the velocity of the ﬂuid at
the inﬁnity is approaching to zero. Suppose a spherical
source or spherical sink is stationary and is immersed in
the ideal ﬂuid. Then, there is a force

exerted on the spherical source or spherical sink by the
ﬂuid, where ρ is the density of the ﬂuid, Q is the strength
of the spherical source or the spherical sink, a is the ra-
dius of the spherical source or the spherical sink, u0 is the
velocity of the ﬂuid at the location of the spherical source
induced by all means other than the spherical source it-
self.

Proof. Only the proof of the case of a spherical source
is needed. Let us select the coordinates that is attached
to the static ﬂuid at the inﬁnity.

We set the origin of the coordinates at the center of the
spherical source. Let S1 denotes the spherical surface of
the spherical source. We surround the spherical source by
an arbitrary spherical surface S2 with radius R centered
at the center of the spherical source. The outward unit
normal to the spherical surface S1 and S2 is denoted by
n. Let τ (t) denotes the mass system of ﬂuid enclosed in
the volume between the surface S1 and the surface S2 at
time t. Let FQ denotes the hydrodynamic force exerted
on the spherical source by the mass system τ , then a
reaction of this force must act on the the ﬂuid enclosed
in the mass system τ . Let F2 denotes the hydrodynamic
force exerted on the mass system τ due to the pressure
distribution on the surface S2. Let F1 = −FQ denotes
the force acted on the mass system τ by the spherical
source through the surface S1. Let K denotes momentum
of the mass system τ .

As an application of Newton’s second law of motion to

the mass system τ ,we have

DK
Dt

= F1 + F2 = −FQ + F2,

(8)

where D/Dt represents the material derivative in the la-
grangian system.

In order to calculate FQ, let us calculate DK/Dt and
F2 respectively. The expressions of the momentum K
and the force F2 are

where f (t) is an arbitrary function of time t. Since the
velocity u of the ﬂuid at the inﬁnity is approaching to
zero, and noticing (5), φ(t) must be of the following form

where the ﬁrst integral is volume integral, the second
integral is surface integral, n denotes the unit vector di-
rected outward along the line from the origin of the co-
ordinates to the ﬁeld point(x, y, z).

Since the velocity ﬁeld is irrotational, we have the fol-

lowing relation

where ϕ(x) = O(ψ(x)), x → a stands for limx→a | ϕ(x) |

Applying (17) at the inﬁnity and using (19), we have
| u |→ 0, ∂φ/∂t → 0 and p = p∞, where p∞ is a constant.
Thus, f (t) = p∞/ρ. Therefore, according to (17), we
have

we may let R to be large enough. Now, making use of

Thus, Eq.(26) becomes

(28)

Now let us calculate the two terms in Eq.(28) respec-
tively. Firstly, let us calculate the integral I1 in Eq.(27).
Since the velocity ﬁeld induced by the spherical source
Q is (2), then according to the superposition principle of
velocity ﬁeld of ideal ﬂuids, the velocity u on the surface
S1 is

Since the velocity ﬁeld u is irrotational, we have

We speculate that the radius a of the spherical source

Thus, Eq.(36) becomes

I2 = J1 + J2 + J3 + J4.

(38)

Noticing that the radius a of the spherical source may
be so small that the velocity u0 at any point of the spher-
ical surface S1 may be treated as a constant, the four

Therefore, using Eq.(39-42), we have

Putting Eq.(35) and Eq.(43) into Eq.(28), we arrive at

Eq.(7). This completes the proof. (cid:3)

Theorem 2 only considers the situation that the spheri-
cal sources or spherical sinks are at rest in ﬂuids. Now let
us consider the case that the spherical sources or spheri-
cal sinks are moving in ﬂuid.

Theorem 3 Suppose the presuppositions (1),(2),(3),(4)
and (5)in Theorem 2 are valid and a spherical source or
a spherical sink is moving in the ﬂuid with a velocity vs,
then there is a force

ﬂuid at the location of the source induced by all means
other than the spherical source itself.

Proof. The velocity of the ﬂuid relative to the spher-
ical source at the location of the spherical source is
uf − vs. Let us select the coordinates that is attached to
the spherical source and set the origin of the coordinates
at the center of the spherical source. Then Eq.(44) can
be obtained following the same procedures in the proof
of Theorem 2. (cid:3)

Applying Theorem 3 to the situation that a spherical
source or spherical sink is exposed to the velocity ﬁeld of
another source or sink, we have

Corollary 4 Suppose the presuppositions (1),(2),(3),(4)
and (5) in Theorem 2 are valid and a spherical source or
spherical sink with strength Q2 is exposed to the velocity

strength Q1, then the force F21 exerted on the spherical
source or spherical sink with strength Q2 by the velocity

A SPHERICAL SOURCE AND SPHERICAL SINK
MODEL OF ELECTRIC CHARGES

The purpose of this section is to establish a spherical

source and spherical sink model of electric charges.

It is an old idea that the universe may be ﬁlled with a
kind of continuously distributed material which may be
called aether [4].

In order to compare ﬂuid motion with electric ﬁelds,
Maxwell
introduced an analogy between sources or
sinks and electric charges [4]. Recently, we derive the
Maxwell’s equations in vacuum by methods of contin-
uum mechanics based on a continuum mechanical model
of vacuum and a point source and sink model of electric
charges [29].

In 1892[30], Lorentz established an electromagnetic
theory in order to derive the Fresnel convection coeﬃ-
cient. There are only two types of entities in Lorentz’s
theory: movable electrons and a stagnant aether. To
avoid singularities, the electrons were not designed to be
singularities as Larmor’s electrons in the aether ﬁeld, but
were extremely small hard spheres with a ﬁnite radius.

Inspired by Maxwell [4] and Lorentz[30], we speculate
that electric charges may not be singularities, but may be
extremely small hard spherical sources or spherical sinks
with ﬁnite radii.

In [29], we introduced a hypothesis that the constitu-

tive relation of the aether satisﬁes
deij
dt

2η

sij +

1
2G

=

dsij
dt

,

where sij is the stress deviator, eij is the strain deviator,
G is the shear modulus, η is the dynamic viscocity.

Now let us introduce the following deﬁnition of

(47)

(48)

Maxwelllian relaxation time τ

τ =

5

(49)

is

Therefore, using Eq.(48), Eq.(47) becomes

sij
τ

+

dsij

= 2G

deij

.

Let T0 be the characteristic time of a observer of an
electric charge. We may suppose that the observer’s time
scale T0 is very large compares to the the Maxwelllian re-
laxation time τ . So the Maxwelllian relaxation time τ is
a relatively a small number and the stress deviator sij
changes very slowly. Thus, the second term in the left of
Eq.(49) may be neglected. Therefore, the observer con-
cludes that the aether behaves like the Newtonian-ﬂuid.
According to this observer, the constitutive relation of
the aether may be written as

where u is the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid, p is the pressure
ﬁeld, ρ is the density ﬁeld, ζ and η are two dynamic
viscocity coeﬃcients, t is time.

The deﬁnition of Reynolds number Re of a ﬂuid ﬁeld

Re =

ρ0U0L0
η0

,

(53)

where ρ0 is the characteristic density, U0 is the charac-
teristic velocity, L0 is the characteristic length, η0 is the
characteristic dynamic viscocity coeﬃcient.

Hypothesis 6 We speculate that the characteristic ve-
locity U0 of an electric charge is so high compares to
the characteristic dynamic viscocity coeﬃcient η0 of the
aether that the Reynolds number Re of the ﬂuid ﬁeld is
a large number.

(50)

sij = 2η

deij
dt

.

We see that Eq.(50) is the constitutive relation of a
Newtonian-ﬂuid. Therefore, the observer concludes that
the aether behaves as a Newtonian-ﬂuid under his time
scale.

Now let us introduce the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 5 Suppose all the electric charges in the
universe are small hard spherical sources or spherical
sinks with ﬁnite radii in the aether. We deﬁne a spher-
ical source as a negative electric charge. We deﬁne a
spherical sink as a positive electric charge. The elec-
tric charge quantity of an electric charge is deﬁned as
qe = −kQρQ, where ρ is the density of the aether, kQ is
a positive dimensionless constant, Q is called the strength
of the spherical source or spherical sink.

A calculation shows that the mass m of a electric

charge is changing with time as

where qe is the electric charge quantity of the electric
charge.

We may introduce a hypothesis that the masses of elec-
tric charges are changing so slowly relative to the time
scaler of human beings that they can be treated as con-
stants approximately.

DERIVATION OF THE COULOMB’S LAW OF
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STATIC ELECTRIC
CHARGES IN VACUUM

The purpose of this section is to derive the Coulomb’s
law of interactions between static electric charges in vac-
uum.

It is known that the motion of an incompressible
Newtonian-ﬂuid is governed by the Navier–Stokes equa-
tions [8]

∂u
∂t

ρ

(cid:20)

+ (u · ∇)u

= −∇p − η∇2u,

(52)

(cid:21)

Under this hypothesis, we may treat the aether as an
inviscid incompressible ﬂuid when we study the motion
of electric charges. Therefore, according to Hypothesis 6,
the motion of the aether is governed by the Euler equa-
tions [8]

∂u
∂t

ρ

+ (u · ∇)u = −

∇p.

(54)

Now based on Hypothesis 5 and Hypothesis 6, we can
make use of Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 to study the mo-
tions of electric charges.

Theorem 7 Suppose a static electric charge with an
electric charge quantity q2 is exposed to the electric ﬁeld
of another static electric charge with an electric charge
quantity q1, then the force F21 exerted on the electric
charge with electric charge quantity q2 by the electric ﬁeld
of the electric charge with electric charge quantity q1 is

where ˆr21 denotes the unit vector directed outward along
the line from the electric charge with electric charge quan-
tity q1 to the electric charge with electric charge quantity
q2, a1 is the radius of the electric charge with electric
charge quantity q1, r is the distance between the two elec-
tric charges, kQ and kE are two positive dimensionless
constants.

Proof. From Hypothesis 5, we have

Q1 = −

where Q1 and Q2 are the strengthes of the electric charges
respectively. From a deﬁnition in Eq.(65) in [29], we have

(57)

where ǫ0 is the dielectric constant of vacuum. Putting
Eq.(56) and Eq.(57) into Eq.(46), we get Eq.(55). (cid:3)

If we the second term in Eq.(55) vanishes, then we get

Proof. From Hypothesis 5, we have

Compare Eq.(58) with Eq.(1), it is natural to introduce

the following hypothesis

Hypothesis 8 Suppose we have the following relation

(58)

(59)

kEkQ =

3

.

Now based on Hypothesis 8, from Eq.(58) we see that
we have arrived at the Coulomb’s law (1) of interactions
between static electric charges in vacuum.

Theorem 7 only states the force exerted on a static
electric charge by the electric ﬁeld of another static elec-
tric charge. We may generalize this result to the case of
an static electric charge exposed to any electric ﬁeld of
the aether.

In [29], we have introduce the following deﬁnition

E = −kE

∂u
∂t

,

(60)

where u is the displacement of the visco-elastic aether,
∂u
is the velocity ﬁeld of the aether, E is the electric
∂t
ﬁeld intensity, kE is a positive dimensionless constant.

Since the observer of an electric charge concludes that
the aether behaves as a Newtonian-ﬂuid under his time
scale, we may deﬁne the electric ﬁeld intensity as the
velocity ﬁeld of the aether. Therefore, we may introduce
a deﬁnition as

Deﬁnition 9 We deﬁne the electric ﬁeld intensity in the
aether as

E = −kEva,

(61)

where va is the velocity ﬁeld of the aether at the location
of an testing electric charge induced by all means other
than the testing electric charge itself, E is the electric
ﬁeld intensity, kE is a positive dimensionless constant.

Theorem 10 Suppose a static electric charge with an
electric charge quantity q is exposed to an electric ﬁeld
E of the aether, then the force F exerted on the electric
charge with electric charge quantity q2 by the electric ﬁeld
E is

F = qE −

4πa3ǫ0
3kQ

∂E
∂t

,

(62)

where q is the electric charge quantity of the electric
charge, a is the radius of the electric charge, ǫ0 is the
dielectric constant of vacuum, kQ is a positive dimen-
sionless constant, E is the electric ﬁeld at the location of
the electric charge induced by all means other than the
electric charge itself.

where Q is the strength of the electric charge. Putting
Eq.(61) and Eq.(63) into Eq.(7) and make use of Eq.(57)
and Eq.(59), we get Eq.(62). (cid:3)

If we the second term in Eq.(62) vanishes, then we get

F = qE.

(64)

We know that the Lorentz’s force law of electric charges

can be written as

F = qE + qve × B,

(65)

where F is the force exerted on the electric charge, q is the
electric charge quantity of the electric charge, ve is the
velocity of the electric charge, E and B are the electric
ﬁeld intensity and the magnetic induction respectively at
the location of the electric charge induced by all means
other than the electric charge itself.

We see that Eq.(64) is a reduced form of the Lorentz’s

force law (65) of static electric charges in vacuum.

SUPERPOSITION PRINCIPLE OF ELECTRIC
FIELD OF STATIC ELECTRIC CHARGES

From the deﬁnition 9, we see that the electric ﬁeld
intensity is nothing but the velocity ﬁeld of the aether.
Therefore, the superposition principle of electric ﬁelds
of static electric charges in vacuum is nothing but the
superposition theorem of the velocity ﬁeld of ﬂuids.

CONCLUSION

We show that the forces between spherical sources and
spherical sinks in ideal ﬂuids coincide with the Coulomb’s
inverse-square-law of interactions between static electric
charges. It is an old idea to speculate that the universe
may be ﬁlled with a kind of continuously distributed ma-
terial which may be called aether. Based on a contin-
uum mechanical model of vacuum and a spherical source
and spherical sink model of electric charges, we derive
the Coulomb’s law of interactions between static electric
charges in vacuum. Furthermore, we deﬁne the electric
ﬁeld intensity as the velocity ﬁeld of the aether at the lo-
cation of an testing electric charge induced by all means
other than the testing electric charge itself. Thus, we
obtain a reduced form of the Lorentz’s force law of static
electric charges in vacuum.

DISCUSSION

There exists some interesting theoretical, experimen-
tal and applied problems in the ﬁelds of ﬂuid mechanics,
continuum mechanics, classical electrodynamics, quan-
tum electrodynamics and other related ﬁelds involving
this theory of the Coulomb’s law of interactions between
static electric charges. It is an interesting task to gener-
alize this work further to describe the forces exerted on
a electric charge moving with a velocity in a electromag-
netic ﬁeld.

APPENDIX: A FORMULAE IN FLUID
MECHANICS

Suppose the velocity ﬁeld u of an ideal ﬂuid is irrota-

tional. Then we have the following relation

u = ∇φ,

(A.66)

where φ is the velocity potential.

Let τ (t) denotes the mass system of ﬂuid enclosed in
the volume enclosed by the spherical surface S without
any bodies or singularities inside S at time t. According
to Reynolds’ transport theorem [9, 26, 28], we have

where V is the volume ﬁxed in space which coincide with
the mass system τ (t) at time t, that is V = τ (t).

According to Ostrogradsky–Gauss theorem [9, 26, 28],

we have

Do Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields Have Rest Masses in the Fractal

Universe?

As well known rest masses of elementary particles and physical ﬁelds appear when temperature of
Universe become low enough and symmetry broke. Are there another sources of rest masses that
are consequences of other nature of rest masses or it is the only methods for generating rest masses?
What will be with massless ﬁelds when the laws of symmetry are not exact laws but only are very
good approximation and the time is not homogeneous, as it is in the fractal world? In this paper
based on the fractal theory of time and space (developed by author earlier) a possible source of rest
masses caused by the fractional dimensions (FD) of the time is considered. It gives rest masses (very
small) for all particles and ﬁelds including gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds. The estimation

of the values of the rest masses gives mg = pε(tti)−1, mf = p(t0ti)−1 where ti is the necessary

time for photons and gravitons with rest masses mph and mg to get the velocity equal the speed of
light (in the fractal Universe the moving with any velocities is possible), t0 is the time of existence
of Universe. Under some assumption preliminary values of rest masses photons and gravitons are
obtained: for a rest mass of photons mf ∼ 10−39

g, for a rest mass of gravitons mg ∼ 10−43

g.

I. INTRODUCTION

The problems of existence rest masses of electromag-
netic, gravitational and neutrino ﬁelds are open till
now. From one side the experiments can not discover
rest masses of these ﬁelds, from other side there is un-
explained question why some physical ﬁelds have rest
masses, the other ﬁelds not have it.In early years it was
wide-spread the opinion that the ﬁelds of the interac-
tions (electromagnetic, gravitational an so on) between
particles are massless and must not take a charges, but
example of the electro-weak interactions by means of vec-
tor mesons broke this opinion and interactions of quarks
broke the opinions about chargeless of interactions ﬁelds.
Thus the situation is: there are the physical ﬁelds with
rest masses and there are the physical ﬁelds without rest
masses; there are the interactions ﬁelds with charges and
without charges. There are the theorems (Goldstone and
analogies) about massless boson ﬁelds as consequence of
symmetry laws. In the space with the fractal time (see
[1]- [15] not all the symmetry laws are fulﬁlled and these
theorems work only as a good approach. Only in the
case when the fractal dimension of time almost integer
the symmetry laws are almost fulﬁll, not exactly, but as a
good approach. So the existence in the fractal world rest
masses of bosons ﬁeld such as electromagnetic and grav-
itational) do not contradicts any theorems true for world
with exact symmetry laws and homogeneous time. In this
paper shown that in the space with fractal time (dimen-
sions of time dt = 1+ε(r, t) 6= 1) in the frame-work of the
fractal theory of time and space [1]- [15] all physical ﬁelds
have rest masses originated by fractional additives ε to

integer time dimension. For the ﬁelds with rest masses in
the integer dimensions time these additional masses are
non-essential, but it gives the main masses for the mass-
less early ﬁelds such as electromagnetic and gravitational
ﬁelds. So the symmetry for all physical ﬁelds in respect
to rest masses is restored: in fractal Universe all physical
ﬁelds have rest masses: some ﬁelds have rest masses orig-
inated when temperature of Universe become low enough
and symmetry laws is broken, other ﬁelds got rest masses
by means of fractional dimensions of time (or space) from
the time of beginning of the ”big bang”, when the time
and space with fractal dimensions were originated.

II. HOW TO DESCRIBE THE FUNCTIONS

WITH DEPENDENCIES AT TIME AND

COORDINATES IN THE FRACTAL WORLD?

As the ﬁrst step of describing the physical functions in
the fractal Universe (the world with fractional dimensions
of time and space) it is necessary to introduce the deﬁni-
tions of fractal time and fractal space (for the purpose of
this paper it is enough to introduce only the fractal time)
and mathematical methods its describing. Following [1],
[2], we will consider both time and space as the initial
real material ﬁelds existing in the world and generating
all other physical ﬁelds. Therefore, we introduce the in-
tegral functionals (both left-sided and right-sided) which
are suitable to describe the dynamics of functions deﬁned
on multifractal sets of time and space (generalized frac-
tional derivatives (GFD), see [1]- [2], [3]) and replace by
GFD the usual derivatives and integral respect to time

1

and space coordinates in the fractional dimensions func-
tional. These functionals GFD are simple and natural
generalization of the Riemann-Liouville fractional deriva-
tives and integrals:

Dd

+,tf (t) = (cid:18) d

dt(cid:19)nZ t

a

f (t′)dt′

Γ(n − d(t′))(t − t′)d(t′)−n+1 (1)

Dd

−,tf (t) = (−1)n(cid:18) d

dt(cid:19)nZ b

t

f (t′)dt′

Γ(n − d(t′))(t′ − t)d(t′)−n+1

(2)

where Γ(x) is Euler’s gamma function, and a and b are
some constants from [0, ∞). In these deﬁnitions, as usu-
ally, n = {d} + 1 ,where {d} is the integer part of d if
d ≥ 0 (i.e. n − 1 ≤ d < n) and n = 0 for d < 0.
If
d = const, the generalized fractional derivatives (GFD)
(1)-(2) coincide with the Riemann - Liouville fractional
derivatives (d ≥ 0) or fractional integrals (d < 0). When
d = n + ε(t), ε(t) → 0, GFD can be represented by means
of integer derivatives and integrals.We pay attention that
there are relations between GFD and ordinary derivatives
for dα near integer values. If dα → n where n is an in-
teger number, for example dα = 1 + ε(r
(t), t), α = r
, t,

in that case it is possible represent GFD by approximate

For n = 1, that is, d = 1 + ε, |ε| << 1 it is possible to
obtain:

(4)

where a is constant and deﬁned by the choice of the rules
of regularization of integrals (1)-(2) (for more detailed
see [1], [2], [3]). The selection of the rule of regularization
that gives a real additives for usual derivative in (3) yield
a = 0.5 for d < 1 [1]. The functions under integral sign in
(1)-(2) we consider as the generalized functions deﬁned
on the set of the ﬁnite functions [17]. The notions of
GFD, similar to (1)-(2), can also be deﬁned and for the
space variables r. In the deﬁnitions of GFD (1)-(2) the
connections between fractal dimensions of time dt(r(t), t)
and main characteristics of physical ﬁelds (say, potentials
Φi(r(t), t), i = 1, 2, ..) or densities of Lagrangians Li) are
determined. Following [1], we deﬁne this connection by
the relation

dt(r(t), t) = 1 +Xi

βiLi(Φi(r(t), t))

(5)

sake of independence from regularization constant). The
deﬁnition of time as the system of subsets and deﬁnition
the FD d (see 4) connects the value of fractional (fractal)
dimension dt(r(t), t) with each time instant t. The latter
depends both on time t and coordinates r. If dt = 1 (an
absence of physical ﬁelds) the set of time has topological
dimension equal to unity.
Thus, in the fractal Universe for changes of any physical
functions describing it is necessary to use the GFD in-
stead of ordinary derivatives and integrals. Only in the
case when corrections to integer dimensions is small (it is
the wide-spread case in our world) it is possible replace
the GFD by ordinary derivatives using the relations (3).
We stress now that GFD Ddt
+,t take into account the inﬂu-
ences of the past of the phenomena on the present time
state of the phenomena. The GFD Ddt
−,t take into ac-
count the inﬂuences of future times on the present time
state of the phenomena. So the mathematical methods
of GFD deﬁned on the multifractal sets allow to take into
account the inﬂuences of past and future on the state of
system at the present time. In the fractal world describ-
ing by GFD there are no stable phenomena because the
diﬀerentiation by means of GFD of constant value do not
gives zero.

III. THE FRACTAL UNIVERSE IS IN

CONTINUAL CHANGING AND EXPANDING

The hypotheses of the ”big bang ” as the originate of
our Universe gives continual changing and expanding of
time and space, but the mathematical methods of or-
dinary diﬀerential and integral calculus based on usual
mathematical analysis do not give possibility to describe
this changing correctly. In particular, thou the time and
space are continually expanding (in the frame of GR,)
from point of view of ordinary analysis in this expanding
world exist constant physical values (for example a vol-
ume, an energy and so on). The fractal Universe is an
open system (about open systems see [19], [20]) deﬁned
on the measure carrier (see [15], [1]- [15]). It is expanding,
so all physical values in our world must not be constant.
Thou its the changing is very small it has a principle role.
The GFD gives such changing of all physical phenomena
and values. That changes originate by fractional dimen-
sions of time ( and the space) and allow to describe the
changing concerned with Universe expanding. Let us see
now how to calculate the GRD (1) with respect to t at
constant value a0 = const. In the fractal world there are
no constant values because GFD of constant values do
not equal zero

where Li are densities of energy of physical ﬁelds, βi are
dimensional constants with physical dimension of [Li]−1
i = a−1βi for the
(it is worth to choose β ′

i in the form β ′

for large t. So if our world has the fractal dimensions any
values in this world including the constant values of our
world may be expanded in inﬁnite power series in t. The

(7)

In (7) the B -is the upper limit of integral in GFD. The
time t in (1) - (2) is the time of existence of Universe. It
is useful for symmetry of (6) and (7) to choose B equal
2t . In that case (though it has no principle sense) the
inﬂuence of future on present time is bounded by the time
equal the time of existence of Universe.

IV. HOW THE FRACTAL DIMENSIONS OF

TIME ORIGINATE REST MASSES IN THE

MASSLESS FIELD THEORIES ?

b) gravitational ﬁelds equations (the measure carrier is
Minkowski time- space)

The corrections given by GFD in case of using it for
diﬀerentiation of constant value were considered early .
Let us now represent (7) in the form when its main char-
acteristics conserves but the derivatives are the ordinary.
Thus an any constant value a0 in fractal world may be
represented as the value with dependence of time t ( or
coordinates r)

a ≈ a0 exp

ε
tε

(8)

In (8) the factor exp(εt−ε) describes the corrections given
by the fractal dimensions of time. The ordinary diﬀer-
entiation of (8) with respect to t coincide with result of
GFD of a with respect to t. If dt = 1 the time dependence
in (8) disappears (ε = 0 ). The (8) may be used for cal-
culation of the ordinary derivatives in the theory of the
fractal time on base of relation (4) if dt = 1 + ε(r, t) and
|ε| << 1. In the fractal time and space the equations of
all physical ﬁelds must be wrote by means of GFD. For
case when FD of time has small fractal corrections to
unit these equations may be wrote by means of ordinary
derivatives but using (4). Than in the equations with
GFD appear the members proportional to ﬁelds that usu-
ally describe the rest masses. These members are result
of existence of fractal dimensions of time in fractal Uni-
verse where the time treats as the real ﬁeld and the ﬁeld
of time originate all physical ﬁelds ( see [1] - [4]) includ-
ing the rest masses of massless ﬁelds. As the examples
of originating the rest masses by GFD the demonstration
of appealing rest masses for electromagnetic and gravita-
tional ﬁelds will be considered in next paragraph .

In (10) and (11)) α1, α2 are Dirac type matrices, I is

a0 = ε(r(t), t) = ag + ae + an =

(12)

where Lg, Le, Ln are Lagrangians density of energies for
gravitational, electro-weak and strong ﬁelds, βi is the full
energies of the ﬁelds that constructed the Li .

We consider now the cases of free electromagnetic and
gravitational ﬁelds and neglect by inﬂuences of the
ﬁelds with imaginary energies (this inﬂuences gives non-
essentials corrections see [15]) and omit the members
with m2 and b2 ( which were formal introduced for ful-
ﬁllment of the conditions of existence the GFD ). Thus

of these ﬁelds. If neglect by the members describing the
interactions with the ﬁelds with an imaginary masses and
replace the functions Aµ and Φµν by the plane waves with

(19)

Thus it was shown that the massless ﬁelds got the rest
masses and these masses deﬁned by the fractal dimen-
sions of the time. If the fractal corrections to the fractal
dimensions of time are equal zero the rest masses are also
equal zero. The value of rest masses depends of the FD of
time (d = 1 + ε(r(t), t)). So the rest masses are functions
of time and coordinates included by means of the densi-
ties of energies βiLi(r(t), t)) and diﬀers for diﬀerent time
and in diﬀerent coordinates. This value and its deriva-
tives with respect to t gives the rest masses for case when
its velocity is equal zero. In fractal theory of time and
space a masses may have any velocities. Now we must
take into account this possibility and use the relation for
moving particles (see [4]) in modiﬁed SR for multifractal
time

E = β ∗−1E0 =

E0

4q(1 − v2

c2 )2 + 4a2

(20)

where a2 = ( ∂ε
∂t )2t2. Thus for the rest masses originated
by the fractal dimensions of time for the case when its
velocity v equal speed of light v = c obtain

and for large t (t is the time of existence of Universe) ∂ε
∂t
also may be treated as constant value. In this case

∂2ε

and for the rest mass of gravitons mg we obtain

mg ≈ r ε

(23)

(24)

For ε ∼ r0
r where r0 and r are the gravitational radius of
Earth and its radius, t ∼ 1016sec and ti ∼ 10−34sec (ti is
the time needs for graviton to receive the velocity of light)
is the time of ”Big Bang” origin, we obtain mg ∼ 10−43g.
If diﬀerentiate ∂ε
∂t with respect to t then for estimation
of mg we receive

mg ≈ r 1

tti

¯hc−2

(25)

and mg ∼ 10−39g.

b) The rest masses of photons

We may use the same assumptions for estimation the rest
masses of photons that have been used for the estimation
of the rest masses of gravitons. So we receive the same
formula. The estimation of ti will be the same that for
gravitons (mph ∼ 10−39g). The another selection of ti
as the time of emitting of quanta of light ti ∼ 10−12sec.
gives mph ∼ 10−50g. We pay attention, as ε is in general
not constant value, on not necessity the using of 6 or 8
for calculation the derivatives of ε with respect to t if is
known the dependence of ε at t.

VI. THE PROBLEMS OF HIDDEN MASSES OR

BLACK MATTER IN THE FRACTAL UNIVERSE

(21)

The considered theory do not deﬁne the values of pa-
rameters t and ti included in relations (24)-(25), so any
estimations of the values of rest masses of gravitons and
photons are preliminary and depends of hypothesis lay-
ing in the methods of selection t and ti. Nevertheless, as
example, consider the order of the rest masses of gravi-
tons and photons (neutrinos also have the rest masses
originated by FD of time, but it seems that the main
part of the rest masses of neutrinos may be explained by
ordinary theories).

a) gravitons masses

Let a0 = ε and ε with grate accuracy may be treated
as constant value. Than

4

As well known, the theories of galaxies moving needs
for the value of mass of Universe the value almost in nine
times large than the masses observed by astronomers. So,
where is the deﬁcit of matter hidden? Is it the masses of
interstellar gas substance pressed by gravitational ﬁelds,
or is it the black matter of unknown nature? These ques-
tions do not have now unambiguously answer. The exis-
tence of the rest masses of photons and gravitons allows
to include these masses in the possible scenario of the
models of hidden and black matter. Really, if the masses
of photons and gravitons have the value of order 10−39g
it is quite enough for explaining the necessary deﬁcit of
masses in the Universe.

VII. CAN THE BOSE-CONDENSATES OF

PHOTONS OR GRAVITONS EXIST IN THE

FRACTAL UNIVERSE?

Is it possible to imagine the ﬂow of photons or gravi-
tons with very small wave numbers and very low temper-
ature that satisfy the conditions that are necessary for
Bose-condensation? It seems ( if its moving take place
in the very strong gravitational or electromagnetic ﬁelds
that makes its velocities ( and kinetic energy) very small)
because of existence of the rest masses such condensation
is not contradicts the physical laws. The really answer
now is unknown.

VIII. CONCLUSION

The main results obtained in this paper are:

1. All physical ﬁelds have rest masses originated by the
fractal dimensions of time;
2. The rest masses originated by the FD of time have
similar characteristics ( in our approach ) for any mass-
less ﬁelds ;
3. The rude estimation of values of rest masses gives
satisfactory values for explaining the problem of black
matter and hidden masses;
4. The really existence of the rest masses of photons and
gravitons makes unnecessary aspiration of the formal in-
troduced masses in theories [18], [1]- [15] to zero ;
5. Some questions arise: have rest masses of photons
and gravitons unknown charges?; can a charge photons
(or a gravitons) interact with each other? What may be
answers on these questions and may the theory of open
systems [19]- [20] (quantum variants) give these answers?
6. The fractal theory of time and space restore the sym-
metry respect rest masses for all physical ﬁelds

Abstract

The new ‘quantum-foam in-ﬂow’ theory of gravity has explained numerous so-
called gravitational anomalies, particularly the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, which is now seen
to be a dynamical eﬀect of space itself, and whose strength is determined by the ﬁne
structure constant, and not by Newton’s gravitational constant G. Here we show an
experimentally signiﬁcant approximate dynamical eﬀect, namely a vector superposi-
tion eﬀect which arises when we have absolute motion and gravitational in-ﬂows: the
velocities for these processes are shown to be approximately vectorially additive. The
violations of this superposition eﬀect are, under normal conditions, extremely small,
and they are the vorticity eﬀects that the Gravity Probe B gyroscope experiment will
soon begin observing. As previously reported General Relativity predicts a smaller
vorticity eﬀect (therein called the ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect) than the new theory of grav-
ity. The extreme conditions for signiﬁcant exceptions to this superposition eﬀect are
also explained.

A new theory of gravity has recently been proposed [1, 2], with an earlier version given
in [3, 4], that diﬀers signiﬁcantly in its eﬀects from both the Newtonian theory of gravity
and from General Relativity, but which agrees with these theories in those very restricted
cases where they have been successfully tested, and as well gives a completely diﬀerent
In the Newtonian theory gravity is explained as a consequence of the gravi-
ontology.
tational acceleration ﬁeld, while in General Relativity the explanation is in terms of the
metric of a curved ‘spacetime’ manifold construct. In contrast, in the new theory, gravity
is a consequence of a restructuring of a substratum of space; at its deepest level space is
non-geometrical and is best described as a processing ‘quantum foam’. Matter eﬀectively
dissipates this quantum-foam, and so this substratum essentially ‘ﬂows’ towards matter.
In the new theory the inhomogeneities and time-dependencies of this ‘ﬂow’ manifest as
the phenomenon we know as gravity. This is a non-metric theory of gravity, and except
in the special case of the external Schwarzschild metric in General Relativity (GR) the
predictions of GR and the new theory are diﬀerent. This special case arose in the so-called
‘tests’ of General Relativity, such as the precession of the perihelion of planetary elliptical
orbits, the gravitational bending of light by the sun, and the gravitational redshift eﬀect.
In Process Physics [1, 5] space is essentially an ‘information-theoretic’ system, and is a
totally diﬀerent category of existence from time, which is modelled as a ‘process’, and not
as a geometrical entity. Because of this the new ‘process physics’ predicted that absolute
motion should have been observed [5]. Absolute motion is motion relative to space itself. A
subsequent review of the experimental data showed that indeed absolute motion had been
observed at least seven times, including even the original Michelson-Morley experiment
of 1887. It was only in 2002 [6] that it was discovered how the Michelson interferometer
actually operated; only in the presence of a gas in the light path can this device detect
absolute motion1, and fortunately several interferometer experiments were done in air
1In vacuum the geometrical path diﬀerence eﬀect that Michelson had originally considered is cancelled

while two others were done in helium gas. This is explained in detail in [7], but it needs
to be emphasised that the operation of the Michelson interferometer requires that the
so-called ‘special relativistic’ length contraction eﬀect be taken into account. But even
then the fringe shift eﬀect is suppressed by the very small factor n2 − 1, compared to the
Newtonian physics theory for the interferometer that Michelson had used in the analysis of
the indeed small but not ‘null’ fringe shifts of the 1887 experiment; here n is the refractive
index of the gas. The recent 2002 theory for the Michelson interferometer enabled a
detailed re-analysis of data from ﬁve such experiments, and the extracted velocity of
absolute motion was found to be completely consistent, and also consistent with absolute
motion experiments done using co-axial cables [7], giving the velocity of some 417±40km/s
in the direction (Right Ascension = 5.2hr, Declination= −670) 2.

The Miller interferometer experiment [8] of 1925/1926 was so comprehensive in its
data that not only was the orbital motion of the earth about the sun detected, and used
by Miller to calibrate the interferometer3, but now in conjunction with the new theory of
gravity, which aﬀects Miller’s calibration protocol and so leading to a re-analysis of his
data, it was discovered that experimental evidence of the gravitational ‘in-ﬂow’ past the
earth towards the sun was present in the data [7].

The new theory of gravity involves two constants, one being Newton’s gravitational
constant G, which now is seen to essentially determine the rate at which matter ‘dissi-
pates’ the quantum foam, and a second new dimensionless ‘gravitational constant’, which
determines the self-interaction of the quantum foam; this is a signiﬁcant dynamical eﬀect
absent in both the Newtonian theory and General Relativity. Analysis of the Greenland
bore hole g anomaly data [2, 9] revealed the numerical value of this constant to be the ﬁne
structure constant, α ≈ 1/137, to within experimental error. Then the new self-interaction
dynamics was shown to explain the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, which has remained a
deep mystery in physics since its discovery in the relative motion of galaxies and in spiral
galaxy rotations.

In brief summary we now note some of the successes of this new theory of gravity: (i) a
dynamical explanation for the equivalence principle, and experimental evidence in support
of the Lorentzian explanation for relativistic eﬀects, namely that length contractions, time

exactly by the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect upon the arms of the interferometer, which is of course
how this eﬀect was proposed. However in the presence of a gas this cancellation is incomplete, and some
of the early interferometer experiments were done in air or helium, so permitting the dependence on n to
be recently conﬁrmed using this older gas-mode interferometer data [6, 7]. So modern vacuum resonator
interferometers are incapable of detecting absolute motion. However putting gas into the resonators does
enable them to detect absolute motion. One such experiment is about to be performed.

2This is diﬀerent from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anistropy determined velocity which
is, for the solar system, 369 km/s in the direction (RA = 11.20h, Dec = −7.220). These velocities are
diﬀerent because they relate to diﬀerent eﬀects; the absolute velocity vector refers to absolute motion wrt
local space, and is associated with the rotation of the Milky Way, the Milky Way gravitational inﬂow, and
also with the motion of the Milky Way within the local cluster etc, whereas the CMB velocity is wrt the
average ‘universal’ spatial structure, at least that spatial section presently ‘visible’.
3And so avoiding the use of the incorrect ‘Newtonian theory’ used by Michelson.

3

dilations, mass increases, etc are real physical eﬀects caused by absolute motion of, say,
rods and clocks, and that both the Galilean and Lorentz transformations describe reality,
but must be applied to diﬀerent representations of the data, and that after proper analysis
of the data we discover that the speed of light c is only the speed with respect to the local
quantum-foam system. As well Process Physics appears to oﬀer an explanation for the
so-called ‘dark energy’ eﬀect [1], (ii) an explanation of the bore hole g anomaly data, (iii)
a new theory of black holes in which their properties are determined by the ﬁne structure
constant, and not by G; these black holes are manifestly diﬀerent from the black holes of
General Relativity, and are not formed by collapsing matter as in General Relativity, (iv)
an explanation for the mass of the black holes discovered at the centre of several globular
clusters, including a detailed predicted eﬀective mass for these which is in agreement
with the observational data, (v) an explanation for the orbital velocity anomaly or ‘dark
matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies, but absent in elliptical galaxies, (vi) an explanation for
the formation of spiral galaxies based on primordial black holes, (vii) a conﬁrmation of
gravitational waves predicted by the new theory and now apparent in data from various
detections of absolute motion. These gravitational waves are essentially turbulence in
the quantum-foam ‘ﬂow’, and are very diﬀerent in characteristics and speed from those
predicted by General Relativity, but so far undetected. Indeed one strong prediction of the
above analyses is that both the Newtonian theory of gravity and General Relativity are
falsiﬁed. In particular this implies that the General Relativity gravitational waves do not
physically exist, (viii) the prediction of novel eﬀects in Cavendish laboratory experiments
designed to measure G. Indeed anomalies in the existing data are already indicating the
existence of spatial self-interaction eﬀects, and these experiments are predicted to be able
to determine the value of α, so here is a ﬁrm prediction that a Cavendish experiment can
easily check4, (ix) the prediction that the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment [10, 11]
will detect precessions of the onboard gyroscopes much larger than predicted by General
Relativity, and arising from the eﬀects of the large velocity of absolute motion of the earth
upon both the so-called ‘frame-dragging’ and geodetic precession components. In the new
theory the ‘frame-dragging’ is simply a result of vorticity eﬀects caused by, in the main, this
absolute motion, with both rotational and translational motion now playing a role. As well
the prediction is made that the GP-B experiment will also be capable of detecting the new
gravitational wave phenomenon [12], (x) predictions that the new gravity theory requires
a re-analysis of stellar dynamics, which may have a bearing on the solar neutrino problem,
(xi) the demonstration that the new theory of gravity gives a comprehensive explanation
for the success of the Global Positioning System (GPS) [13] that is totally diﬀerent, at
an ontological level, from that of General Relativity, and that this new explanation may
enable, through the observation of subtle eﬀects, the GPS constellation to be used to
detect the new gravitational wave phenomena, and also to improve the GPS in being used
4Even a review of diﬀerent past Cavendish experiments, taking into account the new theory of gravity in
Sect.2, should reveal the α-dependent dynamics, and at the same time remove the longstanding systematic
discrepencies that are evident in the data.

to establish the global time standard, and ﬁnally (xii) an explanation for various other not
well-known gravitational anomalies such as the Allais, Saxl and Allen, Zhou, and Shnoll
eﬀects and other observed eﬀects.

All of the above analyses and observed eﬀects imply that gravity is a much more com-
plex phenomena than is contained in either the Newtonian or General Relativity theory. It
is also becoming clear why the deep failure of these two theories has escaped detection for
so long, over and above the long standing scandalous ban in physics on reporting on-going
experimental evidence of absolute motion and other anomalies. In the case of the Newto-
nian theory it turns out that the solar system was too special to have revealed the presence
of the ‘dark-matter’ eﬀect, and then when General Relativity was being constructed by
Hilbert and Einstein, it was forced to agree with the ﬂawed Newtonian theory in the low
speed limit. As well in the case of General Relativity all but one of the so-called tests
of this theory used the external Schwarzschild metric, and it went unnoticed that this is
completely equivalent to Newton’s inverse square law. So in these cases it was still the
Newtonian theory that was being tested, together with novel eﬀects associated with the
geodesic equation. It was not until the in-ﬂow formalism was recently developed that it
was realised that the so-called ‘new gravity dynamics’ of General Relativity (GR) had in
fact never been tested, except for the one case of the decay of the binary pulsar orbits,
but this eﬀect is also in the new theory5. As Leonard Schiﬀ realised long ago [14] the
unique dynamical predictions of General Relativity could only be tested in experiments
such as the current Gravity Probe B gyroscope precession experiment, and it is predicted
[10, 11] that the observed precessions will be very diﬀerent from the General Relativity
predictions.

It is important to understand that the new theory of gravity is totally unconnected
to General Relativity, and does not use at all the notion of a spacetime metric; indeed
the very concept of spacetime is totally rejected. In only one special case does it turn
out that mathematically the new theory may be mapped onto the mathematical formal-
ism of General Relativity6, which explains why the latter supposedly had passed certain
checks, but that these circumstances are very restricted, and occur only for the external
Schwarschild metric, namely external to a spherically symmetric matter distribution, and
then only to the extent that we can ignore the small vorticity eﬀects associated with the
absolute motion eﬀect, which is by construction not in General Relativity. Overall the new
theory of gravity is totally incompatible with the formalism of General Relativity, and has
5It is a remarkable insight into the profession of physics when only one recent astronomical observation
is the sole evidence for a theory, but which has attracted so much attention by theoretical physicists,
mathematicians, and philosophers.

6GR, by construction, has no ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, but this eﬀect is observationally apparent in all
situations, except outside of a spherically symmetric matter distribution, but even then causes a shift in
the apparent value of G [1, 2]. Hence the new theory of gravity cannot be mapped onto the GR formalism.
However if we make this ad hoc re-normalisation of G, then in the case of, for example, the GPS the new
theory can be mapped onto GR, which explains why GR, apparently, was successful in the design and
operation of the GPS [13].

a totally diﬀerent ontology. This is evident from the above list of phenomena accounted for
by the new theory; all of these eﬀects are manifest failures of General Relativity. Indeed
it has been an almost pathological state of aﬀairs through C20 physics that rotational
motion was absolute, but linear motion was only relative. This can be traced back to
the incorrect conclusion made by Michelson and Morley when interpreting their smaller
than expected fringe shifts, i.e. based upon Newtonian physics and also based only upon
36 rotations of the interferomter, and despite this error being corrected by Miller in his
extensive experiments of 1925/1926, involving 20,000 rotations thought a year, and that
the time-dependence casued by the orbital motion of the earth about the sun was evident
in Miller’s data.

Herein we explain a key dynamical eﬀect that is apparent already in observations of
absolute motion [7], namely that a highly eﬀective velocity superposition eﬀect is applica-
ble. This means, for example, that in the case of the earth with, in order of magnitude,
(i) a cosmic velocity of the solar system, related it seems, to galactic and local cluster
gravitational quantum-foam ﬂows, (ii) an in-ﬂow of space past the earth towards the sun,
(iii) the tangential orbital velocity of the earth about the sun, and (iv) a gravitational
in-ﬂow into the earth itself, causing its own gravitational eﬀect, that these velocities may
be added vectorially. This is of course totally diﬀerent to what would happen in classical
ﬂuid mechanics, and it would be foolish and naive to make any such comparisons. There
are exceptions to this superposition principle which come into play whenever the absolute
motion of matter with respect to the substratum becomes large compared to c, and this
certainly happens at the centres of stars, for example, where the in-ﬂow velocity becomes
large due to the presence of the new gravitational attractors or ‘black holes’ that are pre-
dicted to be present there, but which have already been detected at the centres of globular
clusters [2, 9]. The violations of this superposition eﬀect are, under normal conditions,
extremely small, and indeed they are the vorticity eﬀects that the Gravity Probe B gy-
roscope experiment will soon begin observing. As previously reported General Relativity
predicts an even smaller vorticity eﬀect (therein called the ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect) than
the new theory of gravity, because it only includes vorticity caused by rotation of the
earth.

The signiﬁcance of the dynamical vector superposition eﬀect is that it explains why the
various observations of absolute motion are consistent with the ‘in-ﬂow’ theory of gravity,
and indeed why the data from the absolute motion experiment of Miller is capable of
revealing the vector component of the in-ﬂow past the earth towards the sun, because the
vector sum changes over the yearly orbit of the earth about the sun.

2 The New Theory of Gravity

Here we ‘derive’ the ‘in-ﬂow’ theory of gravity by re-analysing the implications of Kepler’s
laws for planetary motion. The new theory involves a ‘classical’ velocity ﬁeld [1, 5] and
the theory exhibits (i) the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, with strength set by the ﬁne structure

constant, (ii) eﬀects of absolute motion of the matter with respect to the substratum, and
(iii) vorticity eﬀects also caused by absolute motion of the matter, whether rotational or
translational. This ﬂow theory is a classical description of a quantum foam substructure
to space [1], and the ‘ﬂow’ describes the relative motion of this quantum foam with, as we
now show, gravity arising from inhomogeneities and time variations in that ﬂow. These
gravitational eﬀects can be caused by an in-ﬂow into matter, or even produced purely by
the self-interaction of space itself, as happens for instance for the new ‘black holes’, which
do not contain in-fallen matter.

The Newtonian theory was formulated in terms of a force ﬁeld, the gravitational ac-
celeration g(r, t), and was based on Kepler’s laws for the observed motion of the planets
within the solar system. As we shall see Newton’s theory of gravity is not uniquely deter-
mined by Kepler’s laws, when rewritten in terms of a velocity vector ﬁeld, and introducing
a unique new dynamical term, we immediately obtain the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, as it has

∇.g = −4πGρ.

However there is an alternative formulation [1, 2] in terms of a vector ﬁeld v(r, t) deter-
mined by

Trvially this g also satisﬁes (1). Hence (2)-(3) are mathematically equivalent to (1).
However, and most signiﬁcantly, we shall see that (2)-(3) permit a generalisation that is
not possible for (1). External to a spherical mass M of radius R a velocity ﬁeld solution
of (2) is

also has the same external solution (4), because C(v) = 0 for the ﬂow in (4). So the
presence of the C(v) would not have manifested in the special case of planets in orbit
about the massive central sun. Here α is a dimensionless constant - a new gravitational
constant, in addition to the usual the Newtonian gravitational constant G. However inside
a spherical mass we ﬁnd [2, 9] that C(v) 6= 0, and using the Greenland borehole g anomaly
data we ﬁnd that α−1 = 139±5, which gives the ﬁne structure constant α = e2¯h/c ≈ 1/137

which introduces an eﬀective ‘matter density’ representing the ﬂow dynamics associated
with the C(v) term. However the dynamical eﬀect represented by this new term cannot
be included in the gravitational acceleration dynamics formalism of (1) because it cannot
be expressed in terms of the gravitational ﬁeld g. In [2, 9] this dynamical eﬀect is shown
to be the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect. The interpretation of the vector ﬂow ﬁeld v is that it is
a manifestation, at the classical level, of a quantum substratum to space; the ﬂow is a
rearrangement of that substratum, and not a ﬂow through space. However (6) requires
a further generalisation to include vorticity, and also the eﬀect of the absolute motion of
matter through this substratum. To do this a precise deﬁnition of what is meant by the
velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) is needed. To be speciﬁc and also to deﬁne a possible measurement
procedure we can choose to use the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frame of ref-
erence for that purpose, as this is itself easy to establish. However that does not imply
that the CMB frame is the local ‘quantum-foam’ rest frame. Relative to the CMB frame
and using the local absolute motion detection techniques described in [1, 4, 7], or more
modern techniques that are under development, v(r, t) may be measured in the neighbour-
hood of the observer. Then an ‘object’ at location r0(t) in the CMB frame has velocity
v0(t) = dr0(t)/dt with respect to that frame, and then

vR(r0(t), t) = v0(t) − v(r0(t), t),

(11)

where v0(t) is the velocity of an object, at r0(t), relative to the same frame of reference that
deﬁnes the ﬂow ﬁeld, and vR is the velocity of that matter relative to the substratum. To
take account of the absolute velocity of matter with respect to the local quantum foam and
also of vorticity eﬀects the ﬂow equation (6) is generalised to a 2nd rank tensor equation

Then (12) becomes an integro-diﬀerential equation for the velocity ﬁeld. The presence of
the vi
R terms on the RHS of (12) and (13) are the key to properly understanding the vector
superposition eﬀect7. As discussed in [10] (15) explains the so-called ‘frame-dragging’
eﬀect in terms of this vorticity in the in-ﬂow, but makes predictions very diﬀerent from
General Relativity. These conﬂicting predictions will soon be tested by the Gravity Probe
B satellite experiment. Of course (12)-(13) only make sense if vR(r, t) for the matter at
location r is speciﬁed. We now consider the special case where the matter is subject only
to the eﬀects of motion with respect to the quantum-foam velocity-ﬁeld inhomogeneities
and variations in time, which causes a ‘gravitational’ acceleration.

We note that the ﬁrst serious attempt to construct a ‘ﬂow’ theory of gravity was by
Kirkwood [15, 16]. However the above theory, as expressed in (12)-(13), is very diﬀerent
to Kirkwood’s proposal8. We also note that (12) and (13) need to be further generalised to
take account of the cosmological-scale eﬀects, namely that the spatial system is compact
and growing, as discussed in [1].

3 Geodesics

Process Physics [1] leads to the Lorentzian interpretation of so called ‘relativistic eﬀects’.
This means that the speed of light is only ‘c’ with respect to the quantum-foam system, and
that time dilation eﬀects for clocks and length contraction eﬀects for rods are caused by the
motion of clocks and rods relative to the quantum foam. So these eﬀects are real dynamical
eﬀects caused by motion through the quantum foam, and are not to be interpreted as
non-dynamical spacetime eﬀects as suggested by Einstein. To arrive at the dynamical
description of the various eﬀects of the quantum foam we shall introduce conjectures
that essentially lead to a phenomenological description of these eﬀects. In the future we
expect to be able to derive this dynamics directly from the Quantum Homotopic Field
Theory (QHFT) that describes the quantum foam system [1]. Here we shall conjecture
that the path of an object through an inhomogeneous and time-varying quantum-foam is

representation of Newtonian gravity, and so ipso facto missed the ‘dark matter’ generalisation, the absolute

generalisation of (3) to include Lorentzian dynamical eﬀects, for in (21) we can multiply

to determine the clock rate oﬀsets in the GPS satellites, when the in-ﬂow is given by (4).
So the ﬂuid ﬂow dynamics in (12) and (13) and the gravitational dynamics for the matter
in (19) now form a closed system. This system of equations is a considerable generalisation
from that of Newtonian gravity, and is very diﬀerent from the curved spacetime metric
formalism of General Relativity.

The above may be modiﬁed when the ‘object’ is a massless photon, and the corre-
sponding result leads to the gravitational lensing eﬀect. But not only will ordinary matter
produce such lensing, but the eﬀective ‘dark matter’ density will also do so, and that is
relevant to the recent observation by the weak lensing technique of the so-called ‘dark
matter’ networks.

4 The Velocity Superposition Principle

Despite being non-linear (12)-(13) possess an approximate superposition principle, which
explains why the existence of absolute motion and as well the presence of the C(v) term
appears to have escaped attention in the case of gravitational experiments and observations
near the earth, despite the fact, in the case of the C(v) term, that the presence of the
earth breaks the spherical symmetry of the matter distribution of the sun.

First note that in analysing (12)-(13) we need to recognise two distinct eﬀects: (i) the
eﬀect of a change of description of the ﬂow when changing between observers, and (ii) the
eﬀects of absolute motion of the matter with respect to the quantum foam substratum.
Whether the matter is at rest or in absolute motion with respect to this substratum
does have a dynamical eﬀect, albeit very small. While the Newtonian theory and GR
both oﬀer an account of the ﬁrst eﬀect, and diﬀerent accounts at that, neither have the
second dynamical eﬀect, as this is a unique feature of the new theory of gravity. Let
us consider the ﬁrst eﬀect, as this is somewhat standard.
It basically comes down to
noting that under a change of observer (12)-(13) transform covariantly under a Galilean
transformation. Suppose that according to one observer O the matter density is speciﬁed
by a form ρO(r, t), and that (12)-(13) has a solution vO(r, t), and then with acceleration
gO(r, t) given by (21)9. Then for another observer O′ (and for simplicity we assume
that the observers use coordinate axes that have the same orientation, and that at time
t = 0 they coincide), moving with uniform velocity V relative to observer O, observer O′
describes the matter density with the form ρO′(r, t) = ρO(r + Vt, t). Then, as we now
show, the corresponding solution to (12)-(13) for O′ is exactly

vO′(r, t) = vO(r + Vt, t) − V.

(25)

This is easily established by substitution of (25) into (12)-(13), and noting that the LHS
leads to a RHS where the density has the diﬀerent form noted above, but that vR is
invariant under this change of observer, for each observer agrees on the absolute velocity
of each piece of matter with respect to the local quantum foam. Under the change of
observers, from O to O′, (25) gives

Dij(r, t) → Dij(r + Vt, t) and Ωij(r, t) → Ωij(r + Vt, t).

(26)

Then for the total or Euler ﬂuid derivative in (12) we have for observer O′

as there is a key cancellation of two terms in (27). Clearly then all the terms on the LHS
of (12)-(13) have the same transformation property. Then, ﬁnally, from the form of the
LHS, both equations give the density dependent RHS, but which now involves the form
ρO(r, t)|r → r + Vt , and this is simply ρO′(r, t) given above. If the observers coordinate
axes do not have the same orientation then a time-independent orthogonal similarity
transformation D → SDST , Ω → SΩST , and vi
R arises as well. Hence
the description of the ﬂow dynamics for observers in uniform relative motion is Galilean
covariant. While the transformation rule for the Euler derivative is not a new result, there
are some subtleties in the analysis, as seen above. The subtlety arises because the change of
coordinate variables necessarily introduces a time dependence in the observer descriptions,
even if the ﬂow is inherently stationary. Finally, using an analogous argument to that in
(27), we see explicitly that the acceleration is also Galilean covariant under the above
change of observer, g(r, t) → g(r + Vt, t) (in the case of observer axes with the same
orientation). This simply asserts that all observers actually agree on the gravitational
acceleration, up to the indicated trivial translation eﬀect caused by the motion of the
observer.

We now come to item (ii) above, namely the more subtle but experimentally signiﬁcant
approximate velocity superposition principle. This approximate eﬀect relates to the change
in the form of the solutions of (12)-(13) when the matter density is in motion, as a whole,
with respect to the quantum-foam substratum, as compared to the solutions when the
matter is, as a whole, at rest. Already even these descriptions involve a subtlety. Consider
the case when a star, say, is ‘at rest’ with respect to the substratum. Then the ﬂow
dynamics in (12)-(13) will lead to a position and time dependent ﬂow solution v(r, t).
But that ﬂow leads to a position and time dependent vR(r, t) = v0(r, t) − v(r, t) on the
RHS of (12)-(13), where v0(r, t) is the velocity of the matter at position r and time t
according to some speciﬁc observer’s frame of reference10. Hence the description of the
matter being ‘at rest’ or ‘in motion’ relative to the substratum is far from simple.
In
general, with time-dependent ﬂows, none of the matter will ever be ‘at rest’ with respect
to the substratum, and this description is covariant under a change of observer. In the case
of a well isolated star existing in a non-turbulent substratum we could give the terms ‘at
rest as a whole’ or ‘moving as whole’ a well deﬁned meaning by deciding how the star as
a whole, considered as a rigid body, was moving relative to the more distant unperturbed
substratum. Despite these complexities the solutions of (12)-(13) have, under certain

distribution it is appropriate to introduce the ﬁeld v0(r, t).

conditions, an approximate dynamical velocity superposition principle, namely that if the
ﬂow is vO(r, t), according to some observer O, when the matter is ‘at rest as a whole’,
then when the same matter density is ‘moving as a whole’ with velocity V, then the ﬂow
solution becomes approximately v′
O(r, t) ≈ vO(r−Vt, t), according to the same observer11.
Then if we want the ﬂow ﬁeld for the observer O′ travelling at the same velocity as the
star relative to the quantum foam, then using the exact Galilean transformation in (25)
in conjunction with r → r + Vt, we obtain v′
O′(r, t) ≈ vO(r, t) − V. That is the observer
moving with the star sees approximately the vector sum of the in-ﬂow ﬁeld that the star
would have when ‘at rest as a whole’ and the ‘ﬂow’ −V caused by the star and observer
moving through the substratum with velocity V that the observer would detect in the
absence of the star. To be more explicit about the signs we note that if we move in
a southerly direction, say, against the substratum, then the substratum appears to be
ﬂowing though or past us in a northerly direction. To see why, dynamically, the above
velocity superposition approximation is valid note that the eﬀect of absolute motion of
matter forming the star, with respect to the local substratum, as speciﬁed by vR(r, t),
arises at order (vR/c)2, and also with strength G, which together makes the RHS of (12)
very insensitive to the absolute motion of the matter, and with a similar argument for
the vorticity in (15). So only at the centre of stars, for example, where vR does become
large because of the gravitational attractor eﬀect (viz the black hole eﬀect), see [2], will
It then follows that the derived
this approximate superposition principle breakdown.
acceleration ﬁeld g(r, t) is also approximately unchanged, up to a Galilean transformation
corresponding to an observer dependent change of description, by the ‘motion as a whole’
of the matter through the substratum.

Hence the gravitational acceleration, say of the earth, will only be aﬀected, by its
observed absolute motion, at order (vR/c)2, and this has the approximate value of 10−6.
Note that this approximate dynamical velocity superposition principle is completely dif-
ferent to what would occur if a solid object were moving through a normal classical ﬂuid,
for in this case we obviously would not see any such superposition eﬀect.

For earth based gravitational phenomena the motion of the earth takes place within
the inhomogeneous velocity in-ﬂow towards the sun, in addition to the already observed
absolute ‘cosmic’motion, and the velocity superposition is only approximately valid as now
V → V(r, t) and no longer corresponds to uniform translation, and manifests turbulence.
To be a valid approximation the inhomogeneity of V(r, t) must be much smaller than
that of v(r − Vt, t), which it is, as the earth’s centripetal acceleration about the sun is
approximately 1/1000 that of the earth’s gravitational acceleration at the surface of the
11In the context of the earlier version of the ﬂow equations in [3, 4], namely (6), which lacked both the
absolute motion eﬀect, namely the vR terms, and the vorticity dynamics, this velocity superposition eﬀect
was exact. Then obviously the Galilean covariance is all that is required in order to make the case. This
is evident from the fact that (6) does not contain the velocity of absolute motion of the matter; and so
implies that no dynamical eﬀect can follow from that absolute motion of matter. More explicitly the same
conclusion is reached, in the above, by ﬁnally taking the limit vR/c → 0. The result that (6) has an exact
superposition eﬀect has resulted in some confusion.

earth. Of course the inhomogeneity of the ﬂow towards the sun is what keeps the earth in
its orbit about the sun, and indeed that component of the ﬂow is now understood to be
present in the Miller absolute motion data [7]. So the validity of this velocity superposition
approximation demonstrates that the detection of a cosmic absolute motion and of the
in-ﬂow theory of gravity are consistent with the older methods of computing gravitational
forces. This is why both the presence of the C(v) term, the in-ﬂow and the absolute
motion have gone almost unnoticed in earth based gravitational experiments, except for
the so-called various ‘anomalies’; see [7].

This approximate velocity superposition principle is the key to understanding the
operation of the earth based detections of absolute motion [7]. There are four main
velocities12. that contribute to the total velocity of an observer through space:

v ≈ vcosmic + vtangent − vin − vE.

(28)

Here vcosmic is the velocity of the solar system through space, while the other three are
local eﬀects: (i) vtangent is the tangential orbital velocity of the earth about the sun,
(ii) vin is a quantum-foam radial in-ﬂow past the earth towards the sun, and (iii) the
corresponding quantum-foam in-ﬂow into the earth is vE and makes no contribution to a
horizontally operated interferometer. In constructing (28) we have assumed the validity of
the velocity superposition principle, namely that all components may be added vectorially.
The minus signs in (28) arise because, for example, the in-ﬂow towards the sun requires
the earth to have an outward directed velocity component against that in-ﬂow in order to
maintain a ﬁxed distance from the sun, as shown in Fig.1. For circular orbits vtangent and

where M is the mass of the sun, R is the distance of the earth from the sun, and G is
Newton’s gravitational constant. G is essentially a measure of the rate at which matter
eﬀectively ‘dissipates’ the quantum-foam. The gravitational acceleration of the earth to-
wards the sun arises from inhomogeneities in the vin ﬂow component. These expressions
give vtangent = 30km/s, vin = 42.4km/s and vN = 52km/s. As discussed in [7] vin is
extractable from Miller’s 1925/26 air-mode Michelson interferometer experiment, and so
provided the ﬁrst conﬁrmation of the new ‘ﬂow’ theory of gravity. As noted above the
dynamical explanation for the velocity superposition approximation implies that the grav-
itational entrainment or ‘drag eﬀects’ are very small. Nevertheless they are present and
the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment was designed to detect just such a vorticity eﬀect.
Of course the magnitude of this vorticity eﬀect predicted by the new theory of gravity [9]
is much larger than that predicted by General Relativity, for in this theory only rotation
has an absolute meaning, whereas in the new theory both rotation and linear motion with
respect to the substratum have an absolute meaning, and generate observable vorticity
eﬀects. As well the absolute linear velocity of the earth through the substratum also has
a larger eﬀect on the so-called geodetic precession of the GP-B gyroscopes, than predicted
by General Relativity.

5 Conclusions

The Newtonian theory of gravity and General Relativity have, perhaps somewhat surpris-
ingly, only been tested within very special circumstances; and when they failed in numerous
other circumstances the experimental data was either banned from the physics journals or
spurious explanations were invoked, the most infamous being of course the ‘dark matter’
explanation for the large non-Keplerian orbital velocities of the stars and gas clouds in the
outer regions of spiral galaxies. The new theory of gravity has, however, not only agreed
with the older two theories in those special ‘successful’ tests, but at the same time given
explicit and checkable explanations and quantiﬁed predictions for all the other ‘anomalies’.
In particular we have seen previously that the bore hole g ‘anomaly’ data is directly linked
to the spiral galaxy rotation ‘anomaly’, and that this spatial self-interaction eﬀect, as it is

16

now understood, may be studied in Cavendish laboratory experiments. However the main
result of this paper has been to explain the dynamical eﬀects behind the success of the
velocity superposition eﬀect, an eﬀect already assumed in the initial studies of the vari-
ous absolute motion experiments [6, 7]. Under normal conditions, i.e for absolute motion
experiments on the surface of the earth, the deviations from this superposition principle
are extremely small, and are known variously as ‘entrainment’ in the language of C19
physics, ‘frame-dragging’ in the language of General Relativity, and the ‘vorticity’ eﬀect
in the new theory of gravity. Of course the Newtonian theory has no such eﬀect. The
Gravity Probe B satellite gyroscope experiment has been undertaken to explore exactly
this vorticity eﬀect, together with the geodetic eﬀect, which is unrelated to vorticity. For
both eﬀects the new theory of gravity makes predictions for the precession of the GP-B
gyroscopes that are much larger than predicted by General Relativity, which implies the
prediction that in its ﬁrst experimental dynamical test GR will fail badly. This is because
in GR the eﬀects of the very large, and already observed, absolute velocity of the earth
through the substratum of space is explicitly excluded: absolute linear motion is a concept
absent from GR by deﬁnition, and totally banned from physics. One must always, never-
theless, emphasise that absolute linear motion is completely consistent with the so-called
‘relativistic eﬀects’; these are indeed caused by the dynamical eﬀects of absolute motion.
We are entering an era where the full complexity of the phenomenon of gravitation will
be, for the ﬁrst time, subjected to extensive experimental and observational study, both
by means of astronomical observations, for example the spiral galaxy rotation data and
also the globular cluster black hole mass observations, but also laboratory experiments,
such as those of the Cavendish kind where the eﬀects associated with diﬀerent matter
shapes gives a handle on the α dependent spatial self-interaction eﬀect, which has actually
plagued the accurate determination of G for many decades, and resulted in G being the
most poorly measured fundamental constant. And also most signiﬁcantly we will see the
beginning of systematic observations of the new gravitational wave phenomenon predicted
by the new theory of gravity, and now apparent in existing experimental data.

As argued elsewhere the occurrence of α as a second fundamental gravitational constant
is a major development in our understanding of gravity, and is surely indicating that we
are now entering the phenomena of quantum gravity, and that such eﬀects are much
larger than previously predicted, that is, they do not manifest at the Planck scales. The
argument that the Planck scales set the regime of quantum gravity eﬀects only followed
when there was one gravitational constant, namely G. But of course now we have α being
the second gravitational constant.

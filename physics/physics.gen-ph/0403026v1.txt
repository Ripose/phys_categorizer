POSSIBLE OBSERVATION OF A SECOND KIND OF LIGHT
– MAGNETIC PHOTON RAYS

Rainer W. K¨uhne
Lechstr. 63, 38120 Braunschweig, Germany
kuehne70@gmx.de

Several years ago, I suggested a quantum ﬁeld theory which has many attractive features.
(1) It can explain the quantization of electric charge.
(2) It describes symmetrized
Maxwell equations. (3) It is manifestly covariant. (4) It describes local four-potentials.
(5) It avoids the unphysical Dirac string. My model predicts a second kind of light,
which I named “magnetic photon rays.” Here I will discuss possible observations of this
radiation by August Kundt in 1885, Alipasha Vaziri in February 2002, and Roderic Lakes
in June 2002.

1. The Theoretical Background

1.1. The Model

The existence of the second kind of light was predicted theoretically. It can be

understood by the following argumentation.

In 1948/1949 Tomonaga, Schwinger, Feynman, and Dyson introduced quantum
electrodynamics [1]. It is the quantum ﬁeld theory of electric and magnetic phe-
nomena. This theory has one shortcoming. It cannot explain why electric charge is
quantized, i.e. why it appears only in discrete units.

In 1931 Dirac [2] introduced the concept of magnetic monopoles. He has shown
that any theory which includes magnetic monopoles requires the quantization of
electric charge.

A theory of electric and magnetic phenomena which includes Dirac monopoles
can be formulated in a manifestly covariant and symmetrical way if two four-
potentials are used. Cabibbo and Ferrari in 1962 [3] were the ﬁrst to formulate
such a theory. It was examined in greater detail by later authors [4 – 6]. Within the
framework of a quantum ﬁeld theory one four-potential corresponds to Einstein’s

electric photon from 1905 [7] and the other four-potential corresponds to Salam’s
magnetic photon from 1966 [5].

In 1997 I have shown that the Lorentz force between an electric charge and a
magnetic charge can be generated as follows [6]. An electric charge couples via the
well-known vector coupling with an electric photon and via a new type of tensor
coupling, named velocity coupling, with a magnetic photon. This velocity coupling
requires the existence of a velocity operator.

For scattering processes this velocity is the relative velocity between the electric
charge and the magnetic charge just before the scattering. For emission and ab-
sorption processes there is no possibility of a relative velocity. The velocity is the
absolute velocity of the electric charge just before the reaction.

The absolute velocity of a terrestrial laboratory was measured by the dipole
anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This radiation was de-
tected in 1965 by Penzias and Wilson [8], its dipole anisotropy was detected in 1977
by Smoot, Gorenstein, and Muller [9]. The mean value of the laboratory’s absolute
velocity is 371 km/s. It has an annual sinusoidal period because of the Earth’s mo-
tion around the Sun with 30 km/s. It has also a diurnal sinusoidal period because
of the Earth’s rotation with 0.5 km/s.

According to my model from 1997 [6] each process that produces electric pho-
tons does create also magnetic photons. The cross-section of magnetic photons in
a terrestrial laboratory is roughly one million times smaller than that of electric
photons of the same energy. The exact value varies with time and has both the
annual and the daily period.

As a consequence, magnetic photons are one million times harder to create, to

shield, and to absorb than electric photons of the same energy.

The electric-magnetic duality is:

— magnetic charge
— magnetic current

electric charge
electric current
electric conductivity — magnetic conductivity
electric ﬁeld strength — magnetic ﬁeld strength
electric four-potential — magnetic four-potential
electric photon
electric ﬁeld constant — magnetic ﬁeld constant
dielectricity number — magnetic permeability

— magnetic photon

The refractive index of an insulator is the square root of the product of the
dielectricity number and the magnetic permeability. Therefore it is invariant un-
der a dual transformation. This means that electric and magnetic photon rays
are reﬂected and refracted by insulators in the same way. Optical lenses cannot
distinguish between electric and magnetic photon rays.

By contrast, electric and magnetic photon rays are reﬂected and refracted in a
diﬀerent way by metals. This is because electric conductivity and magnetic con-

38 Rainer W. K¨uhne

ductivity determine the reﬂection of light and they are not identical. The electric
conductivity of a metal is several orders larger than the magnetic conductivity.

1.2. The Formulae for Classical Electromagnetodynamics

Let J µ = (P, J) denote the electric four-current and jµ = (ρ, j) the magnetic
four-current. The well-known four-potential of the electric photon is Aµ = (Φ, A).
The four-potential of the magnetic photon is aµ = (ϕ, a). Expressed in three-vectors
the symmetrized Maxwell equations read,

2. Arguments for an Absolute Rest Frame

Soon after I presented my model of magnetic monopoles [6], I learned that the main
obstacle for most physicists to accept my model was that it requires an absolute
rest frame. For this reason, I will present the arguments for an absolute frame in
this section. The ﬁrst subsection deals with the classical arguments, the second
subsection deals with the arguments based on General Relativity and relativistic
cosmology.

2.1. Space and Time Before General Relativity

According to Aristotle, the Earth was resting in the centre of the universe. He
considered the terrestrial frame as a preferred frame and all motion relative to the
Earth as absolute motion. Space and time were absolute [10].

In the days of Galileo the heliocentric model of Copernicus [11] was valid. The
Sun was thought to be resting within the centre of the universe and deﬁning a
preferred frame. Galileo argued that only relative motion was observed but not
absolute motion. However, to ﬁx motion he considered it as necessary to have not
only relative motion, but also absolute motion [12].

Newton introduced the mathematical description of Galileo’s kinematics. His
equations described only relative motion. Absolute motion did not appear in his
equations [13].

This inspired Leibniz to suggest that absolute motion is not required by the

classical mechanics introduced by Galileo and Newton [14].

Huyghens introduced the wave theory of light. According to his theory, light
waves propagate via oscillations of a new medium which consists of very tiny parti-
cles, which he named aether particles. He considered the rest frame of the luminif-
erous aether as a preferred frame [15].

The aether concept reappeared in Maxwell’s theory of classical electrodynamics
[16]. Faraday [17] uniﬁed Coulomb’s theory of electricity [18] with Amp`ere’s theory
of magnetism [19]. Maxwell uniﬁed Faraday’s theory with Huyghens’ wave theory of
light, where in Maxwell’s theory light is considered as an oscillating electromagnetic
wave which propagates through the luminiferous aether of Huyghens.

We all know that the classical kinematics was replaced by Einstein’s Special
Relativity [20]. Less known is that Special Relativity is not able to answer several
problems that were explained by classical mechanics.

40 Rainer W. K¨uhne

According to the relativity principle of Special Relativity, all inertial frames are
equivalent, there is no preferred frame. Absolute motion is not required, only the
relative motion between the inertial frames is needed. The postulated absence of
an absolute frame prohibits the existence of an aether [20].

According to Special Relativity, each inertial frame has its own relative time.
One can infer via the Lorentz transformations [21] on the time of the other inertial
frames. Absolute space and time do not exist. Furthermore, space is homogeneous
and isotropic, there does not exist any rotational axis of the universe.

It is often believed that the Michelson-Morley experiment [22] conﬁrmed the
relativity principle and refuted the existence of a preferred frame. This believe is
not correct. In fact, the result of the Michelson-Morley experiment disproved the
existence of a preferred frame only if Galilei invariance is assumed. The experi-
ment can be completely explained by using Lorentz invariance alone, the relativity
principle is not required.

By the way, the relativity principle is not a phenomenon that belongs solely to
Special Relativity. According to Leibniz it can be applied also to classical mechanics.

Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity has three problems.

(i) The space of Special Relativity is empty. There are no entities apart from the
observers and the observed objects in the inertial frames. By contrast, the space of
classical mechanics can be ﬁlled with, say, radiation or turbulent ﬂuids.

(ii) Without the concept of an aether Special Relativity can only describe but

not explain why electric and magnetic ﬁelds oscillate in propagating light waves.

(iii) Special Relativity does not satisfy the equivalence principle [23] of General
Relativity, according to which inertial mass and gravitational mass are identical.
Special Relativity considers only inertial mass.

Special Relativity is a valid approximation of reality which is appropriate for
the description of most of the physical phenomena examined until the beginning of
the twenty-ﬁrst century. However, the macroscopic properties of space and time are
better described by General Relativity.

2.2. General Relativity: Absolute Space and Time

In 1915 Einstein presented the ﬁeld equations of General Relativity [24] and in
1916 he presented the ﬁrst comprehensive article on his theory [25].
In a later
work he showed an analogy between Maxwell’s theory and General Relativity. The
solutions of the free Maxwell equations are electromagnetic waves while the solutions
of the free Einstein ﬁeld equations are gravitational waves which propagate on
an oscillating metric [26]. As a consequence, Einstein called space the aether of
General Relativity [27]. However, even within the framework of General Relativity
do electromagnetic waves not propagate through a luminiferous aether.

Einstein applied the ﬁeld equations of General Relativity on the entire universe
[28]. He presented a solution of a homogeneous, isotropic, and static universe, where
the space has a positive curvature. This model became known as the Einstein
universe. However, de Sitter has shown that the Einstein universe is not stable
against density ﬂuctuations [29].

This problem was solved by Friedmann and Lemaˆitre who suggested a homoge-

neous and isotropic expanding universe where the space is curved [30].

Robertson and Walker presented a metric for a homogeneous and isotropic uni-
verse [31]. According to G¨odel this metric requires an absolute time [32]. In any
homogeneous and isotropic cosmology the Hubble constant [33] and its inverse,
In the
the Hubble age of the universe, are absolute and not relative quantities.
Friedmann-Lemaˆitre universe there exists a relation between the actual age of the
universe and the Hubble age.

According to Bondi and Gold, a preferred motion is given at each point of space
by cosmological observations, namely the redshift-distance relation generated by
the Hubble eﬀect. It appears isotropic only for a unique rest frame [34].

I argued that the Friedmann-Lemaˆitre universe has a ﬁnite age and therefore a
ﬁnite light cone. The centre-of-mass frame of this Hubble sphere can be regarded
as a preferred frame [6].

After the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Penzias
and Wilson [8], it was predicted that it should have a dipole anisotropy generated
by the Doppler eﬀect by the Earth’s motion. This dipole anisotropy was predicted
in accordance with Lorentz invariance [35] and later discovered experimentally [9].
Peebles called these experiments “aether drift experiments” [36].

The preferred frames deﬁned by the Robertson-Walker metric, the Hubble eﬀect,
and the cosmic microwave background radiation are probably identical. In this case
the absolute motion of the Sun was determined by the dipole anisotropy experiments
of the cosmic microwave background radiation to be (371

1) km/s.

3. Three Experiments to Verify the Magnetic Photon Rays

3.1. How to Verify the Magnetic Photon Rays

The easiest test to verify/falsify the magnetic photon is to illuminate a metal foil
of thickness 1, . . . , 100µm by a laser beam (or any other bright light source) and
to place a detector (avalanche diode or photomultiplier tube) behind the foil. If a
single foil is used, then the expected reﬂection losses are less than 1%. If a laser
beam of the visible light is used, then the absorption losses are less than 15%. My
model [6] predicts the detected intensity of the radiation to be

f = r(v/c)4

(17)

42 Rainer W. K¨uhne

times the intensity that would be detected if the metal foil were removed and the
laser beam would directly illuminate the detector. Here

v = vsun + vearth cos(2πt/Te) cos(ϕec) + vrotation cos(2πt/Trot) cos(ϕeq)

(18)

is the absolute velocity of the laboratory. The absolute velocity of the Sun as
measured by the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation
is

The mean velocity of the Earth around the Sun is

vsun = (371

0.5)km/s.

vearth = 30km/s.

The rotation velocity of the Earth is

vrotation = 0.5km/s cos(ϕ).

The zero point of the time, t = 0, is reached on December 9 at 0:00 local time. The
speed of light is denoted by c. The factor for losses by reﬂection and absorption of
magnetic photon rays of the visible light for a metal foil of thickness 1, . . . , 100µm
is

r = 0.8, . . . , 1.0.

To conclude, my model [6] predicts the value f

10−12.

More precisely, this value is correct only for interactions of free electric charges
with photons. In these situations the cross-section of magnetic photons is reduced

by the factor (v/c)2 for emission and absorption processes with respect to the cross-
section of magnetic photons of the same energy. Since in metals we do not have
free electric charges nor free photons, this value has to be modiﬁed.

3.2. The Experiment by August Kundt

In Strassbourg in 1885, August Kundt [37] passed sunlight through red glass, a
polarizing Nicol, and platinized glass which was covered by an iron layer. The
entire experimental setup was placed within a magnetic ﬁeld. With the naked
eye, Kundt measured the Faraday rotation of the polarization plane generated by
the transmission of the sunlight through the iron layer. His result was a constant
maximum rotation of the polarization plane per length of 418, 000◦/cm or 1◦ per
23.9nm. He veriﬁed this result until thicknesses of up to 210nm and rotations of up
to 9◦.

In one case, on a very clear day, he observed the penetrating sunlight for rota-
tions of up to 12◦. Unfortunately, he has not given the thickness of this particular
iron layer he used. But if his result of a constant maximum rotation per length can
be applied, then the corresponding layer thickness was

290nm.

Let us recapitulate some classical electrodynamics to determine the behavior of

Reﬂection losses by haze in the atmosphere further reduce this value.

Kundt’s observation of sunlight which penetrated through iron layers of up to
290nm thickness can hardly be explained by classical electrodynamics. Air bubbles

additional rotation, cannot completely be ruled out as the explanation. However,
impurities are not a likely explanation, because Kundt was able to reproduce his
observation by using several layers which he examined at various places.

Quantum eﬀects cannot explain the observation, because they decrease the pen-

etration depth, whereas an increment would be required.

The observation may become understandable if Kundt has observed a second
kind of electromagnetic radiation, the magnetic photon rays. I predict their pene-
tration depth to be

δm = δ(c/v)2

To learn whether Kundt has indeed observed magnetic photon rays, his experiment
has to be repeated.

3.3. The Experiment by Alipasha Vaziri

On February 22, 2002 between 15:30 and 16:30 local time of Vienna/Austria, Ali-
pasha Vaziri tried an experiment to verify my predicted magnetic photon rays. As
a light source he used a He-Ne laser of 1 milli Watt power and wavelength 632 nano
meters. He coupled the light in a multi mode optical ﬁbre with coupling eﬃciency
of 70%. The light came out at the other end. After 3 centi meters he coupled the
light in a second multi mode glass ﬁbre, also with coupling eﬃciency of 70%. In
front of the second optical ﬁbre he placed an aluminium foil to shield the electric
photon light. Behind the second optical ﬁbre he placed an avalanche diode with
30% eﬃciency for electric photon light of 632 nano meters wavelength as a detector.

He did four sets of runs. Each run lasted for 10 seconds.
In the ﬁrst set the laser illuminated the foil. The eﬀective power of the laser was
56 micro Watts, because the sensitive area of the optical ﬁbres was smaller than
the cross-section of the laser beam. The counts of the 15 runs were:

350, 341, 339, 338, 337, 338, 331, 333, 336, 333, 325, 327, 341, 335, 343.

For the second set the laser was oﬀ. The counts of the 14 runs were:

344, 332, 329, 337, 332, 336, 338, 336, 343, 336, 330, 344, 333, 338.
For the third set of experiments, he placed optical lenses between the two optical
ﬁbres to focus the laser beam. The eﬀective power of the laser was 1 milli Watt.
The counts of these 17 foreground runs were:
367, 343, 345, 356, 339, 348, 345, 355, 353, 358, 346, 352, 345, 347, 342, 342, 345.
For the fourth set, the optical lenses were placed between the optical ﬁbres and the
laser was oﬀ. The counts of the 15 runs were:

336, 337, 330, 345, 341, 345, 340, 337, 339, 343, 345, 337, 332, 340, 330.
In total, he made 44 background runs and 17 foreground runs. The mean back-
ground count rates were:

set 1: 33.65 counts/s
set 2: 33.63 counts/s
set 4: 33.85 counts/s
mean : 33.71 counts/s

set 3: 34.87 counts/s

The mean foreground count rate was:

Therefore the excessive count rate was 1.16 counts/s.

The error bar can be estimated as follows. Two thirds of all data points should
be within the one-sigma error bar, 95% of all data points should be within the two-
sigma error bar. The individual error bar is therefore 6 counts for the 44 background
runs and 7 counts for the 17 foreground runs. The total error bar can be calculated
by dividing the individual error bar through the square-root of the number of runs.
Hence, the total error bar for the background is 0.9 counts, that of the foreground

46 Rainer W. K¨uhne

is 1.7 counts.

The count rates are therefore:

foreground : (34.87
background : (33.71
excess rate: ( 1.16

0.17) counts/s
0.09) counts/s
0.19) counts/s

±
±
±

The statistical signiﬁcance of the result is therefore 6 sigma.

There is another interesting point. All of the 17 foreground counts are larger
than the mean of the 44 background counts. The probability for this by pure chance
is 1 : 217 = 1 : 131072.

It is diﬃcult to explain the small excess rate by conventional eﬀects.
(1) The statistical signiﬁcance is 6 standard deviations.
(2) The foreground runs were made between the second and third background
measurements. The mean count rate of set 4, which directly followed the foreground
set, is close to those of sets 1 and 2. Therefore a variability of the detector system
(dark count rate) is not a likely explanation.

(3) Background set 4 was started directly after the foreground set was termi-
nated. The count rate dropped simultaneously. Therefore it is unlikely that the
excessive count rate resulted from electronic noise by equipment either inside or
outside the laboratory.

(4) The two optical lenses were used to focus the laser beam, so they should
have decreased eﬀects of stray light. It is therefore unlikely that the excess is due
to stray light.

(5) The penetration depth of electric photon light of 632 nano meters in alu-
minium is only 3.68 nano meters. Hence, the excess rate is not due to transmitted
electric photon light.

(6) The excessive count rate is at least 7 orders of magnitude too small to be
explicable by electric photon light which transmitted the aluminium foil through a
pinhole or hairline crack, respectively.

(7) Because of the second optical ﬁbre, the electric photon light of the laser

cannot have heated the avalanche detector.

3.4. The Experiment by Roderic Lakes

The third experiment was performed by Roderic Lakes in Madison/Wisconsin in
June 2002. As a light source he used a diode pumped YAG laser at 532 nano
meters with 80 milli Watts of power. The detector was a photomultiplier with a
quantum eﬃciency of 10% for green electric photon light and a variable dark count
rate between 5 and 30 counts/s. The diameter of the detector was 6.5 milli meters.
An aluminium foil was placed directly in front of the detector.

Roderic Lakes made 4 foreground sets and 3 background sets. Each set consisted

Possible observation of . . .

47

of 6 runs. Each run lasted for 10 seconds. The foreground and background sets
alternated.

The measured eﬀect of the laser was 5 counts per second above background.

It is diﬃcult to explain this excess by conventional eﬀects.

(1) The foreground consisted of 5400 counts within 240 seconds. The mean
foreground count rate was signiﬁcantly greater than the mean background count
rate. The background consisted of only 3200 counts within 180 seconds.

(2) Foreground and background measurements alternated. Therefore a variabil-
ity of the detector is unlikely. For the same reason, it is unlikely that the excess
results from noise of equipment either inside or outside the laboratory.

(3) The penetration depth of electric photon light of 532 nano meters in alu-
minium is only 3.38 nano meters. Hence, the excess rate is not due to transmitted
electric photon light.

(4) The excessive count rate is at least 8 orders of magnitude too small to be
explicable by electric photon light which transmitted the aluminium foil through a
pinhole or hairline crack, respectively.

I have to point out that neither Alipasha Vaziri nor Roderic Lakes claim to have
detected a new eﬀect. They wrote me that they disagree with my interpretation
of their experiments (personal communications from Alipasha Vaziri and Roderic
Lakes, June 12, 2003). Further experiments have to be done to ensure that the
excessive count rates have indeed been generated by magnetic photon rays.

4. Consequences

The observation of magnetic photon rays would be a multi-dimensional revolu-

tion in physics. Its implications would be far-reaching.

(1) The experiment would provide evidence of a second kind of electromagnetic
radiation. The penetration depth of these magnetic photon rays is roughly one
million times greater than that of electric photon light of the same wavelength.
Hence, these new rays may ﬁnd applications in medicine where X-ray and ultrasonic
diagnostics are not useful. X-ray examinations include a high risk of radiation
damages, because the examination of teeth requires high intensities of X-rays and
genitals are too sensible to radiation damages. Examinations of bones and the brain
may also become possible.

(2) A positive result would provide evidence of an extension of (quantum) elec-
trodynamics which includes a symmetrization of Maxwell’s equations from 1873
[16].

(3) My model describes both an electric current and a magnetic current, even in
experimental situations which do not include magnetic charges. This new magnetic
current has a larger speciﬁc resistance in conductors than the electric current. It

may ﬁnd applications in electronics.

(4) The intensity of the magnetic photon rays should depend on the absolute
velocity of the laboratory. The existence of the absolute velocity would violate Ein-
stein’s relativity principle of special relativity from 1905 [20]. It would be interesting
to learn whether there exist further eﬀects of absolute motion.

(5) The supposed non-existence of an absolute rest frame was the only argument
against the existence of a luminiferous aether [20]. If the absolute velocity does exist,
we have to ask whether aether exists and what its nature is.

(6) Magnetic photon rays may contribute to our understanding of several as-
trophysical and high energy particle physics phenomena where relativistic absolute
velocities appear and where electric and magnetic photon rays are expected to be
created in comparable intensities.

Lakes (University of Wisconsin/Madison) who tried the experiments to verify the
magnetic photon rays.

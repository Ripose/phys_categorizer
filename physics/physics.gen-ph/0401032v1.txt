Abstract

In the context of the fact that the existence of dark energy causing
the accelerated expansion of the universe has been conﬁrmed by the
WMAP and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we re-examine gravitation
itself, starting with the formulation of Sakharov and show that it is
possible to obtain gravitation in terms of the electromagnetic charge
of elementary particles, once the ZPF and its eﬀects at the Compton
scale are taken into account.

1 Introduction

Some years ago the author had put forward a model in which dark energy in
the form of a background Zero Point Field would lead to an accelerating and
expanding universe [1, 2, 3, 4]. Subsequently observations of distant Type 1A
Supernovae by Perlmutter, Schmidt and others conﬁrmed that the universe
was indeed accelerating and expanding [5, 6]. However ﬁnal conﬁrmation
for the dark energy contribution to this observed acceleration and expansion
was awaited. This conﬁrming evidence has now been obtained through the
observations of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey [7]. In the light of the above observational evidence, we
will now try to reexamine and characterize gravitation and electromagnetism.

2 Gravitation

Our starting point is the 1967 analysis of Sakharov [8, 9]. He starts with the
space time and curvature action integral of General Relativity

−

gR

(dx)√

S(R) =

1
16πG Z
He then observes that the action (1) implies a metrical elasticity of space,
that is generalized forces opposing the curving of space. He then goes on
to the suggestion of Zeldovich [10], “... the gravitational interactions could
lead to a “small” dusturbance of this equilibrium and thus to a ﬁnite value of
Einstein’s cosmological constant, in agreement with the recent interpretation
of the astrophysical data.”
Expanding the Lagrangian density function in (1) in a power series in R, the
scalar curvature, we get

(1)

L(R) = L(0) + A

where A and B are of the order of 1.
Sakharov then identiﬁes the universal constant of gravitation from the second
term in (2) as

There is a divergence in the denominator of (3). To circumvent this Sakharov
R
postulates a minimum length cut oﬀ at the Planck scale, that is a cut oﬀ at
the Planck mass, 10−5gm.
If we implement this cut oﬀ in (3) we get

Gm2

P ∼
The importance of the above considerations is that they show that, “...the
magnitude of the gravitational interaction is determined by the masses and
equations of motion of free particles, and also, probably, by the momentum
cut oﬀ.” More explicitly the above analysis demotes gravitation to the ana-
logue of elasticity in Chemical Physics, that is a mere statistical measure of
residual energies (Cf.ref.[9]). (We will further justify this in this sequel). On
the other hand it must also be borne in mind that the Planck mass particle is

not an elementary particle. It would at the scale of Planck dimensions decay
in 10−42seconds. Moreover Rosen has shown that it would constitute a mini
universe in itself [11].
Nevertheless it is possible to extend the above arguments and get results in
the observable realm of elementary particles by considering the background
Zero Point Field (ZPF) or Dark Energy alluded to earlier (Cf.ref.[12, 13, 14,
15].
We note that as is well known, such a background ZPF can explain the
Quantum Mechanical spin half as also the anomalous g = 2 factor for an
otherwise purely classical electron [16, 17]. The key point here is (Cf.ref.[16])
that the classical angular momentum ~r
m~v does not satisfy the Quantum
Mechanical commutation rule for the angular momentum ~J. However when
we introduce the background Zero Point Field, the momentum now becomes

~J = ~r

where ~A0 is the vector potential associated with the ZPF and ~B is an external
magnetic ﬁeld introduced merely for convenience, and which can be made
vanishingly small.
It can be shown that ~J in (5) satisﬁes the Quantum Mechanical commutation
~J. At the same time we can deduce from (5)
relation for ~J

Relation (6) gives the correct Quantum Mechanical results referred to above.

(7) shows that the mean dimension of the region in which the ﬂuctuation
contributes is of the order of the Compton wavelength of the electron.
As a further conﬁrmation, we can similarly deduce that there is a mean time
interval of the order of the electrons’ Compton time. For this we note that
the energy of the ZPF is given by [17]

there is due to the Compton scale average a further contribution at the cut
oﬀ length l which is the Compton wavelength of an elementary particle, the
corresponding mass being the mass of an elementary particle.
(13) is well known [18, 12, 19]. Its signiﬁcance in the above context will be
seen below. If we now use the extra contribution to (4) with (14) we deduce

In other words the extra contribution to the action integrals in (1) or (2) from
the Compton scale ZPF eﬀects leads to a characterization of a gravitational
constant in terms of the electric charge. Looking at it another way, this
points to a uniﬁed description of gravitation and electromagnetism, because
(15) is no longer ad hoc or empirical, but rather is a consequence of the
theory.
Let us now look at how relation (13) can be arrived at from the point of view

Due to this ﬂuctuation which is of the order √N, the excess electromagnetic
energy is given by the expression

If we now use the well known relation (Cf.ref.[12, 20, 21])

in the above, the excess energy comes out as

M is the mass of the universe which equals Nm, m being the mass of a
typical elementary particle. (16) is the contribution due to the ﬂuctuation in
the number of particles. The question is can this energy due to the particle

which can be seen to be of the same order as (16) or its predecessor.
In other words the ﬂuctuating energy of the ZPF at the Compton scale gives
the entire energy of the elementary particle, on the one hand. On the other
hand this equality of (16) and (18) shows that

3 Discussion

1. We have seen that the ZPF can be associated with the ﬂuctuation in
the number of particles in the considerations leading to (16). Another way
of looking at Sakharov’s formulation in (2) and the following considerations
is that if we write the Lagrangian in (2) for the √N particles, then A gets
multiplied by this factor and instead of (4), we will get, as before, (15).
Indeed the fact that the two approaches lead to identical conclusions is due
to the fact that t = √N τ , a relation which infact can be deduced from the
theory (Cf.ref.[1]), and the relation which is equivalent to the well known

¯hc
l4

Eddington formula r = √Nl.
2. It is interesting that the ZPF eﬀects as discussed in equations (5), 7), (8),
(12) and (17) bear a strong resemblance to similar zitterbewegung eﬀects at
the same scale in the Quantum Mechanical treatment of an electron, and can
be identiﬁed with the latter. This is similar to the case of the ZPF at the
scale of the atomic radius giving rise to the Lamb Shift.
3. The considerations leading to (7) or (12) via (8) and (10), as also the
equation (17) point to the fact that it is possible to consider the mass of an
elementary particle being generated by the ZPF at the Compton scale. This
has been discussed in detail in (Cf.ref.[22]).
4. The signiﬁcance of the ZPF considerations vis-a-vis the curvature of space
is the followintg: It is well known that the ﬂuctuation in the scalar curvature
in a region of extent λ is given by

10−33cms (Cf.ref.[9]). Usually this quantity
where lP is the Planck length
is miniscule. When λ = l the Compton wavelength of for example is electron,
then it can be seen from (20) that ∆R is not only not small but infact is of
the order 1. Thus we have a huge ﬂuctuation at the Compton scale.
√N referred to above, has

to consider a modiﬁed Coulomb potential proportional to 1

This shows that the wave function and therefore the particle is conﬁned to a
region roughly of the order of the Compton wavelength l itself. We thus get
a rationale for quark conﬁnement. For the region x much greater than l, the
potential in (21) behaves like the normal Coulumb potential.
7. Following the above remarks, it is interesting to note the following. Very
much in this spirit, it was argued that [25] a neutrino has a small electrical
charge

dred millionth that of the electron, as was subsequently conﬁrmed by the

9. A problem which has vexed Physicists is the matter anti-matter asymme-
try. It may be pointed out that in the light of the above considerations, it
is possible to give an argument from probability theory itself. Let us sup-
pose that the probability for the creation of particles and anti-particles is
the same, as for example the probability for giving birth to a boy or a girl.
However in this latter case, the probability that any family with several chil-
dren has exactly half the number of boys is infact less than half. A similar
argument would apply to matter and anti-matter.

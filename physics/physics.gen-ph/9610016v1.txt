Abstract

Using the Unruh-DeWitt detector, it is shown that a universal and continuous

Lorentz transformation of temperature cannot exist for black-body radiation.

Since any valid Lorentz transformation of temperature must be able to deal

with black-body radiation, it is concluded that a universal and continuous

temperature transformation does not exist.

This note represents yet another attempt to lay the ghost of the relativistic temperature

transformation which has motivated a number of papers by the founders of relativity and

quantum mechanics [1]– [5], more than 60 contributions during 1963-1968 [6] (see e.g. [7]–

[15]), and a continuing trickle ever since (see e.g. [16]– [28] and references therein). The

new result which makes the present considerations worthwhile is the explicit formula for the

excitation rate of an Unruh–DeWitt detector, i.e. a two-level monopole [29], which has a

single proper energy gap ¯hω′, and detects massless scalar particles or, equivalently, “spinless

photons”. Suppose that black-body radiation with proper temperature T is at rest in some

inertial frame S. The excitation rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector moving with constant

velocity v through it is found, with the aid of quantum ﬁeld theory, to be proportional to

the particle number density [26]

Here we use “ ′ ” to refer to quantities as measured in S′, which is the inertial frame in which

By a black body we mean a system which has a Planckian spectrum, and by black-

body temperature the parameter which characterizes this spectrum; so if one looks for the

temperature of a black-body as deﬁned in the moving frame S′, one needs to express (1) in

If one succeeds, then one would be able to

say that temperature transforms under boosts according to the law T ′ = T ′(T, v). However,

such a transformation is easily shown mathematically not to exist. In particular, the popular

1 (see e.g. [1]- [5], [11], [28]), a = +1 (see e.g [7], [9]) or

a = 0 (see e.g. [12], [15], [21]) are useless in this context because, again, they do not reduce

(1) to (3). Since any universal continuous relativistic temperature transformation has to be

able to deal at least with the black-body case, we conclude that such a transformation does

not exist.

What can be said is that an observer at rest in S′, and looking at the radiation in a

frequency interval dω′ coming from the solid angle interval dΩ′, ﬁnds indeed a variant of (3):

result was rediscovered later in connection with studies of the 2.7 K background radiation,

e.g. [30], and so has become well–known.) Thus, it should be clear that, regrettably, one

cannot discover the desired transformation T ′(T, v) used in Eq. (3) by averaging the elegant

result (5) over solid angles. One ﬁnds instead

This states what is at ﬁrst sight a surprising result: Eq. (1) is found exactly; this time,

therefore, without any appeal to quantum ﬁeld theory.

Any deﬁnition based on some operational procedure, like: “Temperature is what some

pre-chosen device in S′ measures” will be arbitrary because diﬀerent “thermometers”, and

measuring procedures will lead to diﬀerent functional dependencies. For example, if we

construct a thermometer which measures the average of (6), T ′

Clearly T ′

aver1(T, v = 0) = T ′

aver2(T, v = 0) = T . In fact, a good thermometer is a device

which measures a temperature T [see Eq. (2)], when it is at rest with the thermal bath.

Other operational procedures to measure temperature based on Unruh-DeWitt detectors are

equally possible, and also give diﬀerent results [26].

Previous writers were often concerned with the manipulation of Lorentz transformations

of thermodynamical variables such as energy, volume, entropy, etc. This approach leads

to doubtful results [see the discussion of Eq. (4)] unless the theory is made intrinsically

covariant (see e.g. [15], [23] for former, and [24] for more recent formulations).

In this

case four-tensors Sµ, Qµ, etc, replace some of the usual thermodynamical variables like

entropy, heat, etc, and their signiﬁcance then goes beyond the normal thermodynamics.

(For example, by writing the entropy four-ﬂux as Sµ = Suµ, where uµ is the four-velocity

associated with equilibrium states, the usual entropy is given by projecting Sµ on uµ.) It will

be noted that our approach has by-passed this problem since we are discussing this issue from

a microscopic rather than a macroscopic point of view, and no explicitly thermodynamical

arguments are needed.

It might be thought that a rough way of seeing that no black-body equivalent temperature

exists for a radiation enclosure moving relative to an observer may be by noting simply that,

because of the angle dependence in (5), this equation cannot be associated with a legitimate

thermal bath (which is necessarily isotropic). While this view is correct, we have in this

paper gone beyond this observation by obtaining the angle-averaged Eq. (5) in the form of

Eq. (1). This has the merit of linking the above simple observations with earlier works and

making the case against the temperature transformation much more explicit.

In summary, our main conclusion is that because the temperature concept of a black body

is unavoidably associated with the Planckian thermal spectrum, and because a bath which is

thermal in an inertial frame S is non-thermal in an inertial frame S′, which moves with some

velocity v

= 0 with respect to S, a universal relativistic temperature transformation T ′ =

T ′(T, v) cannot exist. Thus the proper temperature T alone is left as the only temperature

of universal signiﬁcance. This seems to complete a story started 90 years ago [1] of how the

usual temperature transforms, and to conclude a controversy [7] of 33 years’ standing.

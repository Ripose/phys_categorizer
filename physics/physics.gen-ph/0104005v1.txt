Abstract. The Poynting vector, energy density and energy velocity of light pulses
propagating in anomalous dispersion medium (used in WKD-like experiments) are
calculated. Results show that a negative energy density in the medium propagates
along opposite of incident direction with such a velocity similar to the negative group
velocity while the direction of the Poynting vector is positive. In other words, one
might say that a positive energy density in the medium would propagate along the
positive direction with a speed having approximately the absolute value of the group
velocity. We further point out that neither energy velocity nor group velocity is a
good concept to describe the propagation process of light pulse inside the medium in
WKD experiment owing to the strong accumulation and dissipation eﬀects.

Wang, Kuzmich and Dogaiu claim that they have observed the superluminal light propagation by
sending the probe laser pulses through the particularly prepared atomic caesium vapour and measuring
the deviation of the refractive index of the medium from that of the vacuum and the arrival time of the
pulses[1, 2]. Their main conclusion is that the light pulse propagates through the medium with group velocity
about
c/310. Some comments on the WKD experiment have been made [3–6] in diﬀerent ways. Recently,
we analyse the negative group velocity and distortion of light pulse in the anomalous dispersion medium with
two gain lines and show that although the shape of the light pulses seems to be almost preserved in a speciﬁc
view, the distortion is still too large to use the concept of the group velocity to describe the propagation
of the light in the medium[7]. In the present letter, we shall study the Poynting vector, energy density and
energy velocity of light pulse in the anomalous dispersion medium.

Without loss of generality, let the incident light pulse go to the medium at z = 0 from vacuum in z < 0.
The electric and magnetic ﬁelds E(r, t) and H(r, t) of the light pulse propagating in the medium in the
z-direction can be expanded by complex Fourier series as

E(z, t) =

dωE(z, ω)e

It should be noted that the bars denoting the time average can be and hence have been moved inside the
derivative operators on the left-hand side of Eq.(26). It should also be noted that in Eq.(27), A(z, t) is
the complex envelop of the electric ﬁeld, while H(z, t) is the real strength of magnetic ﬁeld given by Eq.(2).
Eq.(26) is the diﬀerential conservation equation of the electromagnetic energy. ¯w is the diﬀerence between the
mean internal energy per unit volume with and without the electromagnetic ﬁeld[8]. It may be interpreted
as the electromagnetic energy density in the medium when the light pulse gets through. Q is the mean heat
evolved per unit time and volume, representing the absorption (or dissipation) rate of energy per unit volume.
The negative absorption (or dissipation) means that there exits gain (or accumulation) in the medium. One
can deﬁne the velocity of transfer of energy density (i.e. energy velocity) as

It can be checked that Eq.(26) holds for the Guassian pulse with Eqs.(12), (16) and (29) if the terms in
Eq.(20), the terms containing f ′′′(0) and higher order terms are neglected. In the approximation,

so that ¯w < 0.
If one interpreted ¯w as the electromagnetic energy density of the pulse in the medium,
then the electromagnetic energy density in the medium would be negative! Besides, the direction of increase
A(z, t)
of energy density in the medium would be the opposite of that of
! The negative energy velocity

vg < 0 would then imply that the negative energy density propagates in the opposite of the incident

direction.

To recover the positivity of energy density, one can replace ¯w in Eq.(26) by

¯U = U0 + ¯w

with

U0 = const. > 0.

U0 is the zero-point energy density coming from the preparation of the medium so that the atomic population
inverted, the part of electromagnetic energy of two beams for preparing the system being stored in caesium
atoms. The probe pulse through the medium will cause that the number of inverted atomic population, so
as the total energy density, decreases at some time. This is in accordance with the fact that the negative
oscillator strength is assigned to obtain Eq.(19) [2, 10]. U0 also sets the upper limit of the intensity of light.
It reﬂects the possible saturation eﬀect[1, 2]. The negative energy density propagating in the opposite of the
incident direction is equivalent to the positive energy density propagating with
< c along the incident
direction at any z in the medium. Mathematically, one may deﬁne the energy velocity in this case as

It implies that the propagation of positive energy density is subluminal at every point.

It seems that there is a contradiction between the subluminal propagation of positive energy density
and the peak of pulse arriving at the exit of the medium earlier than through the vacuum, even earlier than
arriving at the entrance of the medium. However, the contradiction would exist only if Q could be negligible.
In fact, Q in WKD experiment cannot be neglected. For the Gaussian pulse Eq.(10),

∂ ¯w

(34)

(35)

Im(ωs) depends on t and z. Its typical value for the pulse is about 106s−1. While

where the second term in Eq.(25) has been neglected because it is much smaller than the other two terms.
The ﬁrst term in the braces in Eq.(35) gives a constant gain (or accumulation) rate, which is three orders

times. The second term, depending on z, and the third term, depending on both t and z, contribute the gain
(or accumulation) and absorption (or dissipation) rates, respectively, and are about two orders of magnitude
greater than the typical value of ωs. It is the latter two terms that are responsible for the advancement shift
of the pulse. The second term shows that the gain rate increases as z increases. The third term shows that
the absorption rate takes the minimum value at t = t0 +κ1z. Although the absorption rate is time-symmetric
around t = t0 + κ1z, the eﬀect is very diﬀerent because the intensity of light is very small when t < t0 + κ1z
and becomes larger when t > t0 + κ1z. In words, the gain (or accumulation) rate in WKD-like experiments
are not constant as expected in [2].

Combining the study on the propagation of the wave front with a step-function in [7], we can now give
the following picture for the WKD experiment: The leading edge of the Guassian pulse entering the medium
induces the gain (or accumulation) eﬀect that makes the peak of the pulse to appear at the exit of the
medium earlier than it through the vacuum. At later time when the peak of the pulse reaches the medium,
the absorption (or dissipation) eﬀect becomes more important, and so that a part of the pulse energy would
be dissipated inside the medium. Thus the peak at the exit of the medium should not be the entrance
peak. This picture is in agreement with Zhang’s argument about gain eﬀect[11], McDonald’s energy loan
argument[3], as well as Sprangle-Pe˜nano-Haﬁzi’s diﬀerential gain argument[5]. In other words, the process
of the pulse through the caesium vapour is not a simple propagation process of energy because there exists
strong interaction between the light pulse and the medium. In this sense, the energy velocity as well as the
group velocity are all not good concepts of describing the process of light pulse propagating through the
medium in WKD experiment.

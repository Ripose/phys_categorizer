DOES ANTIMATTER EMIT
A NEW LIGHT ?

Abstract

Contemporary theories of antimatter have a number of insuﬃciencies which stim-
ulated the recent construction of the new isodual theory based on a certain anti-
isomorphic map of all (classical and quantum) formulations of matter called isoduality.
In this note we show that the isodual theory predicts that antimatter emits a new
light, called isodual light, which can be distinguished from the ordinary light emit-
ted by matter via gravitational interactions (only). In particular, the isodual theory
predicts that all stable antiparticles such as the isodual photon, the positron and the
antiproton experience antigravity in the ﬁeld of matter (deﬁned as the reversal of the
sign of the curvature tensor). The antihydrogen atom is therefore predicted to: expe-
rience antigravity in the ﬁeld of Earth; emit the isodual photon; and have the same
spectroscopy of the hydrogen atom, although subjected to an anti-isomorphic isodual
map. In this note we also show that the isodual theory predicts that bound states of
elementary particles and antiparticles (such as the positronium) experience ordinary
gravitation in both ﬁelds of matter and antimatter, thus bypassing known objections
against antigravity. A number of intriguing and fundamental, open theoretical and
experimental problems of “the new physics of antimatter” are pointed out.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the time of Dirac’s prediction of antiparticles and their detection by Anderson (see [1]
for historical accounts ), the theory of antimatter has been essentially developed at the level
of second quantization.

This occurrence has created an unbalance between the theories of matter and antimatter
at the classical and ﬁrst quantization levels, as well as a number of shortcomings, such as

the inability for the classical theory of antimatter to have a quantized formulation which is
the correct charge (or PTC) conjugate of that of matter.

In an attempt to initiate the scientiﬁc process toward the future resolution of the above
problematic aspects, this author proposed in 1985 [2] a new anti-isomorphic image of con-
ventional mathematics charactered by the map of the conventional unit

+ 1

called for certain technical reasons isodual map, or isoduality.

It should be noted that the change of the basic unit implies a simple, yet unique and non-
trivial change of the totality of conventional mathematics, including: numbers and angles;
functions and transforms; vector and metric spaces; algebras and geometries; etc.

In 1991 this author [3] showed that the above isodual mathematics, since it is an anti-
isomorphic image of the mathematics of matter, provides a novel classical representation of
antimatter.

The proof that isoduality on a Hilbert space is equivalent to charge conjugation ﬁrst
appeared in paper [4] of 1994. A comprehensive operator treatment subsequently appeared
in monographs [5].

The prediction that isoduality implies antigravity (deﬁned as the reversal of the sign
of the curvature tensor) for massive antipaticles in the ﬁeld of matter was submitted in
paper[6], which also included the proposal for its experimental veriﬁcation via the use of a
low energy (eV) positron beam in horizontal ﬂight in a suitable vacuum tube. The latter
experimental proposal was subsequently studied by Mills [7].

This note is devoted to a study of the spectroscopy of antimatter via the isodual char-
acterization of the light emitted by the antihydrogen atom [8]. In particular, we show that
isoduality predicts that antimatter emits a new light here called isodual light which can be
solely diﬀerentiated from the conventional light via gravitational interactions.

In the events additional theoretical and experimental studies conﬁrm the above hypoth-
esis, isoduality would therefore permit the future experimental measures whether far away
galaxies and quasars are made-up of matter or of antimatter.

A more comprehensive analysis is presented in memoir [9], which also includes the study
of isodual theories of antimatter at the more general isotopic and isogravitational levels.
Ref.[9] also shows that know objections against antigravity are inapplicable to (and not
“violated” by) the isodual theory of antimatter, because the former are (tacitly) constructed
on conventional mathematics, while the latter is formulated on a novel mathematics based
on a new negative unit.

After reviewing the mathematical foundations and the main predictions of the isodual
theory, in this note we identify a number of rather fundamental, open, theoretical and
experimental problems of the emerging “new physics of antimatter”.

2 ISODUAL MATHEMATICS

Our fundamental assumption is that of antimatter is that it is represented by the new isodual
mathematics which is the anti-isomorphic image of conventional mathematics under map (1).

Since the latter mathematics is still vastly unknown (in both mathematical and physical
circles), it appears recommendable to outline in this section the main notions in order to
render understandable the physical analysis of the next section.

The above property characterizes a new invariance which has remained undetected since
Hilbert’s conception. Note, however, that, as it is the case for the preceding novel invariance
of the Minkowski line element, the discovery of new laws (9) and (24) required the prior
identiﬁcation of new numbers, the isodual numbers.

The theory of linear operators on a Hilbert space admits a simple, yet signiﬁcant isodu-

ality (see [5]) of which we can only mention for brevity the isodual unitary law

Functional analysis also admits a simple, yet signiﬁcant isoduality which we cannot review
for brevity [loc.cit.]. The non initiated reader should be alerted that, to avoid insidious
inconsistencies, the totality of conventional mathematical quantities, notions and operations
must be subjected to isoduality, e.g.: angles and related trigonometric functions must be
isodual; conventional and special functions and transforms must be isodual; etc. [5].

We ﬁnally recall that the isodual mathematics of this section admits three sequential
generalizations called isotopic, genotopic and hyperstructural which we cannot review here
for brevity [9, 11].

3 ISODUAL THEORY OF ANTIMATTER

The central assumptions of this note are [3]:

1) matter is represented by conventional mathematics, including numbers, spaces, alge-

bras, etc., based on the conventional positive unit +1; while

2) antimatter is represented by the isodual mathematics of the preceding section, including
1.
isodual numbers, isodual spaces, isodual algebras, etc, based on the isodual unit

−

The above representations of matter and antimatter are then interconnected by the iso-

dual map (1) which is bi-injective and anti-isomorphic, as desired.

In this way, isoduality permits, apparently for the ﬁrst time, a representation of antimat-
ter at all levels, beginning at classical level and then continuing at levels of ﬁrst and second
quantization in which it becomes equivalent to charge conjugation [4, 9].

−

By recalling that the isodual norm is negative deﬁnite, Eq. (7), an important conse-
quence is that all physical characteristics which are positive for matter become negative for
antimatter. The above occurrence is familiar with the charge q whose change of sign in
qd =
the transition from particles to antiparticles is re-interpreted as isoduality, q
q.
−
Jointly, however, isoduality requires that the mass of antiparticles is negative, md =
m,
−
their energy is negative, Ed =
E, etc. Finally, isoduality requires that antiparticles more
backward in time, td =

t, as originated conceived [1].

→

−

One should note that the conventional positive values for particles m > 0, E > 0, t > 0,
etc., are referred to corresponding positive units, while the negative values for antiparticles,
md < 0, Ed < 0, td < 0, etc., are referred to negative units of mass, energy, time, etc. This
implies the full equivalence of the two representations and removes the traditional objections
against negative physical characteristics.

In fact, isoduality removes the historical reason that forced Dirac to invent the “hole
theory” [1], which subsequently restricted the study of antimatter at the level of second
quantization. We are here referring to the fact that the negative energy solutions of Dirac’s
equation behave unphysically when (tacitly) referred to positive units, but they behave in a
fully physical way when referred to negative units [4, 9].

The isodual theory of antimatter begins at the primitive Newtonian level so as to achieve
a complete equivalence of treatments with matter. The basic carrier space is the isodual
space

Sd(td, rd, vd) = Ed(td, Rd)

d Ed(rd, δd, Rd)

It is easy to see that the above theory represents correctly all Newtonian Coulomb in-
teractions. In fact, the theory recovers the repulsive Coulomb force between two charges q1
r > 0; it recovers the repulsive force
and q2 of equal sign of matter, F = k
q2/r

The above predictions are conﬁrmed at all subsequent classical levels, including the rep-
resentation of antimatter on isodual Riemannian spaces, which yields the characterization
of antigravity for matter–antimatter systems via the reversal of the sign of the curvature
tensor (see [5, 9] for brevity). In diﬀerent terms, even thogh antimatter-antimatter systems
are attractive as the ordinary matter-matter ones, the gravitational ﬁelds of matter and of
antimatter are diﬀerent. Thus, gravity can tell whether it is made up of matter or antimatter.
The next level of study is that via the isodual analytic mechanics [11], which is character-
ized by the isodual Lagrange equations (here omitted for brevity), and the isodual Hamilton

Isodual techniques have therefore permitted the identiﬁcation of a hitherto unknown im-

is characterized by [5]:

It is evident that the map from quantum mechanics to its isodual is bi–injective and

anti-isomorphic, as desired and as occurring at all preceding levels.

Note in particular that the new Hilbert space invariance law (24) assures that all physical
laws which hold for particles also hold for antiparticles, as conﬁrmed by the equivalence
between charge conjugation and isoduality.

It should be noted that charge conjugation is (bi-injective and) homomorphic because
spaces are mapped into themselves. On the contrary, isoduality is (bi-injective and) anti-
isomorphic because spaces are mapped into new ones, the isodual spaces, which are coexis-
tent, yet physically distinct from conventional spaces. The latter occurrence will soon appear
crucial for the main results of this note.

Intriguingly, isodual quantum mechanics recovers the known electromagnetic and weak
phemenology of antiparticles [5, 9], thus providing suﬃcient credibility for further studies. In

9

fact, the isodual operator theory merely provides a re-interpretation of existing phenomeno-
logical knowledge, as the reader is encouraged to verify, e.g., for the quantum Coulomb
interactions.

It should be also noted that the above results are reached for antiparticles in ﬁrst quanti-
zation, because second quantization is done for exactly the same reasons used for particles, no
more and no less, owing to the complete parallelism of the theories for matter and antimatter
at all levels.

Our relativistic theory of antimatter also begins at the classical level and it is based on a
new image of the special relativity called by this author the isodual special relativity [3, 5, 9].
The latter theory is based on the isodual Minkowski space M d(xd, ηd, Rd) with basic isodual
unit of space and time (also in dimensional form) I d =

Diag(1, 1, 1, 1, ).

The fundamental symmetry is the isodual Poincar´e symmetry P d(3.1) = Ld(3.1)

It is instructive to verify that transforms (35) are the negative version of the conventional

which has remained unknown throughout this century because of the prior need of the isodual
numbers.

It is an instructive exercise for the interested reader to see that the isodual special rela-

tivity recovers all known classical electromagnetic phenomenology for antiparticles [5, 9].

The isodual theory of antimatter sees its best expression at the level of isodual relativistic
quantum mechanics [5, 9], which is given by a simple isoduality of the conventional theory
here omitted for brevity.

We merely point out that negative units and related isodual theory appear in the very

It should be indicated that the latter re-interpretation (which has also escaped atten-
tion thoughout this century) is necessary for consistency. In fact, the conventional gamma

where Φ(x) is now two-dimensional.

Note that the above equations: remove the need of second quantization; eliminate the
need of charge conjugation because the antiparticle is represented by σd, I d, Φd; and re-
store the correct representation of spin 1/2 via the conventional two-dimensional regular
representation of SU(2), rather than the current use of a four-dimensional γ-representation.
We are now equipped to address the main objective of this note, a study of the anti-

hydrogen atom and its spectroscopy.

For this purpose we restrict our analysis to massive particles deﬁned as irreducible unitary
representations of the Poincar´e symmetry
(3.1). This essentially restricts the analysis to
the electron e and the proton p, both considered as elementary, due to certain ambiguities
for composite hadrons indicated in App.A.

P

We then introduce the notion of massive isodual particles as irreducible unitary represen-
d(3.1). This again restricts the analysis to the

tations of the isodual Poincar´e symmetry
isodual electron ed and isodual proton pd.

P

At this point we should indicate the diﬀerences between “antiparticles” and “isodual par-
ticles”. In ﬁrst approximation, these two notions can be identiﬁed owing to the equivalence
of charge conjugation and isoduality. However, at a deeper inspection, antiparticles and
isodual particles result to be diﬀerent on a number of grounds, such as:

1. Isoduality is broder than the PTC symmetry because, in addition to reversing space-
q (C), it

x (PT) and conjugating the charge q

xd =

qd =

time coordinates x
also reverses the sign of the background units.

→

−

→

−

2. Antiparticles are deﬁned in our own space-time, while isodual particles are deﬁned in

a new space-time which is physically diﬀerent than our own.

11

3. Antiparticles have positive mass, energy, (magnitude of) spin, etc., and move forward
in time, while isodual particles have negative mass, energy, (magnitude of) spin, etc.
and move backward in time.

Next, we consider the bound states of the above elementary particles which are given
by: the hydrogen atom A = (p, e)QM ; the isodual hydrogen atom Ad = (pd, ed)IQM ; and the
positronium P = (e, ed)QM = (ed, e)IQM , where QM (IQM) stands for Quantum Mechanics
(Isodual Quantum Mechanics).

It is evident that the hydrogen atom is characterized by the familiar Schr¨odinger’s equa-

tion in the Coulomb spectrum En on the Hilbert space

The isodual hydrogen atom is then characterized by the isodual image on

changes e

with a conjugate expression in isodual space-time.

As indicated earlier, the isodual theory recovers the available information on electromag-
netic (and weak) interactions of antiparticles. No novelty is therefore expected along these
lines in regard to the antihydrogen atom and the positronium.

However, the isodual theory has the following novel predictions for gravitational interac-

tions [6, 9]:

PREDICTION I: Massive stable isodual particles and their bound stated (such
as the isodual hydrogen atom) experience antigravity in the ﬁeld of matter and
ordinary gravity in the ﬁeld of antimatter.

PREDICTION II: Bound states of massive stable particles and their isoduals
(such as the positronium) experience ordinary gravity in both ﬁelds of matter and
antimatter.

We now remain with the central open problem raised in this note: Does antimatter emit

a new light diﬀerent than that emitted by ordinary matter?

12

(43)

(44)

The answer provided by the isodual theory is in the aﬃrmative. Recall that the photon
γ emitted by the hydrogen atom has positive energy and time according to the familiar
plane-waves characterization on M(x, η, R) with unit I = Diag(1, 1, 1, 1)

Ψ(t, r) = A

ei×(k×r−E×t).

×

The isodual hydrogen atom has negative energy and time. As such, it is predicted to
emit photons with the same characteristics, here called isodual photon and characterized by
the isoduality

×

−

now deﬁned on M d(xd, ηd, Rd) with isodual unit I d =

Diag(1, 1, 1, 1).

−

It is easy to see that the isodual photon is characterized by the isodual special relativity
1, massless, irreducible, isodual unitary representation of P d(3.1), the

via the spin 1d =
isodual neutrinos being the corresponding representation for spin 1
2

It should be recalled again that the isodual particle γd behaves exactly like the ordinary
photon γ under all electromagnetic and weak interactions. Moreover, massive particles and
their isoduals do annihilate into photons, but photons and their isoduals cannot annihilate.
The sole known possibility to distinguish photons from their isoduals is via gravitational
interactions. We reach in this way the following:

d =

1
2 .

−

PREDICTION III: The isodual photon experiences antigravity in the ﬁeld of mat-
ter and gravity in the ﬁeld of antimatter.

If conﬁrmed by future theoretical and experimental studies, the above prediction would
permit to ascertain whether a far away galaxy or quasar is made up of matter or antimatter
by measuring whether its light is attracted or repelled by the gravitational ﬁeld of matter.
In principle, the above hypothesis can be experimentally tested in contemporary astro-
physics, provided that care is exercised in the interpretation of the results.
In fact, the
gravitational attraction of light emitted from a very distant galaxy by a closer galaxy is
not evidence that they are made up of matter, because both galaxies can be made-up of
antimatter.

However, the astrophysical measure of gravitational repulsion of light under the above
conditions would be an experimental conﬁrmation of our isodual theory of antimatter, al-
though we would not be in a position of identifying which of the two galaxies is made-up of
matter and which is made up of antimatter.

The resolution of the latter issues will be possible when the technology on the gravita-
tional deﬂection of light permits the measure of light deﬂected by ﬁelds we are sure to be
made-up of matter, such as a near-by planet or the Sun.

It should be indicated that the deﬂection of light originating from far away galaxies or
quasars has indeed been measured and in all cases it has shown to be attracted by matter.
Therefore, no light repelled by matter (or isodual light) has been detected until now to our
best knowledge.

13

In summary, the “new physics of antimatter” will remain unsettled until we have ﬁnal
experimental results on the behavior in the gravitational ﬁeld of matter of: isodual photons,
isodual electrons (positions), isodual proton (antiproton), positronium, and isodual (anti)
hydrogen atom.

Note that the availability of several of the above experimental resolutions, but not that
for the positronium will still leave the theory of antimatter essentially unsettled because of
the several conceivable alternatives which remain possible.

In closing we should point out that, by no means, all possible open questions related to

the new isodual theory of antimatter can be resolved in this introductory note.

Among a virtually endless number of aspects to be studied, we mention the need for the
isodual re-interpretation of second quantization which can be achieved via the separation of
retarded and advanced solutions as belonging to the Minkowski space and its isodual, re-
spectively, and the re-interpretation of the former (latter) as characterizing particles (isodual
particles).

Preliminary (unpublished) studies have indicated that the above re-interpretation essen-
tially leaves unchanged the numerical results for electromagnetic and weak interactions all
the way to the isodual re-interpretation of Feynman diagrams, although this expectation
must evidently be conﬁrmed by speciﬁc studies.

However, the re-interpretation implies signiﬁcant changes, e.g., the study whether a given
photon is indeed such or it is an isodual photon. As an example, the isodual interpretation
of the two-photon decay of the positronium requires the re-formulation

P os. = (e, ed)IQM →
A similar result is expected for other decays, e.g., π0

γ + γd.

γ+γd under the condition that the
π0 is also a bound state of a particle its antiparticle. We should recall that no conservation
law of matter and, independently, of antimatter, is possible because of their interconnection
via ﬁnite transition probabilities established beginning with Dirac’s equation. Therefore,
the isodual theory also admits the three-body decays of the positronium into γ + γ + γd or
γ + γd + γd, e.g., when the total energy of the two γ’s (of the two γd’s) of the three-body
decay is equal to the energy of the γ (of the γd) of the two-body decay.

→

(45)

Along similar lines, under suﬃcient amounts of energy, particle-antiparticle systems can
also decay for the isodual theory into one single photon or one single isodual photon. Similar
situations permitted by the lack of conservation of matter and, separately, of antimatter,
also occur for the decay of pions and in other interactions.

Note that there is no new law of conservation of matter and, separately, of antimatter,
because of the ﬁnite transition probability among them established beginning with Dirac’s
equation. The only possible conservation laws are the conventional ones is our space time
and, separately,their isoduals for antimatter.

In addition to the isodual studies in second quantization, it is necessary to conduct
further studies on the interior gravitational problem of matter and of antimatter via the
isotopic methods [5, 9].

In fact the latter studies have provided the strongest avaible evidence on the existence of
antigravity originating from the identiﬁcation (rather than the “uniﬁcation”) of the (exterior)
gravitational ﬁeld with the electromagnetic ﬁeld originating the mass considered [13]. It is
evident that such identiﬁcation implies the equivalence of the two phenomenologies, that is,

14

gravitation is expected to have both attraction and repulsion in the same way as occurring
for electromagnetism.

The above argument is so forceful that the experimental establishment of the lack of ex-
istence of antigravity may ultimately imply the need to re-write particle physics, beginning
with the electron, into a form in which the mass does not possess an appreciable electro-
magnetic origin, or it may imply the lack of physical validity of the mathematical notion of
isoduality.

Finally, additional studies are needed on the classical and quantum isotopic representa-
tion of gravity and its isodual [9], because these studies contain all the preceding ones plus
the inclusion of gravitation which is embedded in the unit for matter and in the isodual unit
for antimatter.

Preliminary (unpublished) studies have indicated that the latter approach conﬁrm the
results of this note, while permitting further advances at the isooperator gravitational level,
e.g., an axiomatically consistent formulation of the PTC theorem inclusive of gravitation.

We ﬁnally note that the possible lack of existence of antigravity for the isudual photon will
not invalidate the isodual theory, because it will only imply the isoselfduality of the photon,
that is, presence in the photon of both retarded and advanced solutions, which would remain
separated for massive particles. Thus, antigravity may exists for massive particles without
necessarily existing for light.

Interested readers are encouraged to identify possible theoretical arguments against anti-
gravity for light emitted by antimatter, with the clear understanding that the ﬁnal scientiﬁc
resolution one way or the other can only be the experimental one.

APPENDIX A:

Gravitational problematic aspects of quark theories.

The “new physics of antimatter” is expected to have an impact on all of elementary
particle physics, because it focuses the attention on novel gravitational, rather than familiar
electroweak aspects.

An illustration is given by a necessary reformulation of contemporary quark theories. In
fact, gravitation is solely deﬁned in our space-time, while quarks are solely deﬁned in the
mathematical, unitary, internal space, with no interconnection being possible due to the
O’Rafeirtaigh theorem.

It necessarily follows that all particles made-up of quarks cannot have any gravitation at

all, which is grossly contrary to experimental evidence.

It should be indicated that O’Raifeartaigh’s theorem has been superseded by graded Lie
algebras and related supersymmetries, in which case a connection between space-time and
internal symmetries is possible. However, the validity of such interconnection would require
the prior establishment of the physical validity of supersymmetries and the existence of their

15

predicted new particles. Irrespective of that, a correct formulation of the gravity of quarks
within this latter setting is faced with serious technical problems and it has not been achieved
until now, to our best knowledge.

The above conclusion is conﬁrmed by the well known fact that quarks cannot be char-
acterized by irreducible representations of the Poincar´e group, that is, quark masses do not
exist in our space-time, and are mere parameters in unitary spaces.

Even assuming that the above fundamental problem is somewhat resolved via hitherto
unknown manipulations, additional equally fundamental problems exist in the construction
of a quark theory of antimatter, because it does not yield in general an anti-isomorphic image
of the phenomenology of matter.

When including the additional, well known problematic aspects of quark theories (e.g.,
the vexing problem of conﬁnement which is not permitted by the uncertainty principle), a
structural revision of contemporary quark theories becomes beyond credible doubts.

The only resolution of the current scientiﬁc impass known to this author is that advocated
since 1981, quarks cannot be elementary particles [14], as apparently conﬁrmed by recent
experiments at Fermi-lab [15].

In fact, the compositeness of quarks would permit their construction as suitable bound
states of physical massive particles existing in our space-time, in which case (only) there
would be the regaining of the physical behavior under gravity.

The following aspects should however be clearly stated to separate science from ﬁction.
First, the above new generation of quark theories requires the abandonment of the conven-
tional Poincar´e symmetry P (3.1) in favor of a nonlinear, nonlocal-integral and non canonical
P (3.1) [16]. In fact, a consistent con-
generalization, e.g., the isopoincar´e-symmetry
struction of composite quarks inside hadron requires the necessary alteration of the intrinsic
P
characteristics of ordinary particles which is prohibited by P (3.1) but rather natural for
(3.1) [16] and related methodology [5].

P (3.1)

≈

b

The use of the q

, k

b
and quantum deformations of should be excluded because aﬄicted

by excessive problems of physical consistency (which are absent for isotopies), such as [5]:

−

−

1) Lack of invariance of the basic unit with consequential inapplicability to actual mea-

surements;

2) Lack of preservation of Hermiticity in time with consequential lack of observables;

3) Lack of invariant special functions (because, e.g., the number q becomes an operator

under the time evolution).

4) Lack of uniqueness and invariance of physical laws;

5) Loss of Eistein’s axioms; etc.

Second, the real constituents of hadrons are expected to be the quark constituents and
not the quarks themselves [14]. This new perspective removes altogether the need for con-
ﬁnement. As a matter of fact, the hadronic constituents are expected to be produced free
and actually identiﬁed in the massive particles produced in the spontaneous decays with the
lowest mode [16].

16

The latter particles become conceivable as constituents because of the novel renormal-
izations of their intrinsic characteristics which are permitted by internal nonlagrangian and
nonhamiltonian eﬀects.

Third, the primary physical meaning of unitary theories and related methodologies
(Poincar´e symmetry, SU(3) symmetry, relativistic quantum mechanics, etc.) is their his-
torical one: having achieved the ﬁnal classiﬁcation of hadrons into families and the ﬁnal
understanding of the related exterior phenomenology.

In much of the way as it occurred for the atoms in the transition from the Mendeleev
classiﬁcation into families to the diﬀerent problem of the structure of the individual atoms,
the transition from the unitary classiﬁcation of hadrons into families to the diﬀerent problem
of the structure of the individual hadrons, is expected to require a nonlinear, nonlocal-integral
and nonpotential-nonhamiltonian generalization of relativistic quantum mechanics, e.g., of
the isotopic axion-preserving type of ref.s [5, 14, 16].

We should not forget that hadrons are not ideal spheres with points in them, but are
instead some of the densest objects measured in laboratory by mankind in which the con-
stituence are in a state of total mutual penetration of the wavepackets. It is an easy predic-
tion that, even though of clear preliminary physical value, the use for the latter conditions
of theories which are linear, local-diﬀerential and Lagrangian-Hamiltonian will not resist the
test of time.

The author would be grateful to colleagues who care to bring to his attention any credible
alternative to the above lines [5, 14], that is, a new generation of theories with composite
quarks which:

1) admit physical constituents unambiguously deﬁned in our space-time;

2) represent without ambiguities the gravitational behavior of matter and antimatter; and

3) are based on the exact validity of the Poincar´e-symmetry, quantum mechanics and all

that.

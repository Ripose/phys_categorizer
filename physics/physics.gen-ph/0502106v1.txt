Abstract

In recent years Quantum Superstrings and Quantum Gravity ap-
proaches have come to rely on non diﬀerenciable spacetime manifolds.
These throw up a noncommutative spacetime geometry and we con-
sider the origin of mass and a related modiﬁcation of the Dirac equa-
tion in this context. This also throws some light on gravitation itself.

1 Origin of Mass

In an earlier communication [1] it was shown that the eﬀect of noncom-
mutative geometry in breaking the symmetry in non-Abelian gauge theory
leads to a term identical to the Higgs boson generating term. Indeed over
the past few years various Quantum Gravity schemes as also string theo-
retic approaches are converging to the fact that spacetime is not smooth,
but rather there is a minimum cut oﬀ which leads to a noncommutative ge-
ometry [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. On the other hand it has been argued by the
author that inertial mass is a result of non local Quantum amplitudes at the
Compton scale [9, 10]. We will now reconcile both these concepts and show
that the mass term appears as a result of the noncommutativity of spacetime.
Our starting point is the Dirac equation (using natural units c = 1 = ¯h),

(γµpµ) ψ = 0

where ~

term which leads to the massless Klein-Gordon or D’Alembertian operator.
The second term is well known (Cf.ref.[11]) - in a non relativistic approxima-
tion with a small external magnetic ﬁeld that is switched on, this term leads
to a spin orbit coupling. It is the third and last term that is the extra eﬀect
due to the noncommutative character of spacetime, that is due to the fact

We identify this extra term with the mass term, viz.,

Bµν = [pµ, pν]

= 0

γıγ◦Bı◦ = m2

We will justify this identiﬁcation in a moment. With this identiﬁcation, and
in the absence of an external magnetic ﬁeld, in which case the second term
in (2) disappears, (2) goes over to the Klein-Gordon equation for a massive
particle.
Infact it has already been discussed in detail (Cf.ref.[5, 12, ?] that in the
above noncommutative case, (3),

Bµν = pµpν −

pνpµ = ∂µ∂ν −
where Fµν is the usual electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor. (The deep relation of
(5) with the Weyl gauge invariant electromagnetic potential has also been
discussed in detail in the above references). Because of (5) and because of
the fact that,

∂ν∂µ = eFµν

(5)

γıγ◦ = αı

where ~α denotes the velocity operator, at the Compton wavelength where
momentum is m(= mc), the extra term becomes

in agreement with (4) due to the deﬁnition of the Compton length as the
electron radius viz.,

The massive Klein-Gordon equation then, in the usual formulation leads back
to the Dirac equation (1) but this time with the usual mass term.

2 An Ultra High Energy Dirac Equation

As noted over the past few years, diﬀerent approaches towards Quantum
Gravity are leading to the conclusion that spacetime is not a smooth contin-
uum but rather, has a discrete structure. Indeed as ’t Hooft put it [2, 6], “It
is somewhat puzzling to the present author why the lattice structure of space
and time had escaped attention from other investigators up till now...”. Such
a discrete structure would imply a violation of Lorentz symmetry at ultra
high energies, as noted by the author himself, Glashow, Coleman and several
others [13].
Indeed some of this work has been motivated by the possibility that such a
violation has already been observed in a few cases in a study of ultra high
energy cosmic rays (Cf.ref.[13] and several references therein). This has the
consequence that the Klein-Gordon equation gets modiﬁed as noted in [13].
We will now consider the modiﬁcation in the Dirac equation and brieﬂy ex-
amine its consequences.
Once we consider a discrete spacetime structure, the energy momentum re-
lation, as noted, gets modiﬁed [10, 14] and we have in units c = 1 = ¯h,

l being a minimum length interval, which could be the Planck length or more
generally the Compton length. Let us now consider the Dirac equation

If (9), as in the usual theory, has to represent (6), then we require that the
matrix β satisfy

Γβ + βΓ = 0,

β2 = 1

From the properties of the Dirac matrices [15] it follows that (10) is satisﬁed
if

β = γ5

Using (11) in (8), the modiﬁed Dirac equation ﬁnally becomes

Owing to the fact that we have [15]

ψ = 0

It follows that the modiﬁed Dirac equation (12) is not invariant under re-
ﬂections. This is a result which is to be expected because the correction to
the usual energy momentum relation, as shown in (6) arises when l is of the

order of the Compton wavelength. The usual Dirac four spinor

as

is known has the so called positive energy (or large) components Θ and the
negative energy (or small) components χ. However as is well known, when
we approach the Compton wavelength, that is as

the roles are reversed and it is the χ components which predominate. More-
over the χ two spinor behaves under reﬂection as [15]

χ

→ −
We can also see that due to the modiﬁed Dirac equation (??), there is no
additional eﬀect on the anomalous gyromagnetic ratio. This is because, in
the usual equation from which the magnetic moment is determined [16] viz.,

However the expression (14) vanishes by the property of the Dirac matrices.
It has already been argued in detail that [9, 10] as we approach the Comp-
ton wavelength, the Dirac equation describes the quark with the fractional
charge and handedness. Our above derivation and conclusioin is pleasingly
in agreement with this result.

3 Gravitation

We now come to a slightly diﬀerent problem– that of Gravitation. Gravita-
tion has deﬁed a uniﬁcation with electromagnetism for nearly nine decades
now. In the context of Quantum Field Theory, the fact that the graviton
is a spin 2 particle makes it diﬃcult for a description in terms of gauge
ﬁeld theory. As Witten put it [7] “The existence of gravity clashes with our
description of the rest of physics by quantum ﬁelds.” On the other hand
Wolfgang Pauli went so far as to mention that we must not try to put to-
gether what God had intended to be separate. However, it has been shown
that in the context of sections 1 and 2, it is still possible to eﬀect a uniﬁed
description of Gravitation and Electromagnetism [4, 6, 10, 12]. In a slightly
diﬀerent context, we consider below a simpliﬁed model which shows up grav-
itation as a residual electrical eﬀect.
Our starting point is the well known fact that the universe at large is electri-
cally neutral, in the sense that it is dominated by atoms in which the positive

5

and negative electric charges neutralise each other. This is the reason why
electric charges have a marginal role in the large scale universe, the much
weaker gravitation being the predominant force.
With this background let us consider the following simple model of an elec-
trically neutral atom which nevertheless has a dipole eﬀect. Infact as is well
known from elementary electrostatics the potential energy at a distance r
due to the dipole is given by

∼

∼

10−8cm

103l = βl, e being the electric charge of the
where µ = eL, L
electron for simplicity and l being the electron Compton wavelength. (There
is a factor cosΘ with µ, but on an integration over all directions, this becomes
an irrelevant constant factor 4π.)
Due to (15), the potential energy of a proton p (which approximates an atom
in terms of mass) at the distance r (much greater than L) is given by

1080 atoms in the universe, the net potential energy of a

In (17) we use the fact that the predominant eﬀect comes from the distant
atoms which are at a distance
We now use the well known Eddington formula,

r, the radius of the universe.

r being of the order of the dimension of the universe. (Incidentally while
(18) has been known as an empirical relation for nearly a century now, it can
actually be deduced from theory [17, 18, 10]). If we introduce (18) in (17)
we get, as the energy E of the proton under consideration

Let us now consider the gravitational potential energy E′ of the proton p due
to all the other N atoms in the universe. This is given by

where m is the proton mass and M is the mass of the universe.
Comparing (19) and (20), not only is E equal to E′, but remembering that
M = Nm, we get

Equation (21) has been a well known relatioin for many decades [19]. It gives
the ratio of the electromagnetic and gravitational coupling constants.
We can now argue that the signiﬁcance of (21) and the equality of (19) and
(20) is the following: The gravitational energy itself is a manifestation of the
residual dipole eﬀect of the electric charges which constitute the atoms of the
universe. Indeed, it has been shown [17, 10] that

(21)

(22)

And it was argued [20, 6] that (22) is symptomatic of the fact that gravitation,
unlike electromagnetism is a distributional eﬀect, distributed over the N
particles of the universe. Our conclusion in (21) is pleasingly in agreement
with this conclusion.

Direction Adaptation Nature of Coulomb’s Force and Gravitational Force in
4-Dimensional Space-time

It was found that the Coulomb’s force and gravitational force on a particle always act in the
direction perpendicular to the 4-velocity of the particle in 4-dimensional space-time, rather than
along the line joining a couple of particles. This inference is obviously supported from the fact that
the magnitude of the 4-velocity is kept constant.
It indicates there is a new nature here named
as direction adaptation nature. This formulation has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on who to teach physics
taday, for example, we always say to students that the sun’s gravitational force directs at the sun,
but this sentence is uncorrect according to the direction adaptation nature of gravitational force.

03.50.De, 04.20.Cv, 03.30.+p

In the world, almost every young people was educated to know that the Coulomb’s force and gravitational force

act along the line linking a couple of particles. But this statements contradicts to the relativity theory.

In an inertial Cartesian coordinate system S : (x1, x2, x3, x4 = ict), the 4-velocity u of a particle has components

(uµ, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4 ) deﬁned as in the relativity theory [1], the magnitude of the 4-velocity u is given by

= √uµuµ =

u
|

|

p−

c2 = ic

where since the reference frame S is a Cartesian coordinate system whose axes are orthogonal to one another, there
is no distinction between covariant and contravariant components, only subscripts need be used. Here and below,
summation over twice repeated indices is implied in all case, Greek indices will take on the values 1,2,3,4. The above
equation stands, any force can never change u in the magnitude but can change u in the direction. We therefore
conclude that the Coulomb’s force and gravitational force on a particle always act in the direction perpendicular to
the 4-velocity of the particle in the 4-dimensional space-time, rather than along the line joining a couple of particles.
Alternatively, any 4-force f satisfy the following perpendicular relation

In present paper, Eq.(2) has been elevated to an essential requirement for deﬁnition of any force, which bring out

many new aspects for the Coulomb’s force and gravitational force.

Suppose that two charged particle q and q′ locate at the positions (x1, x2, x3, x4) and (x′

4) in the Cartesian
coordinate system S and move at 4-velocities u and u′ respectively, as shown in Fig.1. Two characters for the
Coulomb’s force must be considered. The ﬁrst, because electromagnetic interaction occurs through photon exchange
process, there is a retardation condition, so that the Coulomb’s force on q can only happen at time t = t′ + (r/c) ,
where r is the spatial distance of the two particles. The second, the Coulomb’s force is perpendicular to the velocity
direction of q, as illustrated in Fig.1. Like a centripetal force, the Coulomb’s force f on q should make an attempt
to rotate itself about its path center, the force f should lie in the plane of u′ and X, in agreement with the classical
Coulomb’s formula for two rest particles, so we can write it as

The Eq.(19) and (20) are known as the Maxwell’s equations. For continuous media, they stand as well as.

The above formalism clearly show that the Maxwell’s equations can been derived from the classical Coulomb’s force
and the perpendicular relation of force and velocity in an axiomatic manner. Specially, Eq.(5) directly accounts for
the geometrical meanings of the curl of vector potential.

The above formalism has a signiﬁcance on guiding who to develope the gravitational theory which exists many

versions, specially in the scope of the general relativity in a sense.

In analogy with the modiﬁed Coulomb’s force of Eq.(10), we directly suggest a modiﬁed universal gravitational

force as

for a couple of particles with masses m and m′ respectively. Comparing with the statements about the Coulomb’s
force and gravitational force in the most textbooks, the perpendicular relation of force and velocity is named here as
direction adaptation nature of force.

It follows from Eq.(21) that we can predict there are gravitational radiation and magnetic-like components for the
gravitational force. Obviously, if the Newton’s law of universal gravitation and the direction adaptation nature of
force both are basic axioms, the predicted eﬀects will exist. Particularly, the magnetic-like components will act as a
key role in the geophysics. Because of lacking experimental data to the predicted eﬀects in a sense, in the following
our interest turns to certain nonlinear eﬀects of photon ﬂying [4] concerning with the direction adaptation nature.

We begin by discussing the motion of a single photon. The path in Fig.2 is a graph of the photon’s coordinate x1
plotted as a function of time ict. The photon is emitted at point P1 and received at point P2, two reference frames
S and S′ are ﬁxed at the two points respectively, and corrected their x1-axes in the same direction according to the
photon traveling direction. To note that c = dx1/dt, u makes an angle of 45 degree with the x1-axis at P1. The
gravitational force acts like a centripetal force deﬂecting u to the center of the path, so the 4-velocity of the photon
has rotated an angle θ after its travel from P1 to P2 through the action of the gravitational force. Then there are
coordinate transformations for the two reference frames S and S′, given by

For calculating the work done by the gravitational force from P1 to P2, we establish a xg-axis lying along the
gravitational direction, Newton’s second law of motion is modiﬁed in terms of the angle θ to

gives the spectral shift for the photon. If the photon moves from the place of lower gravitational potential to the
higher, then Φ < 0, there is the spectral red shift for the photon.

For a particle moving under the Newtonian gravitational attraction of a spherical object of mass M situated at the

origin of the reference polar coordinate frame S : (r, ϕ, x4 = ict), its orbit is given by

where notations consist with the convention [1]. In the case of planet with the smaller speed comparing to the speed
of light, one never needs to solve its relativistic dynamical equation, the precision of Eq.(27) is enough for describing
the motion of the particle (planet).

For an observer at the inﬁnite distance point from the particle, the 4-velocity of photons before arriving at the
observer have rotated an angle θ due to the eﬀect of the gravitational ﬁeld in our view of points. The bent rays form
an image of the particle orbit at the lower location in Fig.3. The reference coordinate system S′ : (x′
4 = ict′)
ﬁxed at the observer is depicted in Fig.3 with the dot lines as well as. If the position of the particle in S′ is measured
with three coordinates: ρ, ϕ, t′′, where ρ is the distance from the center O′ to the image particle, t′′ is the time of the
center O′ in S′. Thus (ρ, ϕ, t′′ ) consists of an abstract coordinate system S′′, in which OO′ is perpendicular to O′P ′
because of the center O′ with coordinates (0, 0, t′′). Then there are coordinate transformations between the S and S′:

It is known as the Schwarzchild metric tensor [1] [2]. We then may expect that all conclusions made for the particle

It is as the same as that in the general relativity [1] [2].

We emphasize that any measurable quantity can to be deﬁned in various space-time, a suitable space-time will be

determined from the agreement in the experiment and the theory.

The path of a photon traveling in an equatorial plane is given by Eq.(33,34). For the photon, Eq.(34) becomes

where set u = 1/ρ. So in its ﬂight past the massive object M of radius R the photon is deﬂected through an angle

in agreement with observations [1] [2].

If there is not the nonlinear eﬀect of photon ﬂying, any straight line in the space-time is of the path of photon.
Since the light is bent in the 4-dimensional space-time for an inﬁnite distance observer, we consequently conclude that
the space will bend due to the gravitational eﬀect mentioned above near a massive object.

The particle at rest has the 4-velocity u = (0, 0, 0, ic) in 4-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The ”rest”
refers to in the space. Considering two rest inertial frames, labeled S and S′, ﬁxed respectively at two rest particles
with their x1-axes lying along the same line. At one moment, the particle of the frame S′ starts into a gravitational
ﬁeld or electromagnetic ﬁeld Φ, and goes out with a classical speed v along the x1-axis. In our view of points, the
4-axis of the frame S′ has rotated an angle θ , because the force deﬂects the 4-velocity of the S′ particle. From
x′
Eq.(25), the angle is given by.

It is noted that the direction adaptation nature stands for any force: strong, electromagnetic, weak and gravitational

interactions, so there are new aspects remained for physics to explore.

In conclusion, it was found that the gravitational force and Coulomb’s force on a particle always act in the direction
perpendicular to the 4-velocity of the particle in 4-dimensional space-time, rather than along the line joining a couple
of particles. This inference is obviously supported from the fact that the magnitude of the 4-velocity is kept constant.
It indicates there is a new nature here named as direction adaptation nature. The Maxwell’s equations can been
derived from the classical Coulomb’s force and the direction adaptation nature of force in an axiomatic manner.
Certain gravitational eﬀects can be explained in terms of the direction adaptation nature of gravitational force for
photon ﬂying.

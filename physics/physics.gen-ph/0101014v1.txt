THE ELUSIVE MONOPOLE

Abstract

In this brief note, we argue that the elusive magnetic monopole
arises due to the strong magnetic eﬀects arising from the non commu-
tative space time structure at small scales. This would also explain
why the monopole has eluded detection even after seventy years.

1 Introduction

Ever since Dirac deduced theoretically the existence of the monopole in 1931,
it has eluded physicists[1]. At the same time the possibility of realising huge
amounts of energy using monopoles has been an exciting prospect. In 1980
when the ﬁftieth Anniversary of the monopole was being commemorated,
Dirac himself expressed his belief that the monopole did not exist[2]. Some
scholars have indeed dismissed the monopole[3, 4], while in a model based
on quantized vortices in the hydrodynamical formulation, the monopole ﬁeld
can be mathematically identiﬁed with the momentum vector[5]. Monopoles
had also been identiﬁed with solitons[6].
In any case, it has been noted that the existence of free monopoles would
lead to an unacceptably high density of the universe[7], which in the light of
latest observations of an ever expanding universe[8, 9] would be diﬃcult to
reconcile.
We will now show that monopoles arise due to a non commutative structure
of space time, and this would also provide an explanation for their being
undetected.

2 The Monopole

The Dirac equation for a spin half particle throws up a complex position
coordinate. Dirac identiﬁed the imaginary part with Zitterbewegung eﬀects
and argued that this would be eliminated once it is realized that in Quantum
Mechanics, space time points are not meaningful and that on the contrary
averages over intervals of the order of the Compton scale have to be taken
to recover meaningful physics[10]. Over the decades the signiﬁcance of such
cut oﬀ space time intervals has been stressed by T.D. Lee and several other
scholars[11, 12, 13, 14]. Indeed with a minimum cut oﬀ length l, it was shown
by Snyder[15] that there would be a non commutative space time structure,
and infact at the Compton scale we would have (Cf. ref.[14])

[x, y] = 0(l2)

(1)

and similar relations.
This feature has been also stressed in recent times by Witten[16], who has
pointed out that conventional Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field The-
ory are based on a Minkowskian or Bosonic space time, where as there is a
Fermionic, non commutative space time structure at smaller scales. This is
given by equations like (1).
We now observe that the non commutative structure given by (1) can be
shown to be associated with a strong magnetic ﬁeld B[17] given by

¯hc
eB

∼ l2

µ = Bl2 ∼ ¯hc
e

Whence we have

(2)

Equation (2) infact deﬁnes the magnetic monopole. This means that the
magnetic monopole is thrown up at the Compton scale or, equivalently for
masses near the Planck mass, the Planck scale, due to the non commutative
or Fermionic space structure.
Interestingly a similar explanation has been shown to hold for Quarks also,
and it was pointed out that this meant that the Quarks would automatically
be conﬁned and would not be observed as free entities[18]. For the same
reason the monopole also would not, in this formulation be observed as a

2

free entity. This could explain why they have eluded detection for some
seventy years now.
Interestingly an equation like (1) shows that there would be a break down
of parity at the Compton scale. This can be easily veriﬁed from the fact
that the bi spinor Dirac wave function has ”positive energy” components θ
and ”negative energy” components χ and that as we approach the Compton
wavelength it is the component χ which predominates, and also exhibits the
opposite parity[19].

Abstract

This paper is directed to the readers who are familiar with the earlier papers by the author
on the topic of mass-energy equivalence. A number of important questions about the total
energy equation H = mv2 and its implications are answered qualitatively. The relationship
between the equation H = mv2 and the 4-vector (Minkowski) representation of Special
Relativity is discussed in detail. Other issues, such as de Broglie’s original formulation of
wave mechanics, are also discussed.

Introduction:

1. Questions and answers:

This paper is a compilation of a number of
important questions received by the author
from several colleagues. It is organized as fol-
lows: Sec.1 contains a rather informal discus-
sion about the implications of the total energy
equation H = mv2 (see ref.[1]), presented in
the form of questions and answers. The most
important question asked was how a total en-
ergy equation such as H = mv2 can possibly
ﬁt with the 4-vector (Minkowski) representa-
tion of special relativity, in which H = mc2
is a cornerstone. This issue is addressed in
detail in Sec.2. Sec.3 discusses some mathe-
matical issues related to the concepts of the
phase velocity and the group velocity, as well
as de Broglie’s original arguments that led to
the development of wave mechanics. In Sec.4,
derivations are presented for a modiﬁed Klein-
Gordon equation and a de Broglie dispersion
relation.

Q1. According to the total energy equation
H = mv2, the rest energy is equal to zero.
How nuclear fusion can be possible without
rest energy? Two fusing particles (e.g., a
deuteron and a triton) usually require little
kinetic energy to start the fusion process, yet
the energy released from fusion is huge!

A. In the fusion process, kinetic energy (usu-
ally on the order of 100Kev) is required to
bring the electrostatic centers of the two fusing
particles to a distance of a few fm apart, where
the strong nuclear force takes over. Once the
strong nuclear force takes over, the two par-
ticles move toward each other very rapidly.
This relative velocity is the important param-
eter. The energy released in the reaction will
be then equal to ∆mv2, not ∆mc2. That is
why a wide distribution of energies is obtained,
rather than the precise quantity ∆mc2. A de-

1

tailed theory of fusion (and of ﬁssion), how-
ever, is probably still a number of years away.
So, the short answer is, nuclear fusion doesn’t
really occur at rest.

Q2. At low energies, the total energy will be
given by the quantity m0v2. Hence, we have an
extra mass-energy term that is equal to 1
2m0v2
(in addition to the usual Newtonian kinetic en-
ergy). Since this energy is variable, it must be
extrinsic to the particle, i.e., it can’t be an in-
trinsic property of the particle. Where does
this extra energy come from?

A: The answer to this question will be the
Vacuum Energy, which was ﬁrst proposed by
Heisenberg and Euler in 1936 and veriﬁed ex-
perimentally 11 years later (see for example
ref.[5] for the latest information on the sub-
ject). The vacuum energy has been proposed
to be of the form

Evac =

¯hω

1
2

What was demonstrated in ref.[1] is that the
term ¯hω is in fact exactly equivalent to the
term m0v2. This explains where the extrinsic
energy 1
2m0v2 comes from. Of course, this also
suggests that the vacuum “oscillations” (when
associated with a particle) are essentially the
same as de Broglie’s matter waves.

Q3. Since H = 0 at rest, then obviously par-
ticle decays cannot occur at rest. But some
decays are actually observed to occur at rest.
How can this be explained?

A. Care must be taken when determining
whether a particle is absolutely at rest or in
motion relative to the reference frame of the
laboratory. For instance, it was indicated[3]
that lepton (e.g. µ±) and π0 decays cannot
occur at rest. On the other hand, decays such

as neutron beta decay and the decay π± → µ±
can occur at rest because the decaying particle
is essentially a quark that is in a state of mo-
tion within the parent meson or nucleon. Nu-
clear ﬁssion can also occur while the nucleus
is at rest due to the phenomenon of oscillation
of the ﬁssion fragments within the nucleus be-
fore the occurrence of ﬁssion. Other reactions
must be interpreted in a similar manner.

Q4. But experiments have shown that muons
(µ±) decay at rest.

A. No.
In experiments such as the famous
experiments of Lederman (see ref.[6]), muons
are stopped in a block of dense material, such
as carbon. It is only “assumed” that the muon
then decays at rest. There is no way to assert
that the muon actually decays while at rest. In
other experiments, where muons are observed
to decay in photographic emulsions, there is
actually conclusive evidence that the muon de-
cays while in motion. Fig.1 below shows a typ-
ical picture of the decay chain π+ → µ+ → e+
in a photographic emulsion. The positive pion
enters at point A in the picture and travels to
point B, where it decays into a muon. The
muon then travels to point C, where it de-
cays into a positron (the positron represents
the track CD). An important feature of photo-
graphic emulsions is that the thickness of the
track left by the charged particle is propor-
tional to the degree of ionization, which is in
turn proportional to the velocity of the parti-
cle. In general, a slow-moving particle will pro-
duce a thicker track than a fast-moving parti-
cle. As the muon slows down in the emulsion,
therefore, the track must get thicker. In the
ﬁgure, if the muon had actually decelerated
before decaying at point C, then the width of
the track near point C must have been much
larger than the width near point B. Of course,
by examining the track, we can conclude that

2

there is no noticeable diﬀerence in width along
the entire segment BC. Hence, the muon de-
cays at point C while in motion. (The distri-
bution of the energy of the resulting positron
was discussed in an earlier paper[3]).

Q5. You pointed out that the neutrino is an
unnecessary hypothesis in beta decays and in
lepton decays. This violates the principle of
linear momentum conservation as well as an-
gular momentum conservation!

A. Linear and angular momenta are not neces-
sarily conserved in weak interactions. Speciﬁ-
cally, since decays such as beta decays, µ± de-
cay, π± decay, π0 decay, etc. are in most cases
observed to occur inside matter, then the lin-
ear and angular momenta of the decaying par-
ticle cannot be assumed to be conserved. The
momenta of nearby nuclei (or ﬁelds!) must be
factored in the momentum balance. Indeed, it
was pointed out[3] that the decays π± → µ±
and µ± → e±, when they occur inside mat-
ter, then they are likely one-body decays. Fur-
thermore, when we apply the principles of en-
ergy and momentum conservation to a decay
such as π0 → γγ (assuming that the energy
is given by the quantity mv2), then we must

3

conclude that such a decay is a momentum
non-conserving decay.

Q6. By saying that a neutrino does not ex-
ist in beta decay and in muon decay, are you
trying to suggest that Fermi’s theory of beta
decay and Michel’s theory of the muon decay
are false?

A. No. Fermi’s theory of beta decay and
Michel’s theory of muon decay are fundamen-
tally sound theories. They successfully ex-
plained the shape of the electron’s energy spec-
trum because they are based on the simple
concept of “momentum sharing”, that is, shar-
ing of the available momentum space between
the electron and other particles. The problem
is, the “other particles” don’t have to be neu-
trinos. As we indicated above, the other par-
ticles already exist inside matter, where the
decay takes place. So, it is clear why those
“momentum sharing” theories were successful
in explaining the shape of the decay spectrum.
The existence of the neutrino, on the other
hand, was merely a hypothesis for satisfying
Einstein’s equation H = mc2.

Q7. Neutrinos from nuclear reactors have
been observed experimentally. The measured
neutrino ﬂux (based on the known cross-
section) also correlates very well[7] with the
calculated ﬁssion rate in the reactor. How can
you then claim that the neutrino does not ex-
ist in beta decay?

A. We may very well call the highly penetrat-
ing particle that is observed to emerge from
nuclear reactors a “neutrino”. However, we
must point to two issues here: 1) Some pre-
liminary calculations based on the kinematic
data provided in recent reactor experiments
(to be published by the author in the near fu-
ture) show that this particle is actually a par-

ticle of meson-like mass and carries very little
energy; 2) It is very likely that this particle
emerges from the debris of particles that must
be generated when the highly energetic ﬁssion
products of 235U and 239Pu come to stop within
the core of the reactor. This explains why the
measured ﬂux correlates with the ﬁssion rate
in the reactor. The hypothesis that such a par-
ticle emerges from the beta decay of the ﬁssion
products, however, is a hypothesis that cannot
be veriﬁed, and, in view of the above remarks,
is likely untrue.

Q8. The notion of “zero rest energy” is still
diﬃcult to accept!

A. It may be diﬃcult to accept, but the real
question is whether this is the truth. Since
a picture is usually better than a thousand
words, we list below some of the known parti-
cle decay spectra (shown in the earlier papers
by the author):

As we can see, in many particle decay spectra,
events are observed with nearly zero total en-
ergy. The appearance of the quantity m0c2 as
a peak in the annihilation spectrum of e−e+
(which also shows a Gaussian distribution of
energy) was explained in ref.[1] and suggest
that the electron and the positron annihilate
with a relative velocity that is approximately
equal to c.

Q9. The law H = mc2 may be inaccurate.
But what is the assurance that H = mv2 is
the accurate representation of the equivalence
between mass and energy?

A. There are a number of reasons that sup-
port the mathematical expression H = mv2.
They are the following:

• It reconciles the two important theories of
special relativity and wave mechanics (see
ref.[1]).

• It explains all the particle decay spectra.

• It is fully distinguishable from Bohr’s the-

ory of the atom (see ref.[2]).

• It explains why a reaction such as µ+ →
e+ + γ has never been observed (see
ref.[3]).

• It predicts that the electron’s wave func-
tion in the hydrogen atom must be con-
ﬁned within the Bohr radius,
in agree-
ment with a totally independent predic-
tion made by Dirac (see ref.[4]).

2. On the 4-vector representa-
 
tion of Special Relativity:

In the 4-vector representation of special rel-
ativity there are often two parallel approaches
that are believed to lead to the total energy

4

equation H = mc2. The ﬁrst is by using the
invariants of the Minkowski spacetime, speciﬁ-
cally, the mass invariant and the length invari-
ant; the second is by using the Lorentz trans-
formations. Our objective in this section is to
demonstrate that what applies in the case of
the original formalism of Einstein is the same
that applies in the case of the 4-vector formal-
ism of Minkowski. Speciﬁcally, we will demon-
strate that regardless of the approach that we
choose in the Minkowski formalism, the total
energy equation H = mc2 was an interpreta-
tion, not a derived result.

important

Speciﬁcally,

Another
conclusion that will
emerge from this analysis is the fact that while
Einstein’s original formalism of 1905 was not
ﬂawed (except for the interpretative result re-
lated to the total energy), his subsequent 4-
vector formalism of 1912 [8] (which was clearly
inﬂuenced greatly by the work of Minkowski)
was indeed ﬂawed.
the ﬂaw
was the generalization of the electromagnetic
energy-momentum vector to include ordinary
matter, based solely on the earlier assumption
that H = mc2, but based on no other physical
or mathematical fact. More speciﬁcally, what
we will demonstrate in the following analysis
is that while the 4-velocity of a light signal
is an invariant (in accordance with Einstein’s
postulate of 1905), the 4-velocity of a mate-
rial particle is not an invariant, and hence its
4-momentum is not an invariant as the cur-
rently accepted 4-vector representation of spe-
cial relativity states. Here, of course, we must
point out to another serious ﬂaw in the cur-
rent understanding of many physicists:
the
current understanding is that the magnitude
of any 4-vector in the Minkowski spacetime
must be an invariant. This is incorrect for
the following reason: the Minkowski formu-
lation asserts that the “length”, or distance
between any two points in spacetime, given

by (x2 + y2 + z2 − c2t2)1/2 is invariant under
the Lorentz transformations. This does not
mean, however, that the time-rate of varia-
tion of length (a quantity that we call velocity)
must also be an invariant. In fact, neither Ein-
stein nor Minkowski suggested that a quantity
such as velocity (and hence momentum) has
to be invariant. Of course, this is true under
the Lorentz transformations as it is true under
Galilean transformations.

An even more important result that will
emerge is that if the ﬂawed 4-velocity expres-
sion is corrected, then the total energy equa-
tion H = mv2 emerges naturally! Other
conclusions, such as the fact that the equa-
tion H = mv2 transforms properly under the
Lorentz transformations, will also be pointed
to.

2.1. The “invariants” of the Minkowski
spacetime and the total energy formula-
tion:

The idea of the mass invariant emerged from
the well-known relativistic expression

Since this expression can be written as

H 2 = c2p2 + m2

0c4

− m2

0c2 = p2 −

H 2
c2

(1)

(2)

Then obviously the quantity (p2 − H 2/c2) is
an invariant in any reference frame, due to the
constancy of the quantity m2
0c2. In mathemat-
ical terms, the invariant I m is deﬁned as

I 2
m = −m2

0c2 = pµpµ,

(3)

where pµ is the so-called “energy-momentum”
4-vector, deﬁned as

5

pµ = (px, py, pz, iH/c).

(4)

Einstein actually derived this 4-vector for the
special case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in his
analysis of 1912 (the derivation was based es-
sentially on earlier work by Poincar´e) and he
pointed out,
in view of the above remarks
about the total energy, that this form of the
energy-momentum vector must be applicable
to ordinary matter as well. Although we can
essentially rework the same analysis by assum-
ing that H = mv2 instead of H = mc2, we
shall see that the problem actually has much
deeper physical roots. Now, the invariant I m
obviously has a very important physical mean-
It is just the rest mass m0, scaled by
ing.
the universal constant c. Thus, the invariance
of the rest mass in any reference frame is the
important physical concept that we need to
preserve, rather than the exact mathematical
shape of the energy-momentum vector. Un-
derstanding this point is critical.

The second invariant of the Minkowski formu-
lation is the length invariant I s (often called
the invariant interval), deﬁned as

I 2
s = x2 + y2 + z2 − c2t2

= x′2 + y′2 + z′2 − c2t′2

(5)

is a direct conse-
This invariant, of course,
quence of the Lorentz transformations and of
Einstein’s postulate of the constancy of the
speed of light c in all frames of reference. I s
can then be written as a 4-vector

Here, we are making the usual assumption
that a certain reference frame S is station-
ary, while a particle in its own rest frame
S′ is moving with a constant velocity v with
respect to S. Of course, I s in either case
is a representation of the Minkowski coordi-
nates. By diﬀerentiating I s with respect to
the proper time τ of the particle, we obtain the
so-called “4-velocity” ~u of the particle (where,
as usual: dτ ≡ dt′ = dt/γ, γ = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2
and dx/dτ = (dx/dt).(dt/dτ ) = γvx); the 4-
velocity is then given by

~u = (γvx, γvy, γvz, iγc),
~u′ = (0, 0, 0, ic)

in S′

in S, or

(7)

It is now easy to see (by virtue of the fact that
γ2 = (1 − v2/c2)−1 and v2
z = v2) that

x + v2

y + v2

(u)2 = (u′)2 = −c2.

(8)

A common “derivation” of the mass-energy
equivalence relationship (not originally given
by Einstein) is to then multiply the mass in-
variant m0 by this new “velocity invariant”, c2,
and hence obtain the famous equation H0 =
m0c2. Why this particular product should be
the correct relationship between mass and en-
ergy? (as the reader will now realize, Eq.(8)
is merely a statement of the principle of the
constancy of the velocity of light in all refer-
ence frames. The notion of “energy” is not
present at all in the above relationships). The
issue goes back to Einstein’s old interpreta-
tion. Such a product is just what Einstein sub-
consciously predicted as the equivalence be-
tween mass and energy.

I s = (x, y, z, ict),
I s = (x′, y′, z′, ict′)

in S, or
in S′

We can then see that the above derivation
of the famous formula is essentially nothing
but Einstein’s old interpretation. But this is

(6)

6

not really the important issue here. To see
what the important issue is, let us look again
at the meaningless result in Eq.(7). This re-
sult will be indeed meaningless if we interpret
it as the “velocity of a particle”, because, in
such a case, it must be taken to mean that
“the velocity u′ of the particle in its own rest
frame is equal to c”. Of course, we are talk-
ing about a 4-dimensional space here rather
than the usual 3-dimensional space; but what
does a result like that mean physically? As
we must now fully realize, Eqs.(7) and (8)
are essentially statements of the principle of
the constancy of the velocity of light c.
In
words, they can be written as follows: “The
velocity of light c is the same in the particle’s
frame as it is in any other frame”. Clearly
then, we cannot make the conclusion that c is
one of the velocity components of the parti-
cle. Let us look at the problem from a much
wider perspective: this kind of problem actu-
ally has roots which are deeply embedded in
the subconscious of physicists when they use
the powerful tool of mathematics. When we
deal with a particle or a system of particles,
we must understand that we are dealing es-
sentially with two diﬀerent physical problems:
the ﬁrst problem is the problem of kinemat-
ics and the second problem is the coordination
of such kinematics by means of light signals.
Although the two problems must obviously be
related in any physical theory, there is actually
a huge diﬀerence between the two. Concepts
such as velocity, momentum and energy are
usually related to the problem of kinematics,
while concepts such as causality are usually re-
lated to the problem of coordination. The lack
of understanding of this diﬀerence can lead to
serious ﬂaws in any theory (there is no ques-
tion that Einstein’s analysis in his manuscript
of 1912 [8] was greatly inﬂuenced by the purely
mathematical ideas of Minkowski). Let us ex-
amine more carefully what the Minkowski co-

ordinates in Eq.(6) mean. Those coordinates,
of course, resulted from the invariant repre-
sentation of Eq.(5). This invariant, I 2
s, is es-
sentially more or less a statement of the prin-
ciple of the constancy of the velocity of light
and the fact that the coordinates (x, y, z) and
(x′, y′, z′) satisfy the Lorentz transformations.
Hence, the Minkowski coordinates are coordi-
nates that were derived purely from the prob-
lem of the coordination of events by means of
light signals. This is why the velocity of light
c appears in the 4th component of the vector
(x′, y′, z′, ict′). While the 4th coordinate ct′
is essential for the Minkowski formalism (be-
cause it is based on the Lorentz transforma-
tions) we must be very careful when we decide
to take the time derivative of that 4th coordi-
nate in order to calculate a velocity component
for a particle, because we will then be mixing
the problem of the coordination of events with
the problem of the particle’s kinematics, which
is an approach that surely leads to meaningless
results. As we saw, the diﬀerentiation led to
a velocity component equal to c, which is just
the velocity of light that was needed in order
to solve the coordination problem. As a hypo-
thetical example, if we had used 106ct′ instead
of ct′ as the 4th coordinate, we would have
obtained a velocity component equal to 106c.
Does this then mean that the ﬁnal calculation
of the energy of the particle will be correct?
How about a purely Galilean transformation
in which c = ∞, what does this tell us then
about the “4th component” of the velocity u′
of the particle? We can therefore clearly see
the danger of taking the concepts which are
used solely to solve the problem of the coor-
dination of events and using them to predict
numerical values for the dynamical properties
of a particle.

How can we solve the above problem, then,
and still maintain the 4-vector formalism of

7

Minkowski?
The solution is to separate
the kinematics problem from the coordination
problem. Speciﬁcally, we must assume that
the 4-velocity u′ of the particle in its own rest
frame is the same as its 3-velocity: 0. Hence,
we must assume that u′ = (0, 0, 0, 0). This
means that when we take the derivative of the
4th Minkowski coordinate ict′ (in Eq.6) with
respect to the proper time τ , the result must
be 0. Hence, we must assume that (note that
τ ≡ t′)

d

(ct′) = 0 = c + t′ dc

This means that

(9)

(10)

At a ﬁrst glance, it may seem that we are tak-
ing a potentially wrong approach, since we are
obviously violating the principle of the con-
stancy of the velocity of light c! Not so! When
the particle under consideration is a material
particle, then the c in the Minkowski coordi-
nate ict′ is not usually interpreted as the “ve-
locity of light”, rather, in relativistic language,
it is referred to as the “light-like” velocity com-
ponent of the particle. In fact, it is purely a
mathematical abstraction. This must be es-
pecially clear in view of the above discussion.
There is absolutely no reason, on either physi-
cal or mathematical grounds, that this “light-
like” component must be treated as a con-
stant. This was the ﬂaw in Einstein’s analysis
of 1912. As we shall see, when this restriction
is removed, remarkable results will be indeed
obtained. Now, what Eq.(10) means is that
the “light-like” component of the velocity will
be decelerating in the particle’s rest frame, so
the net result is that the “kinematic”, or phys-
ical velocity of the particle is zero.

In order to obtain the 4-velocity of the par-
ticle in the observer’s frame S, we diﬀerenti-
ate the Minkowski coordinates in Eq.(6) again
with respect to the proper time τ . The ﬁrst
three components will remain unchanged (that
is, γvx, γvy, γvz). The 4th component will now
give (note that t′ = γt if we let x = 0 in the
Lorentz transformation)

The 4-velocity ~u of the particle will then be

and hence u2 is

(13)

Now we note that in the special case of v = c,
~u in Eq.(12) becomes (γvx, γvy, γvz, iγc) and
hence u2 = −c2 again. Accordingly, u2 is an
invariant only in the special case of a light sig-
nal.

What do the above results then mean as far
as the concept of the total energy of a mate-
rial particle is concerned? The answer is very
if we follow the traditional approach,
clear:
then H0 = m0u′2 = 0 in the particle’s rest
frame and H = mu2 = mv2 in the observer’s
frame. Let us now obtain an expression for the
4-momentum. The 4-momentum of the parti-
cle can be obtained by simply multiplying the
4-velocity in Eq.(12) by m0. Hence

pµ = (γm0vx, γm0vy, γm0vz, iγm0

(14)

v2
c

)

Compare this expression for the 4-momentum
with the original expression in Eq.(4). The
only diﬀerence is the appearance of the total
energy mv2 in the last term instead of the total
energy mc2. It is now straightforward to verify
that pµpµ, or the square of the 4-momentum
vector, is equal to m2
0v2. This again is to be
compared with the original expression pµpµ =
−m2
0c2. Here, we must of course emphasize the
fact that, contrary to the popular belief, quan-
tities such as velocity and momentum are not
universally invariant under the formulation of
Minkowski (they are of course invariant in any
single frame of reference, as the laws of con-
servation of energy and momentum require).
An additional important fact about the two
0v2
expressions pµpµ = −m2
is their physical meaning. If we ask whether
these expressions represent momentum or rep-
resent energy, the answer is neither. This is
because the vector pµ itself is a “hybrid” vec-
tor of energy and momentum. Traditionally,
the old expression pµpµ = −m2
0c2 has been
applied in problems such as particle collisions
and particle decays and was assumed to repre-
sent the “momentum squared”.
In practice,
it merely leads to a mass conservation law.
Because of the mathematical nature of the 4-
vector pµ, such an expression cannot be un-

0c2 and pµpµ = m2

derstood as a “momentum squared”. When
we write momentum conservation and energy
conservation equations in cases like particle
collisions or particle decays, we must deal with
the components of the 4-vector pµ in Eq.(14)
separately. The ﬁrst three components are a
true representation of momentum, while the
4th component is a true representation of en-
ergy. Hence, a quantity such as pµpµ cannot be
used by itself in a conservation law, since there
is no “hybrid” conservation law that comprises
both energy and momentum.

To summarize the above discussion: according
to the modiﬁed formulation, the rest mass m0
and the spacetime interval I 2
s are invariants
as in the usual theory, but the 4-velocity and
the 4-momentum are not. They are invariants
only in the special case of a light signal.

2.2. The connection between the total
energy and the Lorentz transformations:

In view of the conclusions just reached, we
shall now proceed to investigate the relation-
ship between the total energy and the Lorentz
transformations. The relationship between the
total energy and the “plain” Lorentz transfor-
mations (that is, excluding the Minkowski for-
mulation) is discussed in the Appendix to this
paper.

If we assume the simple case of motion along
one axis only, the Lorentz transformations are

x′ = γ(x − vt)
y′ = y
z′ = z
t′ = γ(t −

vx
c2 ),

(15)

or, in matrix form (and using the Minkowski

9

coordinates),

x′

When we diﬀerentiate the coordinates with re-
spect to the proper time τ , we note that we
must take the derivative of any coeﬃcient to
the coordinate ict, because the variable “c”
(when it is attached to that coordinate) must
be treated as the “light-like” component dis-
cussed above.
In the above transformation
matrix, the coeﬃcients of ict are the quantities
iγv/c in the ﬁrst row, and γ in the last row.
Since γ is a constant, then dγ/dτ = 0. The
derivative of iγv/c is iγv.d/dτ (c−1), where c
is the light-like component. It is straightfor-
ward to verify that this quantity is equal to
iγv/ct′ = iγv/cγt = iv/ct. Hence, when we
diﬀerentiate with respect to τ , the above ma-
trix representation will be written as follows
(note that the derivative of ict′ is equal to 0
and that of ict is equal to iγv2/c):

The question now, of course, is whether each
of the components of the pµ vector (includ-
ing the total energy γm0v2 in the last compo-
nent) identically transforms to 0 in the parti-
cle’s frame. Since vx = v, then a simple check
shows that this is indeed the case. The conclu-
sion is hence that both the energy mv2 and the
momentum mv transform properly under the
Lorentz transformations to a null quantity in
the particle’s frame. In the Appendix, a con-
nection is made between the total energy mv2
and the “plain” Lorentz transformations.

3. Issues related to the original
formulation of wave mechanics:

3.1. The concepts of phase velocity and
group velocity:

One important question that was asked re-
peatedly after the publication of the ﬁrst pa-
per on this subject[1] is why the phase velocity
of a matter wave cannot be equal to c2/v as
the original theory predicts. We will attempt
in this section to give a better explanation for
that problem.

First of all, the concept itself was mathemati-
cally ﬂawed. Superposition of waves does not
result in one distinct phase velocity. We must
have a number of phase velocities. Now, when
we superimpose waves, it is well known math-
ematically that each phase velocity vp = ωi/ki
and that the group velocity vg = dω/dk (where
ω is the angular frequency and k = 2π/λ is the
propagation constant). As was pointed out in
ref.[1], the two fundamental relationships of
wave mechanics: λ = h/p and H = hν to-
gether make a statement about the total en-
ergy of a particle; that is, H = (pλ)ν = pu,
where u is some velocity. The question here
is what is u exactly? Is it a phase velocity

or a group velocity? Apart from the fact that
H = pu is a total energy equation, we must
also note, since H = ¯hω and p = ¯hk, that
the equation leads to the relationship ω = ku.
Hence we must conclude that

dω
dk

ω
k

=

= u

(21)

This means that the group and the phase ve-
locities are the same. Note that in arriving to
the conclusion in Eq.(21) we have of course as-
sumed that u is a constant, i.e., not a function
of k. Indeed, the traditional approach to the
problem is to assume that u has a value of c2/v
(a constant), where v is the particle’s veloc-
ity, in order to satisfy the relativistic equation
H = mc2 (as was pointed out in ref.[1]). u is
then called the “phase velocity”. But, in or-
der to satisfy the basic principles of physics,
another assumption that also holds is that
dω/dk, or the group velocity, must be equal to
v. Hence it is clear, in view of Eq.(21), that the
fundamental inconsistency between wave me-
chanics and special relativity has never been
resolved. Of course, a quantity that is taken by
default to be equal to c2/v cannot also be equal
to v. Simply stated, the velocity of propaga-
tion of energy cannot have two diﬀerent values.

One important derivation that is given by
many authors and which “seems” to bypass
the problem (see for example ref.[9]) starts
with the longer relativistic expression H 2 =
0c4, calculates an expression for the
p2c2 + m2
group velocity dω/dk as a function of ω/k,
and since dω/dk must be equal to v, the result
that is reached then is that ω/k = vp = c2/v.
This derivation, however, is no diﬀerent from
the above derivation in that, by “forcing” the
group and the phase velocities to have dif-
ferent values, it completely ignores the simple
and unequivocal mathematical relationship in
Eq.(21). As was demonstrated in ref.[1], if we

11

abide by Eq.(21), that is, assume that u =
vg = vp = v, then we reach the conclusion that
the total energy H = pu = mv2. In Sec.4 of
this paper, it is shown that if we use the longer
relativistic expression H 2 = p2c2 − m2
0v2c2
(where H = mv2 in this modiﬁed equation),
we reach again the result that vg = vp = v.

3.2. De Broglie’s derivation of the re-
lationship λ = h/p:

De Broglie’s original derivation of the impor-
tant relationship λ = h/p can be found in a
number of standard references (see ref.[9] for
example). Amazingly, as we shall conclude,
while the formula was correct, the approach
that was used to derive it was not.

De Broglie started by assuming a wave func-
tion that describes a stationary particle, of the
form ψ′ = exp(iω′t′). By using the Lorentz
transformation of time t′ = γ(t − vx/c2), then
ψ′ = exp(iγω′[t − vx/c2]). Since this equa-
tion (in principle) is a traveling wave equa-
tion, de Broglie then concluded that the quan-
tity c2/v must represent the velocity of the
wave in the observer’s frame. The rest of the
derivation that leads to the formula λ = h/p
is then straightforward and consists of letting
H = hν = mc2 and substituting the product
λν for the quantity c2/v. As it is well known
historically[10], de Broglie later oﬀered the hy-
pothesis that c2/v is only a “phase” velocity
and that the real, or “group” velocity is ac-
tually v so that the particle and its associated
wave would not part company. However, as we
indicated, the problem with such a hypothesis
is that it directly contradicts the simple con-
clusion in Eq.(21).

Let us try to understand the problem with
the above approach that led to the indicated
contradictions. The Lorentz transformation of

time t′ = γ(t − vx/c2), which includes the co-
ordinate x, strictly assumes that “x” is only
one geometrical point. From the viewpoint of
a stationary observer, a traveling wave, in the
observer’s frame, cannot be described by one
“x” coordinate. The correct approach for in-
cluding a traveling wave within the relativistic
transformations is to assume ﬁrst that the “x”
coordinate is equal to zero (and hence the time
transformation will be t′ = γt) and then write
a true traveling wave equation in the observer’s
frame, that is

ψ = exp i(kx − ωt)

(22)

This was indeed the approach that was taken
by Shr¨odinger and certainly this explains why
Shr¨odinger’s equation has been unquestion-
ably successful (there is no doubt that de
Broglie, as a Ph.D. student, was under pres-
sure to formulate his theory in a manner that
does not lead to contradictions with H =
mc2). Now, by noting that k = 2π/λ and
ω = 2πν, ψ can be written as

ψ = exp i

x − ωt

(23)

Assume ﬁrst that the particle is moving with
a velocity v ≪ c so that the relativistic eﬀects
can be ignored. In this case, ordinary (non rel-
ativistic) wave mechanics state that λν = v,
or the wave’s velocity. Now, if the relativistic
eﬀect is to be included, then the wavelength λ
becomes λ/γ (length contraction) and the fre-
quency ν becomes γν (frequency shift). The
result therefore is that λν is still equal to v.
We can see, then, that the ﬂaw in the origi-
nal approach that led to the result λν = c2/v

12

was the incorrect use of the Lorentz transfor-
mation.

starts with the usual relativistic expression
(see ref.[11])

If we now follow the rest of de Broglie’s deriva-
tion, but use H = mv2 instead of mc2, we have
H = mv2 = hν, hence

H 2 = p2c2 + m2

0c4

(25)

If we now replace H by mc2 and p by mv we
have

p = mv =

m2c4 = m2v2c2 + m2

If we multiply this expression by v2/c2, we get

If we now let H = mv2 we ﬁnally have

Which is of course de Broglie’s well known for-
mula. De Broglie was aware that this relation-
ship can be derived in a number of diﬀerent
ways, and for that reason he raised it to the
level of a postulate. Concerning the approach
that was used in deriving it, however, this is
certainly one of the rare cases in science in
which an incorrect derivation procedure still
led to the correct result.

A modiﬁed Klein-Gordon

equation and de Broglie disper-
sion relation:

In this section we present derivations for a
modiﬁed Klein-Gordon equation and a mod-
iﬁed de Broglie dispersion relation. The con-
clusions are: 1) in the case of a massless par-
ticle, the dispersion relation is the same as
the original one; and 2) in the case of a mas-
sive particle, we still conclude that the phase
and the group velocities are the same, that, is
vg = vp = v.

4.1. The Klein-Gordon equation:

H 2 = p2c2 − m2

0v2c2

(28)

This is a modiﬁed energy-momentum rela-
tionship and was in fact derived previously
in ref.[1]. Notice that the quantity m2
0v2 =
p2 − H 2/c2. It is therefore a correct represen-
tation of the vector pµ in Eq.(14).

To obtain the modiﬁed Klein-Gordon equa-
tion, we start with the well known relationship

∇2ψ = −k2ψ = −

This is the modiﬁed Klein-Gordon equation.

But since dω/dk = vg = v, we then conclude
that ω/k = vp = v. The group and the phase
velocities are therefore the same.

and hence the modiﬁed de Broglie wave dis-
persion relation is

Summary:

¯h2ω2 = c2¯h2k2 − m2

0c2v2

(34)

For m0 = 0, we can see that the relation be-
comes ¯h2ω2 = c2¯h2k2, which is of course the
same as in the usual theory.

To obtain the group velocity, vg = dω/dk,
we diﬀerentiate the dispersion relation with re-
spect to k, getting (note: only the magnitudes
of the vectors p and k will be represented)

From this paper and the ﬁrst paper by the au-
thor on this subject[1] it must be clear that the
fundamental inconsistency between the theo-
ries of special relativity and wave mechanics
had not been resolved, despite de Broglie’s ef-
forts to reconcile the two theories. This fact,
together with the unequivocal failure of the
equation H = mc2 to explain many experi-
mental (and theoretical) results, point to one
inevitable conclusion: Einstein’s interpreta-
tion of 1905 concerning the relationship be-
tween mass and energy was ﬂawed. The rea-
son for this is actually not diﬃcult to under-
stand:
the Lorentz transformations are not
far-reaching enough to make predictions about
physical quantities such as energy. Special rel-
ativity is merely a simple mathematical map-
ping of time and coordinates. The sensible
way, then, of merging special relativity with
other theories is to make it compatible with
other theories, rather than to assume that
the Lorentz transformations have an unlim-
ited power of prediction. This, basically, is
the misconception that prevailed for the past
100 years.

withstanding, it is quite simple to show that
the total energy H = mv2 transforms prop-
erly under the “plain” Lorentz transforma-
tions. When we write the transformations in

and diﬀerentiate the coordinates with respect
to the proper time τ , we obtain the 4-vector
(v′
x = 0, 0, 0, i) on the l.h.s. and the 4-vector
(γvx, 0, 0, iγ) on the r.h.s. The transforma-
tions can then be written in the compact form

(40)

The physical meaning of those two simple
equations is very important. The ﬁrst equa-
tion, as we can see, is a velocity transformation

equation. The second equation was essentially
a time transformation equation. When we dif-
ferentiated with respect to time, it became an
equation that merely describes how the quan-
tity γ transforms; more clearly, since vx = v,
then

i = −i

or,

v2
c2 γ2 + iγ2,
v2
c2 )

1 = γ2(1 −

(41)

As we can see, the product is indeed equal
to 1. If we therefore multiply the two equa-
tions in (40) by any constant, then the sec-
ond equation will always transform that con-
stant into itself, by virtue of the relationship
in Eq.(41). This observation is very impor-
tant. The traditional approach has been to
assume that there is a “rest energy” in the
particle’s frame, given by the constant m0c2,
which then becomes γm0c2 in the observer’s
frame by virtue of the second equation; that is,
the transformation is γm0c2 ↔ m0c2. But the
whole notion that a quantity such as m0c2 is a
valid physical representation of energy by no
means can be deduced from the simple trans-
formations in Eq.(40). So where did this no-
tion emerge from? Again, it is nothing but
Einstein’s old interpretation.

Let us now examine the relationship between
the total energy expression γm0v2 and the
plain Lorentz transformations. As we saw, the
second transformation in Eq.(40) is -after the
time is taken out- essentially a transformation
of any constant, regardless of how we may for-
mulate that constant. Now, the ﬁrst transfor-
mation, however, is the one that carries a much
more important physical meaning. It is a ve-
locity transformation equation. If we multiply
by m0, then it becomes a momentum transfor-

15

mation equation. As a check, multiplying by
m0 (and letting vx = v) gives

m0v′ = (γ

iγv)

γm0v

(42)

or,

m0v′ = γ2m0v − γ2m0v = 0.

(43)

Hence, we get the expected transformation of
the relativistic momentum γm0v in the ob-
server’s frame to 0 in the particle’s frame. It
is also easy to verify that if we square both
sides of Eq.(42) and divide by m0, we get the
following equation

m0v′2 = (γ3 − γ3

iγ3v − iγ3v)

= (0 0)

γm0v2
iγm0v !

 

γm0v2
iγm0v !

 

(44)

Hence, the transformation γm0v2 → m0v′2
also results in a null quantity in the parti-
cle’s frame. This conﬁrms that H = γm0v2
transforms properly under the plain transfor-
mations. Note, however, that we have relied
on the ﬁrst transformation, not the second. As
we pointed out, that second transformation -
after the removal of the time- essentially trans-
forms any constant into itself. The association
of the constant m0c2 with the second transfor-
mation (and calling that constant “energy”)
was not based on any physical concept other
than Einstein’s original interpretation.

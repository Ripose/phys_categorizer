Abstract

It is proved that in order to keep both the lagrangian and the motion equation of non-Abelian
gauge ﬁelds unchanged under the gauge transformation simultaneously, some restriction conditions
should be established between the gauge potentials and the group parameters. The result is equiva-
lent to the Faddeev–Popov theory. For non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds, it leads to the result that the gauge
potentials themselves are unchanged under gauge transformations. In this way, the mass items can
be added into the Lagrangian directly without violating gauge invariability and the theory is also
renormalizable so that the Higgs mechanism becomes unnecessary.

PACS numbers: 11.15-q, 11.30.-j, 12.60.Fr

According to the Yang-Mills theory, in order to keep the Largrangian unchanged under the local
gauge transformation, the transformation rules of the ﬁeld φ and its covariant diﬀerentiation should
be deﬁned as

φ′(x) = exp[
µ(x)φ′(x) = exp[

Dµ(x) = ∂µ + Aµ(x)

Aµ(x) =

Here T α are group elements and θα(x) are group parameters. The function forms of θα(x) are
considered arbitrary at present. From Eq.(2), we can get the transformation rule of gauge potentials

is unchanged under gauge transformation. But the Largrangian with mass items can’t keep unchanged
under gauge transformation.

However, it is easy to prove that the motion equation of non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds can’t keep
unchanged under gauge transformation in general while the Largrangian of gauge ﬁeld is invariable. In
order to keep the motion equation of gauge ﬁeld unchanged simultaneously, a restriction relation should
be established between the gauge potentials and the group parameters. The free electromagnetic ﬁeld
is discussed at ﬁrst. Because there exist the Lorentz condition ∂µAµ = 0, free electromagnetic ﬁeld’s
motion equation is

∂µFµν = ∂2Aν −

∂ν∂µAµ = ∂2Aν = 0

U (1) gauge transformation is deﬁned as:

′
ν(x) = Aν (x)

−

∂νθ(x)

So the gauge transformation of Eq.(8) is

∂µF ′

µν = ∂2A′

ν(x) = ∂2Aν (x)

∂ν∂2θ(x) = 0

g

−

In order to keep the motion equation unchanged, we must have

∂ν∂2θ(x) = 0

−

= constant but ∂2bν = 0.
It means that ∂2θ = b = constant, or ∂νθ = bν = constant, or ∂νθ = bν 6
So in order to keep the motion equation of free electromagnetic ﬁeld unchanged under U (1) gauge
transformation, the form of group parameter θ(x) can’t be arbitrary. Only when θ(x) take three forms
above, the motion equation is invariable. As for non-free electromagnetic ﬁeld, the motion equation is

∂2Aµ(x) =

jµ = i

It is obvious that that the restriction condition Eq.(11) is also eﬀective to keep non-free motion
equation unchanged under U (1) transformation. On the other hand, for general U (1) gauge ﬁelds,
= 0, U (1) gauge transformation of motion equation
because there exists no Lorentz condition, ∂µAµ 6
is
∂ν∂µA′
∂µF ′

∂ν ∂µAµ = ∂µFµν

µν = ∂2A′

(13)

ν −

µ = ∂2Aν −

So the motion equation can keep unchanged without any restriction of group parameter, or θ(x) can
take any function form.

For SU (N ) non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld, the motion equation is (1)

∂µF α

µν + gf αβγAβ

µF γ

µν = 0

(14)

Under the gauge transformation deﬁned in Eq.(4) and (6), the motion equation becomes

It is easy to see that the solution of the formula above is

∂µθα = gf αβγθβAγ

In fact, by considering Eq.(14) and (17), as well as the anti-symmetry relation of group construction
constant f αβγ, the left side of Eq.(16) becomes

f αβγf βρσθρAσ

f αβγf γρσθβAρ

By the Jacobian relation f ασγf γρβ+f αργf γβσ+f αβγf γσρ = 0, we prove that the Eq.(17) is the solution
of Eq.(15). Similarly, for non-free SU (N ) non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld, when there exists interaction
between spinor particles and gauge particles, the motion equation of gauge potential is:

∂µF α

µν + gf αβγAβ

µF γ

µ =

(19)

It is obvious that that the restriction condition Eq.(17) is also eﬀective to keep the equation unchanged
under gauge transformation. It can be known from Eq.(4) that Eq.(17) just means A′α
µ, i.e.,
gauge potential itself is unchanged under gauge transformation. The result notes that if we want to
keep the Lagrangian and the motion equation of non-Alberian gauge ﬁeld invariable simultaneously
under gauge transformation, the gauge potentials should be invariable under the transformations. For
SU (N ) gauge group with α = 1, 2
N , Eq.(14) represents 4N equations. So there are also 4N
independent group parameters, i.e., there are 4 sets group parameters satisﬁes Eq.(17). It means that
the forms of group parameters are not unique. Because θα(x)
= constant in this cases, even though
gauge potentials are unchanged under gauge transformation, the local gauge transformations of other
ﬁelds φ(x) and their covariant diﬀerential deﬁned in Eq.(1) and (2) are still meaningful.

µ = Aα

· · ·

It should be emphasized that motion equation can’t contain arbitrary group parameters after
gauge transformation, otherwise the motion equation become arbitrary and meaningless. So we call
the gauge theory, in which group parameters are arbitrary, as a complete local gauge theory. We
call the gauge theory, in which group parameters can’t take arbitrary form as incomplete local gauge
theory. It can be said that so-called local gauge invariability actually implies incomplete local gauge
invariability. For non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld, the complete local gauge invariability is only a belief
without inevitability, for it would destroy the gauge invariability of motion equation in general. It
will be proved below that as long as the complete local gauge invariability is replaced by incomplete
local gauge invariability, the Higgs mechanics would become unnecessary and the description of gauge
theory would also become more symmetrical and simple.

It is shown below that the result above coincides with the Faddeev-Popov theory (2) In order to
avoid inﬁnity, Faddeev and Popov suggested that the integral over function space should be restricted
on the hyper-surface decided by gauge condition

(20)

In this way, the freedom degrees of gauge ﬁelds are decreased from 4N to 3N . The following relation
is used to restrict orbit integral

Taking the simplest form to let bµ = 0, we get Eq.(17). So the result in this paper coincides with
the Faddeev-Popov theory, or it is the simplest form of the Faddeev-Popov theory. It can be seen
that though restriction relation (23) can eliminate the inﬁnity of orbit integral, it can’t make motion
equation invariable under gauge transformation. To make both the orbit integral and the motion
equation of non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds invariable, the restriction relation δ(∂µbµ) should be changed
into δ(bµ). So Eq.(21) should be re-written as

It can be seen below that the change of ghost particle’s action has no essential inﬂuence on interaction
theory for ghost particles are ﬁctitious.

Because gauge potential is unchanged under gauge transformation with A′α

gauge ﬁeld, we can add mass item into the Lagrangian directly without violating gauge invariability.

It can be proved that when the interaction between gauge particles and other particles are considered,
corresponding W, T identity can also be obtained and the theory is also renormalizable. For simpliﬁ-
µ, Fermi ﬁeld ψ, and ghost ﬁelds C+
cation at ﬁrst, we consider a system composed of gauge ﬁeld Aα

and Cα. Let Sf represent the action of gauge and Fermi ﬁelds, Sh represent the action of ﬁxed gauge

is Sef f = Sf + Sh + Sg with

By the way, because there is no restriction of ghost equation for SU (N ) ﬁelds, the function F in
Eq.(41) can be arbitrary. For simpliﬁcation, we can take F = 0 directly so that it is unnecessary for
us to introduce Eq.(47) and (48) agin. In this case we have Y ¯ψ = Yψ = 1 in (55).For higher order
processes, renormalization can also be carried out by the similar procedure in the current theory.

The mass item’s gauge transformation in the united theory of weak-electric interaction is discussed
at last. We only discuss the transformation of lepton ﬁeld’s mass items. The result is suitable to quark
ﬁelds. In the united theory, we use chiral ﬁelds to describe weak interaction. The transformation rules
of left hand and right hand ﬁelds under SU (2)

lepton ﬁeld with form

can’t not keep unchanged under SU (2)
U (1) transformation. Similar to gauge ﬁeld’s mass item, in
the current theory, the mass items of lepton ﬁelds can’t yet be added into the Lagrangian directly.
The Higgs mechanics is needed.
It is proved below that this problem can be resolved solved, by
establishing a proper restriction relation between group parameters. The Higgs mechanics. According

In the formula, mA sin θw is photon’s mass and product item AµZµ represent two point’s interaction.
Because theses two items do not exist actually, we should cancel them in the action. As taking Rζ

In sum, because the Higgs particles can’t be found up to now, it is still a big problem if there
exists the Higgs particles. At present, some persons believe that the Higgs particles do not exist at
all. Some theoretical modes have been put forward to replace the Higgs mechanics. For example, the
Higgs particles are regarded as the bounding states of some new positive and anti-quark particles. But
all these theories have some diﬃcult problems. It can be said that the scheme provided in this paper
is simplest and more rational without increasing any new particles or extra hypotheses. In order to
ensure the invariability of motion equation of gauge ﬁelds under gauge transformation, this scheme is
also necessary. The theory is meaningless if the invariability of motion equation of gauge ﬁelds can’t
be ensured. By giving up the principle of complete local gauge invariability and adopting the principle
of incomplete local gauge invariability, we don’t need the hypotheses of Higgs mechanics again. The
description of theory can also become more simple and symmetrical.

Reﬂection on some possible eﬀects of the interactions between zero-point radiation
and electrons

Rafael Alvargonz´alez
Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain
(Dated: September 26, 2013)

Knowing the magnitude of the energy ﬂow inherent to zero-point radiation allows us to approach
the question of its possible interaction with particles of matter. Its photons are not diﬀerent from the
rest, and must in principle be subject to the Compton eﬀect and the Klein-Nishima-Tann formula
for its cross section. On this assumption, it is shown here that zero-point radiation may be powerful
enough to explain Poincar´e’s tensions and to supply an eﬃcient cause for gravitation. This could be
only the case if the classic radius of the electron measures 3.624093×1010 qλ, where qλ is the minimum
wavelength for electromagnetic radiation, and if the wavelength of the most energetic photon in the
actual zero-point radiation is 3.986214 × 1014 qλ. To the ﬁrst of these numbers there corresponds the
energy 1.595 × 1019 eV for the photon whose wavelength is 1qλ, which agrees with the maximum
energies observed in cosmic ray photons. This gives also the relation Ge = 0.414007/(kλ)4, where
Ge is the number measuring the gravitational constant in the (e, me, c) system.

I. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS ON
ZERO-POINT RADIATION

Sparnaay’s 1958 experiments [1] exposed the existence
of zero-point radiation, which Nernst had considered as a
possibility in 1916. However, Sparnaay was not looking
for it, since he was only trying to check Casimir’s hy-
pothesis about the mutual attraction of two uncharged
conductor plates placed very close together [2, 3]. This
attraction should have disappeared when the tempera-
ture approached absolute zero, but Sparnaay found that
at near that temperature there was still some attraction
not accounted for by Casimir’s hypothesis, being inde-
pendent of temperature and obeying a very simple law;
it is directly proportional to the surface of the plates, and
inversely proportional to the 4th power of the distance d
between them. Sparnaay observed this force when the
plates were placed in a very complete vacuum at near
zero-absolute temperature. For a distance of 5 × 10−5
cm between the plates, he was able to measure a force of
0.196 g cm s−2, and deduced the formula

f =

ks
d4 ,

where ks = 1.3 × 10−18 erg cm. In a near-perfect vacuum
and at a temperature very near absolute zero, which im-
plies the absence of any “photon gas”, the phenomenon
observed by Sparnaay could only be produced by a ra-
diation inherent to space. This could be only the case
if its spectrum is relativistically invariant, which could
only happen if its spectral distribution is inversely pro-
portional to the cubes of the wavelengths –in other words,
if the number of photons of wavelength λ which strike a
given area within a given time is inversely proportional
to (λ)3.

A function of spectral distribution which is inversely
proportional to the cubes of the wavelengths, implies a
distribution of energies which is inversely proportional

to the 4th power of the wavelengths, because the en-
ergies of the photons are inversely proportional to the
wavelengths. In 1969, Boyer [4] showed that the spectral
density function of zero-point radiation is

fϕ(λ) =

1
2π2

1
(λ∗)3 ,

(1)

(2)

where λ∗ is the number giving the measurement of wave-
length λ.

This function produces the next, for the corresponding

energies

Eϕ(λ) =

1
2π2

hc
λ

1
(λ∗)3 ,

for λ → 0, Eϕ(λ) → ∞. There must therefore be a
threshold for λ, which will hereafter be designated by
the symbol qλ.

In the Sparnaay eﬀect, the presence of a force which is
inversely proportional to the 4th power of the distance d
between the plates, while the distribution of energies is
also inversely proportional to the 4th power of the wave-
lengths, leads us to infer that the cause of the apparent
attraction must lie in some factor which varies inversely
with the wavelength, and which causes a behaviour diﬀer-
ent from the photons of wavelengths equal to or greater
than d, since:

Kn

−5 →

K
4d4

∞

Xn=d

The factor in question turns out to be the proportion
of photons which are reﬂected, not absorbed; that is the
coeﬃcient of reﬂection ρ, while the diﬀerent behaviour
is caused by the obstacle which the presence of each one
of the two plates oﬀers to the reﬂection from the inner
face of the other one, of photons of wavelength equal or

greater than d. As we know, the energy which is trans-
ferred by a reﬂected photon is double that transferred by
one which is absorbed.

To simplify the following arguments, it is convenient
to use the (e, me, c) system of measurements in which
the basic magnitudes are the quantum of electric charge,
the mass of the electron and the speed of light. In this
system, the units of length and time are respectively le =
e2/mec2 and te = e2/mec3.

The results of Sparnaay’s experiments provide a link
with reality which may be enough to show the intensity
of the energy ﬂow belonging to zero-point radiation. A
recent paper [5] has shown that this ﬂow is one which cor-
responds to the incidence in an area (qλ)2 of one photon
of wavelength qλ every qτ , plus one photon of wavelength
2qλ every 23qτ , etc. up to one photon of wavelength nqλ
every n3qτ , where qτ = qλ/c [6]. This radiation implies
the energy ﬂow per (qλ)2 and qτ which is given by

(cid:19)

(3)

where kλ = le/qλ = te/qτ [7].

This energy ﬂow produces a force per (le)2 which is

given by

F(e,me,c) =

(kλ)4 mec
te

which when expressed in the c.g.s. system and per cm2
is given by

F(c.g.s.) = 3.409628 × 1034(kλ)4 gcm
s2 .

In cosmic rays, photons have been observed with ener-
gies of the order of more than 1019 eV, [8] which implies
that the value of kλ must be greater than 2.273 × 1010.
In conse-
The value of F(c.g.s.) is therefore immense.
quence the analysis of the possible interactions of zero-
point radiation with the elementary particles assumes
enormous interest.

II. ZERO-POINT RADIATION AND POINCAR´E
TENSIONS

“If we have a charged sphere, all the electrical
forces repel, and the electron will tend to ﬂy
apart... The charge must be mantained over
the sphere by something which stops it from
ﬂying oﬀ. Poincar´e was the ﬁrst to point out
that this ‘something’ must be allowed for in
the calculation of energy and momentum”.

The Feynman Lectures in Physics, Vol. II,

28-1 to 28-14.

If the electron’s mass and charge were distributed ac-
cording to some spatial conﬁguration, the repulsion of the

2

FIG. 1:

charge against itself would tend to cause the particle to
ﬂy apart. Seeing this, Poincar´e suggested that something
must exist which can counteract this repulsion and this
‘something’ has therefore been named ‘Poincar´e’s ten-
sions’. The possible conﬁguration must be one which has
no favoured direction, which implies that it must have
spherical symmetry. Electrostatic repulsion would ap-
pear in the form of a centrifugal force. To meet this,
Poincar´e’s tensions would have to be arranged as cen-
tripetal forces able to counteract it. When submitted to
these ﬁelds of opposing forces, the charge of the electron
would tend to distribute itself equally over a spherical
surface. Zero-point radiation, which arrives equally from
all directions of space, provides centripetal energy ﬂows
towards every imaginable spherical surface, and from
these ﬂows there could be derived equally centripetal
ﬂows, to ﬁll the role of Poincar´e’s tensions. Sparnaay’s
experiments have allowed us to measure the intensity of
the energy ﬂows inherent to zero-point radiation; Comp-
ton’s experiments discovered the laws which govern the
phenomena of scattering and energy transfer produced by
the interaction of photons with free particles and matter.
Finally the diﬀerential cross section for these phenom-
ena follows the Klein-Nishima-Tann formula. With this
knowledge we can attempt to calculate the centripetal
force which could be produced by the zero-point radia-
tion, on an electron with its charge distributed equally
over a spherical surface of radius rx.

The collision of a photon with a free particle of mat-
ter, shown in Fig. 1, produces the Compton eﬀect. The
colliding photon of energy Eλ and wavelength λ, loses
part of its energy to the particle, and is diverted at an
angle θ to its previous trajectory. When losing energy, it
increases its wavelength by an amount which is given by
Compton’s equation

∆λ = λc(1 − cos θ),

where λc = h/mc, and m is the particle mass. For the
electron, Compton’s wavelength us ∆λ = λce = h/mec =
2π/αle.

In the case of zero-point radiation, the free particle of
matter, which is subjected to equal forces from all direc-
tions, does not move, but suﬀers compression towards its
centre.

The encounter of a photon with an electron does not
always produce the Compton eﬀect; the diﬀerential cross
section for this dσ is given by the Klein-Nishima-Tann

A ﬁrst attempt to solve the problem showed us that
the energy ﬂow (3) would be excessive. Sparnaay’s mea-
surements allow us to deduce that, in the case of photons
with wavelength equal to or greater than 5 × 10−10 cm,
the energy ﬂow of the zero-point radiation agrees with
the energy ﬂow corresponding to the incidence, in an area
(qλ)2, of the photon of wavelength qλ every qτ , plus an-
other of wavelength 2qλ every 23qτ , up to a photon of
wavelength nqλ every n3qτ . However this does not mean
that, at present, the photon with the shortest wavelength
in the zero-point radiation, has to be the photon of wave-
length 1qλ. If we suppose that its wavelength is xqλ, the
ﬂow of energy to be taken into account is:

assumption does not cause any future contradiction and
leads to a value of kλ > 2.273 × 1010, which means that
the energy of the photon with wavelength 1qλ is greater
than 1019 eV, it must be considered as reasonable. Ac-

Figure 2 shows an electron conﬁgured as a spherical

this interaction happens with zero-point radiation falling

electron, and coming from all directions of the half space

deﬁned by the tangent plan at N and opposite to O, the
total energy ﬂow over the said area will be Wx/2, and

the sum of the components according to the radius ON of
equal forces F , which arrive from all the said directions.
If we imagine a hemisphere of radius F with its center
at the origin of coordinates O, and equatorial plane z =
0, we can easily see that the said components have the
same measurements as the heights z of the points on the
surface of the said sphere, and that the number which
expresses their sum is that which measures the volume

of the said hemisphere, i.e.
case we must divide this number by the area of the said
sphere, because the force FOR is the sum of those which
come from all directions. To each point of this area there
corresponds one of those directions. Therefore the sum

III. BEHAVIOUR OF TWO ELECTRONS
IMMERSED IN ZERO-POINT RADIATION

Figure 3 shows two electrons whose centres are nqλ
apart. The photons of zero-point radiation which follow
the straight line joining these centres going in the di-
−−−→
O1O2, strike the ﬁrst of these particles, entering
rection
at A and emerging at B, and then the second particle,
entering at C and emerging at O.

The total ﬂow of the zero-point radiation which inter-
−−−→
O1O2, with the electron whose

acts, along the direction
center is at O1, is

Wn =

Wx

since the radiation leaving O1 has to be equally dis-
tributed between the 4πn2 positions of area (qλ)2 which
lie at the distance nqλ from O1. This energy ﬂow loses
at A a proportion k of its energy to the electron whose

center is at O1, thus directing a force

towards O1,

and continues its journey towards B with an intensity
Wn(1 − k). At B, it again interacts with the same elec-
tron and loses Wn(1 − k)k; the remaining Wn(1 − k)2
continues towards C, and there loses Wn(1 − k)2k to the
electron whose center is as O2. Finally, the remaining
Wn(1 − k)3 loses Wn(1 − k)3k at D, to the same electron.
The same occurs with the zero-point radiation which fol-

lows the direction
O2O1, and thus there are produced
at each of the two electrons the following ﬂows, directed
from the center of each towards the center of the other

Wn{[k − k(1 − k)3] + [k(1 − k) − k(1 − k)2]} = Wn
×(4k2 − 4k3 + k4)

because of the quantum character of
tually me = 1 in the (e, me, c) system; therefore merx =
n(mele) where n is a natural number. For n = 2 the value
of kλ would lead to an energy inferior to 0.7 × 1018 eV
for the photon of wavelength 1qλ; which is less than the
values observed in the most energetic cosmic ray photons.
The equations (14), (15), (16) and the identity (12)
allow us to obtain the values of kλ, number of qλ per le,
and x, wavelength of the most energetic photon in the
actual zero-point radiation, because we know:

1. The present value of G;
Ge = 2.399998 × 10−43.

in the (e, me, c) system

2. The present value of me = 1 in the said system.

3. That the wavelength of the most energetic pho-
ton must be less than 4.4 × 10−11le, because pho-
tons with energy greater than 1019 eV have been
observed in cosmic rays. This means that kλ >
2.273 × 1010.

4. The quantum character of

me = 1 and kλ > 2.273×1010, requires that rx = le.

By supposing rx = 1, it is easy to reach, after some

results:

kλ = 3.6240926 × 1010
x = 3.9862136 × 1014

We
3.624093 × 1010kλ
value
(1le = 3.624093 × 1010kλ);
the energy of the pho-
ton of wavelength qλ would be 1.595 × 1019 eV, which
agrees with the observations and with the upper limit
mentioned above.
In this case, if the photon of zero-
point radiation which has the maximum energy, has
a wavelength of 3.986214 × 1014qλ(1.0999205 × 104le),
the true radius of the electron must be equal to its
classical radius and the energy ﬂow of this radiation
would be exactly what is required for it to play the role
of Poincar´e’s tensions, and to ensure that, because of its
interactions with them, the electrons mutually attract
each other with a force equal to that of gravity.

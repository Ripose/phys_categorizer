Economics from a Physicist’s point of view:
Stochastic Dynamics of Supply and Demand
in a Single Market. Part I

Vladimir T.Granik ∗ and Alex Granik†

Abstract

Proceeding from the concept of rational expectations, a new dy-
namic model of supply and demand in a single market with one sup-
plier, one buyer, and one kind of commodity is developed. Unlike the
cob-web dynamic theories with adaptive expectations that are made
up of deterministic diﬀerence equations, the new model is cast in the
form of stochastic diﬀerential equations. The stochasticity is due to
random disturbances (”input”) to endogenous variables. The distur-
bances are assumed to be stationary to the second order with zero
means and given covariance functions. Two particular versions of the
model with diﬀerent endogenous variables are considered. The ﬁrst
In the second version
version involves supply, demand, and price.
the stock of commodity is added. Covariance functions and variances
of the endogenous variables (”output”) are obtained in terms of the
spectral theory of stochastic stationary processes. The impact of both
deterministic parameters of the model and the random input on the
stochastic output is analyzed and new conditions of chaotic instabil-
ity are found. If these conditions are met, the endogenous variables
undergo unbounded chaotic oscillations. As a result, the market that
would be stable if undisturbed loses stability and collapses. This phe-
nomenon cannot be discovered even in principle in terms of any cobweb
deterministic model.

1 Introduction

It is universally accepted wisdom that supply and demand interaction is the
main driving force of a market economy. The word ”interaction” means that
supply and demand, as well as the price they depend upon, change with
time and are therefore not static phenomena but dynamic processes. These
price-quantity processes can develop in diﬀerent ways. They can converge to
an equilibrium state, oscillate, collapse or explode, all in a regular or chaotic
manner. To gain insight into this complex behavior, supply-and-demand
problems should be treated not only statically, as in economics textbooks,
but also dynamically.

Yet surprisingly, the dynamic consideration of these problems has, almost
completely, given way to a static analysis. As a result, the inadequate static
approach has led to a limited and sometimes even incorrect understanding of
the price-quantity interaction. A case in point is the single one-commodity
market with one seller and one buyer. There are some quasi-dynamic models,
to be brieﬂy discussed below, expressly designed for a study of stability of
supply-and-demand equilibrium price in such a market.

No wonder that such speciﬁc models fail to deal with the whole interactive
process of supply, demand, and price. Instead, this process is routinely dis-
cussed from the static point of view based on the well-known oversimpliﬁed
assumptions:

1. Supply S and demand D are functions only of a price P and do not
depend on time t. The variables S, D, P , which are included in the analysis,
constitute an endogenous set (a market) E = {S, D, P }.

2. The plots of S(P ) and D(P ) have respectively positive (”upward”)
and negative (”downward”) slopes everywhere. These curves intersect at a
point of equilibrium Ee = {Se, De, P e} ⊂ E where supply equals demand
(Se = De) and the equilibrium price P e clears the market.

2

Suppose that a set G of all exogenous variables which can disturb the
market equilibrium is excluded from the analysis. This is equivalent to an
assumption that G = ∅ where ∅ is an empty set. Yet there still may be
an endogenous force ,say, the seller who raises the price P that can dis-
place the market E from the equilibrium point Ee to a non-equilibrium
state En = {Sn, Dn, P n} 6= Ee. In the end, however, as the static analy-
sis shows, the market E will automatically return from En to Ee . Hence,
according to the static consideration, the equilibrium of the simplest market
E = {S, D, P } is always stable provided G = ∅

This discovery stands so high in economics that it is frequently called
the ”law” of supply and demand (e.g., [1]). Even its introductory part,-the
existence of an equilibrium price P e, the fact already known in the 18-th
century,-was praised by Thomas R. Malthus as the ”ﬁrst, greatest, and most
universal principle” of economics. To a certain extent this is true since the
”law” of supply and demand can not only give us information about the
equilibrium state Ee , but also predict in some instances the impact of the
exogenous variables G 6= ∅ on the market E = {S, D, P }

For example, a static analysis of an aggregate one-commodity market
(macroeconomics) enabled one to gain an initial insight into the enigmatic
phenomena of unemployment, inﬂation, etc., and explain how they appear
when either the aggregate supply (AS) or the aggregate demand (AD) curve
shifts in response to the variations in the exogenous set G . Despite, however,
its merits, the famous ”law” of supply and demand has to be taken with a
grain of salt because actually it is not a universal principle.

Firstly, the change in the exogenous variables G often leads to the ”shifts
on both the demand and supply side at the same time, so the simple rules
[the above explanations] ... don’t work” [2]. What happens in this case to,
say, macroeconomics, or a market of commodities, depends on the shifts’
magnitude which the famous ”law” cannot predict.

Secondly, contrary to the conventional assumption, the AS and AD static
curves can be ”perverse.” This means that ”AS, at least in some situations,
slope downward and/or AD may slope upward” and ”the usual implications
of the macro AS − AD analysis may be misleading.” [3]

Thirdly, and most importantly, even if the set of exogenous variables
G 6= ∅ the static ”law” of supply and demand does not work either as long
as it disregards the time-dependent nature of the endogenous variables E .

3

Indeed, let us instead of the familiar static set E = {S, D, P } consider a
new dynamic set E(t) = {S(t), D(t), P (t)} where the endogenous variables
S, D, P (supply, demand, and price) are functions of time t.

Now, since all the three variables change with time, so will do both the
curves of supply and demand as functions of the price. Consequently, at dif-
ferent points the curves will have, generally speaking, diﬀerent slopes which
can be positive, or negative, or zero. These dynamic phenomena undermine
the fundamental feature of the static ”law” of supply and demand,-the ﬁxed
positive (negative) slope of the supply (demand) curve,-and hence invalidate
the ”law’s” assertion that the market equilibrium is always stable if the ex-
ogenous variables G 6= ∅. Because of this fault, the static ”law” becomes
impractical and can perhaps serve, as it does, only as a ﬁrst step in under-
standing supply-and-demand problems.

Such ”myopic preoccupations of traditional equilibrium analysis” [4] per-
sisted for a long time. Only the last few decades have seen a monotonic in-
crease in studies of price-quantity dynamics. The respective dynamic models
have been developed on the basis of (1) diﬀerential and (2) diﬀerence (cob-
web) time-dependent equations.

The ﬁrst (”diﬀerential”) direction of research goes back to Hicks [5] and
Samuelson [6]. They focused on the study of stability of supply-and-demand
equilibrium in a single and multiple markets in terms of diﬀerential equa-
tions. Because of such a narrow objective, Hicks’ and Samuelson’s models
were too limiting. They were incapable of dealing with the general problem of
price-quantity evolution although the time-dependent diﬀerential equations
did make it possible. Consequently, by a strange coincidence, the ”diﬀeren-
tial” direction in price-quantity dynamics gave way to the cobweb models.
Such models were introduced in the 1930’s (e.g., [7]) and have since then
became the prevailing theoretical tools for studying price-quantity dynamics.

One of the ﬁrst who employed a special cobweb model for analyzing the
price stability was Samuelson [6]. His model came to be known as a naive
expectations theory. Later on a more sophisticated (and up to now widely
used) cobweb model was proposed based on a concept of adaptive expecta-
tions. The model is reviewed in detail in our forthcoming paper. Now we
only point out some of the shortcomings of the adaptive expectations theory
(see, e.g., [8]).

4

1. In this theory, the curves of supply fS and demand fD are supposed
to be ”rigid,” their shape is ﬁxed and time-independent. This brings us
back to the simplistic static assumption adopted in textbooks. But in price-
quantity dynamics there are no ”rigid” supply and demand curves. As has
been already mentioned, both the curves are generally dependent on and
changing with time.

2. The governing equations of the adaptive expectations theory are ex-
plicitly deterministic because no stochastic components are included. Only
by a special choice of the key deterministic functions fS and fD , the cobweb
model may be able to reveal some stochastic features of the price-quantity
dynamics. But because there are in fact no ”rigid” functions fS and fD, this
particular approach is in general overly restrictive. Therefore a better way
to study the chaotic behavior of the price-quantity process is to address it
directly, by incorporating stochastic functions into governing equations. Now
we can proceed with our new theory.

2 The Stochastic Dynamic Model

We begin with two assumptions.

1. It is clear that a proﬁt-minded supplier should acutely aware of his/her
costs. He/she will therefore control the actual output of commodity S(t) in
view of the diﬀerence PSt = P (t) − PS between the market price P (t) and
some characteristic price PS which includes all costs and the desired proﬁt.
It is reasonable to believe that the actual supply S(t) will in-crease if the
net price PSt > 0 , or decrease if PSt < 0 . So, PS can be interpreted as
the seller’s borderline price above which the supply of commodity will rise
or below which it will fall.

2. It is also clear that a sensible buyer will adjust his/her actual demand
for commodity Dt based on the diﬀerence PDt = P (t) − PD between the
market price P (t) and a characteristic price PD . The latter is formed by the
buyer’s needs and ﬁnancial opportunities, as well as by his/her tastes and
other unspeciﬁed psychological, physiological, etc.
factors. The higher the
price PD , the higher is the buyer’s willingness to purchase the commodity.
In other words, the actual demand D(t) is likely to increase if the net price
PDt < 0 , or decrease if PDt > 0. Hence, PD can be viewed as the buyer’s

5

borderline price below which the demand for commodity D(t) will rise or
above which it will fall.

All the factors inﬂuencing the price P (D),-the buyer’s needs, ﬁnancial
opportunities, tastes, etc.,-are, to a diﬀerent degree, random by nature. We
may therefore express P (D) as a sum of two components P (D) = hPDi + P D
where hPDi 6= 0 is a deterministic part (a mean) of PD while P D is a stochastic
disturbance of PD with a zero mean hP Di = 0. Besides, the seller’s borderline
price PS is similar to PD and is therefore also stochastic. Yet in the present
paper, for the sake of simplicity, the price is taken to be a deterministic
quantity.

Applying these two assumptions (as well as some others) to a rather in-
clusive rational expectations model (e.g., [9]), we have derived governing
relations of our dynamic theory:

It is a system of three stochastic ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential equations for
the set of three endogenous variables E(t) = {S(t), D(t), P (t)}. In Eqs. (2.1),
dots denote diﬀerentiation with respect to time t; the quantities a, b, c, k are
non-negative constants; φS(t), φD(t), φP (t) represent exogenous deterministic
functions inﬂuencing supply, demand, and price.

Now a natural question arises: What is the economic interpretation of the
governing equations (2.1). Let us ﬁrst look at the ﬁrst of these equations
which we designate as (2.1)1. Its meaning seems quite clear:

(i) If the market price exceeds the seller’s borderline price, supply will
rise. If the seller’s borderline price exceeds the market price, supply will fall.
(ii) If demand exceeds supply, supply will rise. If supply exceeds demand,
demand will fall. The meaning of next equation designated as (2.1)2is no less
clear:

(iii) If the buyer’s borderline price exceeds the market price, demand will

6

rise. If the market price exceeds the buyer’s borderline price, demand will
fall.

Lastly, let us the third of Eqs.(2.1) designated as (2.1)3. Its meaning has

been given by Samuelson’s dictum [6]:

(iv) ”If at any price demand exceeds supply, price will rise.

If supply

exceeds demand, price will fall.”

(2.1) is very simple.

We thus see that the paraphrase of Eqs.

If we
had started from this literal interpretation (that is, by inverting our ap-
proach), Eqs. (2.1) could have easily been written toutdesuite. Yet we have
avoided this path and derived the dynamic model (2.1), as mentioned before,
diﬀerently,- in terms of the more fundamental rational expectations model.
This has been done on purpose, in order to show that our model (2.1) not
only diﬀers from the rational expectations model, but also has a certain aﬃn-
ity with it which would otherwise have been diﬃcult, if not impossible, to
see.

There is also the other side of the coin. Once the stochastic equations (2.1)
are obtained, they lend themselves well to developing more inclusive dynamic
models of supply-and-demand to be dealt with elsewhere. It is important to
note that unlike Eqs. (2.1) and without them such advanced models are not
directly derivable from the rational expectations model (cf. [9]).

3 A Closed Deterministic Market

First we consider a closed deterministic market, that is, a market without
exogenous variables and stochastic disturbances. This means that in the
right-hand side of the model (2.1) we should omit the second and the third
vector components and thus obtain

(3.1)

It is a system of three deterministic ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential equations
which can easily be solved by using any traditional techniques (see, e.g.,
[10],[11]). Analytic solutions of Eqs. (3.1) are simple but rather cumbersome.
Therefore,in what follows, we restrict ourselves to the illustrations of typical
results.

Suppose that there is no damping, that is, the constant k = 0.

D(t) = −

[P (0) − A1]sin(βt) + A2t + A3 (3.3)

P (t) = [P (0) − A1]cos(βt) −

[S(0) − D(0)]sin(βt) + A1

(3.4)

where S(0), D(0), P (0) stand for initial values of supply, demand, and

We see that according to Eqs. (3.2)-(3.5),
• If hPDi > PS , then A2 > 0. Consequently, both supply and demand

increase in time,and the market is booming.

• If in addition S(0) 6= D(0) and/or P (0) 6= A1 , then the monotonic

increase of supply and demand is accompanied by undamped oscillations.

• If hPDi < PS , then A2 < 0. As a result, both supply and demand

decrease in time and the market goes south.

• If simultaneously S(0) 6= D(0) and/or P (0) 6= A1 , then the monotonic

decrease of supply and demand is followed by undamped oscillations.

• If hPDi = PS , then A2 = 0. Accordingly, both supply and demand
either oscillate [when S(0) 6= D(0) and/or P (0) 6= A1 ] or remain equal to
A3 = constant.

• If P (0) 6= A1 and/or S(0) 6= D(0), then the price P (t) oscillates.
• If both P (0) = A1 and S(0) = D(0), then the price p(t) does not change

and remains equal to the initial value P (0) = A1 .

The foregoing brief analysis leads to important conclusions.
1. The supply-and-demand dynamics is mainly inﬂuenced by the ratio
α = hPDi/PS . This ratio deﬁnes what may be called the market asymmetry.

8

2. If α = 1, the market is symmetric since both the seller and the buyer
adhere to the same borderline price hPDi = PS. As a result, the market will
neither expand nor collapse, i.e., it is in a sense stable.

3. If α 6= 1, the market is asymmetric because the seller and the buyer
adhere to diﬀerent borderline prices. Consequently, the asymmetric market
is, in the same sense, unstable, -it will either boom or collapse.

The above new criteria of stability are drastically diﬀerent from the cor-
responding stability conditions established by such ﬁgures as L. Walras, A.
Marshall, J.R. Hicks, and P.A. Samuelson [12]. The new criteria also show
that, contrary to the static ”law” of supply and demand, the equilibrium of
a single market is not always stable even if the set of endogenous variables
is empty [G(t) = ∅] as has already been mentioned in Introduction.

It is also interesting to observe that the seller’s borderline price PS is usu-
ally hidden from the buyer and, vice versa, the buyer’s borderline price hPDi
is generally unknown to the seller. The obvious inference is that incomplete
(asymmetric) information about the characteristic prices PS and hPDi avail-
able respectively to the seller and to the buyer may have either a beneﬁcial
or an adverse eﬀect on the market. This phenomenon has a direct bearing
on a theory of markets with asymmetric information [13].

Particular examples of the closed deterministic market described by (3.1)

will be considered in the next paper.

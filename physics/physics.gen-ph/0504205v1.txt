Abstract

We argue that the Path Integral formulation of Feynman can be
reconciled via a Planck scale underpinning for spacetime, with fuzzy
spacetime considerations.

1 The Path Integral Formulation

We ﬁrst argue that the Feynman Path Integral formulation essentially thrown
up fuzzy spacetime. To recapitulate [1, 2, 3], if a path is given by

Then the probability amplitude is given by

So that the total probability amplitude is given by

In the Feynman analysis, the path

appears as the actual path for which the action is stationery. For paths very
close to this, there is constructive interference, whereas for paths away from

x = ¯x(t)

1

this the interference is destructive.

We notice that this is also the formulation of the random phase [4]. How-
ever it is well known that the convergence of the integrals requires the well
known Lipshitz condition viz.,

∆x2 ≈ a∆t

(1)

We could say that only those paths satisfying (1) constructively interfere. We
would now like to observe that (1) is the well known Brownian or Diﬀusion
Equation. This has been commented upon extensively [5, 6, 7] and also [8].
The point is that (1) implies a minimum spacetime cut oﬀ, as indeed was
noted by Feynman himself [1], for if ∆t could → 0, then the velocity would
→ ∞.
these irregularities are such that the
As Feynman and Hibbs put it, “...
“average” square velocity does not exist, where we have used the classical
analogue in referring to an “average.”
If some average velocity is deﬁned for a short time interval ∆t, as, for exam-
ple, [x(t + ∆t) − x(t)]/∆t, the “mean” square value of this is −¯h/(ım∆t).
That is, the “mean” square value of a velocity averaged over a short time
interval is ﬁnite, but its value becomes larger as the interval becomes shorter.
It appears that quantum-mechanical paths are very irregular. However, these
irregularities average out over a reasonable length of time to produce a rea-
sonable drift, or “average” velocity, although for short intervals of time the
“average” value of the velocity is very high...”
To put it another way we are taking averages over an interval ∆t, within
which there are totally random and unphysical processes. It is only after the
average is taken, that we recover physical spacetime [9].
As has been argued in detail [6, 7] this is exactly the situation which we
encounter in the Dirac theory of the electron. There we have the unphysical
zitterbewegung eﬀects within the Compton time ∆t and as ∆t → 0 the ve-
locity of the electron → ∞ exactly as above [10]. It is only after averaging
over the Compton scale that we recover meaningful physics, that is Hermi-
tian position operators.
This existence of a minimum spacetime scale, it has been argued for quite
sometime is the origin of fuzzy spacetime, described by a noncommutative
geometry, consistent with Lorentz invariance. This was shown a long time

ago by Snyder [11]. In this case we have commutative relations like

[xı, xj] = ΘıjO(l2)

[xı, pj] = ˜Θıj¯h[1 + O(l2)]
It is interesting to note that the momentum position commutation relations
lead to the usual Quantum Mechanical commutation relations in the usual
(commutative spacetime) if O(l2) is neglected where l deﬁnes the minimum
scale. Indeed, as noted elsewhere, we have at the smallest scale, a quantum
of area. In other words Snyder’s purely classical considerations at a Compton
scale lead to Quantum Mechanics.

2 Zero Point Field

There has been much work connecting the Zero Point Field (or Dark Energy),
not only with the new cosmological scenario of an ever expanding universe,
which infact was predicted by the author [12], but also in the context of a
Planck scale underpinning of the universe–the Planck scale being the special
case of the more general Compton scale. It was infact argued that N ′ ∼ 10120
Planck oscillators provide an underpinning for the entire universe on the one
hand, and on the other, throw up the N ∼ 1080 elementary particles [13, 14].
It is interesting to note that the Zero Point Field itself leads to the Compton
Interestingly the momentum operators m~v do not satisfy the
scale [15].
Quantum Mechanical commutation relations with the position coordinators.
But if we add the electromagnetic momentum due to the background Zero
Point Field, then we recover the Quantum Mechanical commutation relations
and spin half [16]. Thus it appears that Classical Mechanics together with
the minimum Compton scale, or alternatively Classical Mechanics together
with the Zero Point Field leads to Quantum Theory. Infact several authors
like Marshall, Boyer and others had argued for Quantum Mechanics arising
from stochastic electrodynamics [17].
Indeed we could even compute the energy due to the Zero Point Field, which
in turn gives rise to the Lorentz force and recover the inertial energy.
We now observe that the coherent N ′ Planck oscillators referred to above
could be considered to be a degenerate Bose assembly. In this case as is well
known we have (z ≈ 1)

v =

V
N

3

(Cf.ref.[4]). V the volume of the universe ∼ 1084. Whence

So that the wavelength

v =

V

N ′ ∼ 10−36

λ ∼ (v)1/3 ∼ 10−12 = l

What is very interesting is that (3) gives us the Compton length of a typical
elementary particle like the pion. So from the Planck oscillators we are able
to recover the elementary particles exactly as in the references [13, 14].
Moreover, let us now consider the distant background assembly which is at
nearly the same energy. In this case we have (Cf.ref.[4])

hn~ki =

2
eβhw − 1

As we have assumed that the photons all have nearly the same energy, we
have,

hn~ki = hn~k′iδ(k − k′)
(5)
where hn~k′i is given by (4), and k ≡ |~k|. The total number of photons N, in
the volume V being considered, can be obtained in the usual way,

N =

∞

V
(2π)3 Z
0

dk4πk2hnki

where V is large. Inserting (5) in (6) we get,

2V

N =

(2π)3 4πk′2[ǫΘ − 1]−1[k] Θ ≡ βhw

where [k] is a dimensionality constant, introduced to compensate the loss of
a factor k in the integral (6), owing to the δ-function in (5).
We observe that, Θ = hw/KT ≈ 1, since by (5), the photons have the same
energy hw. We also use,

v =

and z =

λ being the wavelength of the radiation. We now have from (7), using (8),

At this stage we observe that as z is dimensionless, this equation is perfectly
consistent because both sides are dimensionless. Using (8) we get:

From (9) we conclude that, in this case,

z =

It must be observed that we consider the degenerate case in all the above
considerations and so z ≈ 1. What is very interesting is that (10) this time
gives us the correct microwave cosmic background radiation wavelength and
temperature.

3 Renormalization

The problem of Renormalization, as is well known was encountered ﬁrst in
Classical Electrodynamics [18]. This was because the electromagnetic self
energy of an electron viz., e2
r would → ∞ as the size r of the electron → 0.
On the other hand if r were not to → 0, that is the electron had a ﬁnite size,
then this would lead to its own problems requiring the introduction of, for
example Poincare stresses to hold the electron together (Cf.[18]).
On the other hand if we were to consider the electron as having a bare mass
and a physical mass, that is [19]

mphys = mbare +

e2
r

(11)

Then we could still have a ﬁnite physical mass, which would be what is
actually measured, by allowing inﬁnite two terms on the right side of (11)
to cancel each other out for the limit. This means we could preserve Special
Relativity and at the same time recover a ﬁnite physical mass. However
in Quantum Theory, there is no real problem with Special Relativity and
superluminal or non-local velocities if r were to be non zero, but of the order
of the Compton wavelength l. We can see this as follows. A particle can
travel from the spacetime point x1 to the spacetime point x2 causally only if
the interval is time like, that is

ηαβ(x1 − x2)α(x1 − x2)β < 0

5

On the other hand because of the Uncertainty Principle there is a non zero
probability for a particle to move from x1 to x2 even if the interval is space
like, that is with superluminal velocity as long as

(x1 − x2)2 − (x0

1 − x0

2)2 ≤

h2
m2 (c = 1)

In other words there is a breakdown of causal physics within the Compton
scale [20].
All this has direct relevance to our discussion in the previous two sections
about a minimum physical scale l and fuzzyness. The point is that either we
invoke Quantum Mechanics and thereby recover the Compton scale, or we
invoke the minimum scale l and recover Quantum Mechanics (Cf. also ref.[6]
for a discussion of the latter point).

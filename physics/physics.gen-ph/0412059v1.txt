Abstract

We assume that space time is curvature-free. Using statistical mechanics we
show that the universe is expanding. We also show that clock slows down
when time progresses from present to future. We predict that time advances
at the expense of energy towards future. We also show that any time variation
in the natural constants is unobservable.

I. INTRODUCTION

Our physical world is the manifestation of space, time and matter. A discipline which
relates space, time and matter is the general theory of relativity. Although general rela-
tivity is compatible with experimental tests [1,2], we present here an alternate approach to
incorporate matter content in a curvature-free space time.

We ﬁnd an analogy between bending of light in the gravitational ﬁeld and a light beam
trapped in an optical ﬁber. An optical ﬁber is able to trap a light beam in the core by total
internal reﬂection [3]. Consider an optical ﬁber and put it in a curved way. Let there is a
light source at one end and the observer is at the other end. The observer always sees the
source directed away from him and thus detects no curvature in the tube. Similar is the
case of a light coming from a star passing near the Sun. This produces a slight shift in the
apparent position of the star as seen by an observer at the Earth. The observer at the Earth
perceives that the star is actually situated at its apparent position and so he connects the
apparent position of the star with the Earth according to l = ct.

An interesting feature of optical ﬁbre is as follow: Take an extensionless optical ﬁber.
Put it in a volume element in such a way that it passes through all points of the volume
element. Send a light signal from one end which will shine all points within the tube. The
observer at the other end sees an array of points along the tube. But since the points belong
to the volume element, thus the observer sees the whole three dimensional space in his one
dimensional tube. In other words the observer can not distinguish between one dimension
or any higher dimensions.

We incorporate this idea in an oversimpliﬁed statistical model. In this article we empha-

size on qualitative analysis, numerical estimates will be discussed elsewhere.

II. MODEL

We assume that the universe is unique [4], that no part of the universe is disconnected
from the other part of the universe. Since the universe consists of say super-clusters which
in turns contain group of clusters and each cluster then consists of galaxies and so on.

Let us represent the universe by a set Gn

Gn = {Gn−1

1

, Gn−1
2

, .........., Gn−1

pn },

where Gn−1

i

represents ith super-cluster for instant. But since

Gn−1

i = {Gn−2

1

, Gn−2
2

, .........., Gn−2

pn−1},

Continuing this to sub-atomic level we ﬁnally get

G1

j = {G0

1, G0

2, .........., G0

p1},

where G0

k corresponds to constituent particle which has no further substructure.

Now the number of accessible states are given by [5,6]

Wn =

∆Vn−1 !

 

pn

where V is the volume of the universe and ∆Vn−1 is the volume occupied by Gn−1

. But since

i

where ∆Vn−2 is the volume occupied by Gn−2
on re-arranging we get

j

. Putting ∆Vn−2 from eq.(2) in to eq.(1) and

Generalizing and after re-arranging it, we ﬁnally get

or

where

where we have used the relation,

in which s is the entropy and kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, ∆V0 is the spread or uncertainty
in volume of the constituent particle. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the volume
of the universe is spherical, i.e. V ∼ l3, and also ∆V0 ∼ ∆l3. We get

Using the uncertainty principle (∆p∆l ≃ ¯h), we get

Now according to the our assumption, any observer will perceive that for light ray l = ct,
so eq.(7) becomes

t =

exp (S/3kB)

(10)

where we have used ∆t = ¯h/∆ε. Writing for S we have

This is in agreement with the law of increase of entropy. This determines entropy-time
arrow. As from the law of increase of entropy, entropy always increases and also time
is future oriented. So we can not draw a conclusion to say which quantity is the true
independent variable, time or entropy. In order to solve this problem we proceed as follow.

It is easy to see that

where sj is the entropy corresponding to an element Gj. This is the diﬀerence equation which
holds provided that all elements Gj−1 of Gj have equal entropy or otherwise sj represents
average entropy of Gj. Using eq.(11) in to eq.(8) and after iteration we ﬁnally get,

sj = pjsj−1

S = N(p)s0

where

Therefore eq.(10) becomes

N(p) = 1 + p1 + p1p2 + .... +

t =

exp (N(p)s0/3kB) ,

in which s0 is interpreted to be the intrinsic entropy of the constituent particle. The last
equation meets with a serious problem. In order that t kept on increasing then either s0
should increase or N(p). But since s0 is the entropy of constituent particle, it can not alter
t signiﬁcantly. Therefore N(p) should increase monotonically. This means that something
is continuously leaking from each element Gi−1 of Gi in to Gi of Gi+1. This may correspond
to some interaction which bounds the whole universe. It also conﬁrms that the universe is
unique. Since N(p) is some number which is diﬃcult to estimate, we can write it in terms
of mass.

Like eq.(11), we have a similar equation for mass,

where mj is the total mass of Gj. Eq.(15) holds under the similar arguments as eq.(11).
Now using eq.(15) in to eq.(13) and after iteration we ﬁnally get,

We say that M is Lyapunov variable, a variable that never decreases [7]. It is worth noting
that spontaneous creation of matter is discussed in literature [8,9] and also abandoned
because of the violation of energy-momentum conservation. It will become clear that our
case is diﬀerent and quite natural.

If M = 0, then

from here we can identify that ∆ε is the vacuum energy. Therefore eq.(16) can be read as

This equation is interesting in the sense that zero initial time is not allowed by the universal
time scales and otherwise if we set t0 = 0, then time can never begin. Using eq.(20) we can
deﬁne time-interval,

Clearly the time interval depends on the initial time. Let us deﬁne two intervals of time one
at time ti and the other at time tj > ti, given by

There are two alternatives:

and

i)

ii)

Now use

in eq.(22) we get

Let us investigate alternative (i) ﬁrst. We see that ∆mj < ∆mi. Therefore M will tend
to a limit and so t will become constant after that ∆t will become zero. This corresponds to
close universe. On the other hand alternative (ii) corresponds to open universe. It is clear
from the second alternative that ∆tj > ∆ti. It means that clocks slow down when time
advances from present to future.

which means that time advances towards future on the expense of energy.

Like time interval a similar expression can be obtained for length interval,

where

which shows that the universe is expanding. Eq.(27) is also true for close universe case. But
then the length interval becomes zero for l ≥ lmax.

To ﬁnd any time variation in the speed of light we see that

where l0 = ¯h/∆p and t0 = ¯h/∆ε. For photons ∆ε = ∆pc. Therefore eq.(28) becomes

which shows that ∆l expands at the same rate as ∆t is dilated. Hence any time variation
in the speed of light is unobservable. This agrees with the null results of any time variation
of the natural constants [1,10].

Since in our case the time interval, we call it cosmological second, is diﬀerent at diﬀerent
time. We are required to do care while adding cosmological seconds from the big bang till
now. The total time elapsed is,

where ∆tk is a cosmological second at time tk. The second alternative enables us to discretize
time,

tj = tj−1eη
where the dimensionless increment η = λ∆E/c2. Therefore the total time elapse is,

where n represents the number of cosmological seconds.

which shows that the diﬀerence between two consecutive cosmological seconds during the
early stage was small. During each cosmological second an amount ∆m was created from
energy in to mass due to vacuum ﬂuctuation and so an enormous amount of matter was
created very rapidly at the big bang. The creation process slowed down thereafter and it is
further slowing down.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have enveloped both classical and quantum regimes and treated them more or less
classically. It is a good approximation which is evident from the expression (17). In which
the lower values of index i refer to quantum regime which contributes negligibly small as
compared to the leading terms in the expression. We have left various parameters like η and
t0 undetermined. In future studies we wish to determine them

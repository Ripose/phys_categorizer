Abstract

The question what information is necessary for determination of a unique
solution of hydrodynamic equations for ideal ﬂuid is investigated. Arbitrary
inviscid ﬂows of the barotropic ﬂuid and of incompressible ﬂuid are consid-
ered. After integrating hydrodynamic equations, all information on the ﬂuid
ﬂow is concentrated in dynamic equations in the form of indeﬁnite functions,
whereas the initial and boundary conditions contain information on the ﬂuid
particle labeling.
It is shown that for determination of the stationary ﬂow
of the incompressible ﬂuid the vorticity on any stream line must be given.
Giving the velocity on the boundary, one does not determine the vorticity,
the vorticity cannot be given
in general.
on them via boundary conditions. This circumstance explains existence of
diﬀerent stationary vortical ﬂows under the same boundary conditions.

If there are closed stream lines.

Key words: ideal ﬂuid, Clebsch potentials, vorticity

1 Introduction

In the present paper we consider the statement of the ﬂow problem of barotropic
ﬂuid. If compressibility of the ﬂuid tends to zero, we obtain an incompressible ﬂuid.
We consider the incompressible ﬂuid as a special case of the barotropic ﬂuid, when

describing evolution of density ρ and that of the velocity potential ϕ, lose temporal
derivatives and turn into constraints on the state of the incompressible ﬂuid.

∂0ρ + ∇ (ρv) = 0 → ∇v = 0

(1.1)

As a result the statement of the ﬂow problem appears to be diﬀerent for barotropic
ﬂuid and for the incompressible one. On one hand, the description of the incom-
pressible ﬂuid is simpler, than that of barotropic one. On the other hand, the

incompressible ﬂuid is a nonphysical ﬂuid, because the speed of sound is inﬁnite,
and constraints on the state of the incompressible ﬂuid appear to be nonphysical
constraints. As a result the statement of the ﬂow problem for the incompressible
ﬂuid appears to be complicated, than for the barotropic one.

Nonstationary ﬂows are too diﬃcult for calculations, and as a rule one considers
stationary ﬂows, which do not contain temporal derivatives. This fact complicates
statement of the ﬂow problem, because the problem cannot be considered to be
an evolutional problem. Finally, the rotational stationary ﬂows are too diﬃcult for
calculation also, and one considers usually stationary irrotational ﬂows of the in-
compressible ﬂuid. Statement of the problem for rotational ﬂows of the incompress-
ible ﬂuid and for the irrotational ones appear to be quite diﬀerent. In particular,
the stationary irrotational ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid is determined uniquely by
the boundary conditions. The rotational stationary ﬂow may contain stream lines,
which do not cross the boundaries, and one cannot set the ﬂow problem, using only
boundary conditions.

We consider the statement of the ﬂow problem, starting from the simple case of
the arbitrary ﬂow of the barotropic ﬂuid, when the statement of the problem is very
simple. Imposing in series the constraints of incompressibility and of stationary, we
follow the evolution of the ﬂow problem statement.

In our investigation we use essentially the fact that dynamic equations for the
ideal barotropic ﬂuid can be integrated [1]. Indeﬁnite functions appear in dynanic
equations as a result of this integration. As a rule, the investigation of integrals of dif-
ferential equations is simpler and more eﬀective, than the investigation of diﬀerential
equations themselves, and we use this circumstance. Integration of hydrodynamic
equations is connected closely with a use of generalized stream function (GSF) [2]
and with GSF-technique which allows one to realize this integration.

We obtain hydrodynamic equations for barotropic ﬂuid from the variational prin-

ciple, which can be written in the form [2]

(1.2)

where jk = {j0, j} = {ρ, ρv} is the 4-ﬂux of the ﬂuid, ρ is the density and v is
its velocity. The quantity E = E (ρ) is the ﬂuid internal energy per unit mass,
which depends only on the density ρ. The quantity ρ0 = ρ0 (ξ) is a given weight
function of ξ. Variables ξ = {ξ1, ξ2, ξ3} are Lagrangian coordinates, labeling the
ﬂuid particles. Usually the Lagrangian coordinates are considered to be indepen-
dent variables. Here they are considered to be dependent variables ξ = ξ {t, x}.
Considering ξ as dependent variables, we shall refer to them as Clebsch potentials.
These potentials have been used by Clebsch for description of the incompressible
ﬂuid [3, 4]. In (1.2) and in what follows a summation over repeated Latin indices
is produced (0 − 3). All dependent dynamic variables j, ξ, p are considered to be
functions of x = {x0, x} = {t, x}.

scalars considered to be functions of x = {x0, x} = {t, x}, ξ = ξ(x). The functions
{ξ0, ξ1, ξ2, ξ3} are supposed to be independent in the sense that J 6= 0. It is useful to
consider the Jacobian J as 4-linear function of variables ξi,k ≡ ∂kξi, i, k = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Then one can introduce derivatives of J with respect to ξi,k. The derivative ∂J/∂ξi,k
appears as a result of a replacement of ξi by xk in the relation (1.3).

Variables ξ = {ξ1, ξ2, ξ3} are spatial Lagrangian coordinates of the ﬂuid particles,
whereas ξ0 is the temporal Lagrangian coordinate. It is ﬁctitious in the action (1.2).
The quantities ∂J/∂ξi,k are useful, because they satisfy identically to the relations

A use of designation (1.6) is very useful, and we have introduced this designation
in the variational principle (1.2) by means of the Lagrange multipliers pk = pk (x),
k = 0, 1, 2, 3.

To obtain hydrodynamic equations we should vary the action (1.2) with respect
to variables ξk, jk, pk, k = 0, 1, 2, 3. The variable ξ0 is ﬁctitious, and a variation
with respect to ξ0 gives identity.

Equations (1.7), (1.20) and (1.8) form the complete system of dynamic equations,
which consists of seven ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations for seven dependent variables

Four equations (1.22), (1.23) form a closed subsystem (Euler equations) of dy-

2 Integration of dynamic equations for barotropic

ﬂuid

There exist another form of hydrodynamic equations. The fact is that the equations
(1.18) can be integrated. Note that equations (1.18) are linear partial diﬀerential
equations for the variables pk, k = 0, 1, 2, 3. They can be solved exactly in the form

pk = g0 (ξ0) ξ0,k + gα (ξ) ξα,k,

k = 0, 1, 2, 3

(2.1)

where ξ0 ceases to be ﬁctitious and becomes to be a new dynamic variable. The
quantities g0 and gα, α = 1, 2, 3 are indeﬁnite functions of arguments ξ0 and ξ =
{ξ1, ξ2, ξ3} respectively.

Substituting (2.1) in (1.18) and using identities (1.5), one can verify that (2.1)
is a solution of equations (1.18) for any functions gi, i = 0, 1, 2, 3. It means that
expression (2.1) gives the general solution of (1.18). Taking into account that the
ﬁrst term in rhs of (2.1) is a gradient of some quantity ϕ, we may write (2.1) in the
form

pk = ∂kϕ + gα (ξ) ξα,k,

k = 0, 1, 2, 3

The ﬁrst equation (1.19) takes the form

ρ = ρ0 (ξ)

≡ ρ0 (ξ)

∂J
∂ξ0,0

∂ (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)
∂ (x, y, z)

≡ ρ0 (ξ)

∂ (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)

It follows from (2.2) and (1.19)

vµ = ∂µϕ + gα (ξ) ξα,µ,

µ = 1, 2, 3

Then equations (1.24) are transformed to the form

∂0ξµ + (∇ϕ + gα (ξ) ∇ξα) ∇ξµ = 0,

µ = 1, 2, 3

Let us set k = 0 in (2.2). Eliminating ξα,0 by means of (2.5), we obtain

which allows one to interpret the variable ϕ. On one hand, the variable ϕ is a
function of the temporal Lagrange coordinate ξ0. On the other hand, in the case,

6

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

when gα = 0 and ϕ is the velocity potential, the equation (2.7) may be considered

p2 + U (t, x) ,

U (t, x) =

∂ (ρE)

"

∂ρ #ρ=ρ0(ξ)∂J/∂ξ0,0

In this case the Clebsch potential ϕ may be regarded as the action variable.

Thus, we have the system of four equations (2.5), (2.6) for four dependent vari-
ables ξ, ϕ. If solution of this system (2.5), (2.6) has been obtained, the variables ρ,
v, are expressed via this solution by means of relations (2.3), (2.4).
If we are interested in determination of the ﬂuid ﬂow, i.e.

in determination of
variables ρ, v as functions of variables t, x, we must solve either four Euler equations
(1.22), (1.23) with proper initial and boundary conditions, or four equations (2.5),
(2.6) with properly given functions gα, α = 1, 2, 3 and properly given initial and
boundary conditions for variables ξ, ϕ.

Before comparative analyses of the two diﬀerent systems of dynamic equations
we consider transition to the case of the incompressible ﬂuid. To pass to the incom-
pressible ﬂuid, we consider the slightly compressible ﬂuid with the internal energy
of the form

E (ρ) = E0

E0, ρ1 = const,

ε ≪ 1

(2.8)

The incompressible ﬂuid appears in the limit ε → 0.

Let us substitute (2.8) in (2.6) and resolve the obtained relation with respect to

the term, containing the constant E0. We obtain

Other dynamic equations of the system (2.3) - (2.6) do not depend on ρ.

Conventional procedure of passage to the incompressible ﬂuid in (1.22), (1.23) is

an addition of the constraint

ρ = ρ1 = const

(2.11)

to the Eulerian equations and elimination of connection between the density ρ and
the pressure p. As a result the pressure p in (1.23) appears to be indeﬁnite.

Taking into account (2.11), the Euler system of hydrodynamic equations for the

incompressible ﬂuid takes the form

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

takes place also, but it is not an independent relation. It is a corollary of dynamic
equations (2.13), (2.14), (2.15).

Indeed, resolving (2.14) with respect to vα = ∂αϕ + gβ (ξ) ξβ,α, we obtain in

accordance with (1.5)

vα = ∂αϕ + gβ (ξ) ξβ,α =

Then (2.17) satisﬁes the relation (2.16), as it follows from (1.7) and (2.13).

Thus, in the case of incompressible ﬂuid we have three evolutional dynamic
equations, containing temporal derivatives, and one dynamic equation, which does
not contain temporal derivative (the ﬁrst equation (2.12) and the equation (2.13)).
This equation is a constraint, imposed on the state of incompressible ﬂuid.

3 Cauchy problem for barotropic ﬂuid ﬂow in

inﬁnite volume

To obtain an unique solution for the barotropic ﬂuid ﬂow in the inﬁnite volume, one
should give initial state ρ, v of the ﬂuid at the time moment t = 0.

ρ (0, x) = ρin (x) ,

v (0, x) = vin (x)

(3.1)

Evolution of the ﬂuid state ρ, v is determined by evolutional dynamic equations
(2.12).

In the case of the integrated system (2.3) - (2.6) the initial conditions (3.1) are to
be given, but these conditions are not suﬃcient for determination of unique solution
of equations (2.3) - (2.6). One needs to give initial values for the Clebsch potentials
ϕ, ξ. We choose the simplest initial conditions for the quantities ϕ, ξ

ϕ (0, x) = ϕin (x) = 0,

ξ (0, x) = ξin (x) = x

Substituting (3.1) and (3.2) in (2.4) we obtain

4 Cauchy problem for the incompressible ﬂuid

ﬂow in inﬁnite volume

The main diﬀerence between the barotropic and incompressible ﬂuids consists in
the constraint imposed on the state of the incompressible ﬂuid by the ﬁrst equation
(2.12). This condition does not contain temporal derivative and it is to be satisﬁed
at the initial moment t = 0

∇vin (x) = 0
It means that the initial state of the incompressible ﬂuid vin cannot be given arbi-
trarily. But the main property of initial state is the possibility of giving it arbitrarily.
To conserve this property, we are forced to redeﬁne the concept of initial state of
the incompressible ﬂuid. Let us consider the generalized stream function (GSF)
{ψ2, ψ3} [2] to be the quantity describing the state of the incompressible ﬂuid. The
velocity v, deﬁned via GSF by the relation

(4.1)

vµ =

∂ (xµ, ψ2, ψ3)
∂ (x1, x2, x3)

,

µ = 1, 2, 3,

(4.2)

satisﬁes the ﬁrst equation (2.12) for any choice of functions {ψ2, ψ3}. Considering
GSF as a state of the incompressible ﬂuid, we use two quantities {ψ2, ψ3} instead of
three components of velocity, but these quantities {ψ2, ψ3} may be given arbitrarily
at the initial time t = 0. It is very useful and important.

On the other hand, the variables j0 = ρ and j = ρv are described by relations
(1.12). Choosing ρ0 (ξ) =ρ1 =const, we obtain in the case of the incompressible ﬂuid
from (1.12)

ρ = ρ1

∂ (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)
∂ (x1, x2, x3)

= ρ1 = const,

jµ = ρ1vµ = ρ1

∂ (xµ, ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)
∂ (x0, x1, x2, x3)

,

µ = 1, 2, 3

(4.3)
The velocity v, deﬁned by the second equation (4.3), satisﬁes the ﬁrst equation
(2.12) identically, because

∂ (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)
∂ (x1, x2, x3)

= 1

Let us choose initial conditions in the form

ξ (0, x) = ξin (x) = x,

ϕ (0, x) = ϕin (x) = 0

vµ(0, x) = vµ

in(x) =

∂ (xµ, ψin2 (x) , ψin3 (x))
∂ (x1, x2, x3)

,

µ = 1, 2, 3

(4.6)

where ψin2, ψin3 are given functions of x (initial values of GSF). Then it follows from
(2.15) written at t = 0

gµ (x) =

∂ (xµ, ψin2 (x) , ψin3 (x))
∂ (x1, x2, x3)

,

µ = 1, 2, 3

(4.7)

(4.4)

Substituting (4.7) in dynamic equations (2.14) and setting ρ1/ρ0 (x) =const, we
obtain three dynamic equations for variables ξ

ξµ,ν 


ξα,ν = 0,

α = 1, 2, 3

(4.8)

and a constraint (4.4), imposed on the values of the quantities ξ.

Four equations (4.8), (4.4) form a system of dynamic equations for four dynamic
variables ξ,ϕ. Equation (4.4) may be replaced by the equation (2.16), which after
substitution of (4.7) takes the form

ϕ,νν + ∂ν 

ξµ, ψin2 (ξ) , ψin3 (ξ)
∂ (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

ξµ,ν 


where ψin2 (ξ), ψin3 (ξ) are given functions of argument ξ. We stress that the equa-
tions (4.8), (4.9) are to be solved at initial conditions (4.5). May we set ϕ = 0 in
the equation (4.9)? In general, no. If we set ϕ = 0, the equation (4.9) turns into
the equation

(4.9)

(4.10)

ξµ, ψin2 (ξ) , ψin3 (ξ)
∂ (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

∂ν 


ξµ,ν 


which is valid at t = 0, when ξ = x. If ξ 6= x, equation (4.10) is not valid, in general.
Thus, four equations (4.8), (4.9) form a system of dynamic equations for four
dynamic variables ξ, ϕ. Dynamic equations (4.8) are evolutional equations, de-
scribing evolution of ξ in the sense that they contain time derivatives of ξ. If the
state ξ (t, x), ϕ (t, x) of the ﬂuid is given at the time t, the dynamic equations (4.8)
determine the quantities ξ (t + dt, x) at the next time moment uniquely.

The equation (4.9) as well as the equation (4.4) is not an evolutional equation,
because it does not contain temporal derivatives. The value ϕ (t + dt, x) is not
connected with the value ϕ (t, x) directly. One can determine the unique solution of
(4.9), if there is some additional information about the variable ϕ on the boundary
∂V of the volume V , where the ﬂuid ﬂow is considered. Formally it follows from the
fact that the Poisson equation (4.9) has an unique solution in the region V , provided
a proper information is given on the boundary ∂V of the volume V .

In the case of the barotropic ﬂuid the corresponding equation (3.15) for ϕ is
evolutional, and one does not need such an information. At least at the point x,
which is far enough from the boundary ∂V , the values of ϕ (t, x) , 0 < t < T can
be determined uniquely for a time T , which is necessary for passage of the signal
from the nearest point of boundary ∂V to the point x. The speed of the signal is
equal to the sound speed in the ﬂuid. In the incompressible ﬂuid the sound speed is
inﬁnite, the time interval T = 0, and dynamic equation (4.9) is not evolutional. In
accordance with this fact the value ϕ (t + dt, x) depends on the boundary conditions
at the time t + dt, but not on the values of ϕ (t, x) and ξ (t, x).

One can see two parts in dynamic equations (4.8): nonlocal potential term ϕ,νξα,ν
inξµ,νξα,ν. The vortical term describes inﬂuence of the

and local vortical term vµ

12

”frozen” vorticity on the ﬂuid ﬂow. The potential term describes nonlocal interaction
in the ﬂuid connected with the potential ϕ and with the inﬁnite speed of sound. In
the barotropic ﬂuid the speed of sound is ﬁnite, and the potential term describes a
local interaction.

5 Stationary ﬂow of incompressible ﬂuid.

Let us imagine that setting the Cauchy problem, we choose the initial conditions in
such a way that the incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow appears to be stationary, i.e.

∂0ρ = 0,

∂0v = 0

(5.1)

In this case the stream lines are stationary. Let Clebsch potentials ξ2 and ξ3 label
these stream lines. The Clebsch potentials ξ2 and ξ3 can be chosen independent of
time. Dynamic equations (2.13), (2.14), (2.15), (2.17) take the form

v = −ξ1,0 (∇ξ2 × ∇ξ3) ,

∇ξ1 (∇ξ2 × ∇ξ3) = 1

Let us set ξ1,0 = −1. We obtain

v = (∇ξ2 × ∇ξ3) ,

ξ1,0 = −1

The ﬁrst equation (5.4) takes the form

(v∇) ξ1 = 1,

We integrate the second equation (5.6), considering variables ξ2, ξ3 as given functions
of argument x. It can be written in the form

The quantities Ωαβ describe the ﬂuid ﬂow vorticity in the coordinates ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, as
it follows from the relation (5.16), written in the form

∂µvν (x) − ∂νvµ (x) =

∂ξα
∂xµ

∂ξβ
∂xν Ωαβ (ξ)

This relation may interpreted as a transformation of the tensor ∂µvν − ∂νvµ from
the coordinates ξ to coordinates x.

The variables ξ2 and ξ3 do not depend on t, whereas ξ1 is a linear function of t.
Left hand side of (5.16) does not depend on t. It means that the quantities Ωαβ do
not depend on t also. They depend only on ξ2, ξ3, but not on ξ1, because ξ1 depends
on t. Diﬀerentiating (5.15), we obtain

(5.21)

Three independent equations (5.21) carry out the description of the stationary ﬂow
of incompressible ﬂuid in terms of the generalized stream function (GSF) {ξ2, ξ3}.
The velocity v is expressed via GSF by means of the relation (5.7). The variable
s is chosen in such a way, that the inequality (5.10) takes place. For instance, one
can set s = x. Then we obtain from (5.10)

∆ =

∂ (x, ξ2, ξ3)
∂ (x, y, z)

= v1 (x, ξ2, ξ3)

In this case the equations (5.21) has a singular point, when the velocity component
v1 vanishes. At another choice of the variable s the singular point does not appear,
or it appears in other place. It means that the possible singular point is a result of
unsuccessful description, which can be eliminated by a proper choice of the variable
s.

The conventional statement of the stationary ﬂow problem of the incompressible
ﬂuid can be obtained from the dynamic equations (2.12) and (5.1). It has the form

∇v = 0,

∇ × (v∇) v = 0

(5.22)

The ﬁrst equation (5.22) can be solved by introduction of GSF {ξ2, ξ3}. Then the
velocity is expressed by means of (5.7), and we obtain the dynamic equations for
the stationary ﬂow of the incompressible ﬂuid

∇ × (v∇) v = 0,

v = (∇ξ2 × ∇ξ3)

(5.23)

Let us compare two diﬀerent statement of the problem of the stationary ﬂow of
the incompressible ﬂuid. We shall compare equations (5.21) and (5.22). At ﬁrst, we
consider equations (5.22). In the case of the irrotational ﬂow, when

v = ∇ϕ

(5.24)

the second equation (5.22) is satisﬁed identically. The ﬁrst equation (5.22) leads to
the Laplace equation

∇2ϕ = 0
(5.25)
which has a unique solution, provided that the normal derivative (n∇) ϕ is given
on the boundary ∂V of the volume V , where the ﬂuid ﬂow is considered. In other
words, for determination of an unique irrotational ﬂow it is suﬃcient to give the
velocity v on the boundary ∂V . What information is necessary for determination
of the unique rotational ﬂow? It is believed that in the case of the rotational ﬂow

15

the same information is suﬃcient as in the case of the irrotational ﬂow. Why?
Because in the case of the nonstationary ﬂow it is suﬃcient to give the initial velocity
vin (x) in the whole volume V and the velocity vb (t, , x) , x ∈ ∂V on the boundary
∂V . This information is the same for both rotational and irrotational ﬂow. In the
stationary case the determination of the rotational ﬂow needs additional information
as compared with the irrotational ﬂow. It is necessary to give the vorticity Ωαβ on
each stream line. In reality, the vorticity is given also in the case of the stationary
irrotational ﬂow. It is simply equal to zero, and this information is perceived usually
as an absence of information.

Why is it necessary to give the vorticity in addition to the velocity in the sta-
tionary case? Why may we not give the vorticity in the nonstationary case? In
reality, we need to give the vorticity in both cases, but in the nonstationary case the
vorticity is determined by the initial velocity ﬁeld vin (x), given in the whole volume
V . In the stationary case the velocity is given only on the boundary ∂V , and the
vorticity cannot be determined on the basis of this information. In this case we can
determine only one component of the vorticity vector ω = ∇ × v. As a result the
vorticity must be given in addition.

Now we consider the equations (5.21), which contain indeﬁnite functions Ωαβ (ξ1, ξ2).

As we have seen in section 4, the functions gα (ξ), α = 1, 2, 3 contain the complete
information, which is necessary for determination of the unique ﬂuid ﬂow, whereas
initial and boundary conditions for variables ξ do not inﬂuence the ﬂuid ﬂow and may
be taken arbitrarily. In the case of the irrotational ﬂow all functions Ωαβ (ξ1, ξ2) = 0,
and one obtains from (5.21)

(5.26)
Replacing the second equation (5.26) by the equivalent equation ∇v = 0, we reduce
the problem to equations (5.24), (5.25).

v = (∇ξ2 × ∇ξ3)

∇ × v = 0,

In the case of the rotational ﬂow the vorticity Ωαβ is to be given on any stream
line, labeled by ξ2, ξ3. If the ﬂuid ﬂow contains closed stream lines, which do not
cross the boundary ∂V , one cannot determine the vorticity Ωαβ on these stream
lines, giving boundary conditions. In this case one needs an additional information
other than the boundary condition. We can obtain the stationary ﬂow as a result
In this case we are to give initial velocity vin (x) in the
of establishing process.
whole volume V , and the vorticity on the closed stream lines is determined by the
initial velocity vin (x). Using diﬀerent establishing processes, we obtain diﬀerent
stationary ﬂows at the same stationary boundary conditions. Experimenters dealing
with rotating ﬂuid ﬂows know this fact very well.

Equations (5.21) are equations for the generalized stream function (GSF) {ξ2, ξ3}.
These equations are nonlinear. In terms of the variables v, ξ2, ξ3 equations (5.21)
contain terms linear with respect v. Equations (5.21) became to be simple in the
special case, when Ω23 =const and Ω13 = Ω12 = 0. In this case we obtain linear
equations

∇ × v = Ω23v,

∇v = 0,

Ω23 = const

(5.27)

which can be solved without consideration of variables ξ2, ξ3.

dent variables. Sometimes it is useful to have dynamic equations, where indeﬁnite
functions be those of independent variables. Let us transform dynamic equations

Finally, equation (6.5) can be resolved with respect to x1 in the same way, as

the equation (5.9) has been resolved with respect to ξ1. We obtain

as a function of arguments s, x2, x3. In particular, if s = ξ1,

(6.14)

Using relation (6.13) or (6.14), we can eliminate variables x1 and v1 = x1,1 from
equations (6.11). We obtain the system of dynamic equations for variables x2, x3 in
the two-dimensional space of coordinates ξ2, ξ3 with variable ξ1, considered as an
evolutional variable (time).

Equations (6.11), (6.14) are rather complicated, especially because of the equa-
tion (6.14), which contains the operation of transition from independent variables
{ξ1, ξ2, ξ3} to independent variables {ξ1, x2, x3}. Properties of this operation are
investigated slightly. Apparently, this operation is an attribute of incompressible
ﬂuid, because this operation is present in dynamic equations (5.21), written in the
Eulerian coordinates. Indeﬁnite functions Ωαβ describing vorticity are functions of
independent variables in the equations (6.11), whereas they are functions of depen-
dent variables in equations (5.21). From this viewpoint the equations (6.11) are
more convenient for investigation of vortical ﬂows.

7 Concluding remarks

We have seen that the statement of the ﬂow problem is more complicated for sta-
tionary ﬂows, than for nonstationary ones, although dynamic equations for nonsta-
tionary ﬂows are more complicated. Stationary boundary conditions do not destine
a unique stationary ﬂow, even if they determine vorticity on any stream line crossing
the boundary of the considered ﬂow region. There is a hope that the description
of stationary ﬂows of the ideal ﬂuid may appear to be more eﬀective in Lagrangian
coordinates.

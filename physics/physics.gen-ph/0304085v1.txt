not the Lorentz Transformations. Cliﬀord Algebra Formalism

In this paper it is exactly proved by using the Cliﬀord algebra formalism
that the standard transformations of the three-dimensional (3D) vectors of
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B are not the Lorentz transformations
of well-deﬁned quantities from the 4D spacetime but the ’apparent’ transfor-
mations of the 3D quantities. Thence the usual Maxwell equations with the
3D E and B are not in agreement with special relativity. The 1-vectors E
and B, as well-deﬁned 4D quantities, are introduced instead of ill-deﬁned 3D
E and B.

1. INTRODUCTION

It is generally accepted by physics community that there is an agree-
ment between the classical electromagnetism and the special relativity (SR).
Such opinion is prevailing in physics already from the Einstein ﬁrst paper
on SR [1]. The standard transformations of the 3D vectors of the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B respectively, are ﬁrst derived by Lorentz [2]
and independently by Einstein [1], and subsequently quoted in almost every
textbook and paper on relativistic electrodynamics. They are considered to
be the Lorentz transformations (LT) of these vectors, see, e.g., [1-3]. The
same opinion holds in all usual Cliﬀord algebra formulations of the classical
electromagnetism, e.g., the formulations with Cliﬀord multivectors [4-6]. The
usual Maxwell equations (ME) with the 3D vectors E and B are assumed
to be physically equivalent to the ﬁeld equations (FE) expressed in terms
of the Faraday bivector ﬁeld F in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism (CAF) (or
the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F ab in the tensor formalism (TF)). In this
paper it will be exactly proved that the above mentioned standard trans-
formations of E and B (see eq. (12) below) are not relativistically correct
transformations in the 4D spacetime; they are not the LT of the 3D E and

1

B. Consequently the usual ME with E and B and the FE with the F ﬁeld
are not physically equivalent. The correct LT (the active ones) of the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds are given by the relations (8) and (9) below. In the CAF
(as in the TF) one deals either with 4D quantities that are deﬁned with-
out reference frames, e.g., Cliﬀord multivector F (the abstract tensor F ab)
or, when some basis has been introduced, with coordinate-based geometric
quantity (CBGQ) that comprises both components and a basis. The SR that
exclusively deals with quantities deﬁned without reference frames or, equiv-
alently, with CBGQs, can be called the invariant SR (ISR). The reason for
this name is that upon the passive LT any CBGQ remains unchanged. The
invariance of some 4D CBGQ upon the passive LT reﬂects the fact that such
mathematical, invariant, geometric 4D quantity represents the same physical
object for relatively moving observers. It is taken in the ISR that such 4D
geometric quantities are well-deﬁned not only mathematically but also exper-
imentally, as measurable quantities with real physical meaning. Thus they do
have an independent physical reality. The ISR is discussed in [7] in the CAF
and in [8,9] in the TF. It is explicitly shown in [9] that the true agreement
with experiments that test SR exists when the theory deals with well-deﬁned
4D quantities, i.e., the quantities that are invariant upon the passive LT. The
usual standard transformations of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (the trans-
formations (10), (11) and (12) below) are typical examples of the ‘apparent’
transformations (AT) that are ﬁrst discussed in [10] and [11]. The AT of
the spatial distances (the Lorentz contraction) and the temporal distances
(the dilatation of time) are elaborated in detail in [8] and [9] (see also [12]),
and in [8] I have also discussed in the TF the AT of the 3D vectors E and
B. The AT relate, in fact, the quantities from ’3+1’ space and time (spatial
and temporal distances and 3D vectors E and B) and not well-deﬁned 4D
quantities. But, in contrast to the LT of well-deﬁned 4D quantities, the AT
do not refer to the same physical object for relatively moving observers. In
this paper it will be also shown that in the 4D spacetime the well-deﬁned
4D quantities, the 1-vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B (see
(13)) in the CAF (as in [7]), have to be introduced instead of ill-deﬁned 3D
vectors E and B. The same proof is already presented in the TF in [13].

2. THE γ0 - SPLIT AND THE USUAL EXPRESSIONS FOR E
AND B IN THE γ0 - FRAME

2.1. A Brief Summary of Geometric Algebra

2

First we provide a brief summary of Cliﬀord algebra with multivectors
(see, e.g., [4 − 6]). We write Cliﬀord vectors in lower case (a) and general
multivectors (Cliﬀord aggregate) in upper case (A). The space of multi-
vectors is graded and multivectors containing elements of a single grade,
r, are termed homogeneous and written Ar. The geometric (Cliﬀord) prod-
uct is written by simply juxtaposing multivectors AB. A basic operation
on multivectors is the degree projection hAir which selects from the mul-
tivector A its r− vector part (0 = scalar, 1 = vector, 2 = bivector ....).
We write the scalar (grade-0) part simply as hAi . The geometric product
of a grade-r multivector Ar with a grade-s multivector Bs decomposes into
ArBs = hABi r+s + hABi r+s−2 ...+ hABi |r−s| . The inner and outer (or exte-
rior) products are the lowest-grade and the highest-grade terms respectively
of the above series Ar · Bs ≡ hABi |r−s| , and Ar ∧ Bs ≡ hABi r+s . For vec-
tors a and b we have ab = a · b + a ∧ b, where a · b ≡ (1/2)(ab + ba), and
a ∧ b ≡ (1/2)(ab − ba). Reversion is an invariant kind of conjugation, which
a = a, for any vector a, and it reverses the order of
is deﬁned by
e
vectors in any given expression. Any multivector A is a geometric 4D quan-
tity deﬁned without reference frame. When some basis has been introduced
A can be written as a coordinate-based geometric quantity (CBGQ) compris-
ing both components and a basis. Usually, e.g., [4 − 6], one introduces the
standard basis. The generators of the spacetime algebra (STA) are taken to
be four basis vectors {γµ} , µ = 0...3, satisfying γµ ·γν = ηµν = diag(+−−−).
This basis is a right-handed orthonormal frame of vectors in the Minkowski
spacetime M 4 with γ0 in the forward light cone. The γk (k = 1, 2, 3) are
spacelike vectors. This algebra is often called the Dirac algebra D and the
elements of D are called d−numbers. The γµ generate by multiplication a
complete basis, the standard basis, for STA: 1, γµ, γµ ∧ γν, γµγ5,γ5 (16 inde-
pendent elements). γ5 is the pseudoscalar for the frame {γµ} .

AB =
g

A,
e

e

We remark that the standard basis corresponds, in fact, to the speciﬁc
system of coordinates (SC), i.e., to Einstein’s system of coordinates (ESC).
In the ESC the Einstein synchronization [1] of distant clocks and Cartesian
space coordinates xi are used in the chosen inertial frame of reference (IFR).
However diﬀerent SC of an IFR are allowed and they are all equivalent in the
description of physical phenomena. For example, in [8] two very diﬀerent,
but completely equivalent SC, the ESC and ”radio” (”r”) SC, are exposed
and exploited throughout the paper. The CBGQs representing some 4D
physical quantity in diﬀerent relatively moving IFRs, or in diﬀerent SC in

3

the chosen IFR, are all mathematically equal and thus they are the same
quantity for diﬀerent observers, or in diﬀerent SC. Then, e.g., the position
1-vector x (a geometric quantity) can be decomposed in the S and S′ frames
and in the standard basis {γµ} as x = xµγµ = x′µγ′
µ. The primed quantities
are the Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones.
In such interpretation
the LT are considered as passive transformations; both the components and
the basis vectors are transformed but the whole geometric quantity remains
unchanged. Thus we see that under the passive LT a well-deﬁned quantity
on the 4D spacetime, i.e., a CBGQ, is an invariant quantity. As already
said in the Introduction the SR that exclusively deals with such quantities
deﬁned without reference frames or, equivalently, with CBGQs, is called the
ISR and it is considered in the TF in [8,9].

In the usual CAF [4 − 6] instead of working only with such observer
independent quantities one introduces a space-time split and the relative
vectors. By singling out a particular time-like direction γ0 we can get a
unique mapping of spacetime into the even subalgebra of STA. For each event
x this mapping is speciﬁed by xγ0 = ct + x,
ct = x · γ0, x = x ∧ γ0. The set
of all position vectors x is the 3D position space of the observer γ0 and it is
designated by P 3. The elements of P 3 are called the relative vectors (relative
to γ0) and they will be designated in boldface. The explicit appearance of
γ0 implies that the space-time split is observer dependent. If we consider the
position 1-vector x in another relatively moving IFR S′ (characterized by γ′
0)
then the space-time split in S′ and in the ESC is xγ′
0 = ct′ + x′. This xγ′
0
is not obtained by the LT from xγ0. (The hypersurface t′ = const. is not
connected in any way with the hypersurface t = const.) Thence the spatial
and the temporal components (x, t) of some geometric 4D quantity (x) (and
thus the relative vectors as well) are not physically well-deﬁned quantities.
Only their union is physically well-deﬁned quantity in the 4D spacetime from
the ISR viewpoint.

2.2. The γ0 - Split and the Usual Expressions for E and B in the γ0
- Frame

Let us see now how the space-time split is introduced in the usual CAF
[4,5] of the electromagnetism. The bivector ﬁeld F is expressed in terms
of the sum of a relative vector E and a relative bivector γ5B by making a

4

space-time split in the γ0 - frame

F = EH + cγ5BH, EH = (F · γ0)γ0 = (1/2)(F − γ0F γ0),

γ5BH = (F ∧ γ0)γ0 = (1/2c)(F + γ0F γ0).

(1)

(The subscript ’H’ is for - Hestenes.) Both EH and BH are, in fact, bivectors.
Similarly in [6] F is decomposed in terms of 1-vector EJ and a bivector BJ
(the subscript ’J’ is for - Jancewicz) as

F = γ0 ∧ EJ − cBJ, EJ = F · γ0, BJ = −(1/2c)(F + γ0F γ0).

(2)

Instead of to use EH, BH or EJ , BJ we shall deal with simpler but completely
equivalent expressions in the γ0 - frame, i.e., with 1-vectors that will be
denoted as Ef and Bf . Then

F = Ef ∧ γ0 + c(γ5Bf ) · γ0,
Ef = F · γ0, Bf = −(1/c)γ5(F ∧ γ0).

All these quantities can be written as CBGQs in the standard basis {γµ} .
Thus

F = (1/2)F µνγµ ∧ γν = F 0kγ0 ∧ γk + (1/2)F klγk ∧ γl,

k, l = 1, 2, 3.

(4)

Ef = Eµ
Bf = Bµ

f γµ = 0γ0 + F k0γk,
f γµ = 0γ0 + (−1/2c)ε0kliFklγi.

We see from (4) and (5) that the components of F in the {γµ} basis (i.e., in
the ESC) give rise to the tensor (components) F µν = γν ·(γµ·F ) = (γν ∧γµ)·F,
which, written out as a matrix, has entries

Ei

f = F i0, Bi

f = (−1/2c)ε0kliFkl.

The relation (6) is nothing else than the standard identiﬁcation of the com-
ponents F µν with the components of the 3D vectors E and B, see, e.g., [3]. It
is worth noting that all expressions with γ0 (3) ((1) or (2)) actually refer to
the 3D subspace orthogonal to the speciﬁc timelike direction γ0. Really it can
be easily checked that Ef ·γ0 = Bf ·γ0 = 0, which means that they are orthog-
onal to γ0; Ef and Bf do not have the temporal components E0
f = 0

f = B0

(the same holds for EH, BH or EJ, BJ). These results (6) are quoted in nu-
merous textbooks and papers treating relativistic electrodynamics, see, e.g.,
[3]. Actually in the usual covariant approaches, e.g., [3], one forgets about
f and B0
temporal components E0
f and simply makes the identiﬁcation of six
independent components of F µν with three components Ei
f and three com-
ponents Bi
f according to (6). Since in SR we work with the 4D spacetime
the mapping between some components of F µν and the components of the
3D vectors E and B is mathematically better founded by the relations (5)
than by their simple identiﬁcation. Note that the whole procedure is made
in an IFR with the ESC. In another SC that is diﬀerent than the ESC, e.g.,
diﬀering in the chosen synchronization (as it is the ’r’ synchronization con-
sidered in [8]), the identiﬁcation of Ei
f ),
is impossible and meaningless.

3. THE PROOF THAT THE STANDARD TRANSFORMATIONS
OF E AND B ARE NOT THE LT

3.1. The Active LT of the Electric and Magnetic Fields

Let us now explicitly show that the usual transformations of the 3D E and
B are not relativistically correct, i.e., they are not the LT of quantities that
are well-deﬁned on the 4D spacetime. First we ﬁnd the correct expressions
for the LT (the active ones) of Ef and Bf . In the usual CAF, e.g., [4 − 6], the
LT are considered as active transformations; the components of, e.g., some 1-
vector relative to a given IFR (with the standard basis {γµ}) are transformed
into the components of a new 1-vector relative to the same frame (the basis
{γµ} is not changed). Furthermore the LT are described with rotors R,
µγµ. But every rotor in
R
spacetime can be written in terms of a bivector as R = eθ/2. For boosts in
arbitrary direction

R = 1, in the usual way as p → p′ = Rp
e

R = p′

R = eθ/2 = (1 + γ + γβγ0n)/(2(1 + γ))1/2,

(7)

θ = αγ0n, β is the scalar velocity in units of c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2, or in
terms of an ‘angle’ α we have tanh α = β, cosh α = γ, sinh α = βγ, and
n is not the basis vector but any unit space-like vector orthogonal to γ0;
eθ = cosh α + γ0n sinh α. One can also express the relationship between the
two relatively moving frames S and S′ in terms of rotor as γ′
R. For
boosts in the direction γ1 the rotor R is given by the relation (7) with γ1

µ = Rγµ e

replacing n (all in the standard basis {γµ}). Then using (5) the transformed

is important to note that E′
f are not orthogonal to γ0, i.e., they do
have the temporal components 6= 0. They do not belong to the same 3D
subspace as Ef and Bf , but they are in the 4D spacetime spanned by the
whole standard basis {γµ}. The relations (8) and (9) imply that the space-
time split in the γ0 - system is not possible for the transformed F ′ = RF

i.e., F ′ cannot be decomposed into E′
f as F is decomposed in the

f (Bµ
the components Eµ
f ) from (5) transform upon the active LT again to the
components E′µ
f (B′µ
f ) from (8) ((9)); there is no mixing of components; by
the active LT Ef transforms to E′
f . Actually, as we said, this
is the way in which every 1-vector transforms upon the active LT.

3.2. The Standard Transformations of the Electric and Magnetic
Fields

st and B′

However the standard transformations for E′

st (the subscript - st
- is for - standard) are derived wrongly assuming that the quantities obtained
by the active LT of Ef and Bf are again in the 3D subspace of the γ0 -
observer. This means that it is wrongly assumed in all standard derivations,
e.g., in the CAF [4-6] (and in the tensor formalism [3] as well), that one
can again perform the same identiﬁcation of the transformed components
F ′µν with the components of the 3D E′ and B′. Thus it is taken in standard
derivations that for the transformed E′
st = 0,
i.e., that E′
st · γ0 = 0 as for Ef and Bf . Thence, in contrast to
the correct LT of Ef and Bf , (8) and (9) respectively, it is taken in standard

As can be seen from (10), (11) and (12) the transformations for E′i
st. and B′i
st.
are exactly the standard transformations of components of the 3D vectors E
and B that are quoted in almost every textbook and paper on relativistic
electrodynamics including [1] and [3]. These relations are explicitly derived
and given in the CAF, e.g., in [4], Space-Time Algebra (eq. (18.22)), New
Foundations for Classical Mechanics (Ch. 9 eqs. (3.51a,b)) and in [6] (Ch. 7
eqs. (20a,b)). Notice that, in contrast to the active LT (8) and (9), according
to the standard transformations (10) and (11) (i.e., (12)) the transformed
components E′i
st are expressed by the mixture of components Ei
f , and
the same holds for B′i
In all previous treatments of SR, e.g., [4-6] (and
st.
st. and B′i
[1-3]) the transformations for E′i
st. are considered to be the LT of
the 3D electric and magnetic ﬁelds. However our analysis shows that the
transformations for E′i
st. (12) are derived from the relativistically
incorrect transformations (10) and (11), which are not the LT; the LT are
given by the relations (8) and (9).

st. and B′i

f and Bi

The same results can be obtained with the passive LT, either by using
the expression for the LT that is independent of the chosen SC (such one
as in [7]), or by using the standard expressions for the LT in the ESC from
[3]. The passive LT transform always the whole 4D quantity, basis and
components, leaving the whole quantity unchanged. Thus under the passive
LT the ﬁeld bivector F as well-deﬁned 4D quantity remains unchanged, i.e.,
F = (1/2)F µνγµ ∧ γν = (1/2)F ′µνγ′
ν (all primed quantities are the
Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones). In the same way it holds that, e.g.,
Eµ
µ. The invariance of some 4D CBGQ upon the passive LT is the

f γµ = E′µ

µ ∧ γ′

f γ′

st γ′

st.γ′

crucial requirement that must be satisﬁed by any well-deﬁned 4D quantity.
It reﬂects the fact that such mathematical, invariant, geometric 4D quantity
represents the same physical object for relatively moving observers. The use
of CBGQs enables us to have clearly and correctly deﬁned the concept of
sameness of a physical system for diﬀerent observers. Thus such quantity
that does not change upon the passive LT does have an independent physical
reality, both theoretically and experimentally.
However it can be easily shown that Eµ

f γµ 6= E′µ
µ. This means that, e.g.,
Eµ
µ are not the same quantity for observers in S and S′. As far as
relativity is concerned the quantities, e.g., Eµ
µ, are not related to
one another. Their identiﬁcation is the typical case of mistaken identity. The
fact that they are measured by two observers (γ0 - and γ′
0 - observers) does
not mean that relativity has something to do with the problem. The reason
is that observers in the γ0 - system and in the γ′
0 - system are not looking at
the same physical object but at two diﬀerent objects. Every observer makes
measurement on its own object and such measurements are not related by
the LT. Thus from the point of view of the SR the transformations for E′i
st.
and B′i
st. (12) are not the LT of some well-deﬁned 4D quantities. Therefore,
contrary to the general belief, it is not true from SR viewpoint that, e.g.,
[3] , Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics, Sec. 11.10: ”A purely electric or
magnetic ﬁeld in one coordinate system will appear as a mixture of electric
and magnetic ﬁelds in another coordinate frame.”; or that [5], Handout 10 in
Physical Applications of Geometric Algebra: ”Observers in relative motion
see diﬀerent ﬁelds.” This is also exactly proved in the tensor formalism in
[13].

st.γ′

Both the transformations (10), (11) and the transformations (12) for E′i
st.
and B′i
st. (i.e., for the 3D vectors E and B) are typical examples of the AT
that are ﬁrst discussed in [10] and [11]. The AT of the spatial distances
(the Lorentz contraction) and the temporal distances (the dilatation of time)
are elaborated in detail in [8] and [9] (see also [12]), and in [8] I have also
discussed the AT of the 3D vectors E and B. The AT relate, in fact, the
quantities from ’3+1’ space and time (spatial and temporal distances and 3D
vectors E and B) and not well-deﬁned 4D quantities. As shown in [8] two
synchronously (for the observer) determined spatial lengths correspond to
two diﬀerent 4D quantities; two temporal distances connected by the relation
for the dilatation of time also correspond to two diﬀerent 4D quantities in
two relatively moving 4D IFRs, see in [8] Figs. 3. and 4. that refer to the

9

Lorentz contraction and the dilatation of time respectively and compare them
with Figs. 1. and 2. that refer to well-deﬁned 4D quantities, the spacetime
lengths for a moving rod and a moving clock respectively. Since the spatial
length, the temporal distance and the 3D vectors E and B are diﬀerent for
diﬀerent observers in the 4D spacetime they do not have an independent
physical reality. It is explicitly shown in [9] that the true agreement with
experiments that test SR exists when the theory deals with well-deﬁned 4D
quantities, i.e., the quantities that are invariant upon the passive LT; they
do not change for diﬀerent observers in the 4D spacetime.

These results (both with the active and the passive LT) entail that the
standard transformations of the 3D vectors E and B are not mathemati-
cally correct in the 4D spacetime, which means that the 3D vectors E and B
themselves are not correctly deﬁned quantities from the SR viewpoint. Con-
sequently the usual ME with 3D E and B are not in agreement with SR and
they are not physically equivalent with the relativistically correct FE with F
(e.g., eq. (8.1) in [4], Space-Time Algebra). The same conclusion is achieved
in the tensor formalism in [13] .

4. THE 1-VECTORS OF THE ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC
FIELDS E AND B

In order to have the electric and magnetic ﬁelds deﬁned without reference
frames, i.e., independent of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen
system of coordinates in it, one has to replace γ0 (the velocity in units of
c of an observer at rest in the γ0-system) in the relation (3) (and (1), (2)
as well) with v. The velocity v and all other quantities entering into the
relations (3) (and (1), (2) as well), but with v replacing γ0, are then deﬁned
without reference frames. v characterizes some general observer. We can say,
as in TF [14], that v is the velocity (1-vector) of a family of observers who
measures E and B ﬁelds. With such replacement the relation (3) becomes

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (e5B) · v,
E = (1/c)F · v, B = −(1/c2)e5(F ∧ v),

(13)

and it holds that E · v = B · v = 0. Of course the relations for E and B
(13) are independent of the chosen observer; i.e., they hold for any observer.
When some reference frame is chosen with the ESC in it and when v is spec-
iﬁed to be in the time direction in that frame, i.e., v = cγ0, then all results

10

f and Bi

f (of Eµ

f and B′µ

of the classical electromagnetism are recovered in that frame. Namely we
can always select a particular - but otherwise arbitrary - IFR S, the frame
of our ’ﬁducial’ observers in which v = cγ0 and consequently the temporal
components of Eµ
f are zero (the subscript ’f ’ is for ’ﬁducial’). Then
in that frame the usual ME for the spatial components Ei
f and
Bµ
f ) will be fulﬁlled. As a consequence the usual ME can explain all exper-
iments that are performed in one reference frame. Thus the correspondence
principle is simply and naturally satisﬁed. However as shown above the tem-
poral components of E′µ
f are not zero; (8) and (9) are relativistically
correct, but it is not the case with (10) and (11). This means that the usual
ME cannot be used for the explanation of any experiment that test SR, i.e.,
in which relatively moving observers have to compare their data obtained
by measurements on the same physical object. However, in contrast to the
description of the electromagnetism with the 3D E and B, the description
with E and B is correct not only in that frame but in all other relatively
moving frames and it holds for any permissible choice of coordinates. It is
worth to note that the relations (13) are not the deﬁnitions of E and B but
they are the relations that connect two equivalent formulations of electro-
dynamics, the standard formulations with the F ﬁeld and the new one with
the E and B ﬁelds. Every of these formulations is an independent, complete
and consistent formulation. For more detail see [7] where four equivalent
formulations are presented, the F and E, B - formulations and two new
additional formulations with real and complex combinations of E and B
ﬁelds. All four formulations are given in terms of quantities that are deﬁned
without reference frames. Note however that in the E, B - formulation of
electrodynamics in [7] the expression for the stress-energy vector T (v) and
all quantities derived from T (v) are written for the special case when v, the
velocity of observers who measure E and B ﬁelds is v = cn, where n is the
unit normal to a hypersurface through which the ﬂow of energy-momentum
(T (n)) is calculated. The more general case with v 6= n will be reported
elsewhere. We have not mentioned some other references that refer to the
CAF and its application to the electrodynamics as are, e.g., [15]. The reason
is that they use the CAF with spinors but, of course, they also erroneously
consider that the standard transformations of the 3D E and B (12) are the
LT of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

5. CONCLUSIONS

11

The whole consideration explicitly shows that the 3D quantities E and
B, their transformations and the equations with them are ill-deﬁned in the
4D spacetime. More generally, the 3D quantities do not have an independent
physical reality in the 4D spacetime. Contrary to the general belief we ﬁnd
that it is not true from the SR viewpoint that observers in relative motion see
diﬀerent ﬁelds; the transformations (10), (11) and (12) are not relativistically
correct. According to the relativistically correct transformations, the LT (8)
and (9), the electric ﬁeld transforms only to the electric ﬁeld and the same
holds for the magnetic ﬁeld. Thence the relativistically correct physics must
be formulated with 4D quantities that are deﬁned without reference frames,
or by the 4D CBGQs, e.g., as in [7] in the CAF with multivectors, or [8,9] in
the TF. The principle of relativity is automatically included in such theory
with well-deﬁned 4D quantities, while in the standard approach to SR [1] it
is postulated outside the mathematical formulation of the theory. The com-
parison with experiments from [9] (and [7]) reveals that the true agreement
with experiments that test SR can be achieved when such well-deﬁned 4D
quantities are considered.

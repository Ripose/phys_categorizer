Abstract

Two recent ﬁndings necessitate a closer look at the existing stan-
dard models of Particle Physics and Cosmology. These are the dis-
covery of Neutrino oscillation, and hence a non zero mass on the one
hand and, on the other, observations of distant supernovae which in-
dicate that contrary to popular belief, the universe would continue to
expand for ever, possibly accelerating in the process. In this paper it
is pointed out that relatively recent studies which indicate a stochas-
tic, quantum vacuum underpinning and a fractal structure for space
time, reconcile both of the recent observations, harmoniously.

1 Introduction

In the recent years, there have been two signiﬁcant ﬁndings which necessitate
a closer look at the existing standard models of Particle Physics and Cosmol-
ogy. The ﬁrst is the Superkamiokande experiment[1] which demonstrates a
neutrino oscillation and therefore a non zero mass, whereas, strictly going by
the standard model, the neutrino should have zero mass. The other ﬁnding
based on distant supernovae observations[2, 3, 4] is that the universe will
continue to expand without deceleration and infact possibly accelerating in
the process.
We will now demonstrate how a recent model of fractal, quantized space time

versity of Hyderabad, 1998.

arising from the underpinning of a quantum vaccuum or Zero Point Field,
reconciles both the above facts, in addition to being in agreement with other
experimental and observational data.

2 Neutrino Mass

According to a recent model, elementary particles, typically leptons, can be
treated as, what may be called Quantum Mechanical Black Holes (QMBH)[5,
6, 7, 8, 9], which share certain features of Black Holes and also certain Quan-
tum Mechanical characteristics. Essentially they are bounded by the Comp-
ton wavelength within which non local or negative energy phenomena occur,
these manifesting themselves as the Zitterbewegung of the electron. These
Quantum Mechanical Black Holes are created out of the background Zero
Point Field and this leads to a consistent cosmology, wherein using N, the
number of particles in the universe as the only large scale parameter, one
could deduce from the theory, Hubble’s law, the Hubble’s constant, the ra-
dius, mass, and age of the universe and features like the hitherto inexplicable
relation between the pion mass and the Hubble constant[5]. The model also
predicts an ever expanding universe, as recent observations do conﬁrm.
Within this framework, it was pointed out that the neutrino would be a
massless and charge less version of the electron and it was deduced that it
would be lefthanded, because one would everywhere encounter the psuedo
spinorial (”negative energy”) components of the Dirac spinor, by virtue of the
fact that its Compton wavelength is inﬁnite (in practise very large). Based
on these considerations we will now argue that the neutrino would exhibit
an anomalous Bosonic behaviour which could provide a clue to the neutrino
mass.
As detailed in [6] the Fermionic behaviour is due to the non local or Zitterbe-
wegung eﬀects within the Compton wavelength eﬀectively showing up as the
well known negative energy components of the Dirac spinor which dominate
within while positive energy components predominate outside leading to a
doubly connected space or equivalently the spinorial or Fermionic behaviour.
In the absence of the Compton wavelength boundary, that is when we en-
counter only positive energy or only negative energy solutions, the particle
would not exhibit the double valued spinorial or Fermionic behaviour: It
would have an anomalous anyonic behaviour.

2

Indeed, the three dimensionality of space arises from the spinorial behaviour
outside the Compton wavelength[10]. At the Compton wavelength, this dis-
appears and we should encounter lower dimensions. As is well known[11] the
low dimensional Dirac equation has like the neutrino, only two components
corresponding to only one sign of the energy, displays handedness and has
no invariant mass. The neutrino shows up as a fractal entity.
Ofcourse the above model strictly speaking is for the case of an isolated non
interacting particle. As neutrinos interact through the weak or gravitational
forces, both of which are weak, the conclusion would still be approximately
valid particularly for neutrinos which are not in bound states.
We will now justify the above conclusion from other standpoints: Let us ﬁrst
examine why Fermi-Dirac statistics is required in the Quantum Field Theo-
retic treatment of a Fermion satisfying the Dirac equation. The Dirac spinor
has four components and there are four independent solutions corresponding
to positive and negative energies and spin up and down. It is well known that
[12] in general the wave function expansion of the Fermion should include
solutions of both signs of energy:

ψ(~x, t) = N Z d3pX±s

[b(p, s)u(p, s)exp(−ıpµxµ/¯h)
+d∗(p, s)v(p, s)exp(+ıpµxµ/¯h)

(1)

where N is a normalization constant for ensuring unit probability.
In Quantum Field Theory, the coeﬃcients become creation and annihilation
operators while bb+ and dd+ become the particle number operators with eigen
values 1 or 0 only. The Hamiltonian is now given by[13]:

H = X±s Z d3pEp[b+(p, s)b(p, s) − d(p, s)d+(p, s)]

(2)

As can be seen from (2), the Hamiltonian is not positive deﬁnite and it is this
circumstance which necessitates the Fermi-Dirac statistics. In the absence
of Fermi-Dirac statistics, the negative energy states are not saturated in
the Hole Theory sense so that the ground state would have arbitrarily large
negative energy, which is unacceptable. However Fermi-Dirac statistics and
the anti commutators implied by it prevent this from happening.
From the above, it follows that as only one sign of energy is encountered for
the v, we need not take recourse to Fermi-Dirac statistics.

3

We will now show from an alternative view point also that for the neutrino,
the positive and negative solutions are delinked so that we do not need the
negative solutions in (1) or (2) and there is no need to invoke Fermi-Dirac
statistics.
The neutrino is described by the two component Weyl equation[14]:

ı¯h

∂ψ
∂t

= ı¯hc~σ · ~∆ψ(x)

(3)

It is well known that this is equivalent to a massless Dirac particle satisfying
the following condition:

Γ5ψ = −ψ

We now observe that in the case of a massive Dirac particle, if we work only
with positive solutions for example, the current or expectation value of the
velocity operator c~α is given by (ref.[12]),

J + =< cα >=<

c2~p
E

> + =< vgp > +

(4)

in an obvious notation.
(4) leads to a contradiction: On the one hand the eigen values of c~α are ±c.
On the other hand we require, < vgp >< 1.
To put it simply, working only with positive solutions, the Dirac particle
should have the velocity c and so zero mass. This contradiction is solved by
including the negative solutions also in the description of the particle. This
infact is the starting point for (1) above.
In the case of mass less neutrinos however, there is no contradiction because
they do indeed move with the velocity of light. So we need not consider the
negative energy solutions and need work only with the positive solutions.
There is another way to see this. Firstly, as in the case of massive Dirac par-
ticles, let us consider the packet (1) with both positive and negative solutions
for the neutrino. Taking the z axis along the ~p direction for simplicity, the
acceptable positive and negative Dirac spinors subject to the above stated
condition are

v = 


The expression for the current is now given by,

[|b(p, s)|2 + |d(p, s)|2]

J z = Z d3p(X±s

b(−p, s′)d(p, s) − ¯v(p, s′)σ30u(−p, s)


(5)

(7)

Using the expressions for u and v it can easily be seen that in (5) the cross
(or Zitterbewegung) term disappears.
Thus the positive and negative solutions stand delinked in contrast to the
case of massive particles, and we need work only with positive solutions (or
only with negative solutions) in (1).
Finally this can also be seen in yet another way. As is known (ref.[14]), we
can apply a Foldy-Wothuysen transformation to the mass less Dirac equation
to eliminate the ”odd” operators which mix the components of the spinors
representing the positive and negative solutions.
The result is the Hamiltonian,

H ′ = Γ◦pc

(6)

Infact in (6) the positive and negative solutions stand delinked. In the case
of massive particles however, we would have obtained instead,

H ′ = Γ◦q(p2c2 + m0c4)

and as is well known, it is the square root operator on the right which gives
rise to the ”odd” operators, the negative solutions and the Dirac spinors.
Infact this is the problem of linearizing the relativistic Hamiltonian and is
the starting point for the Dirac equation.
Thus in the case of mass less Dirac particles, we need work only with solutions
of one sign in (1) and (2). The equation (2) now becomes,

H = X±s Z d3pEp[b+(p, s)b(p, s)]

(8)

As can be seen from (8) there is no need to invoke Fermi-Dirac statistics now.
The occupation number bb+ can now be arbitrary because the question of

5

a ground state with arbitrarily large energy of opposite sign does not arise.
That is, the neutrinos obey anomalous statistics.
In a rough way, this could have been anticipated. This is because the Hamil-
tonian for a mass less particle, be it a Boson or a Fermion, is given by

H = pc

Substitution of the usual operators for H and p yields an equation in which
the wave function ψ is a scalar corresponding to a Bosonic particle.
According to the spin-statistics connection, microscopic causality is incom-
patible with quantization of Bosonic ﬁelds using anti-commutators andr Fermi
ﬁelds using commutators[13]. But it can be shown that this does not apply
when the mass of the Fermion vanishes.
In the case of Fermionic ﬁelds, the contradiction with microscopic causality
arises because the symmetric propogator, the Lorentz invariant function,

∆1(x − x′) ≡ Z

d3k

(2π)33ωk

[e−ık.(x−x′) + eık.(x−x′)]

does not vanish for space like intervals (x − x′)2 < 0, where the vacuum
expectation value of the commutator is given by the spectral representation,

S1(x−x′) ≡ ı < 0|[ψα(x), ψβ(x′)]|0 >= −Z dM 2[ıρ1(M 2)∆x+ρ2(M 2)]αβ∆1(x−x′)
Outside the light cone, r > |t|, where r ≡ |~x − ~x′| and t ≡ |x0 − x′
given by,

0|, ∆1 is

∆1(x′ − x) = −

2π2r

where the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind, K0 is given by,

K0(mx) = Z ∞

2 Z ∞
(cf.[15]). In our case, x ≡ √r2 − t2, and we have,

As we are considering massless neutrinos, going to the limit as m → 0, we
get, |Ltm→0∆1(x − x′)| = |(const.).Ltm→0
x . That is, as

−∞ sinxydy| < 0(1)

6

the Compton wavelength for the neutrino is inﬁnite (or very large), so is |x|
and we have |∆1| << 1. So the invariant ∆1 function nearly vanishes every-
where except on the light cone x = 0, which is exactly what is required. So,
the spin-statistics theorem or microscopic causality is not violated for the
mass less neutrinos when commutators are used.
The fact that the ideally, massless, spin half neutrino obeys anomalous statis-
tics could have interesting implications. For, given an equilibrium collection
of neutrinos, we should have if we use the Bose-Einstein statistics[16].

(10)

where P, V and U denote the pressure, volume and energy of the collection.
We also have, P V αNkT, N and T denoting the number of particles and tem-
perature respectively.
On the other hand for a ﬁxed temperature and number of neutrinos, com-
parison of (9) and (10) shows that the eﬀective energy U ′ of the neutrinos
would be twice the expected energy U. That is in eﬀect the neutrino acquires
a rest mass m. It can easily be shown from the above that,

k ≤≈

√3T

(11)

That is for cold background neutrinos m is about a thousandth of an ev at
the present background temperature of about 2◦K:
10−9me ≤ m ≤ 10−8me

(12)

This can be conﬁrmed, alternatively, as follows. As pointed out by Hayakawa,
the balance of the gravitational force and the Fermi energy of these cold
background neutrinos, gives[17],

GNm2

N 2/3¯h2

(13)

where N is the number of neutrinos.
Further as in the Kerr-Newman Black Hole formulation equating (13) with
the energy of the neutrino, mc2 we immediately deduce

m ≈ 10−8me

7

It also follows that N ∼ 1090, which is
which agrees with (11) and (12).
correct. Moreover equating this energy of the quantum mechanical black
hole to kT , we get (cf.also (11))

T ∼ 1◦K,

which is the correct cosmic background temperature.
Alternatively, using (11) and (12) we get from (13), a background radiation
of a few millimeters wavelength, as required.
So we obtain not only the correct mass and the number of the neutrinos, but
also the correct cosmic background temperature, at one stroke.
Indeed the above mass of the neutrino was predicted earlier[18].

3 Cosmology

The above model of quantized space time ties up with the model of ﬂuctua-
tional cosmology discussed in several papers[8].
We observe that the ZPF leads to divergences in QFT[19] if no large fre-
quency cut oﬀ is arbitrarily prescribed, e.g. the Compton wavelength. We
argue that it is these ﬂuctuations within the Compton wavelength and in
time intervals ∼ ¯h/mc2, which create the particles. Thus choosing the pion
as a typical particle, we get[19, 5],

(Energy density of ZPF)Xl3 = mc2

(14)

Using the fact there are N ∼ 1080 such particles in the Universe, we get,

Nm = M

(15)

where M is the mass of the universe.
We equate the gravitational potential energy of the pion in a three dimen-
sional isotropic sphere of pions of radius R, the radius of the universe, with
the rest energy of the pion, to get,

R =

GM
c2

(16)

where M can be obtained from (15).
We now use the fact that the ﬂuctuation in the particle number is of the order

8

√N[17, 16, 5], while a typical time interval for the ﬂuctuations is ∼ ¯h/mc2

as seen above. This leads to the relation[5]
√N

T =

¯h
mc2

where T is the age of the universe, and

dR
dt ≈ HR

(17)

(18)

Strictly speaking the above equations are order of magnitude relations. So
from (18), a further diﬀerenciation leads to the conclusion that a cosmological
constant cannot be ruled out such that

Λ ≈≤ 0(H 2)

(19)

(19) explains the smallness of the cosmological constant or the so called
cosmological problem[20].
To proceed it can be shown that the above equations lead to[21]

G =

β
T ≡ G0(1 −

t
t0

)

(20)

where t0 is the age of the universe and T is the time that has elapsed in the
present epoch. It can be shown that (20) can explain the precession of the
perihelion of Mercury[21].
We could also explain the correct gravitational bending of light. Infact in
Newtonian theory also we obtain the bending of light, though the amount is
half that predicted by General Relativity[22]. In the Newtonian theory we
can obtain the bending from the well known orbital equations,

1
r

GM
L2 (1 + ecosΘ)

(21)

where M is the mass of the central object, L is the angular momentum
per unit mass, which in our case is bc, b being the impact parameter or
minimum approach distance of light to the object, and e the eccentricity of
the trajectory is given by

(22)

c2L2

e2 = 1 +

For the deﬂection of light α, if we substitute r = ±∞, and then use (22) we
get

2GM
bc2
This is half the General Relativistic value.
We also note that the eﬀect of time variation on r is given by (cf.ref.[21])

α =

r = r0(1 −

Using (24) the well known equation for the trajectory is given by (Cf.[23],[24],[25])

r and primes denote diﬀerenciation with respect to Θ.

where u = 1
The ﬁrst term on the right hand side represents the Newtonian contribution
while the remaining terms are the contributions due to (24). The solution of
(25) is given by

u =

L2 (cid:20)1 + ecos(cid:26)(cid:18)1 −

t

2t0(cid:19) Θ + ω(cid:27)(cid:21)

(26)

where ω is a constant of integration. Corresponding to −∞ < r < ∞ in the
Newtonian case we have in the present case, −t0 < t < t0, where t0 is large
and inﬁnite for practical purposes. Accordingly the analogue of the reception
of light for the observer, viz., r = +∞ in the Newtonian case is obtained by
taking t = t0 in (26) which gives

u =

GM

L2 + ecos(cid:18)Θ

2

+ ω(cid:19)

(27)

Comparison of (27) with the Newtonian solution obtained by neglecting terms
∼ t/t0 in equations (24),(25) and (26) shows that the Newtonian Θ is replaced
by Θ
2 , whence the deﬂection obtained by equating the left side of (27) to zero,
is

(28)

t

2t0(cid:19) = −

1
e

cosΘ(cid:18)1 −

10

where e is given by (22). The value of the deﬂection from (28) is twice the
Newtonian deﬂection given by (23). That is the deﬂection α is now given
not by (23) but by the correct formula,

α =

4GM
bc2 ,

We now come to the problem of galactic rotational curves (cf.ref.[22]). We
would expect, on the basis of straightforward dynamics that the rotational
velocities at the edges of galaxies would fall oﬀ according to

v2 ≈

GM

r

However it is found that the velocities tend to a constant value,

v ∼ 300km/sec

(29)

(30)

This has lead to the postulation of dark matter. We observe that from (24)
it can be easily deduced that

a ≡ (¨ro − ¨r) ≈

1
to

(t ¨ro + 2 ˙ro) ≈ −2

ro
t2
o

(31)

as we are considering inﬁnitesimal intervals t and nearly circular orbits.
Equation (31) shows (Cf.ref[21] also) that there is an anomalous inward ac-
celeration, as if there is an extra attractive force, or an additional central
mass.
So,

GMm

r2 +

2mr
o ≈
t2

From (32) it follows that

mv2

r

(32)

(33)

v ≈   2r2

t2
o

+

GM

r !1/2

From (33) it is easily seen that at distances within the edge of a typical
galaxy, that is r < 1023cms the equation (29) holds but as we reach the edge
and beyond, that is for r ≥ 1024cms we have v ∼ 107cms per second, in
agreement with (30).

11

Thus the time variation of G given in equation (20) explains observation
without invoking dark matter.
Interestingly a background Zero Point Field of the type discussed above, is
associated with a cosmological constant in General Relativity[26]. We can
reconcile this latter view with the above considerations. For this we observe
that the variation in G, is small so that over a small period of time the
General Relativistic equations hold approximately. Thus we have

¨R(t) = −4πρ(t)GR(t)/3 + ΛR(t)/3

In (34) we use equation (20), to get on using the above considerations

Λ ∼

Gρ
√N

(34)

(35)

On the other hand the Zero Point Field leads to a cosmological constant
(Cf.ref.[26])

(36)
In the above ﬂuctuational cosmological picture, as √N particles are created
we get

Λ ∼ G < ρvac >

√N ρvac

ρ ∼

(37)

(35) and (36) can be seen to be identical upon using (37).
This ofcourse should not be surprising, because in both cases we have eﬀec-
tively a cosmological constant which is a manifestation of vaccuum energy.

4 Comments

It must be mentioned that the value of the neutrino mass as deduced in
equation (12) rules out the neutrino as a candidate for dark mass, so that
there is no contradiction with the observed ever continuing expansion of the
universe. It must also be mentioned that the value of the cosmological con-
stant from vacuum energy as deduced by Zeldovich (Cf.ref.[26]) was adhoc
and unclear. The eﬀective cosmological constant which we have deduced,
however, is consistent.
Interestingly, by reversing the steps in Section 3 we can conclude that a small
cosmological constant would imply a variable G.

12

It may be mentioned that what was called the ether and later the quan-
tum vacuum has been the concept that has survived the whole of the twen-
tieth Century, through the works of Physicists like Dirac[27], Vigier[28],
Nelson[29], Prigogine[30], and more recently through the works of Rueda
and co-workers[31], the author[5] and even string theoriests like Wilzeck.
We also remark that the considerations of Section 2 (Cf. equations (1) and
(2)), show that a Fermion while spread out is localized to within the Compton
wavelength. On the other hand the neutrino can be considered to be a truly
point particle–the double connectivity of the space, the divide between the
region within the Compton wavelength of ”negative energy” solutions, and
the region without disappears. The neutrino is the divide between Fermions
and Bosons.
Finally, it may be mentioned that such a space time cut oﬀ is at the heart
of a fractal picture of space time, studied by Nottale, Ord, El Naschie, the
author and others (Cf.ref.[32] and references therein).

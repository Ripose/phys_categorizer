Abstract

We consider several viscous models with metrics FRW (k = 0) but
with variable G, c and Λ . We ﬁnd trivially a set of solutions through
Dimensional Analysis.

1 Introduction.

Recently have been studied several models with metrics FRW where the
”constants” G and Λ ([3]) are considered as dependent functions on time t
([1]). Most recently this type of models have been generalized by Arbab ([2])
who considers a viscous ﬂuid. Other authors ([3]) study models with c and G
variables for perfect ﬂuids. In this paper we want to calculate as vary these
”constants” G, c and Λ within the models FRW with a viscous ﬂuid. We
want to emphasize as the use of the Dimensional Analysis (D.A.) permits us
to ﬁnd in a trivial way a set of solutions to this type of models (but with

k = 0), taking into account the conservation principle (divTij = 0), since the
type of diﬀerential equations that go emerging can be (are) cumbersome. We
have not wanted to make a meticulous study of the solutions obtained for
each (ω, n) (we let this paragraph for a subsequent paper) but to show the
obtained results.

The paper is organized as follows: In the second paragraph are made
some small considerations on the followed dimensional method (address to
reader to the classic literature on the topic ([5])). In the third paragraph we
make use of the Dimensional Analysis ( Pi theorem) to obtain a solution to
the principal quantities that appear in the model and ﬁnally in the fourth
paragraph we end with a short exposition of the obtained cases.

The modiﬁed ﬁeld equations are:

8πG(t)

(1)

and we impose that

div(Tij) = 0

where Λ(t) represents the ”cosmological constant”. The basic ingredients of
the model are:

The line element is deﬁned by:

ds2 = −c2dt2 + f 2(t)

dr2
1 − kr2 + r2
here only we will consider the case k = 0. The energy-momentum tensor is
deﬁned by:

dθ2 + sin 2θdφ2

integrating the equation (4) we obtain the following equation.

ρ = Aωf −3(ω+1)

where f represents the scale factor that appears in the metrics and Aω is the
constant of integration that depends on the equation of state that is imposed.
The eﬀect of the viscosity in the equations is shown replacing p by p − 3ηH
(H = f ′/f ) ([2] and [4] for details). where:

This last equation (of state) in our opinion does not verify the dimensional
homogeneity principle, by this reason we have the changed it by:

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

η = η0ρn

η = knρn

where the constant kn causes that the above equation will be dimensionally
homogeneous for any value of n. The dimensional analysis that we apply
needs to make the following distinctions. We need to know beforehand the
set of fundamental quantities, in this case it is solely the cosmic time t as
is deduced of the homogeneity and isotropy of the model and to distinguish
the set of constants, universal and unavoidable or characteristic, in this case
there are no universal constants since are all functions on t (G(t), c(t), Λ(t))
(G(t), c(t), ,that is to say we do not consider them, and the two only constants
that appear are respectively the constant of integration Aω that depending
on the equation of state that is imposed will have diﬀerent dimensions and
physical meaning and the constant kn that it will depend on the equation of
state that we impose for η.

In a previous paper ([6]) was calculated the dimensional base of this type
of models, being this B = {L, M, T, θ} where θ represents the dimension of
the temperature. The corresponding dimensions of each magnitude (with
respect to this base) are:

[t] = T

[Aω] = L2+3ωMT −2

[kn] = Ln−1M 1−nT 2n−1

All the magnitude that we go to calculate we will make it exclusively in
function of the cosmic time t and of the constant unavoidable kn and Aω
with respect to a dimensional base B = {L, M, T, θ} .

3 Solutions through A.D.

We go to calculate through dimensional analysis D.A. the variation of G(t)
in function of t, the speed of the light c(t), energy density ρ@(t), the radius
of the universe f (t), the temperature θ(t), and ﬁnally Λ(t)@.

3.1 Calculation of G(t)

As have indicated above, we go to accomplish the calculation applying the
Pi theorem. The magnitude that we consider are: G = G(t, kn, Aω).B =
{L, M, T, θ} . We know that [G] = L3M −1T −2

5 Conclusions

We have solved through Dimensional Analysis a viscous FRW model with k =
0 and taking into account the energy-momentum tensor and with G, Λ and c
variables. We observe that the solutions that we have obtained coincide with
the already obtained by Arbab unless that in this case our model envisages
the variation on c, generalizing thus the solutions. We let the conclusions
and study of each case for a subsequent paper.

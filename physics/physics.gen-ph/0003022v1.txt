COMMENTS ON THE PAPER ”ON THE

UNIFICATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL

FORCES...”

Abstract

In this brief paper we justify observations made in El Naschie’s pa-
per ”On the Uniﬁcation of the Fundamental Forces...”, on the Planck
scale, fractal space time and the uniﬁcation of interactions, from dif-
ferent standpoints.

In a recent paper El Naschie[1] has emphasized the intimate connection be-
tween the Planck length, the Compton wavelength and a uniﬁcation of the
fundamental interactions within the framework of complex time and a frac-
tal Cantorian space. We will now make some observations which justify the
contentions made in the above paper, from diﬀerent standpoints.
1. Complex Time: It has been pointed out[2, 3, 4] that Fermions can be
thought of as Kerr-Newman Black Holes, in the context of quantized space
time: There are minimum space time intervals, and when we average over
these, Physics arises. Within the minimum intervals, we encounter un-
physical Zitterbewegung eﬀects, which also show up as a complexiﬁcation
of coordinates[5] - indeed they are the double Weiner process discussed by
Abbott and Wise, Nottale and others. It may be mentioned that the transi-
tion from the Kerr metric in General Relativity to the Kerr-Newman metric
is obtained by precisely such a complex shift of coordinates, a circumstance
which has no clear meaning in Classical Physics[6]. On the other hand it is
this ”Classical” Kerr-Newman metric which describes the ﬁeld of an electron

1

including the Quantum Mechanical anomalous gyro magnetic ratio, g = 2.
This has been discussed in detail in references[2, 3].
2. The Uniﬁcation of Electromagnetism and Gravitation and the Planck
Scale:
It is in the context of point 1 that we arrive at a uniﬁed picture
of electromagnetism and gravitation (Cf.ref.[4]). The point is that at the
Compton wavelength scale we have purely Quantum Mechanical eﬀects like
Zitterbewegung, spin half and electromagnetism, while at the Planck scale,
we have a purely classical Schwarschild Black Hole. However the Planck
scale is the extreme limit of the Compton scale, where electromagnetism
and gravitation meet (Cf.ref.[4], and [7]). This is because for a Planck mass
mP ∼ 10−5gms we have

(1)

Gm2
P
e2 ∼ 1

whereas for an elementary particle like an electron we have the well known
equation

Gm2
e2 ∼

1
√N ≡ 10−40

(2)

where N ∼ 1080 is the number of elementary particles in the universe.
Another way of expressing this result is that the Schwarzschild radius for
the Planck mass equals its Compton wavelength. This is where Quantum
Mechanics and Classical Physics meet.
This point can be analysed further[7]. From equations (1) and (2) it can be
seen that we obtain the Planck mass, when the number of particles in the
universe is 1. Indeed as has been pointed out by Rosen[8], the Planck mass
can be considered to be a mini universe, in the context of the Schrodinger
equation with the gravitational interaction.
3. The above brings us to another interesting aspect discussed by El Naschie
in[1]. This is the fact that the Planck mass is intimately related to the Hawk-
ing radiation, and infact from the latter consideration we can deduce that a
Planck mass ”evaporates” within about 10−42secs, which also happens to be
its Compton time!
On the other hand, as pointed out in[5, 7], an elementary particle like the
pion is intimately related to Hagedorn radiation which leads to a life time of
the order of the age of the universe.
The above two conclusions have been obtained on the basis of a background
Zero Point Field, the Langevin equation and space time cut oﬀs leading to a

2

ﬂuctuational creation of particles at the Planck scale and the Compton scale
respectively.
4. Resolution and the Uniﬁcation of Interactions: El Naschie[1] has referred
to the fact that there is no apriori ﬁxed length scale (the Biedenharn conjec-
ture). Indeed it has been argued by the author in the above context[9, 10]
that depending on our scale of resolution, we encounter electromagnetism
well outside the Compton wavelength, strong interactions at the Compton
wavelength or slightly below it and only gravitation at the Planck scale. The
diﬀerences between the various interactions are a manifestation of the reso-
lution.
4. The Universe as a Black Hole: As pointed out in[1] by El Naschie and
the author[11, 12], the universe can indeed be considered to be a black hole.
Prima Facie this is clear from the fact that the radius of the universe is of
the order of the Schwarzchild radius of a black hole with the same mass as
the universe. Also as pointed out in[11]) the age of the universe coincides
with the time taken by a ray of light to travel from the horizon of a black
hole to its centre or vice versa.
5. The ”Core” of the Electron: El Naschie refers to the core of the electron
∼ 10−20cms, as indeed has been experimentally noticed by Dehmelt and Co-
workers[13]. It is interesting that this can be deduced in the context of the
electron as a Quantum Mechanical Kerr-Newman Black Hole.
It was shown that[2] for distances of the order of the Compton wavelength
the potential is given in its QCD form

V ≈ −

βM

For small values of r the potential (3) can be written as

It follows from (4) that

µ ∼ 10−21cm.

r ∼

(4)

(5)

Curiously enough in (4), r appears as a time, which is to be expected because
at the horizon of a black hole r and t interchange roles.
One could reach the same conclusion, as given in equation (5) from a diﬀerent

3

µr

angle. In the Schrodinger equation which is used in QCD, with the potential
given by (3), one could verify that the wave function is of the type f (r).e−
2 ,
where the same µ appears in (4). Thus, once again one has a wave packet
which is negligible outside the distance given by (5).
It may be noted that Brodsky and Drell[14] had suggested from a very dif-
ferent viewpoint viz., the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, that
its size would be limited by 10−20cm. The result (5) was experimentally con-
ﬁrmed by Dehmelt and co-workers [13].
Finally, it may be remarked that it is the fractal double Weiner process
referred to earlier that leads from the real space coordinate, x say, to the
complex coordinate x + ıct (Cf.ref.[5]), which is the space and time divide:
As pointed out by Hawking[15] and others, an imaginary time would lead
to a ”static” Euclidean four geometry, rather than the Minkowski world, a
concept that has been criticised by Prigogine[16]. It is in the above fractal
formulation (Cf.ref.[5]), on the contrary, that we see the emergence of the
space and time divide, that is, time itself.
Thus in conclusion, it may be said that the recognition of a fractal quantized
underpinning of space time ties together several apparently disparate facts.

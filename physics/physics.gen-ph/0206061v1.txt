Abstract:

(This work has been copyrighted with the Library of Congress) A number of
well-known diﬃculties in physics resulted from merging the theory of relativ-
ity with the Compton-de Broglie wave mechanics. Two such problems were
the failure of Dirac’s relativistic wave equation to predict the correct velocity
of the electron, and the fact that the measured yield from nuclear ﬁssion was
found to be substantially less than the theoretical yield. It is shown that the
origin of these and other problems stems from the inconsistency of the rela-
tivistic mass-energy equivalence principle with the fundamental assumptions
of wave mechanics. An alternative view of the concept of mass-energy equiv-
alence that results in a very good agreement between theory and experiment
is demonstrated. The conclusions of this paper will be quite important for
ongoing research, such as the current problem of the neutrino’s mass.

1 Introduction:

The success of the modern theory of matter is certainly due in no small part
to its dependence on the new wave mechanics of Compton, de Broglie and
Schr¨odinger. As it is ﬁrmly established, the modern theory of matter began
with the independent eﬀorts of Bohr and Sommerfeld and was subsequently
reﬁned with the introduction of the non-relativistic Compton-de Broglie me-
chanics. Later, however, eﬀorts to merge that new theory with the theory
of relativity resulted in some successes and some serious diﬃculties, some of
which remain largely unsolved today. The ﬁrst diﬃculty was the mystery of
the lost energy in the beta-decay process, for which W.Pauli postulated the
existence of the neutrino. While the existence of that particle was veriﬁed
experimentally, any calculations involving the neutrino’s energy or mass re-
main inconclusive[14],[15]. Another diﬃculty was encountered by Dirac[4] in
his attempt to obtain a relativistic wave equation to describe the motion of
a free electron. Dirac obtained a Hamiltonian1 of the form

~H = c (~p [α]) + m0c2 ~ξ

4 matrix, and ~ξ and ~p are 1

where c is the velocity of light, m0 is the rest mass of the particle, [α] is a
4 vectors, ~p being the momentum vector.

To check his theory, Dirac proceeded to calculate the x component of the
velocity of the particle, ˙x, from the Poisson bracket

observed in practice to have velocities considerably less than that of light,
it would seem that we have here a contradiction with experiment.” He then
went on to conclude that: “The contradiction is not real, though, since the
theoretical velocity in the above conclusion is the velocity at one instant of

time while observed velocities are always average velocities through appre-
ciable time intervals”. So Dirac chose to ignore that serious contradiction
between theory and experiment and oﬀered instead an interpretation that
does not correlate with physical reality and which is still, to date, not sup-
ported by any experimental evidence. Nevertheless, the soundness of Dirac’s
theoretical approach allowed him to make correct predictions, such as about
the existence of spin and of antiparticles. Beside the early diﬃculties of the
beta-decay and of Dirac’s equation, a number of other diﬃculties emerged
later. Most notably, the fact that the measured yield of the nuclear explo-
sions that were carried during the 1940s was found to be substantially less
than the value of the energy release expected theoretically[16]. The only
explanation that this fact was attributed to was that the rapid disintegra-
tion of the mechanical structure surrounding the uranium or plutonium core
prevents the chain reaction from getting completed (though admittedly the
entire reaction takes less than 10−6 sec. to complete). In this paper a re-
sult will be shown, however, that very strongly suggests that the true reason
was likely theoretical rather than mechanical. Another problem that clearly
emerged over the years was the fact that experiments which are designed
to measure the masses of various particles usually show a large discrepancy
between the experimental value and the theoretically expected value of the
mass of a given particle if the experiment is carried at low energies. If, how-
ever, the experiment is carried at very high energies, then the experimentally
determined value of the mass is usually found to be in very good agreement
with the theoretical value. While the list is extensive, we can mention the
meson experiments[25],[26],[27] as examples of experiments that were carried
at low energies and in which that fact was apparent. As examples of experi-
ments that were carried at high energies we refer to the detection of the W
and Z bosons in the early 1980s [28],[29].

In this paper we will take a long step back in time and attempt to de-
termine the fundamental cause of all the various diﬃculties that we dis-
cussed.
It will be demonstrated, beyond any doubt, that the cause is the
fundamental inconsistency of the relativistic mass-energy equivalence princi-
ple that was introduced by Einstein in 1905 with the basic assumptions of
the wave mechanics introduced by Compton and de Broglie 18 years later.
This paper is organized as follows: in Sec.2 it will be demonstrated that the
Compton-de Broglie wave mechanics has its own, very speciﬁc view, of the

3

principle of mass-energy equivalence.
In Sec.3, the diﬀerence between the
wave-mechanical view and the relativistic view of mass-energy equivalence
In Sec.4 we will demonstrate, directly from Einstein’s
will be explained.
original papers on special relativity[1],[2],[3], that there are two diﬀerent and
distinct ways to interpret the relativistic concept of mass-energy equivalence.
One of the interpretations leads to a result that is in total agreement with
wave mechanics, while the other interpretation leads to a result that is in
total disagreement. Unfortunately, the interpretation and hence the result
that is in disagreement with wave mechanics is the one that was selected by
Einstein in 1905 (and remained as a standard since then). By selecting the
interpretation that does lead to an agreement with wave mechanics we will
be able to solve, as examples, two of the substantial problems that we high-
lighted above. In Sec.5, we will rework Dirac’s theory of the relativistic wave
equation of a free particle. Unlike Dirac’s result, the result obtained here
does agree with experimental observation. In Sec.6, the problem of the large
discrepancy between the theoretical yield and the actual yield from nuclear
ﬁssion will be treated. It will be shown that the modiﬁed view introduced
here is in fact in very good agreement with the published experimental data.
Sec.7 contains a comment on the nature of beta-decay and the problem of
the shortfall in the solar neutrinos. Sec.8 summarizes the conclusions of this
paper.

2 The wave-mechanical view of the principle

of mass-energy equivalence:

The fundamental postulate of Compton and de Broglie,

which relates the wavelength λ to the momentum p of an elementary particle,
if taken together with the mathematical representation of de Broglie’s matter
waves, namely, the traveling wave equation, lead to a simple and important
result that is in direct contradiction with the relativistic principle of mass-
energy equivalence. Although de Broglie and other researchers had oﬀered

a number of proposals and suggestions that seem, superﬁcially, to resolve
the contradiction, careful examination will show that the contradiction was
never actually resolved. We shall now proceed to make a number of impor-
tant observations, ending with the result that is inconsistent with relativity.
We will then demonstrate that this result represents a very speciﬁc view of
the principle of mass-energy equivalence; a view that is inherently incompat-
ible with the relativistic view. We will attempt to keep the mathematical
developments at a minimum so that the facts can be clearly seen.

If we take a one-dimensional de Broglie wave function[4]

ψ(x, t) = A exp i(kx

ωt)

−

where A is the amplitude constant, k = 2π/λ is the propagation constant, and
ω = 2πν is the angular frequency (where ν is the frequency), we then have, by
deﬁnition, ω = kλν. Now, since the product λν is the propagation velocity
(or phase velocity), u, of the wave, then ω = ku. Using this relationship in
Eq.(4) gives

ψ(x, t) = A exp ik(x

ut).

−

From Eq.(5) we get

In the special case where the propagation velocity u is equal to c, we get
an interesting result. Since ω = kc, and since c2 = 1/ǫ0µ0, where ǫ0 and
µ0 are the permittivity and permeability of free space, respectively, then
k2 = ω2ǫ0µ0. By substitution into Eq.(6) we obtain

We should recognize that Eq.(7) is the Helmholtz equation. It can be equally
derived directly from Maxwell’s equations[9], with the result that the wave

function ψ is actually the electric ﬁeld intensity E. Through similar reason-
ing, it was concluded previously[4] that the de Broglie matter wave is indeed
an electromagnetic wave when u = c. Moving back to the general case (i.e.,
u

= c), we can further see from Eq.(5) that

∂ψ
∂t

iku ψ =

iω ψ.

Multiplying the above expression by i¯h yields

i¯h

∂ψ
∂t

= ¯hω ψ = ¯h(2πν) ψ = hν ψ.

Since Eq.(9) is the generally accepted form of the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger
equation, then the multiplicand of ψ on the right-hand side must be the total
energy H of the particle; that is, the total energy is H = hν (this result
conﬁrms de Broglie’s postulate about the total energy of the particle). Now
since

we see that

λ =

=

h
p

u
ν

,

H = hν = pu.

For de Broglie’s matter wave hypothesis to be valid we must conclude, and
indeed it has been demonstrated[4],[8], that the propagation velocity u of the
wave is equal to the particle’s velocity v (one important concept, originally
introduced by de Broglie and later promoted by others, is that a matter wave
is actually a wave packet, or wave group, that results from the superposition
of many individual waves. However, since Eq.(11) is a total energy equation,
then we have no alternative but to conclude that the wave in question is the
overall wave packet -if that concept is in fact valid- and hence u = v). Now
since p = mv, where m is the particle’s mass, then Eq.(11) becomes

H = hν = mv2.

Once again we note that in the special case of v = c, the well-known rela-
tivistic mass-energy transformation law H = mc2 is obtained. Accordingly,
from a strictly wave-mechanical point of view, the relativistic expression of
mass-energy equivalence emerges as a special case only.

3 Disagreement of the Compton-de Broglie

mechanics with relativity:

We have shown that the Helmholtz wave equation and Einstein’s mass-energy
transformation law both emerge as a special case from the Compton-de
Broglie wave mechanics, that is, when the velocity v of the particle and its as-
sociated wave is equal to c. At velocities other than c (i.e., at sub-relativistic
velocities), the expression in Eq.(12) is obviously in disagreement with rela-
tivity, since relativity would maintain that the total energy must still be ex-
pressed as mc2. We must now point out that some authors[10] have suggested
in the past that by taking the total energy to be H = pu = mvu = mc2,
then the velocity of the matter wave will be given by u = c2/v; hence u > c.
Such result is clearly an impossible result, however, given the emergence of
Helmholtz’s equation, and given the above observation about Eq.(11) (i.e.,
the fact that u must be equal to v). Simply stated, the total energy of the
particle, as deﬁned by the fundamental postulates in Eqs.(10) and (11), leads
to inconsistencies with the theory of special relativity which are unsolvable
(even if we accept such concepts as the concept of the wave packet). We also
note here that if we substitute for m in Eq.(12) by its relativistic expression

m =

m0

,

v2/c2

q

−

(13)

this of course still does not change the fundamental disagreement between
the wave-mechanical and the relativistic energy expressions (that is, mv2
versus mc2. Note that the total energy of the particle at rest, or H0, is equal
to m0c2 in special relativity, while it is precisely zero in wave mechanics).

In summary, we can clearly see that the wave-mechanical prediction of the
total energy of a particle is in serious and fundamental contradiction with

7

the relativistic prediction, and the limited eﬀorts that were carried in the
past to reconcile the two views have not had any success.

4 Origin of the law H = mc2 and an alterna-
tive understanding of the relativistic con-
cept of mass-energy equivalence:

We shall now proceed to investigate the origin of the mass-energy equivalence
principle directly from Einstein’s original papers on relativity[1],[2],[3] and
attempt to develop an understanding of the reason for the disagreement
between Einstein’s kinematics and the wave mechanics of Compton and de
Broglie. As we shall see, the two theories can in fact be reconciled perfectly,
though such reconciliation will be in a manner that was not intended or
envisioned by Einstein.

4.1 The basic observation:

In the ﬁrst relativity paper, Einstein considered the commonly applied form
of Newton’s second law of motion, F = m a. To express that law within the
framework of relativity, he obtained a relativistic transformation term for the
mass given by m = m0/(1
2 (which he labeled “longitudinal mass”).
He then carried the integration of F over a distance X to get an expression
for the work done on the particle, which must be equal to the kinetic energy
Ek of the particle. The result of the integration was

(14)

From that expression, Einstein (and others) concluded that[3]

Total particle energy = mc2 = Ek + m0c2

(15)

8

Eq.(15) has been the standard equation on which virtually all modern post-
relativistic particle physics is based. In addition to the total energy expressed
as mc2, Eq.(15) also predicts the existence of a “rest energy” that is given
by the term m0c2. Originally, it was not clear from Einstein’s derivation
how the mass multiplier term 1/(1
2 was obtained. Later, however,
a number of authors[5],[6] pointed out that most likely Einstein’s approach
was the following: since Newton’s second law can be more fundamentally
expressed as “Force = rate of change of momentum”, or F = dp/dt, and
since the momentum can be expressed as

This is precisely the expression that appeared in Einstein’s ﬁrst paper[1] and
which led to the formula given by Eq.(14). We shall now describe the second
method for calculating the integral of Eq.(18). Although the result must be
the same numerically, we shall see that the physical implications of the result
are potentially diﬀerent. If we integrate by parts, Eq.(18) is re-written as

(this can be veriﬁed by substituting for m by its relativistic expression and
rearranging the terms). Now, in light of the conclusion about the total energy
obtained in the previous section, that is, if indeed we can express the total
energy of the particle by the quantity mv2, then Eq.(24) would lead us to
conclude that

Total particle energy = mv2 = Ek + m0c2(1

v2/c2),

(26)

−

q

which is of course signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from Einstein’s expression in Eq.(15).
The relevant diﬀerence between the two expressions is, of course, that Eq.(26)
agrees with the wave-mechanical prediction while Einstein’s expression does

10

not. The obvious question now is: which expression is ultimately correct?
To answer that question, we note the following very important fact: Einstein
derived the kinetic energy equation ﬁrst and then oﬀered the mass-energy
transformation law of Eq.(15) as an interpretation[2],[3]. There was no di-
rect derivation of that law from the fundamental axioms of relativity, as can
be clearly concluded from those two subsequent papers (see additional re-
marks in Sec.4.2 below). The mass-energy transformation law was merely an
interpretation of the original kinetic energy equation Ek = mc2
m0c2. Had
Einstein carried the integration diﬀerently -as we have just shown above- he
would have obtained the expanded form of that equation, that is,

−

Ek = mv2

m0c2(1

−
m0c2)

−

v2/c2),

1
q

−

(27)

and in all likelihood he would have concluded that the total energy of the
particle must be given by the quantity mv2. In other words, we can clearly
see that the wave-mechanical total energy expression H = mv2 is indeed
distinguishable from Einstein’s kinematics, while the expression H = mc2
was essentially the result of subconscious interpretation of the original ki-
netic energy equation, shown between parenthesis under Eq.(27) above. Of
course, Einstein was a predecessor to de Broglie and had no guideline to
follow when he made that original interpretation. In view of these facts, it
is clear that the theory of relativity should have been reconciled with wave
mechanics by taking the expression H = mv2 as the total energy formula. It
is unfortunate, however, that such a step was not taken for so many years,
especially in view of the large number of theoretical results that do not seem
to correlate with experimental data.

If we now assume that Eq.(26) is valid, then we must conclude that the
term m0c2(1
v2/c2) is the mass-energy term. We must further con-
clude that the mass-energy is velocity-dependent and hence is equal to zero
v2/c2
at rest. An interesting test of Eq.(24) will be to expand the term
in the equation into a power series, obtaining

For small velocities, that is, v

which is the classical expression of kinetic energy. Of course, we can further
make the conclusion here that the mass-energy term is approximately equal
to 1/2 m0v2 at small velocities. This last observation is important and will
be used again in Sec.6.

4.2 Remarks about references [2],[3] and the law of

photonic exchange:

−

In the second relativity paper[2], Einstein stated the law H = mc2 for
the ﬁrst time as a “general conclusion” from the kinetic energy equation
Ek = mc2
m0c2 (after deriving a law of radiation that is discussed below).
Perhaps realizing that this general conclusion was not clearly explained, he
elaborated on it further in a third paper[3] that was published in 1907. In
that paper, Einstein wrote the expression: Total Energy = Kinetic-Energy +
Mass-Energy. He indicated (without any proof) that the mass-energy quan-
tity must be a constant. He then referred again to the kinetic energy equation
Ek = mc2

m0c2 and wrote:

−

“One then obtains: Total Energy = m0c2/

v2/c2”

1
q

−

(note that the modern notation is used here instead of the actual notation
shown in the paper). As we indicated earlier, such interpretation of the ki-
netic energy equation has remained unquestioned to this day.

12

Concerning the law of radiation that was shown in the second paper (which
we can refer to in modern terms as the law of photonic exchange), we must
note some important facts.
In that paper, Einstein considered the equiv-
alence between a quantum of radiation L and the kinetic energy Ek of a
particle. First we must observe, in view of the above discussion, that the
kinetic energy is numerically equal to ∆mc2. If a particle emits a quantum
of radiation and its kinetic energy is altered, then the energy contained in
such a quantum will be numerically equal to ∆mc2 (where ∆m is the “appar-
ent”, or relativistic mass change). Einstein did correctly reach this conclusion
(though he used a series of very primitive assumptions in his analysis and
indicated that the result can be obtained by expanding the Lorentz transfor-
mation terms, which was an unnecessary step). The problem now lies with
the “general conclusion” that was stated after that derivation. As we have
demonstrated above, the total energy of the particle is not equal to mc2, but
rather mv2.
If the particle is totally annihilated and a pair of photons is
emitted, then the energy contained in such a pair will be numerically equal
to mv2, where m is the total relativistic mass of the particle. In other words,
there is a very clear and strong distinction between the kinetic energy and
the total energy of a particle, and while the former is numerically equal to
∆mc2, the latter is numerically equal to mv2. Such distinction was not made
by the standard formulation of special relativity.

We must ﬁnally point out that the equation H = mv2 leads to a very impor-
tant conclusion: obviously, mass-energy transformations will not be possible
unless relative motion is present. If a particle decays, for instance, then the
decay energy will not be observed by an observer who is stationary with
respect to that particle; it will be observed only by an observer who is in rel-
ative motion with respect to that particle (indeed, some experiments[22] that
sought in the past to detect the decay of stationary particles have showed
In addition, we must conclude that photonic exchanges
negative results).
in general are not possible unless relative motion is present (since H = 0 if
v = 0). This last conclusion, of course, does agree with our current under-
standings from the theory of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).

To summarize the above discussion: had Einstein obtained the kinetic en-

13

ergy expression Ek = mv2
v2/c2) instead of the original
expression Ek = mc2
m0c2, he would have made the conclusions that we
reached above instead of the original conclusions that resulted as standard
from the theory of special relativity.

5 Modiﬁed relativistic theory for the motion

of a free particle:

±

In view of the foregoing, we shall now assume that the correct total energy
expression is H = mv2 and examine what the implications are for Dirac’s
free-particle theory. As we indicated in Sec.1, Dirac obtained a Hamiltonian
that led him to conclude that the velocity of any particle must be always
c, which is of course a result that does not have any correlation
equal to
with physical reality. Although Dirac speculated[4] at that time that the ve-
locity might actually be composed of a steady-state part and an oscillatory
part, such speculation was not conﬁrmed experimentally. Moreover, Dirac
attempted but was unable to show mathematically how the proposed two
components would add up to be precisely equal to c. We shall now proceed
to rework Dirac’s theory, using H = mv2, and obtaining a new Hamiltonian
in the process. As we shall verify, the new Hamiltonian will directly lead to
v; which is of course a result
the result that the velocity must be equal to
that is in sharp contrast with Dirac’s result and which does agree with ex-
perimental observation. We shall also verify that the spin magnetic moment
term obtained by Dirac remains unchanged in the present formulation.

±

5.1 The wave equation:

We shall begin by describing brieﬂy Dirac’s approach for obtaining the rela-
tivistic wave equation and then proceed to derive the modiﬁed equation and
hence the modiﬁed Hamiltonian. Dirac considered the mass of the particle as
v2/c2. If we square
represented by its relativistic expression m = m0/
that expression and rearrange the terms, we get

This was Dirac’s total energy equation and was subsequently used to obtain
the relativistic wave equation. To obtain the modiﬁed wave equation, we
now proceed to multiply Eq.(31) by v2, getting

Using H = mv2 as the total energy of the particle, we have, from the above

mass terms. Multiplying Eq.(40) by the vector ( ~p0 +

We now consider the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld to obtain
a formulation for the spin magnetic moment term that must appear in the
ﬁnal Hamiltonian (we assume the absence of an electrostatic ﬁeld here). In
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the change in the particle’s momentum ∆p
that occurs as a result of the interaction with the ﬁeld is given by[7]

∆p =

obtained by Dirac[4]. The second conclusion is a conﬁrmation that this part
of Dirac’s theory was correct. The ﬁrst conclusion, however, shows a fact
that was not apparent from Dirac’s theory. Speciﬁcally, when ~M = 0 (that

6 The problem of the energy released from

nuclear ﬁssion:

Note: The information contained in this section is based on previously known
public information.

As we indicated previously in Sec.1, it is currently believed that the eﬃ-
ciency of nuclear ﬁssion as an energy source is extremely low. The eﬃciency
is deﬁned as the ratio of the amount of energy (or yield) obtained from a
given mass of ﬁssionable material to the theoretical value of the total energy
that is expected to be released from that mass. In nuclear weapons as well
as in nuclear reactors, that eﬃciency ﬁgure is typically on the order of a few
percentage points (though eﬃciencies as high as 40% have been achieved).
Usually, it is assumed that most of the atoms of the ﬁssionable material sim-
ply do not undergo ﬁssion in the chain reaction and are thus “wasted” in
the process. As a speciﬁc case to consider, Serber[16] indicated that the eﬃ-
ciency of the “Little Boy” weapon that was used against Hiroshima in 1945
was about 2%. In this section, we shall rework the calculations given by Ser-
ber for that speciﬁc example, using the equation H = mv2. As we shall see,
the eﬃciency will actually prove to be much higher; but more importantly,
we will get a theoretical estimate for the energy release that is in very good
agreement with the actual measured value.

6.1 Energy of ﬁssion as a function of the nuclear ex-

citation:

It has been known for at least three decades that the equation H = mc2 does
not give an accurate estimate of the total kinetic energy of the fragments
In laboratory experiments using
that result from the ﬁssion of a nucleus.
thermal neutrons[18],[20], for instance, it is usually found that the total ki-
netic energy (TKE) of the fragments that result from the ﬁssion of either
U 235 or P u239 is 20-60Mev less than the Q-value of the reaction predicted by
the quantity ∆mc2. It is typically assumed that the diﬀerence between the
Q-value and the TKE of the fragments is lost into unobservable eﬀects, such
as additional excitation energy of the fragments. As we indicated above, that

20

energy deﬁcit can be as high as 98% in nuclear weapons (though the usual
assumption in that case is that the chain reaction simply does not complete).
Our objective now is to calculate a Q-value for the ﬁssion reaction of U 235 by
using the quantity ∆mv2 instead of the quantity ∆mc2. As we shall verify,
the TKE will prove to be in very good agreement with the numerical value
of the quantity ∆mv2. We shall also reach the conclusion that the quantity
∆mc2 represents a maximum theoretical limit for the energy that can be
obtained from nuclear ﬁssion.

Recent models[19],[21] of the nuclear ﬁssion process have sought to obtain a
precise numerical prediction of the TKE of the fragments by extending the
successful liquid-drop model originally introduced by Bohr and Wheeler. In
those models, the equation that is relied upon for predicting the TKE is the
Coulomb potential energy equation, that is,

TKE of fragments =

(58)

Z1Z2e2
4πǫ0D

,

where Z1, Z2 are the atomic numbers of the two positively charged fragments
(we shall temporarily assume that the kinetic energy of the neutrons emerg-
ing from the reaction is negligible), e is the elementary charge and D is the
distance between the electrostatic centers of the two fragments at the mo-
ment of separation. The value of D is known to be strongly dependent on the
state of the deformation of the nucleus[21] before the occurrence of ﬁssion.
Under laboratory conditions, the deformation of the nucleus is minimal and
hence the distance D is at a minimum; the TKE therefore has the highest
possible value. In a nuclear explosion, however, the conditions are substan-
tially diﬀerent. Since the energy density (that is, the energy per unit volume
of the material) is very high, the nucleus is expected to be very highly ex-
cited and hence the distance D will be at a maximum. Accordingly, the TKE
should be expected to have the lowest possible value. We shall now obtain
a numerical value for the TKE in this speciﬁc case (i.e., when the TKE is
minimum), and demonstrate that this numerical value is in agreement with
the quantity ∆mv2.

In general, determining the deformation and hence the distance D for a highly
deformed nucleus cannot be expected to give a precise answer, since such de-

21

formation is very circumstantial. We can, however, obtain a precise estimate
of the minimum Q-value of the reaction by applying Eq.(58) to the nucleus
before the occurrence of ﬁssion. According to the recent models[12],[17], the
two positive fragments can be regarded, before the occurrence of ﬁssion, as
two coupled oscillators. In such a model, the potential energy of the oscilla-
tors is constantly transformed into kinetic energy and vice versa, under the
inﬂuence of the strong nuclear force. The total mechanical energy of the
oscillators at any time will be therefore equal to the peak Coulomb poten-
tial, that is, the potential at the nadir of the displacement. Hence, the sum
(P.Energy + K.Energy) at the moment of the separation of the oscillators
(that is, when ﬁssion occurs) must be equal to the peak Coulomb potential.
But since the TKE of the fragments after the separation is observed in prac-
tice to be numerically in agreement with only the potential energy at the
separation, then we must conclude -if we take the coupled oscillators model
as valid- that the internal kinetic energy gets totally consumed in equalizing,
or “breaking”, the strong nuclear force. If we now assume that ﬁssion will
occur when this internal kinetic energy is at a maximum, then calculating
this quantity will be in fact quite simple. This quantity will be given by

K.Energy (internal, max.) =
P.Energy (max.) - P.Energy (at separation) =
Z1Z2e2
4πǫ0 (cid:18)

Dsep !

Dmin −

1

,

(59)

where Dmin is the minimum distance between the oscillators (or the distance
at the nadir) and Dsep is the distance at the moment of separation. The
observed TKE of the fragments after separation typically indicate that ﬁssion
occurs at a distance Dsep that is larger than the nuclear diameter, or larger
than 10fm (note: 1fm = 10−15 meters). The choice of Dmin for a highly
deformed nucleus is actually a straightforward choice. Since the range of
the strong nuclear force is known to be about 1.2fm (beyond that range, the
nucleus will be unstable [12],[17]), the maximum acceptable value for Dmin
will be therefore 1.2fm. Now, by comparing Dmin to Dsep, we can clearly see
from Eq.(59) that the maximum internal kinetic energy will be approximately
equal to the maximum potential energy. If we assume that the masses of the

22

two oscillators -or coupled fragments- are m1 and m2, Eq.(59) can therefore
be written as

The most common values for the atomic numbers Z1 and Z2 in the ﬁssion

substituting with the numerical values of these variables into Eq.(60) we

that the maximum velocity v of the oscillating fragments is: v = 45
meters/sec. This value also represents the velocity that will be acquired
by the vanishing mass ∆m at the moment of the separation (note that the

6.2 Application of the minimum Q-value to the Little

Boy example:

We shall now proceed to apply the minimum Q-value that we calculated,
Qmin, to the case of the Little Boy bomb; but we shall ﬁrst demonstrate that
we can obtain approximately the same numerical value by using a totally
diﬀerent approach. Serber[16] had given a phenomenological formula for
calculating the mean velocity of the fragments after separation, v′, that was
derived by using the kinetic theory of gases. That formula is speciﬁc to
nuclear explosion models, and gives the velocity as follows:

This estimate, though not accurate, is of course very close to the minimum
Q-value given by Eq.(64). We shall now use the minimum Q-value to obtain
an estimate for the total amount of energy released in the explosion of the
1024
Little Boy. To calculate that quantity, we note that there are 2.58
atoms per Kg of U 235 and that a total of 40Kgs were used in the bomb;
hence,

≈

20.6 Ktons.

(68)

This number is of course very close to the actual reported yield of 15Ktons
for the Little Boy[16] (we must point out here that the U 235 used in that
application was only 90% enriched, which makes the eﬀective mass about

25

36Kgs. This actually brings the two numbers much closer to each other).

To compare the above result with the original calculation, in which a Q-
value of 200Mev is expected, we ﬁrst note that the maximum practical energy
release per atom was measured to be about 170Mev under laboratory condi-
tions. Had we used that value, we would have obtained a theoretical yield of
780Ktons! To compare the eﬃciency in both cases, we note that according
to this calculation the lowest estimate for the eﬃciency of the bomb will be

Eﬃciency =

15Ktons
20.6Ktons ≈

73%,

(69)

which is in sharp contrast with the ﬁgure of 2% that resulted from the orig-
inal calculation (that is, 15/780 = 2%). The important conclusion here of
course is not the eﬃciency ﬁgure, but the fact that the theoretical yield of
20.6Ktons is in very good agreement with the actual yield of 15Ktons, as
opposed to the original expectation of 780Ktons.

It will be therefore apparent from the above analysis that the Q-value of
a nuclear reaction, as given by the quantity ∆mv2, is in very good agreement
with the experimental data. The Q-value given by the quantity ∆mc2 is
therefore a maximum theoretical limit. Moreover, it will be clear that the
Q-value of any given reaction is not a constant, but is a function of the state
of deformation of the nucleus.

Remark about reference[16]:
It is interesting to note that Serber indicated that he had substantial ar-
guments with Oppenheimer and his other colleagues about the assumptions
that were used in calculating the eﬃciency of the bomb. Moreover, it is evi-
dent from the book that he contradicted his own opinion a number of times,
stating in some instances that: “it is just possible for the reaction to occur
to an interesting extent before it is stopped by the spreading of the active
material”. This remark was made in light of the calculation that showed that
the entire reaction should take less than 10−6 sec. for completion. Of course,
from the calculation of the velocity of the fragments given above, Serber and
his colleagues were aware that the expansion in the radius of the core should
be less than 2 meters during the 1µs that is required for completion of the

26

reaction. Further, it is interesting to note that the possibility of spontaneous
ﬁssion wasn’t factored in at all in the calculation; which is a process that is
very likely to occur given the state of very high excitation of the atoms.

7 A note on the nature of beta-decay and

the problem of the solar neutrinos:

We shall now explain brieﬂy how the equation H = mv2 can provide a sat-
isfactory explanation for the experimental data observed in the beta-decay
process, without the necessity of having a second particle, namely, the neu-
trino, emitted in the process. This by no means is meant to suggest that the
neutrino does not exist, since the existence of the particle was veriﬁed exper-
imentally. What this discussion will demonstrate, however, is that neutrinos
are likely to be generated in high-energy nuclear reactions, but not in the
radioactive beta-decay of atoms. A possible explanation for the phenomenon
of the shortfall in the solar neutrinos will also be given.

In Fermi’s original theory[11], the principle of conservation of energy, lin-
ear momentum, and angular momentum require the existence of a second
particle, that is, the neutrino. By using this two-particle model, Fermi con-
cluded that the number of electrons N emitted for each momentum value Pe
will be given by

N

∝

P 2

e (Emax

Ek)2,

−

(70)

where Ek is the electron’s kinetic energy and Emax is the maximum possible
energy (as calculated from the traditional expression H = ∆mc2). The Kurie
plot that is usually obtained in the beta-decay experiments conﬁrms Eq.(70).
Fermi’s theory does not exclude, but in fact it does require, that the linear
and angular momenta of the decaying nucleus (or neutron) be factored in the
momentum conservation equations. If we now assume that a neutrino will
not be emitted, Fermi’s theory and Eq.(70) still hold since the second particle
in Fermi’s model will be the decaying nucleus itself (that is, the two-particle
model is still applicable). The problem in this case, however, becomes the
principle of conservation of energy, since basic mechanics imply that nearly

27

all the missing energy must be carried away by the electron’s kinetic energy.
Let us consider the speciﬁc case of the beta-decay of a nucleus (such as the
tritium nucleus, which releases a maximum energy of 18.6Kev). According to
the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the process of beta-decay
occurs according to the following reaction:

u + e− + ¯νe,

d

→

where d is a down quark, u is an up quark, e− is the emitted electron, and ¯νe
is an antineutrino. If we now assume that no neutrino emission will occur,
then the kinetic energy of the emitted electron, Ek (which must be equal to
the Q-value of the reaction[11],[12]), will be given by

Ek = H(d)
= md v2

H(u)
mu v2
u,

−
d −

where md and mu are the relativistic masses of the down and up quarks, re-
spectively, and vd, vu are their respective velocities inside the nucleus. Since
it is practically observed that the recoil energy of the nucleus is negligible,
then the kinetic energies of the down and up quarks (that is, the kinetic en-
ergies before and after the emission) must be approximately equal. Further,
since the rest masses of the down and up quarks are known to be very nearly
equal[12], then the velocities vd and vu can be considered to be approximately
equal without introducing a signiﬁcant error. In addition, the diﬀerence in
the relativistic masses (md
mu) must be equal to the apparent mass deﬁcit
−
∆m of the nucleus. Hence Eq.(72) can be reduced to

where v is the velocity of either quark inside the nucleus. We can now clearly
see that the electron’s kinetic energy will be a variable that depends on the
∆mc2. Usually, quark momenta are
quark’s velocity. If v

observed experimentally by means of transverse hadron jets in detectors like
the CERN UA2 detector. Observance of such jets did in fact conﬁrm that
quark velocities will vary from 0 up to values very close to c. Moreover, plots
of transverse hadron momenta[23],[24] show very strong resemblance with the
kinetic energy plots usually obtained in the beta-decay experiments. These
facts of course lead to the conclusion that Eq.(73) is in agreement with the
experimental beta-decay data; that is, the fact that Ek does vary from 0 up to
the theoretical maximum ∆mc2 with a distribution that does correlate with
the distribution of quark velocities is a fact that can be seen from Eq.(73).
These facts also explain why Eq.(70) is valid, even though we have assumed
that no neutrino is present.

The above result shows that a neutrino is not likely to be generated in the
ordinary process of radioactive beta-decay. The situation is diﬀerent, how-
ever, in high-energy nuclear reactions. In the sun, for example, neutrinos are
thought to be generated in the principal reaction[13]

p + p

→

2H + e+ + νe

(74)

We must now realize that such a reaction cannot be understood by simply
comparing the rest-masses of the particles involved. A more accurate repre-
sentation of the reaction, that takes velocities into account, will be written
as

2mpv2

p = mHv2

H + mev2

e + Missing Energy,

(75)

where the subscripts p, H and e denote the proton, the deuteron and the
positron, respectively. Unfortunately, unless the velocities of those particles
are determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy, calculating the amount
of missing energy will be very diﬃcult. If in fact the equation does balance
without the missing energy term, then no neutrino will result. Otherwise,
the missing energy will appear in the form of a neutrino. This can be a very
plausible explanation for the phenomenon of the shortfall in the solar neutri-
nos. Of course, more work needs to be done in the future to obtain accurate
estimates of the velocities of the particles involved in the solar reactions.

8 Summary and conclusions:

From the presented analysis, there is little evidence to argue against the fact
that wave mechanics predicts that the total energy of a particle must be given
by the quantity mv2. On the other hand, we have clearly seen that Einstein’s
relativistic treatment of energy can be interpreted in two ways, depending
essentially on how the integration of the basic kinetic energy equation is per-
formed. According to the procedure that Einstein used in the integration,
he was led to the formula Ek = mc2
m0c2, from which he concluded that
−
the total energy is mc2. Doing the integration diﬀerently, however, leads us
to the conclusion that the total energy is mv2, while maintaining the numer-
ical value of Einstein’s integral. These facts therefore suggest that, for wave
mechanics to be consistent with relativity, the expression H = mv2 must be
used as the total energy formula. We have shown that this formula can cor-
rect a substantial problem in Dirac’s theory of the electron, speciﬁcally, the
fact that Dirac’s calculation of the velocity resulted in a value that does not
correlate with physical reality. We have also shown that this formula results
in a theoretical prediction of the energy released from nuclear ﬁssion that is
in very good agreement with the actual measured value. This last fact is a
proof that the formula is indeed distinguishable from currently known exper-
imental data. The other problems that were enumerated in Sec.1 can also be
now understood in light of this result. We have commented on the process
of beta-decay and oﬀered a very plausible explanation for the phenomenon
of the shortfall in the solar neutrinos.

Having reached the above conclusion, we must not forget, however, that
there is a sizeable record of experimental evidence that does support the pre-
dictions of the theory of special relativity [32],[33],[34],[35]. The author fully
supports the theory, as far as those experimental facts are considered. For
instance, the principles of relativity of time, relativity of mass, etc., are all
valid principles in the opinion of the author. What is being questioned here
is the old understanding of the mass-energy equivalence principle in view of
the reasons mentioned above.

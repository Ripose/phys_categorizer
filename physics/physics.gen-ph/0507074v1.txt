A simpliﬁed version of the solutions to algebraic equations is presented. In previ-
ous work, a generating function to sets of these equations is derived via the geodesic
ﬂow on potentially singular manifolds [1]. The general solution to these geodesic equa-
tions dictates solutions to polynomial equations not only in the integer and rational
ﬁelds, but also in irrational and transcendental ones. The work [1] is not reviewed
here. There is formalism related to the work in [2] and [3] both in number theory and
an implementation in scalar ﬁeld theory.

The solution set to the elliptic equation in

y2 = x3 + ax + b ,

(1)

and in general the hyperelliptic equations, as well as systems of coupled polynomial
equations, is of interest for many reasons. The counting of these solutions can be
done not only in the order set (the number) but of the number type.

The solution set to the equation can be found from doubling the curve in (1) with
an anti-holomorphic counterpart, ﬁnding the metric on the space which is dependent
only on a and b, and generating the geodesic ﬂows from a known solution such as
y2 = b and x = 0 for b equaling a square.

The geodesic ﬂow equations are represented by the two equations,

m0 = f (τ ; m, n)

n0 = g(τ ; m, n) ,

(2)

together with their redundant conjugate equations. These equations require the met-
ric on the elliptic curve in order to analyze, and the singularites label all of the
disallowed integers m and n; the latter represent non-allowed solutions to the curve.
Systems of equations such as a hyperelliptic ones, or coupled equations in multi-
variables can be analyzed in the same way.

The diﬀerential representation in (2) has a formal power series expansion,

m0 = X ap(m, n)τ p

n0 = X bq(m, n)τ q .

(3)

This series has to be analyzed, given the metric data, for the existence of a τ given a
trivial solution such as m0 = n0 = 0. One condition is that one pair of the roots, pair
meaning a root from both equations in (3), has to be real, non-zero, and identical.
The coeﬃcients ap(m, n) and bq(m, n) are derived from the metric data on the four-
dimensional holomorphic and anti-holomorphic elliptic curves. In general, however,

2

the full functional dependence on τ in (3) should be analyzed including a possible
analytic continuation (e.g. hypergeometric functions for example).

The group of integers are set into the polynomial equation

Q(x, m) = Y(x − X
n=0

h(m, n)) .

Another polynomial P (x, m) can be deﬁned which represents the complement set of
integers, i.e. the allowed solution set to the elliptic equation,

The polynomial in (5) generates all of the integer, or in general rational number
solutions to the the curve,

P (x, m) = Qm=0(x − m)

.

Q(x, m)

y2 = x3 + ax + b .

The degree of the polynomial P (x, m) in (5) generates the order of the solution set
to (6).

Basically the functions

and

or

G(1)

m,n;m0,n0 = X ap(m, n)τ p − m0

G(2)

m,n;m0,n0 = X bq(m, n)τ q − n0 .

Gm,n;m0,n0 = G(1) + iG(2) ,

are required for the number of zeros and singularities. These functions are found
from the metric on the four-dimensional space spanned by the elliptic curve in (6)
and its anti-holomorphic counterpart. These functions are generalized elliptic, or Ap-
pel functions, with a further generalization to non-elliptic coupled algebraic systems
including hypergeometric ones. Standard diﬀerential or analysis techniques can ﬁnd

the zeros and inﬁnities, as well as their analytic continuations. The number of zeros
of the functions, or of the complex one Gm,n;m0,n0(τ ), are required to ﬁnd the poly-
nomial solutions to the elliptic curve in (1) and group them into the function in (5).
The latter function seems clear to derive as well as its order.

The metric on these spaces is direct to ﬁnd through a tree-level D-term analysis of
the quiver formulation [4]. These metrics are found number theoretically through the
pinching of classical φ3 diagrams, through counting their number at zero momentum
[5]. The geodesic ﬂow solutions generating these functions are one-dimensional and
are derivable [5]. General systems of polynomial equations are mapped to sets of
functions in (8) depending on their number and dimensionality, i.e. variables in x
and y. The analytic continuation, and their number of zeros and inﬁnities, count the
solutions in various number ﬁelds.

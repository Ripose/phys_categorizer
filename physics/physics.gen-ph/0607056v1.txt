In electromagnetism, the vacuum impedance Z0 is a universal constant, which is as important
as the velocity of light c in vacuum. Unfortunately, however, its signiﬁcance does not seem to be
appreciated so well and sometimes the presence itself is ignored. It is partly because in the Gaussian
system of units, which has widely been used for long time, Z0 is a dimensionless constant and of unit
magnitude. In this paper, we clarify that Z0 is a fundamental parameter in electromagnetism and
plays major roles in the following scenes: reorganizing the structure of the electromagnetic formula
in reference to the relativity; renormalizing the quantities toward natural unit systems starting from
the SI unit system; and deﬁning the magnitudes of electromagnetic units.

INTRODUCTION

The notion of vacuum impedance was introduced in
late 1930’s by Schelkunoﬀ1 in the study of wave prop-

electric and magnetic ﬁelds of plane waves in vacuum,
Z0 = E/H, which has the dimension of electrical resis-
tance.
It is also called the characteristic impedance of
vacuum or the wave resistance of vacuum. Due to the
historical reasons, it has been recognized as a special pa-
rameter for engineers rather than a universal physical
constant. Compared with the famous formula for the ve-
locity of light in terms of the vacuum permittivity ε0 and
the vacuum permeability µ0,

is used far less often. It is obvious when you look up in-
dex pages of textbooks on electromagnetism. A possible
reason is perhaps that the Gaussian system of units, in
which Z0 is a dimensionless constant and of unit magni-
tude, has been used for long time.

In this paper, we reexamine the structure of electro-
magnetism in view of the SI (The International System
of Units) system and ﬁnd that Z0 plays very important
roles as a universal constant.
In this process we also
ﬁnd that a wide-spread belief that the Gaussian system
of units is akin to natural unit systems and suitable for
theoretical studies is not correct.

II. RELATIVISTIC PAIRS OF VARIABLES

In relativity, the space variable x and the time variable
t are combined to form a 4-vector (ct, x). The constant
c, which has the dimension of velocity, serves as a factor
matching the dimensions of time and space. When we

introduce a normalized variable τ
simpliﬁed as (τ, x).

≡

ct, the 4-vector is

In this form, space and time are represented by the
same dimension. This can be done oﬀhandedly by set-
ting c = 1. It should be noted, however, this procedure
is irreversible and the dimension for time is lost. There c
becomes dimensionless. It is better to introduce normal-
ized quantities such as τ when we compare the diﬀerent
systems of units.

sionless (just a pure number), we write X

We have seen that the constant c appears when we
form a relativistic tensor from a pair of non-relativistic
electromagnetic quantities. In Table I, such relativistic

ture of electromagnetism.3,4

III. ROLES OF THE VACUUM IMPEDANCE

In this section we show some examples for which Z0

plays important roles.

a. Source-ﬁeld relation We know that the scalar po-

tential ∆φ induced by a charge ∆q = ̺∆v is

where r is the distance between the source and the point
of observation The charge is presented as a product of
charge density ̺ and a small volume ∆v. Similarly a
current moment (current by length) J∆v generates the
vector potential

∆φ =

̺∆v

∆A =

.

Considering the relations (3) and (4), these equations can
be united as

∆φ
∆(cA)(cid:21)
(cid:20)

=

4πr (cid:20)

c̺
J (cid:21)

∆v.

We see that the vacuum impedance Z0 plays the role
to relate the source (J , c̺)∆v and the resultant ﬁelds
∆(φ, cA) in a uniﬁed manner.

b. Constitutional relation A similar role can be seen
for the constitutional relations for vacuum; D = ε0E and

More precisely, with Hodge’s star operator “

∗

” (see

(E, cB) =

Z0(H, cD).

∗
It should be noted that the electric relation and the mag-
netic relation are united under the sole parameter Z0.

c. Plane wave For linearly polarlized plane waves in
vacuum, a simple relation E = cB holds. If we introduce
−1
H (= µ
0 B) instead of B, we have E = Z0H. The latter
relation was introduced by Schelkunoﬀ1 in 1938. The
reason why H is used instead of B is as follows. The
boundary conditions for magnetic ﬁelds at the interface
of media 1 and 2 are H1t = H2t (tangential) and B1n =
B2n (normal). For the case of normal incidence, which is
most important practically, the latter condition becomes
trivial and cannot be used. Therefore H is used more
conveniently. The mixed use of the quantities (E and H)
of the F and S series invite Z0 unintentionally.

D

d. Magnetic monopole Let us compare the force
between charges q and that between the magnetic
monopoles g (
Vs = Wb). If these forces are the same
for equal distances r, i.e., q2/(4πε0r2) = g2/(4πµ0r2), we
have the relation g = Z0q. With this relation in mind,
the Dirac monopole g0, whose quantization condition is
g0e = h, can be beautifully expressed in terms of the
elementary charge e as

∼

g0 =

=

h
e

h
Z0e2 (Z0e) = (2α)

−1Z0e

(10)

where h = 2π~ is Planck’s constant. The dimensionless
parameter α = Z0e2/2h = e2/4πε0~c
1/137 is called
the ﬁne structure constant, whose value is independent
of unit systems and characterize the strength of the elec-
tromagnetic interaction. The use of Z0 helps to keep
SI-formulae in simple forms.

∼

e. The F series versus the S series

Impedance (re-
sistance) is a physical quantity by which voltage and cur-
rent are related.7 In the SI system, the unit for voltage
is V(= J/C) (volt) and the unit for current is A(= C/s)
(ampere). We should note that the latter is proportional
to and the former is inversely proportional to the unit of
charge, C (coulomb). We also note in Table I that the
units for quantities in the F series are proportional to the
volt and those in the S series are proportional to the am-
pere. After all, the vacuum impedance Z0 plays the role
to connect the quantities in the F and S series. In the
above cases we have found that the use of Z0 (together
with c) instead of ε0 or µ0 simpliﬁes equations.

IV. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE UNIT OF
RESISTANCE

Here we consider a hypothetical situation where we
are allowed to redeﬁne the magnitudes of units in elec-
tromagnetism.

The product of the unit of voltage and that of current
1 A = 1 W = 1 J/s,

should yield the unit of power, 1 V

V. TOWARD NATURAL UNIT SYSTEMS

As shown in Table II (a), by introducing a new set of
normalized quantities, ˜X = cX, derived from SI quanti-
ties X, we can reduce the number of fundamental dimen-
sions. In this case, we only need three; the ampere, the
volt, and the meter.

Further, as seen in Table II (b), when we introduce a
set of normalized quantities, X ∗ = Z0X, by multiplying
Z0, only the volt and the meter are required. By nor-
malizing the quantities with the fundamental constants,
c and Z0, we have a simpliﬁed set of Maxwell’s equations:

stressed that a natural system of units can be reached
from the SI system by normalizations without detouring
via the Gaussian system.

The number of basic units has been reduced from four

normalized with c and Z0. For further reduction toward
a natural unit system,8,9 ~ and the gravitational constant

The SI and the cgs (esu, emu, Gaussian) systems diﬀer
in three respects. First, in the cgs unit systems, no fun-
damental dimensions are supplemented to the three fun-
damental dimensions for mechanics; length, mass, and
time. On the other hand in the SI (MKSA) system, a
new fundamental dimension that for electric current is
introduced. The cgs systems contain three basic units,
while the SI system contains four.

Secondly, the cgs systems are irrational systems; the
factor (1/4π) is erased from Coulomb’s law but the fac-
tor 4π appears in the source terms of Maxwell’s equations
instead. The SI is a rational system, which has the op-
posite appearance.

Thirdly, the base mechanical system for the cgs sys-
tems is the cgs (centimeter, gram, and second) mechan-
ical system. That for the SI system is the MKS (meter,
kilogram, and second) system.

In order to focus all our attention on the ﬁrst respect,
i.e., the number of basic units, we will ignore the diﬀer-
ences in the last two respects. From now on, we pre-
tend that all the cgs systems (esu, emu, and Gaussian)
are constructed rationally on the MKS mechanical sys-
tem. (Actually the Heaviside-Lorentz system is an MKS
version of the Gaussian system, namely, a three-unit, ra-
tional system based on the MKS system.)

To go from the SI system to the cgs systems, we have to
reduce the number of basic units by normalization with
a universal constant.

For the cgs electromagnetic system of units (emu), S-

magnetic force between currents. The ﬁelds are normal-

The Gaussian system of units is a combination of the
esu and emu systems. For electrical quantities the esu
normalization is used and for magnetic quantities the
emu normalization is used. Namely we use ˆE, ˆD, ´B,
and ´H, all of which have the dimension √N/m. The
constitutional relations are simpliﬁed as

ˆD = ˆE,

´H = ´B,

(26)

and we have ˆε0 = 1 and ´µ0 = 1. So far it looks nice be-
cause electric and magnetic quantities are treated sym-
metrically. This appearence is the reason why the Gaus-
sian system has been used so widely. However, there is
an overlooked problem in the normalization of current
density. It is normalized as ˆJ = J /√ε0 in the Gaussian
system. The current density is the quantity primarily
connected to magnetic ﬁelds and therefore it should be

normalized as ´J = J√µ0 as for the emu system. Be-
cause of this miscasting, we have an irregularity in the
fourth row of the column (c) of Table II. The Gaussian
normalization happens to make the pairs of quantities
relativistic with exception of the (J , ̺) pair.

The relativistic expression for the conservation of

The factor 1/c in the current density term is a seam in-
troduced when the esu and emu systems are joined into
the Gaussian system.

The common belief that the Gaussian system is supe-
rior to the SI system because of the similarity to a natural
unit system or because of the compatibility with relativ-
ity is almost pointless. We should remember that the
Gaussian unit system was established in 1870s, when the
relativity or the Lorentz transformation were not known
yet.

The modiﬁed Gaussian system,11 in which ´J is adopted
and the above seam is eliminated, has been proposed but
is rarely used. Column (d) of Table II contains quantities
in the modiﬁed Gaussian system. They diﬀer uniformly
by a factor √ε0 from the (c, Z0)-normalized quantities in
Column (b).

the emu system when he found that light is an electro-
magnetic disturbance propagated according to electro-
magnetic laws.12 For the emu system the dimensions of
resistance and velocity are degenerate. For the Gaus-
sian system, the vacuum impedance reduces to unity,

´µ0/ˆε0 = 1.
Thus there is no room for the vacuum impedance in
p
the cgs systems, which contains only three basic units.
However when we move to a unit system with four basic
units, the vacuum impedance Z0 should be recognized as
a fundamental constant as important as the velocity of
light c. It has been underestimated or ignored for long
time.
It is due to the fact that the Gaussian system,
for which Z0 is dimensionless and of unit magnitude, has
been used for long time even after the introduction of the
MKSA and the SI systems.

As has been pointed out by Sommerfeld,3 the Gaus-
sian system tends to veil the signiﬁcance of D and H in
vacuum. Sometimes it is told that in vacuum only E
and B have their signiﬁcance and D and H lose their
meaning. This argument is strongly misled by the use
of Gaussian system of units. Considering the tensorial
nature of quantities as in (9), the constitutional relations
for the Gaussian system are expressed as

( ˆE, ´B) =

( ´H, ˆD).

with Hodge’s star operator. This relation represents im-
portant geometrical relations of electromagnetic ﬁelds,
which can hardly be suggested by the simple vector rela-
tions (26).

Now we have understood that without the help of
Gaussian system, we can reach natural systems of units
directly from the SI system. We believe it’s time to say
goodbye to the Gaussian system of units. You won’t miss
its simpleness if you have the vacuum impedance Z0 as
a key parameter.

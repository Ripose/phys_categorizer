Abstract

The principle of zero-total energy of the Universe implies several relations among the mass M

, the radius R and the angular momentum L of a ”large” sphere representing a Machian

Universe. By calculating the angular speed, we ﬁnd a peculiar centripetal acceleration for the

Universe. This is an ubiquituous property that relates one observer to any observable. It turns

out that this is exactly the anomalous acceleration observed on the Pioneers spaceships. We have

thus, shown that this anomaly is to be considered a property of the Machian Universe.

THE PIONEER ANOMALY AND A MACHIAN
UNIVERSE

Marcelo Samuel Berman

Berman(2006b), proposes that Mach’s Principle, means a zero-total energy Universe.

Berman(2006; 2006a), has shown this meaning of Mach’s Principle without considering a

rotating Universe. We now extend the model, in order to include the spin of the Universe,
∼ 1 , with two diﬀerent relations,
and we replace Brans-Dicke traditional relation, GM
c2R

which we call the Brans-Dicke relations for gravitation, and for the spin of the Universe.

We shall consider a ”large” sphere, with mass M , radius R , spin L .

We now calculate the total energy E of this distribution:

E = Ei + Eg + EL

,

(1)

where Ei = Mc2

, stands for the inertial (Special Relativistic) energy; Eg

(the Newtonian gravitational potential self-energy); EL

∼
= − GM 2
the Newtonian rotational

R

∼
= L2
M R2

energy.

If we impose that the total energy is equal to zero, i.e., E = 0 , we obtain from (1):

GM
c2R

− L2

M 2c2R2

∼
= 1

.

As relation(2) above should be valid for the whole Universe, and not only for a speciﬁc

instant of time, in the life of the Universe, and if this is not a coincidental relation, we can

solve this equation by imposing that:

GM
c2R = γG

∼
= 2

L
M cR = γL

∼
= 1

,

,

subject to the condition,

γG − γ2
L

∼
= 1

,

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

where the γ′s are constants having a near unity value.

We now derive the following generalized Brans-Dicke relations, for gravitation and spin:

GM
c2R = γG

∼
= 2

GL
c3R2 = γL

∼
= 1

,

,

(3)

(6)

Instead of deriving the above Brans-Dicke relations, by means of the zero-total energy

principle, coupled to the hypothesis that each term should be valid, not only for the present

Universe but also along all the history, since Planck’s Universe, Sabbata and Sivaram(1994)

derived the B.D. relation for spin, as has been derived, but on a heuristic procedure, which

consists on the simple hypothesis that L should obey a similar relation as M .

We notice that R ∝ M , and L ∝ R2 , in case γG and γL are really constants.

It must be remarked, that our proposed law (3), is a radical departure from the original

Brans-Dicke (Brans and Dicke, 1961) relation, which was an approximate one, valid for the
present Universe, while our present exact hypotheses implies that R ∝ M , and L ∝ R2

, for the entire span of the Universe’s history.

With the present hypothesis, one can show, that independently of the particular gravita-
tional theory taken as valid, the energy density of the Universe obeys a R−2 dependence

(see Berman, 2006; 2006a; Berman and Marinho, 2001). In fact, from the deﬁnition:

,

ρ = M
V

while,

V = αR3

,

( α = constant )

ρ =

γG
G α(cid:3)

(cid:2)

R−2

.

(7)

(8)

(9)

where ρ and V stand for energy density and tridimensional volume, we ﬁnd:

If we apply the above relation, for Planck’s and the present Universe, we ﬁnd:

3

−2

ρ

ρP l = h

R
RP l i

.

(10)

If we substitute the known values for Planck’s quantities, while we take for the present
∼
= 1028 cm, we ﬁnd a reasonable result for the present energy density. This

Universe, R

shows that our result (relation 9), has to be given credit.

It should be remembered that the origin of Planck’s quantities, say, for length, time,

density and mass, were obtained by means of dimensional combinations among the constants

for macrophysics (G for gravitation and c for electromagnetism) and for Quantum Physics

(Planck’s constant h

2π ). Analogously, if we would demand a dimensionaly correct Planck’s

spin, obviously we would ﬁnd,

LP l = h
2π

.

L = LP l

.

of the Universe,

This is exactly what we would obtain from (6), when we plug RP l for R , and obtaining

From Brans-Dicke relation for spin, we now can obtain the present angular momentum

L = LP l h

R
RP l i

2 ∼

= 10120

h

(cid:0)

= 1093

g cm2 s−1

.

(12)

This estimate was also made by Sabbata and Sivaram(1994), based on heuristic consid-

erations(see also Sabbata and Gasperini, 1979).

Sabbata and Gasperini(1979), have calculated the angular speed, for the present Universe.

Though they mixed their calculations with some results obtained from Dirac’s LNH (Large

Number Hypothesis), including a time variation for the gravitational ”constant”, we now

show that, if we take for granted that G = constant, and by means of the generalized

Brans-Dicke relations we ﬁnd, by considering a rigid rotating Universe, whereby:

(11)

(13)

L = MR2ω

,

so that,

4

Mω = constant

, ( because L ∝ R2

as we have shown earlier ), we shall have:

ωP l = c

RP l = 2 x 1043 s−1

,

and, for the present,

ω = c
R

∼
= 3 x 10−18 s−1

.

(14)

(15)

Sabbata and Gasperini(1979), pointed out that the same numerical angular speed is

obtained for G¨odel’s Universe, and also for the Sun’s peculiar velocity through the cosmic

microwave background.

We remark that γG

∼
= 2 is to be exact and not approximate, if we consider the result by

Adler et al (1975), for the energy of a spherical mass, obtained by means of pseudotensors.

The Pioneers’ anomaly,

is described by a centripetal acceleration of an up to now unex-

plained nature, which aﬀects two spaceships launched on opposite directions, which are by
now in the outskirts of the Solar system. Its value is a′ ∼

= −8 x 10−8cm/ sec2 .

For a Machian Universe, taken care of result (15),we can obtain the value for an ubiqui-

tuous centripetal acceleration,

a = −ω2R

.

If R

∼
= 1028cm , as is known for the causally related Universe, we ﬁnd:

a = −9 x 10−8cm/ sec2 ∼

= a′

.

(16)

(17)

It is necessary to point out that, for a Machian Universe, we should have this extra

acceleration, along the direction pointing from the observed to the observer. It aﬀects any

two pairs of, observer versus observed, points in space. The striking match between

a
a′ must point to a possible solution to the Pioneers’ anomaly; the only necessary

and

hypothesis is that the Universe is endowed with the Machian properties shown above.

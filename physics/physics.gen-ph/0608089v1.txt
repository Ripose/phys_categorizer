Abstrat

The onept of elementary partile rests on the idea that it is a physial system with no

exited states, so that all possible states of the partile are just kinematial modi(cid:28)ations of any

one of them. In this way instead of desribing the partile attributes it amounts to desribe the

olletion of onseutive inertial observers who desribe the partile in the same kinematial

state. The kinematial state spae of an elementary partile is a homogeneous spae of the

kinematial group. By onsidering the largest homogeneous spaes of both, Galilei and Poinaré

groups, it is shown how the spin struture is related to the di(cid:27)erent degrees of freedom. Finally,

the spaetime symmetry group of a relativisti partile whih satis(cid:28)es Dira's equation when

quantized, is enlarged to take into aount additional symmetries like spaetime dilations and

loal rotations. An interation Lagrangian invariant under this enlarged group is proposed and

the ompound system of two Dira partiles is analyzed.

1 Introdution

We are going to disuss within the kinematial formalism developped by the author, the

interation Lagrangian for two spin 1/2 Dira partiles.

In order to make the ontribution

selfontained we shall desribe in setion 2 the main theoretial onsiderations whih lead to

the de(cid:28)nition of a lassial elementary partile. This de(cid:28)nition also applies to the spinless point

partile but in general desribe systems whih ontain some more variables, suh that the usual

lassial mehanis mahinery will produe the de(cid:28)nition of spin in terms of these additional

variables. The formalism is a variational formalism whih is quantized under Feynman's path

integral method.

It makes a predition onerning the eletromagneti dipole struture of

partiles and antipartiles in suh a way that spin and magneti moment must have the same

relative orientation for matter and antimatter. Two plausible experiments are proposed to

determine this relative orientation.

In setion 3 we disuss the enlargement of the spaetime symmetry group to inlude also

spaetime dilations and loal rotations and the relationship of the new spaetime symmetry

group with the standard model. Finally, in setion 4 we desribe the interation Lagrangian

for a system of two interating Dira's partiles whih is obtained under the assumption that

the intrinsi struture of an elementary partile is not modi(cid:28)ed by any interation. With this

Lagrangian we analyze the interation of two partiles and the possibility of formation of bound

pairs of equal harged partiles provided some boundary onditions are ful(cid:28)lled.

2 Kinematial formalism

We all the present approah a kinematial formalism beause the spaetime symmetry

group of the theory, the kinematial group, not only supplies the symmetries, and therefore the

onserved observables of the system, but also its group parameters, ompat and non ompat,

will be transformed into the lassial variables we need to desribe the elementary systems [1℄.

Classial elementary partiles are loalized and orientable systems. By this we mean that the

position of the partile is desribed by the evolution of a geometrial point where all the partile

harges responsible for its interation are loated, and the orientation is desribed by attahing

a omoving artesian frame whih desribes the partile rotation. Nevertheless the position of

that point is not the enter of mass for a spinning partile, so that the motion of the harge

around the enter of mass produes the dipole struture. For a Dira partile the harge moves

at the speed of light so that it is never at rest for any inertial observer and this justi(cid:28)es the

oupling of the partile urrent with the external potentials. The partile is haraterized by

two kinds of lassial variables. Non-ompat variables like time t, position r and ompat
variables like the orientation variables α. The spin 1/2 struture of elementary partiles will

be related to ompat variables and, therefore, mathematial theorems on ompat groups will

play an important role in the quantum mehanial struture of spin.

The dynamis is based upon a variational formalism. The initial and (cid:28)nal states of the

lassial variational formalism, haraterized by what will be alled kinematial variables, will

orrespond with the initial and (cid:28)nal states of the quantum dynamial formalism. We have to

(cid:28)nd solutions passing through the end points so that we have to give a protagonism to the

kinematial variables. The Lagrangian must be rewritten in terms of these variables, instead of

the independent degrees of freedom.

We also aept the atomisti hypothesis. Matter annot be divided inde(cid:28)nitely. After a

(cid:28)nite number of steps we reah a (cid:28)nal and indivisible ob jet, i.e., an elementary partile. Real

matter does not satisfy the hypothesis of the ontinuum. An elementary partile is a mehanial

system without exited states. We an destroy it but we an never modify its struture. All

its possible states are only kinematial modi(cid:28)ations of any one of them. If the state of an

elementary partile hanges, it is always possible to (cid:28)nd another inertial observer who desribes

the partile in the same state as in the previous instant.

Any elementary system is thus a Lagrangian system whose initial and (cid:28)nal states an be

haraterized by a (cid:28)nite number of variables. By the above onsideration on the states of

an elementary partile the kinematial variables neessarily span a homogeneous spae of the

kinematial group assoiated to the restrited Relativity Priniple. The variables whih har-

aterize the lassial states of an elementary partile are thus the variables whih haraterize

the possible parameterizations of the kinematial group of spae-time transformations.

The advantage of this formulation is that we an obtain general expressions for the onserved

quantities in terms of the above Fi(x, ˙x) funtions, and their time derivatives, whih are homo-
geneous funtions of zero-th degree of the variables ˙xi and of the way the kinematial variables
transform Mjα(x).

The quantization leads to the following results:[2℄

1. If x are the kinematial variables of the variational approah, Feynman's kernel K(x1, x2)

whih desribes the probability amplitude for the evolution of the system between the

initial point x1 to the (cid:28)nal point x2 , is only a funtion (more properly a distribution) of

the end point kinematial variables.

2. The wave funtion of the quantized system is a omplex squared integrable funtion of

these variables Φ(x), with respet to some suitable invariant measure over the kinematial

spae.

3. The wave funtion transforms under the kinematial group

Φ′(x) = U (g)Φ(x) = Φ(g−1x)e−iα(g−1;x)/¯h

with a pro jetive unitary irreduible representation of the kinematial group.

4. If G is a symmetry group of parameters gα

variables in the form:

, whih transform in(cid:28)nitesimally the kinematial

the representation of the generators is given by the self-adjoint operators (¯h = 1)

5. Quantum theory is not a hidden variable theory beause it desribes the quantum states

in terms of a wave funtion whih depends on exatly the same lassial variables as the

lassial mehanis does.

and thus no lassial information is lost in the proess of quantization.

In our model of the Dira partile, the kinematial variables are time t, the position of the
harge r, the veloity of the harge u with the onstraint u = c, and, (cid:28)nally the orientation of the
partile α desribed by a suitable parameterization of the rotation group and whih desribes
the orientation of a loal body frame attahed to the point r. Aording to the homogeneity

ondition (1) the general form of the Lagrangian is

where T = ∂L/∂ ˙t, R = ∂L/∂ ˙r, U = ∂L/∂ ˙u and W = ∂L/∂ω . All onserved quantities

time derivatives.

We see that the Lagrangian depends up to the aeleration of the point r and therefore

dynamial equations for the motion of this point are fourth order di(cid:27)erentail equations [4℄. The

whih is not onserved beause P and u are not ollinear vetors. This is the same dynamial

equation satis(cid:28)ed by Dira's spin operator in the quantum ase. We thus see that our spin

observable S represents the angular momentum of the partile with respet to the harge position
r and not with respet to the enter of mass q. This is one of the reasons why this magnitude

is not a onserved one even for a free partile. Is is only onserved in the entre of mass frame,

where P = 0.

The wave funtion beomes a omplex squared integrable funtion de(cid:28)ned on the kinematial

spae Φ(t, r, u, α). The Poinaré group unitary realization over the orresponding Hilbert spae

has the usual selfadjoint generators. They are represented by the di(cid:27)erential operators, with

positive energy partile is of negative harge we obtain the dipole struture of the partile and

antipartile as depited in Fig.2. If the partile is of positive harge we obtain the opposite

relative orientation. This inde(cid:28)niteness in the sign of the harge of matter is also present in

Dira's formalism. This predition is onsistent with the known strutures formed by a partile

and the orresponding antipartile. The positronium is an unstable bound state between an

eletron and a positron. The ground state, the singlet parapositronium state, is of zero spin

and zero magneti moment, thus justifying that partile and antipartile have the same relative

orientation between the spin and magneti moment. In the ase of the bound system q ¯q betweeen
two quarks we have the π0
represented as a linear ombination of u¯u, and d ¯d quarks and antiquarks.

whih is a zero spin and zero magneti moment partile whih is

Nevertheless, the theory does not predit the relative orientation beause does not (cid:28)x the sign

of the harge of the partile, as in Dira's formalism. This has to be measured experimentaly.

In our opinion this feature has not been measured and we propose two plausible experiments

to establish their relative orientation.

2.2 Two plausible experiments

We propose an experiment for the measurement of the relative orientation between S and
µ for an eletron bound in a Rb atom. Rb
atom has a 5s outer eletron. Its nuleus has
spin 3/2 and the ground state of the atom orresponds to a system of total spin 1, with the

87

spin of the outer eletron opposite to that of the nuleus. The magneti moment of the atom is

basially the magneti moment of the outer eletron. Ultraold atoms in an external magneti

(cid:28)eld will orient their magneti moments along the diretion of the (cid:28)eld.

If we send in this diretion irularly polarized photons of suh an energy to produe the

hyper(cid:28)ne transition whih (cid:29)ips the spin of the eletron to the opposite orientation, and therefore

the atom goes into a total spin 2 state, then only those photons with a spin opposite to the

outer eletron will be absorbed.

Another experiment is the measurement of the preession diretion of the spin of e+
and of µ+

in a storage ring. If e+

and µ−

and µ−

and µ+

and e−

e−

have the same relative

and

orientation between spin and magneti moment, then the torque and thus the preession will

7

be the same.

B =

dS
dt

Nevertheless, if we injet into the aelerator partiles and antipartiles with the spin up, and

beause the magneti (cid:28)eld of the ring has to be reversed for the antipartile, then the preession

diretion of both beams will be opposite to eah other. If it is possible to detet the preession

diretion this will on(cid:28)rm the predition and also the relative orientation between spin and

magneti moment.

3 More spaetime symmetries

The wave funtion is a funtion of the kinematial variables

Φ(t, r;

θ,

φ, α, θ, φ) =

ψi(t, r)Φi(

θ,

, so that the 9 kinematial variables of a Dira partile an be taken dimensionless

from the lassial point of view. The length sale is the radius of the internal motion and the

time sale the time taken during a omplete turn of the harge.

This means that this system, in addition to the Poinaré group, it also has as a symmetry

group the spae-time dilations whih do not hange the speed of light

t′ = eλt,

r′ = eλr, u′ = u, α′ = α.

The spin is the only intrinsi property of this elementary partile.

The rotation group ats on the kinematial variables in the way:

t′ = t,

r′ = R(µ)r, u′ = R(µ)u, R(α′) = R(µ)R(α).

But the orientation variables α are arbitrary, so that we an also have another loal rotation

body frame transformations

t′ = t,

r′ = r, u′ = u, R(α′) = R(β)R(α).

This orresponds to the ative rotation of the body frame ei , i = 1, 2, 3. The generators of these

rotations are the spin pro jetions on the body frame, i.e. the Ti = ei ·

Beause the spin has the form S = Z + W and quantizes with s = 1/2 while W quantizes

with w = 1/2, the zitterbewegung part Z quantizes with z = 0 or z = 1.

There are thus two kinds of Dira's partiles aording to the two possible Z eigenvalues.

terbewegung angular momentum Z as representing olor, the above Dira partile with the

• A partile of spin 1/2 and of isospin 1/2 of arbitrary nonvanishing mass and arbitrary

harge.

3.2 Larger kinematial spae

One we have a larger kinematial group we an have a larger kinematial spae. The new

kinematial variable β assoiated to the spaetime dilation orresponds to half the phase of the

internal zitterbewegung motion.

The Lagrangian is now, instead of (2), of the general form

L0 = ˙tT + ˙r

R + ˙u

U + ω

W + B ˙β,

that in the enter of mass frame

We nedd the extra variable β of the enlarged kinematial group in order to still satisfy Dira's

equation.

4 The interation Lagrangian

The kinematial spae of two Dira partiles is spanned by the variables

ta, ra, βa, ua, αa}
,
{

a = 1, 2.

We assume that the Lagrangian whih desribes the ompound system is of the form L =
L1 + L2 + LI .

10

Beause the spin is the only intrinsi property of an elementary partile and annot be

modi(cid:28)ed by any interation, the interation Lagrangian LI annot be a funtion of

˙ua and
˙αa or equivalently ωa . If it is going to be invariant under the loal SU (2) group of loal
rotations, then it has to be also independent of αa . Otherwise the spin de(cid:28)nition of eah partile

of

will be modi(cid:28)ed. If it is also invariant under spaetime dilations, must be independent of the

βa . The spin de(cid:28)nition remains the same as in the free ase

Sa = ua ×

∂La
∂ ˙ua

+

∂La
∂ωa

= Za + Wa,

a = 1, 2.

The interation Lagrangian will thus be a funtion of

LI = LI (ta, ra, ˙ta, ˙ra),

and beause of (1) a homogeneous funtion of (cid:28)rst degree of the derivatives ˙ta, ˙ra , a = 1, 2. If
SU (2), if we all xµ

(ta, ra), then we get

it is going to be invariant under W ⊗

One an inertial observer is (cid:28)xed it an make a synhronous time desription, i.e. to use as

τ .

An average over the harge position and veloity in the enter of mass of one of the partiles

imply that the interation beomes the instantaneous Coulomb interation, between the enter

of mass of the (cid:28)rst partile (whih is also the average position of its harge) and the harge

position of the other. The average over the other then orresponds to the interation of two

spinless point partiles when the spin struture is negleted.

oming from the same initial position as the orresponding enter of mass, provided the two

partiles do not approah eah other below Compton's wavelength. For higher energy proesses

the satering of the spinning partiles shows a more detailed struture whih depends also on

the relative phases of the internal motion of eah harge.

In Fig.4 we also depit the bound motion of the two equal harged partiles with parallel

spins. The initial position is below Compton's wavelength. The veloity of eah partile must

If we try to produe

this bound state by a pure ollision we need a greater kineti energy to overome the repulsion

and the bound state is unstable. But if we think in two onduting eletrons in a lattie, the

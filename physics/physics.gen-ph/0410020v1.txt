ABSTRACT

The generalized deﬁnition of symmetry is formu-
lated. Application of this deﬁnition for symmet-
ric analysis of theoretical physics equations is con-
sidered. The version of electrodynamics is con-
structed permitting the faster-than-light motions
of particles with real masses. Some elements of
physical interpretation of the proposed theory are
presented.

Keywords: Symmetries, Relativity Principle,
Velocity of Light, Faster-Than-Light Motion

1.INTRODUCTION

The study on the symmetric properties of the-
oretical and mathematical physics equations is
a standard and important task of scientiﬁc re-
search. It is connected with the fact that the sym-
metric properties of theoretical physics equations
contain fundamental information on the proper-
ties of the world around. As an illustration we
shall dwell on three examples.

Let us consider the Newton dynamics equation

(1687)

ma = F,

(1)

where m is the mass of a particle, a is the ac-
celeration, F is the force acting on a particle. It
is well-known that the equation is invariant with
respect to the Galilei space-time transformations

x′ = x − V t, y′ = y, z′ = z, t′ = t,

(2)

where c′ = c(1 − 2βnx + β2)1/2 is the law of
transformation of the velocity of light c with re-
spect to transformations (2), β = V /c, n = c/c,
(x, y, z) are the spatial variables, t is the time,
V = (V, 0, 0) is the velocity of inertial motion of
the reference frame K ′ relative to K.
It is fol-
lows from here that the space surrounding us is
3-dimensional and possesses the Euclid metric

ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2.

(3)

Time is universal at any point of space. Space is
empty and serves as arena where events have been

taking place. Space does not inﬂuence on these
events. The 3-dimensional coordinate space and
time exist independently of one another.

These concepts were kept until 1873 when

Maxwell equations were discovered

(E, H are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds re-
spectively, ρ is the electrical charge density, v is
the velocity of electrical charge, c is the speed of
light). In 1904 to 1905 in the fundamental works
of Lorentz, Einstein and Poincar´e it was shown
that the Maxwell equations are invariant with re-
spect to the Lorentz transformations

(5)

where y′ = y, z′ = z, c′ = c. The consequence
from the found symmetry is a profound change
in our ideas of space and time. Time has been
ceased to be independent. Space has become 4-
dimensional and is characterized by the pseudo-
Euclid metric

ds2 = c2dt2 − dx2 − dy2 − dz2,

(6)

into which the diﬀerentials of time and coordi-
nates enter on equal rights. The constant of the
speed of light plays a fundamental role. But
space, as in the case of classic electrodynamics,
is empty and does not exert any eﬀect on dynam-
ics of physical processes happening in it.

But in 1928 the Dirac equation was formulated

(γapa − mc)Ψ(x) =

γaAaΨ(x),

(7)

e
c

where x = (x0, x), x0 = ct, e is the electric
charge, Aa = (A0, A) is the 4-potential, γaAa =
γ0A0 − γ1A1 − γ2A2 − γ3A3, γa are the Dirac ma-
trices. It is invariant with respect to the trans-
formation of the special form C known as the
charge conjugation. This transformation is ac-
companied by the reversal of signs of electric

charge, energy and momentum. The idea of anti-
particle, positron, and Dirac electronic vacuum
comes into being. Empty space, vacuum, ceased
to be empty. Vacuum is ﬁlled with electrons at
the states with negative energies. Vacuum inﬂu-
ences on quantum-mechanical processes going on
in the real world.

These are the consequences of the physical in-
terpretation of abstract mathematical symme-
tries in theoretical physics.
It will not be
overstated if we relate the D’Alembert and the
Shr¨odinger equations to such equations. They
have extensive applications in experiment, are
well studied through the known methods of sym-
metry analysis and form, as well as the equa-
tions of Newton, Maxwell and Dirac, a basis for
modern physics. The natural question arises of
whether these equations contain something more
than what is known of them. It is not improba-
ble that they have additional symmetries which
are as signiﬁcant for physics as the ones already
found. Thus, the purpose of the present work is
the ﬁnding of additional symmetries inherent in
the equations of D’Alembert, Dirac, Maxwell and
Schr¨odinger.

2.DEFINITION OF SYMMETRY

In solving this problem, it is necessary to take into
account a number of the rigorous theorems: the
13-dimensional Schr¨odinger group Sch13 is the
maximal group of symmetry of Schr¨odinger equa-
tion in the space of classical physics (Niederer,
1972, Hagen, 1972); the 15-dimensional confor-
mal group C15 is the maximal group of symme-
try of the equations of D’Alembert and Maxwell
in the Minkowski space (Pauli, 1921).

It is essential that all these symmetries relate
to so named the Lie-type symmetries in the space
of classical physics, or in the Minkowski space.
It is follows from here that for ﬁnding the new
symmetries it is necessary either to be beyond
the space of classical physics and the Minkowski
space or to turn to the non-Lie generalized types
of symmetry. It is in this way that the new results
have been obtained. Let us turn ﬁrst to the task
of searching for the new symmetries on the base
of the generalized understanding of symmetry.

Let some linear partial diﬀerential equation
Lφ(x) = 0 be given. By symmetry of this equa-
tion we shall understand the set of Q-operators

satisfying the permutation relations of the p-th
order [L...[L, Q]...]](p
f old)φ(x) = 0 on the solu-
tions φ(x). When p = 1, this deﬁnition coincides
with the standard one (Malkin and Man’ko, 1965;
Kyriakopoulos, 1968).

−

As an illustration, let us use this deﬁnition for
the one component ﬁeld φ(x) when p = 2, and
the symmetry operators Q belong to some Lie al-
[L[L, Q]] = ζ(x)L; Q = ξa(x)∂a + η(x);
gebra:
[Ql, Qm] = ClmnQn. By substituting the expres-
sion for the Q-operator into the operator equal-
ity and by equating the coeﬃcients with the same
derivatives on the left and on the right, a set of
the determining diﬀerential equations for the un-
known functions ξa(x), η(x) and ζ(x) may be ob-
tained. Commutation properties of the operators
enable one to ﬁnd the structure constants and to
identify the algebra. On the base of this algebra,
the coordinate transformations x′ = x′(x) may be
found by integrating the Lie equations dxa′
/dθ =
ξa(x′), xa′
θ=0 = xa, (θ is the group parame-
ter). Let us determine the law of transforming the
ﬁeld function by the relation φ′(x′) = Φ(x)φ(x).
Here the weight function Φ(x) may be calculated
from the set of engaging equations AΦ(x)φ(x) =
0, Lφ(x) = 0, where the former was obtained by
replacing the variables in the initial primed equa-
tion Lφ′(x′) = 0. The compatibility of the set
AΦφ = 0, Lφ = 0 is, according to the deﬁnition,
the condition of transforming the initial equation
into itself Lφ′(x′) = 0 → (x′ = x′(x), φ′(x′) =
Φ(x)φ(x)) → AΦ(x)φ(x) = 0, Lφ(x) = 0 [1].

3.GALILEI INVARIANCE OF
MAXWELL EQUATIONS

n

iω(t

Let us apply the algorithm to the equations cho-
sen for analysis and consider ﬁrst the D’Alembert
equation. We start from the equation Lφ = ✷φ =
0 for scalar ﬁeld and the solution in the form of
x/c). The equations
plane waves φ = e−
−
and the solutions will be considered within the
space of classical physics. Let us introduce the
Galilei transformations (2) and turn to the per-
mutation relations of the Galilei transformations
generator H = t∂x with the D’Alembert operator
[✷[✷, H]] = 0. It can be seen from here that the
Galilei transformations for the D’Alembert equa-
tion are symmetry transformations of the type
p = 2. Let us do the replacement of variables
taking into account the law of ﬁeld transforma-

tion φ′ = Φφ and ﬁnd the weight function from
the condition of compatibility of the equation
AΦ(x)φ(x) = [(∂0 + β∂x)2/λ2 − △]Φφ = 0 with
the equation ✷φ(x) = 0. The weight function
takes the form

Φ(x) = e−

where n = c/c, λ = c′/c.
In this case
the D’Alembert equation transforms into itself
✷φ′(x′) = 0 → ✷φ(x) = 0 in accordance with the
standard understanding of symmetry. To Galilei
invariance of D’Alembert equation there corre-
sponds the Galilei invariance of the light cone
equation c2t2 − x2 = 0 (it can be proved by direct
calculation).

iω(t

Let us turn now to the Maxwell equations and
consider the homogeneous equations and their so-
lutions in the form of the plane waves (E, H) =
nx/c), where l, m are the polariza-
(l, m) · e−
tion vectors. Here the ﬁeld, as distinct from the
previous case, is multi-component. Therefore, we
shall search for the ﬁeld transformation law in the
more complicated form

−

E′x = Φ(x)Ex,
E′y = Φ(x)k(Ey + hyzHz),
E′z = Φ(x)k(Ez + hzyHy),
H′x = Φ(x)Hx;
H′y = Φ(x)k(Hy + eyzEz);
H′z = Φ(x)k(Hz + ezyEy).

(9)

(10)

Here Φ(x) is the weight function (8) correspond-
ing to the condition of the D’Alembert equation
invariance; k, eyz, ezy, hyz, hzy the parameters of
ﬁeld transformations. By replacing the variables,
taking into account the weight function Φ(x), we
ﬁnd a set of 8 algebraic equations for the unknown
values k, eyz, ezy, hyz, hzy. The set is compatible
and has the solutions:

k = +

nx(β − nx) + λ
1 − nx

2

,

eyz = +

hyz = −

nx(λ − 1) + β
nx(β − nx) + λ
nx(λ − 1) + β
nx(β − nx) + λ

,

,

where eyz = −ezy = hzy = −hyz. In accordance
with the generalized understanding of symmetry,
it means that the Maxwell equations are invariant
with respect to the Galilei transformations [1]. In

the limit of low velocities the formulae for ﬁeld
transformations take the form known under the
name of the Galilean limit

E′ ≈ E + βXH, H′ ≈ H − βXE.

(11)

These relationships form, in fact, the same limit
both in the relativistic and in the Galilei case.
Here the situation is similar to the situation con-
cerning the transformations of space-time vari-
ables when v ≪ c

x′ = x − V t, y′ = y, z′ = z, t′ = t, c′ = c. (12)

These transformations, being neither the Galilean
nor the relativistic transformations, are the lim-
iting relationships for both the cases.

4.LORENTZ INVARIANCE OF
SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

Let us next consider Schr¨odinger equation LSψ =
(i¯h∂t + ¯h2△/2m0)ψ(x) = 0. We start from
the generators Mok = x0∂k − xk∂0, k = 1, 2, 3
of the Lorentz transformations.
In view of
the permutation relations [LS[LS, Mok]] = 0,
the Lorentz transformations are the Schr¨odinger
equation symmetry transformations of the type
p = 2. Using it as the base, we shall extend
the Shr¨odinger equation to the relativistic do-
main of motions by introducing the relativistic
1 − β2 and the relativistic en-
mass m = m0/
ergy E = mc2 of a particle

p

(cid:16)i¯h∂t + c2¯h2 △

The equation has two solutions:

(14)

where s = v/v, x = (x, y, z), v = (vx, vy, vz) is the
velocity of a particle. Besides, equation (13) is in-
variant with respect to Lorentz transformations
(5) if the weight function Ψ from the relation
′ = Ψψr satisﬁes the equation [i¯h(∂t + V ∂x) +
ψr
(c2¯h2(1− β2)/2E(1− V ·v/c2))[(∂x + β∂t/c)2/(1−
β2) + ∂yy + ∂zz]]Ψψr = 0, V = (V, 0, 0). The
weight functions corresponding to the solutions
(14) are Ψr

form, and will not be presented here. The so-
lutions (14) in the nonrelativistic approximation
take the form

where E = m0v2/2, E0 = m0c2, p = m0v; ψ1(x)
is the known solution; ψ2(x) is the new linear-
independent solution that reveals itself in ana-
lyzing the Lorentz invariance in the Schr¨odinger
equation. By comparing the results obtained
with the well-known results published, one can
conclude that the Galilei group is the symme-
try group in the sense of Lie for the Schr¨odinger
equation and the symmetry group in the gen-
eralized sense for the equations of D’Alembert
and Maxwell. Analogously, the Lorentz group is
the symmetry group in the sense of Lie for the
equations of D’Alembert and Maxwell and the
symmetry group in the generalized sense for the
Schr¨odinger equation [1].

5.FIVE-DIMENSIONAL SPACE WITH
NONINVARIANT VELOCITY OF LIGHT

Let us dwell on examples of the new symmetries as-
sociated with the change-over to the space of diﬀerent
dimensionality. We shall introduce 5-dimensional ab-
stract space of events V 5(t, x, c) in which the velocity
of light c plays the role of additional independent vari-
able. Next, we shall consider commutation relation-
ships of the generators gs of the conformal group C15
and the generators Xn = cn[c∂c − t∂t + N (t∂t + x · ∇)]
of the Virasoro inﬁnite algebra with the D’Alembert
operator in this space

[✷, gs] = 0, gs = {cN Pa, Mab};
−N Ka};
[✷, gp]φ = 0, gp = {D, c
[gs, gp] = Cspqgq;
[Xn, Xm] = (m − n)Xm+n;
[Xn, gs] = 0.

(16)

Here gs belong to a set of the operators cN Pa, Mab,
D, c−N Ka; N = 0, ±1, ±2 . . .; Cspq are the Lie al-
gebra structure constants of the conformal group;
|m|, |n| < ∞. According to the generalized deﬁnition
of symmetry, this algebra is the invariance algebra of
the D’Alembert equation and the Maxwell free equa-
tions of the type p = 1. The algebra may be brought
into correspondence with the coordinate transforma-
tions group with the noninvariant velocity of light.
In the particular case N = 0 these transformations
were considered by Romain (1963), the author of the
present work (1970), Di Jorio (1974), Sj¨odin (1979).

With c′ = c the formulae contain the Voigt transfor-
mations (1887), Ives (1937), Palacios-Gordon (1957,
1962), Dewan (1961), Podlaha (1969). With c′ = λc
(λ is the group parameter) they contain the transfor-
mations of the author of the present work (1970), Hsu
(1976) and Mamaev (1990) [1].

6.DISCRETE ”-C” SYMMETRY

We shall next turn to the new symmetry of discrete
type. As is known, the discreet symmetries play an
important role in modern physics, for example, in par-
ticle physics, quantum ﬁeld theory, nuclear physics.
One can note, as an example, the space inversion
P (x → −x), the time inversion T (t → −t), the
charge conjugation C. Let us introduce a new dis-
creet transformation - inversion of the velocity of light
Q : t → t, x → x, c → −c. The inversion Q is
closed into a group that forms a direct product with
the Lorentz group (it does not change the form of
the Lorentz transformations) and is the new trans-
formation of discrete symmetry for the equations of
classic and quantum electrodynamics: the equations
of D’Alembert and Maxwell, the equations for move-
ment of a charged particle in electromagnetic ﬁeld,
the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation, the Dirac equation
and the Schr¨odinger equations (13). The consequence
of −c symmetry of Dirac equation is the possibility
to interpret the charge conjugation C in terms of the
Q-conjugation [C, Q]Ψ(x) = 0, where Ψ(x) is the so-
lution of Eq. (7) [1].

7.INTERNAL SYMMETRY OF
MAXWELL EQUATIONS

Besides the space-time symmetries,
in physics ap-
plications also ﬁnd so named internal symmetries.
The internal symmetries are not connected with the
properties of space and time and characterize the
very objects to be studied. As applied to elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld, the investigation of such symme-
tries was started by Heaviside (1893), Rainich (1925)
and Larmor (1928).
It was then carried out by
Markhashov (1966), Danilov (1967) and Ibragimov
(1968) within the framework of the Lie classic algo-
rithm. Fushchich and Nikitin (1978) and then the
author (1982) of the present work continued these in-
vestigations with the help of the non-Lie algorithm
(proposed by Fushchich and Nikitin) on the base of
the Fourier transformations. We shall use the ele-
ments of this algorithm, start from the Maxwell ho-
mogeneous equations and introduce the Fourier trans-
E(x0, p)eip·xd3p,
formations E(x0, x) = (1/2π)3/2
H(x0, p)eip·xd3p for electric E
H(x0, x) = (1/2π)3/2
and magnetic H ﬁeld and turn to the Maxwell equa-
tions in the p-space

8.NONLINEAR MAXWELL EQUATIONS

ds2 = (c0

2 + v2)dt2 − dx2 − dy2 − dz2,

(19)

From the condition of invariance of these equations
with respect to the transformations of ﬁelds E →
E ′ and H → H′ we ﬁnd a set of the sixteen
6X6 matrices YLMN (p), ZLMN (p), p = (p1, p2, p3),
(L, M, N ) = 0, 1 transforming the equations (17)
into themselves. The matrices satisfy the permu-
tation relations of the Lie algebra, the Grassman
algebra and super algebra [Y, Y ] = Y ;
[Y, Z] =
Z; {Z, Z} = Y . Out of them the Lie 16-dimensional
algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the uni-
tary transformations group U (2)XU (2)XU (2)XU (2),
which contains the 8-dimensional group U (2)XU (2)
of Fushchich and Nikitin and the 2-dimensional group
U (1)XU (1) of Danilov and Ibragimov. The latter
includes the Larmor-Rainich transformations E′ =
′
Ecosθ +Hsinθ, H
= −E sin θ +Hcosθ (θ is the group
¯
parameter) and the discreet Heaviside transformations
E′ = H, H′ = −E at θ = π/2. All the transforma-
tions in the x-space, except for the Danilov-Ibragimov
transformations, are nonlocal (integral) [1].

In all the cases considered we dealt with linear equa-
tions. But in contemporary physics nonlinear equa-
tions has received wide acceptance as well. Nonlinear
equations are used, for example, in the catastrophe
theory, in the theory of control, in quantum theory.
They possess a number of such exclusive properties as
the absence of superposition principle, the existence
of nonlinear interaction of ﬁelds, the existence of soli-
ton solutions. The ﬁrst work on nonlinear equations
in electrodynamics was done by Mie in 1912 on the
base of introducing functions of ﬁeld invariants into
the theory. The concrete version of nonlinear equa-
tions was proposed by Born and then by Born and
Infeld (1934). The nonlinear electrodynamics equa-
tions in the present work

diﬀer from the Born-Infeld equations and are of self-
suﬃcient importance. (Here F is the arbitrary func-
tion of the Lorentz-invariants of the ﬁeld I1 = 2(E2 −
H2), I2 = (EH)2). With ρ = 0 they contain the
Maxwell free equations; with F (I1, I2) = 1 they go
into the Maxwell equations (4); the nonlinearity is
caused by the presence of currents and charges. The
equations realize the principle of self-action with the
result that the electric charge within the framework of
these equations partially has a ﬁeld nature. In view
of the relativistic invariance the equations are of po-
tential interest for physics [1].

9.APPLICATION TO PHYSICS

Next we shall turn to the question of physical in-
terpretation of the mathematical results, in particu-
lar, from Section 5. As an example we shall con-
sider the symmetry connected with violation of the
Special Relativity (SR) second postulate - postulate
of the invariance of the speed of light. The ques-
tions on the possibility of its violation and on the
existence of the faster-than-light motions invariably
attracts the scientiﬁc community’s attention. Abra-
ham (1908), Ritz (1908), Blokhintsev (1946), Kirzh-
nits (1954), Terletsky (1960), Rapier (1962), Fein-
berg (1967), Loiseau (1968), Bilaniuk and Sudarshan
(1969), the author of the present work (1970), Marinov
(1975), Hsu (1976), Recami (1982), Logunov (1982),
Chubykalo and Smirnov-Rueda (1996), Russo (1998),
Glashow (1999) and other authors investigated this
problem from diﬀerent points of view. Below we shall
consider the author’s work [2] which starts from the
invariance of 4-interval of space-time

where the invariant c0 = 3 · 1010 cm/sec is the proper
value of the velocity of light. As a result we may
introduce on the path of moving the particle some
universal time t = t0 like Newtonian time in classical
physics. Then the velocity of light c will depend on
the emitter velocity according to the law c = c0(1 +
2)1/2. The space-time transformations retaining
v2/c0
the invariance of the 4-interval ds2 take the form

(20)

where c′ = c(1 − V vx/c2)/(1 − V 2/c2)1/2, vx = x/t.
In the Minkowski space M 4(x0, x) they may be clas-
siﬁed as the transformations of space-time-velocity of
light which belong to the direct product of the Lorentz
group L6 and the group of the scale transformations
of the velocity of light ∆1(c) : c′ = λc (λ is the group
parameter). The corresponding integral of action, La-
grangian, expressions for 4-momentum and the energy
of a particle in electromagnetic ﬁeld are constructed.
In particular, the expressions for 3-momentum p and
energy E take the form

p = mv, E = mc0c = mc0

1 + v2/c0

2.

(21)

p

As a result the theory possesses a number of signs
common to both SR and classical physics. For ex-
ample, as in classic mechanics, the particle mass m
is independent of its velocity v. The particle en-
2(1 + mv2/2 + . . .) in v ≪ c0
ergy E = mcc0 = mc0
approximation coincides with the expression for ki-
netic energy in Newton mechanics with an accuracy

2p2 = m2c0

2 (as in SR). The momen-
of the rest energy E0 = mc0
tum p and the energy E are related by the relation-
ship coinciding formally with the relativistic expres-
sion E 2 − c0

consists in the fact that here the energy and the mo-
2)1/2 and p = mv,
2(1 + v2/c0
mentum are E = mc0
2)1/2 and
2/(1 − v2/c0
respectively, but not E = mc0
p = mv/(1 − v2/c0

sical electrodynamics (4) with c = c0.

In v2/c0

Many experiments hitherto interpreted in terms of
SR, may be explained within the framework of the
constructed theory. For example, the experiments of
Michelson and Fizeau, the aberration of light, the ap-
pearance of atmospheric µ-mesons near the Earth’s
surface, the Doppler-eﬀect, a number of the well-
known experiments to prove independence of the ve-
locity of light from the velocity of light source, the
decay of unstable particles, the generation of new
particles from nuclear reactions, the Compton-eﬀect,
photo-eﬀect. Let us consider some of them.

The negative result of the Michelson experiment for
an observer with a terrestrial source of light (the speed
of light c0) may be explained by the isotropy of space.
Since the speed of light c0 is the same in all direc-
tions, a shift of the interference pattern should be ab-
sent with the interferometer’s rotation. Analogously,
in the case of an extraterrestrial source (the star mov-
ing inertialy with a velocity v relatively to the Earth),
the velocity of light from the star c = c0(1+v2/c0
2)1/2
does not depend on the direction of its propagation
and is thus the same for an observer on the Earth. As
a result, the interference pattern does not change with
the interferometer’s rotation.

A free particle with the mass m will move faster
than light at the velocity v = c0[(E/E0)2 − 1]1/2 >
c0 if the particle energy satisﬁes the inequality E >
21/2E0, where E0 = mc0
2 is the particle rest energy.
As an illustration, for the electron faster-than-light
motion begins with the energy E ∼ 723 keV. The 1
MeV-electron velocity is ∼ 1.68c0; the 1 GeV-electron
velocity is ∼ 2000c0.

The angle of aberration of the quasar Q1158+4635
with the parameter of red shift zλ = 4.73 (Carswell
and Hewett, 1990) is α ∼ 11.6 arc seconds; zω ∼ 2.23,
the velocity of light is c = c0(1 + zλ)/(1 + zω) ∼ 1.77c0

instead of α ∼ 20.5 arc seconds and zλ = zω, c = c0
in SR.

The velocity of atmospheric µ-mesons at

the
Earth’s surface is ∼ 100c0, the energy is ∼ 10.6 GeV.
Independence of the velocity of light from the veloc-
ity of a source of light was considered in rather nu-
merous experiments. As an example, we turn to the
Filippas and Fox experiment (1964) in which the ve-
locities of γ-quanta from the decay π0 → γ + γ of fast
π0-mesons were compared. Because of independence
of the velocity c = c0(1+v2/c0
2)1/2 from the direction
of the γ-emission, the velocities of γ-quanta, as in SR,
should be the same. It means a negative result, in the
standard sense, of this experiment and other experi-
ments of such a type (Bonch-Bruevich and Molchanov
1956, Sadeh 1963).

The velocity of Compton forward - scattered elec-
tron v = c0(¯hω/E0)[1 − E0/(2¯hω + E0)] exceeds the
speed of light c0 if the energy of an incident gamma
quantum ¯hω is more than 698 keV. The angular dis-
tribution of scattered gamma quanta coincides with
the one obtained from SR.

The velocity of photoelectron v = c0[((¯hω + mec0

2 −
2)2 − 1]1/2 exceeds the speed of light c0 if the
U )/mec0
photon energy satisﬁes the inequality ¯hω > 211 keV
2 is the
+ U , where U is the ionization energy, mec0
electron rest energy.

In sum, the L6X∆1(c)-invariant theory has been
constructed. The faster-than-light motions are possi-
ble in this theory. According to the construction, the
proposed theory is close to the SR theory and based
(as SR) on the principles of a symmetry approach. It
has been found that this theory permits one to in-
terpret a set of the well-known experiments. In the
case of the Michelson and Fizeau experiments the re-
sults of the interpretation coincide with the accepted
results. On the other hand, there is a number of the
predictions which diﬀer from SR predictions. These
are, for example, faster-than-light motions of nuclear
reactions products, faster-than-light motions in astro-
physics. These predictions may be the subject of ex-
perimental investigation. The postulation c′ = c leads
to SR.

Abstract

Sound consonance is the reason why it is possible to exist music in our

life. However, rules of consonance between sounds had been found quite

subjectively, just by hearing. To care for, the proposal is to establish a sound

consonance law on the basis of mathematical and physical foundations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Sound consonance is one of the main reason why it is possible to exist music in our life.

However, rules of sound consonance had been found quite subjectively, just by hearing [2].

It sounds good, after all music is art! But physics challenge is to discover laws wherever

they are [1]. To care for, it is proposed, here, a sound consonance law on the basis of

mathematical and physical foundations.

As we know, Occidental musics are based in the so called Just Intonation Scale, built

with a set of musical notes which frequencies are related between them in the interval

of frequencies from some f0 to f1 = 2f0 that deﬁnes the octave. Human audible sound

frequencies comprehend from about 20Hz to 20, 000Hz, and a typical piano keyboard covers

7 octaves from notes C1 to C8, with the standard tuning up frequency attributed to the note

1

A4 for 440.00Hz.

[3]

The origin of actual musical scale remits us to the Greek mathematician Pythagoras.

Using a monochord, a vibrating string with a movable bridge that transforms into a two

vibrating strings with diﬀerent but related lengths and frequencies, he found that combina-

tions of two sounds with frequency relations 2 : 1, 3 : 2 and 4 : 3 are particularly pleasant,

while many other arbitrary combinations are unpleasant. Two sounds getting a pleasant

combined sound are called consonant, in the other case they are dissonant. This set of

relations encompassed into the frequencies interval of one octave deﬁnes the Pythagorean

Scale, which is shown in Table 1, with notes and frequency relations of each note compared

to the ﬁrst one, Ci. Table 2 shows the frequency relations of the two adjacent notes, with a

whole tone given by 9/8 and a semitone given by 256/243.

Consonance and dissonance are not absolute concepts, and the Greek astronomer

Ptolomy added to the Pythagorean consonant relations 3 : 2 : 1 another set of relations

who considered as well as consonant, 4 : 5 : 6. This enlarged set is the base of the so called

Just Intonation Scale, which is shown in table 3, with notes and frequency relations of each

note compared to the ﬁrst one, Ci. Table 4 shows the frequency relations of the two adjacent

notes, with a major whole tone given by 9/8, the minor whole tone given by 10/9 and a

Actually, in terms of the consonant frequency relations, the Just Intonation Scale is richer

than the Pythagorean Scale. It can be understood why it is just so after the law of sound

consonance we are going to establish.

II. THE CONSONANCE LAW OF SOUND WAVES

For the purpose to establish the law of sound consonance, the essential thing is to know

how two sound waves with diﬀerent frequencies, f1 and f2, combine when produced simul-

taneously. It is suﬃcient to examine only the time oscillation, given by the trigonometric

relation [4]

(f1 + f2)

which shows a main wave with mean frequency

modulated by the beat frequency

Without loss of generality, we are going to suppose f2 > f1.

We can see that, if

f =

(f2 −

for integers n > 1, the resulting wave is, yet, a regular and periodic wave, behaving like

a sound wave composed with harmonic sound components, as it is in fact. It can be seen

inverting the trigonometric relation (1) above using the frequency relation (5), which leads

It is easy to verify that the frequency relations as 3 : 2 : 1 and 4 : 5 : 6 satisfy, all of than,

the condition (4) or (5). For example, in the Pythagorean frequency relations, we have

In Pythagorean Scale, in the table 1 there are 4 consonant relations (9/8, 4/3, 3/2 and

2) and in the table 2 there are 5 consonant relations 9/8. In the Just Intonation Scale, in

the table 3 there are 6 consonant relations (9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 2) and in the table 4 all

of the 7 frequency relations are consonant. It is the reason why the Just Intonation Scale is

better than the Pythagorean Scale.

Sound sources are vibrating systems, and produce sounds that are combinations of a

fundamental and its harmonics, with a particular combination deﬁning the timbre of the

sound. So, to the consonance condition being consistent, frequency relations like (4) must

be valid simultaneously to all, the fundamental and its harmonic frequencies. Fortunately,

it is so, as we can see easily. Really, taking the compositions of all oscillating modes of the

two sound sources with fundamental frequencies f1and f2,

and

u1(t) =

Ak cos 2πkf1t

u2(t) =

Ak cos 2πkf2t ,

respectively, the combination of these two composed sounds becomes

u(t) =

which is a harmonic series. Again, it is all we need to have a harmonious or consonant

Now, we are ready to state the Consonance Law of Sound Waves: two sound waves with

fundamental frequencies f1and f2, with f1 < f2, are consonant if these frequencies satisfy

there is no exact frequency relation (14), but it is closely approximated, in a compromise to

favor the practical. The scale of equal temperament is widely used as an universal tuning

up of mostly popular musical instruments, with a few exceptions as the violin or the singing

natural human voice.

III. CONCLUSIONS

An exact mathematical frequency relation is presented to deﬁne a consonance law of

sound waves. It is used to show that it is veriﬁed in the frequency relations of consonant

notes used to built the musical scales.

Comment on the Riemann Hypothesis

Abstract

The Riemann hypothesis is identiﬁed with zeros of

= 4 supersymmetric gauge
theory four-point amplitude. The zeros of the ζ(s) function are identiﬁed with th
complex dimension of the spacetime, or the dimension of the toroidal compactiﬁcation.
A sequence of dimensions are identiﬁed in order to map the zeros of the amplitude to
the Riemann hypothesis.

amplitudes vanish when the zeta function has zeros on the real axis s = 1/2 + it.
(The Riemann zeta function on this axis has some similarities with the vanishing of
the partition function of certain condensed matter theories as a function of couplings,
i.e. Lee-Yang zeros.)

The full amplitudes of

= 4 theory may be constructed either in a gauge
coupling perturbative series, i.e. the usual diagrammatic expansion formulated via
unitarity methods, or as an expansion in derivatives, with the latter approach being
nonperturbative in coupling. Both expansions are equivalent, found from a diagram
by diagram basis.

gauge vertices are only required (the coeﬃcients of course are found via the sewing,
involving the integrations [2], [4]-[7]).

We shall not review in detail the sewing relations that allow for a determination
of the coeﬃcients of the modular functions at the various derivative orders. This is
discussed in detail in [4]-[7].

3 Rescaling of coupling

A rescaling of the coupling constant via g

g1+ǫ changes the expansion in (2.9) to,

(g2)2+ǫ(g2)(nmax/2)(1+ǫ)[(g2)(nmax/2)(1+ǫ), . . . , (g2)(−nmax/2+1)(1+ǫ)] .

(3.1)

The rescaling of the couplings into the metric and the gauge ﬁelds would naively
generate a derivative expansion with modular functions labeled by Es(1+ǫ), and hence
diﬀerent coeﬃcients for the expansion. These terms can always be supersymmetrized
to obtain the remaining couplings involving the fermions and scalars. Within the
loop expansion the zeta function takes values in accord with the dimension of the
loop integrals, which suggests that the theory is in a diﬀerent dimension from 4 to
4(1 + ǫ/2); comparison with the loop expansion is required to determine this (note

that the tree-level terms found from the ﬁrst term in (2.9) are invariant after including
the gauge ﬁeld rescaling; this is true for the scatteing after changing dimension).

−

Note that for ǫ =

1 the entire scattering has no coupling dependence; gauge
theory in d = 2 is topological, and the gauge ﬁeld and coupling may be gauged away
in a background without topology. The self-consistency via the sewing knocks out
the coeﬃcients of the covariant gauge ﬁeld operators and one is left with the scalar
interactions; the fermionic terms vanish as they only couple to the gauge ﬁeld. The
4)/2) =
dimension changes as 4(1 + ǫ/2), or rather to a dimension of 4(1 + (d

1 + d/2) =

4 + 2d.

4 Amplitudes and zeros of the Riemann function

The arguments of the Riemann zeta function for a given derivative term of the gauge
theory scattering amplitude are 2s and 2s

of the zeta function are

−

2(

2 + d)(n + 2)

2(

2 + d)(n + 2)

4(n + 2)

+ 2 ,

dR =

4(n + 2)

(4.2)

are identiﬁed then the arguments of the zeta functions are on the real s = 1/2 axis.
These series have d = 2 as a limit point, with a maximum dimension of 2+1/8 = 2.125.
The gauge sector vanishes for d = 2, i.e. at the limit point.

If the amplitudes vanished via the identiﬁcation on the s = 1/m axis, then the

real part of the dimension would be

dR =

1
2m(n + 2)

+ 2 ,

dR =

3
2m(n + 2)

+ 2 .

(4.3)

Example dimensions pertaining to the Riemann hypothesis, m = 2 in (4.3), are

dR = 2 + 1/12 = 25/12,

2 + 1/16 = 33/16,

2 + 1/20 = 41/20 ,

(4.4)

dR = 2 + 1/4 = 9/4,

2 + 3/16 = 35/16, 2 + 3/20 = 43/20 .

(4.5)

The identiﬁcation can be thought of as toroidal compactiﬁcation with the dimensions
identiﬁed, or as a series of identiﬁed four-manifolds.

5 Discussion

= 4 supersymmetric gauge theory amplitudes, including the nonperturbative cor-
N
rections, are examined as a function of complex dimension. The zeros of the Riemann
zeta function enforce the vanishing of the four-point gauge theory amplitudes. More
precisely, the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the vanishing of the amplitudes of
= 4 four-point functions when the theory is dimensionally reduced on identiﬁed

N
tori of dimension d, with d = idI + dR,

dR =

1
2m(n + 2)

+ 2

and

dR =

3
2m(n + 2)

+ 2 .

(5.1)

The real parts of these dimensions range from 2 to 2.125, with d = 2 (dI = 0) special
from the point of the triviality of the gauge ﬁeld (pure gauge).

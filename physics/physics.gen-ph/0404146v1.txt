Abstract

We use notions and techniques of Quantum Field Theory to for-
mulate and investigate basic concepts and mechanisms of human com-
munication. We start with attitudes which correspond to photons fre-
quencies, then we introduce states-of-mind which correspond to wave
functions. Finally, by way of the second quantization, we come to
states-of-opinions which correspond to states of quantized radiation
ﬁelds. In the present paper we shall only investigate superpositions of
pairs of coherent states (e.g. the government and the opposition in a
democratic country).

1 Introduction

Suppose we want to investigate the social behavior of a human community
relative to a chosen subject. We expose the subject by producing a question-
naire with entries containing descriptions of the components of the subject
in question. The questionnaire can be completed in several ways which we
shall call attitudes. However, the process of ﬁlling in a questionnaire in a
speciﬁc way is not a deterministic procedure. Usually, the mind of a respon-
dent faces a number of preferences. Under casual inﬂuence from outside the
preferences can change. Hence, the reaction of a respondent is not attached
to a particular attitude but depends on the respondent’s state-of-mind.

A statement of a respondent selecting an attitude or a state-of-mind shall

here be called a bit-of-information.

Fix a ﬁnite set of frequences and consider photons with frequences from
this set. Hence the momentum space for these photons consists of ﬁnitely
many points and their wave-functions are superpositions of the frequencies.
We create our social model by way of the following substitutions,

1) bits-of-information replace photons
2) attitudes replace frequencies
3) states-of-mind replace wave-functions.
As we know, the instance of passing from frequencies to wave-functions,
and hence from attitudes to states-of-mind, constitutes the essence of the
ﬁrst quantization.

Totalities of states-of-mind produce new entities called opinions. Then
states-of-opinion emerge as the result of the process of the second quanti-
zation which mathematically amounts to the repetition of the one used in
constructing a free quantum radiation ﬁeld (cf.[1], [2]). Hence
4) states-of-opinion replace quantized radiation ﬁelds.
To describe the second quantization we use the algebraic version of the
In [5]

concept of the Bose-Fock space, the so-called Bose algebra (cf.[4]).
states-of-opinion were called information metabolisms.

The observables of the theory are just questions. Given a question and a
state-of-opinion, the occupation number formalism provides the expectation

2

of the number of positive answers to the question in a poll performed under
the given state-of-opinion (cf. [6]).

We treat bits-of-information circulating in human communities as bosons.
The propagators of those bits-of-information are the individual respondents
which, depending on their states-of-mind, provide answers yes or no to ques-
tions. Also organizations can get the status of respondents and quality of
possessing a state-of-mind. Questions are coupled with orthogonal projec-
tions in the space of states-of-mind. Aﬃrmative answers are weighted by the
assigned number of energy-bits they carry: electing a Member of Parliament
requires many energy-bits in the form of single votes whereas a shareholder’s
single vote carries the number of energy-bits equal to the number of owned
shares.

In what follows we shall mainly be interested in superpositions of co-
herent states-of-opinion. The coherent states considered in this paper are
mathematically identical with those of quantum optics. They are deﬁned
within the polynomial representation of the Bose-Fock space (cf.[4]). In the
present paper we restrict ourselves to analysis of states which are superpo-
sitions of two coherent states, e.g. the government and the opposition in a
democratic country, the original inhabitants of a country and the immigrants,
Christians and Moslems etc. Such states will be called bicoherent. We shall
show that the bicoherent states depend on two parameters. The ﬁrst, the
interaction coeﬃcient, is a number between 0 and 1 measuring the back-
ground for communication between respondents of interacting fractions: a
common language, traditions, religion, interest etc. The second one is called
the superposition constant.

In a simple model constructed in Section 5, the superposition constant
plays a double role - if it is greater or equal to one, it prevents interaction
blocking the inﬂuence of the interaction coeﬃcient. If negative, it controls
regions of high and low frequencies of aﬃrmation to questions asked in the
superposition state-of-opinion. Moreover, under high interaction a sudden
critical switch of opinion can occur in consequence of a minimal change of
the superposition constant (cf. Remark 7). We also investigate change of
opinion under temporary inﬂuence of some outside factors (as for instance
election campaigns). It is shown that such a temporary inﬂuence diminishes
high amplitudes (cf. Remark 8).

The authors are much indebted to Krista Graversen for her help in edit-
ing this paper. Also the ﬁrst of the authors wishes to express his gratitude
for the hospitality of the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences at
UCI. Discussions with members of the Institute considerably inﬂuenced the
form of this paper. David Bulger pointed out some inaccuracies in our pre-
sentation of the Bargmann Fock-space representation. We are grateful for

3

his contribution.

2 The ﬁrst quantization

2.1 Proﬁles

A selected sub-population characterized by a collection of attitudes will here
be called a proﬁle. For example the body of parliament members of a demo-
cratic country constitutes a proﬁle. The attitudes will represent diﬀerent
political aﬃliations. The states-of-mind will then concern actual political
problems. Also the government and its members can be considered as a pro-
ﬁle. Here the set of attitudes will include diﬀerent policies. For the proﬁle
of workers, the relevant attitudes will be concerned with the unions.

Hence, the same physical population consists of several diﬀerent proﬁles.
Proﬁles connected with a profession is easiest revealed by asking a question
to which the answer ”yes” selects the states-of-mind of the profession. For
example, the question ”do you have a valid certiﬁcate qualifying you as a
physician?” automatically extracts the proﬁle of medical doctors. An exam-
ination will ﬁlter respondents of the proﬁle of a particular profession. The
whole population itself constitutes a proﬁle as well.

2.2 Attitudes

Consider a community familiar with subjects which can be presented in a
list of statements. The statements can be accepted or rejected by members
of the community. In what follows we refer to this list of statements as a
questionnaire. The term ”questionnaire” should not be taken literally. For
instance, a questionnaire may consist of a set of examination questions but
it can as well be an ordinary questionnaire prepared for a poll.

A copy of a completed questionnaire shall be called an attitude. The
quantum mechanical counterpart of an attitude is a frequency. Hence the
quantum mechanical equivalence of a space of attitudes is a momentum space
consisting of ﬁnitely many frequencies.

2.3 The ﬁrst quantization: from attitudes to states-of-

mind

where λ1, λ2, ..., λk are arbitrary real numbers. Given another vector from

2.4 Questions as observables

The process of assigning an attitude j to a respondent can be ”ﬁrst quan-
tized” to a question directed to a respondent, ”are you fully accepting the
attitude j? ” The question itself then becomes an observable taking the
form of the projection

h
Now the procedure can be extended over arbitrary states-of-mind by attach-
ing to a state-of-mind x the projection

·i

Qej =

ej,

which directed to a respondent runs as follows

Qx =

”are you in the state-of-mind x ?”

We attach statistics to this question by way of the statement

the probability of obtaining the
answer ”yes” to the question Qx
from a respondent in state y



i.e. the probability of the answer ”yes” is equal to the correlation of x and
y.



More general questions Q are linear combinations of questions of the form

Qx. Then

Qy, y

=

h

the probability of obtaining the
answer ”yes” to the question Q
from a respondent in state y

.



As an example we consider the projection

Qx =

ei +

ej, x

where i and j are diﬀerent attitudes. The question corresponding to this
projection should read ”do you favor precisely the attitudes i and j out of
the collection of all possible attitudes? ” Here we have Qx = x, exactly for
ej which means that the answer ”yes” comes with
x =
probability one from the states x = λei + ηej, with λ2 + η2 = 1.

As explained in the Introduction, each aﬃrmative answer to a question
carries a number of energy-bits depending on the nature of the corresponding
model.

3 The second quantization

The notions of attitude and state-of-mind concern individual respondents.
The second quantization provides a formalism by use of which the parallel
notions on the level of proﬁles can be deﬁned (cf.[1], [4]). The counterpart
of the notion of attitude attached to an individual member of a community
will be the notion of opinion attached to a group of individuals. Similarly
the counterpart of the notion of state-of-mind attached to a respondent will
be the notion of state-of-opinion attached to a proﬁle (which can as well
be the whole community). As a state-of-mind assigns a number to every
possible attitude, a state-of-opinion will assign a number to every possible
opinion of a proﬁle, i.e. the states-of-opinion are functions over the space of
opinions. Given such a function, the square of its value on an opinion gives
the probability that the proﬁle shares this opinion.

3.1 Opinions and the Bose-Fock space for states-of-

opinion

Suppose that from a poll we have gathered information about the actual
distribution of attitudes of a proﬁle. It means that we have a collection of
attitudes, where the same attitude may appear many times, a single time or
not at all. To obtain the precise deﬁnition we proceed as follows.

{

Let

1, 2, ..., n
}

be the set of all attitudes. Then a tuple of positive integers
(k1, k2, ..., kn) shall be called an opinion in which the attitude j appears kj
times for j = 1, 2, ..., n. If a particular attitude, say i, does not appear at all,
we write ki = 0. A poll assigns to each attitude the number of respondents
sharing this attitude i.e. it provides the opinion of the community. We use
the (real) Bargmann version of the Bose-Fock space construction. Write
for the algebra of all formal series

and the sum runs through all the tuples (k1, k2, ..., kn) of non-negative inte-
gers.

We multiply the series in the standard way setting

ej1,j2,...,jnek1,k2,...,kn = ej1+k1,j2+k2,...,jn+kn,.

We postulate that a proﬁle which consists of k1 members carrying the state-
of-mind e1, k2 members carrying the state-of-mind e2 etc. up to kn members
carrying the state-of-mind en, is in the state-of-opinion ek1,k2,...,kn

It is easy to extend Q(k) to an orthogonal projection in Γ
. The projection
Q(k) is an observable in the space of states-of-opinion and corresponds to the
question:

F

Is there exactly k answers ”yes” to the question Q?

Consequently, for a state-of-opinion f we have

Q(k)f, f

we get precisely k answers ”yes” to Q

This operation is often called the second quantization of Q. It is easy to verify
that the spectral decomposition of dΓQ is

dΓQ = Σ∞k=0kQ(k).

3.3 Coherent states

A coherent state-of-opinion describes respondents with states-of-mind con-
centrated around a special state-of-mind called the mode of coherence, e.g.
physicians with their professional curriculum as the mode, members of a
political party with their party program as the mode, lawyers with their
professional know-how as the mode etc.

which is the state-of-mind that provides the right frequencies of occurrence
of the attitudes from a ﬁxed list. The mode for a given coherent state can
be approximated as follows. We produce a ”super-questionnaire” out of all
involved attitudes; then count the frequencies of the choice of particular at-
titudes in a poll and take their square roots as coeﬃcients to the respective
attitude.

We can easily compute the relative expectation

for Q in a coherent

state c (x) . Since dΓQ is a derivation, we have

4 Bicoherence

The concept of bicoherence concerns a community consisting of two coherent
fractions, e.g. the government and the opposition in a democratic country,
members of two diﬀerent religious aﬃliations, a population consisting of na-
tives and immigrants etc. In each of these cases the state-of-opinion of the
whole population is a superposition of the states-of-opinion of two coher-
ent sub-proﬁles. The state-of-opinion of the superposition is not any longer
coherent and shall be called bicoherent.

One can easily quote important cases involving more than two coherent
states but already in the case of three, the amount of necessary computation
will double the size of this paper and hence must be postponed to a separate
publication.

4.1 Bicoherent states

ϑ (λ, ω)

,

where

ϑ (λ, ω) =

c (u) + λc (v)

|

shall be called bicoherent states. For λ

= 0 we have

|

λ

cλ (u, v) = c 1

(v, u)

so that for λ close to inﬁnity, cλ (u, v) behaves exactly as cλ (v, u) behaves for
λ close to zero. The coeﬃcient λ will be called the superposition constant.

The closer to zero is ω, i.e. the greater is

, the more the states
c (u) and c (v) act as uncorrelated, and cλ (u, v) describes a proﬁle split into
two groups which hardly communicate with each other.

The interaction coeﬃcient measures the ability for interaction (as for
instance speaking the same everyday language, being a citizen of a democratic
country, having the same cultural or religious background etc.).

−

The superposition constant plays two diﬀerent roles.

It measures the
degrees of inﬂuence the participating coherent states have on their super-
position. And it marks the existence of wish to enter the interaction at all:
Catholics and Protestants of Northern Ireland are fully capable of interacting
on an arbitrarily high social level but they will not enter the interaction due
to some special reasons.

Suppose that some social forces alter the coherent state c (x) to another
coherent state c (y) . Then, writing z = y
x, we can consider z as the
vector altering the generating vector x of the given coherent state to a new
generating vector x + z of the new coherent state c (x + z) = c (y) . This
reduces the process of changing c (x) into c (y) to the application of the
transformation Wz dependent on a vector z from

. The transformation

−

Wzc (x) = c (x + z)

F

of c (x) into c (x + z) is called the Weyl transformation. Given z, the Weyl
transformation Wz is uniquely extendable to a linear isometry (states-of-mind
preserving transformation) of Γ
onto itself (cf. [4]). The Weyl transforma-
tion Wz is fully described by the coherent state c (z) which shall be called
the generator of Wz.

The term ι (Q, u, v, z) measures the balance of the inﬂuence of c (z) on
components c (u) and c (v) of cλ (u, v) . If the inﬂuence of c (z) on cλ (u, v) is
equally distributed between c (u) and c (v), the term ι (Q, u, v, z) vanishes.

tary coherent proﬁles manifest. Fix two positive numbers a and b, a2 +b2 = 1

Suppose further that the community we investigate is polarized into two
proﬁles - one in the state c (u) and the other in the state c (v) . Let 100a2% of

Let us look at the diagrams above. For λ > 1 there are no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the forms of the diagrams. In all cases maximum is not attained
for λ = 0 but only for a negative λ. Movement of λ from zero in the negative
direction makes

Rω increase. Consequently we have

Conclusion 6 The increase of the inﬂuence of c (v) acts as a buster for c (u)
providing more aﬃrmative answers.

Say the interaction coeﬃcient ω is close to one. Starting at λ = 0 and
moving in the negative direction, we observe a rapid increase of
Rω. Then,
continuing to move λ in the same direction, the situation reverses - now the
maximum decreases towards the minimum.

Conclusion 7 The closer to one is the interaction coeﬃcient, the shorter is
the interval within which Rω attains ﬁrst the maximum and then the mini-
mum.

Then the situation stabilizes and with further decrease of λ,

to its limit

(Q, c (v)) in

so that the role of c (u) is eliminated.

As an example we can take the government and the opposition of a
democratic country each in a coherent state. Assume that there is an in-
tensive interaction between c (u) and c (v). Say the government has major-
(Q, c (v)) . A small negative weight λ attached to c (v)
ity:
yields not much contribution itself but by way of the interaction it provokes
(Q, c (v)) , then the
the other fraction to vote. Similarly if
increase of negative answers is provoked. Still higher negative weight yields
the reversed status - the respondents from c (v) take over and in the ﬁrst case
cause a decrease and in the second case an increase of aﬃrmation. These un-
usual variations can happen only in the presence of high interaction and in
small intervals of negative λ and hence will seldom occur in real life. How-
ever, such jumps in the distribution of votes have been observed in the past
(cf.[3]).

It is clearly visible that equally distributed inﬂuence of Wz makes the

extreme values of

Rω diminish.

Conclusion 8 The inﬂuence of Wz tempers the voters’ reactions.

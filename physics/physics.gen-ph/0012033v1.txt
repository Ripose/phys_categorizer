Abstract
It is hypothetized that the algebra of the conﬁguration of twenty-seven lines lying on a
general cubic surface underlines the dimensional hierarchy of heterotic string spacetimes.

1. Introduction
The correct quantitative elucidation and deep qualitative understanding of the observed
dimensionality and signature of the Universe represent, undoubtedly, a crucial stepping
stone on our path towards unlocking the ultimate secrets of the very essence of our being.
Although there have been numerous attempts of a various degree of mathematical rigoros-
ity and a wide range of physical scrutiny to address this issue, the subject still remains
one of the toughest and most challenging problems faced by contemporary physics. In
this contribution, we shall approach the problem by raising a somewhat daring hypothesis
that the dimensional aspect of the structure of spacetime may well be reproduced by the
algebra of a geometric conﬁguration as simple as that of the lines situated on a cubic
surface in a three-dimensional projective space.

2. The Set of Twenty-Seven Lines on a Cubic Surface
It is a well-known fact that on a generic cubic surface, K3, there is a conﬁguration of
twenty-seven lines /1/. Although this conﬁguration is geometrically perfectly symmetric
as it stands, it exhibits a remarkable non-trival structure when intersection/incidence re-
lations between the individual lines are taken into account. Namely, the lines are seen to
form three separate groups. The ﬁrst two groups, each comprising six lines, are known as
Schlaﬂi’s double-six. This is indeed a remarkable subset because the lines in either group
are not incident with each other, i.e. they are mutually skew, whereas a given line from
one group is skew with one and incident with the remaining ﬁve lines of the other group.
The third group consists of ﬁfteen lines, each one being incident with four lines of the
Schlaﬂi set and six other lines of the group in question. The basics of the algebra can
simply be expressed as:

27 = 12 + 15 = 2 × 6 + 15.

There exists a particularly illustrative representation of this algebra. The representa-
tion is furnished by a birational mapping between the points of K3 and the points of a
projective plane, P2 /1/. Under such a mapping, the totality of the planar sections of K3
has its counterpart in a linear, triply-inﬁnite aggregate (the so-called web) of cubic curves

in P2. Each cubic of the aggregate passes via six, generally distinct points Bi (i=1,2,. . . ,6);
the latter are called the base points of the web. And the twenty-seven lines of K3 are
projected on P2 as follows. The six lines L(+)
(the ﬁrst group of Schlaﬂi’s double-six)
are sent into (the neighbourhood of) the points Bi. Other six lines L(−)
(j=1,2,. . . ,6;
the second Schlaﬂi’s group) answer to the six conics Qj(B1,B2,. . . ,Bj−1,Bj+1,. . . ,B6), each
passing via ﬁve of the base points. Finally, the remaining ﬁfteen lines of the third group
have their images in ﬁfteen lines Lij, joining the pairs of base points BiBj, i 6= j.

3. An Algebra-Underlined Heterotic String Spacetime
Now, let us hypothetise that the dimensional hierarchy of the Universe is underlined by
the above-discussed simple algebra, indentifying formally each line of K3 with a single
dimension of a heterotic string spacetime. The total dimensionality of the latter would
then be 27 instead of 26 /2/. Further, we stipulate that the group of ﬁfteen lines answers
to the ﬁrst set of compactiﬁed dimensions of heterotic strings. We are thus left with
DS=12 dimensions corresponding to Schlaﬂi’s double-six, and surmise that this “Schlaﬂi”
spacetime is a natural setting for the M-theory, or, in fact, for the F-theory /3/; because
our algebra also implies that 12 = 2 × 6 = 2 × (5 + 1) = 10 + 2!

And what about the four macroscopic dimensions familiar to our senses? A hint for
their elucidation may lie in the following observation. As explicitly pointed out, each line
in the third group is incident with just four lines of the double-six. Let us assume that
one of the ﬁfteen lines in this group has a special standing among the others; then also
the corresponding four Schlaﬂi’s lines have a distinguished footing when compared with
the rest in their group, and the same applies to the four dimensions they correspond to. . .
To conclude, it is worth mentioning that our hypothesis gets a signiﬁcant support from
a recent ﬁnding by El Naschie /4/, based on the so-called Cantorian fractal-space ap-
proach, that the exact Hausdorﬀ dimension of heterotic string spacetimes is 26.18033989,
i.e. greater than 26.

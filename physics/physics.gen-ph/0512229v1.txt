Abstract

We compare and contrast two theories which both start in one di-
mension at the Planck scale, viz., Quantum SuperString or M-Theory
and a theory of Planck oscillations.

1 Introduction

String Theory has evolved into M-Theory over the decades and is receiving
a considerable amount of attention these days. Less well known is a theory
based on oscillators at the Planck scale which has lead to a number of very
interesting results. In both cases we start with one dimensional phenomena
at the Planck scale, vibrations in the case of strings and oscillators in the
latter case. But from this point on the theories take diﬀerent routes. In what
follows we will brieﬂy study, compare and contrast these approaches.

2 String Theory

Inspite of great success, the standard theory has failed to quantize gravita-
tion. One of the obstacles has been the point spacetime concept ingrained in
these theories. For the past few decades Quantum Gravity schemes as also
string theory have attempted to break out of this limitation. Let us ﬁrst
consider string theory.
We begin with the important work of T. Regge in the ﬁfties [1, 2, 3], in which
he mathematically analysed using techniques like analytically continuing the

1

angular momentum into the complex plane, particle resonances. These res-
onances seem to fall along a straight line plot, with the angular momentum
being proportional to the square of the mass.

M 2,

(1)

All this suggested that resonances had angular momentum, on the one hand
and resembled extended objects, that is particles smeared out in space. For
example, mathematically this was like two heavy objects attached to the two
ends of a string, or a rotating stick.
This went contrary to the belief that truly elementary particles were points
in space.
Infact at the turn of the twentieth century, Poincare, Lorentz,
Abraham and others had toyed with the idea that the electron had a ﬁnite
extension, but they had to abandon this approach, because of a conﬂict with
Special Relativity. The problem is that if there is a ﬁnite extension for the
electron then forces on diﬀerent parts of the electron would exhibit a time
lag, requiring the so called Poincare stresses for stability [4, 5, 6].
In this context, it may be mentioned that in the early 1960s, Dirac came up
with an imaginative picture of the electron, not so much as a point particle,
but rather a tiny closed membrane or bubble. Further, the higher energy
level oscillations of this membrane would represent the “heavier electrons”
like muons [7].
Then, in 1968, G. Veneziano came up with a uniﬁed description of the Regge
resonances (1) and other scattering processes. Veneziano considered the col-
lision and scattering process as a black box and pointed out that there were
in essence, two scattering channels, s and t channels. These, he argued gave
a dual description of the same process [8, 9].
In an s channel, particles A and B collide, form a resonance which quickly
disintegrates into particles C and D. On the other hand we have in a t chan-
nel scattering particles A and B approach each other, and interact via the
exchange of a particle q. The result of the interaction is that particles C and
D emerge. If we now enclose the resonance and the exchange particle q in an
imaginary black box, it will be seen that the s and t channels describe the
same input and the same output: They are essentially the same.
There is another interesting hint which we get from Quantum Chromo Dy-
namics. Let us come to the inter-quark potential [10, 11]. There are two
interesting features of this potential. The ﬁrst is that of conﬁnement, which

2

is given by a potential term like

V (r)

σr,

r

≈

,

→ ∞

where σ is a constant. This describes the large distance behavior between two
quarks. The conﬁning potential ensures that quarks do not break out of their
bound state, which means that eﬀectively free quarks cannot be observed.
The second interesting feature is asymptotic freedom. This is realized by a
Coulumbic potential

Vc(r)

∝

(r)

where

(r)

The constant σ is called the string tension, because there are string models
which yield V (r). This is because, at large distances the inter-quark ﬁeld is
string like with the energy content per unit length becoming constant. Use
of the angular momentum - mass relation indicates that σ
Such considerations lead to strings which are governed by the equation [12,

The string eﬀectively shows up as an inﬁnite collection of harmonic oscilla-
tors [13]. It must be mentioned that (6) and (3) to (5) both show that l is

of the order of the Compton wavelength. This has been called one of the
miracles of string theory by Veneziano [16]. In fact the minimum length l
turns out to be given by T /¯h2 = c/l2, which from (4) and (5) is seen to give
the Compton wavelength.
This is a description of what may be called a “Bosonic String”. These theo-
ries have certain technical problems, for example they allow the existence of
tachyons. Further they do not easily meet the requirements of Quantum the-
ory, as for example the commutation relations. The diﬃculties are resolved
only in twenty six dimensions.
If the relativistic quantized string is given rotation [17], then we get back the
equation for the Regge trajectories given in (1) above. Here we are dealing
with objects of ﬁnite extension rotating with the velocity of light rather like
spinning black holes.
It must be pointed out that, in superstring theory,
there is an additional term a0

J

≤

(2πT )−1M 2 + a0¯h, with a0 = +1(+2) for

the open (closed) string.

(7)
In equation (7) a0 comes from a zero-point energy eﬀect. When a0 = 1 we
have the usual gauge bosons and when a0 = 2 we have the gravitons.
The theory of Quantum Super Strings in contrast requires only ten dimen-
sions. Here, Quantum operators describing anti-commuting variables satisfy
anti-commutation relations. Indeed this bivalence is a hallmark of supersym-
metry itself.
The extra dimensions that appear in String theories reduce to the four di-
mensions of the physical spacetime by virtue of the fact that the redundant
dimensions are treated as curled up into a negligible extension, in the manner
suggested by Kaluza and later Klein in the early twentieth century. Kaluza’s
original motivation had been to unify electromagnetism and gravitation by
introducing a ﬁfth negligible coordinate. The curling up takes place at the
Planck scale [18].
A ﬁnite extension for an elementary particle, as in String theories can be
shown to lead to new commutation relations, as was done by Snyder in the

forties.
Snyder’s original motivation had been to fudge and eliminate singularities
and divergences in Quantum ﬁelds. We remark that what this implies is that
space coordinates in some sense take on the character of momenta in addi-
tion, though this happens at very small scales or high energies. Eﬀectively

What all this means is we cannot go down to lower and lower scales arbi-
trarily. As we approach the minimum length we return to the larger universe
[19]. We will return to this point a little later.
The interesting thing about Quantum Superstring theory is the natural emer-
gence of the spin 2 graviton as can be seen from (7), or as Witten puts it,
the theory “predicts” gravitation.
Meanwhile Supersymmetry or SUSY developed in parallel. This theory re-
quires that each particle with integral spin has a counterpart with the same
mass but having half integral spin. That is Bosons have their supersymmet-
ric counterparts in Fermions. SUSY is then broken so that the counterparts
would have a much greater mass, which would then account for the fact that
these latter have not been observed. Nevertheless the fact that in this theory
gravitation can be uniﬁed with the other forces makes it attractive.
Infact this had lead to Supergravity in which the spin 2 graviton has the
spin 3/2 counterpart, the gravitino. Supergravity requires eleven spacetime
dimensions, one more than Superstring theory.
Unfortunately Supergravity began to fade from the mid eighties because of
the fact that, as shown by Witten and others, handedness cannot easily
emerge on reduction to the four physical spacetime dimensions from eleven.
On the other hand the Quantum Super String theory was in comparison alto-
gether more satisfactory. We could say that the earlier Bosonic String theory
worked in a spacetime that was Bosonic, there being no place for spin. QSS
works in a Fermionic spacetime where we have the modiﬁcation (8).
So in the mid eighties ten dimensional QSS displaced Supergravity. There
were ﬁve QSS theories - E8 ×
E8 heterotic, SO(32) heterotic, the Type I,
the Type IIA and Type IIB. Of these the Type I is an open string while the
E8 appeared to explain many features of
others form closed loops. The E8 ×
elementary particles and their forces.
However there were some disturbing questions. Why were there ﬁve diﬀerent
theories? After all we need a unique theory. And then why ten dimensions,
while Supersymmetry allows eleven dimensions? Another not very convinc-
ing factor was the fact that particles were being represented as one dimen-
sional strings. Surely a more general formulation as noted above would have
two dimensional surfaces or membranes or even p-dimensional entities which

5

we may call p-branes. This generalization resembles the earlier attempt of
Dirac’s representing particles as a shell or membrane. Infact if the radius of
the circle shrinks, the mebrane begins to resemble a rolled up object in ten
dimensions. It reduces to a Type IIA Superstring.
In such deformations certain topological properties can remain conserved.
A good example is a knot in a set of ﬁeld lines. Such knots or solitons re-
main as such and exhibit a particle type behaviour. A magnetic monopole
can be characterized in this way, that is as a twisted knot of magnetic lines.
It can be said to carry a topological charge. This is to be contrasted with
the charges carried by particles like electrons and quarks which can be put
within the framework of the Noether Conservation Theorem. In this context
an interesting conjecture is that of Montonen and Olive [20]: There could
be a dual formulation in which the roles of the usual charges and topologi-
cal charges are reversed. In such a formulation for example a particle with
charge e would show up as a soliton with charge 1
e .
Over the past few years, a variant called M Theory arising from these general-
izations has attracted much attention. This theory also uses Supersymmetry,
which is broken so that the postulated particles do not have the same mass as
the known particles. Further these new masses must be much too heavy to be
detected by current accelerators. The advantage of Supersymmetry is that a
framework is now available for the uniﬁcation of all the interactions includ-
ing gravitation. It may be mentioned that under a SUSY transformation,
the laws of physics are the same for all observers, which is the case in Gen-
eral Relativity (Gravitation) also. Under SUSY there can be a maximum
of eleven dimensions, the extra dimensions being curled up as in Kaluza-
Klein theories. In this case there can only be an integral number of waves
around the circle, giving rise to particles with quantized energy. However
for observers in the other four dimensions, it would be quantized charges,
not energies. The unit of charge would depend on the radius of the circle,
the Planck radius yielding the value e. This is the root of the uniﬁcation of
electromagnetism and gravitation in these theories.
The relevance of all this is that p-branes can be characterized as solitons.
For example a ten dimensional string can show up as a p-brane with p = 5.
In this case a strongly interacting string would be the dual of a weakly in-
teracting 5-brane. In 1990 the Montonen-Olive duality which was between
electricity and magnetism in ordinary four dimensional space, was general-
ized to four dimensional Superstrings.
This duality was called S-duality, to distinguish it from the well known T-

6

duality which relates two kinds of particles that arise when the string loops
around by a compact dimension: There would be vibrations on the one hand
and multiple windings on the other. Winding particles over a circle of radius
r correspond to vibrating particles in a circle of radius 1/r and conversely
on the lines of (8). Such a behaviour is characteristic of minimum spacetime
intervals. In this picture the solitonic interaction is given by the reciprocal
of the string interaction, in conﬁrmity with the Montonen-Olive conjecture.
A further interesting development was the realization that in the reduction
of the dimensions of spacetime to four dimensions the string and the cor-
responding soliton each acquire a T-duality. Moreover the T-duality of the
solitonic string is the S-duality of the fundamental string and conversely. We
have here a duality of dualities. It also implies that the interaction charges
in one universe show up as sizes in the dual.
Further the eleventh and extra dimension of the M-Theory could be shrunk,
so that there would be two ten dimensional universes connected by the eleven
dimensional spacetime. Now particles and strings would exist in the parallel
universes which can interact through gravitation. The interesting aspect of
the above scenario is that it is possible to concieve of all the four interactions
converging at an energy far less than the Planck energy (1019GeV ). Infact the
Planck energy is so high that it is beyond forseeable experiments. Thus this
would bring the eleven dimensional M-Theory closer to experiment. There
have been further developments involving what are called Dirichlet surfaces.
It is now suspected that black holes can be treated as intersecting black
branes wrapped around seven curled up dimensions. There is here, an inter-
esting interface between M-Theory and black hole physics [21]. In M-Theory,
the position coordinates become matrices and this leads to, as we will see, a
noncommutative geometry or fuzzy spacetime in which spacetime points are
no longer well deﬁned [22]

[x, y]

= 0

From this point of view the mysterious M in M-Theory could stand for
Matrix, rather than Membrane. In any case, as we will argue, fuzzy spacetime
may well hold the key for the uniﬁcation of all interactions.
So M-Theory is the new avatar of QSS. Nevertheless it is still far from being
the last word. There are still any number of routes for compressing ten
dimensions to our four dimensions. There is still no contact with experiment.
It also appears that these theories lead to an unacceptably high cosmological
constant and so on.

3 Planck Oscillators

As we have seen, and this as noted being true in Quantum Gravity as well as
in Quantum Super String Theory, we encounter phenomena at a minimum
scale. It is well known, and this was realized by Planck himself, that there
is an absolute minimum scale in the universe, and this is,

Yet what we encounter in the real world is, not the Planck scale, but the
elementary particle Compton scale. The explanation given for this is that the
very high energy Planck scale is moderated by the Uncertainty Principle. The
question which arises is, exactly how does this happen? We will now present
an argument to show how the Planck scale leads to the real world Compton
scale, via ﬂuctuations and the modiﬁcation of the Uncertainty Principle.
We note that (9) deﬁnes the absolute minimum physical scale [23, 24, 25, 26].
Associated with (9) is the Planck mass

There are certain interesting properties associated with (9) and (10). lP is the
Schwarzschild radius of a black hole of mass mP while tP is the evaporation
time for such a black hole via the Beckenstein radiation [27]. Interestingly
tP is also the Compton time for the Planck mass, a circumstance that is
symptomatic of the fact that at this scale, electromagnetism and gravitation
become of the same order.
Indeed all this ﬁts in very well with Rosen’s
analysis that such a Planck scale particle would be a mini universe [28, 29].
We will now invoke a time varying gravitational constant

which resembles the Dirac cosmology and features in another scheme to be
discussed elsewhere (Cf.ref.[12]), in which (11) arises due to the ﬂuctuation
in the particle number [30, 31, 32, 33]. In (11) m and l are the mass and

Compton wavelength of a typical elementary particle like the pion while
1080 is the number of elementary particles in the universe, and T is the

age of the universe.
In this scheme wherein (11) follows from the theory, we use the fact that
given N particles, the ﬂuctuation in the particle number is of the order √N ,
¯h/mc2, the Compton
while a typical time interval for the ﬂuctuations is
time. We will come back to this point later. So anticipating later work we

and we can also deduce its spatial counterpart, R = √Nl, which is the well
known empirical Eddington formula. We will return to this later.
Equation (11) which is an order of magnitude relation is consistent with
observation [34, 35] while it may be remarked that the Dirac cosmology itself
has inconsistencies.
Substitution of (11) in (9) yields

where t as noted is the typical Compton time of an elementary particle. We
can easily verify that (12) is correct. It must be stressed that (12) is not a
fortuitous empirical coincidence, but rather is a result of using (11), which
again as noted, can be deduced from theory.
(12) can be rewritten as

wherein we have used (9) and (11) and n = √N .
We will now compare (13) with the well known relations, referred to earlier,

R = √N l T = √Nt

The ﬁrst relation of (14) is the well known Weyl-Eddington formula referred
to while the second relation of (14) is given also on the right side of (11).

(12)

(13)

(14)

We now observe that (14) can be seen to be the result of a Brownian Walk
process, l, t being typical intervals between ”steps” (Cf.[30, 36, 37]). We
demonstrate this below after equation (16). On the other hand, the typical
intervals l, t can be seen to result from a diﬀusion process themselves. Let
us consider the well known diﬀusion relation,

(15)

(Cf.[36],[38]-[41]). What is being done here is that we are modeling fuzzy
spacetime by a double Wiener process to be touched upon later, which leads
to (15). This will be seen in more detail, below.
Indeed as l is the Compton wavelength, (15) can be rewritten as the Quantum
Mechanical Uncertainty Principle

at the Compton scale (Cf. also [42]) (or even at the de Broglie scale).
What (15) shows is that a Brownian process deﬁnes the Compton scale while
(14) shows that a Random Walk process with the Compton scale as the
interval deﬁnes the length and time scales of the universe itself (Cf.[37]).
Returning now to (13), on using (10), we observe that in complete analogy
with (15) we have the relation

(∆x)2

(16)

(17)

We can now argue that the Brownian process (16) deﬁnes the Planck length
while a Brownian Random Walk process with the Planck scale as the interval
leads to (13), that is the Compton scale.
To see all this in greater detail, it may be observed that equation (16) (with-
out subscripts)

(∆x)2 =

∆t

¯h
m

is the same as the equation (15), indicative of a double Wiener process.
Indeed as noted by several scholars, this deﬁnes the fractal Quantum path
of dimension 2 (rather than dimension 1) (Cf.e.g. ref.[39]).
Firstly it must be pointed out that equation (17) deﬁnes a minimum space
time unit - the Compton scale (l, t). This follows from (17) if we substitute
∆t imax = c. If the mass of the particle is the Planck mass, then this
into it

Compton scale becomes the Planck scale.
Let us now consider the distance traversed by a particle with the speed of
light through the time interval T . The distance R covered would be

by conventional reasoning. In view of the equation (17), however we would
have to consider ﬁrstly, the minimum time interval t (Compton or Planck
time), so that we have

dx = R = c

dt = cT

Z

Secondly, because the square of the space interval ∆x (rather than the inter-
val ∆x itself as in conventional theory) appears in (17), the left side of (18)
becomes, on using (19)

Z
Whence for the linear dimension R we would have

dx2

√nR = nct

or R = √nl

Equation (20) brings out precisely the fractal dimension D = 2 of the Brow-
nian path while (21) is identical to (12) or (14) (depending on whether we
are dealing with minimum intervals of the Planck scale or Compton scale of
elementary particles). Apart from showing the Brownian character linking
equations (12) and (17), incidentally, this also provides the justiﬁcation for
what has so far been considered to be a mysterious large number coincidence
viz. the Eddington formula (14).
There is another way of looking at this. It is well known that in approaches
like that of the author or Quantum Super String Theory, at the Planck scale
we have a non commutative geometry encountered earlier [43, 44] Indeed
as noted, a noncommutative geometry follows without recourse to Quantum
Super Strings, merely by the fact that lP , tP are the absolute minimum space
time intervals as we saw earlier.
The non commutative geometry, as is known, is symptomatic of a modiﬁed
uncertainty principle at this scale [44]-[50]

The relation (22) would be true even in Quantum Gravity. The extra or
second term on the right side of (22) expresses the well known duality eﬀect
- as we attempt to go down to the Planck scale, infact we are lead to the
larger scale. The question is, what is this larger scale? If we now use the fact
that √n is the ﬂuctuation in the number of Planck particles (exactly as √N
was the ﬂuctuation in the particle number as in (11)) so that √nmpc = ∆p
is the ﬂuctuation or uncertainty in the momentum for the second term on
the right side of (22), we obtain for the uncertainty in length,

∆x = l2
P

(23)

We can easily see that (23) is the same as the ﬁrst relation of (13). The
second relation of (13) follows from an application of the time analogue of
(22).
Thus the impossibility of going down to the Planck scale because of (22),
manifests itself in the fact that as we attempt to go down to the Planck
scale, we infact end up at the Compton scale. In the next section we will
give another demonstration of this result. This is how the Compton scale is
encountered in real life.
Interestingly while at the Planck length, we have a life time of the order of
the Planck time, as noted above it is possible to argue on the other hand
that with the mass and length of a typical elementary particle like the pion,
at the Compton scale, we have a life time which is the age of the universe
itself as shown by Sivaram [27, 51].
Interestingly also Ng and Van Dam deduce the relations like [52]

(T t2

(24)

where the left side of (24) represents the uncertainty in the measurement of
length and time for an interval L, T . We would like to point out that if in
the above we use for L, T , the size and age of the universe, then ∆L and ∆T
reduce to the Compton scale l, t.
In conclusion, Brownian double Wiener processes and the modiﬁcation of
the Uncertainity Principle at the Planck scale lead to the physical Compton
scale.

4 The Universe as Planck Oscillators

In the previous section, we had argued that a typical elementary particle like
1040 evanescent Planck
a pion could be considered to be the result of n
scale particles. The argument was based on random motions and also on the
modiﬁcation to the Uncertainity Principle. We will now consider the problem
from a diﬀerent point of view, which not only reconﬁrms the above result,
but also enables an elegant extension to the case of the entire universe itself.
Let us consider an array of N particles, spaced a distance ∆x apart, which
behave like oscillators, that is as if they were connected by springs. We then
have [53, 54]

hole of Planck mass. Indeed, as noted, Rosen had shown that a Planck mass

which of course is the well known formula for the Hagedorn temperature for
elementary particles like pions. In other words, this conﬁrms the conclusions

in the previous section, that we can treat an elementary particle as a series
of some 1040 Planck mass oscillators. However it must be observed from
(26) and (27), that while the Planck mass gives the highest energy state, an
elementary particle like the pion is in the lowest energy state. This explains
why we encounter elementary particles, rather than Planck mass particles
Infact as already noted, a Planck mass particle decays via the

Bekenstein radiation within a Planck time
the lifetime of an elementary particle would be very much higher.
In any case the eﬃcacy of our above oscillator model can be seen by the
fact that we recover correctly the masses and Compton scales in the order of
magnitude sense and also get the correct Bekenstein and Hagedorn formulas
as seen above, and get the correct estimate of the mass of the universe itself,
as will be seen below.
1080 elementary particles
Using the fact that the universe consists of N
like the pions, the question is, can we think of the universe as a collection of
nN or 10120 Planck mass oscillators? This is what we will now show. Infact

which gives the correct mass M, of the universe which in contrast to the
earlier pion case, is the highest energy state while the Planck oscillators in-
dividually are this time the lowest in this description. In other words the
universe itself can be considered to be described in terms of normal modes
of Planck scale oscillators.
We will return to these considerations later: this and the preceeding consid-
erations merely set the stage.

5 Fuzzy Spacetime

Thus we are lead to a minimum scale which is the Compton scale in the real
world. Once such a minimum spacetime scale is invoked, then we have a non
commutative geometry as shown by Snyder more than ﬁfty years ago [55]:

[x, y] = (ıa2/¯h)Lz, [t, x] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mx, etc.

14

x];

(30)

[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2
The relations (30) are compatible with Special Relativity. Indeed such min-
imum spacetime models were studied for several decades, precisely to over-
come the divergences encountered in Quantum Field Theory [56]-[64].
Before proceeding further, it may be remarked that when the square of a,
which we will take to be the Compton wavelength (including the Planck
scale, which is a special case of the Compton scale for a Planck mass viz.,
10−5gm), in view of the above comments can be neglected, then we return
to point Quantum Theory.
It is interesting that starting from the usual Dirac coordinate we can deduce
the non commutative geometry (30), independently. For this we note that
the α’s in the Dirac coordinate are given by

~α =

~σ 0
0 ~σ #

"

,

the σ’s being the Pauli matrices. We next observe that the ﬁrst term on the
right hand side is the usual Hermitian position. For the second term which
contains α, we can easily verify from the commutation relations of the σ’s
that

[xı, xj] = βıj ·

l2

(31)

where l is the Compton scale.
There is another way of looking at this. Let us consider the Dirac coor-
dinate to be complex, reminiscent of Newman’s original complexiﬁcation of
the coordinate. We now try to generalize this complex coordinate to three
dimensions. Then we encounter a surprise - we end up with not three, but
four dimensions,

(1, ı)

(I, σ),

→

×

where I is the unit 2
2 matrix. We get the special relativisitc Lorentz
invariant metric at the same time. (In this sense, as noted by Sachs [65],
Hamilton who made this generalization would have also hit upon special rel-
ativity, if he had identiﬁed the fourth coordinate with time).
That is,

→
where (ı, j, k) now represent the Pauli matrices; and, further,

x + ıy

is invariant.
While the usual Minkowski four vector transforms as the basis of the four
dimensional representation of the Poincare group, the two dimensional rep-
resentation of the same group, given by the right hand side in terms of
Pauli matrices, obeys the quaternionic algebra of the second rank spinors
(Cf.Ref.[66, 67, 68] for details).
To put it brieﬂy, the quarternion number ﬁeld obeys the group property and
this leads to a number system of quadruplets as a minimum extension. In
fact one representation of the two dimensional form of the quarternion basis
elements is the set of Pauli matrices. Thus a quarternion may be expressed
in the form

Q =

ıσµxµ = σ0x4

ıσ1x1

ıσ2x2

ıσ3x3 = (σ0x4 + ı~σ

~r)

This can also be written as

−

Q =

ıx4 + x3 x1
ıx4

.

!

As can be seen from the above, there is a one to one correspondence between
a Minkowski four-vector and Q. The invariant is now given by Q ¯Q, where ¯Q
is the complex conjugate of Q.
However, as is well known, there is a lack of spacetime reﬂection symmetry
in this latter formulation. If we require reﬂection symmetry also, we have to
consider the four dimensional representation,

(I, ~σ)

→ " 

I

−

,

I !

 

0 ~σ
~σ 0 !# ≡

(Γµ)

(Cf.also.ref. [67] for a detailed discussion). The motivation for such a reﬂec-
tion symmetry is that usual laws of physics, like electromagnetism do indeed
show the symmetry.
We at once deduce spin and special relativity and the geometry (4). This
is a transition that has been long overlooked [66]. Conversely it must be
mentioned that spin half itself is relational and refers to three dimensions,
to a spin network infact [69]. That is, spin half is not meaningful in a single
particle universe.
Equally interesting is the fact that starting from the geometry (4) we can
deduce the Dirac equation itself.

16

While a relation like (31) above has been in use recently, in non commutative
models, and as noted, was an independent starting point due to the work of
Snyder, we would like to stress that it has been overlooked that the origin of
this non commutativity lies in the original Dirac coordinates.
The above relation shows on comparison with the position-momentum com-
mutator that the coordinate ~x also behaves like a “momentum”. This can
be seen directly from the Dirac theory itself where we have [30]

c2~p
H −
In (32), the ﬁrst term is the usual momentum. The second term is the extra
“momentum” ~p due to zitterbewegung.
Infact we can easily verify from (32) that

c~α =

2ı
¯h

(32)

ˆxH

~p =

H 2
¯hc2 ˆx

(33)

(34)

where ˆx has been deﬁned in (32).
We ﬁnally investigate what the angular momentum
the angular momentum at the Compton scale. We can easily show that

~p gives - that is,

×

∼

~x

(~x

~p)z =

(~α

~p)z =

×

c
E

×

c

(p2α1 −

p1α2)

where E is the eigen value of the Hamiltonian operator H. Equation (34)
shows that the usual angular momentum but in the context of the Compton
scale, leads to the “mysterious” Quantum Mechanical spin.
In the above considerations, we started with the Dirac equation and de-
duced the underlying non commutative geometry of space time. Interestingly,
starting with Snyder’s non commutative geometry, based solely on Lorentz
invariance and a minimum spacetime length, which we have taken to be the
Compton scale, (4), it is possible to deduce the relations (34), (33) and the
Dirac equation itself as noted [70] and as we will see shortly.
We have thus established the correspondence between considerations start-
ing from the Dirac theory of the electron and Snyder’s (and subsequent)
approaches based on a minimum spacetime interval and Lorentz covariance.
It can be argued from an alternative point of view that special relativity
operates outside the Compton wavelength (Cf.ref.[30]).
We could have started with the Kerr-Newman Black Hole. Infact the deriva-
tion of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole itself begins with a Quantum Mechan-
ical spin yielding complex shift, which Newman has found inexplicable even

17

after several decades [71, 72]. As he observed, “...one does not understand
why it works. After many years of study I have come to the conclusion that
it works simply by accident”. And again, “Notice that the magnetic moment
µ = ea can be thought of as the imaginary part of the charge times the
displacement of the charge into the complex region... We can think of the
source as having a complex center of charge and that the magnetic moment
is the moment of charge about the center of charge... In other words the total
complex angular momentum vanishes around any point za on the complex
world-line. From this complex point of view the spin angular momentum is
identical to orbital, arising from an imaginary shift of origin rather than a
real one... If one again considers the particle to be “localized” in the sense
that the complex center of charge coincides with the complex center of mass,
one again obtains the Dirac gyromagnetic ratio...”
The unanswered question has been, why does a complex shift somehow rep-
resent spin about that axis? The answer to this question lies in the above
considerations. Complexiﬁed space time is symptomatic of fuzzy space time
and a non commutative geometry and Quantum Mechanical spin [73]. Indeed
Zakrzewski has shown in a classical context that non commutativity implies
spin [74, 75].
The above considerations used the Quantum Mechanical spin together with
classical relativity, though the price to pay for this was minimum space time
intervals and noncommutative geometry. Is this the path towards a reconcil-
iation of electromagnetism and gravitation?

6 Discussion

In String Theory we have the vibration of one dimensional strings at the
Planck scale with mechanical concepts like tension, playing a role. In the
case of Planck oscillators, we have a one dimensional oscillator associated
with the background Zero Point Field or Dark Energy. In String Theory the
diﬀerent vibrational modes corresponds to diﬀerent particles. In the latter
case collective modes of one dimensional oscillators constitute an elementary
particle at the Compton scale. Moreover this leads to noncommutative geom-
etry and fuzzy spacetime at the Compton scale l, τ with a quantum of area.
If O(l2) is neglected we get back ordinary Quantum Mechanics, or retaining
l2 we get a rationale for the Dirac equation. Moreover if ﬂuctuations are
∼
considered out of the background Zero Point Field we recover a cosmology

18

→

with acceleration and a small cosmological constant, which goes over to the
Big Bang cosmology in the limit l
0. In String Theory on the other hand,
there is no such limit to conventional physics and moreover the cosmological
constant is some 10120 times its observed value. Moreover there are extra di-
mensions - ten or eleven as in the latest version of M-Theory. No such extra
dimensions are required in the latter theory. String Theory ﬁnds a place for
the graviton while the latter theory recovers linearized gravitation from the
noncommutative structure and gives a distributional picture of gravity, one
in which gravitation is not fundamental [30].
So both theories originate in one dimension at the Planck Scale, but the latter
theory goes on to describe the universe at the Planck scale as a large poly-
mer, whereas the description is diﬀerent at the Compton scale. In fact at this
scale we encounter two dimensions and a breakdown of the coherence seen in
the Planck scale polymer. At even greater distances we encounter the three
dimensional physical space [76]. Moreover the picture is Machian and all the
hitherto supposedly mysterious coincidences are actually consequences of the
theory. Furthermore there is a mass spectrum for all the known elementary
particles and other experimental eﬀects [30].

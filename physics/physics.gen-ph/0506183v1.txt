Class of Source of Cosmic Particle Acceleration

It is known that spinning pulsars could be source of VHE-UHE cosmic particle acceleration. It is also conjec-
tured that (ﬁctitious) spinning Black Holes (BH) could be sites of cosmic particle acceleration. However, it has
been shown by Mitra[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and Leiter and Robertson[6] that General Relativity (GR) actually does not
allow the existence or formation of ﬁnite mass BHs! It was predicted that the BH Candiadates (BHCs) have
strong intrinsic magnetic ﬁelds (like pulsars) instead of Event Horizons. And this prediction has tentatively
been veriﬁed in a series of papers by Robertson & Leiter and Schild[7, 8, 9, 10]. Thus all observed BH Candi-
dates are actually not BHs, and, they are expected to be MECOs. In fact, “MECO” has been listed as one of the
frequently used abbreviations in current A& A literature (www.phys.uni
sof ia.bg/ astro.html). Stellar
mass MECOs are GR analogs of conventionally known isolated pulsars. While pulsars are/have (i) COLD, i.e.,

Introduction

Cosmic Ray Acceleration may take place in several kinds of sites. One kind of sites could be of extended nature,
e.g., Supernova Remnants (SNRs), Pulsar Wind Schocks/Nebula (PWNs), or Jets. The other kind could direcly
involve Compact Objects such as Spinning Neutron Stars, i.e., Pulsars and (ﬁctitious) Spinning Black Holes.
The accretion shocks around such compact objects might also be the sites of acceleration even when such
compact objects would not spin. In particular, for extragalactic point sources, we invariably invoke massive
BHs as the Central Compact Object (CCO). But it is time now to have a fundamental revision of this idea in the
light of theoretical astrophysics/GR research carried out in past few years. Although it will sound unthinkable,
it is a hard fact that, it has been unequivocally shown that the supposed BH candidates cannot be BHs and
they must be something else[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Within the context of the classical GR, this “something else”
has turned out to Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECOs) and their speciﬁc version: Magnetospheric Eternally
Collapsing Objects (MECOs)[?]. The locally measured surface magnetic ﬁeld of ECOs were predicted to
be signiﬁcantly higher than typical pulsar values[?], and, the naturally, spinning ECOs/MECOs could beat
the pulsars as sources of acceleration of high energy ions/electrons. In the present paper, we would like to
introduce ECOs/MECOs to cosmic ray astrophysicists in general and also argue why ECOs are (rather than
BHs) inevitable products of collapse of massive stars.

2. Reasons for Non-existence of BHs

It is true that the so-called vacuum Schwarzschild solution of GR apparently makes a strong case of existence
for BHs. This solution involves an integration constant α0 which is interpreted as twice the mass of the BH:
α0 = 2GM0/c2

(1)

It has all along been assumed that this

integration constant can have arbitrary ﬁnite value. But by application of basic differential geometry, it has

been shown recently, that, actually, this integration constant is unique: α0
Schwarzschild solution is only of notional value in the sense that BHs have a unique mass M0
0, and as far
as real objects (M > 0) are concerned, they cannot be BHs. What are the physical reasons for non-occurrence
of ﬁnite mass BHs?

1. It turns out that the radius of the BH is none other than α0 and the ﬁctitious boundary with r = α0 = rg
is called the “Event Horizon” (EH). In case there would be a ﬁnite mass (and radius) BH, then the speed
of any material particle would become v = c at the EH. Further one would have v > c for r < α0.

This would be in violation of GR and hence there cannot be a region with r < α0. In other words one
must have α0 = 2GM0/c2

3. It has all along been assumed that if a massive star would collapse, somehow a trapped surface would
be generated - and once a trapped surface would be formed, the formation of a BH would be inevitable.

But it has been shown, in a highly transparent and exact manner, that GR actually does not allow forma-
tion of trapped surfaces[4].

4. The physical reason for non-occurrence of trapped surfaces is again essentially the same: Formation of

a trapped surface corresponds to a speed of the collapsing ﬂuid v

c in violation of GR.

3. Then What Happens?

To appreciate this, one has to recall the deﬁnition of “Gravitational Redshift” z associated with any spherical
object of mass M and radius R[11]:

1 + z = (1

2GM/Rc2)−1/2

As a result, once the collapse is strong enough to overcome the NS stage, for sufﬁciently massive stars, the
radiation generated during the collapse becomes virtually trapped within the collapsing body as ψ
0 (al-
most). It is quite likely that the luminosity of the trapped radiation attains the appropriate Eddington value at
extremely high value of z. And it is this trapped radiation and the associated pressure which virtually halts
the collapse to make a quasi steady ECO.

Since an ECO corresponds to a gravitational collapse much more intense than the formulation of a NS, the
intrinsic magnetic ﬁeld of the ECOs (atleast the young ones) are expected to be much higher than the corre-
sponding NS values: B

3.1 What is a MECO?

Roberson & Leiter[7, 8, 9] found that the X-ray as well as radio observations from all stellar mass binary NSs
and BHcs can be understood in terms of the ECO model where the magnetic energy density is almost as strong
1016−17 G, and ECOs with such super strong B are called MECOs.

2. What about the Upper Limit of Mass of Neutron Stars?

Both Chandrasekhar Limit and NS upper mass Limit correspond to cold objects, i.e., objects primarily
supported by cold degeneracy pressure. Objects which are not primarily supported by such degeneracy

1011M⊙. However such objects are not compact. Nonetheless, stable supermassive stars, supported

by radiation pressure, can have arbitrary high mass and compactness somewhat smaller than NSs.

ECOs are GR version of unstable radiation/magnetic pressure supported objects and GR very much
admits their existence by means of the Vaidya Metric. Because of intense internal radiation, the baryonic
plasma of ECOs may not be degenerate at all.

3. If BHs really are not there, how is it that almost all GR experts and astrophysicists have been using it

and getting nice results too?

This question is essentially a sociological question and has been partly answered in the small article :
Why no “New Einstein” by Lee Smolin[12].

Invariably, they avoid the EH and work away from it, e.g., like the “Membrane Paradigm”[13] where
one virtually replaces the EH by a physical conducting surface above it! In fact, these authors admit
(p.46)[13] that:

“The mental deceit of stretching the horizon is made mathematically viable, indeed very attractive, by
the elegant set of membrane-like boundary conditions to which it leads at the stretched horizon....”

If BHs were physical objects, there would not have been any the need for a “mental deceit” and they
could have been treated exactly without the prop of a “membrane”.

5. Conclusions

The so-called BH candidates are most likely to be ECOs. An isolated spinning ECO, by virtue of both super
strong magnetic ﬁeld and gravitational ﬁeld, will generate an induced electric ﬁeld much stronger than the
conventional pulsars. Although, Robertson & Leiter have constructed reasonably self-consistent model of
107−8 for observed stellar mass BHCs, there could
ECOs (MECOs) with a range of B
be ECOs with much lower B and z and which might be unidentiﬁed at present. For various physical properties
of MECOs/ECOs, the reader is referred to[10]. It may be mentioned that as far as detail internal structure
of a quasar is concerned, probably, Q0591+561 makes the best case as it has been studied for 40 years. In
particular, 25 years of gravitational lensing and microlensing studies have revealed an internal structure which
cannot be understood by the BH paradigm. On the other hand, the MECO model has been successful in ﬁxing
some of basic structure parameters[10]. More on ECO accelerators will be presented in an adjacent paper[14].

Abstract

Stemming from simple postulates of nondecelerative nature of the universe expan-
sion and Vaidya metric application, the paper oﬀers some dependences and relations
between the gravity and weak interactions. It presents a mode of independent deter-
mination of the mass of vector bosons Z and W, and it derives the time of separation
of electromagnetic and weak interactions. Comparisons of theoretically derived and
experimentally obtained data indicate the relevancy of the used mode and provide a
hint for further investigation. The W and Z bosons mass of about 100 GeV, together
with the time and the Universe radius of electromagnetic and weak interactions sep-
aration approaching tx = 10−10 s and ax = 10−2 m, respectively, were obtained using
our approach. The above values match well those commonly accepted.

1 Introduction

The issue of uniﬁcation of all four known physical forces is still one of the top-ten evergreens
of theoretical physics. There are several approaches allowing to come to theoretical results
which, in principle, do not contradict to the generally accepted physical principles and
oﬀer at least a partial solution of the matter. Among the approaches, the Standard Model
[1–3] (which does not, however, provide a complete description of Nature since it does not
address gravitational interactions), and the Superstring Theory [4–6], trying to become
the Theory of Everything are to be mentioned. Within the elaboration of the mentioned
and other theoretical approaches and their veriﬁcation based on available experimental
cosmological and particle physics data, several important achievements have been reached.

1

Frequently, the approaches involve the inﬂationary Universe [7] as a starting point.
In this approach, the observable part of the Universe (its radius a) is emerging by the
velocity of the light and, in turn, the Universe mass is gradually increasing. The same
results may be obtained applying a hypothesis on nondecelerative expansion of the Universe
(without the previous inﬂationary phase) with mass creation [8, 9]. The approaches diﬀer
mainly in metrics used since to describe the mass creation, the Vaidya metric [10, 11]
or another metric implicitly involving such a creation must be involved. The Vaidya
metric and the hypothesis on the matter creation has manifested its justiﬁcation when
explained both some macroworld (cosmological) and microworld (particle physics) issues,
such as rationalization and prediction of neutron star properties [8], questions concerning
the entropy of the universe [9], estimation of lower and upper mass limits of black holes [12],
explanation of Podkletnov’s phenomenon [13], clariﬁcation of the internal structure and
parameters of the hydrogen atom [14], prediction of bands in far-infrared low-temperature
spectra of chemical compounds [15].

A possibility of our approach to contribute to understanding the interactions of gravita-
tional, electrostatic and electromagnetic ﬁelds [16] we have taken as a challenge to exploit
the approach in an attempt to oﬀer the applicability of Vaidya metric and the approach
of nondecelerative expansion of the Universe in understanding of weak and gravitational
forces uniﬁcation. The results obtained are presented in this paper.

2 Energy of Z and W bosons

In the early stage of the Universe creation, i.e. in the leptons era an equilibrium of protons
and neutrons formation existed at the temperature about 109 - 1010 K. The amount of
neutrons was stabilized due to weak interactions, which were responsible for processes
such as

The cross section σ corresponding to the above processes may be expressed [17, 18] as

where gF is the Fermi constant (1.4 × 10−62 J m3), Ew is the energy of weak interactions
that, based on (3), can be formulated by relation

where r represents the eﬀective range of weak interactions. Stemming from relation (4) it
holds that in a limiting case when

Relations (5) and (6) represent the Compton wavelength of the vector bosons Z and W,
and their energy, respectively. Equations (4), (5) and (6) lead to the following expression

providing the value that is in good agreement with the currently accepted value [19].

3 Localization of gravitational energy

The following part deals with a mode of expressing the localization of gravitational energy
based on ideas of nondecelerative expansion of the Universe and application of Vaidya
metric. Divergence of Einstein relation

leads, in case of weak ﬁelds, to

Inside the body, the scalar curvature R can be obtained by calculation. It follows that

where εs is the energy density of source.
For the region outside the body,

where εg is the energy density of gravitational ﬁeld.

Scalar curvature is calculable only in the case of Vaidya metric [10, 11] application. The
necessity of the Vaidya metric introduction deserves some words of justiﬁcation. Suppose,
the Universe horison is expanding by the velocity of light c, i.e.

and

a = ctU
where a is the radius of the visible part of the Universe, tU is the cosmological time. At
the same time, new mass is emerging at the horison, i.e. the mass of the visible part of the
Universe mU is increasing obeying the relation

Applying Vaidya metric and using relations (12), (13) and (14), the scalar curvature R
outside the body is obtained in the form

where Rg is the gravitational radius of a body with the mass m, r is the distance. Inserting
(15) into (9), a formula for gravitational energy density εg is obtained

4 Relation between the weak and gravitational inter-

actions

The Universe radius a reaches at present

As a starting point for unifying the gravitational and weak interactions, the conditions
in which the weak interaction energy Ew and the gravitational energy Eg of a hypothetic
body with a limit mass mlim

can be chosen. Based on relations (4) and (16) in such a case it holds

where r is the eﬀective range of weak interaction. It follows from (19) that

The above relation manifests that the limit mass depends on the Universe radius, i.e. it is
increasing with time.

Let us see what happens if the limit mass equals the Planck mass mP c (2.1767 × 10−8

It stems from (20) and (21) that

Substitution of (22) into (24) leads to (7) which means that the mass of the vector bosons
Z and W as well as the time of separation of the electromagnetic and weak interactions
are directly obtained, based on the used approach, in an independent way.

If Planck length lP c is substituted for a in equation (20), the limit mass will approach
to 10−41 kg corresponding to the rest energy of 10−5 eV. It might represent a rest energy
of some of the neutrinos.

5 Conclusions

1. The Vaidya metric allowing to localize the gravitational energy exhibits its capability

to manifest some common features of the gravitational and weak interactions.

2. The paper presents an independent mode of determination of the mass of vector
bosons Z and W, as well as the time of separation of the electromagnetic and weak
interactions. The mode follows directly from the ability to localize gravitational
energy density ouside a body.

3. The paper follows up our previous contributions showing the unity of the fundamental
physical interactions.
It might suggest the existence of a deeper relation of the
weak and gravitational interactions and a common nature of the both interactions
before thein separation. The paper can be considered as a hint for veriﬁcation and
justiﬁcation of the chosen procedure, introduction of Vaidya metric in particular.

The Past Earth’s Rotation

Arbab I. Arbab1

Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, University of Khartoum, 11115 Khartoum, SUDAN.

Summary. We have proposed a model to obtain the length of the day and month at any geologic time.
The day is found to increase by 0.002 sec/century since the seventeenth century. The lengthening of the day is
attributed entirely to the increasing gravitational constant (G) with time that manifested its self in tidal forces.
The data obtained are consistent with those found from Palaeontology. The length of the day 4500 million years
ago was 6 hours and the synodic month was 14.3 present epoch days.

1. INTRODUCTION

There exist certain large dimensionless ratios that may be formed from the fundamental con-
stants of atomic physics and cosmology. In his large number hypothesis (LNH) Dirac proposed
that these ratios are interrelated and are simple functions of cosmic time t. Thus the gravita-
tional constant G, when measured in units of atomic time, varies as t−1. The geophysical and
palaeontolgical data ruled out this variation (Blake, 1978). This is manifested in the past number
of days in a year and the length of the day derived from biological growth rhythms preserved
in the fossil records investigated by Wells (1963). Based on diﬀerent grounds, we have proposed
a diﬀerent temporal variation for G viz. G ∼ t(2n−1)/(1−n) where 1/2 < n < 1 is a constant
related to viscosity. We emphasize that any changes in the Earth-Moon-Sun system are entirely
due to gravitational eﬀects that resulted from changes in G. Thus the ‘eﬀective’ G embodies all
these eﬀects. For instance, the increase of the length of the day is generally attributed to tidal
eﬀects by the Moon on the Earth. Some scientists in celestial mechanics believed that lunar tides
are generally responsible for the tectonic movement of the crust. In our present approach this
variation is due to the increasing gravity that leads to change the tidal eﬀects. It is therefore

G changes the following parameters of the Earth: Radius (R), Number of days in a year (Y ),
Length of the day (D), Earth temperature (T ), and Moment of Inertia (I), will change. In this
note we will be mainly concerned with changes in Y and D and their corresponding magnitudes.

2- THE MODEL

Applying the Kepler’s 2nd and 3rd laws of motion to the Earth-Moon system, neglecting the

orbit eccentricity, one obtains

G2[(M + m)2m3]T = 2πL3 , G[(M + m)m2]r = L2

(1)

and

G2[(M + Ms)2M 3]Y = 2πN 3 , G[(M + Ms)M 2]R = N 2
for the Earth-Sun system, where m, M and Ms are the masses of the Moon, Earth and Sun
respectively; L and N are their orbital angular momenta; R and r are the distance between
Moon-Earth and Earth-Sun, respectively; Y and T are the length of the year and the sidereal
month, respectively. The synodic month (T s) is related to the sidereal month by the relation T s =
T (1 − T /Y )−1. While the lunar tidal friction resulted in angular momentum being transferred
from the Earth’s rotation about its axis to the orbital angular momentum of the Moon, the
orbital angular momentum of the Earth around the Sun is nearly constant. From equation (1)
and (2), one can write,

a relation that is valid at any geologic time (t). To ﬁt the results obtained by Wells, one would
require the gravitational constant to vary as G ∼ t1.3 and the present age of the universe (t0) to
be 11 × 109 year. Similarly, to ﬁt the data obtained by Runcorn for the ratio L
L0 = 1.016 ± 0.003
for the Devonian, one requires L to vary as L ∼ t0.43. Thus one can write the time dependent
(evolution) of the above quantities as

G = G0(

)1.3 , Y = Y0(

)−2.6 , D = D0(

)2.6 , L = L0(

)0.43 , T = T0(

(in this note the subscript ‘0’ denotes the present value of the quantity). Table 1 shows Wells’s
fossil data for the length of the year in the past and Table 2 shows our results.
In fact, the
year is the same as before but the length of the day was shorter than now. Sonett et al. (1996)
have shown that the length of the day 900 m.y ago was 19.2 hrs and the year contained 456
days. This result is indeed what we obtain for that era. Recently, Williams (1997) has found
the length of the day for the Precambrian from tidal rhythmite palaeotidal values. We would
like to comment that the values he quoted belong to diﬀerent eras in our model (see Table 3).

Ksanfomality (1997) has shown that according to the principle of isochronism all planets had an
initial period of rotation between 6-8 hrs. However, our model gives a value of 6.1 hrs. Berry
and Baker (1968) have suggested that laminae, ridges and troughs, and bands on present day
and Cretaceous bivalve shells are growth increments of the day and month, respectively. By
counting the number of ridges and troughs they therefore ﬁnd that the number of days in the
month in the late Cretaceous was 29.65±0.18 and the year contained 370.3 days. Extrapolating
the astronomically determined lengthening of the day since the seventeenth century leads to 371
days. As the Earth rotational velocity changes the Earth will adjust its self to maintain its
equilibrium (shape) that is compatible with the new situation. In doing so, the Earth should
have experienced several geologic activities. Accordingly, one would expect that the tectonic
movements have its root in these rotational velocity changes.

3- CONCLUSION

We have proposed a model for the variation of length of the day and month based on the idea
of a variable gravitational constant. This variation can be traced back over the whole history
of the Earth. All perturbations resulting from gravitational eﬀects are included in the coupling
constant G. The change in the Earth’s parameters can be attributed to the eﬀect of changing
gravity with time in the manner shown in this note. The inﬂuence of gravity on the growth of
these corals (biological system) is thus manifested in tidal eﬀects that change the length of the
day and month. These data can be inverted and used as a geological calendar. The data we have
obtained for the length of the day and month should be checked against palaeodata that can be
obtained from diﬀerent disciplines. We have in this note suggested the temporal behavior of the
Earth’s parameters which is consistent with the hitherto known data. Further investigations are
going on in this line.

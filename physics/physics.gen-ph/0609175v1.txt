Abstract

We obtain possibly valuable information about the orientation-tuning of phase diagram of su-

perdense nuclear matter at high fermion as well as boson number density but low temperature,

which is not accessible to relativistic heavy ion collision experiments. Our results resemble those

proposed before by Alford. Possible observational signatures associated with the theoretically

proposed states of matter inside compact stars are discussed as well.

INTRODUCTION

The only place in the universe where we expect suﬃciently high densities and low tem-

peratures is compact stars, also known as ’neutron stars’, since it is often assumed that they

are made primarily of neutrons (for a recent review, see [1]). A compact star is produced in

a supernova. As the outer layers of the star are blown oﬀ into space, the core collapses into

a very dense object. In a broader perspective, neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions pro-

vide access to the phase diagram of matter at extreme densities and temperatures, which is

basic for understanding the very early Universe and several other astrophysical phenomena.

These range from nuclear processes on the stellar surface to processes in electron degen-

erate matter at subnuclear densities to boson condensates and the existence of new states

of baryonic matter such as color superconducting quark matter at supernuclear densities.

More than that, according to the strange matter hypothesis strange quark matter could be

more stable than nuclear matter, in which case neutron stars should be largely composed

of pure quark matter possibly enveloped in thin nuclear crusts. Neutron stars and white

dwarfs are in hydrostatic equilibrium, so at each point inside the star gravity is balanced by

the degenerate particle pressure, as described mathematically by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-

Volkoﬀ equation [2].

It is often stressed that there has never been a more exciting time in the overlapping areas of

nuclear physics, particle physics, and relativistic astrophysics than today [3]. Neutron stars

are dense, neutron-packed remnants of massive stars that blew apart in supernova explosions

[1]. They are typically about twenty kilometers across and spin rapidly, often making several

hundred rotations per second. Many neutron stars form radio pulsars, emitting radio waves

that appear from the Earth to pulse on and oﬀ like a lighthouse beacon as the star rotates

at very high speeds. Depending on star mass and rotational frequency, gravity compresses

the matter in the core regions of pulsars up to more than ten times the density of ordinary

atomic nuclei, thus providing a high pressure environment in which numerous subatomic

particle processes compete with each other.

The most spectacular ones stretch from the generation of hyperons and baryon resonances to

quark deconﬁnement to the formation of boson condensates. There are theoretical sugges-

tions of even more exotic processes inside neutron stars, such as the formation of absolutely

stable strange quark matter, a conﬁguration of matter more stable than the most stable

2

atomic nucleus, 62Ni. Instead these objects should be named nucleon stars, since relatively
isospin symmetric nuclear matter-in equilibrium with condensed K − mesons-may prevail

in their interiors [3], hyperon stars if hyperons (Σ,Λ,Ξ, possibly in equilibrium with the ∆

resonance) become populated in addition to the nucleons, quark hybrid stars if the highly

compressed matter in the centers of neutron stars were to transform into u, d, s quark mat-

ter, or strange stars if strange quark matter were to be more stable than nuclear matter. Of

course, at present one does not know from experiment at what density the expected phase

transition to quark matter occurs. Neither do lattice Quantum ChromoDynamical (QCD)

simulations provide a conclusive guide yet. From simple geometrical considerations it follows

that, for a characteristic nucleon radius of rN
N /3))−1

1fm, nuclei begin to touch each other at
0.24 fm3, which is less than twice the baryon number density of
densities of
ordinary nuclear matter, ρ0 = 0.16 fm3 (energy density ǫ0 = 140 MeV/fm3). Depending on

(4πr3

≈

∼

the rotational frequency and stellar mass, such densities are easily surpassed in the cores of

neutron stars so gravity may have broken up the neutrons (n) and protons (p) in the centers

of neutron stars into their constituents. The phase diagram of quark matter, expected to be

in a color superconducting phase, is very complex [3-5]. At asymptotic densities the ground

state of QCD with a vanishing strange quark mass is the color-ﬂavor locked (CFL) phase.

This phase is electrically charge neutral without any need for electrons for a signiﬁcant range

of chemical potentials and strange quark masses.

Quite recently McLaughlin et al. [6] searched for radio sources that vary on much shorter

timescales. They found eleven objects characterized by single, dispersed bursts having du-

rations between 2 and 30 ms. The average time intervals between bursts range from 4 min

to 3 h with radio emission typically detectable for < 1 s per day. From an analysis of the

burst arrival times, they have identiﬁed periodicities in the range 0.4-7 s for ten of the eleven

sources, suggesting origins in rotating neutron stars. Meanwhile as all pulsars from which

giant pulses have been detected appear to have high values of magnetic ﬁeld strength at

their light cylinder radii [7]. While the Crab pulsar has a magnetic ﬁeld strength at the
105 G [6], this value ranges from only 3 to 30G for these sources,

light cylinder of 9.3

suggesting that the bursts originate from a diﬀerent emission mechanism. They therefore

concluded that these sources represent a previously unknown population of bursting neutron

stars, which they call rotating radio transients (RRATs). These interesting new observa-

tions make us to investigate the rotation (e.g., it is still controversial how much angular

3

momentum the iron cores have before the onset of the gravitational-collapse) [1,6] as well

as Pauli-blocking eﬀects [8] in compact stars considering the phase diagram [4].

In present approach the Uehling-Uhlenbeck collision term [9-10] which could describe the

collision of a gas of dilute hard-sphere Fermi- or Bose-particles by tuning a parameter γ :

a Pauli-blocking factor (or γf with f being a normalized (continuous) distribution function

giving the number of particles per cell) is adopted together with a free-orientation θ (which

is related to the relative direction of scattering of particles w.r.t. to the normal of the prop-

agating plane-wave front) into the quantum discrete kinetic model [10] which can be used

to obtain dispersion relations of plane (sound) waves propagating in diﬀerent-statistic gases

(of particles). We then study the critical behavior based on the acoustical analog [11-12]

which has been veriﬁed before. The possible phase diagram (as the orientation is changed)

we obtained resemble qualitatively those proposed before [4].

Since passage of the plane (sound wave) will cause a small departure from an equilibrium

state and result in energy loss owing to internal friction and heat conduction, we linearize

above equations around a uniform equilibrium state (particles’ number density : N0) by

setting Ni(t, x) =N0 (1 + Pi(t, x)), where Pi is a small perturbation. After some similar

manipulations (please refer to Chu in [12-13]), with B = γN0 < 0, which gives or deﬁnes

the (proportional) contribution from the Fermi gases (if γ < 0, e.g., γ =

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We ﬁrstly introduce the concept of acoustical analog [11-12] in brief. In a mesoscopic

system, where the sample size is smaller than the mean free path for an elastic scattering, it

is satisfactory for a one-electron model to solve the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation

:

where q is an (energy) eigenvalue parameter, which for the quantum-mechanic system is
q2mE/¯h2. Meanwhile, the equation for classical (scalar) waves is
(∂2ψ/c2 ∂t2) = 0
or (after applying a Fourier transform in time and contriving a system where c (the wave

speed) varies with position ~r)

V (~r)]ψ = 0, here, the eigenvalue parameter q is

2ψ + [q2

∇

−

ω/c0, where ω is a natural frequency and c0 is a reference wave speed. Comparing the time

dependencies one gets the quantum and classical relation E = ¯hω. The localized state could

thus be determined via E or the rarefaction parameter (h) which is related to the ratio of

the collision frequency and the wave frequency [11-12].

The complex spectra (λ = λr+ i λi; the real part λr = krc/(√2ω): sound dispersion,

a relative measure of the sound or phase speed; the imaginary part λi = kic/(√2ω) :

sound attenuation or absorption) could be obtained from the complex polynomial equation

above. Here, the Pauli-blocking parameter (B) could be related to the occupation number

of diﬀerent-statistic particles of gases [10]. To examine the critical region possibly tuned by

the Pauli-blocking measure B = γN0 and the free orientation θ, as evidenced from previous

Boltzmann results [12] : λi = 0 for cases of θ = π/4 (or B =

1), we ﬁrstly check those

spectra near θ = 0, say, θ = 0.005 and θ = π/4

0.7854, say, θ = 0.78535 for a B-sweep

−

≈

(B decreases from 1 to -1), respectively. Note that, as the free-orientation θ is not zero,

there will be two kinds of propagation of the disturbance wave : sound and diﬀusion modes

[13-14]. The latter (anomalous) mode has been reported in Boltzmann gases (cf. Ref. 12 by

Chu) and is related to the propagation of entropy wave which is not used in the acoustical

analog here. The absence of (further) diﬀusion (or maximum absorption) for the sound

mode at certain state (h, corresponding to the inverse of energy E; cf. Chu in Ref. 12) is

classiﬁed as a localized state (resonance occurs) based on the acoustical analog [12]. The

state of decreasing h might, in one case [15], correspond to that of T (absolute temperature)

decreasing as the mean free path is increasing (density or pressure decreasing).

We have observed the max. λi (absorption of sound mode, relevant to the localization

6

length according to the acoustical analog [12]) drop to around four orders of magnitude

from θ = 0.005 to 0.78535 (please see Chu (2001) in [12])! This is a clear demonstration

of the eﬀect of free orientations. Meanwhile, once the Pauli-blocking measure (B) increases

or decreases from zero (Boltzmann gases), the latter (Fermi gases : B < 0) shows opposite

trend compared to that of the former (Bose gases : B > 0) considering the shift of the max.

λi state : δh. δh > 0 is for Fermi gases (

increasing), and the reverse (δh < 0) is for Bose

gases (B increasing)! This illustrates partly the interaction eﬀect (through the Pauli exclu-

sion principle). These results will be crucial for further obtaining the phase diagram (as the

density or temperature is changed) tuned by both the free orientation and the interaction.

Here, B =

1 or θ = 0, π/4 might be ﬁxed points.

−

To check what happens when the temperature is decreased (or h is decreased) to near T = 0

or T = Tc, we collect all the data based on the acoustical analog from the dispersion relations

(especially the absorption of sound mode) we calculated for ranges in diﬀerent degrees of the

orientation (here, θ is up to π/4 considering single-particle scattering and binary collisions;

in fact, eﬀects of θ are symmetric w.r.t. θ = π/4 for 0

and Pauli-blocking measure. After that, we plot the possible phase diagram for the inverse

of the rarefaction parameter vs. the orientation (which is related to the scattering) into Fig.

1 (for diﬀerent Bs : B =

temperature vs. MFP relations could be, ine one case, traced from Ref. 15 (following Fig.

3 therein). This ﬁgure shows that as the temperature decreases to a rather low value, the

orientation will decrease sharply (at least for either Bose or Fermi gases). There is no doubt

that this result resembles qualitatively that proposed before [16] for cases of the pressure vs.

temperature analogue.

On the other hand, qualitatively similar results (cf. Fig. 4 in [17] : theirin higher relative

pressure corresponding to λr here) show that (i) once the orientation θ increases, for the same

h (or temperature [15]), the dispersion λr (or the relative pressure [17]) increases (please

refer to Chu (2001) in [12]); (ii) as

B

(B: the Pauli-blocking parameter) increases, the dis-

|

|

persion (λr) will reach the continuum or hydrodynamical limit (larger h or high temperature

regime) earlier. The phase speed of the plane (sound) wave in Bose gases (even for small

but ﬁxed h) increases more rapid than that of Fermi gases (w.r.t. to the higher temperature

conditions : larger h) as the relevant parameter B increases. For all the rarefaction measure

7

(h), perturbed plane waves propagate faster in Bose-particle gases than Boltzmann-particle

and Fermi-particle gases (e.g., see [18] or [13]). In fact, the real part (λr) also resembles

qualitatively those reported in [19] for T > Tc cases.

As for the imaginary part (λi), there is the maximum absorption (or attenuation) for certain

h (the rarefaction parameter) which resembles that reported in [20] (cf. Fig. 1 (b) therein).

We observed a jump of the (relative) sound speed in the multiple scattering case (cf. Chu

(2002) in [12]) which was also reported in [21](at the phase transition between hadronic

phase and QGP).

To know the detailed eﬀects of interactions (tuned by the Pauli-blocking parameter : B here)

and the orientation, which could be linked to the eﬀective number of thermodynamic degrees

of freedom (as stated in [22] : ν, for an ideal gas of massless, non-interacting constituents,

ν counts the number of bosonic degrees of freedom plus the number of fermionic degrees

of freedom weighted by 7/8), we plot θ (of which the localization or resonance occurs for

speciﬁc B) vs. µ (the chemical potential, in arbitrary units) in Figs. 2 and 3 by referring

to two possibly localized states (θ = 0 or π/4; cf. Chu (2001) in [12]). The trends here

resemble that of Fig. 1 in [16]. The density rises from the onset of nuclear matter through

the transition to quark matter as illustrated in Fig. 2 (cf. the left branch of Fig. 1 in [16] by

Alford). The compact star is possibly in this region of the phase diagram. Then there might

be diﬀerent behaviors separated by crossover regions as shown in Figs. 2 (θ = 0 dominated,

T (the temperature)

h (the rarefaction measure)) and 3 (θ = π/4 dominated, T (the

∝

∝

temperature)

1/h). We remind the readers that for the case of θ = π/4 dominated (Fig.

3), as the lower temperature is associated with the higher density, fermions (B < 0) link to

the lower temperature regime (under the same orientation).

If there are diﬀerences between ours and those reported before (presumed that the mat-

ter under study is in (approximate) local thermal equilibrium. At RHIC, such evidence is

believed to be provided by the agreement of the elliptic ﬂow [23] measured in noncentral col-

lisions with hydrodynamic model predictions. Such predictions are based on the assumption

that the matter behaves like a ﬂuid in local thermal equilibrium, with arbitrarily short mean

free paths and correspondingly strong interactions), one possible explanation could be that

the assumption of a completely thermal medium is a simpliﬁcation [24]. The acoustic per-

turbations we treated are close to the thermodynamic equilibrium (for Bose or Fermi gases).

Other reasoning is related to the diﬀerent types of particles (with or without fragmentation)

8

being considered. One interesting observation is that the attenuation of jet (quenching)

observed at RHIC resembles qualitatively the attenuation of plane (sound) waves (cf. Chu

in [12]).

With above results, then our approach could provide an eﬀective theory based on the op-

posite picture of very strong interaction (via the tuning of B and θ) and very small mean

free paths (h is large) [24]. This can also be useful to the study of problems in astrophysics

: like compact stars. For instance, one of the most striking features of QCD is asymptotic

freedom: the force between quarks becomes arbitrarily weak as the characteristic momentum

scale of their interaction grows larger. This immediately suggests that at suﬃciently high

densities and low temperatures (corresponding to the case of Fig. 3 here; cf. Chu (2001) in

[12] since θ = π/4 is also possible and thus dominates the localized behavior or transition)

matter will consist of a Fermi sea of essentially free quarks, whose behavior is dominated by

the freest of them all: the high-momentum quarks that live at the Fermi surface.

To conclude in brief, our illustrations here, although are based on the acoustical analog of

our quantum discrete kinetic calculations, can indeed show the Fermi and Bose liquid (say,

Cooper pairs) and their critical behavior for the transition (at least valid to the regime

T > Tc considering the QGP) once the orientation is tuned as well as the temperature is

decreased signiﬁcantly. We shall investigate more complicated problems in the future [25-27]

(e.g., the saturated orientation shown in Fig. 3 which is almost the same for all diﬀerent-

statistic gases of particles might be relevant to the Stefan-Boltzmann limit; cf. Fig. 5 in

[26] by Rischke).

Abstract

From the curved spacetime Lagrangian the ﬁrst approximation scalar particle

quantum equation was obtained following the canonical formalism. Then

the roots of this equation in Schwarzschild’s pseudo ﬂat space were found.

As it was shown in a more general curved spacetime it is tedious to ﬁnd

equation’s roots. The massless particle limiting case was considered. The

Maxwell set of equations generalized to Schwarzschild’s space was reproduced.

The generalized charge concept was presented. The concept was connected

with the present approach. On the basis of the concept the elementary particle

Schwarzschild radii were calculated. PACS 101110Ef

I. INTRODUCTION

One of the widely accepted approaches to the quantum gravity subject are the quantum

ﬁelds in curved spacetime. The subject of quantum ﬁelds in curved spacetime as an step

toward the ﬁnal quantum gravity theory was repeatedly covered in many papers and else-

where [1]. The quantization of the gravitational ﬁeld was considered in many attempts in

the past few decades but a completely satisfactory quantum theory of gravity remains un-

reachable. Besides the subject of quantum ﬁelds in curved spacetime one of these attempts

1

is the the supergravity theory based on the supersymmetry [2] as the most accepted and

signiﬁcant ones. In the quantum ﬁelds in curved spacetime approach the gravitational ﬁeld

is considered as a background ﬁeld while the matter ﬁelds are quantized in the usual way.

This approach consists of the subject of the quantum ﬁeld theory in a curved background by

taking the general theory of relativity as a description of the gravity. The essential part of

the quantum ﬁelds in curved spacetime approximation is the Minkowskian space quantum

ﬁeld theory [4]. In the quantum ﬁelds in curved spacetime approach the Lagrange function

of a quantum ﬁeld in the curved spacetime was carried over from the corresponding function

in Minkowskian space. The Lagrange functions of a quantum ﬁeld was usually clasiﬁed

according to the constitutive ﬁeld transformation properties under the inﬁnitesimal Lorentz

transformations. From the Lagrangian densities of the scalar, spinor or the electromagnetic

ﬁelds in the Minkowski space the corresponding action in curved spacetime was obtained.

The quantum ﬁeld equation was obtained by setting the variation of the action with respect

to the corresponding ﬁeld equal to zero.

The curved spacetime Lagrangian with its quantum equations subject is opposed to the

quantum ﬁelds in curved spacetime approach. On the contrary to the above concept in the

present issue the Lagrange function is completely diﬀerent from the usual one. The Lagrange

function is introduced as it is formulated classicaly instead of the quantum mechanicaly.

Such function contains no usual ﬁelds or their ﬁrst derivatives but on the contrast it has a

geometrical structure. Moreover the function is not obtained from the corresponding func-

tion in the Minkowski space but it is formulated from the beginning in a curved spacetime.

The essential part in the present approach is the classical geometrical curved spacetime La-

grange function. The quantization of the classical Lagrange function formulated in a curved

spacetime proceeds through the canonical formalism. This procedure closely follows that

one formulated in Minkowskian spacetime. In the continuation the procedure will be brieﬂy

outlined. The classical Lagrange function in the ﬂat spacetime is

L(x, ˙x) = Z λ(x, ˙x)d3x.

The Lagrange equations of the motion are obtained by demanding that the corresponding

action δR L(x, ˙x)dt = 0 is stationary

Historically ﬁrst such example was obtained when Schr¨odinger wrote its famous equation

i¯h ∂ψ

∂t = − ¯h2

2m

∂ψ
∂x by replacing the momentum p = m ˙x with the quantum momentum operator

in the classical non relativistic Hamilton function H = p2

2m . According to the canonical

formalism that function corresponds to the Lagrange function L = m( ˙x)2

2

.

Through the canonical procedure with the geometrical Lagrange function features char-

acteristic of quantum mechanics can be derived. One of the most important characteristic is

the quantum equation of the corresponding particle. The next geometrical quantity besides

the Lagrange function is its Hamiltonian. The quantum equation is obtained by imposing a

condition on this function.

We see that the diﬀerencies between these two approaches are considerable. We should

expect that the diﬀerencies are even more pronounced by considering the ﬁnal results. How-

ever that was not the case. In spite of such considerable initial diﬀerencies the ﬁnal appear-

ance of both approaches shows no signiﬁcant discrepancies. It was shown by the results that

the physical reality was quite similar in both cases.

Another quantization technique is the path integral quantization. Although it will not

be considered here we note the fundamental role that the Lagrange function has in it. There

3

by the action as the generating function of a canonical transformation the system variables

are transformed from one time to another. Moreover the generating functional in which the

most important part is the Lagrange function together with the arbitrary potential function

(extended by the source therm containing the current) is used to calculate Green’s functions.

The particular curved space where the Lagrangian function was established is not yet se-

lected. In Sec.2. the canonical procedure with the Schwarzschild Lagrangian was presented.

Here the Schwarzschild metric space was selected because of the one of its fundamental prop-

erties. The fundamental property of such metric is the absence of the oﬀ diagonal elements

g0i in the metric tensor gµν. This metric corresponds to a pseudo ﬂat curved spacetime.

Moreover the Schwarzschild metric is one of the best investigated time independent, spher-

ically symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations in an empty space [3]. The canonical

procedure with the Lagrangian function in this spacetime results in a scalar ﬁeld quantum

equation. By the above property of the metric tensor it was possible to ﬁnd the roots of the

general quadratic quantum equation for the scalar ﬁeld. Furthermore the results of Section

were extended to the more general metric. The ﬂat space limiting case was discussed. At

the end of Section the more general example with nonzero oﬀ diagonal metric tensor element

was given. This is the Kerr metric example. In the most general case with the nonzero oﬀ

diagonal elements it is tedious if at all possible analiticaly to ﬁnd the roots as was shown in

Sec.3. Furthermore in that Section in the special case when the discriminant of the general

equation is zero the solution with the vanishing oﬀ diagonal elements was obtained in agree-

ment with the results in Sec.2. In Sec.4 the calculations in the massless particle limiting

case will be done. Anlogously with Sec.2. results the quadratic equation and its roots were

found. Then it was shown that the calculation of the root equation leads us to the well

known Maxwell set of equations generalized to the curved Schwarzschild space. In Sec.5.

some speculations about the generalized charge hypothesis will be presented. In accordance

with the hypothesis the Schwarzschild radii of the particle will be estimated.

II. CANONICAL PROCEDURE WITH THE SCHWARZSCHILD LAGRANGIAN

Schwarzschild’s empty space is deﬁned by the expression

ds2 = eν(r)(cdt)2 − eλ(r)(dr)2 − r2[(dθ)2 + sin2θ(dφ)2]

(6)

The unknown functions ν(r) and the λ(r) are obtained from the empty space Einstein

equation. According to this equation the condition is imposed on Ricci’s tensor

Rαβ = {

The solution of the equation reads

eν(r) = e−λ(r) = 1 −

2m
r

.

(7)

(9)

From the eq.(6) and the eq.(9) the velocity square in the Schwarzschild space was obtained

˙s2 = (1 −

)(c ˙t)2 − (

1

1 − 2m

r

)( ˙r)2 − r2[( ˙θ2 + sin2 θ( ˙φ)2].

(10)

The quantization was proceeded according to canonical formalism. First the Lagrange func-

tion was found. It was guessed on the basis of the classical arguments that the Lagrange

function is proportional to the velocity square in Schwarzschild’s space

L(x, ˙x) =

M
4

˙s2.

By substituting from the eq.(10) into the eq.(11) Lagrange’s function was obtained

L(x, ˙x) =

(11)

(12)

In the Schwarzschild spacetime the four coordinate was consisted of its contravariant and

covariant components. These components are not equal and were denoted as

xα = (ct, r, θ, φ), xα =

(13)

The contravariant momentum components pµ conjugated to the contravariant coordinate xµ

were calculated by combining the expression (2) with the eq.(12)

p0 =

These components together with the covariant momentum components in the Schwarzschild

(18)

The contravariant momentum components were connected with the covariant components

through the metric tensors

(19)

All together was collected

H(x, p) = pα( ˙x)α − L(x, ˙x) = L(x, ˙x)

(20)

so the Hamilton and the Lagrange functions in the Shwarzschild spacetime are equal. Here

the equations (2),(12),(13) and (18) were put together. The velocity components from

(10)were substituted by the corresponding momentum components from the equation (18)

into the eq.(20). The Hamilton function in Schwarzschild’s spacetime reads

In the ﬁrst approximation for a gravitational ﬁeld the energy of a scalar particle has a

constant value. This value does not depend on any of the four component coordinate value

as it is for example the particle space position. In this approximation it is favourable to

choose the constant value equal to the energy of the scalar particle H = M c2. To the contrary

if the coupling between a scalar or a spinor ﬁeld and the gravitational ﬁeld is not negligeable

the particle energy generally depends on the coordinate x. In that case the function has

been usually chosen as the Ricci scalar curvature R(x) and we have H = M c2 + ξR(x).

From now on we shall take the ﬁrst approximation case.

In that approximation the

description of a scalar particle in the gravitational space proceeds by equating the energy of

the particle to its Hamilton’s function. From the eq.(21) the expression

By substituting pα → i¯h∂α for the four-momentum and denoting by ψ(x) the quantum wave

(28)

Far away from the Schwarzschild’s ﬁeld we are in the r → ∞ limit. In that limiting case
the space should become the ﬂat one. By taking that r → ∞ in eq. (24) and eq.(27) it was
found

¯h2(

respectively. The above expressions should be compared with the ﬂat spacetime quantum

equations. The ﬂat spacetime is charactrized by the Minkowski metric tensor

(32)

(33)

and the special relativity energy expression is obtained. Finally the familiar equations

emerge

(¯h2∂µ∂µ + M 2c2)φ(x) = 0.

(i¯hγµ∂µ − M c)ψ(x) = 0.

(34)

(35)

The equation (29) and the eq.(30) are the same as the eq.(34) and the eq.(35) respectively

in our case with two variables.

In this case the equations have one space and one time

component. It follows that the quantum equations have the correct behaviour in ﬂat space

limiting case.

Here we note that the same letter M was used for the Schwarzschild Lagrangian mass

parameter as for the energy parameter. Each of this parameters enters the equation (27),

ﬁrst one through the Lagrange function (12) and second one through total energy expression

(22). Generally, these two parametars are not necessary equal. In such case if we denote

the diﬀerent values of the above parameters by M and M ′ the expression M in the eq.(27)
should be replaced with the expression √M M ′ so that this equation in the more general

case reads

(i¯hoα∂α −

√M M ′c)ψ(x) = 0.

(36)

In the Schwarzschild case the oﬀ diagonal components of the metric tensor were equal

to zero. At the end of this section let us consider the quantum equation analogous to the

eq.(24) but this time in Kerr’s spacetime where the oﬀ diagonal components of the metric

tensor do not vanish.

We see an extra term g03 breaking the metric tensor symmetry. In this case it is tedious to

ﬁnd the roots of the quantum equation.

III. SCHWARZSCHILD’S LIMIT OF THE EQUATION IN THE GENERAL

CURVED SPACETIME

The Kerr metric is an example of a general curved spacetime.

In a general curved

spacetime the oﬀ diagonal elements of metric tensor do not vanish. In this Section the most

general metric was used to form an equation analogous to the eq.(24). Such metric was given

by the symmetric form gµν = gνµ so the metric tensor has ten independent components. The

metric tensor of the general curved spacetime reads

gαβ =

The corresponding equation reads

g00 g01 g02 g03

g11 g12 g13

g22 g23

g33





.





(38)

g00(p0)2 + g01p0p1 + g02p0p2 + g03p0p3 + g11(p1)2 + g12p1p2 + g13p1p3 + g22(p2)2 +

g23p2p3 + g33(p3)2 − M 2c2 = 0.

(39)

In order to ﬁnd out a special form of the equation (39) the labels were introduced

C = (p1)2g11 + p1p2g12 + p1p3g13 + (p2)2g22 + p2p3g23 + (p3)2g33 − M 2c2

A = g00, B = p1g01 + p2g02 + p3g03

10

(40)

so the equation was rewritten in the form of the quadratic algebaric equation. The variable

of the equation was the energy

A(p0)2 + B(p0) + C = 0.

There were two solutions of the quadratic equation (41)

(p0)1,2 = −B ± √B2 − 4AC

2A

.

The analytical solutions were depended on the discriminant of the equation (42)

B2 − 4AC = (p1)2(g2

p2p3(2g02g03 − 4g00g23) + (p3)2(g2

+p1p3(2g01g03 − 4g00g13) + (p2)2(g2

01 − 4g00g11) + p1p2(2g01g02 − g00g12) +
02 − 4g00g22) +
03 − 4g00g33) + 4g00M 2c2.

(41)

(42)

(43)

In the general case when the metric tensor oﬀ-diagonal components were diﬀerent from zero

it is diﬃcult or even impossible to calculate analitically the roots of expression (43).

Let us now discuss the opposite case as it has been done in Sec.2. If the oﬀ diagonal

components of the metric tensor (38) vanish then the coeﬃcients in the equation (40) become

A = g00, B = 0, C = (p1)2g11 + (p2)2g22 + (p3)2g33 − M 2c2.

(44)

Having substituted (44)into the eq.(42) for this particular case the analytical solutions read

(p0)1,2 = ±s−

C
A

.

The eq.(44) and the eq.(45) were combined together with the result

√g00(p0)1,2 = ±qM 2c2 − g11(p1)2 − g22(p2)2 − g33(p3)2.

The root was found at the usual way and thus we arrive at the expression

√g00p0 = α1√g11p1 + α2√g22p2 + α3√g33p3 + βM c

By using the labels

11

(45)

(46)

(47)

oα = (

,

γi
√gii

)

(48)

the eq.(27)was recalculated. By comparison of the expressions (28),(48) with the expression

(19) we conclude that the Schwarzschild curved spacetime equation was obtained.

This Section was concluded by examination of the transformation properties of the so-

lution ψ(x) under the proper Lorentz transformations in Schwarzschild’s space. This trans-

formation was denoted

x′α = Ωα

β xβ, ∂′α = Ωα

β ∂β, ψ′(x′) = S(Ω)ψ(x).

(49)

The transformation property of the Schwarzschild operator (28) was straightforwardly cal-

culated by using the eq.(49)

gαβS−1(Ω)oβS(Ω) = Ωαγoγ.

The S(Ω) matrix depends on the o commutator

S(Ω) = e− φ

4 [oα,oβ].

(50)

(51)

where it was supposed that Dirac’s matrices satisfy the usual commutation relations. Then

the o commutation relations read

[o0, o1] = [γ0, γ1], [o0, o2] 6= [γ0, γ2], [o0, o3] 6= [γ0, γ3].

(52)

IV. THE MASSLESS PARTICLE LIMIT OF THE SCHWARZSCHILD

QUANTUM EQUATIONS

A massless particle in the Schwarzschild spacetime was discussed. A massless particle

follows the geodetic lines of curved spacetime. The arch length of such particle is equal to

zero and consequently its Lagrange’s function vanishes

L(x, ˙x) = 0.

12

(53)

The equations of motion should have the same form regardless of the particular reference

system where there is an observer. So we were permitted to choose such reference system

in which the zero component of the electromagnetic potential is equal to zero. By such

choice the dynamic case was selected. Consequently there were no static electric ﬁelds in

the observer frame of reference. Although the mathematical description was considerably

simpliﬁed by such choice the physical reality remains untouched. Furthermore as it will be

shown in the continuation this choice corresponds to the Coulomb gauge. Under the above

assumptions the quadratic quantum equation (24) was further simpliﬁed

gαβpαpβA(x) = 0, Aα = (0, Ai) ≡ (0, ~A).

(54)

The solutions in the Schwarzschild empty space were considered. In that spacetime eq.(54)

reads

(57)

(58)

where the identity (56) was used. This equation was corresponded in the massless case to

the quadratic equation (24). In the continuation we proceed in the same way as in Sec.2.

First the roots of the quadratic equation were found. From the eq. (57) and the eq.(54) the

ﬁrst root of the eq.(58) was obtained

13

P S
α Aβ(x) = P S

β Aα(x) = 0.

(59)

The ﬁrst root equation was put in the more convenient form by calculating the bilinear

This expression was corresponded to the generalization of the square of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld tensor Fµν in Schwarzschild’s space. By eliminating the vanishing components in the

expression (60) the bilinear form was simpliﬁed

the familiar relation between the Hamiltonian and the ﬁeld momentum in the dynamic case

was obtained. In this case only the radiation was considered. At this point let us look back at

Sec.2 basic assumptions. The fundamental quantity from which the Lagrange function of the

particle was found is the particle four velocity. That quantity depends on the given curved

spacetime and by knowing it we were able to obtain the scalar and the spinor quantum

equations for that space. By further specialization to the massless case the Lagrangian and

the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the given spacetime have been calculated.

In the following the Maxwell set of equations in the Schwarzschild space will be obtained.

This shows that the equations are directly connected with the curvature of the spacetime

through a fundamental quantity. This is the given spacetime four velocity. The electric ﬁeld

V. THE GENERALIZED CHARGE HYPOTHESIS SPECULATIONS.

ELEMENTARY PARTICLE SCHWARZSCHILD’S RADII.

The curved spacetime Lagrangian with its quantum equations subject was orginated

from the generalized charge concept [5]. By the generalized charge concept the Einstein

principle of equivalence about the equivalence of the inertial and the body heavy mass was

generalized. The equivalence was established between the body electric charge and its mass.

That equvalence takes place at the microscopic scale but as well should be extended to the

16

macroscopic bodies. On the microscopic scale the generalized equvalence principle is best

expressed through the speciﬁc electron charge relation (MKS)

e = 1.8 × 1011me

(77)

where the e and me denote the electron electric charge and the mass respectively. On the

other side the well known Einstein relation states

E = mec2.

By combining these two equations we arrive at the relation

E = mec2 =

ec2

1.8 × 1011

(78)

(79)

where the microscopic contents of the generalized charge principle was expressed. On the

macroscopic scale it is expected that the electric charge of a body should curve the spacetime

in which it is embodied in complete analogy with the body mass in general theory of rela-

tivity. Thus the light ray should be curved in the presence of strong electric charge. On the

contrary to the mass situation that phenomenon is more intensive here. As an illustration

we note that on the microscopic scale the ratio of these two forces was equal to

Fel
Fgr

= 2.4 × 1039.

(80)

For a natural system of units instead of the MKS, in which the general charge has the unique

value m = e the above ratio was still enormous

Fel
Fgr

= 1020.

(81)

Unlike the general relativity case the repulsive force was predicted together with the attrac-

tive one. If the charge sign is reversed the Doppler shift moves from the red to the blue

values.

The generalized charge principle has as the extension an interesting elementary particle

concept. The concept was based upon a model of an elementary particle as a distortion of

17

spacetime. Such distortion was produced by the phenomenon of the mass or the electric

charge localization.

In this concept a particle and the four dimensional spacetime were

inseparable. As the localization of the spacetime the elementary particle and the curved

spacetime are unique concept. The space around us is mostly the ﬂat spacetime because we

are often very far from particle. This is obvious in the macroscopic scale. On the microscopic

scale far away from a particle the spacetime is nearly ﬂat and asymptoticaly Minkowskian.

Such space corresponds to the absence of the particle. On the contrary the particle is present

in the opposite case where we are near it. In the continuation one of the criteria for the

presence of a particle shall be estimated. This approximate estimation was based on the

generalized charge concept in Schwarzschild’s curved spacetime. Near the Schwarzschild

radius, the opposite limit from that of the ﬂat spacetime emerges. For an electron, the

geometric mass coincides exactly with the Planck mass

mg(Sch) =

GM

c2 = 6.7 × 10−58

(82)

The gravitational Schwarzschild radius is far inside the electron radii. Here it was supposed

that Schwarzschild’s radius has more general signiﬁcance by introducing the generalized

charge concept. If the electric charge instead of the mass was considered

me(Sch) =

ke

c2 = 1.6 × 10−26m.

(83)

When we are inside the 10−26 radius close to the electron we see it as a (rotating) blackhole

in the spacetime because of its electric charge. The same was true for the neutron if we are

much closer to it as estimated in eq.(82). Following the same argument it was concluded

that for the strong interaction the Schwarzschild radius is even much larger than the electric

(or the gravitational) one. The Schwarzschild radius value is approximately close to the

size of the proton (10−15m) in which case the proton should be seen as a blackhole because

of its colour charge. On the contrary to the electric charge case the strong charge cannot

be isolated. Consequently this is a shortrange interaction case. The proton as a blackhole

remains stable and indivisible.

18

The model of an elementary particle as a distorsion of spacetime lead us to the geo-

metrical Lagrangian concept (12). Moreover to the particular curved spacetime the corre-

sponding Lagrange function is joined. Through the canonical formalism the equation which

corresponds to the Lagrange function is obtained (24,27). This is the elementary particle

equation. In the limit r → ∞ the elementary particle as a distorsion of spacetime becomes
a ﬂat spacetime. In the opposite case the corresponding diﬀerential equation (39) solutions

represent the elementary particle wave functions.

At the end the fundamental and direct consequence of the generalized charge concept as

it is the existence of an interaction between the mass and the electric charge was dicussed.

Such interaction was allowed to be the repulsive as well as the attractive one. The interaction

was presently considered as the weaker than the electric one. Furthermore, the interaction

between the mass and the negative electric charge was considered as repulsive while the

interaction between the positron and the mass is to the contrary the attractive one. If so,

the most stable particle states in the universe should be obtained as a massive positive

particle (the proton) together with the very light negative charged particle (the electron).

This corresponds to the hydrogen atom case.

Abstract

N = 2 gauged non-linear sigma models are examined classically and their D-terms
are solved. The variation of the classical Lagrangian in order to solve for the auxiliary
ﬁelds is identical to integrating these modes functionally. The latter is performed for
the general quotient. The D-term solution is equivalent to solving, a coupled set of
algebraic equations.

Introduction

The solution to the D-terms in N = 2 non-linear sigma models is useful in the
construction of metrics on toric varieties as well as in the construction of particle
physics and string models. Their solution is problematic because a very general set
of algebraic equations has to be solved.

The K¨ahler metrics are also required in order to generate geodesic ﬂows on these
spaces. The solutions to these ﬂow equations are required in order to ﬁnd solutions
to algebraic systems [1] and systems of non-linear diﬀerential equations [2].

The solution to these D-term equations can be achieved by a counting of tree di-
agrams in scalar ﬁeld theory models [3]. The scalar ﬁeld model contains interactions
of an arbitrary degree in the external lines, due to the exponential interactions in the
auxiliary ﬁelds. The counting can be performed in principle by a careful examination
of the auxiliary ﬁeld interactions and is torically model speciﬁc. However, a deforma-
tion can be added to the Lagrangian which simpliﬁes this count quite much; after the
solution to the D-terms, the deformation parameters are taken to zero. (The same
tree graphs are used in the full quantization of scalar ﬁeld and gauge theories [4]-[8].

The general auxiliary components of the N = 2 Lagrangian is described by (see

for example [9] also for several completed examples),

with an implicit sum on the auxiliary components Vj in the exponential. The ﬁeld
equations that are derived from (1) are the set,

In some cases of these torics, ﬁeld redeﬁnitions may be used to ﬁnd the K¨ahler po-
tential; the general case and its algebraic system requires a diﬀerent approach.

Solution

As opposed to solving a complicated system of algebraic equations, the La-
grangian and its integration over the auxiliary ﬁelds Vj can be analyzed with the
use of classical scattering diagrams which have no momentum structure. There is
no propagator or derivatives on the auxiliary ﬁelds, and as such, the integration of

2

these ﬁelds is obtained by counting all of the inequivalent tree diagrams that contain
external (φi, ¯φi) lines and internal Vj lines.

The linear dependence on the Vj ﬁeld, as well as a non-trivial but required com-

binatoric property, is treated by changing its form as in,

γ = X rjγjαj

A ﬁeld redeﬁnition of Vj → (Vj − αj)/rjγj changes the deformation into

j=1

rjVj → X

ViVj .

The limit of the linear term is obtained by taking γjαjrj = 1 with rjγj = 0, for
example; another removal of the deformation can be obtained by ﬁeld redeﬁning
φi → φiriγi followed by taking γi to zero. The latter is due to the counting of internal
lines in the diagrams; due to the vertex structure there are always n propagators with
a diagram containing n + 2 φi or ¯φi lines.

This deformation in (4) generates a uniformity to the combinatorics associated
with the interacting auxiliary ﬁelds in the tree diagrams, as the propagator is com-
pletely symmetric in the indices j and k. As a result, the vertices are connected from
one node to eachother in the most uniform manner possible; this eﬀectively changes
all of the Vj into V in the classical graphs so that only a single scalar ﬁeld need be
examined (while keeping the indices on the charges). The removal of the deforma-
tion is obtained in the K¨ahler potential K(φi, ¯φi), after its form is deduced from the
classical scattering.

The complings in the Lagrangian (1) are deduced by expanding the exponentials
in the Vj ﬁelds. Each graph composed of the various i vertices containing pi lines
(two of which are external φ ﬁelds) are weighted with these couplings. The K¨ahler
potential is found from,

The counting number an,m is used to count the number of diagrams containing the
sum P pi = m and at nφ-point. This counting function can be obtained by solving
an associated function [1]. The potential is found in a patch around φi = ¯φi = 0 and
as an expansion which is not necessarily Taylor.

These couplings are used to weight the classical graphs, and ﬁnd the K¨ahler potential.
The sum on qj extends at ﬁxed pj, with P qj = n, with the sum on n. These couplings
together with the counting function a2nφ,m are used to ﬁnd the K¨ahler potential with
(6); recall that m = P(2 + pj), that is the count of lines at each vertex.

After the computation, the deformation parameter is removed; without a ﬁeld
redeﬁnition on the φ, ¯φ coordinates, there could be a potential singularity and requires
some summations to be performed; however the scaling of the coordinates removes
this. As qi becomes large, with the large order scaling n ∼ qj, the right hand side in
(10) tends to,

This is a heuristic explanation of how the removal of deformation parameter can
be explained by performing the sum in (10), and taking γjrj → 0. The sum, and
its asymptotic values has to be examined. A ﬁeld redeﬁnition of the coordinates
can handle the removable singularity in the αj. The above is one means to remove
the deformation, but a direct scaling of the coordinates by the riγi, with the limit
riγi → 0, can also eliminate the removable singularity.

The second one is found from setting the numbers to j = 0, a = 0, b = 2 and j = 1,
a = 0, b = 1 and j = 2, a = 0, b = 0 in the formulae of (21)-(25) of [1]. This results
in (16) by changing α2 → α2 + b and ˜p → ˜p + b with the values of a.

These expansions are generally not Taylor, as the inﬁnite number of derivatives
about the origin of the K¨ahler potential might not converge. There are expansions
of xδ involving Laguerre polynomials which are polynomials in x; these derivatives
of x for small δ do not exist except by analytic continuation. This is an example of
the multiple sums might converge to radicals in the lowest order terms of the φi, ¯φi
expansion.

The sums required to describe the K¨ahler potential might possess a hidden sym-
metry leading at a simpliﬁed form. Mirror symmetry could indicate this. However,
even for low dimensional examples of torics such as simple Hirzebruch surfaces the
metric forms are somewhat complicated.

The full form of the expansion of the K¨ahler expansion about zero is akin to
solving for the roots of a coupled set of polynomials. It is interesting that the solution

5

can be expressed in closed form, as there are theorems stating under certain functional
forms that this is not possible. Performing the sums in (16) is very relevant; modular
functions at speciﬁc values could play a role in summing these partitions also with
values of n and m.

Discussion

A generating function for the toric K¨ahler potentials is given, pertaining to both
ﬁnite and inﬁnite dimensional quotients. The explicit form of the potential, and
metrics, is produced in terms of sums over rational numbers. This derivation is
equivalent to solving the D-term constraints for a generic N = 2 gauged non-linear
sigma model, which involves solving a system of speciﬁc coupled algebraic equations
following from the charges and gaugings of the model. Instead of transcendentally
solving these equations, the counting of classical scalar ﬁeld diagrams enables the
computations of the solutions.

On the mathematical side, this derivation is equivalent to solving some compli-
cated systems of algebraic equations. A closed form is given to these solutions. It
appears that a more modular construction would simplify the results.

The explicit form of the K¨ahler potentials should reveal more structure in the
duality of the string models, and quantum ﬁeld models, that give rise to these non-
linear sigma models. The speciﬁc form of the K¨ahler potential has clear applications
to particle physics models.

The explicit form of the toric metrics also leads to further information in the
construction of solutions to generic algebraic systems [10]-[14]. Possible simpliﬁcations
in the handling of transcendental informaton are evident.

In addition, the ﬁnding of integer solutions to polynomial solutions is relevant to

the solutions of statistical mechanics problems [11].

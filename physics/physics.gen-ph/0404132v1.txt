Abstract

The construction of the scalar theory based on the concept of grav-
ity as Archimedes’ thrust is brieﬂy summarized, emphasizing the two
(extreme) possibilities that result from this concept for the gravita-
tional rod contraction: it can either occur in only one direction, or be
isotropic. A modiﬁed equation for the scalar ﬁeld is stated for the new,
isotropic case. The reasons to consider this case are: i) it is almost as
natural as the other case, and ii) it should avoid the violation of the
weak equivalence principle, found for a small extended body with the
directional contraction. The dynamical equation stays unchanged.

1 Gravity as Archimedes’ thrust

A mechanism for gravity was proposed by the author, which turns out to
be quite similar to a mechanism proposed by Euler [1] to interpret Newton’s
gravity.
In both mechanisms, the elementary contituents of matter must
have a ﬁnite extension and must have all the same mass density. Gravity
may then be interpreted as Archimedes’ thrust in a ﬂuid “ether” surround-
ing any elementary contituent. In the author’s mechanism [2], the elementary
contituents themselves are seen as localized ﬂows in that very ﬂuid—this is
the “constitutive ether”, which allows one to get a picture of the creation/
annihilation/ transmutation of particles, and of the instable “resonances”,
all being observed in particle physics. Moreover, gravitation is assumed to
involve only the “smoothed-out”, macroscopic pressure force. This concept
of gravity as Archimedes’ thrust due to the macroscopic pressure in the con-
stitutive ether leads to a deﬁnite expression for the gravity acceleration:

g = −gradpe

,

ρe

(1)

where pe is the (macroscopic) “ether pressure” and ρe = ρe(pe) is the (macro-
scopic) “density” in the ether, the latter being assumed a barotropic ﬂuid.
This expression is the starting point of a theory of gravity based on just
the scalar ﬁeld pe.
It is natural to assume that Newton’s gravity, which
propagates instantaneously, should correspond to the limiting case of an in-
compressible ether (ρe = Constant). A compressible ether should then lead
to waves of the ether pressure pe, i.e. to gravitational waves.

2 Relativity, clocks and rods

Special relativity (SR), in the Lorentz-Poincar´e version, is compatible with
the ether [3]–[6]. However, in the investigated theory of gravity, the latter is
seen as a gradient of pressure and density in the universal ﬂuid, hence it is
intrinsically a result of the heterogeneity of “space” (i.e., in the language of
the theory, the heterogeneity of the pressure or equivalently of the density in
the constitutive ether)—whereas SR assumes that space is homogeneous. It
follows that SR can apply only locally in the presence of gravitation.

2

As is known to participants of this Series of meetings, the Lorentz-Poincar´e
version of SR makes all of SR result from the Lorentz rod contraction and the
Larmor clock slowing [3]–[6]—the clock slowing being in fact a consequence
of the Lorentz contraction and of the “negative” result of the Michelson-
Morley experiment [3, 7]. Now these two metrical eﬀects of Lorentz-Poincar´e
SR can be interpreted as resulting from a variation in the “apparent” ether
density; hence, in the framework of the investigated model of gravity, one is
naturally led to postulate gravitational rod contraction and clock slowing [7].
The very notion of a clock slowing and a contraction of objects implies that
there must be a reference with respect to which these eﬀects do occur, and
the simplest possibility is clearly to assume a ﬂat reference metric. Thus,
space-time is endowed with two metrics: a ﬂat “background” metric γ 0 and
a curved “physical” metric γ.

However, the rod contraction may either occur in just one direction (as is
the case for the Lorentz contraction), which must then be that of the gravity
acceleration, i.e. that of the pressure gradient—or, alternatively, the rod con-
traction may be assumed to be isotropic. (One may also invent intermediate
solutions.) In Ref. [7], and until recently [8], the author has always assumed
the ﬁrst, anisotropic possibility, for which the correspondence between met-
rical eﬀects of motion and gravitation is the closest. The second, isotropic
possibility for the gravitational rod contraction, is what Podlaha & Sj¨odin [9]
had in mind in their analysis of that correspondence—as it can be checked
in Ref. [10]. Their analysis of the correspondence has some similarity with
[7], but it diﬀers from the latter even apart from
the one proposed in Ref.
the diﬀerence regarding the isotropic or anisotropic rod contraction (see Ref.
[11] for a comparison).

3 Dynamics

Dynamics of a test particle is based on a non-trivial extension of Planck’s
special-relativistic form of Newton’s second law, involving the gravity accel-
eration (1) [12]. It is then extended to any continuous medium [13], including
classical ﬁelds such as Maxwell’s ﬁeld [11]. One gets the following preferred-
frame equation for the energy-momentum tensor T = (T µν):

T ν
µ;ν = bµ,

with

b0(T) ≡ 1
2

gjk,0 T jk,

bi(T) ≡ −1
2

gik,0 T 0k,

(3)

where g = (gij) is the space metric in the preferred reference frame of the
theory. (Indices are raised and lowered with the space-time metric γ = (γµν),
and semicolon means covariant diﬀerentiation using the Christoﬀel connec-
tion associated with metric γ.) This equation is valid independently of the
possible form for metric γ, in particular independently of whether the grav-
itational rod contraction is isotropic or not.

On the other hand, the equation for the scalar gravitational ﬁeld (the
ether pressure pe) is only partly constrained [8] by the assumption [2] that
Newton’s theory has to be recovered for ρe = Constant, and that the com-
pressible case should be associated with a wave equation. A further constraint
on the scalar ﬁeld equation is that this equation, together with Eq.(2), should
imply an exact local conservation law for the energy [12], i.e., an equation that
may be set in the form of the usual continuity equation. Then, the scalar ﬁeld
equation is not far from being ﬁxed. E.g., in the case with the anisotropic
rod contraction, a deﬁnite equation has been assumed for pe [7, 12], which
thus made the theory entirely closed.

4 Observational test

Much work has been done to test the theory obtained with the anisotropic
gravitational rod contraction. That theory seems a priori promising because
it predicts exactly the Schwarzschild exterior metric in the static case with
spherical symmetry [7]. And since it can be proved that no preferred-frame
eﬀect does occur for the gravitational eﬀects on light rays, one indeed obtains
the same predictions for those eﬀects as the ones deduced in general relativ-
ity (GR) from the standard Schwarzschild metric [14]. The theory has been
tested also in celestial mechanics, and it has been found that here too the
preferred-frame eﬀects are not a problem (although, in the case of celestial
mechanics, there are indeed such eﬀects according to that theory) [15]. A
similar formula as that used in GR has been derived for the energy loss by
gravitational radiation, so the theory should pass the binary-pulsar test [16].
Cosmology has also been investigated; in particular, the theory predicts that

4

the cosmic expansion must be accelerated, and there is no singularity with
inﬁnite density [17].

However, that version of the scalar ether theory leads to a disturbing vi-
olation of the weak equivalence principle for an extended body considered at
the point particle limit [18]. This violation is precisely due to the anisotropy
of the metric, therefore it was argued that it should also occur in GR in some
gauges [18]. But it should not occur with the isotropic rod contraction.

5 Modiﬁed equations

Therefore, the author is currently investigating in detail the case with the
isotropic gravitational rod contraction. In coordinates that are adapted to
the preferred reference frame and Galilean for the ﬂat metric, and in the
“non-cosmological” case, the curved space-time metric has then Ni’s form
[19]:

(γµν) = diag(ϕ−1, −ϕ, −ϕ, −ϕ),

where, for the ether theory,

ϕ ≡

ρ∞
e
ρe (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

ρ∞
e (T ) ≡ Supx∈[space]ρe(x, T ).

(The “non-cosmological” case is the one where in fact ρ∞
e does not depend
on the absolute time T . The latter is such that x0 ≡ cT is the time co-
ordinate in coordinates that are adapted to the preferred reference frame
and Galilean for the ﬂat metric.) Speciﬁcally, one is naturally led, in the
framework summarized in Sects. 1 to 3, to set

while stating for the scalar ﬁeld ψ an equation based on the ﬂat d’Alembert
operator:

(cid:3)ψ ≡ ψ,0,0 − ∆ψ =

σ ≡ T 00.

and with x0 = cT where T is the absolute time.) In particular, with the dy-
namical equation (2), this does lead to an exact local conservation law for
the energy. Moreover, the gravitational eﬀects on light rays are the same as
those deduced from the “standard post-Newtonian metric” of general rela-
tivity, which match very well with the observations [20].

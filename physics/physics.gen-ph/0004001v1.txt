The Fractal Universe

Abstract

In this talk, we touch upon the chaotic and fractal aspects of the

Universe.

1 Introduction

It was thought that a subject like Celestial Mechanics belonged to the domain
of deterministic Mechanics[1]. However studies by Laskar[2, 3] subsequently
conﬁrmed, that the inner planetary system is chaotic with a small inverse
Lyapunov exponent sheds new light on the topic. This need not be surpris-
ing because the solar system is really a many body system. Further, it is
possible to treat a system with time varying constant of gravitation as a
dynamical system[4]. Indeed in certain cosmological schemes the universal
constant of gravitation G varies, with time[5, 6, 7].
On the other hand there has been an ongoing debate whether the Universe is
homogeneous at the largest scales or if space time is indeed a diﬀerentiable
manifold at the smallest scales[8].
It must be observed that from one point of view, the universe is not a ”con-
tinuum” but rather, displays a fractal character. Thus within an atom, the
nucleus occupies a very tiny fraction of the volume, roughly ∼ 10−15. Then
there is a wide gap till we reach the orbiting electrons. Similarly there are in-
termolecular distances, interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic.... distances

which provide relatively huge gaps. This is not in the spirit of a uniform
continuum.
We will now argue that this is because, for example the nucleons are bound
together, so also the electrons and the nucleons are bound together, the
atoms in the molecules are bound together... and so on with subsequent
gaps, which leads to some interesting scale dependent consequences, all this
in the context of a Brownian underpinning.

2 The Fractal Universe

In [8] it was argued that we could introduce a ”Scaled” Planck Constant
given by

for super clusters;

for galaxies and

h1 ∼ 1093

h2 ∼ 1074

h3 ∼ 1054

(1)

(3)

for stars.
This was directly related to the fact that we have the following Random Walk
relations:

R ≈ l1qN1
R ≈ l2qN2
l2 ≈ l3qN3
R ∼ l√N

where N1 ∼ 106 is the number of superclusters in the universe, l1 ∼ 1025cms
is a typical supercluster size N2 ∼ 1011 is the number of galaxies in the uni-
verse and l2 ∼ 1023cms is the typical size of a galaxy, l3 ∼ 1 light year is
a typical distance between stars and N3 ∼ 1011 is the number of stars in a
galaxy, R being the radius of the universe ∼ 1028cms, N ∼ 1080 is the num-
ber of elementary particles, typically pions in the universe and l is the pion
Compton wavelength.
The relation (7) was observed nearly a century ago by Weyl and Heddington.

It was shown (Cf.ref.[7]) that far from being empirical this relation can be
deduced on the basis of the ﬂuctuational creation of particles from a back-
ground Zero Point Field or Quantum Vacuum, in a scheme which leads to a
cosmology consistent also with Dirac’s large number coincidences[9] and in
which the gravitational constant G varies with time,

G ∝ T −1.

From this point of view the Random Walk character of equation (7) is not
accidental, and this reasoning could be extended to equations (4),(5) and
(6), in the light of equations (1), (2) and (3). This is against the spirit of
deterministic mechanics and it may be mentioned that it leads to a fractal
character[10].
It may be observed that in all these cases we have a length, the Compton
wavelength or its analogue which deﬁnes regions of matter separating rela-
tively empty spaces.
Infact it was also argued in[8] that these scaled ”Compton wavelengths” and
scaled ”Planck Constants” arise due to the well known equation of gravita-
tional orbits,

GM

L ∼ v2

(8)

On the other hand equation (8) can be viewed as resulting from the Virial
Theorem[11], where the velocity is replaced by the velocity dispersion.
This velocity v would be diﬀerent at diﬀerent scales. For example for a black
hole it would be the velocity of light, while for galaxies it is ∼ 107cms per
second[12]. It is this circumstance that produces the above scales leading to
fractality.
We could go one step further, because we expect that the same eﬀect would
apply to solar type systems: The planets and other objects are bound quite
close to the sun compared to the interstellar distances. Infact we can verify
that this is so for Kuiper Belt objects which have been studied in the recent
past[13]. In this case a typical size is ∼ 5km, the distances are ∼ 1015cm,
masses are ∼ 1019gms their number is ∼ 1010 while an application of equation
(8) shows that the velocities are ∼ 105cms per second. It can now be shown
quite easily that this deﬁnes a scaled Planck Constant h4 ∼ 1034.
Incidentally from (8) we could easily deduce that the angular momentum J
is given by

J ∝ M 2

(9)

It is quite remarkable that the equation (9) also applies to elementary par-
ticles and Regge trajectories[14]. This is a further substantiation of the
rationale for the fractal structure given above in the light of bound systems
separated by relatively large and relatively empty spaces and applies right
upto the level of galaxies[15].

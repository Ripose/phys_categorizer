Heat transfer in theory of relativity

Abstract. The traditional Fourier equation just allows us to study the evolution of temperature in an
"undeformable" bar. The search for its relativistic variant is a task which is expected to fail because
in relativity there are no undeformable bars. Rigid bodies, in the sense of "as rigid as possible",
are deformables. In this work we show how to write in relativity the system of equations necessary
to study simultaneously deformation and temperature evolution along a rigid deformable bar. The
solutions of the two simultaneous equations is discussed assuming convenient constitutive relations
for the material. An application is presented.

INTRODUCTION

Since the beginning of relativity, some physicists have been busy looking for an alter-
native form of the Fourier equation that excludes the possibility of energy and signal
transmission at a velocity larger than c. We think that this will be a task with no success.
In classical physics the Fourier equation is the heat transmission equation in an
undeformable bar. However, in relativity rigid and undeformable are not synonymous.
The undeformable body is a geometrical concept. The rigid body, in the sense of "as rigid
as" possible (the body in which shock waves propagate with velocity c) is deformable.
Heat ﬂux carries momentum and energy. So, in relativity, the interaction between heat
transmission and deformation cannot be ignored, even in the limiting case of rigid
bodies.

We propose ourselves to write a system of equations for temperature evolution and
motion in an elastic bar in the presence of heat transmission. We will study this problem
directly in relativity.

VIBRATION OF AN ELASTIC BAR

A - Without heat transmission

We begin with the following problem: How to write in relativity the equation for the
adiabatic motion (without heat transmission) of an elastic bar? An elegant way to do that
is as follows.

Let X be the "ﬁxed" coordinates of the bar points and (xi, x4 = ct) the coordinates
of an inertial frame S. The bar motion can be described either using the Lagrange
representation x = x(X ,t) or using the Euler representation X = X (x,t).

Each element dX of the bar has a length dXp usually subject to deformation with time.

Its proper length at some instant is given by:

dXp =

¶ x
¶ X dX
√1

with b = v
c

and

v =

¶ x
¶ t .

We choose the variable X such that dX is the length of the bar element dX when not
deformed. The bar deformation ratio is then deﬁned by the variable s given by:

For an elastic body, the pressure p and density r 0 in a local proper frame must be
functions of both the deformation s and temperature T :

s =

dX = s(X ,t) =

p = p(s, T ) ;

r 0 = r 0(s, T )

Let S∗ be the inertial frame with coordinates (x∗, x4
with each point X having velocity v = v(X ,t) in S.
The components T a ∗b ∗ and T ab of the energy-momentum tensor of the bar material in
the neighborhood of point X in S∗ and S are:

Conservation laws can be expressed, in the one-dimensional case, by the two equa-

Let us now study the motion of an elastic bar. In the adiabatic case we may ignore the
temperature and write p = p(s) and r 0 = r 0(s). As an example, we have the elasticity
laws of rigid bodies [1][2][3]:

Using these laws and doing some calculations, we obtain the following two equations:

Although similar to the d’Alembert equation (usually written in Lagrange coordinates),
this equation is written in Euler coordinates and, as such, it has a different physical
meaning.

These are second-order differential equations in X = X (x,t) and T = T (x,t). Note that
both are invariant under the change from frame coordinates S to another inertial frame
S′.

To obtain a well deﬁned mathematical system it is necessary to know the constitutive

relations and an appropriate relativistic relation to play the role of Fourier hypothesis:

Just like Fourier in the XVIII century, what we can do is to adopt some simple phys-
ical hypothesis and look onto the results obtained. If they lead us to manageable math-
ematical equations, providing results in agreement with observations (only expected in
Astrophysics), we will be satisﬁed.

As reasonable assumptions we accept the two different ones coming from Fourier’s
hypothesis (because now x and X are different), and another one built from the available
quantities and respecting the correct physical dimensions:

CONCLUSIONS

The classical Fourier equation is not a good model for a relativistic variant because it
studies heat transmission in an undeformable bar, while in relativity there are no unde-
formable bars. We indicate the way out, showing how to write the system of differential
equations including simultaneously the 3 variables: heat, internal pressure and density.
Meanwhile, we are hostages of the choice of good constitutive relations, relating these
3 variables not only with deformation but also with temperature. These relations should
substitute Hooke’s law and Fourier’s hypothesis. We present an application using the rel-
ativistic adiabatic rigid elastic laws, showing agreement with relativistic elasticity. We
have obtained a new constitutive relation between heat ﬂux and deformation. 3

3 This paper, which was orally presented by one of its authors at the XXVIII Spanish Relativity Meeting,
in Oviedo, September 2005, has not been included in the conference proceeding because a referee
produced the following repport: "The paper by A. Brotas and C. Fernandez entitled "Heat transfer in theory
of relativity" is not acceptable for publication. It uses clumsy and obsolete methods for the treatment of the
relativistic heat transfer problem whose intrinsic difﬁculty is made worse here by unnecessarily mixing
it up with the essentially distinct problem of rigidity. The authors seem to know nothing about the vast
literature on this subject, starting with the Eckhart theory, and proceeding via the textbook treatment of
Landau and Lifshitz to more recent work." It is obvious to us that someone with this opinion will never
be able to understand (the resolution of) the problem of heat transmission in a vibrating bar, neither in
relativity, nor even in classical physics . We would like to have Einstein’s opinion about this matter.

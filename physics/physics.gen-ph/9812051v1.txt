Abstract

We review the origin of the physical consistency of the Lorentz- Poincar´e symme-
try. We outline seemingly catastrophic physical inconsistencies recently identiﬁed for
noncanonical-nonunitary generalized theories deﬁned on conventional spaces over con-
ventional ﬁelds. We review Santilli’s isotopic lifting of the Lorentz-Poincar´e symmetry,
by proving its invariant resolution of said inconsistencies, and universality for the repre-
sentation of all possible spacetimes with a symmetric metric. The explicit isosymmetry
transforms are identiﬁed. Particular care is devoted to the recent discovery of the 11-th
dimensionality of the conventional Poincar´e symmetry and the consequential emergence
of an axiomatically consistent grand uniﬁcation of electroweak and gravitational inter-
actions. The article closes with an outline of the broader geno- and hyper-symmetries
and their isodual for the description of single-valued irreversible systems, multivalued
irreversible systems and antimatter systems, respectively.

1. Lorentz-Poincar´e Symmetry.
Physics is a discipline admitting the reduction of events to primitive symmetries, the most
important ones being the symmetries of our spacetime [1], namely, the rotation, boosts,
translation and discrete symmetries, hereon called the Lorentz -Poincar´e symmetry (or the
L-P symmetry for short) and denoted P(3.1).

We are referring to the most general possible, linear, local-diﬀerential and canonical (for
classical formulations) or unitary (for operator formulations) symmetries of the Minkowski
= (xk, x4), x4 = cot, µ =
space M = M(x, η, R) with: spacetime coordinates x =
1, 2, 3, 4, k = 1, 2, 3, co being the speed of light in vacuum; unit I = Diag. (1, 1, 1, 1); metric
η = Diag.(1, 1, 1,
) of real numbers n with
conventional sum + and associative product

All spacetime theories possessing the Lorentz- Poincar´e symmetry have an impeccable
axiomatic and physical consistency, as it is the case for relativistic quantum mechanics,
special relativity, uniﬁed gauge theories of electroweak interactions, and other theories.

These historical successes of the L-P symmetry are due to the invariant (rather than
covariant) character of the theories, which, in turn, is permitted by their (canonical or)
unitary structure on a Hilbert space

The fundamental Lorentz-Poincar´e invariance begins with the invariance under the time
evolution of the theories, and implies the numerical invariance of the basic units used for
measurements, the preservation in time of Hermiticity-observability, the invariance of the
special functions and transforms used in data elaboration, the uniqueness and invariance of
the numerical predictions, and other features essential for physical consistency.

In the ﬁnal analysis, the above mathematical and physical consistency can be traced to
the fact that classical or operator Lorentz-Poincar´e invariant theories possess a Lie structure.
Even though well known, it may be useful for subsequent referrals to recall the basic

THEOREM 1: All theories with a unitary structure on a Hilbert space over the ﬁeld of
complex numbers possess numerically invariant units, products and eigenvalues, thus being
suitable to represent physical reality.

2. Inconsistencies of Noncanonical-Nonunitary Generalizations.
This paper will have achieved its ﬁrst objective if it contributes to stimulate the awareness by
the contemporary physica community to come to its senses, and address the rather serious
physical inconsistencies of spacetime theories with a noncanonical or nonunitary structure
treated via the mathematics of canonical or unitary theories.

Physics is a quantitative science in which, sooner or later, physical truths always emerge.
Therefore, silence on these inconsistencies can only damage the authors of papers on noncanonical-
nonunitary theories.

The lack of universality of the Poincar´e symmetry for the description of the entire universe
was identiﬁed immediately following its appearance and then conﬁrmed throughout this
century. This scientiﬁc process lead to the construction of numerous theories representing
events in our spacetime, yet violating the Lorentz-Poincar´e axioms in favor of broader axioms.

2

No understanding of the topic of this paper (the isotopies of Lorentz-Poincar´e) can be
claimed without at least a rudimentary knowledge of the now considerable literature on the
indicated inconsistencies.

The ﬁrst generalization is due to Einstein himself who, immediately following the formu-
lation of the special relativity, identiﬁed the impossibility of representing gravitation with
the realization of the Lorentz-Poincar´e axioms of the time, and formulated the general theory
of relativity on Riemannian spaces [2].

While Einstein’s studies based on the Lorentz-Poincar´e symmetry have passed the test of
time and are nowadays more valid than ever, Einstein’s theory of gravitation, which departs
from said symmetry, has been the subject of endless, still unresolved and actually increasing
controversies during this century (see, e.g., representative papers [3] and references quoted
therein).

The origin of most of these controversies has been recently identiﬁed by Santilli [3f] and
can be summarized as follows. The map from the Minkowski metric η to the Riemannian
metric g(x) is clearly a noncanonical transformation at the classical level and a nonunitary
transformation at the operator level,

η

g(x) = U(x)

.

As a result, any theory on a curved manifold is structurally noncanonical-nonunitary,

beginning with its time evolution.

Despite an undeniable mathematical beauty that has attracted so many scholars through-

out this century, a host of rather serious problems of physical consistency then follows.

THEOREM 2 [3f ]: All theories with a nonunitary structure on a conventional Hilbert
space over the ﬁeld of complex numbers, thus including (but not limiting to) all operator
theories of gravity formulated on a curved manifold, possess the following physical inconsis-
tencies:

1) lack of invariant units of space, time, energy, etc., with consequentially impossible

applications to real measurements;

physically acceptable observables;

2) lack of preservation of the original Hermiticity in time, with consequential absence of

3) general violation of causality and probability laws;
4) lack of invariance of conventional and special functions and transforms used in data

elaborations;

5) lack of uniqueness and invariance of numerical predictions;
and have other inconsistencies which render them inapplicable to represent physical reality

The proof of these occurrences is elementary. The lack of invariance of the basic units
is inherent in the very conception of nonunitary transforms (see later on for details). The
lack of preservation in time of Hermiticity-observability is known as Lopez’s lemma [3g].
The violation of probability laws is an evident consequence of the lack of invariance of the
basic units, with consequential violation of causality. Nonunitary transforms do not preserve

3

6
elementary functions such as the exponentiation, let alone special functions and transforms.
The lack of uniqueness of the numerical predictions is evident from the lack of uniqueness of
the value of nonunitary transforms, while the lack of invariance of the numerical predictions
is so evident to require no comments.

Even though known, it may have graphical value to review the fundamental noninvari-

ances under nonunitary transforms from which all the physical inconsistencies follow [3f]:

Santilli [3f,5l,6c] has identiﬁed additional catastrophic inconsistencies which apply to both
noncanonical and nonunitary theories. Recall that all physical theories are based on numbers
and ﬁelds which, in turn, are based on the fundamental (multiplicative) unit. The alteration
of the unit by noncanonical-nonunitary transforms then implies the shift to diﬀerent numbers
and ﬁelds. But noncanonical-nonunitary theories continue to be deﬁned on conventional
numbers and ﬁelds. This implies the collapse of the axiomatic consistency of the entire
theory, including the inapplicability of vector and metric spaces, geometries and topologies,
algebras, groups and symmetries, etc., with no known exceptions.

Note that the latter arguments rules out the physical value of any classical noncanoni-
cal theories, again, because they imply the alteration of the basic unit with consequential
inapplicability of the carrier spaces used to elaborate the theory.

The above catastrophic physical and axiomatic inconsistencies apply in their entirety to
the classical and operator formulation of gravity on curved manifolds. As an example, there
is no known physical meaning or consistency in attempting the ”experimental veriﬁcation”
of the general relativity at a given time t deﬁned via ﬁeld equations on a Riemannian space
over the ﬁelds of real numbers, when the basic unit I is altered at a subsequent time t’,
Eq.
(2.2a). We then have the consequential lack of physical meaning in preserving the
Riemannian space itself because deﬁned on a ﬁeld no longer applicable at t’. The physical
inconsistencies of the operator formulation of gravitation on a curved space are so serious
and transparent to require no further comments.

The ultimate origin of the above gloomy scenario investing about one century of studies
in gravitation is the very notion of curvature itself, because it implies the breaking of the
fundamental Lorentz-Poincar´e symmetry in favor of ”covariance” under a broader, often
undeﬁned symmetry, with the indicated catastrophic consequences.
In fact, the Lorentz-
Poincar´e invariance and the notion of curvature are mutually exclusive in a transparent and
irreconcilable way in their current formulation (see next sections for an alternative).

The limitations of the Lorentz-Poincar´e symmetry have also been felt by numerous other
scholars besides Einstein, particularly during the recent decades. We here quote: the studies

4

by Y. S. Kim and others (see [4a] and references quoted therein), which have the impor-
tant function of extending the applicability of the Lorentz-Poincar´e axioms to their ultima
possibilities for the representation of extended particles; the use of broader symmetries in
an attempt to reach a grand uniﬁcation inclusive of the gravitational interactions (see, e.g.,
[4b]); the broadening of the Lorentz-Poincar´e symmetry inherent in contemporary string
theories [4c]; and numerous other theories (see other papers in this collection [4d]).

It is important for the contemporary physics community to study, understand and, above
all, admit that all generalized theories with a noncanonical or nonunitary structure, even
though possessing an undeniable mathematical beauty, have no known physical application.
Along these lines, in memoir [6e] of 1996, Santilli clearly states the physical inconsistency
of his Birkhoﬃan generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics published in monograph [6g] (by
Springer-Verlag in its most prestigious physics series...), precisely because of its noncanonical
structure formulated on conventional spaces over conventional ﬁelds. The reader should be
aware that the Birkhoﬃan mechanics was proved in the same monograph to be universal
for all well behaved, local-diﬀerential and nonhamiltonian systems with a generalized Lie-
isotopic structure. In the same memoir [6e] Santilli clearly states the additional; physical
inconsistency of his broader classical Lie-admissible mechanics of monograph [12f] which is
universal for all Newtonian system with a non-Lie, yet algebraically consistent structure. In
the same memoir [6e] Santilli presents new invariant classical mechanics of Lie-isotopic and
Lie-admissible type we cannot possibly review here for brevity.

Similarly, in memoir [5l] of 1997, Santilli clearly states the physical inconsistency of
all his generalized operator studies prior to 1997, including all numerous papers written
on hadronic mechanics since its proposal of 1978 [6b], including all papers on operator
Lie-isotopic and Lie-admissible theories (which are also universal for all possible nonlinear,
nonlocal and nonunitary theories with and without an antisymmetric algebras, respectively).
In the same memoir [5l] Santilli proposes fully invariant operator, Lie-isotopic and Lie-
admissible formulations we shall outline in the next sections).

Regrettably, the same clear statements of physical inconsistencies are lacking at this
writing, to our best knowledge, on numerous other generalized theories with a transparent
and incontrovertible nonunitary structure, each theory possessing a rather vast literature,
such as (see [3f] for complete list and references):

H †

1) Dissipative nuclear models with imaginary potentials, H = Ho+iV , and time evolution
A = [A, H, H †] (these theories lose an ”algebra” as commonly
idA/dt = A
understand, in favor of a triple system - as a result of which names such as ”proton” and
”neutron” lose their physical meaning because of the impossibility to even deﬁne spin, mass
and other basic characteristics, let alone treat them);

H

2) Statistical models with external collisions terms with time evolution idρ/dt = [ρ, H]+C
(besides being nonunitary, these theories have no units al all - let alone a noninvariant units
- and have no exponentiation at all, under which catastrophic conditions any application to
physical reality implies exiting science);

3) q- deformations of the Lie product A

transparently nonunitary (all these deformations were ﬁrst introduced by Santilli in his Ph.
D. Thesis of 1967 [12a], although this paternity is ignored in the rather vast literature in the
ﬁeld, evidently to the sole detriment of the authors);

4) Certain quantum groups (evidently those with a nonunitary structure);
5) Weinberg’s nonlinear theory with nonassociative Lie-admissible envelopes (which lacks
any unit, violates Okubo’s no quantization theorem prohibiting the use of nonassociative
envelopes [3h], and has other serious ﬂaws);

6) All known theories of quantum gravity (the indication of theories in this ﬁeld with a

unitary structure would be appreciated);

7) All known supersymmetric theories (evidently because they broaden the very structure
of Lie algebras and groups via the addition of anticommutators, thus resulting in an evident
nonunitary structure);

8) all known studies on Kac-Moody superalgebras (also because they depart from Lie’s

structure with a phase term depending on anticommutators);

9) All known string theories whose nonunitary structure was known since the introduction
of the Beta function by Veneziano and Suzuki, and reinforced via supersymmetries in the
recent studies (see the speciﬁc study [3i]).

Other theories which have a seemingly unitary structure, but depart from other axioms
of Lie’s theory equally possess serious physical ﬂaws. This is the case, for instance for
theories with Hermitean Hamiltonians, yet a structure nonlinear in the wavefunction of the
ψ > (again, see [3f] for details and regferences). These
type H(x, p, ψ, ..)
theories violate the superposition principle, thus being inapplicable to composite systems;
they violate Mackay imprimitivity theorem, thus violating the integrability conditions for
the Galilean and Einsteinian relativities; and have other other ﬂaws.

ψ >= E

Yet other theories violate the locality condition of Lie’s theory, e.g., via ”integral poten-
tials” in the Hamiltonians. These theories are fundamentally ﬂawed on both mathematical
grounds (because the assumption is incompatible with the basic topology) and physical
grounds (because nonlocal interactions generally are of contact-zero range type, thus having
no potential). As such, these theories deserve no further comment (or attention).

In summary, Santilli has established that all theories which violate any of the fundamental
axioms of linearity, locality and canonicity-unitarity of Lie’s theory is physically inconsistent
when formulated via the mathematics of quantum mechanics.

In other cases, the existence of possible inconsistencies requires speciﬁc investigations.
This is the case of Kim’s [4a] theory which replaces the Lorentz-Poincar´e invariance with a
broader covariance. These studies are left to the interested readers.

We close this section by indicating that classical theories of antimatter are generally
inconsistent because they only have one channel of quantization for matter and antimatter.
As a result, their orator image does not yield charge conjugate states, but merely states of
particle with the wrong sign of the charge.

The Riemannian treatment of antimatter is aﬄicted by more catastrophic physical in-
consistencies because, in addition to the above inconsistent operator image, they can only
represent antimatter via the usual energy-momentum tensors which are notoriously positive-
deﬁnite, thus being in dramatic disagreement with the negative-deﬁnite energies need for

6

antiparticles.

These inconsistencies should not be surprising because the biggest unbalance in the
physics literature of this century is precisely the treatment of matter at all possible lev-
els, from Newton to quantum ﬁeld theory, while antimatter is solely treated at the level of
second quantization. But antimatter is expected to exist at the macroscopic level, i.e., that
of entire galaxies or quasars, thus demanding the restoration of a fully equivalent treatment
of matter and antimatter at all levels of study.

By no means all generalized theories of the contemporary physical literature are wrong.
In fact, numerous generalized theories constructed on sound foundations have an impeccable
axiomatic structure, such as the theories by Ahluwalia [4e], Dvoeglazov [4f], and others.

3. Lorentz-Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry
By initially working in a rather solitary way, the Italian-American physicist R. M. Santilli
[5] has constructed a new realization of the Lorentz-Poincar´e axioms which:

1) is ”directly universal” for the representation of all inﬁnitely possible, nonlinear, non-
local and noncanonical-nonunitary theories in our (3+1)-dimensional spacetime with a well
behaved, nowhere singular and symmetric metric (universality), directly in the x-coordinates
of the observer without any use of the transformation theory (direct universality);

2) reconstructs the canonicity or unitarity and invariance, on suitably generalized spaces

over generalized ﬁelds; and

3) resolves the physical inconsistencies indicated in Sect. 2.
Remarkably, Santilli [5] constructed the most general known symmetry of the following
most general possible invariant in (3+1)-dimensions with the indicated topological condition
on the metric:

Unexpectedly, Refs.

[5] then proved that the universal symmetry of interval (3.1) is
locally isomorphic to the symmetry of the conventional invariant (1.1), of course, when
properly formulated. In fact, Santilli insists in his writings that the symmetry of invariant
(3.1) is not new, because it is merely a new realization of the conventional Lorentz-Poincar´e
axioms. This implied the reconstruction of the Lorentz-Poincar´e symmetry as being exact
when popularly believed to be broken, as we shall see (e.g., for gravitation).

Santilli [5] then proved the ”direct universality” of this symmetry via the explicit con-

struction of the most salient applications.

These results were achieved via the prior construction of a new mathematics, originally
proposed in Ref. [6a] under the name of isomathematics from the Greek meaning oif being

7

”axiom-preserving”, and then developed by various authors [6-8] (see [7n] for a comprehensive
literature up to 1984, [5o] for literature up to 1995, and Web Site [7o], Page 18, for a readable
outline). The new mathematics is essentially characterized by new numbers, new ﬁelds, new
spaces, new algebras, etc. called isonumbers, isoﬁelds, isospaces, isoalgebras, etc. For this
reason the universal symmetry of invariant (3.1) is known as the Lorentz-Poincar´e-Santilli
isosymmetry (also called the L-P-S isosymmetry or Santilli’s isopoincar´e symmetry for short),
and it is generally denoted ˆP (3.1) [6-9].

The main working ideas are essentially the following:
1) the generalization (called lifting) of the Minkowski metric η into the most general
possible, well behaved, nowhere singular and symmetric metric ˆη(x, v, d, τ, ψ, ...) = ˆT (x, v,-
d, τ, ψ, ...)
4 well behaved, nowhere singular and positive-deﬁnite (thus
×
diagonalizable) matrix;

η, where ˆT is a 4

×

2) the joint lifting of the fundamental unit of the Minkowski space, I = Diag. (1, 1, 1,

1), by the inverse of the lifting of the metric, ˆI = 1/ ˆT ; and

3) the reconstruction of the entire mathematical foundations of Lorentz and Poincar´e
into a form admitting ˆI, rather than I, as the correct left and right unit of the new theory.

ˆI, isoquotient Aˆ/B = (A/B)

ˆI with isosum ˆn ˆ+ ˆm = (n + m)

ˆI, and other generalized operations.

In turn, the latter liftings imply, for evident reason of consistency, the new isoﬁelds

ˆR = ˆR(ˆn, ˆ+, ˆ

ˆn ˆ
ˆm = (n

×
Under the above conditions, it is evident that ˆR and R are isomorphic, and actually
coincide at the abstract level (because ˆI and I are topologically identical). Despite this
simplicity, the reader should abstain from jumping at conclusion of mathematical triviality
to avoid insidious misrepresentations. As an illustration, ”two multiplied by two is sixteen”
and the number 4 becomes prime for isounit ˆI = 4. This indicates the dependence of number
theory from the assumed unit. Following memoir [d] the Santilli’s isonumber theory has been
the subject of comprehensive studies by C. X. Jiang [7g,7m], Kamiya [7h], Trell [7i], and
other mathematicians.

×

By recalling that metric spaces are deﬁned on a given ﬁeld, the availability of new numbers
and ﬁelds permitted the construction of the isotopies of the Minkowski space, presented for
[5a] (see also [5,6]), today called Minkowski-Santilli isospaces and
the ﬁrst time in Ref.
denoted ˆM = ˆM (ˆx, ˆη. ˆR) with spacetime isocoordinates ˆx = x
ˆI deﬁned precisely on ˆR, and
consequential lifting of algebras, groups, geometries, topologies, etc. [5,6,7].

the new isospaces ˆM are locally isomorphic to the conventional space M; the isosymmetry

being ”axiom-preserving”.

In this way, the isorelativistic theories coincide, by conception and construction, with
conventional relativistic theories at the abstract, realization-free level, by therefore bringing
the applicability of the Lorentz-Poincar´e symmetry and Einstein special relativity to the
unexpected level of universality.

Moreover, Santilli [5] proved that the conventional Poincar´e symmetry is eleven dimen-
sional, and not ten dimensional as believed throughout this century. This additional unex-
pected property was proved via the new invariance of the Minkowskian line element [6e],

By recalling that any new symmetry of spacetime has far reaching physical implications,
Santilli’s discovery of a hitherto unknown additional dimension of the fundamental symme-
tries of our spacetime also has important and novel physical implications outlined below.

The reader should not be surprised that the new symmetry (3.3) has remained unknown
since Lorentz-Poincar´e-Minkowski’s times, and the additional new symmetry (3.4) has re-
mained unknown ’since Hilbert’s time. In fact, their identiﬁcation required the prior discov-
ery of new numbers, those with arbitrary units [6d].

[5c,5d]; Poincar´e symmetry in Ref.

As a guide to the existing main literature, we here indicate the ﬁrst construction of the
isotopies of: rotational symmetry in Ref.
[5b]; Lorentz symmetry in Ref [5a]; SU(2)-spin
symmetry in Refs.
[5e]; and spinorial covering of the
[5g,5h] Santilli achieved the ﬁrst axiomatically
Poincar´e symmetry in Ref.
consistent grand uniﬁcation of electroweak and gravitational interactions known to this au-
thor precisely via the use of the 11-dimensional isopoincar´e symmetry; and in Ref.
[5i] he
presented the isopoincar´e invariant isocosmology. In memoir [5j] one can ﬁnd a comprehen-
sive presentation of the underlying isominkowskian geometry and related reformulation of
gravity; the operator formulations originated in paper [6b] (of 1978), continued in numerous

[5f]. In Refs.

publications (see, e.g., Ref.
[5k,5-1o,12-14]), and reached maturity in memoir [5l]. Clas-
sical realizations of the (isogalilean and) isopoincar´e symmetries were studied in detail in
monographs [5m,5n], while the operator counterparts were studied in detail in monographs
[5o,5p].

Pre-requisites for the above results were the isotopies of Lie’s theory in its various
branches, the universal enveloping associative algebras (including the Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-
Witt theorem), Lie algebras (including the celebrated Lie ﬁrst, second and third theorem),
Lie’s groups, transformation and representation theories. These isotopies were proposed for
the ﬁrst time in Ref.
[6a], and then studied in a variety of works (see monograph [6g] for
the status of the knowledge as of 1983, and monograph [5o] for the status as of 1995). The
emerging theory is today properly called Lie-Santilli isotheory and it is the subject of nu-
merous independent studies, such as those by: Tsagas and Sourlas in the papers of Refs. [7]
and monograph [7j]; Lohmus, Paal and Sorgsepp in monograph [7k]; Vacaru in papers [7]
and monograph [7l]; Kadeisvili in Refs. [8]; and additional authors quoted therein (see the
miscellaneous list of papers [9]).

It is evident that we cannot possibly provide a technical treatment in this note of all the
above results. To avoid lecture-notes for a two-semesters course, we must, therefore, restrict
ourselves to only the most essential aspects.

In summary, all nonunitary transforms are rewritten in an identical isounitary form which

Similarly,isotheories are nonlocal-integral (e.g., because admitting volume integrals to
represent wave-overlappings). These theory are however reconstructed as local-diﬀerential
on isospaces over isoﬁelds, called isolocal-isodiﬀerential, via the embedding of all nonlocal
terms in the isotopic element.

In this way, the universal symmetry of invariant (3.1) is the largest possible isolinear,

isolocal and isocanonical or isounitary symmetry of isospacetime.

In inspecting the literature on isotopies, the reader should keep in mind that all references
prior to memoirs [5l,6e], even though formulated on isospaces over isoﬁelds, are not invariant.
After laborious studies, Santilli identiﬁed the origin of the problem where one would expect
it the least, in the ordinary diﬀerential calculus which, contrary to popular beliefs, resulted
to be dependent on the fundamental unit of the base ﬁeld. This point is absent on the vast
literature on diﬀerent calculus through various centuries because for the tacitly assumed
trivial unit I = +1, we have d(+1) = 0, while for more general units with a nontrivial
functional dependence, we evidently have d ˆI(x, v, ...0

= 0.

The latter occurrence required a reformulation of the diﬀerential calculus into a form,
called isodiﬀerential calculus, which is compatible with the generalized unit of the base ﬁeld,
ﬁrst achieved by Santilli in memoir [6e] via the main rules

ˆdˆxµ = ˆI µ

The above new calculus was then applied in memoir [5j] to the construction of a novel
geometry, the isominkowskian geometry which resulted to be a symbiotic uniﬁcation of the
Minkowskian features (as reported above), plus the machinery of Riemann (because the
isominkowskian metric has an x-dependence), including the isochristoﬀel’s symbols, isoco-
variant isodiﬀerential, isocovariant isoderivative, etc.,

By keeping in mind that conventional and isotopic diﬀerentials and derivatives coincide
at the abstract level, all papers on isotopies prior to 1996 can be easily completed into a fully
invariant form via the mere re-interpretation of the symbols ”d” and ”∂” as being isotopic.

Numerous applications and experimental veriﬁcations of the isorelativistic theories have

been worked out to date by various authors, among which we indicated:

A) Particle physics:

the universality of the isominkowskian geometry for the ge-
ometrization of all physical media, whether of low density (such as our atmosphere) or of high
density (such as the interior of hadrons and stars) with an excellent ﬁt of experimental data
[10a]; the universality of the Lorentz-Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry for the representation
of arbitrary local speeds of light [10b] as established by evidence [11]; the exact-numerical
representation of the Minkowskian anomalies in the behavior of the meanlife of unstable
hadrons with speed [10c]; the exact-numerical representation of the experimental data from
the Bose-Einstein correlation [10d]; the achievement of a true conﬁnement of quarks (with
an identically null probability of tunnel eﬀects for free quarks) within a perturbatively con-
vergent theory and conventional SU(3) quantum numbers [10e,10f,10g]; the reconstruction
of the exact parity, Lorentz and Poincar´e symmetries in particle physics when believed to
be broken [5p]; and other veriﬁcations.

B) Nuclear Physics:

the reconstruction of the exact isospin symmetry in nuclear
physics [5d]; the ﬁrst exact-numerical representation of all total nuclear magnetic moments
via the invariant representation of the deformation of shape of the nucleons [10h]; the ﬁrst
exact representation of the synthesis of neutrons as they occur in stars at their beginning,
from protons and electrons only (thus excluding the yet unavailable remaining baryons with
consequential impossibility to use quark theories) [5f]; the prediction that the neutron, a
naturally unstable particle, can be stimulated to decay via suitable resonating mechanisms
which are possible for a nonunitary theory although simply inconceivable for quantum me-
chanics, and consequential prediction of a novel subnuclear energy currently under industrial
development [10i]; and other veriﬁcations.

C) Astrophysics and cosmology: the exact-numerical representation of the large
diﬀerence in cosmological redshift between quasars and galaxies when physically connected
according to gamma spectroscopic evidence (as due to Santilli’s isodoppler shift within the
huge quasars chromospheres according to which light exits quasars already redshifted to
the value of the associated galaxy) [10j]; the ﬁrst and still the only available numerical
representation of the internal quasars redshift and blueshift [10k]; the elimination of the
missing mass in the universe [5i]; and other veriﬁcations.

D) Superconductivity: the ﬁrst and only known model of the Cooper pair with an
explicitly attractive force between the two identical electrons of the pair in remarkable agree-
ment with experimental data [10l,10m]]; and other veriﬁcations.

E) Chemistry: the ﬁrst known representation of the binding energy, electric and mag-
netic moments, and other characteristics of the hydrogen, water and other molecules which
are exact to the seventh digit (quantum chemistry still misses about 2% of the binding en-
ergies, with much bigger insuﬃciencies in electric and magnetic moments, which at times
even have the wrong sign) [10n,10o]]; several independent experimental veriﬁcations of the
prediction of a new chemical species composed of conventional molecules and atoms under
a new magnetic bond originating from the polarization the orbits of the valence electrons
(which produce a ﬁeld about 1,400 times stronger than nuclear magnetic ﬁelds) and related
new industry of magnetically polarized gases [10p,10q]; and other veriﬁcations.

4. Direct Universality of the L-P-S Isosymmetry
The Lorentz-Poincar´e-Santilli (L-P-S) isosymmetry is directly universal for closed-isolated
systems verifying conventional total conservation laws, with linear and nonlinear, local and
nonlocal and potential-Hamiltonian as well as nonpotential-nonhamiltonian internal dynam-
ics, where: 1) the veriﬁcation of conventional total conservation laws is established by the
fact that the generators of the isopoincar´e symmetry are conventional (see next section); 2)
all linear, local and potential forces are represented via the conventional Hamiltonian; and
3) all ”non-non-non” eﬀects are represented with the isounit.

The understanding of isotopic theories requires at least a rudimentary knowl;edge of
the above direct universality, if nothing else, to prevent the alternative use for the same
problem of theories with catastrophic physical inconsistencies. The best way to achieve a
rapid and intuitive understanding is the geometric way. In turns this is useful to understand
the local isomorphism of the conventional and isotopic spacetime symmetries even prior to
their treatment in the next section.

As it is well known, the Minkowskian geometry and the rotational-Lorentz-Poincar´e
symmetry can only characterize perfectly spherical and perfectly rigid shapes r2 = x2+y2+z2
which are geometrically represented via the unit of the Euclidean subspace I = Diag.(1, 1, 1).
In fact, any shape other than the perfect spere and any deviation from its perfect rigidity
imply the collapse of the pillar of spacetime symmetries, the rotational symmetry.

Santilli [5b] achieves the most general possible, signature preserving (compact) defor-
mation of the sphere while preserving the rotational symmetry as exact. Recall that the
Euclidean unit represents in a dimensionless form the basic units of length along the three
space axes, I = Diag.(1cm2, 1cm2, 1cm2), where the square is evidently due to quadratic
character of the interval. Then, jointly with the lifting of the sphere into the most general
possible spheroidal ellipsoids, Santilli lifts the corresponding units by the inverse amount,

r2 = x2 + y2 + z2

→
I = Diag.(1cm2, 1cm2, 1cm2)

rˆ2 = x2/n2

each semiaxis is subjected to the lifting 1k →
by the inverse amount, 1kcm2
kcm2. This implies the preservation of the original
n2
numerical value of the semiaxes in isospace. The latter occurrence is due to the fact that all
invariants are elements of the underlying ﬁeld. As such, they should be written in general
r2 = (x2 + y2 + z2)
I, where I is the unit of the ﬁeld. The preservation of the
perfect spheridicity under the liftings (4.1) then follows, as established by invariant (3.3).
The extension to shapes other than spheroidal ellipsoids is easily achieved via nondiagonal
positive-deﬁnite isounits (see monograph [5p] for brevity).

The understanding of the perfect spheridicity of rˆ2 = x2/n2

then permits the understanding of the property that, contrary to all popular beliefs through-
out this century, the rotational symmetry remains indeed perfectly exact for all inﬁnitely
possible compact deformations of the sphere.

By comparison, the representation of extended particles by Y. S. Kim [4a] is a particular
case of Santilli broader representation [5a,5b]. As indicated earlier, the former can only
occur for perfectly spherical and perfectly rigid shapes, while the latter occurs for arbitrarily
nonspherical and deformable shapes. Whenever the former is extended to include the latter,
the catastrophic physical inconsistencies of Sect. 2 are activated, trivially, because the map
from a perfectly spherical to a nonspherical shape is necessarily noncanonical- nonunitary.
The restriction of particle/ charge distributions to be perfectly spherical and perfectly
rigid has rather serious physical implications. As an illustration, it prohibits the achievement
(indicated in Sect. 3) of an exact representation of nuclear magnetic moments (which require
precisely a nonspherical deformation of nucleons), and other applications.

This illustrates the comment of Sect. 2 to the eﬀect that the work of Ref.

[4a] and
literature quoted therein is invaluable to establish the maximal capability of the conventional
realization of the Lorentz-Poincar´e axioms, with the clear understanding necessary not to
exit science that, by no means, it is the ﬁnal theory. At any rate, the little groups of Ref. [4a]
are contained as a particular case of Refs. [5]; Ref. [4a] departs from the Lorentz-Poincar´e
[5] restore the ”invariance”
teaching of ”invariance” in favor of a ”covariance, while Refs.
[4a] can be used
in its entirety; and, ﬁnally, the entire mathematical treatment of Ref.
for the representation of the missing nonspherical and deformable shapes via Santilli’s re-
interpretation of all symbols as being of isotopic character.

The representation via the Lorentz-Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry of extended, nonspheri-
cal and deformable shapes is only the beginning of its direct universality. The next important
applications are the representation of arbitrary speeds of light while preserving on isospace
ˆM of the maximal causal speed of M (the speed of light in vacuum), and consequential
preservation of the light cone. Contrary to a popular belief throughout this century, this
feature establishes that the Lorentz-Poincar´e symmetry is exact for arbitrary speeds of light.

Recall that Minkowski originally wrote his metric in the form η = Diag.(1, 1, 1,
o).
Therefore, the fourth component of the Minkowski metric represents in a dimensionless form
1cm2/sec2). In the
the unit cm2/sec2, and the metric explicitly reads η = Diag.(1, 1, 1,
isominkowskian space, Santilli [5a] considers: 1) the lifting from c2
o to an arbitrary local
speed c2 = c2
4(x, v, d, τ, ψ, ...), where n is the local index of refraction; and 2) the joint
lifting the unit by the inverse amount. It is then evident that the dual lifting

−

(4.2)

implies the preservation of the maximal causal speed co on isospaces over isoﬁelds (that is,
when considered with respect to ˆI).

It is evident that, when projected in the ordinary spacetime (that is, when considered

with respect to I) the isorelativistic theory represents the local speed c = co/n4.

The additional use of the isosphere then yields Santilli’s light isocone [5] which is the
perfect cone in isospace. The abstract identity pf the isocone with the conventional cone
is such that even the characteristic angles of the two cones coincide (to prevent insidious
misrepresentation, one should know that the proof of this occurrence requires the use of

14

the isotrigonometric and isohyperbolic functions [5p], the use of conventional mathematics
in isospace being as fundamental inconsistent as the treatment of conventional theories via
isomathematics ).

Recall that speeds c < co are known since the discovery of the refraction of light, while
speeds c > co have been experimentally measured in recent times, and can be considered as
established for all interior media of high density, such as those in the interior of hadrons or
of stars [11].

It then follows that the isopoincar´e symmetry extends the applicability of the conventional
Einsteinian axioms, from their sole validity for speeds of light in vacuum, to arbitrary speeds
within physical media. To put it diﬀerently, the special relativity becomes ”directly universal”
when formulated in the form today known as Santilli’s isospecial relativity [5-10].

A glimpse at the applications may be of some value here. Nowadays the light cone is
used for all calculations outside gravitational horizons and in similar conditions. However,
in the outside of gravitational horizon we have something dramatically diﬀerent than the
vacuum. In fact we have a region of space ﬁlled up of hyperdense chromospheres in which the
speed of light, ﬁrst of all, positively is not that in vacuum and, second it is locally variable.
As a result, outside gravitational horizons we have highly deformed ”cones”. Santilli’s light
isocone permits a more scientiﬁc study of these regions thanks precisely to the admission of
local arbitrary speeds.

Note that the traditional hopes of representing light within physical media via photons
scattering among molecules (to maintain the speed of light in vacuum co) has been discredited
by the recent experimental evidence of speeds bigger than co. At any rate, we are referring
here to a purely classical event (the propagation of electromagnetic waves within physical
media at speeds c < co) which, as such, cannot be credibly reduced to photons in second
quantization without a prior classical representation.

By no means the above topics are pure semantic, because they have deep implications in

the numerical values of physical characteristics throughout the universe.

As an illustration in the macrocosm, the belief of the validity of the conventional light cone
everywhere in the universe leads to the current beliefs of the size of the universe (generally
derived from the cosmological redshift). However, the admission of the physical reality
that the speed of light decreases within astrophysical chromospheres implies the necessary
consequence that light exits said chromospheres already redshifted (see Santilli’s companion
paper [10b] for the explicit treatment). The decrease of the currently believed size of the
universe is then simply incontrovertible.

As an illustration in the microcosm, the possibility to stimulate the decay of the neutron
and related new forms of energy mentioned in Sect. 3, originates precisely from the admission
that light travels in the hyperdense ’ medium inside hadrons at a speed diﬀerent than that
in vacuum.

Next, it is easy to see that all inﬁnitely possible Riemannian metric g(x) are simple par-
ticular cases of the isometric ˆη(x, v, d, τ, φ, ...). In fact, Santilli [5j] has introduced the novel
isominkowskian formulation of gravitation and general relativity based on the Minkowskian

15

factorization of the Riemannian metric

g(x) = ˆTgrav.(x)

η, ˆIgrav.(x) = 1/ ˆTgrav.,

×

(4.3)

and consequential reconstruction of the entire Riemannian formalism into such a form to
admit ˆIgrav. as the correct left and right new unit.

This result was possible thanks to the construction of the novel isominkowskian geometry
[loc. cit.] as a symbiotic uniﬁcation of the Minkowskian and the Riemannian geometries
indicated in Sect. 3.

A visible illustration is the isominkowskian formulation of Schwarzschild [5j]

(4.4)

where, as one can see, curvature disappears completely because it is embedded in the
diﬀerential calculus, thus permitting the regaining of a fully minkowskian structure for
Schowarzschild’s metric.

Santilli’s isominkowskian formulation of gravity implies considerable structural novelties,

such as:

1) The formulation, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, of gravitation under the rigid
validity of a symmetry (rather than the usual covariance), which results to be isomorphic to
the Poincar´e symmetry.

2) The abandonment of the conventional curvature in favor of isoﬂatness, that is, ﬂatness

in isospace, as transparent in the reformulation (4.4).

3) The uniﬁcation of the special and general relativities which are now diﬀerentiated by
the unit, rather than by the geometry, while the underlying geometry remains unchanged.
Equivalently, we can say that Santilli’s isominkowskian representation of gravity extends the
direct universality of the special relativity to include gravitation where nobody looked before,
in the unit of the theory.
As shown in Ref.

[5j], this reformulation of gravity permits the resolution of at least

some of the controversies in gravitation that have raged through this century, such as:

A) The reconstruction on isospaces over isoﬁelds of full canonicity or unitarity (isocanon-
ical or isounitary laws). In turn, this permits the regaining for gravitation of invariant basic
units of measurements, the preservation of Hermiticity-observability at all times, and resolves
the other physical inconsistencies of general relativity indicated in Sec. 2.

B) The compatibility between relativistic and gravitational total conservation laws, which
is established via the mere visual inspection that the generators of the isopoincar´e and
conventional Poincar´e symmetries coincide (see next section). It is instructive to compare
this geometric- algebraic simplicity with the complexity of the conventional proof of total
conservation laws in general relativity.

C) The existence, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, of a consistent relativistic limit of

Riemann, which is now established via the limit ˆIgrav. →
Moreover, the regaining of ﬂat gravity in isospace permitted the achievement of the
ﬁrst grand uniﬁcation of electroweak and gravitational interactions which is axiomatically

I); and other resolutions.

16

×

consistent [5g,5h]. In Ref.
[5h], p. 324, one can read the viewpoint according to which:
”gravitation has always been present in uniﬁed gauge theories. It did creep in un-notices
because occurring where nobody looked for, in the ’unit’ of gauge theories”. Electroweak
gauge theories can be identically formulated on isospaces. Then, gravity is contained in the
unit of the isosymmetries ˆU (2)

ˆU (1).

The resulting iso-grand-uniﬁcation (IGU) also identiﬁes the technical reasons for the
axiomatic inconsistency of other uniﬁed theories. In fact, electromagnetic interactions, as
well as electroweak interactions in general, rigorously follow the Poincar´e symmetry. Any
attempt at adding gravitation without a symmetry is then doomed to failure. Via his refor-
mulation of gravitation in such a way to admit a symmetry isomorphic to Poincar´e, Santilli
has resolved the apparently deepest historical obstacle against a grand uniﬁcation. This
illustrates a reason why all attempts initiated by Einstein and continued by many scholars
were doomed to fail from their very foundations. Other resolutions of structural incompati-
bilities between gauge and gravitational theories are related to the treatment of antimatter
and will di discussed later on.

Santilli has also pushed his studies to the formulation of the novel isocosmology [5i] which
brings the validity of the studies by Lorentz, Poincar´e, Einstein, Minkowski, and others to
a true ”universal” level, that of cosmological character inclusive of gravitation. Some of
the rather intriguing implications of the isocosmology are: the elimination of the need for
c2 =
a ”missing mass” in the universe because the energy equivalence is now E = m
c2
o/n2
c2
o, with an average value of c for galaxies, quasars and the
universe in general much bigger than co when considering all interior gravitational problems;
a signiﬁcant reduction of the currently believed dimension of the universe (indicated earlier
in this section); and other intriguing features.

By no means this exhausts all the applications of the isominkowskian geometry, isopoincar´e
symmetry and isospecial relativity. The next application is the study of relativistic and grav-
itational interior problems at large, e.g., the formulation of the Schwarzschild solution for
interior problems with local speed c = co/n4(x, v, d, τ, ...) [5j].

In particular, gravitational horizons (singularities) result to be the zeros of the time
(space) component of the isounit, as one can verity from structures (4.4). This is not a
mere mathematical curiosity. Gravitational collapse is one of the most complex physical
events in the universe, with the consequentially most complex possible dependence of the
metric on all conceivable local quantities. In particular, as typical of interior trajectories
(such as those of missiles in atmosphere), we must expect in the gravitational collapse an
arbitrary dependence of the metric in the velocities (which is simply impossible for Riemann),
nonlocal- integral eﬀects due to total wave-overlappings of a large number of wavepackets
in a small region of space (which eﬀects are precluded by the topology of Riemann), and
interactions which violate the integrability conditions for the existence of a Lagrangian (the
conditions of variational selfadjointness [6g]) which is also beyond any dream of representa-
tion via Riemann. In short, the assumption of the Riemannian geometry as being exact for
gravitational collapse in general and for the study of gravitational singularities in particular,
is so questionable to imply exiting science.

All the above interior features are directly represented by Santilli’s isominkowskian ge-

17

ometry, thus permitting, for the ﬁrst time, more realistic studies of interior gravitational
problems in general, gravitational collapse in particular, and related topic, such as whether
or not the universe started from a ”big bang”.

The direct universality of the isorelativistic formalism is also established by the fact that
it admits as a particular case all inﬁnitely possible Galilean-types of space and time. They
are evidently admitted under the particular Kronecker structure of the isounit

5. Explicit form of trhe L-P-S Isotransforms.
In this section we outline the operator version of the L-P-S isosymmetry ˆP (3.1), with partic-
ular reference to the explicit form of the isosymmetry transformations (called isotransforms).
In inspecting this section the reader should keep in kind that it provides a direct op-
erator theory of gravity called operator isogravity [5j,5l] under the sole restriction of the
isominkowskian metric η(x, v, d, ]τ, ψ, ...) to be the conventional Riemannian metric g(x).
The resulting new theory coincides at the abstract level with the conventional relativistic
quantum mechanics, thus preserving all its properties. This occurrence is suﬃcient, alone,
to establish the axiomatic consistency of operator isogravity beyond scientiﬁc doubt. Such a
’consistency should then be compared, for scientiﬁc objectivity, with the catastrophic phys-
ical inconsistencies of quantum gravity outlined in Sect. 2.

The clear understanding is that the operator isorelativistic theory outlined below has

applications much beyond that of the mere operator formulation of gravity (Sect. 4).

The isosymmetry ˆP (3.1) is characterized by the conventional ten generators and param-
eters of P(3.1), only lifted into their corresponding forms on isospaces over isoﬁelds, plus the
for the new symmetries (3.3), (3.4) with parameter ρ

the isogroup. Note that the latter essentially acts as the isotopies of the conventional ”scalar
extensions” of Lie’s symmetries, as familiar for the Galilei’s (but not for the Poincar´e)
symmetry. Santilli has identiﬁed their origin in the change of the unit of the underlying ﬁeld
and found its explicit symmetry transforms.

Note the appearance of the isotopic element ˆT (x, v, d, τ, ψ, ...)) in the exponent of the
group structure. This illustrates the nontriviality of the Lie-Santilli isotheory and, in par-
ticular, its nonlinear, nonlocal and nonunitary characters in its projection on conventional
spaces over conventional ﬁelds.
Intriguingly, the isopoincar´e symmetry recovers linearity,
locality and unitarity on ˆM over ˆR.

Conventional linear transforms on M violate isolinearity on ˆM and must then be replaced

with the isotransforms

where [Aˆ,B] is the Lie-Santilli isoproduct (ﬁrst proposed in [6b]), which does indeed satisfy
the Lie axioms in isospace, as one can verify.

Note for the particular case ˆη = g(x) the appearance of the Riemannian metric as the
’structure functions’. Note also that the momentum components isocommute (while they
are notoriously non–commutative for quantum gravity). This conﬁrms the achievement of
the isoﬂat representation of gravity indicated in Sect. 4, which is seemingly mandatory to
achieve a consistent grand uniﬁcation of gravity with other interactions.

The local isomorphism ˆp(3.1)

p(3.1) is ensured by the positive–deﬁniteness of ˆT . In
fact, the use of the generators in the form ˆM µ

phism is suﬃcient, per se’, to guarantee the axiomatic consistency of the L-P-S isosymmetry
and all applications in which it is exact, including operator isogravity.

These equations are not a mere mathematical curiosity because they establish the com-
patibility of operator isogravity with experimental data in view of the much smaller value of
gravitational over electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. The isotopic uniﬁcation of
the special and general relativities is, therefore, compatible with experimental evidence at
both classical and operator levels.

The explicit form of the isosymmetry transformations are by:
1) Isorotations [5b], which can be computed from isoexponentiations (5.4) resulting
in the explicit form in the (x,y)–plane (were we ignore hereon the factorization of ˆI for

all ellipsoidical deformations of the sphere indicated in Sect. 4, as the reader is encouraged to
verify. The local isomorphism between ˆO(3) and O(3) then conﬁrms the perfect spheridicity
of ellipsoids on isospace (the isosphere).

Note that the space components of all gravitational theories characterize an isosphere

when reformulated on isoeuclidean spaces over isoﬁelds.

Note that the above isotransforms are formally similar to the Lorentz transforms, as

expected from their isotopic character.

Note also that all (3+1)-dimensional Riemannian models of gravity, when subjected to
their isominkowskian reformulation, characterize precisely light isocones on ˆM over ˆR. All
possible gravitational models are therefore uniﬁed into one single primitive geometric notion.

3) Isotranslations [5e], which can be written

and they are also nonlinear, as expected.

x = (r,

−

where ˆπ = π

ˆI, ˆτ = τ

ˆI, and π, τ are the conventional inversion operators.

×

×

Despite such a simplicity, the physical implications of the isoinversions are nontrivial
because of the possibility of reconstructing as exact discrete symmetries when believed to be
broken, which can be achieved by embedding all symmetry breaking terms in the isounit
[5p].

One should be aware that the reconstruction of exact spacetime and internal symmetries
is a rather general property of the Lie–Santilli isotheory, thus holding also for continuous
symmetries.
In fact, contrary to popular beliefs, this section shows that the Lorentz and
Poincar´e symmetries are exact for gravitation.

5) Isoselfscalar transforms [5h], which are characterized by invariances (3.3)-(3.4),

i.e.,

(5.14)

where ρ is the parameter characterizing the novel 11-th dimension.

The implications of the 11-th invariance of spacetime is now clear: it permits the achieve-
ment of a consistent grand uniﬁcation of gravitation and electroweak interactions according
to a mechanism essentially equivalent to the uniﬁcation of electromagnetic and weak interac-
tions, the generalization of the parameter ρ into the positive-deﬁnite function ˆTgrav.(x) and

where the equality holds for the two sides computed in their respective spaces and ﬁelds.

By looking in retrospect, we can say that the apparent reason why a grand uniﬁcation
was not achieved during this century until recently was theabsencek of one dimension in the
basic symmetry of spacetime [5g,5h].

The above results can be summarized with the following:

THEOREM 3 (Direct universality of the L-S-P isosymmetry [5]): The 11-dimensional,
Lorentz-Poincar´e-Santilli isosymmetry on isominkowski spaces over real isoﬁelds with com-
mon, 4
4-dimensional, positive-deﬁnite isounits constitutes the largest possible isolinear,
isolocal and isocanonical-isounitary invariance of isoseparation (3.1), thus being directly uni-
versal for all possible, Galilean, relativistic or gravitational, interior and exterior spacetime
theories with a well behaved symmetric metric.

×

It should be stressed that for any arbitrarily given diagonal metric ˆη = ˆT

η there is
nothing to compute because one merely plots the ˆTµµ terms in the above given isotransforms.
The invariance of interval (3.1) is then assured by Theorem 3. The (2 + 2)–de Sitter or
other diagonal cases can be derived from the above theorem via mere changes of signature
or dimension of the isounit. The case of nondiagonal metrics will be considered in the next
section.

×

6. Santilli’s geno- and hyper-symmetries and their isoduals.
The limitations of fundamental theories can be best identiﬁed in the writings of their orig-
inators (rather than of their followers). For instance, Lorentz was the ﬁrst to identify the
insuﬃciency of his historical symmetry for the speeds of light of the physical reality and
conducted the ﬁrst search for a possible broader symmetry for speeds c < co [11a] (while
his followers proclaimed for the rest of this century the ”universal constancy of the speed of
light”).

Receptive to the and other historical teachings, Santilli has identiﬁed the major limitation
of his isotopies as bneing their inability to permit axiomatically correct studies on irreversibil-
ity . In fact, being ”axiom-preserving”, the isotopies preserve the original inability by the
L-P axioms to describe irreversibility.

For these reasons, Santilli conducted his studies via the broader genomathematics ini-
tiated in his Ph.D. thesis back in 1967, [12a] and then studied in various works [5a,5b,5c,
5l,6e,12].
Invariance was achieved for the ﬁrst time in memoir [12e] of 1997. This is a
broader mathematics possessing a Lie-admissible (rather than Lie-isotopic) structure (a gen-
erally nonassociative algebra U with abstract product ab is said to be Lie- admissible when
the attached algebra U −, which is the same vector space as U equipped with the product [a,
b] = ab - ba, is Lie-isotopic).

We cannot possibly provide a technical review of the covering genotopic formalism to
avoid another two-semesters volume of lecture notes. However, this presentation would be
insuﬃcient in our view (if not potentially misleading) without at least the main idea of the
genotheories.

In essence, while other scholars searched for departures from the Lie axioms, Santilli

22

devoted his research life to preserve the ’ same axioms and search instead for broader real-
izations. This approach was eventually rewarded because, while other generalizations outside
Lie have the catastrophic physical inconsistencies of Sect. 2, the preservation of the abstract
Lie axioms permitted their resolutions while achieving a structurally broader theory.

The main idea of the genoties is best presented in Ref. [12d] and consists in the identiﬁ-

cation in Lie groups and algebras the following abstract bimodular structure

A(w) = U

characterized by: I) a modular associative action to the right >; II) a modular-associative
axioms to the left <; and III) an inter-relation between the two actions generally given by
Hermitean conjugation.

The genotopic/Lie-admissible formulations then introduce a realization of these axioms
more general than that by the isotopc formulations given by the mere relaxation of the
symmetric character of the isounit.

This yields two diﬀerent generalized mathematics, one for the ordered product to the
right > (representing motion forward in time), and one for the ordered product to the left
< (representing motion backward in time), with two genounits, two genoproducts, etc.,

The above elements must then be completed, for necessary reasons of consistency, with
the forward and backward genoﬁelds, genospaces, genodiﬀerential calculus, genogeometries,
etc. [6e,12e]. The explicit Lie-admissible realization of Lie’s axioms I, II and III then reads

As one can see, the above structures permit an axiomatic treatment of irreversibility.
In fact the formulation is structurally irreversible in the sense that it is irreversible for all
possible conventional, reversible Hamiltonians. This is precisely what needed for a serious
study of irreversibility because all action-at-a-distance interactions are well known to be
reversible while physical reality is irreversible.

The observation (and admission) of this physical reality is suﬃcient, alone, to establish
that irreversibility should be represented with anything except the Hamiltonian. Santilli rep-
resents irreversibility with nonhermitean, thus irreversible, generalized units. The selection

(6.2)

(6.3)

23

of the units is evidently preferable over an other possible choices because it assures the
invariance of the representation.

In memoirs [5l,6e,12e] Santilli identiﬁes the Lie-admissible structure of the historical
Hamilton equations (those with external terms); introduces a new invariant genohamiltonian
mechanics; identiﬁes the new genoquantization; and works out the invariant Lie-admissible
operator theory. These studies have permitted the reduction of the irreversibility of of our
macroscopic physical reality to the most elementary levels of nature, such as an electron in
the core of a star considered as external.

Mutatis mutandae, the belief that an electron in the core of a star is a reversible system
or, worse, that it can be described by quantum mechanics, implies the exiting of science
(because it implies the belief of the perpetual motion within a hyperdense physical medium
because of the usual conservation laws of the theory). Rather than adapting physical reality
to [re-existing theories, Santilli has constructed a theory that can represent physical reality
in an invariant way.

The same quoted contributions on genotopies identiﬁed the limitations of the formulations
themselves as being single-valued (e.g., a Hamiltonian has only one genoeigenvalue per each
direction of time). Illert and Santilli [13a] provided evidence of the need for multi-valued
methods in biological structures.

In fact, mathematical treatments complemented with computer visualization establish
that the shape of sea shells can be described via the conventional single-valued three-
dimensional Euclidean space according to the empirical perception of our three Eustachian
tubes. However, the same space is basically insuﬃcient to represent the growth in time of
In fact, computer visualization show that, under the exact imposition of the
sea shells.
Euclidean axioms, sea shells ﬁrst grow in time in a distorted way and then crack.

Ref. [13a] then showed that the minimally consistent representation of sea shells growth
requires six dimensions. But sea shells exist in our environment and can be observed via
our three-dimensional perception. The solution proposed by Santilli [13b] is that via his
multi-valued hypermathematics essentially characterized by the relaxation of the single-valued
character of the genounits (while preserving their nonsymmetric character as a necessary
condition to represent irreversible events).

All aspects of the dual Lie-admissible formalism admit a unique, and signiﬁcant extension
to the above hyperstructures (for their expression viaweak equalities and operations one may
consult Ref. [13c]).

The belief in the existence of a ”ﬁnal theory for everything” can only occur to feverish
minds because so dissonant with the complexity of our reality. Despite their remarkable
generality, hyperformulations too cannot describe the entire universe. In fact, as indicated
in Sect. 2, all available classical theories (including conventional, isotopic, genotopic and
hyperstructural theories) cannot consistently represent antimatter at the classical level (see
the end of Sect. 2).

After several years of research, Santilli resolved the unbalance between matter and anti-
matter in the physics of this century by introducing (for the ﬁrst time in Ref. [5b] of 1985),
the map, called isoduality, for an arbitrary quantity A with underlying spaces and ﬁelds

A(x, v, ψ, ...)

Ad =

x†,

v†,

ψ†, ...)

−

−

−

−

→

(6.5)

The above map is mathematically nontrivial, e.g., because it implies the ﬁrst construction
on records of numbers with negative units and norm [6d]. Physically the map is also nontrivial
because it implies an isodual image of our universe which coexists with our own, yet it is
physically distinct.

We have in this way the isodual conventional, isotopic, genotopic and hyperstructural
mathematics [14], which he then applied to the construction of a new isodual theory of an-
timatter. In particular, at the operator level, isoduality is equivalent to charge conjugation.
The main property here is that charge conjugation is only applicable at the level of second
quantization, while isoduality holds for all levels of study, from Newton to second quanti-
zation, thus resolving the historical unbalance of this century indicated at the end of Sect.
2.

The reader can see the inevitability of the isodual treatment of antimatter by noting that
the fundamental novel invariants (3.3) and (3.4) also hold for negative-deﬁnite units. This
guarantees that all properties and physical laws of the conventional invariants also apply to
antimatter under isoduality, the main diﬀerence being that the treatments of matter and
antimatter are anti-isomorphic to each others, as they should be.

The most general formulation of the theories presented in this paper is the isoselfdual
hypercosmology [5i], in which the ”universe”: has a multi-valued structure perceived by
our Eustachian tubes as a single-valued three-dimensional structure; is deﬁned to include

25

biological structures (as it should be); is open-irreversible; admits equal amounts of matter
and antimatter (in its limit formulation verifying Lies axioms III of Eq. (6.1)); and possesses
all identically null total characteristics of time, energy, linear and angular momentum, etc.
In closing, the reader should be aware that isotopic, genotopic and hyperstructural for-
mulations and their isoduals can be constructed in their entirety via simple nonunitary
transforms of conventional theories, provided that they are applied to the totality of the
original mathematics. For brevity, we refer the reader to [5l,10b,12e].

The latter methods are easily applicable for the explicit construction of the iso-, geno-
and hyper-liftings of the Lorentz-Poincar´e symmetry, including the case of nondiagonal-
nonsymmetric metrics.

7. Concluding remark
The question raised by the studies reviewed in this paper is: why use generalized theories
with limited representational capabilities and catastrophic physical inconsistencies, rather
when we have available axiomatically consistent, invariant and universal formulations ?

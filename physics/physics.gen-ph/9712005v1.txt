We discuss possible violations of Poincar´e’s relativity principle at energy scales close to Planck scale and point

out the potentialities of high-energy cosmic-ray physics to uncover these new phenomena.

1. THE RELATIVITY PRINCIPLE: A
BASIC PHYSICS ISSUE BEHIND A
DEBATE ON PRIORITY

H. Poincar´e was the ﬁrst author to consistently
formulate the relativity principle stating in 1895 [1]:
”Absolute motion of matter, or, to be more pre-
cise, the relative motion of weighable matter and
ether, cannot be disclosed. All that can be done
is to reveal the motion of weighable matter with
respect to weighable matter”

The deep meaning of this law of Nature was fur-

ther emphasized when he wrote [2]:

”This principle will be conﬁrmed with increas-
ing precision, as measurements become more and
more accurate”

The role of H. Poincar´e in building relativity, and
the relevance of his thought, have often been em-
phasized [3,4].
In his June 1905 paper [5], pub-
lished before Einsteins’s article [6] arrived (on June
30) to the editor, he explicitly wrote the relativistic
transformation law for the charge density and ve-
locity of motion and applied to gravity the ”Lorentz
group”, assumed to hold for ”forces of whatever
origin”. However, his priority is sometimes denied
[7,8] on the grounds that ”Einstein essentially an-
nounced the failure of all ether-drift experiments
past and future as a foregone conclusion, contrary
to Poincar´e’s empirical bias” [7], that Poincar´e did
never ”disavow the ether” [7] or that ”Poincar´e
the absolute time of newto-
never challenges...
nian mechanics... the ether is not only the abso-
lute space of mechanics... but a dynamical en-
tity” [8].
It is implicitly assumed that A. Ein-
stein was right in 1905 when ”reducing ether to

the absolute space of mechanics” [8] and that H.
Poincar´e was wrong because ”the ether ﬁts quite
nicely into Poincar´e’s view of physical reality: the
ether is real...” [7]. But modern particle physics
has brought back the concept of a non-empty vac-
uum where free particles propagate: without such
an ”ether” where ﬁelds can condense, the standard
model of electroweak interactions could not be writ-
ten and quark conﬁnement could not be understood.
Modern cosmology is not incompatible with an ”ab-
solute local frame” close to that suggested by the
study of cosmic microwave background radiation.
Then, the relativity principle would become a sym-
metry, a concept whose paternity was attributed to
H. Poincar´e by R.P. Feynman [9]:

”Precisely Poincar´e proposed investigating
what could be done with the equations without al-
tering their form. It was precisely his idea to pay
attention to the symmetry properties of the laws
of physics”

As symmetries in particle physics are in general
violated, Lorentz symmetry may be broken and an
absolute local rest frame may be detectable through
experiments performed beyond the relevant scale.
Poincar´e’s special relativity (a symmetry applying
to physical processes) could live with this situation,
but not Einstein’s approach such as it was formu-
lated in 1905 (an absolute geometry of space-time
that matter cannot escape). But, is Lorentz sym-
metry broken? We discuss here two issues: a) the
scale where we may expect Lorentz symmetry to
be violated; b) the physical phenomena and experi-
ments potentially able to uncover Lorentz symmetry
violation (LSV). Previous papers on the subject are
references [10] to [16] and references therein.

2. SPECIAL RELATIVITY AS A LOW-

ENERGY LIMIT

Low-energy tests of special relativity have cos-
ﬁrmed its validity to an extremely good accuracy,
but the situation at very high energy remains more
uncertain (see [10] to [16]). If Lorentz symmetry vi-
olation (LSV) follows a E2 law (E = energy), sim-
ilar to the eﬀective gravitational coupling, it can
be ≈ 1 at E ≈ 1021 eV and ≈ 10−26 at
E ≈ 100 M eV (corresponding to the highest
momentum scale involved in nuclear magnetic reso-
nance experiments), in which case it will escape all
existing low-energy bounds. If LSV is ≈ 1 at Planck
scale (E ≈ 1028 eV ), and following a similar law,
it will be ≈ 10−40 at E ≈ 100 M eV . Our sugges-
tion is not in contradiction with Einstein’s thought
such as it became after he had developed general
relativity. In 1921 , A. Einstein wrote in ”Geometry
and Experiment”: ”The interpretation of geom-
etry advocated here cannot be directly applied to
submolecular spaces... it might turn out that such
an extrapolation is just as incorrect as an exten-
sion of the concept of temperature to particles of
a solid of molecular dimensions”. It is remarkable
that special relativity holds at the attained accelera-
tor energies, but there is no fundamental reason for
this to be the case above Planck scale.

A typical example of models violating Lorentz
symmetry at very short distance is provided by mod-
els where an absolute local rest frame exists and
non-locality in space is introduced through a funda-
mental length scale a [11]. Such models lead to a
deformed relativistic kinematics of the form [11,16]:
−1 e (k a)
where h is the Planck constant, c the speed of light,
k the wave vector and [e (k a)]2 is a convex function
of (k a)2 obtained from vacuum dynamics. Expand-
ing equation (1) for k a ≪ 1 , we can write:
e (k a) ≃ [(k a)2 − α (k a)4

E = (2π)

−1 h c a

(1)

−2 m2 c2]1/2

+ (2π a)2 h
m being the mass, α a model-dependent constant
≈ 0.1 − 0.01 for full-strength violation of Lorentz
symmetry at momentum scale p ≈ a−1 h , and:
E ≃ p c + m2 c3 (2 p)

(2)

−1

− p c α (k a)

(3)

The ”deformation” ∆ E = − p c α (k a)2/2 in
the right-hand side of (3) implies a Lorentz sym-
metry violation in the ratio E p−1 varying like
Γ (k) ≃ Γ0 k2 where Γ0 = − α a2/2 . If c and α
are universal parameters for all particles, LSV does
not lead to the spontaneous decays predicted in [17]:
the existence of very high-energy cosmic rays can-
not be regarded as an evidence against LSV. With
the deformed relativistic kinematics (DRK) deﬁned
by (1)-(3), Lorentz symmetry remains valid in the
limit k → 0, contrary to the standard T Hǫµ model
[18]. The above non-locality may actually be an
approximation to an underlying dynamics involving
superluminal particles [10,12,15,16], just as electro-
magnetism looks nonlocal in the potential approx-
imation to lattice dynamics in solid-state physics:
−1
→ 0
it would then correspond to the limit c c
i
where ci is the superluminal critical speed.

Are c and α universal? This may be the case
for all ”elementary” particles, i.e. quarks, leptons,
gauge bosons..., but the situation is less obvious for
hadrons, nuclei and heavier objects. From a naive
soliton model [11], we inferred that: a) c is ex-
pected to be universal up to very small corrections
(∼ 10−40) escaping all existing bounds; b) an ap-
proximate rule can be to take α universal for leptons,
gauge bosons and light hadrons (pions, nucleons...)
and assume a α ∝ m−2 law for nuclei and heavier
objects, the nucleon mass setting the scale.

3. THE RELEVANCE OF COSMIC-RAY

EXPERIMENTS

If Lorentz symmetry is broken at Planck scale or
length scale, the ef-
at some other fundamental
fects of LSV may be observable well below this
energy:
they can produce detectable phenomena
at the highest observed cosmic ray energies. This
at energies above
is due to DRK [11,13,14]:
Etrans ≈ π−1/2 h1/2 (2 α)−1/4 a−1/2 m1/2 c3/2,
the very small deformation ∆ E dominates over
the mass term m2 c3 (2 p)−1 in (3) and modi-
ﬁes all kinematical balances. Because of the neg-
ative value of ∆ E , it costs more and more energy,
as energy increases above Etrans, to split the in-
coming logitudinal momentum. The parton model
(in any version), as well as standard formulae for
Lorentz contraction and time dilation, are also ex-

pected to fail above this energy [11,16] which cor-
responds to E ≈ 1020 eV for m = proton mass
and α a2 ≈ 10−72 cm2 (f.i. α ≈ 10−6 and a =
Planck length), and to E ≈ 1018 eV for m = pion
mass and α a2 ≈ 10−67 cm2 (f.i. α ≈ 0.1 and a
= Planck length). Assuming that the earth moves
slowly with respect to the absolute rest frame (the
”vacuum rest frame”), these eﬀects lead to observ-
able phenomena in future experiments devoted to
the highest-energy cosmic-rays:

a) For α a2 > 10−72 cm2 , and assuming a
universal value of α , there is no Greisen-Zatsepin-
Kuzmin cutoﬀ for the particles under consideration
and cosmic rays (e.g. protons) from anywhere in the
presently observable Universe can reach the earth.
b) With the same hypothesis, unstable particles
with at least two stable particles in the ﬁnal states of
all their decay channels become stable at very high
energy. Above Etrans, the lifetimes of all unstable
the π0 in cascades) become much
particles (e.g.
longer than predicted by relativistic kinematics.

c) In astrophysical processes at very high en-
ergy, similar mechanisms can inhibit radiation un-
der external forces, GZK-like cutoﬀs, decays, pho-
todisintegration of nuclei, momentum loss through
collisions, production of lower-energy secondaries...
potentially contributing to solve all basic problems
raised by the highest-energy cosmic rays.

d) With the same hypothesis, the allowed ﬁnal-
state phase space of two-body collisions is mod-
iﬁed and can lead to a sharp fall of cross-
sections for incoming cosmic ray energies above
Elim ≈ (2 π)−2/3 (ET a−2 α−1 h2 c2)1/3, where
ET is the energy of the target. As a consequence,
and with the previous ﬁgures for Lorentz symmetry
violation, above some energy Elim between 1022
and 1024 eV a cosmic ray will not deposit most of
its energy in the atmosphere and can possibly fake
an exotic event with much less energy.

e) Eﬀects a) to d) are obtained using only DRK.
If dynamical anomalies are added (failure, at very
small distance scales, of the parton model and of the
standard Lorentz formulae for length and time...),
we can expect much stronger eﬀects in the cascade
development proﬁles of cosmic-ray events.

f) Cosmic superluminal particles would produce
atypical events with very small total momentum,
isotropic or involving several jets [10,12,15,16].

Abstract

Reformulation of Dirac equation in terms of real quadratic division
algebra of quaternions is given. Similar equations with diﬀerent mass
term are identiﬁed as suitable for description of free propagating quark
motion. The complete orthonormal set of the positive-energy plane
wave solutions is presented. Therefore, Zitterbewegung phenomenon is
absent in this formulation. The probability current is proportional to
the momentum, as in standard Schr¨odinger wave mechanics.

Introduction

In this paper I will discuss an old, well-known and apparently “insigniﬁcant”
problem that lies in the foundation of the relativistic quantum mechanics or,
more precisely, in the foundation of the quantum electrodynamics. A story
starts with the celebrated paper of P.A.M. Dirac [1] that describes relativistic
motion of a free propagating electron, and had tremendous success of natural
explanation of spin, correct non-relativistic limit, correct coupling with the
external magnetic ﬁeld, correct gyromagnetic ratio and, ﬁnally, prediction
of positron.

The mathematical formalism used requires presence of the negative ki-
netic energy states in order to obtain the complete orthonormal set of the
linearly independent fundamental solutions of the suggested equation. In-
deed, such states do not make sense from the physical point of view.

Since the Dirac equation is written in the Hamiltonian form, it allows us
to work in the Heisenberg representation and determine directly whether or
not a given observable is a constant of motion. Then we ﬁnd, for example,
that the momentum is a conserved quantity as it should be. However, the
orbital momentum, as well as the spin, are not conserved separately and
only the sum of them is a constant of motion. Conventionally, the spin is
associated with the internal degree of freedom of the electron and therefore
apparently has nothing to do with isotropy of the space-time continuum
(indeed, if we assign to the quantum mechanical space-time point internal
algebraic structure, then this will be rather naturally expected result). Even
more surprising result [2] is obtained if we consider velocity ˙~x in the Dirac
formulation. Instantaneous group velocity of the electron has only values
c in spite of the non-zero rest mass of electron. In addition, velocity of a

±
free moving electron is not a constant of motion.

An analytic solution for the coordinate operator of a free propagating
electron was found by E. Schr¨odinger [3]. It turns out that in addition to
the uniform rectilinear motion consistent with the classical electrodynamics,
the Dirac electron executes oscillatory motion, which E. Schr¨odinger called
Zitterbewegung. Let us recall that entire non-relativistic quantum mechanics
was raised in order to explain the absence of radiation during the oscillatory
motion of the electron bounded by the electric potential of the nucleus.
Therefore, the Dirac theory of electron contains a deﬁnite prediction that the
free moving electron will loose all a kinetic energy through electromagnetic
radiation [4].

It is rather surprising that the Zitterbewegung Problem attracted only
sporadic [5, 6] attention during years of development of the theory of quan-
tum ﬁelds and eﬀorts to achieve the uniﬁcation of all fundamental interac-
tions. It was demonstrated [6, 7] that the Zitterbewegung oscillations are
due solely to interference between the positive- and negative- energy com-
ponents in the wave packet. The Zitterbewegung is completely absent for
a wave packet made up exclusively of positive energy plane wave solutions.
It is clear from the above analysis that if one achieves the reformulation of
the Dirac equation such that the complete orthonormal set of linearly inde-
pendent solutions will contain only positive energy states then the Zitterbe-
wegung oscillations will disappear. Indeed, the charge-conjugated solutions,
associated with the positron, must be retained.

It has been known for a long time that the algebraic structure of Dirac
equation is closely related to the quadratic normal division algebra of quater-
nions. Here we suggest a quaternionic reformulation of the Dirac equations
[8], as well as an additional set of similar equations suitable for description of
the free propagating quark motion. The main eﬀort is made to obtain equa-
tions with the intrinsic SU (2)
U (1) local gauge invariance. In contrast
with the approach of S.L. Adler and others [9, 10], we consider the possibil-
ity that the previously obtained quaternionic extension [11] of the Hilbert
space description of quantum ﬁelds represents a consistent mathematical
framework for the electroweak uniﬁcation scheme (a brief summary of rele-
vant results is given in the Appendix). It is obvious that in order to achieve
uniﬁcation of all fundamental interactions, the algebraic extension beyond
the quaternions is needed. We demonstrate that mathematical structure
of the obtained equations of motion suggests that the required extension
may proceed through wave functions which possess three and seven phases,
whereas the scalar product remains complex. In that case the examples of
nonextendability to octonionic quantum mechanics [9] are not valid.

2 Equations of motion for fundamental fermions

Let us consider the algebraic structure of the Dirac equation. The problem
is to achieve factorization of the energy-momentum relation

in such a way, that the correspondent Hamiltonian is the generator of
Abelian translations in time, which is expressed by the Schr¨odinger equation

E2 = p2c2 + m2c4

i~ ∂ψ
∂t

= Hψ.

(1)

(2)

It was demonstrated by P.A.M. Dirac [1] that in terms of the two-
dimensional commutative quadratic division algebra of complex numbers
no solution can be found. The problem requires intrinsically an extension
of the algebraic basis of the theory. The Dirac’s solution of the problem,

i~ ∂ψ

=

~c

∂xj −

β mc2 ψ

Hψ,

j = 1, 2, 3

uses the generators of the C4 Cliﬀord algebra:

αiαk + αkαi = 2δik
αiβ + βαi = 0
i = β2 = 1.
α2

i, k = 1, 2, 3

(4)

However, such a drastic growth in algebra is only apparent. The true
physical content of the obtained result is expressed more distinctly if (3) is
written in the following form:

i

by the reason, which will be explained below).

In a precise analogy with the physical content of Maxwell’s equations,
we again have to deal with two mutually connected waves, which propagate
together in a space with constant velocity.

Now, the full basis of the certain algebra (C2 Cliﬀord algebra) is symmet-
rically used in (5). However, it is assumed that i in (5) commutes with σi,
that is the algebra is deﬁned over the ﬁeld of complex numbers. Therefore,
the algebraic foundation of this formulation is based on an eight-dimensional
non-division algebra. In addition, it is customary in the applications to con-
tinue working with complex numbers as an abstract algebra, but for the C2
Cliﬀord algebra, one makes use of a representation (Pauli matrices) intro-
ducing into the theory an asymmetry, which has neither mathematical nor
physical justiﬁcation.

Now, I will demonstrate that the algebraic foundation of (5) may be
reduced to a four-dimensional real quadratic division algebra of quaternions

and that the structure of Dirac equations is intrinsically connected with the
functional-analytical structures mentioned above.

Here we are forced to consider masses as given phenomenological param-
eters. If m1 6
= 0, the presence of this additional term does not increase the
number of fundamental plane wave solutions of the equations (11). There-
fore, we will consider the equations (11) with m1 = 0 as a separate inde-
pendent set and in order to maintain the direct connection with the Dirac
equations, will neglect the m2 term in the presence of the non-vanishing m1
term.

The form (13) is very convenient for the investigation of gauge invariance
group of the Dirac equations. The U (1) gauge invariance group from the
right is generated by the transformations

ψ′ = ψ z, φ′ = φ z

z = a + bi,

= 1, a, b are real numbers.

Since for every pair of solutions (ψ, φ) of the linear diﬀerential equations,
(ψa, φa) (a is a real number) is also a solution, it is always enough to show
that the particular transformation

ψ′ = ψ i

φ′ = φ i

(i.e. a = 0,

b = 1)

(15)

leaves the equations invariant.

Invariance of the equations (13) with respect to this transformation is
obvious. Let us consider what is a left gauge invariance group of the Dirac
equations. Remember that (13) are the equations for free propagating waves
and thus admit solutions of the form

Therefore, the U (1) transformations

It is assumed in the Dirac equations [13], that

(cid:21)

(22)

[i, ej] = 0,

j = 1, 2, 3

and hence the obtained gauge invariance group is U (1)
U (1). Now it be-
comes clear why the Dirac equations allow us to incorporate an additional
charge [14] and turn out to be suitable for the realization of the electroweak

⊗

uniﬁcation scheme [15] without contradiction with the Aharonov-Bohm ef-
fect [16].

However, the group-theoretical content of this scheme [15], side by side
with the functional-analytical structures [11], suggests that the left gauge
invariance group should be larger (at least U (1; q) ∼= SU (2)) and should
not contain an Abelian invariant subgroup. The simplest way to satisfy
these requirements is to identify the Abelian groups (14) and (17) discussed
above, that is to attach to the Dirac equations the following form:

1

ej =

−

j = 1, 2, 3

(24)

and to drop the assumption (23). Then the algebraic foundation of the
theory is reduced to a four-dimensional real quadratic division algebra of
quaternions.

The U (1) right gauge invariance of the equations (24) may be main-

tained if

i =

e1p1 + e2p2 + e1e2p3
~p
|
|

(25)

and may be demonstrated exactly in the same way as (18) - (22).

Consequently, we have obtained the additional meaning for i, which ap-
pears originally in the Schr¨odinger equation. An algebra itself forms a vector
space, and the basis of algebra constitutes a suitable set of orthogonal axes
in that space, for example, a complex algebra may be considered as a two-
dimensional plane with the orthogonal directions 1 and i.
In that space
i standing in the left-hand side of the Schr¨odinger equation deﬁne the di-
rection of the time translations, which form an Abelian group. Therefore,
the U (1) right gauge invariance of the equations (24) leads us to the con-
clusion that these equations deﬁne (the condition (25)) the direction of the
time translations at the three-dimensional quaternionic surface (the space
of quantum mechanical phases). Then, a possible physical interpretation is
that, compared with a classical relativistic particle, a quantum particle has
not only its proper time but, in addition, a proper direction of time. Per-
haps, this may serve as an explanation of why quantum equations of motion
contain the ﬁrst time derivative, whereas the classical equations of motion
are expressed in terms of the second derivative.

We investigate now how our manipulations have aﬀected the correspond-
ing solutions. As it is well known, the general solution of Dirac equation
may be formed as a linear combination of the four independent solutions,
which are four spinors with four components. Two of them are obtained for
1
E > 0 for two spin states U (1)

(cid:19)
The other two we are forced to obtain using E < 0 since there are no other
possibilities. They correspond to the arbitrary choice of U (3)

In addition, in the capacity of ej, j = 1, 2, 3, one may choose not only

the quaternion basis itself but other sets, for example,

or

ie1i,

ie2i,

ie2e1i

e1ie1,

e2ie2,

e1e2ie1e2.

Notice, however, that (47) do not form a quaternion but

e1ie1 + e2ie2 + e1e2ie1e2 = i.

Additional knowledge is required in order to deﬁne which set is relevant

and how it may be associated with the correspondent physical objects.

So far, our discussion has been restricted to the four-dimensional real
it is clear that the
quadratic division algebra of quaternions. However,
equations (24) and (35) serve in an uniform manner also the octonionic
extension of the complex Hilbert space .

If the underlying algeraic foundation of the theory is extended to include
the eight-dimensional real quadratic division algebra of octonions, then
the corresponding additional set of solutions for the equations (35) may be
obtained.

They may have, e.g., the following form:

ψ = U1 i exp −

φ = U2 exp −

i (Et

are real numbers;

(50)

and, as before, form a quaternion. This quaternion turns out to form an
algebraic foundation of the momentum space and, therefore, the algebraic
symmetry between coordinate and momentum spaces may be broken in this
formulation.

The particularly symmetric case occurs, if k = 7. Then

Based on the results of M. Zorn [17] that each automorphism of the
octonion algebra is completely deﬁned by the images of three “independent”
basis units [18], it was demonstrated by M. G¨unaydin and F. G¨ursey [19]
that under given automorphism σ we have three quaternionic planes in the
space formed by octonion algebra (space of quantum mechanical phases),
which undergo rotations by the angles φ1, φ2, φ3, respectively, such that

φ1 + φ2 + φ3 = 0 mod 2π

(53)

remains invariant. The planes (ei, ej) are determined by the conditions
eiej = ek and ek is the ﬁxed point common to all of those planes (com-
pare with (49) and (50)). These results might help to extract the set of
independent solutions and to obtain its correct classiﬁcation.

16

It is worth mentioning that an alternative arrangement can be also pos-
sible. We may consider a septet of solutions, each one associated with the
same mass, namely

ψ = U1ek exp −

φ = U2 exp −

ek (Et
~

ek (Et
~

−

~p~x)

−

and, perhaps, an additional one in the form

j7 = e7

jk = ieki
jk+3 = jek+3 j
j7 = e7

k = 1, 2, 3

(56)

k = 1, 2, 3

(57)

with the common ﬁxed point e7: i and j are given by (51).

The number of independent solutions, which are arranged in such a way,
is sharply reduced and serves as a slight reminder of a similar possibility
discussed in the literature [20].

Now it may be clariﬁed why we have chosen to discuss the Dirac equa-
tions in the Weyl representation. The reason is merely technical. In order
to perform clean octonionic calculations, we assume that the solutions of
the equations (35) have the form (36), where U1 and U2 are real numbers.
Then the obtained relations (43) justify the assumption. Notice that the
electroweak uniﬁcation scheme [15] is based on the use of this representa-
tion of the Dirac equations; in addition, in that case the solutions behave
naturally with respect to the Lorentz transformations.

Let us demonstrate that the Dirac equations in the form (24), as well
as the set (35), permit a consistent probabilistic interpretation (here the
discussion is restricted to the case where the underlying algebraic basis are
quaternions).

3 Conclusion

In account of the experimental information that became available during
the

last century, it is desirable for the equations of motion for the fundamen-

tal fermions to have the following properties:
- the equations should possess SU (2)

U (1) local gauge invariance
intrinsically since the electron is not a source of pure electromagnetic
radiation but also has the ability to participate in weak interactions;
- the electron is the only particular member of the entire family of fun-
damental fermions, it is desirable that all fermions are described in the
uniform manner;

⊗

- there exist three replication of the families of the fundamental fermions;
- leptons do not have a color;
- quarks do have a color;
- each quark appear in triplet associated with the same mass;
- a color is associated with the internal degree of freedom;
- a color symmetry can’t be broken.

In contrast to the existing quaternionic formulations [9, 10] of the Dirac
equation, we suggested here closely related but essentially diﬀerent sets
of equations that allow description of the free motion for electron and
neutrinos, as well as triplets of quarks. The suggested solution possesses
SU (2)
U (1) local gauge invariance intrinsically. All obtained solutions
have the structure (A1) and (A2). These solutions are substantially diﬀerent
from the standard ones and may yield, therefore, diﬀerent values for observ-
able physical quantities. We propose to compare and verify them against the
existing experimental information. The suggested reexamination may help
to decide what is a relevant mathematical framework suitable to achieve a
solution of the uniﬁcation problem for the fundamental interactions.

20

During the last decades, an enormous progress in the understanding
of quantum theory of ﬁelds took place.
It became almost apparent that
we have to deal with four essentially fundamental interactions, which have
a similar origin, namely, presence of phases in the quantum mechanical
description of the fundamental sources of these ﬁelds [21]. In addition, the
investigation of the properties of the fundamental sources (leptons, quarks)
clearly established that the quantum numbers in addition to electric charge
(week hypercharge and color) appear in amazing correspondence with the
complex variety of the radiated ﬁelds.

The formulation of classical mechanics and the classical theory of ﬁelds
have demonstrated that the presence of additional interactions requires a
suitable generalization of the mathematical language used. Application of
the analogy with the structure of classical physics in the framework of func-
tional analysis naturally concentrated around attempts to extent it on all
Hurwitz algebras, as the underlying algebraic foundation of the theory.

The above discussion may be considered as an additional step towards
realization of a program initiated by E. Schr¨odinger [22] to treat all of the
physics as wave mechanics:

a) The universal mathematical architecture of the physics is given in
terms of ten functional - analytical frameworks, suitable to incorporate the
results of physical measurements.

Real, complex, quaternion and octonion states with real scalar product
should be equivalent to the theory of classical ﬁelds. Uniﬁcation of elec-
tromagnetism with gravitation should occur already in the classical ﬁeld
theory.

Complex, quaternion and octonion states with complex scalar product
should allow realization of present uniﬁcation schemes. Notice that pure
relativistic quantum electrodynamics does not exist because there are no
elementary sources of pure electromagnetic radiation. Neutrino is an ele-
mentary source of pure weak radiation.

Quaternion and octonion states with quaternion scalar product should

describe wave mechanics of space-time continuum.

Octonion states with octonion scalar product should allow ultimate re-

alization of idea of elementary particles picture of natural phenomena.

b) One expects that the quantum mechanical space-time continuum
should be diﬀerent from its classical counterpart. Perhaps, the spin is not
a dynamical variable, but the feature of the quantum mechanical world,
namely, the world point is described by the following expression (before
inclusion of quantum gravity):

X =

(cid:18)

t
e1x + e2y + e3z

e1x

−

−

e3z

e2y
t

−

(cid:19)

It is interesting to construct the correspondent metric space and the
application of Least Action should lead to the equations of motion for the
fundamental fermions.

c) In the present discussion we consider masses as external phenomeno-
logical parameters. However, the structure of octonion quantum mechanics
with complex scalar product suggest natural mechanism to generate masses
of the fundamental fermions as energy gaps obtained after splitting states
of initially degenerated two-level physical system.

Appendix

This paper is concerned with the relativistic dynamics of single particle
states and for this reason we have used only the following results of the
particular realization of this program for the quaternionic and octonionic
Hilbert spaces with complex scalar products:

where f = f0 +

fiei; f0, fi are real functions of the space-time

coordinates and ei , i = 1, ..., 7 are a basis for the real quadratic division
algebra of octonions.

The e1 and e7 in the deﬁnition of the states (A1) and (A2) play the role
of a label for the generator of a complex ﬁeld in the space of one-body states.
For example, any one of the quaternionic units or some linear combination
of them

i =

ae1 + be2 + ce3
√a2 + b2 + c2

(a, b, c are arbitrary real numbers) may be used for this purpose. Thus, a
deﬁnition of this combination cannot be obtained kinematically and turns
out to be a matter of the dynamics of single particle states.

2) Consider the general form of operators, induced by the structure (A1)

of the vector space.

For the complex linear operators

Az =

a11 a12
a21 a22 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

where matrix elements aij are real operators over quaternions and, in turn,
are assumed to be at least z-linear operators, we have

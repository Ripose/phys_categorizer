Abstract

We show that results obtained in paper Foundations of Physics 33, No. 7, 1107
(2003), are not correct.

In a recent paper [1], R. G. Beil claims to have derived electromagnetism from the
so called Finsler geometry. However, this result contradicts one of the results of [2],
where it is shown that electromagnetism can not be geometrized in the framework
of Riemannian geometry with any metrics. Because Finsler geometry is Riemannian
geometry with Finsler metric [3], electromagnetism cannot be geometrized in the its
framework too.

In the present paper we demonstrate that results obtained in [1] are not correct. In
section 4 of [1], R. G. Beil, after choosing matrix (52) gets connection of Riemannian
geometry (59)

Then he imposes condition (60)-(61) on ﬁeld B

∂xµ (Bνυν) = 0.

Using this condition and (59) he represents equation of motion

Next, R. G. Beil compares (62) with equation of motion

(2)

(63)

(3)

dυλ

mc

Fµλυµ = 0

and claims that

Fµλ =

∂Bλ
∂xµ

− ∂Bµ
∂xλ .

Fµλυµ = (

∂Bλ
∂xµ

− ∂Bµ

∂xλ )υµ.

This claim is not correct because by comparing (62) with (2) we obtain

Basic solutions to this equation cannot be (63) because υµ are not independent due
to condition (60). In order to solve (3) we have to count condition (60) which gives
Fµλ = ∂Bλ
∂xµ . (63) is a linear combination of these basic solutions. Note that linear
∂xµ + ∂Bµ
combination of basic solutions in the form ∂Bλ
∂xλ is also a solution to (3) because
of (60).

After (63), R. G. Beil claims that Fµλ can be identiﬁed with electromagnetic ﬁeld.
However, any tensor in the form of (63) can not be identiﬁed with electromagnetic
ﬁeld, because in order Fµλ to be identiﬁed with electromagnetic ﬁeld it must satisfy
Maxwell equations ∂µFµλ = 0.

From the physical point of view condition (60) is not acceptable for electromagnetic
ﬁeld and charged particles, because it expresses charge of a particle as a function of its
velocity and electromagnetic potential. It is very well known that charge of a particle
depends neither on its velocity nor on the potential of external electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Also, (60) gives electromagnetic potential as a function of inverse velocities, which is
not acceptable as was pointed out in [2].

We also would like to note that the so called Finsler geometry is not a geometry
diﬀerent from Riemannian geometry. It is actually Riemannian geometry with the so
called Finsler metric (see for example [3]). R. G. Beil (as many authors) uses notions
of Finsler geometry and Finsler metric interchangeably.

I would like to stress that as it is proven in [2], Riemannian geometry with any metric
is not suitable for geometrization of electromagnetism because there is no equivalence
principle for electromagnetic interaction.

Finally, in sec. 5, R. G. Beil states that metric with explicit appearance of e/m is
introduced by G. Randers. However, this is not the case. In his work [4], G. Randers
considered Riemannian geometry with metric without any coeﬃcients. Metric and new
geometries with explicit appearance of e/m have been introduced in [2].

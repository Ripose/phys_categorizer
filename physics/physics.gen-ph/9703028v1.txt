Recently several authors found additional solutions to relativistic wave equations. Here

they are listed:

• E = 0 solution of the Maxwell’s j = 1 equations [1] which was found on the basis of
the consideration of the characteristic equation (in the momentum representation).

• B(3) Evans-Vigier ﬁeld [2], which was obtained as a cross-product of the transverse

modes of electromagnetism: B(1) × B(2) = iB(0)B(3) ∗ and cyclic.

• Non plane-wave solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation [3a,b] by M´unera et al., which
were obtained by using unconventional basis functions and “coupling anzatz”, see [3a,
Eqs. (11,12)].

• M´unera and Guzm´an generalized solution of Maxwell’s equations in terms of poten-

tials [3c,d].

• Chubykalo and Smirnov-Rueda ‘method of separated potentials’, ref. [4], which permits
us to consider a function with implicit dependence on time as full-value solution of the
Maxwell’s (and/or D’Alembert) equations.

Why did so many new unexpected solutions appear at once? Let us look at this issue by

using ordinary methods of solving the system of partial diﬀerential equations [5,6].

It is well known that the set of dynamical Maxwell’s equations are equivalent to the

following set, e.g., [7, Eqs.(4.21,4.22)]:1

∇ × [E + iB] − i(∂/∂t)[E + iB] = 0 ,
∇ × [E − iB] + i(∂/∂t)[E − iB] = 0 .

(1a)
(1b)

This is a system of partial diﬀerential equations. It is easy to see that the second equation
is just the parity conjugate (x → −x) of the ﬁrst one if one uses ordinary interpretation of
E, a vector, and B, an axial vector.

In the framework of this paper we shall look for solutions of (1a) in the generalized form2

A ≡ E + iB ∼ a exp(λt + κ · r)

,

where λ and κ are some unknown parameters, which provide characteristic polynomio, and
a = column(a1 a2
a3) is some constant vector, which is deﬁned by the boundary and/or
normalization conditions. Thus, at the moment we are not going to restrict our consideration
by the plane waves. As a result of the use of the method of characteristic polynomio for the
diﬀerential equation

with (Ji)jk = −iǫijk, we obtain the algebraic equation for parameters λ and κ:

[(∂/∂t) + J · ∇]ijAj = 0

,

Det[λ + (J · κ)]ij = 0 .

1Issues related with the source equations will be discussed in detail elsewhere.

2More rigorous consideration will be reported in the extended version.

It has solutions λ = 0 and λ = ± | κ |. In fact, we repeated the procedure of ref. [1], but
standing at the most general position we do not know yet, how λ and κ are connected with
energy and momentum. Thus, the general solution of the ﬁrst Maxwell equation (1a) may
be presented, for instance, in the form:

E + iB = A1 exp[α1(| κ | t + κ · r)] + A2 exp[α2(− | κ | t + κ · r)] + A3 exp[α3(κ · r)]

,

(4)

with the complex vectors A1, A2 and A3 and the constants αi to be deﬁned from normaliza-
tion and boundary conditions. We have several remarks: a) The plane waves are obtained
only if associate λ = ±iE and κ = ±ik, what is not obligatory.
It becomes clear that
the Maxwell equations may describe physical states which are diﬀerent from plane waves,
so that the hypothesis on the quanta of light waves may be regarded as a particular case
only, cf. [3a,4]; b) The solution with λ = 0 enters in the general solution of the system of
diﬀerential equations. It may be removed only by means of the special choice of boundary
conditions; c) In general, κ can be substituted by −κ (an analog of the space inversion
transformation in the momentum representation), i.e. the solution can be written in several
forms, which should be equivalent in the physical content; d) In the same way one can ﬁnd
the general solution of the second equation (1b).

While one can analyze these issues further (and more rigorously) we stop here in order
to be possible to publish an extended version elsewhere and because of volume restrictions
of the journal. But, below we shall show that non-plane-wave solutions of the Maxwell’s
equations, arise also from diﬀerent viewpoint [2], they are not zero and that the ﬁeld related
with these unusual modes may be irrotational under certain conditions. Firstly, we write
particular plane-wave solutions of the Maxwell’s equations in the form3

A(r) =

ei(ωt−k·r)

, B(r) =

e−i(ωt−k·r)

with the objects a = column(a1

being the constant vectors with respect to the space inversion operation. In order to form
an axial vector one should add the space-inverted vectors to the deﬁned ones.4 Thus, we
obtain

We shall further prove the following theorems:

sin(k · r)e−i(ωt−π/2)

.

(6b)

3Here and below the notation may have nothing to do with the accustomed notation for the
vectors of electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

4We still work in the coordinate representation and want to form an axial vector with respect
r → −r. We do not bother the properties of the vectors with respect to k → −k.

Theorem 1. The quantity F = C × D conserves in time:

∂
∂t

F = 0 .

Proof. By the straightforward calculation one can ﬁnd the explicit form of the axial

vector F. Here it is:

(7)

(8)

F =

a2b3 − a3b2
a3b1 − a1b3
a1b2 − a2b1











sin2(k · r)

.

By deﬁnition the a and b are the constant vectors. Thus, Eq. (8) contains no dependence
on the time t, so ∂F

∂t = 0. Theorem is proven.

Theorem 2. If A and B chosen in the form (5) satisfy the Maxwell’s equations (1a,1b)
respectively (or vice versa), the quantity F = C × D a) is irrotational; b) satisﬁes both
equations (1a) and (1b); c) is zero in all space if and only if A or B is zero.

Proof. In order to prove a) and b) it is suﬃciently to prove that (J · ∇)ijFj = 0 because
of the operator identity ∇× ≡ curl, the deﬁnition of the j = 1 matrices and thanks to the
proven Theorem 1. By direct calculations one comes to

(J · ∇)ijFj = i∇ × F = i sin 2(k · r) {k × [a × b]} ≡

≡ i sin 2(k · r) {a(k · b) − b(k · a)} ≡
≡ i sin 2(k · r) {a × [k × b] − b × [k × a]}

.

(9)

After using the Maxwell’s equations (1a,1b) one ﬁnds k×a = −iωa and k×b = +iωb.5 Sub-
stituting these relations to (9) we are convinced that F is irrotational and, thus, combining
this statement with the previous one (conservation of F in time) we prove that the quantity
F satisﬁes both Maxwell’s equations (1a) and (1b). Following the accustomed terminology
it can be named as “longitudinal”.

Let us now assume that F = 0 in all the space. If a 6= 0 and b 6= 0 this can occur only
if a × b = 0 for the propagating wave states. By deﬁnitions they are complex vectors. So,
if denote c = ℜe a, d = ℑm a, e = ℜe b and f = ℑm b we can deduce that in order the
searched cross product would be equal to zero it is necessary

c × e = +d × f

, d × e = −c × f

,

(10)

Let us ﬁrstly consider the case when c and e are not collinear, d and f are not collinear, i.e.
the ﬁrst relation is not equal to zero. It can be fulﬁlled if and only if the real vectors c, d,
e and f are all coplanar. Thus, let us choose two vectors c and d, which are implied to be
linear independent, then other two can be expanded as follows

e = a11c + a12d ,

f = a21c + a22d

with real coeﬃcients aij. Considering c × e and d × f we are convinced that the quantity
a12 = −a21. Considering the second equation in (10) we are convinced that a11 = a22. Thus,

5If imply that A is a particular solution of (1b) and B is a particular solution of (1a) we would
have opposite signs in the written relations.

4

b = e + if = (a11 − ia12)(c + id) and, hence, b ∼ c1eiβa. We have a contradiction with
the statement that A and B, which are not phase free, satisfy diﬀerent Maxwell’s equations
(1a) and (1b). Next, if d = λc from the set (10) we deduce that this can occur if and only
if λ2 = −1 what is again in contradiction with the fact that c, d, e and f are real vectors.
Finally, if c = λ1e and, then, d = λ2f one deduces:

d × e = λ2f × e = −λ1e × f

and, therefore, λ1 = λ2 = λ. Again, b ∼ (1/λ)a and one has a contradiction with the
conditions of the theorem. So, using the method of “from the inverse statement” we can say
that a × b cannot be equal to zero and, hence, F 6= 0. The end of the proof.

Theorem 3. If A and B are solutions of the same equations (1a) or (1b) and ω = ± | k |,
one can deduce the following relation for the axial vector F and the corresponding polar
curl F:

Proof. The theorem is proving by the direct calculations. One has

curl (curlF) + 4∇2F = 0 .

∇ × F = ∓4iω cot(k · r)F .

The signs depend on whether A and B satisfy simultaneously the ﬁrst equation (1a), the
sign is “−”, or the second one, the sign is “+”. Next,

∇2F = 2k2 cos 2(k · r) [a × b] = 2k2 cos 2(k · r)
sin2(k · r)

F ,

and, if one takes into account (8,12),

∇ × (∇ × F) = −8ω2 cos 2(k · r)
sin2(k · r)

F .

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

Substituting these equations in (11) we are convinced in the validity of the theorem. It is
necessary to stress that Eq. (11) is a relation, which was obtained after taking into account
certain constraints between k, a, b and ω. It cannot be considered as a dynamical equation.
This is due to the operator identity curl curl ≡ grad div − ∇2. If we rewrite (11) with
taking into account this identity we are convinced that the corresponding equation does not
have solutions unless F = const, and/or k · r = ± π

4 , ± 3π

4 . . ., or k ≡ 0.

The conclusion is:

the Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory looked by a mathemati-
cian/theoretical physicist glance has richer structure comparing with views believed since
the proposal of quantum ﬁeld nature of the light. In the recent series of the papers (see
for references [8]) we analyzed its shortcomings and advantages comparing with the more
general Weinberg formalism [7]. The question, whether the former is equivalent to the latter,
is still required further rigorous elaboration.

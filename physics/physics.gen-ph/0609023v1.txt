SUMMARY

The inﬂuence of the relativistic motion of the reference frame on the light reﬂec-
tion law is investigated. The method is based on applying the relativistic aberration
aﬀect for three light signals:
incident, normal and reﬂected rays. The form of the
reﬂection law in the moving reference frame is substantially modiﬁed and includes an
additional parameter which is the velocity vector of the reference frame. It is shown
that the reﬂected ray, as measured by a moving observer, would not in general be in
the same plane as the incident and normal rays.

A general method to transform the form of any rigid surface in 3-dimensional
space with respect to the arbitrary directed relative motion of the reference frame is
detailed. This method is based on the light signals processes and the invariance of
the light velocity under Lorentz transformations. It is shown that a moving observer
will measure a plane surface as a hyperboloid. That observer will also measure a
spherical surface as an ellipsoid. A right line in the plane is seen by a moving observer
as a hyperbola.

The whole analysis is extended to the case of a uniform media.

Key words: the light reﬂection law, Lorentz transformation, aberration, moving mirror, rigid
body, special relativity.

Introduction and overview

The main idea of the present work is to follow the role of the relativistic aberration eﬀect
on the light reﬂection law4. This will result in answering the question: What is the form of
the light reﬂection law to be used by a moving observer? The answer is of interest beyond the
academic since it has always been assumed that the light reﬂection law is the same irrespective
of the notion of the reﬂecting mirror. But this is not necessarily true.

The problem is old [1] and has many aspects (we plan to review them elsewhere [1-97]). In
recent years in the literature have appeared a number of works in this matter. For instance, the
paper by A. Gjurchinovski [27] is started by words:

Experiments involving moving mirrors are among the most interesting experiments encoun-
tered in physics. Michelson’s apparatus for measuring the speed of light with a rotating wheel
consisting of mirrored edges, an array of corner mirrors on the Moon’s surface for estimating
the distance between the Earth and the Moon, the Michelson and Morley interferometer for de-
tecting the ether , and the rotating Sagnac interferometer for determining the angular velocity
of the Earth are just a few experiments in which moving mirrors have had prominent roles. In
most textbooks that discuss these experiments, it is implicitly assumed that the ordinary law of
reﬂection of light is valid, that is, the angles of incidence and reﬂection are equal. Our goals
in this paper are to show that the ordinary law of reﬂection does not hold when the mirror is
moving at a constant velocity and to ﬁnd a correct relation between the incident and the reﬂected
angle.

In general points, our approach coincides with that used by A. Einstein a century ago [1].
Einstein considered the oblique incidence of a light ray on a perfectly reﬂecting mirror whose
velocity was directed perpendicularly to its surface. To derive the equation of the angle of
reﬂection Einstein transformed with the help of Lorentz formulas the equations describing the
reﬂection in the reference frame where the mirror was at rest.

The speciﬁcity of this particular case is that the normal direction is the same for observers at
rest and at motion. Therefore, the problem of deriving the mathematical form of the reﬂection
law in the moving reference frame reduces to relativistic aberration eﬀect for two light rays,
incident and reﬂected.

In a general case this cannot be so: the surface normal can be oriented arbitrarily with
respect to the direction of the motion of the reference frame. Besides, the problem must be
stated in a 3-dimensional space and for any surface.

In contrast to the author of [27] – ... the angle φ (the inclination angle of the ﬂat mirror
in the rest reference frame) is the real physical quantity, which, by itself, has nothing to do with
relativity ... – we have accepted an opposite view. Indeed, if we consider only the rotations
of the rest reference frame then we must rotate correspondingly the vector n of the surface
normal. In the same manner, this vector n of the surface normal must be changed with respect
to relativistic motion as well.
In the mathematics of relativistic physics there do not exist
any quantities that behave as 3-vectors under Euclidian rotation that will also be scalar under
Lorentz transformations.

For a logical starting point we have chosen to deﬁne a light ray as a physical representative
for the normal to the surface in the rest reference frame. This method from the very beginning
contains a logical deﬁciency: in the rest reference frame one can take any of two light signals:
the normal vector n related with the light going normally from the surface, and the inverse

n associated with the light signal going to the surface. We have examined both of

In that formulating, the problem of the light reﬂection law in the moving reference frame is
reduced to examining the details of the relativistical aberration eﬀect for a triple of light velocity
vectors. All analysis of the present paper is based only on the kinematics of relativity, that is
on Lorentz transformations and the exclusive properties of the the light velocity under them.
We have sought to give a complete treatment of the problem so that the reader may see many
details that may have been regarded as evident and well-known.

Below we give a short overview of the content by Sections 2-19.
In Section 2, the process of reﬂecting the light signal on an inclined mirror in the rest

reference frame K ′, for the simplest plan problem

y′ = b + kx′

(1)

(2)

is stated in terms of a set of relativistic events. The normal to the inclined (ﬂat) mirror is
modeled by a light signal going normally from the mirror. In Section 3 with the help of Lorentz
formulas the coordinates of the above set of events in a moving reference frame K are found.

In Section 4, the light reﬂection law in this simplest ﬂat arrangement, is given in the moving

reference frame

sin αi + V (sin α

sin φ2)

sin αr + V (sin α

sin φ3)

(1 + V cos φ2)

(1 + V cos φ3)

−

.

It is shown that the modiﬁed form of the law, though being rather complicated, proves its
invariance under the Lorentz transformations.

In Section 5, we turn to describing the geometrical form of the inclined mirror in the moving
reference frame K. With the inclined ﬂat mirror in the rest reference frame K ′, for the moving
observer K can be associated a set of space-time events, each of those is an arrival of a light signal
emitted from the space-time point (0; 0, 0) toward the mirror with diﬀerent angles. Evidently,
all such events will take place on the surface of the mirror but at diﬀerent times. These time
variable can be excluded and a new equation ϕ(x, y) = 0 is derived, which should be considered
as an equation describing the geometrical form of the mirror for the moving observer K.
It
should be emphasized that a deﬁnite and practically realizable procedure with the use of light
signals in the reference frame K underlies this equation ϕ(x, y) = 0.

In Section 6 we show that the given equation ϕ(x, y) = 0 represents a second order curve

that can be translated to the canonical form by the use of a rotation and a shift. In this way,
we show that the geometrical form of the mirror is a hyperbola.

In Section 7, we are to extend the results of the Section 3 to a vector form. The incident,
normal, and reﬂected light rays in the rest reference frame K ′ are described by respective vectors

mations. The reﬂection law in the K ′ can be written as

much more details of the Lorentz group theory in the book [17]). With the notation V =

In the Section 9, a special attention is given to one other aspect of the problem.

In the
rest reference frame K ′ three vectors a, n, b belong to the same single plane, but for a moving
observer it is not so. To describe this phenomenon, we have introduced the following quantity
(the volumes of the light parallelepiped [ n (a

In Section 10 we turn to examining the form of the reﬂection surface, the plane in the rest

reference frame (d is a normal to the plane)

S′ :

x′ d′ + D = 0 ,

in the moving reference frame K. For this with the reﬂection plane is associated the following
set of space-time events:

S′ :

⇒

n

t′ = √x

.

This set of events can be readily transformed to the moving reference frame, which after excluding
the time-variable provides us with a new surface equation

Take notice than only when ed = 0 takes place, then the plane in the rest frame will look as
the plane in the moving reference frame too. For all other cases the plane does not preserve its
geometrical form and is a second order surface.

In Section 11 a canonical form of this second order surface has been established with the use
of a special rotation and a shift. It turns to be a hyperboloid. Its symmetry axis is directed
along the vector

In Section 12, the geometrical form of the (plane) circle in the rest reference frame has been

transformed to the moving observer, it proves to be the ellipse

In Section 13, a 3-dimensional problem is solved: the sphere in the rest reference frame, being
transformed to the moving reference frame, becomes an ellipsoid

its symmetry axis is directed along the vector V.

In Section 14, we turn to the case when the light ray (incident, reﬂected, and normal) are
propagated in a uniform media with the refraction index n > 1. In the rest reference frame K ′
the reﬂection law preserves its form. However, there arise diﬀerences when going to a moving
reference frame K. The fact of the most signiﬁcance is that when using ordinary (vacuum-based)
Lorentz transformations then because the speed of light in the rest media is less than c ( kc < c)
the modulus of the light velocity vector does not preserve its value.

General mathematical form of the reﬂection law in the moving reference frame formally stays
the same, however one must take into account that the lengths of the vectors involved a, b, n
are diﬀerent from 1. The length of the light vector in the moving reference frame in presence of
the uniform media is

It should be especially noted one other aspect of the problem: the latter equation means
that the light velocity in the reference frame K is a function of direction of the propagation
of the light. This fact is of most signiﬁcance because it changes basically the general structure
of special relativity in presence of a media. In such circumstances there appears an absolute
reference frame related to the rest media, the reference frame K ′. In the reference frame K ′,
the light velocity is an isotropic quantity that preserves its value in all space directions. In any
other reference frame, moving K, the light velocity is anisotropic – it is a function of directions.
In Section 15, some aspects the tensor formalism of 4-velocities ua are speciﬁed for the light
case. In the Section 16. some geometrical aspects of the relativistic velocity concept in terms of
the Lobachewsky 3-geometry are brieﬂy discussed [....].

In essence, here is tested the famous Einstein’s postulate on light velocity constancy: its invari-
ance under Lorentz transformations.

aberration):

With the use of the Lorentz formulas one can transform eq.(31) to the moving reference
frame. Thereby it will be obtained a generalized form of the light reﬂection on the moving
mirror.

Generally, one might expect one of the two following possibilities:

1) either equation α′

i = α′

r turns out to be invariant under the Lorentz transformation

2) or after Lorentz transformation eqs. (31) will take a modiﬁed form

and one should expect that this new equation ϕ(αi, αr; V ) = 0 is Lorentz invariant;, in other
words it is covariant under Lorentz transformation.

Now we have to carry out the calculation needed. Firstly, it will be better to re-write eqs.

The relations obtained seem rather cumbersome. Nevertheless they should be taken seriously
because they display the property of Lorentz-invariance. Such an additional test consists in the
let the frame K, in turn, be moving with the velocity ˜V with respect to another
following:
reference frame ˜K. We should expect invariance of equations (44)-(45) under corresponding
Lorentz transformations:

cos α =

cos ˜α + ˜V
1 + ˜V cos ˜α

,

cos φ2 =

cos φ3 =

cos ˜φ2 + ˜V
1 + ˜V cos ˜φ2

of the light velocity ˜V (and all other ones) it is better to employ a hyperbolic variable:

Firstly let us consider behavior of the more simple formula (45) under Lorentz transformation

1 + tanh β (cosh ˜β cos ˜φ2 + sinh ˜β) / (cosh ˜ν + sinh ˜β cos ˜φ2)

5 On describing the form of a moving mirror

Section concerns a general problem, described in [31] as follows:
As is well known, the notion of a rigid body, which proves so useful in Newtonian mechanics,
is incompatible with the existence of a universal ﬁnite upper bound for all signal velocities [Laue
- 1911 ]. As a result, the notion of a perfectly rigid body does not exist within the framework of
SR. However, the notion of a rigid motion does exist. Intuitively speaking, a body moves rigidly
if, locally, the relative spatial distances of its material constituents are unchanging .

Let us turn to the geometrical form of the mirror in unmoving reference frame K ′; it is

described by two parametric equations

x′ = L′ + l′ cos γ′ ,

y′ = l′ sin γ′ .

(54)

After evident manipulation we get to

cos γ′ = l′

where b =

y′ = b + k x′

(55)

L tan γ′ and k = tan γ′are ﬁxed parameters deﬁning the straight line – contour of

For another observer K, to the mirror there corresponds a set of space-time events of the type
(0; 0, 0)
2. Evidently, all such events will take place on the

2′, each of those is an arrival of a light signal emitted from the space-time point 1′ :
toward the mirror with diﬀerent angles φ′

Relationship (58) should be considered as an equation describing the surface of the
moving mirror, it is not evidently a straight line equation. It should be emphasized
again that a deﬁnite and practically realizable procedure with the use of light signals
in the reference frame K underlies this equation.

This is of second order curve. In order to establish its explicit geometrical form eq. (59)
should be translated to the canonical form. We will proceed in accordance with standard pro-
cedures. As a ﬁrst step let us ﬁnd certain (x, y)-rotation that will eliminate a coeﬃcient at the
cross term xy from the curve equation. To this end, instead of (x, y) one should introduce new
(rotated) variables (X ′, Y ′)

7 Generalization and simpliﬁcation, vector form

Now we are to extend the results above to a more general vector form. Let us start with the
conventional designation. The incident and reﬂected light rays in the rest reference frame K ′

are described by respective vectors of unit length a′ and b′:

a′ =

W′
in
c

′2 = 1 ,

b′ =

′2 = 1 ;

With the surface perpendicular there can be associated the unit vector n′ (normal light ray –

Fig 5. Reﬂection in the rest reference frame K ′

vector formula (all three vectors have a unit length)

To describe the same reﬂection process in the moving reference frame K means that the
relation (70) is to be transformed to this new frame through the Lorentz formula. The Lorentz

The formulas (81) can be rewritten diﬀerently with special notation for longitudinal and

(83)

Now, with general expression for Lorentz transform in hands, we may quite easily obtain
a general form of velocity addition law. Let us take two events on the trajectory of a moving
particle

the velocity vector in the reference frame K ′ is deﬁned by the relation

and

(t′

These equations provides us with mathematical form
of the reﬂection law in the moving reference frame K.

at this eq. (90) will become much simpler;

[ e(n

One may note that if four vector a, b, n, e belong the same plane (previously obtained eq.

(74) relates to just that situation) then two identities hold

(89)

(90)

(91)

(92)

Now let us perform some additional calculation that permit us to decompose the vector form
of the reﬂection law (90) into two more simple equations: one along the e vector and other
transversely to e. Indeed, forming the dot product of eq (90) and the vector e we obtain

e (a

n) + th β e [ (a

×

n)

e ] + (1

×
1 + th β (ea)

ch−1β) [ e(n

[e(n

×
1 + th β (ea)

= (1

[e(n

×
1 + th β (eb)

,

from this it follows

and further

V(n
a)
×
1 + (Va)

=

V(n
b)
×
1 + (Vb)

.

(93)

Taking this in mind , we see that in eq. (90) some terms on the left and on the right canceled
each other so we will obtain (92). More clarity may be reached with the use of symbolical vector
notation for eq. (90):

The above calculation consists of two step:

A = B .

f irst

eA = eB ,

second

A

e(eA) = B

e(eB) ; .

−

So, the light reﬂection law (90) in the moving reference
frame K may be presented with the help of two equations

[V(n

×
1 + (Va)
b
V

×

−
1 + aV

Now let us consider second (scalar) equation (71)

a′n′ + b′n′ = 0 .

From (95), with the use of (87), one gets

a + e [ sh β + (ch β

1) (e a) ]

n + e [ sh β + (ch β

1) (e n) ]

ch β + sh β (ea)

−

b + e [ sh β + (ch β

n + e [ sh β + (ch β

1) (e n) ]

ch β + sh β (eb)

−

ch β + sh β (en)

−

ch β + sh β (en)

from where after evident calculation it follows

1)ea]

bn + (b + n)e)shβ + 2(be)(ne)(chβ

chβ + shβea

+

bn + (b + n)e shβchβ + [ 1 + (en)(eb) ] sh2β
chβ + shβeb

= 0 .

(96)

Let us verify that this general formula (96) is reduced to the established result for a particular

simpler case. Indeed. let it be

e = (1, 0, 0),

a = (a1, a2, a3),

b = (b1, b2, b3)

then eq. (96) reads

(a1n1 + a2n2 + a3n3)(ch2β

(b1n1 + b2n2 + b3n3)(ch2β

+

−

sh2β) + (a1 + n1)shβchβ + (1 + a1n1) sh2β
chβ + shβa1

+

−

sh2β) + (b1 + n1)shβchβ + (1 + b1n1) sh2β
chβ + shβb1

from where it follows

(a1n1 + a2n2 + a3n3)ch2β + (a1 + n1)shβchβ + (1

(b1n1 + b2n2 + b3n3)ch2β + (b1 + n1)shβchβ + (1

chβ + shβb1

a2n2 −

−

a3n3) sh2β

b2n2 −

−

b3n3) sh2β

+

= 0

which after dividing by ch2β gives the yet known result (77):

(a1n1 + a2n2 + a3n3) + (a1 + n1)V + V 2(1

(b1n1 + b2n2 + b3n3) + (b1 + n1)V + V 2(1

+

1 + a1V

1 + b1V

a2n2 −

−

a3n3)

+

b2n2 −

−

b3n3)

= 0 .

Bearing in mind the previous analysis, eq. (96) can readily be changed to the form

an(1

V 2) + (a + n)V + [ V 2 + (aV)(nV) ]

−

1 + aV

+

+

bn + (b + n)V + [ V 2 + (bV)(nV) ]
1 + bV

= 0 ;

(97)

(98)

eq. (98) is the result of converting eq. (95) to moving reference frame.

Now let us give special attention to one other aspect of the problem under consideration. In
the starting (rest) reference frame K ′ three vectors a, n, b belong to the same single plane, as a

32

result one can derive a decomposition of b into a linear combination of two remaining vectors:

ch β + sh β (eb)

It should be especially noted that the general structure of the relation obtained is

b = A a + B n + C e ;

we see that there appears a constituent along e direction which means that the vector b (reﬂected
light ray) is not situated in the plane of vectors a and n.

In general, eq. (100) can be resolved with respect to b. To this end, let us form the dot

product of eq. (100) and vector e:

sh β + ch β(e b)
ch β + sh β (eb)

=

sh β + ch β(e a)
ch β + sh β (ea)

+ ν

sh β + ch β(en) ]
ch β + sh β(en) ≡

B ;

the right hand side of eq. (101) is designated by B. From eq. (101) it follows

sh β + ch β(e b) = B ch β + B sh β (eb) ,

The relation (101) is in accordance with the identity B
≡
(101), the previous relation (100) can be much simpliﬁed:

It is quite understandable that (101) and (103) are the projections of eq. (100) onto direction

in the moving reference frame as a function of the (β, e; n′, a′) . We must note that
in contrast to the ordinary reﬂection law (when the expression Aa′ + Bn′ + Cb′ in
fact presents a 2-dimensional object – plane) now in the moving reference frame K
we will have in general a 3-space object Aa + Bn + Cb .

Now, one other aspect of the problem under consideration should be discussed. The obtained
form of the light reﬂection law in the moving reference frame depends, strictly speaking, on the
occasional choice of the direction of the normal light motion: namely, from the surface. However,
one might chose opposite direction, that is the light ray going to the surface.
The matter is that the simple relation between two corresponding vectors

will not preserve its form with respect to Lorentz transformation. Indeed, in the moving reference
frame we will have

Existence of the two substantially diﬀerent normal vectors in the moving reference
frame makes us to consider the formulas obtained for the light reﬂection in the moving
reference frame as ones describing the relativistic aberration eﬀect for two diﬀerent
triples of light velocity vectors: a, b, n and a, b, N. One may expect to reach more
clarity in looking at the geometrical properties of the reﬂecting surfaces with respect
to relativistic motion of the reference frame.

10 On the form of reﬂection surface in the moving reference

frame

In the rest reference frame K ′, the reﬂection surface is a plane. Let d be its (unit) normal
vector, the the known form of the plane is given by (here D is the distance from the origin O to
the plane)

S′ :

x′ d′ + D = 0 ,

Now we should associate with this plane S′, purely geometrical object, a set of events in

space-time:

S′ :

the plane (d, D)

=

(t′, x′ = (x′

1, x′

2, x′
3)

.

⇒
To this end, at the moment t′ = 0 let light signals be sent at all directions to the plane – the
arriving of any particular signal to the plane gives rise to an event:

{

}

x′ = W′ t′,

=

⇒

′2 = W
x

′2 t

′2,

t′ = √x

′2 .

Therefore, to the reﬂection plane corresponds the following set of space-time events:

S′ :

=

⇒

t′ = √x

′2 , x′ d′ + D′ = 0

.

o

The same set of event can be observed in the moving reference frame:

x = W t,

x2 = W2 t2,

t = √x2 .

n

=

⇒

As a result, the above equation of the plane (115) will take a new form (take notice that here
the Lorentz transform acts only onto x′ whereas the two quantities d and D′ are considered as
given parameters – below we will omit the prime symbol ′ at them)

t = √x2 , [ x + e ( sh β t + (ch β

1) (ex) ) ] d + D = 0

,

(117)

n

−

o

To obtain an equation for geometrical surface in the reference frame K one should exclude

the variable t with the help of the ﬁrst relation in (117):

S :

(xd) + (ed)

sh β ( √x2 ) + (ch β

1) (ex)

+ D = 0 .

(118)

h

−

i

This equation describes the geometry of the reﬂection surface S in the moving
reference frame K. In the rest reference frame K ′ (when β = 0) eq. (118) becomes
an equation of the plane.

To avoid misunderstanding it should be noted one special case: when vector e is
orthogonal to the normal vector d we have the identity (ed) = 0 which means that in
this case the plane in the rest reference frame does not change its geometrical shape
in the moving reference frame:

S :

(xd) + D = 0 .

Let us check our calculation by seing form of this general result (118) for a particular case

x = (x, y, 0) ,

d = (cos α, sin α, 0) ,

e = (1, 0, 0) ,

(119)

at this eq. (118) gives

and further

x cos α + y sin α + cos α [ sh β

x2 + y2 + (ch β

1)x ] + D = 0 ,

−

y sin α + cos α(sh β

x2 + y2 + ch β x ) + D = 0 .

It may be easily veriﬁed that eq. (118) corresponds to a second order surface. Indeed,

−

and further we get to

(ed) sh β ( √x2 ) = (xd) + (ed)(ex) (ch β

1) + D ,

−

(ed)2sh2β x2 = [(xd) + (ed)(ex) (ch β

1) + D]2 .

(121)

11 Canonical form of the reﬂection surface S in the K-frame

Now we are to perform analysis extending the Section 5: with the use of a special rotation

in 3-space and then a special shift in 3-space the equation of the reﬂection surface S

(ed)2sh2β x2 = [(xd) + (ed)(ex) (ch β

1) + D]2

(122)

is to be taken to a canonical form (supposedly it is a hyperboloid).

We need some fact on rotations in 3-space. An arbitrary rotation matrix can be given as

follows (more details see in [86]):

Let us introduce new (rotated) variables X′:

parameters ca will be determined below. Take notice that any rotation matrix obeys the so
called orthogonality condition: O−1 = ˜O . In the new variables, eq. (131) looks as

It is the point to determine a rotation needed: let the identity hold

such a rotation O(c) provides us with a new Cartesian coordinate system (X, Y, Z) for which
the axis Z is located along the vector f . An explicit form of that rotation can be found quite
easily7 As a result, eq. (133) reads

frame K ′ corresponds an equation

O(ϕ, k′)K′ = K′ .

′2 + y

′2 = R2 .

Through light signals, with this geometrical circle can be associated the following set of events
S′ in space-time:

will take this events set S′ to the form

S :

Excluding the time variable t, one gets for geometrical surface S in the moving reference frame

So, we arrive at a second order equation

13 On the form of spherical mirror in the moving reference

frame, general 3-dimensional case

A spherical mirror in the rest reference frame K ′ is described by the equation

with it can be related the special set of events S′ in space-time:

x′x′ = R2 ;

S′ =

t′ = √x′x′ = R, x′x′ = R2

.

(146)

The Lorentz transform change it to other form

From this it follows

or

and further

Excluding the time variable t, one gets an equation corresponding to a geometrical form of

the same surface in the moving reference frame

[ x + e ( sh β √xx + (ch β

1) (ex) ) ]2 = R2 .

−

x2 + 2 (ex)[ sh β √xx + (ch β

1)2 (ex)2 = R2 ,

−

ch2β x2 + sh2β (ex)2 + 2sh β ch β √xx (ex) = R2 .

Thus, we have arrived at the equation

2sh β ch β √xx (ex) = R2

ch2β x2

sh2β (ex)2 .

−
It make sense to employ special coordinate system – such that e become oriented along the ﬁrst
axis:

−

(147)

(148)

Oe = (1, 0, 0),

ex = e ˜OOx = (Oe)

X = X

as a result eq. (147) will take a simpler form

14 The light reﬂection law in media

Let a light ray (incident and reﬂected) be propagated in a uniform media with refraction
index n > 1. In the rest reference frame K ′ the reﬂection law preserves its form. However, there
arise diﬀerences when going to a moving reference frame K.

The fact of the most signiﬁcance is that when using ordinary (vacuum-based) Lorentz trans-
formations then because the speed of light in the rest media is less than c ( kc < c) the modulus
of the light velocity does not preserve its value, as a result meaning of the formulas becomes
very diﬀerent.

Instead of eq. (68) now we have

however, one must take into account that the lengths of the vectors involved a, b, n are diﬀerent

Thus, the speed of light is not invariant quantity under the ordinary Lorentz
transformations; it depends on mutual orientation of w′ and e – remembering µ =
ew′. In any moving reference frame K, the light velocity W in the media is less than
vacuum velocity.

Eq. (158) can be written as

There are two simple cases of (anti) parallel motion of the light and reference frame:

From the formulas obtained (158) and (155), one can readily derive relationship describing

aberration of the light in the moving reference frame. Indeed,

W =

kµ sh β

W =

(162)

So that a unit vector of the light in the K frame is given by

This relation is much simpliﬁed when the vectors w′ and e are perpendicular to each other:

therefore the angle of aberration is as follows:

It should be especially noted one other aspect of the problem: eq. (162) means that
the light velocity in the reference frame K is a function of direction of the propagation
of the light. This fact is of most signiﬁcance because it change basically the general
structure of special relativity in presence of a media. In such circumstances there
appears an absolute reference frame related to the rest media, the reference frame K ′.
In the reference frame K ′, the light velocity is an isotropic quantity that preserves
its value in all space directions. In any other reference frame, moving K, the light
velocity is anisotropic – it is a function of directions.

It is convenient to write eq. (158) in the form

16 Relativistic velocities and Lobachewski geometry

The problem considered of describing the light 4-velocities in contrast to usual 4-velocities
has an interesting geometrical interpretation8 . Indeed, every 4-vector ua = (u0, u) obeys the
condition

(u0)2

u2 = 1

−

(180)

which gives the known realization of the 3-dimensional Lobachewski space H3 of constant nega-
tive curvature as a surface in a pseudo Euclidean 4-space. There exist one-to-one correspondence
between 4-velocities and points of the geometrical space of negative constant curvature H3.

8The composition law for velocities is intimately related with hyperbolic geometry (i.e. geometry on spaces
with constant negative curvature), as was ﬁrst pointed out by A. Sommerfeld [87], V. Variˇcak , Alfred A. Robb
[88-90], and ´Emile Borel [91]. More recently the subject was elaborated on by Abraham A. Ungar (Ungar [92];
many others aspects see in [87].

One can see that all points at spatial inﬁnity making the bounding domain ¯H3 are described

by

Geometrical considerations can be helpful additional instrument in studying the problem.
For instance, let us pose the question: to what extent will diﬀer ordinary velocity and light one.
As an appropriate characteristic let us try the geometrical distance between respective points in
the space H3. It is known the formula for metric of H3 in coordinates (B, θ, φ) :

dl2 = dB2 + sh 2B(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2) ,

(W = th B) .

(185)

The distance between two points, (W1, θ0, φ0) and (W2 = 1, θ0, φ0), along the ﬁxed direction

(θ0, φ0) is given by

Thus, in geometrical terms, any ordinary velocity W1 being just slightly diﬀerent
from the light one W2 = 1 is located the inﬁnite distance from the light velocity:
it provides us with
l =

can be interpreted as special group actions on the points of Lobachewsky space H3.
To the case of the light in vacuum there corresponds such group actions upon the
points of the bound ¯H3 of the space (located in the inﬁnity); at this the 3-dimensional
problem (16.11) eﬀectively reduces to 2-dimensional one because the normalization
condition holds

′2 = W2 = 1 .

However, for the light in the media both vectors W′ and W do not belong this bound
¯H3, they both are ordinary ﬁnite points in the space H3.

17 On relativistic transformation of the geometrical form of

the surface to a moving reference frame in presence of a
media

(IN VACUUM)

53

Let us recall the above method to determine the form of any rigid surface in a moving

reference frame Let the surface S′ be given in the rest reference frame

To this geometrical structure one can pose in correspondence a special set of events in space-time:

S′ :

ϕ(x) = 0

.

}

{

(192)

which with respect to Lorentz formulas

(t′, x′) :

x′ = W′t′ , ϕ(x′) = 0

}

{

x′ = e sh β t + x + (ch β

t′ = ch β t + sh β e x ,

−

will take other form

(t, x) :

x = Wt , ϕ [ x + e ( sh β t + (ch β

1) ex ) ] = 0

−

.

}

{

In order to obtain an equation for the transformed geometrical surface S, one should exclude
the time variable t:

x = Wt, t = √x2 ,

(W2 = 1 ) ;

so one produces

S :

ϕ [ x + e ( sh β √x2 + (ch β

1) ex ) ] = 0 .

(IN THE MEDIA)

In the same line one can act for the case of a uniform media when the light velocity W

these events change into

(t, x) :

With the help of light signals, one to the S′ structure can be referred a set of events in space-time:

Now, it is the point to exclude the time variable t , however one must take into account the rule
(195):

x = Wt,

The relation (196) describing the change in the form of a rigid surface in presence
of media gives a general solution to the problem under consideration. However, that
solution in not explicit and in any particular case we need some additional analysis
to have in hand the new transformed form of the surface in fact.

Formal scheme of Special Relativity in a uniform media can be constructed on the base of

the light velocity in the media kc ([94-96]; see the recent paper [97]):

20. Conclusions

Let us summarize some results.

I. The inﬂuence of the relativistic motion of the reference frame on the light

reﬂection law has been investigated in detail.

The method used is based on applying the relativistic aberration aﬀect for three
light signals:
incident, normal and reﬂected rays. Two choices for a normal light
signal in the rest reference frame are used: one going to and another going from the
reﬂecting surface. The form of the reﬂection law in the moving reference frame is
substantially modiﬁed and includes an additional parameter which is the velocity
vector of the reference frame. The relationship produced proves invariance under
Lorentz group transformations. It is shown that the reﬂected ray, as measured by
a moving observer, would not in general be in the same plane as the incident and
normal rays. So a plane geometric ﬁgure, determined by the incident, normal and
reﬂected rays, may be observed as having three dimensions.

II. A general method to transform the form of any rigid surface in 3-dimensional
space with respect to the arbitrary directed relative motion of the reference frame has
been detailed.

This method is based on the light signals processes and the invariance of the
light velocity under Lorentz transformations.
It is shown that a moving observer
will measure a plane surface as a hyperboloid. That observer will also measure a
spherical surface as an ellipsoid. A right line in the plane is seen by a moving observer
as a hyperbola.

III. Extending of the above analysis to the case of uniform media has been given.
In the case of a uniform media the light velocity is not invariant under Lorentz
transformation and is anisotropic. An alternative scheme of a modiﬁed Lorentz
symmetry based on the invariance of the light velocity in the media is presented. This
signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the formulation of the reﬂection law in the moving reference
frame and also the form of any surface in the moving reference frame compared with
the vacuum case.

IV. Some geometrical aspects of the relativistic velocity concept in terms of the

Lobachewsky 3-geometry are brieﬂy discussed.

Which Physics Laws are Deduced from the
Logic Properties of the Information?

Abstract

The relativity theory principles and the quants theory principles
are deduced from logic properties of the information, obtained from a
physics device.

This paper presents a logic development of the Bergson [1], Whitehead
[2], Capek [3][4], Stapp [5]-[8], Whipple [9] ideas on ”... events must be
treat as the fundamental objective constituents ... events and not particles
constituite the true objective reality”[10]. (The A.Jadczyk and Ph.Blanchard
papers [11]-[13] are related to this topic for some time past.):

An information, which is obtained from a physics device ba, can be ex-
pressed by a set a of any language sentences. The set a is denoted as ”the
recorder of the device ba”. The set of the recorders call into existence struc-
tures, similar to a clocks . The following results are deduced from the logic
properties of the recorders set [14][15]:

First, all such clocks have got the same direction, i.e.

if the event, ex-
pressed by the sentence A, precedes to the event, expressed by the sentence
B, with respect to any such clock, then it is the same for all other such clocks.
Second, the Time, deﬁned by such clocks, proves irreversible, i.e. no the
recorder can obtain the information, that a certain event has taken place,
before it has actually taken place. Thus, nobody can return back into the
Past Times or obtain the information from the Future Times.

Third, the set of recorders has been embedded in the metric space by
some natural method; i.e. all metric space axioms are obtained from the
logic properties of the recorder set.

Fourth, if this metric space proves to be the Euclidean space, then the cor-
responding recorders ”space-time” obeys the Poincare complete group trans-
formations. I.e. in this case the Special Theory Relativity follows from the

logic properties of the information.
then any non-linear geometry exists on the space of the recorders, and any
variant of the General Relativity Theory can be realized on this space.

Therefore, the principal time properties - the one-dimensionality and the
irreversibility -, the space metric properties and the spatial-temporal princi-
ples of the theory of the relativity are deduced from the logic properties of
the recorders set. Hence, if you have got any set of the objects, which able to
get, to keep and/or to give any information, then ”the time” and ”the space”
are inevitable on this set. And it is all the same: or this set is in our world
or this set is in any other worlds, in which the spatial- temporal structure
does not exist initially. Hence, the spatial-temporal structure arises from the
logic properties of the information.

There is the evident nigh aﬃnity between the classical probability func-
tion and the Boolean function of the classical propositional logic [16]. These
functions are diﬀered by the range of value, only. That is if the range of
values of the Boolean function shall be expanded from the two-elements set
{0; 1} to the segment [0; 1] of the real numeric axis then the logic analog of
the Bernoulli Large Number Law can be deduced from the logic axioms. And
if the range of values of such function shall be expanded to the segment of
some suitable variant of the hyperreal numeric axis then this theorem shall
insert some statistical meaning for this function [17].

The probability must comply with certain simple condition in order to be
expressed by a relativistic µ + 1-vector of the probability density [18]. Such
probability is denoted as ”the trackelike probability”. The Dirac equation is
deduced from such probability properties by the Poincare group transforma-
tions [19] [20]. Hence the physics elementary particle behavior in the vacuum
looks like to the trackelike probability behavior. In the two- slits experiment
if the partition with two slits between the source of the physics particle and
the detecting screen exists in the vacuum then the interference of the prob-
ability is observed. But if this system shall be placed in the Wilson cloud
chamber then the particle shall got the clear trace, marked by the condensate
drops, and whole interference shall vanished. It looks like to the following:
the physics particle exists in the moment, only, in which some event on this
particle is happening. And in other times this particle does not exist and the
probability of some event on this particle exists, only.

2

Hence, if an events on this particle do not happen between the event-
birth and the event-detection then the particle behavior is the probability
behavior between these events, and the interference is visible. But in the
Wilson cloud chamber, where the ionization acts form the almost continuous
line, the particle has got the clear trace and no the interference. And the
particle moves because such line is not absolutely continuous. Every point
of the ionization act has got the neighboring ionization point, and the event
on this particle is not happen between these points. Therefore, the physics
particle moves because the corresponding probability is propagated in the
space between these points.

Therefore a particle is an ensemble of events, bounded by a probabilities

(that is similar to [21]).

In the 3 + 1 space-time all interactions between fermions can be expressed
by some algebra (the Cayley algebra) but such algebra does not exist in the
space- time with more than 3 + 1 dimension [22]. Hence the fermions can
not go out from this 3 + 1 space-time.

Thus particles and ﬁelds are not the basic entities of Universe but the logic
events and the logic probabilities are the basic entities. Universe - i.e. the
time, the space and whole their contents - is the by-product of the deduction
from the logic events.

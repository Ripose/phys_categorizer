Abstract

The idea of a ‘condensed’ vacuum state is generally accepted in modern elementary parti-

cle physics. We argue that this should motivate a new generation of precise ‘ether-drift’

experiments with present-day technology.

1. The idea of a ‘condensed’ vacuum is generally accepted in modern elementary particle

physics. Indeed, in many diﬀerent contexts one introduces a set of elementary quanta whose

perturbative ‘empty’ vacuum state

is not the physical ground of the interacting theory. In

the physically relevant case of the Standard Model, the situation can be summarized saying

o

[1] that ”What we experience as empty space is nothing but the conﬁguration of the Higgs

ﬁeld that has the lowest possible energy. If we move from ﬁeld jargon to particle jargon, this

means that empty space is actually ﬁlled with Higgs particles. They have Bose condensed.”

In this case, where the condensing quanta are just neutral spinless particles (the ‘phions’

[2]), the translation from ‘ﬁeld jargon to particle jargon’, amounts to establish a well deﬁned
functional relation (see ref.[2]) n = n(φ2) between the average particle density n in the k = 0

mode and the average value of the scalar ﬁeld

= φ. Thus, Bose condensation is just a

consequence of the minimization condition of the eﬀective potential Veﬀ (φ). This has absolute
minima at some values φ =

= 0 for which n(v2) = ¯n

= 0 [2].

The symmetric phase, where

= 0 and n = 0, will eventually be re-established at a

phase transition temperature T = Tc. This, in the Standard Model, is so high that one can

safely approximate the ordinary vacuum as a zero-temperature system (for comparison think
12 oK). This observation provides the argument to represent
of 4He at a temperature of 10−
the vacuum as a quantum Bose liquid, i.e. a medium where bodies can ﬂow without any
apparent friction, as in superﬂuid 4He, in agreement with the experimental results.

On the other hand, the condensed particle-physics vacuum, while certainly diﬀerent from

the ether of classical physics, is also diﬀerent from the ‘empty’ space-time of Special Relativity

which is assumed at the base of axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory. Therefore, following this

line of thought, one may ask whether the macroscopic occupation of the same quantum state

(k = 0 in a given reference frame) can represent the operative construction of a ‘quantum

ether’ whose existence might be detected through a precise ‘ether-drift’ experiment, of the

type performed at the end of ninenteenth century and in the ﬁrst half of twentieth century.

This question leads to the basic issue of a Lorentz-covariant description of the vacuum that

will be addressed in the following section.

2. Although widely accepted, vacuum condensation is usually considered just a convenient

way to rearrange the set of original degrees of freedom. In this perspective, all diﬀerences

between the physical vacuum and empty space are believed to be reabsorbable into some

basic parameters, such as the particle masses and few physical constants, while leaving for

the rest an exact Lorentz-covariant theory.

On a more formal ground we observe, however, that the coexistence of exact Lorentz

covariance and vacuum condensation in eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theories is not so trivial. In

fact, as a consequence of the violations of locality at the energy scale ﬁxed by the ultraviolet

cutoﬀ Λ [3], one may be faced with non-Lorentz-covariant infrared eﬀects that depend on the

vacuum structure.

This phenomenon can be understood in very simple terms starting from the observation

that, in a cutoﬀ theory, the elementary quanta are treated as ‘hard spheres’ of radius a

1/Λ,

as for the molecules of ordinary matter. For the same reason, however, the simple idea that

deviations from Lorentz-covariance take only place at the cutoﬀ scale is incorrect. In fact, it

is true that in the perturbative empty vacuum state (with no condensed quanta) non-locality

k
is restricted to very short wavelengths 2π/
|

| ≤

a. However, in a condensed vacuum, the

hard spheres will ‘touch’ each other giving rise to the propagation of long-wavelength density

∼

ﬂuctuations that, by deﬁnition, cannot be described in a Lorentz-covariant way.

To indicate this type of infrared-ultraviolet connection, originating from vacuum con-

densation in eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theories, Volovik [4] has introduced a very appropriate

name: reentrant violations of special relativity in the low-energy corner. In the simplest case
of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a λΦ4 theory, where the condensing quanta are just

neutral spinless particles, the ‘reentrant’ eﬀects reduce to a small shell of three-momenta,

say

k
|
|

< δ, where the energy spectrum deviates from a Lorentz-covariant form. Namely, by

denoting MH as the typical energy scale associated with the Lorentz-covariant part of the

energy spectrum, one ﬁnds

δ
MH →

0 only when MH

0.

Λ →

The basic ingredient to detect such ‘reentrant’ eﬀects in the broken phase consists in

a purely quantum-ﬁeld-theoretical result: the connected zero-four-momentum propagator
1(k = 0) is a two-valued function [5, 6]. In fact, besides the well known solution G−

a (k =

1

G−
0) = M 2

H , one also ﬁnds G−

1
b (k = 0) = 0.

The b-type of solution corresponds to processes where assorbing (or emitting) a very

small 3-momentum k

0 does not cost a ﬁnite energy. This situation is well known in

a condensed medium, where a small 3-momentum can be coherently distributed among a

large number of elementary constituents, and corresponds to the hydrodynamical regime of

are larger than rmfp, the mean free path for

This interpretation [7, 8] of the gap-less branch, which is very natural on the base of

general arguments, is unavoidable in a superﬂuid medium.
In fact, ”Any quantum liquid
consisting of particles with integral spin (such as the liquid isotope 4He) must certainly have

2

a spectrum of this type...In a quantum Bose liquid, elementary excitations with small mo-

menta k (wavelengths large compared with distances between atoms) correspond to ordinary

hydrodynamic sound waves, i.e. are phonons. This means that the energy of such quasi-

particles is a linear function of their momentum” [9].

In this sense, a superﬂuid vacuum

provides for k

0 a universal picture. This result does not depend on the details of the

short-distance interaction and even on the nature of the elementary constituents. For in-

→

stance, the same coarse-grained description is found in superﬂuid fermionic vacua [10] that,
as compared to the Higgs vacuum, bear the same relation of superﬂuid 3He to superﬂuid 4He.

Thus there are two possible types of excitations with the same quantum numbers but

diﬀerent energies when the 3-momentum k

3. Let us now return to the basic question posed at the end of Section 1. For ﬁnite values

of Λ there are long-wavelength density ﬂuctuations of the vacuum and Lorentz-covariance is

not exact. Therefore, in the presence of such eﬀects, can we try to detect the existence of the

scalar condensate through a precise ‘ether-drift’ experiment ?

We ﬁrst observe that a simple physical interpretation of the long-wavelength density

has been proposed in refs.[7, 8]. Introducing GF

UN (x) being the Newton potential. Indeed, with the choice in Eq.(12), to ﬁrst order in ϕ and

in the limits of slow motions, the equations of motion for ϕ reduce to the Poisson equation

for the Newton potential UN [7, 8] so that the deviations from Lorentz covariance are of

gravitational strength. If, as in the Standard Model, GF is taken to be the Fermi constant

At the same time, to ﬁrst order, the observable eﬀects of ϕ can be re-absorbed [8] into an

that agrees with the ﬁrst approximation to the line element of General Relativity [14, 15].

In this perspective, the space-time curvature arises from a re-scaling of the space-time units

and from a refractive index for light propagation

so that the speed of light in the condensate frame (in units of c = 2.9979...1010 cm/sec) is

4. This type of space-time picture leads naturally to the classical ‘ether-drift’ experiments

performed by Michelson and Morley [17], Illingworth [18] and Miller [19] that have been

recently re-analyzed by Cahill and Kitto [20]. Their conclusion is very simple and suggests the

solution of the long-standing problem concerning the nature of the observed eﬀects. Namely,

measuring devices are dynamically aﬀected by their absolute motion in such a way that

this motion becomes unobservable [22, 23]. However, if light propagates in a medium with

= 1, there is a small mismatch so that absolute motion may become observable. In

Nmedium 6
the following we shall argue that this eﬀect is not in contradiction with Special Relativity.

To this end, let us introduce an observer S′ that moves in an inﬁnite, isotropical and
homogeneous medium that deﬁnes an observer S. Let us also consider two light beams, say 1

and 2, that are perpendicular in S where they propagate along the x and y axis with velocities

c

medium . Let us also assume that the velocity v of S′ is along the x axis.
In this case, to evaluate the velocities of 1 and 2 for S′, we can apply Lorentz transformations

and

In this way, a Lorentz transformation is equivalent to a local anisotropy that becomes larger

and larger by increasing the value of v.

Let us now deﬁne L′A and L′B to be the lengths of two optical paths, say A and B, as
measured in the S′ frame. For instance, they can represent the lengths of the arms of an
interferometer which is at rest in the S′ frame. In the ﬁrst experimental set-up, the arm of
length L′A is taken along the direction of motion associated with the beam 1 while the arm of
length L′B lies along the direction of the beam 2. Notice that the two arms, in the S′ frame,
form an angle that diﬀers from 90o by
(v/c) terms.

Therefore, using the above results, the time for the beam 1 to go forth and back along

To evaluate the time T ′B, for the beam 2 to go forth and back along the arm of length L′B,
one has ﬁrst to compute the modulus of its velocity in the S′ frame

On the other hand, if the beam 2 were to propagate along the optical path A and the beam

In this way S′ will now be able to determine its ‘absolute’ velocity in complete agreement
with Special Relativity. In fact, for S′ Eq.(27) is the only way to detect the existence of the
S observer through the value of a velocity v whose operative deﬁnition, otherwise, would be

unclear (dealing with a uniform motion in an inﬁnite, isotropical and homogeneous medium).

On the other hand, if the numerical value
determine S through an eﬀective , reduced velocity vobs ∼
itself.

Nmedium 6

= 1 were unknown, S′ would try to
√kmediumv rather than through v

Now, the following question naturally arises. What happens if we remove the medium

everywhere except in a small region of space that includes the arms of the interferometer ?

7

Will the fringes shift upon rotation of the apparatus ? At ﬁrst sight, the answer is positive.

In fact, the occurrence of a fringe shift by rotating an apparatus at rest in the S′ frame cannot
depend on the presence of the medium in the outer regions of space. After some thought,

however, the answer might become negative. Indeed, one may argue that the medium is now

taken at rest in the S′ frame so that the two light beams should propagate with the same
velocity, regardless of their orientation.

The latter expectation is based on considering now the observer S′ to be physically equiv-
alent to the observer S introduced before (for which we assumed an exactly isotropical value

u =

medium everywhere). However, this equivalence has no rigorous basis since, diﬀerently

c

from S′, the observer S was taken at rest in an inﬁnite medium.

Therefore, the occurrence (or not) of fringe shifts becomes a purely experimental issue

the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld”. To obtain a consistency check of this interpretation, the authors of

ref.[26] were indeed planning to repeat their analysis by replacing the potentially problematic

parts of their apparatus. However, this improved experiment was never performed [28].

5. We are now ready to return to the density ﬂuctuations of the scalar condensate dis-

cussed in sect.3. To this end we observe that, according to Cahill and Kitto [20] (and

according to our previous analysis) in the vacuum experiments of Joos [29] and of Brillet and

Summarizing: according to current ideas, the vacuum is not ‘empty’. Thus, one should

carefully check the compatibility between exact Lorentz covariance and vacuum condensa-

tion in eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theories. For the speciﬁc case of the scalar condensate, the

non-locality associated with the presence of the ultraviolet cutoﬀ will also show up at long

wavelengths in the form of non-Lorentz-covariant density ﬂuctuations associated with a scalar

function ϕ(x).

If, on the base of refs.[7, 8], these long-wavelength eﬀects are naturally interpreted in

terms of the Newton potential UN (with the identiﬁcation ϕ = UN ), one obtains the weak-

ﬁeld space-time curvature of General Relativity and a refractive index

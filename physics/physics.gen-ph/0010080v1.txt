Comment on the Electron Self-Energy Calculation

Yong-Gwan Yi∗

February 21, 2014

Abstract

A quantum-electrodynamical description of the self-energy in which the
interaction is propagated with the velocity of light instead of instantaneously
gives rise to a modiﬁcation of the photon propagator identical with the conver-
gence factor. The self-energy is discussed in relation to the static polarization
induced in the vacuum due to the presence of an electron itself.

The self-energy of an electron is an old problem of electrodynamics. The quan-
tum theory has put the problem in a critical state. In 1939, Weisskopf calculated
the self-energy of an electron according to the positron theory of Dirac, in which
the self-energy diverges only logarithmically [1].
In 1949, Feynman put forward
an intuitive and intelligible method of calculation in attacking this problem [2].
The fact that the integral is not ﬁnite is unavoidable, but the convergence factor
that is adopted for computational purposes deﬁnes the mathematics [3]. From the
discussion of “action-at-a-distance” in classical electrodynamics, meanwhile, I have
attempted to evaluate the self-energy in which the interaction is propagated with
the velocity of light instead of instantaneously. The necessity of such an evaluation
occurred to me on the assumption that action of a source should be explicable solely
on the ﬁnite propagation velocity. I shall comment on the physical signiﬁcance of
the convergence factor.

Looking at the Feynman diagram for the self-energy, one sees at once that it
describes steady-state interaction phenomena. The diagram represents both the
instantaneous interaction of the electron with the Coulomb ﬁeld created by the
electron itself and the self-interaction due to the emission and reabsorption of a
virtual transverse photon. We know, however, in classical electrodynamics that the
Coulomb potential does not act instantaneously, but is delayed by the time of prop-
agation. We also know that the velocity of an electron cannot exceed the velocity
of light, and hence any electron cannot reabsorb a photon it emitted at a retarded
time. From these points of view the Feynman graph illustrating the self-energy is
unnatural. We are thus led to suspect the physical description of the Feynman di-
agram. A physical description of time-dependent interaction necessitates a further
eﬀect.

What further eﬀect can be assumed in the Feynman diagram without violating
the established thought? Perhaps the vacuum polarization is an illustration. To be

consistent with time-dependent interaction, it is necessary to regard an electron-
positron pair as existing part of the time in the form of a virtual photon.

If the photon virtually disintegrates into an electron-positron pair for a certain
fraction of the time, the electron loop gives an additional e2 correction to the photon
propagator through which an electron interacts with itself. The modiﬁcation of the
photon propagator is then the replacement

where Πµν (q) is the vacuum polarization tensor and the iǫ prescription is implicit.
The polarization tensor Πµν (q) is written as the sum of a constant term Π(0) for
q = 0 and terms proportional to (qµqν − δµν q2). The leading term Π(0) is quadrat-
ically divergent constant. In the limit q2 → 0, the q2 term is absorbed into the
renormalization constant. Keeping only the leading term, we see that (1) can be
written as

or

by letting

q2 → q2 − Π(0), (2)

where we have used the operator relation (A − B)−1 = A−1 + A−1BA−1 + · · · .

Let us recall that the convergence factor for a light quantum introduced by

Feynman is

(3)

where Λ2 is the cut-oﬀ constant for q2 and the iǫ prescription is implicit. It becomes
evident that the additional electron loop gives rise to a modiﬁcation of the photon
propagator identical with the convergence factor considered in connection with the
divergent self-energy integral. This fact throws light on the physical implication
of the convergence factor. Physically the modiﬁcation (3) is now looked upon as
the result of superposition of the eﬀects of vacuum polarization rather than that of
quanta of various masses. From a minus sign associated with the closed loop, we can
then understand why we must associate the minus sign with the convergence factor
which has not been explained so far from the latter point of view. By interpreting
Λ2 as Π(0), we can clarify the mathematical content of Feynman’s approach and
emphasize the physical meaning of Weisskopf’s result that the self-energy is due to
the static polarization induced in the vacuum due to the presence of an electron
itself rather than to the reaction back on the electron of its own radiation ﬁelds.

There have been many arguments which say that the quadratically divergent
constant Π(0) must be discarded [4]. This is because it modiﬁes the photon propa-

gator into a propagator for a neutral-vector meson of a mass pΠ(0). Even though

any “honest” calculation gives Π(0) 6= 0, at present, the way we compute the vac-
uum polarization is consistent with assigning a null value to Π(0) which leads to a
nonvanishing photon mass. When viewed from the present point, however, one sees
that the modiﬁcation (3) amounts to the substitution of the value Π(0). Whenever
the photon propagator is supplied with the convergence factor, it amounts to taking
account of the closed loop contribution to the photon propagator. The assumption
of Π(0) has been removed from the discussion, but the appearance of the value is
explicit in the practical calculation.

The polarization tensor Πµν diverges severely. A method of making Πµν conver-
gent without spoiling the gauge invariance has been found by Bethe and by Pauli
[5]. The method states that if we subtract from the integrand of Πµν a similar
expression with m replaced by a very large mass (m2 + Λ2)1/2, we get a much more
reasonable result. Even though such a procedure has no meaning in terms of phys-
ically realizable particles, it characterizes a possible calculation of the closed loop
path of virtual particles. It should be noted that the closed loop is a virtual process
in which an electron-positron pair is physically imaginable particles. The energy
of radiation ﬁelds of an electron is, as usually understood, far less than 2mc2, so
the virtual electron-positron pair is negative in energy compared to the rest mass.
The virtual pair is nothing more than a pair-like concept. The problem is how to
calculate the closed loop path of such a virtual pair. One ﬁnds that the conver-
gence procedure, which suggests taking the diﬀerence of the result for electrons of
p2 = m2 and p2 = m2 + Λ2, is to be expected also from the physical standpoint.
The convergence procedure shows itself in a deﬁnite way

Πµν −→ Z (cid:16)(cid:2)Πµν(cid:3)p2=m2 −(cid:2)Πµν(cid:3)p2=m2+λ2(cid:17) dλ.

The formulation suggests an obvious modiﬁcation

Πµν −→ (cid:2)Πµν(cid:3)p2<m2

via

(cid:2)Πµν(cid:3)p2=m2 −(cid:2)Πµν(cid:3)p2>m2 ,

(5)

which ﬁts in completely with the physical description of such a virtual electron-
positron pair.

The further eﬀect which we have assumed for computing the electron self-energy
is the vacuum polarization. In radiative corrections, a “fundamental” eﬀect which
gives rise to the modiﬁcation of the photon propagator would be the vacuum po-
larization that describes corrections to a virtual photon.

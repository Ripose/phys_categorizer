SUMMARY
Uniﬁed Model (UM) represents the next stage of our eﬀorts for uniﬁcation
of vacuum, matter and ﬁelds from few ground postulates. New concept of Bi-
vacuum is introduced, as a dynamic matrix of the Universe with superﬂuid
and nonlocal properties, composed from non mixing microscopic sub-quantum
particles of the opposite energies. The collective quantum excitations of sub-
quantum particles and antiparticles form the correlated pairs [rotor (V +) +
antirotor (V −)], representing mesoscopic double cells-dipoles. The macro-
scopic structure of Bivacuum is formed by the inﬁnitive number of these cells-
dipoles. The rotor (V +) and antirotor (V −) of cell- dipoles have the opposite
quantized energy, virtual mass, spin, charge and magnetic moments. In primor-
dial Bivacuum, i.e. in the absence of matter and ﬁelds, the absolute values of all
these parameters in each dipole are equal. The radiuses of primordial rotor and
antirotor are equal to Compton radius vortex: [L+ = L− = L0 = ~/m0c]i, where
mi
0 is the rest mass of the electrons of three leptons generation (i = e, µ, τ ).

In secondary Bivacuum the poles of cell-dipoles do not compensate each
other. Such a dipoles are named Bivacuum fermions (BVF↑) and Bivacuum
~, notated as (↑ and ↓), depending on
antifermions (BVF↓) with spin S = ± 1

particles (fermions) and their charge are determined by the diﬀerence between
the actual and complementary mass and between the actual and complemen-
tary charges of sub-elementary fermions/antifermions (F+

of Golden mean. Corresponding diﬀerences are relativist eﬀects, provided by

particles in triplets are equal and determined by energy of uncompensated [F±

of elementary bosons, all the properties, except spins, of three sub-elementary
particles are compensated by properties of three sub-elementary antiparticles.

The physical nature of electromagnetic and gravitational potentials of ele-
mentary particles can be related to nonlocal equilibrium shift (BVF↑ ⇋ BVF↓)
of inﬁnitive number of BVFl of Bivacuum, compensating the local symme-
try shift, induced by zero-point longitudinal (z) and transversal (x) vibrations
of uncompensated sub-elementary particles, as respect to (y) axe, coinciding
with the axe of [F±

corresponding modulation frequencies (ωz and ωx) of the carrying frequency
(ω0 = m0c2/~ > ωz >> ωx) of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of particles, characterize the
electromagnetic and gravitational potentials. The in-phase pulsation of pairs

sub-elementary particles and Bivacuum.

these parameters are determined by anisotropy of momentum and kinetic energy
distribution:

The new compensation principle of Bivacuum symmetry shifts, induced by
matter and ﬁelds, has been formulated as follows:
the spatially localized Bi-
vacuum symmetry shifts, induced by longitudinal and transversal translational
kinetic energy contributions of charged particles, are compensated by nonlocal
symmetry shifts of Bivacuum, realized by [BVF ↑ ⇋ BVF ↓] equilibrium shift.

It is shown, that Principle of least action is a consequence of introduced in
UM ”Harmonization force (HaF)” of asymmetric Bivacuum. This new force,
acting on particles by the mechanism of induced resonance, drives the matter
on all hierarchical levels to Golden mean conditions. The HaF could be respon-
sible for directed evolution of microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic systems
(inorganic and biological ones) to states, optimal for interaction with Bivacuum.

of certain angular velocity of rotation, necessary for suﬃcient synchronization
of [C⇋ W ] pulsation of particles of matter. The accompanied decreasing or in-
creasing of weight of magnets, dependent on clockwise or anticlockwise rotation,
is a result of the additional local Bivacuum symmetry shift, induced by rotating
magnets and their magnetic ﬁeld inﬂuence.

Bivacuum is converted to additional kinetic energy of the electrons in ’collec-

1 Introduction

Einstein never accepted the Bohr’s philosophy, that properties of particles can-
not be analyzed without direct experimental control. Bohr’s objection of EPR
paradox was based on this point.

David Bohm was the ﬁrst one, who made an attempt to explain wholeness of
the Universe, without loosing the causality principle. Experimental discovery:
”Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect” (1950) pointing that electron is able to ”feel” the pres-
ence of a magnetic ﬁeld even in a regions where the probability of ﬁeld existing is
zero, was stimulating. For explanation of nonlocality Bohm introduced in 1952
the notion of quantum potential, which pervaded all of space. But unlike
gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds, its inﬂuence did not decrease with dis-
tance. All the particles are interrelated by very sensitive to any perturbations
quantum potential. This means that signal transmission between particles may
occur instantaneously. The idea of quantum potential or active informa-
tion is close to notion of pilot wave, proposed by de Broglie at the Solvay
Congress in 1927. In fact, Bohm develops the de Broglie idea of pilot wave,
applying it for many-body system.

In our model instead quantum potential we introduced the notion of nonlocal
Bivacuum gap oscillation (BvO). These waves have a concrete interpretation in
the framework of our model and are responsible for nonlocal interaction between
Bivacuum and particles and quantum entalgement between particles by means
of virtual pressure waves.

In 1957 Bohm published a book: Causality and Chance in Modern Physics.
Later he comes to conclusion, that Universe has a properties of giant, ﬂow-
ing hologram. Taking into account its dynamic nature, he prefer to use term:
holomovement. In his book: Wholeness and the Implicate Order (1980) he
develops an idea that our explicated unfolded reality is a product of enfolded
(implicated) or hidden order of existence. He consider the manifestation of all
forms in the universe as a result of enfolding and unfolding exchange between
two orders, determined by super quantum potential.

After Bohm, the manifestation of corpuscle - wave duality of particle is
dependent on the way, which observer interacts with a system. He claims that
both of this properties are always enfolded in particle.

It is a basic diﬀerence with our model, assuming that the wave and cor-
puscle phase are realized alternatively with high frequency during two diﬀerent
semiperiods of sub-elementary particles, forming particles.

In book, written by D. Bohm and B. Hiley (1993): ”THE UNDIVIDED
UNIVERSE. An ontological interpretation of quantum theory” the electron is
considered, as a particle with well- deﬁned position and momentum which are,
however, under inﬂuence of special wave (quantum potential). Elementary par-
ticle, in accordance with these authors, is a sequence of incoming and out-
going waves, which are very close to each other. However, particle itself does
not have a wave nature. Interference pattern in double slit experiment after
Bohm is a result of periodically ”bunched” character of quantum potential.

The important point of Bohmian philosophy, coinciding with our, is that

6

everything in the Universe is a part of dynamic continuum. Neurophysiologist
Karl Pribram does made the next step in the same direction as Bohm: ”The
brain is a hologram enfolded in a holographic Universe”.

The good popular description of Bohm and Pribram ideas are presented in
books: ”The Bell’s theorem and the curious quest for quantum reality” (1990)
by David Peat and ”The Holographic Universe” (1992) by Michael Talbot. Such
original concepts are interesting and stimulating, indeed, but should be consid-
ered as a ﬁrst attempts to transform intuitive perception of duality and quantum
wholeness into clear geometrical and mathematical models.

In 1950 John Wheeler and Charles Misner published Geometrodynamics,
a new description of space-time properties, based on topology. Topology is
more general than Euclidean geometry and deeper than non-Euclidean, used
by Einstein in his General theory of relativity. Topology does not deal with
distances, angles and shapes. Drawn on a sheet of stretching rubber, a circle,
triangle and square are indistinguishable. A ball, pyramid and a cube also can
be transformed into the other. However, objects with holes in them can never
be transformed by stretching and deforming into objects without holes.

For example black hole can be described in terms of topology. It means that
massive rotating body behave as a space-time hole. Wheeler supposed that
elementary particles and antiparticles, their spins, positive and negative charges
can be presented as interconnected black and white holes. Positron and electron
pair correspond to such model. The energy, directed to one of the hole, goes
throw the connecting tube -”handle” and reappears at the other.

The connecting tube exist in another space-time than holes itself. Such a
tube is undetectable in normal space and the process of energy transmission
looks as instantaneous. In conventional space-time two ends of tube, termed
’worm holes’ can be a vast distant apart. It gives an explanation of quantum
nonlocality. Like Bohm’s quantum potential, the Wheeler’s quantum topology
remains fascinating but unproved hypothesis.

Sidharth (1998, 1999) considered elementary particle as a relativistic vortex
of Compton radius, from which he recovered its mass and quantized spin. He
pictured a particle as a ﬂuid vortex steadily circulating with light velocity along
a 2D ring or spherical 3D shell with radius

Inside such vortex the notions of negative energy, superluminal velocities and
nonlocality are acceptable without contradiction with conventional theory.

He treated also a charged Dirac fermions, as a Kerr-Newman black holes.
Barut and Bracken (1981) considered zitterbewegung - rapidly oscillating
imaginary part of particle position, leading from Dirac theory (1958), as a har-
monic oscillator in the Compton wavelength region of particle. Hestness (1990)
proposed, that zitterbewegung arises from self interaction, resulting from elec-
tromagnetic wave-particle duality. Withing the region of Compton vortex the
superluminal velocity and negative energy are possible.
If measurements are
averaged over time t ˜mc2/~ and over space L˜~/mc, the imaginary part of par-
ticle’s position disappears and we are back in usual Physics (Sidharth, 1998).

Serious attack on problem of quantum nonlocality was performed by Roger
Penrose (1989) with his twister theory of space-time. After Penrose, quantum
phenomena can generate space-time. The twisters, proposed by him, are lines
of inﬁnite extent, resembling twisting light rays. Interception or conjunction of
twistors lead to origination of particles. In such a way the local and nonlocal
properties and particle-wave duality are interrelated in twistor geometry. The
analysis of main quantum paradoxes was presented by Asher Peres (1992) and
Charles Bennett et. al., (1993).

In our Uniﬁed model the local properties, within the Compton region of
Bivacuum dipoles, are resulted from local Bivacuum symmetry shifts of sub-
elementary particles, accompanied their inertial mass and charge origination.
Their nonlocal (ﬁeld) properties of particles are the consequence of Bivacuum
gap symmetry oscillation (BvSO), exciting in a course of their [C ⇋ W ] pulsa-
tion, compensating the local symmetry oscillations.

It is important to note, that formalism and quite diﬀerent approach for
computational derivation of quantum relativist systems with forward-backward
space-time shifts, developed by Daniel Dubois (1999), led to some results, similar
to ours (Kaivarainen, 1993, 1995, 2001). For example, the group and phase
masses, introduced by Dubois, related to internal group and phase velocities
has analogy with actual and complementary masses, introduced in our Uniﬁed
model (UM). In both approaches, the product of these masses is equal to the
particle’s rest mass squared. The notion of discrete time interval, used in Dubois
approach, may correspond to PERIOD of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of sub-elementary
particles in UM. The positive internal time interval, in accordance to our model,

8

corresponds to forward C → W transition and the negative one to the backward
W → C transition.

In theory of Haisch, Rueda and Puthoﬀ (1994), Rueda and Haish (1998)
it was proposed, that the inertia is a reaction force, originating in a course
of dynamic interaction between the electromagnetic zero-point ﬁeld (ZPF) of
vacuum and charge of elementary particles.

In our approach, the resistance of particle to acceleration (i.e. inertia force),
proportional to its mass (second Newton’s law) is a consequence of resistance of
Bivacuum symmetry for changing, necessary for compensation of the particle’s
momentum and kinetic energy change.

Consequently, the inertial property of mass is a consequence of Bivacuum re-
luctance to change its symmetry shift, necessary for compensation of the kinetic
energy of particle change. In contrast to nonlocal Mach’s principle, our theory
of particle-Bivacuum interaction explains the existence of inertial mass of even
single particle in empty Universe. The result of our Uniﬁed model, that the
mass of fermion, is a primary phenomena and its charge is a secondary one, is
more reliable, than vice-versa because the energy, related with mass (E = mc2),
is much bigger, than that related with charge.

Both approaches have similarity in ﬁnal conclusion, that inertia may be
explained as a local vacuum - related phenomena, without applying to nonlocal
Mach’s principle and Higgs ﬁeld.

The work, presented here,

is a next stage of development of
the Uniﬁed model of Bivacuum, [corpuscle (C) ⇋ wave (W )] duality,
electromagnetism and gravitation (Kaivarainen, 1993; 1995; 2001a; 2002;
2002a).

The model of Bivacuum is a result of new interpretation of Dirac’s the-
ory, pointing to equal probability of positive and negative energy (Dirac, 1958).
The symmetry of our Bivacuum as respect to probability of elementary parti-
cles and antiparticles creation, makes it principally diﬀerent from asymmetric
Dirac’s vacuum (1958), with its realm of negative energy saturated with elec-
trons. Positrons in his model represent the ’holes’, originated as a result of the
electrons jumps in realm of positive energy. Currently it becomes clear, that the
Dirac’s model of vacuum is not general enough to explain all know experimental
data, for example, the bosons emergency.

The main goals of our work can be formulated as follows:
1. Development of Bivacuum model as the dynamic matrix of double cells-
dipoles (Bivacuum fermions). Explanation of the elementary fermions: elec-
trons, positrons, etc. and bosons, like photons creation from triplets of asym-
metric Bivacuum dipoles - sub-elementary fermions. As far in each triplet,
the sub-elementary fermion and sub-elementary antifermion, forming symmet-
ric pairs, compensate the properties of each other, the resulting parameters of
triplet (mass, charge, spin, etc.) are deﬁned by third - uncompensated sub-
elementary fermion. The resulting external properties of elementary particles
are described by the existing formalism of quantum mechanics and Maxwell
equations;

1.1 New Model of Bivacuum

We deﬁne Bivacuum, as a dynamic matrix of the Universe with superﬂuid and
nonlocal properties, composed from non mixing collective excitations of micro-
scopic sub-quantum particles of the opposite energies. The meso - structure
of Bivacuum is presented by inﬁnitive number of three-dimensional (3D) dou-
ble cells-dipoles, each cell containing a pair of correlated rotors and antirotors:
(V +) and (V −) with the opposite quantized virtual mass (m+
C , where
i2 = −1). The rotors and antirotors, as a main elements of Bivacuum, are the re-
sult of collective excitations (circulation) of ultramicroscopic sub-quantum par-
ticles and sub-quantum antiparticles, correspondingly. The size of sub-quantum
particles/antiparticles should be of 10−28 cm, or less, when all kind of interac-
tions [electromagnetic (EM), weak and strong] come together. The (V +) and
(V −) are separated by energetic gap, depending on the energy of collective
excitations and related to their radius. It is assumed, that the medium of sub-
quantum particles, ﬁlling Bivacuum, has a properties of superﬂuid liquid and

C = i2m−

10

the formalism of hydrodynamics for liquids without friction is applicable to
Bivacuum.

We postulate in our model, that the fundamental quantized energies and
| c2/~) of each of rotor [V +] and antirotor [V −]

frequencies (ωe,µ,τ
correspond to the rest mass of three electron’s generation: e, µ, τ.

Consequently, just a quantum discreet Bivacuum properties is a background

The pairs of rotors ( V +) and antirotors ( V −) form diﬀerent kinds of dipoles:
the mass, electric and magnetic dipoles. They carry equal by absolute value, but
opposite by signs virtual mass
, electric charges |e+| = |−e−|
=
and magnetic moments |µ+| = |−µ−| . Consequently, the primordial Bivacuum
(in the absence of matter and ﬁelds) on macroscopic scale is a neutral medium
with resulting energy, mass, spin, charge, magnetic moment - equal to zero, due
to zero symmetry shift. It is ﬁlled with inﬁnitive number of double vorticity
excitations (double cells - dipoles): Bivacuum fermions (BV F ↑
S=1/2 = V + ⇈
V − ) and antifermions (BV F ↓
S=−1/2 = V + (cid:21) V −) with opposite half-integer
spins, corresponding to the opposite circulation of pairs [rotor + antirotor]. In
each pair of BV F ↑
S=−1/2 the rotor and antirotor are in-phase.
From condition of the resulting spin of Bivacuum equal to zero, it follows,
that the total number of BV F ↑
S=1/2 and BV F ↓
S=−1/2 should be equal due
to dynamic equilibrium. The intermediate transition state between Bivacuum
fermions of opposite spins with antiphase (V +) and (V −) rotation represents
Bivacuum boson (BV B±

and zero spin:

Bivacuum bosons have a properties of Falaco soliton in description of Kiehn

(1998).

The double cells of BV F l

equal to zero, can be considered as a virtual molecules of Bivacuum, forming
Virtual Bose Condensate (VirBC) with nonlocal properties (Kaivarainen, 2001a;

quantum particles and antiparticles in a course of transitions between the rotors
and antirotors states of diﬀerent quantum numbers: n = 0, 1, 2, 3...

In accordance to model, the external momentum of double cells is zero
(pext = 0), in contrast to internal momentum (|p+| = |−p+| = m±

that a system of double cells forms the virtual Bose condensate (VirBC) with

1.2 Virtual Bose Condensation (VirBC) of Bivacuum as

a Base of Nonlocality

The Virial theorem in general form is correct not only for classical, but as well
for quantum systems. It relates the averaged external kinetic ¯Tk(~v) =
i /2
and potential ¯V (r) energies of particles, composing these systems:

If the potential energy V (r) is a homogeneous n − order function like:

then average external kinetic and average potential energies are related as:

V (r) ∼ rn

V (r)

For example, for a harmonic oscillator, when ¯Tk = ¯V ,we have n = 2.
For Coulomb interaction: n = −1 and ¯T = − ¯V /2.
It is interesting to note, that at the average kinetic energy and momentum

(p) tending to zero:

the interaction between particles of system becomes nonlocal, i.e. indepen-

dent on distance between them:

Tk = p2/2m → 0

V (r) ∼ r(0) = 1 = const

The resulting energy and momentum of primordial Bivacuum keeps constant
in a course of strictly correlated spontaneous transitions in two parts of dou-
ble cells, corresponding to positive (+) and negative (-) energy, because they
compensate each other. The sequential excitation/relaxation of double cells of
Bivacuum is followed by virtual pressure waves (VPW+ and VPW−) excitation,
representing the oscillation of virtual pressure [VPr+] and [VPr−], correspond-
ingly.

1.3 Quantization of Secondary Bivacuum

In asymmetric secondary Bivacuum, existing in presence of inertial matter
or antimatter and ﬁelds, the dynamic equilibrium (1.1e) is shifted to the left or
to the right. However, ﬁnally all Bivacuum symmetry shifts (local, induced by
particles and nonlocal, corresponding to ﬁelds) compensate each other in order
to keep in force the energy conservation law (see section 11.4).

For secondary Bivacuum the eqs.(1.2a), characterizing the energies of asym-
metric rotors and antirotors of BV F l and BV B±, corresponding to three lep-
tons generation (i = e, µ, τ ), looks like:

For our case:
The value of energetic gap between similarly excited rotor and antirotor

remains unchanged and equal to (1.3 and 1.3a).

However, the local energy of asymmetric BV F l and BV B±, composing
secondary Bivacuum, as a sum of (10.10 and 10.10a), in contrast to primordial
one (see 1.2c), is nonzero and dependent on the sign of vacuum shift (+ or −),
related in turn, to matter or antimatter excess in Bivacuum:

1.4 Virtual Particles and Antiparticles

Generally accepted diﬀerence of virtual particles from the actual ones, is that
the former, in contrast to latter, does not follow the laws of relativist mechanics:

m =

m0
1 − ( v

c )2

±

(cid:2)

1/2

(cid:3)

(1.15)

and, consequently, the Dirac’s equation.

For actual free particle with rest mass (m0) and relativist mass (m), the

Dirac’s formula, leading from (1.15) is:

E2 − −→p 2c2 = m2

0c4

(1.16)

where E2 = (mc2)2 is the total energy squared and p = mv is the momen-

tum of particle.

For virtual particles and photons the Dirac’s equality (1.16) is not valid. It
means that there are no velocity, momentum and energy limitations for virtual
particles and antiparticles.

For example, as a result of [electron - proton] interaction, mediated by vir-
tual photons, the electron and proton total energies do not change. Only the
directions of their momentums are changed.

In this case the energy of virtual photon in the Dirac’s equation E = 0 and:

E2 − −→p 2c2 = −−→p 2c2 < 0

The measure of virtuality (Vir) is a measure of Dirac’s relation validity:

(Vir) ∼ | m2

0c4 − (E2 − −→p 2c2) |≥ 0

In contrast to actual particles, the virtual ones have a more limited radius
of action. The more is the virtuality (Vir), the lesser is the radius. Each of
emitted virtual quantum must be absorbed by the same wave B or another.

A lot of process in quantum electrodynamics can be illustrated by Feynman
diagrams (Feynman, 1985). In these diagrams, actual particles are described
as inﬁnitive rays (lines) and virtual particles as stretches connecting these lines
(Fig. 1).

Each peak (or angle) in Feynman diagrams means emission or absorption of
quanta or particles. The energy of each process (electromagnetic, weak, strong)
is described using correspondent ﬁne structure constants.

It is shown in section above, that the symmetric excitations: BVB±,
BVF↑ and BVF↓ may have a broad spectra of radiuses and energetic gaps,
determined by the energy and eﬀective mass of excitations. This means the
existence of fractal hierarchic structure of Bivacuum,
as a superposition of
diﬀerent circulations, pairs of torus or vortices.

The transmission of signal in form of nonresonant Bivacuum gap oscillation
(BvO), propagating in Bivacuum without origination/annihilation of pairs of
virtual particles and antiparticles is instant. The inﬁnitive velocity of signal
transmission is a result of nonlocal properties of any kind of Bose condensate:
actual or virtual, as was demonstrated in section 1.2.

Signals in form of BvO in the volume of virtual Bose condensate of BVF and
BVB± are not related with energy-momentum transmission. However, they
may modulate the virtual pressure waves (VPW±) of Bivacuum.
it may be
responsible for nonlocal component of Bivacuum.

1.5 Virtual Pressure Waves (VPW±) in Bivacuum

The creation of virtual particles and antiparticles in our model is a result
of certain combinations of virtual clouds (VC+
j,k).
Virtual clouds and anticlouds represent a correlated transitions between dif-
ferent excitation states (j, k) of rotors (V +
form-

j,k) and anticlouds (VC−

j,k) and antirotors (V −

Comparing this formula with expression for quantum potential (Q = mc2)
in Sidharch’s (1998) interpretation (5) for the case, when m = m0, we can see
that they coincide. It means that in the framework of our theory the nonlocal
quantum potential of Bohm is equal to energy of most probable virtual clouds
(VC±). In huge domains of virtual Bose condensation of secondary Bivacuum the
VC± may be modulated by nonlocal Bivacuum symmetry oscillation (BvSO).
We may suppose, that quantum beats between the excited states [j and k]
of BV B±
k may lead to creation/annihilation of pairs of neutral
virtual bosons and antibosons. The similar transitions between BV F l
and
j
BV F l
k correspond to creation/annihilation of pars of charged virtual fermions.
The process of [creation ⇋ annihilation] of virtual clouds and their super-
position in form of virtual particles, - should be accompanied by oscillation of
virtual pressure (VP ±) in form of positive and negative virtual pressure waves
(VPW + and VPW −).

j and BV B±

In primordial Bivacuum the virtual pressure waves: VPW+ and VPW−
totally compensate each other. However, in asymmetric secondary Bivacuum,
in presence of matter and ﬁelds such compensation is absent and the resulting
pressure of virtual particles or antiparticles becomes nonzero. This displays, for
example, in Casimir eﬀect.

In contrast to actual particles, the virtual ones may exist only in the wave
[W] phase, but not in corpuscular [C] phase (see Section 3). It is a reason, why
[VPW±] and their superposition do not obey the laws of relativist mechanics
and causality principle.

The [j ⇋ k]e,µ,τ transitions of rotors and antirotors should be accompanied
by electromagnetic (EM) dipole radiation with frequency of such transitions. In
accordance to our model of Bivacuum, the in-phase transitions [j ⇋ k]e,µ,τ of
rotors and antirotors are accompanied by in-phase oscillations of internal charges

17

(e±) of dipoles. As a result of corresponding EM pumping, the population of
higher (j) levels may get bigger, than the population of lower (k) levels (j > k).
Besides this pumping eﬀect, due to energy compensation in two compartments
of double cells, this inversion of population may (like in lasers) occur even
spontaneously.

This means that Bivacuum can be considered, as the active medium, where
double cells are the active elements. Consequently, VPW + and VPW − may
have a properties of three-dimensional (3D) autowaves. It is known from existing
theory of waves, that 3D autowaves can propagate in space, form rotating spiral
structures (reverberations) or have the stationary structures.

2 Creation of Elementary Particles and An-
tiparticles, as a Result of Bivacuum Dipoles
Symmetry Shift

2.1 Creation of Sub-Elementary Particles

The spontaneous or induced by external ﬁelds Bivacuum symmetry violation
is accompanied by sub-elementary particles and antiparticles creation. Shifting
the equality of positive and negative energy of Bivacuum to the left (eq.1.2) is
accompanied by the leftward shift of equilibrium (1.1). This symmetry breach
of Bivacuum fermions of positive and negative spins (S = ±1/2), turns them
in conditions of resonant energy exchange with Bivacuum, to sub-elementary
particles fermions (F+
l )i of three generation (i = e, µ, τ ):

pendent on direction of the axion ﬁeld rotation: clockwise or anticlockwise, as
respect to surface of Earth (i.e. maximum of gravitational potential). The elec-
trons, positrons and photons also can be created by the axion-ﬁeld generator
due to corresponding combination of the excited by generator sub-elementary

The isolated Bivacuum fermions and antifermions do not interact with pho-
tons, however, they are changing the curvature of Bivacuum, like the triplets
of sub-elementary particles. This means that their nonhomogeneous density
distribution could be responsible for ’dark’ matter gravitational eﬀects.

direction of particles external momentum, the sub-elementary particle F+

The symmetry of our Bivacuum as respect to probability of elementary par-
ticles and antiparticles creation, makes it principally diﬀerent from asymmetric
Dirac’s vacuum (1958), with its realm of negative energy saturated with elec-
trons. Positrons in his model represent the ’holes’, originated as a result of
the electrons jumps to realm of positive energy. Currently it is clear, that the
Dirac’s model of vacuum is not general enough to explain all know experimental
data, for example, the bosons emergency.

The law of energy conservation keeps the total energy of [secondary Bivac-
uum + energy of sub-elementary particles] unchanged and equal to zero, like in
primordial Bivacuum:

The localized Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift in [F±

of diﬀerent angular velocities of rotor and antirotor, leading due to relativist
eﬀect to generation of uncompensated inertial mass of sub-elementary parti-
cles/antiparticles and of the additional to kinetic energy of particles, related to
their longitudinal and transversal zero-point vibrations.

The Bivacuum energy symmetry conservation (section 11.4) means the com-
pensation of corresponding local energy shifts of rotor and antirotor of (n = N )
sub-elementary particles/antiparticles:

This means, that the total energy of Bivacuum in the process of matter
creation, remains unchanged and equal to zero due to symmetry compensation
processes. The gravitational and electromagnetic potentials of the charged par-
ticles, in fact, represent such nonlocal reaction of the space properties on their
longitudinal and transversal zero-point vibrations, in accordance of energy and
charge conservation laws.

2.3 Conservation Rules for sub-Elementary Particles, as

a Mass, Magnetic and Electric Dipoles

Two internal conservation rules, responsible for stability of sub-elementary
particles and antiparticles (fermions and bosons), forming elementary particles
of all three generations (i = e, µ, τ ), are postulated in our Uniﬁed Model (UM):
I. Conservation of the actual (measurable) and complementary (inaccessible
for direct measurement) internal kinetic energies of vortex and rotor, corre-
spondingly in form of equality of modules of actual

The ﬁrst eq. (2.23) coincides with those, obtained by Dirac. The second
(2.23a) for complementary energy is a new one and reﬂects the generalization
of special theory of relativity and Dirac’s theory for relativist particles.

From (2.13; 2.11a and 2.20) follows the internal actual & complementary

charge compensation principle, symmetric to mass compensation principle:

(cid:12)

or :
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

|e+e−| = (e)2

(2.24)

(2.24a)

The positive actual and negative complementary internal negative charges:

[e+] and [i2e−], correspond to vortex and rotor of sub-elementary fermions.

The logic of our Uniﬁed model demands the exchange of conventional nota-
tions of negative and positive charge for electron and positron or fermions and
antifermions, as deﬁned by the sign of their actual mass. From the left part
of (2.13) we can see, that the internal actual charge (e+) and actual magnetic
moment (µ+) of sub-elementary particle of the electron with positive actual
mass (+m+
C ) is convenient to deﬁne as ”positive”. For the other hand the
uncompensated sub-elementary antifermion of the positron with actual mass
−m−
is natural to consider as a carrier of ”negative” internal charge (e−)
C
and the internal negative magnetic moment (µ−). Consequently, the resulting,
(cid:0)
experimentally measurable, charges of the electron and positron from (2.24a)
we deﬁne, as:

(cid:1)

e+ = +

|e+| |e−|

and

e− = −

|e+| |e−|

(2.25)

It is evident, that such convenient for our presentation exchange of notations
of charge of particles (e+) and antiparticles (e−) do not aﬀect the conventional
theories of classical and quantum electrodynamics in any way.

It is important to note, that positive (2.1) and negative (2.1a) Bivacuum

For sub-elementary particles such characteristics as: mass: m+

vation.

For sub-elementary antiparticles the notions of actual and complementary
characteristics change their place. The mass of negative realm of Bivacuum
became actual and measurable: m−
C = m0/[1 − (v/c)2]1/2, as well as charge (e−)
and magnetic moment (µ−). The corresponding complementary characteristics
of sub-elementary antiparticles in realm of positive energy of Bivacuum: m+
C =
i2m0[1 − (v/c)2]1/2; (e+) and (µ+) turns to inaccessible for direct experiment.
One can see, that the rest mass squared (2.7) and resulting charge squared
they are

(2.11a) are not dependent on the external group velocity ( v), i.e.
relativist invariants.

3 Duality, as a Result of Quantum Beats Be-
tween the Actual and Complementary States
of sub-Elementary Particles

Duality of elementary particles and antiparticles in accordance to Uniﬁed
model, is a consequence of coherent quantum beats of their sub-elementary
particles/antiparticles between two states:
the asymmetrically excited state
(BV F l)∗ ≡ F±

l and its symmetric state (BV F l):

CV C
⇋ BV F l

F±
l

(cid:20)

i

(cid:21)

(3.1)

where: i means three electron’s or positron’s generation: i = e, µ, τ.
These beats are accompanied by [emission ⇋ absorption] of cumulative vir-
tual cloud (CVC) of sub-quantum particles, representing [W] phase of sub-
elementary particle, oscillation of the mass and charge symmetry shift.

As far the energy of symmetric BV F l is equal to zero, it means that the
l ] is equal

energy of corpuscular [C] phase, in form of sub-elementary particle [F±
to energy of the wave [W] phase, in form of [CVC]: EC = EW .

The energy of quantum beats in a course of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of sub-
elementary particle is equal to diﬀerence of energy between the absolute values
of actual (vortex) and complementary (rotor) states. Using eqs. (2.8 and 2.8a),
we get the energy of sub-elementary de Broglie wave in [C] and [W] phase, its re-
lation to de Broglie wave frequency (ω0 = ωC⇋W )i and the wave length (λC,W ),
equal in both phase, as a sum of rotational and two translational contributions:

The set of these expressions, in fact, unify the extended special theory of rel-
ativity with quantum mechanics, elucidating the fundamental root of quantum
physics: corpuscle - wave duality of particles.

Our dynamic presentation of duality explains also the elementary particles,
as the permanent sources of electromagnetic and gravitational energy. Such
a ’perpetual mobile’ properties of particles, as a mass, electric and magnetic
dipoles, are the result of permanent energy redistribution between the negative
and positive vacuums of the asymmetric secondary Bivacuum in a course of
dipoles [C ⇋ W ] pulsation.

3.1 The Kangaroo Eﬀect
Propagation of elementary fermion, like electron: h[F +
in 3D
space, accompanied by [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of all three sub-elementary particles,
can be considered as a periodic jumping of its uncompensated sub-elementary
particle [F −
l i in form of CVC of [W] phase with light velocity between the
”anchor sites”- Bivacuum fermions (BVFl), i.e. unexcited double cells. The
binding of CVC to the anchor BVFl, corresponds to [C] phase restoration, i.e.
double cell asymmetric excitation. In general case elementary fermion in [C]
phase moves with group velocity (v), lower than light one (c), pertinent for [W ]
phase. Such jump-way process of particle propagation in space may be termed
the KANGAROO EFFECT [KE].

tion. This dynamic wave process is correlated with ’jumps’ of uncompensated
[F−

of ’jumps’ is determined by the actual component of de Broglie wave (wave B)

Propagation of the photon in Bivacuum occur with light velocity in both
phase: [W] and [C] due to symmetry of this elementary boson structure, unper-
turbing Bivacuum symmetry shift.

Our Uniﬁed model (UM) has some similarity with theory, developed by
Krasnoholvets (2000). He regarded a vacuum also as a cellular space, each cell
representing a ’superparticle’ with dimension of 10−28 cm. Interaction of moving
actual particle with superparticles is accompanied by emission and absorption
of elementary virtual excitations - inertons by particle. Interesting to note, that
in his model the ratio of the inertons cloud amplitude to the length of wave B
of particle is the same, as the ratio of CVC amplitude to its length in our UM
(3.4).

3.2 Spatial images of sub-elementary particles in [C] and

The spatial images of sub-elementary wave B in [C] and [W] phase can be
analyzed in terms of the wave numbers or energy distribution, if we transform

The [W] phase in form of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) originates as a
result of quantum beats between actual and complementary states of [C] phase
of elementary wave B. Consequently, the spatial image of CVC energy distri-

of actual [C+] state as an equilateral hyperbola and that of [C−] state as a
complementary circle. After subtraction of left and right parts of (3.5 and 3.6)

A spatial image of the wave [W] phase (Fig.3), in form of cumulative virtual

2001a).

The [W] phase in form of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) originates as
a result of quantum beats between actual and complementary states of [C]
phase. Consequently, the spatial image of CVC can be considered as a geometric
diﬀerence between images of [C+] and [C−] state.

Fig. 3. The parted (two-cavity) hyperboloid is a spatial image
of twin cumulative virtual cloud 2[CVC±], corresponding to [W]
phase of sub-elementary particle and sub-elementary antiparticle.
It characterize the twofold CVC± of positive and negative energy,
corresponding to [W] phase of pair (sub-elementary fermion + sub-
↑ ⊲⊳ F+

↓ ], as a general symmetric part
of the electron, positron, photon and quarks (Kaivarainen, 2001a).

For the external observer, the primordial Bivacuum looks like a isotropic sys-
tem of 3D double cells with shape of two hemispheres, separated by energetic
gap. There are three kinds of like quasi-spherical double cells with three Comp-
ton radiuses, corresponding to the rest mass of three electron’s generation:
i = e, µ, τ and the external group velocity, equal to zero (vext
gr ≡ v = 0). The
spatial immobilization of double cells provide their zero external momentum
and conditions of virtual Bose condensation in Bivacuum (1.4), related directly
to its nonlocal properties. However, the dimensions of double cells are pulsating
in a course of virtual clouds (VC±) exchange and pairs of virtual particles and
antiparticles creation and annihilation.

In secondary Bivacuum, in presence of matter and ﬁelds, the shape of double
cells becomes less symmetrical. When double cell transforms to sub-elementary
fermion or antifermion as a result of asymmetric excitation, one of two hemi-
spheres deforms towards hemiellipsoid, containing the 3D vortex of sub-quantum
particles, while the other one keeps its 2D rotor shape (Fig. 4).

Asymmetric double cells in form of [vortex + rotor] dipoles, representing
sub-elementary particles, get the ability to move as respect to symmetric ones
with external group velocity vext
gr > 0. The pulsation between such asymmetric
(excited) and former symmetric (ground) shape of double cells represents, in
accordance to our Uniﬁed model, the [corpuscle (C) ⇋ wave (W)] transitions.
These transitions are accompanied by jump-way propagation of triplets of asym-
metrically excited double cells in certain combinations, representing elementary
particles.

The existence of diﬀerent 3D structures of virtual autowaves, formed by
VPW±, modulated by external EM, gravitational ﬁelds and matter dynamics,
are also the important feature of secondary Bivacuum. The notion of Virtual
Replica (VR) of condensed matter is introduced (Kaivarainen, 2001d), as a 3D
autowaves in Bivacuum, modulated by matter dynamics.

We may consider the [actual vortex + complementary rotor], corresponding
to spatial image of [C] phase of sub-elementary particle (Kaivarainen, 2000;
2001a; 2002), as a two vortices of diﬀerent shape and frequency (ω+

or taking into account (2.3b and 2.11a) we get the important interrelation
between the actual and complementary mass and charge of the asymmetric

group velocity (v):

4.1 Criteria of the Absolute External Velocity and Mo-

The mass symmetry shift at Golden mean conditions

We came to important result from (4.7), that at Golden mean (GM) con-

accordance to our model, is deﬁned by uncompensated sub-elementary particles
in triplets (4.7a).

The frequency of particles [C ⇋ W ] pulsation at Golden mean (GM) condi-

The charge symmetry shift at Golden mean conditions

Using the electromagnetic ﬁne structure constant:

get from (4.9) for the actual and complementary charges at GM conditions:

|e+|φ =

|e−|φ =
|e−|φ = (αφ)1/2Q

α1/2
φ1/2 Q

The diﬀerence between the absolute values of actual and complementary

charges at GM conditions, is:

|∆e±|φ = |e+|φ − |e−|φ = φe

It was taken into account here that: 1/φ − 1 = φ.
Dividing the charge symmetry shift (4.10) to the mass symmetry shift (4.8)
and using (4.7b), we get the reduced charge symmetry shift at GM conditions,
as a constant:

potential of elementary charge is a result of the energy exchange (quantum
beats) between the negative and positive vacuums.

The ratio of energies at Golden mean conditions

The known formula, unifying the ratio of phase and group velocity of rela-
tivist de Broglie wave (vph/v) with ratio of its potential energy to kinetic one
(VB/Tk) is:

2

vph
v

− 1 =

VB
Tk

(4.12)

It is easy to see from (4.6 and 4.9), that at GM condition (vph/v)φ = 1/φ,

the ratio:

(VB/Tk)φ = 2.236 and [Tk/(Tk + VB)]φ = [Tk/EB]φ = 0.309

(4.13)

The Golden mean (GM) conditions for sub-elementary particles, composing
free elementary particles, most probably are the result of their fast rotation at
GM frequency, determined by the resonant interaction with Harmonization force
of Bivacuum. Such GM spinning of sub-elementary particles in triplets, when
their internal and external group and phase velocities coincide, like in eq.(4.4),
is responsible for such fundamental parameters as the rest mass of elementary
particles, their spin and the actual charge. In our new interpretation the rest
mass corresponds to conditions, when the translational external group velocity
is equal to zero (vext

gr )tr ≡ (v)tr → 0.

However, due to quantum zero-point oscillations, the minimum translational

group velocity always is a bit more, than zero (see sections 7 and 10).

We may introduce here the ”Dead mean” conditions, corresponding to
thermal equilibrium and maximum of entropy. At this conditions any system
can be described by the number of independent harmonic oscillators, unable to
self-organization:

(4.14)

The deep quantum roots of Golden mean, reﬂecting realization of conditions
of Hidden Harmony (5.7), leading from our dynamic model of wave-particle
duality, explain the universality of this number (S = 0.618).

We put forward a hypothesis, that any kind of selected system, able to
self-assembly, self-organization and evolution: from atoms to living organisms
or from galactics to Universe - are tending to conditions of Hidden Harmony,
as a background of Golden Mean realization. The less is deviation of ratio
of characteristic parameters of system from [φ ≡ P hi], the more advanced is
evolution of this system. We have to keep in mind that all forms of matter are
composed from hierarchic system of de Broglie waves.

Our statement

tendency of any system (from elementary par-
that
ticle to the Universe)
is a driving force
to Hidden Harmony (HH)
and ﬁnal goal of evolution is conﬁrmed on the lot of examples (see:
http://soulinvitation.com/indexdw.html). The state of system, corresponding to
HH, do not coincide in general case with thermal equilibrium state of maximum
entropy, as a ﬁnal one, postulated by classical thermodynamics.

We deﬁne Harmonization force (HaF) of Bivacuum, generated by virtual pres-
i), as a force, driving the
sure waves (VPW±) of fundamental frequency (ω0
[C ⇋ W ] pulsation frequency of the elementary particles (electrons, quarks) of
all three generation (i = e, µ, τ ) to the Golden mean (GM) frequency:

Consequently, the other parameters of particles, like energy, actual and com-
plementary mass, group and phase velocities, momentum and de Broglie wave
length also tend to GM conditions (see eqs. 4.7 - 4.7f).

The mechanism of HaF action on matter is related to induced synchroniza-
tion/resonance between fundamental frequencies (ω0)i (see eqs.1.1 and 1.1a)
of Bivacuum virtual pressure waves (VPW±) and frequency of [C ⇋ W ] pul-
l ]i of sub-elementary particles of matter,
sation of symmetric pairs [F+
due to [Bivacuum ⇋ M atter] exchange interaction by means of virtual clouds
(VC±). The strong correlation between [C ⇋ W ] dynamics of symmetric pair
[F+

in triplets h[F−

5.1 New Deﬁnition of the Rest Mass of Particles

The HaF of Bivacuum, keeping the particles in GM condition, looks to be one of
the main factors, responsible for fundamental properties of elementary particles,
like the rest mass, spin, charge and stability of atoms and molecules (see section
10).

We can present the total energy of elementary particle as a sum of rotational

and two kinds of translational contributions:

where the resonant angle frequency of HaF of Bivacuum (ωi

equal to that of Golden mean (4.8) for three generation (i = e, µ, τ ); the radius
of resulting double vortices of uncompensated sub-elementary particle is equal
to Compton radius of corresponding electrons generation (Li

vφ
rot = cφ1/2 = 0.786151377 c is the Golden mean group velocity of particle.
Two types of translational contributions: longitudinal ( k tr) and transverse
( ⊥ tr 6) ones are the additional vibration energies to Golden mean rotational
kinetic energy. The longitudinal vibrations occur in line with external group
velocity of elementary particle. The transverse vibrations occur in direction,
normal to longitudinal ones.

It is postulated in our theory, that the energy of longitudinal ( k tr) transla-
tional zero-point vibrations of elementary charge is responsible for electromag-
netic potential (Eel). The energy of its transverse ( ⊥ tr 6) zero-point vibrations
is responsible for gravitational potential (EG) :

In our Uniﬁed model, the rest mass of elementary fermion of any of three
generation is deﬁned in a double way: as a diﬀerence between the actual and
complementary masses, generated by diﬀerence in group and phase velocities,
corresponding to Golden mean conditions (4.7a and 4.7e), and the square root
of their product:

In accordance to our theory, at condition (5.9), corresponding to condition of
primordial Bivacuum (4.2b) of the ideal symmetry, the matter and ﬁelds can’t
exist at all, as far the energy of beats between the actual and complementary
states of double cells-dipoles is equal to zero.

After Uniﬁed model, all deviations of the mass of rest or ’Golden mean mass’
and the variation of the de Broglie wave length of elementary particles are the
result of their additional translational kinetic energy (Etr, see 5.7), provided
by zero-point oscillation or the external ﬁelds or particles.

It is known, that the competition and synchronization in dissipative nonequi-
librium mediums under the inﬂuence of external periodical force, like HaF, often
leads to spatial and temporal self-organization of these mediums, i.e. crystals,
water, etc. (Kaivarainen, 2000).

The HaF may direct the evolution of DNA, proteins, cells and the whole

organisms to Golden mean conditions.

It leads from our theory, that the ﬁnal goal of self-organization and Evolution,
corresponding to fulﬁlment of Golden mean conditions on the all hierarchical
levels of matter, diﬀers from state of maximum of entropy and ”Thermal Death”
of the Universe. The latter corresponds to condition of independent harmonic
oscillators, when the average kinetic and potential energy are equal to each other.
(V /T k)φ =2.236 of potential energy to
It is quite diﬀerent from the ratio:
kinetic one (see eq.4.10), determined by Golden Mean.

5.2 The Principle of Least Action and the Time Problem

It follows from our model, that the Action in Lagrange form can be presented
as a diﬀerence between external and permanent internal kinetic energy of sub-
elementary particles:

Comparing (5.11) with our formula for Harmonization force and energy

(5.1a and 5.2a), we can see, that the HaF may be responsible for realization
of Principle of Least action.

Applying of Principle of Least Action, as a minimum of the S variation to
(5.10) and taking into account that, δ[m0c2] = 0, we get the uniﬁcation of pace

E = 2Tk get us to the same result for pace of time (dt/t = d ln t = −d ln Tk),
as (5.13).

Cvext

gr ).

Our understanding of time, based on eq.(5.13), leads to deﬁnition: ”Time
for any closed nonequilibrium or oscillating physical system is a parameter,
characterizing the pace of this system kinetic energy change”(Kaivarainen, 2002;
2001). This means that Hierarchy of closed system - from the molecule to
Universe determines the corresponding hierarchy of time-scales.

Increasing the external velocity of system, accompanied by increasing of its
kinetic energy, corresponds to decreasing of pace of time in total accordance
with special theory of relativity.

In accordance to our model, the characteristic time for any closed system
(ti), including the Universe, is positive, if the kinetic energy, including the actual
mass of this system Mi and its velocity is decreasing and negative in the opposite
case:

ti = −

Tk
dTk/dt

= −

1
d ln Tk/dt

(5.14)

It is important to note, that the entropy of system increasing with tempera-
ture is accompanied by the increasing of kinetic energy of its elements/particles.
Consequently, in accordance to our approach, dissipation and disorganization of
system mean negative course of time. For the other hand, decreasing of kinetic
energy of particle with temperature decreasing, usually mean increasing of its
potential energy of interaction with each other, leading to particles association
and Bose condensation.

We may conclude, that time is positive for selected condensed matter system,
if this system is tending to self-organization and evolution, decreasing its internal
kinetic energy and increasing potential energy. In the opposite case time for this
system is negative. In other words, decreasing of entropy means positive course
of time and increasing - the negative course of time. This conclusion do not
contradict to Prigogin’s concept of time, related to entropy change.

6 The Nature of Uncertainty Principle, Spins

and Pauli Principle

In this section such phenomena as uncertainty principle, spin, Pauli principle,
the origination of bosons from pairs of fermions will be analyzed.

43

One of the basic laws of quantum mechanics, the principle of uncertainty,

reﬂecting the corpuscle-wave duality, may be expressed in two forms:

(∆q)2(∆p)2 ≥

2

~

2

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(∆t)2(∆E)2 ≥ ~2

(6.1)

(6.2)

where: ∆q and ∆p are uncertainties in simultaneous experimental determina-
tions of the coordinate and momentum of wave B; ∆t and ∆E are uncertainties
of time and energy of wave B in conditions of their simultaneous experimental
evaluation.

The reason of this uncertainty is the incompatibility in time of two param-
eters in the left parts of (6.1 and 6.2) in a course of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of
sub-elementary particles and perturbation of these parameters in a course of
measurements. In the selected [W] and instant [C] phase we cannot detect si-
multaneously the momentum and position of the electron [(F +
],
as well as its life-time and energy, determined by uncompensated sub-elementary
particle

(cid:17)

The notion of time (t) and momentum (p) is pertinent only for corpuscular
[C] phase, but not for the [W] phase, because both of them are related with
actual mass and velocity measurement.

For the other hand, in [W] phase, realized in form of cumulative virtual

The hidden energy of elementary wave B, equal in the [C] and [W] phase,

The external measurable energy of particle is equal to Eext = m+
In so-called coherent form, inequalities (6.1 and 6.2) turns to equality.
Using parameters, introduced in our dynamic model, we get the generalized
form for (6.2), turning the inequality to equality:

The similar replacement of the only external parameters of wave B by their
total parameters, including the internal (hidden) ones, turns inequality (6.1) to
equality:

This means that impossibility of simultaneous precise experimental evalua-
tion of the momentum and position of elementary particle is a result of alterna-
tion between two time-separated [W] and [C] phase of particle and contribution
of hidden parameters of de Broglie wave (wave B).

The elementary particles (fermions like electrons and positrons) in our model
are not mathematical points, but can be strongly delocalized in space of Bivac-
uum.

The uncertainty in deﬁnition of particle localization (∆q) is equal to diﬀer-

In fact, these conditions coincide with condition of inﬁnitive virtual Bose

At v = c, we have ∆q = 0.
In general case at c > v > 0,

the nonlocal/non-point properties of parti-
its relatively big hidden dimensions, determines the uncertainty of its

cle, i.e.
localization in space. It is true for the both [C] and [W] phase.

In general case spin (J) is a quantum number in units of (~), reﬂecting
the internal dynamics of elementary particles and number of projections of in-
ternal angular momentum on any selected direction of space. The number of
corresponding spin states is equal to 2J + 1. Consequently, at J = 1/2 we
have two possible states of the fermions. They corresponds to two directions
(projections) of round cone rotation (spins) as respect to direction of particle
propagation (S = ± 1
2 ), i.e. clockwise and anticlockwise.

Fermions follow Fermi-Dirac’s statistics. Our model predicts that all
fermions, in contrast to bosons, contain ”uncompensated” sub-elementary par-
ticle, violating the symmetry of Bivacuum.

The integer spin of boson, like photon, is equal to J = 1 and that of π and
K−mesons, equal to J = 0. Bosons do not violate the Bivacuum symmetry due
to ”compensating” eﬀect in pairs of coherent [sub-elementary fermion (F −
l ) +
sub-elementary antifermion (F +

l )] and follow the Bose-Einstein statistics.

The spin, equal to 1, means that three projections of internal angular mo-

mentum on any selected direction of space: +1; 0; -1 are possible.

For bosons with spin J = 0, only one situation is possible, when two
[vortex − rotor] dipoles of sub-elementary fermions and sub-elementary an-
tifermion of coherent pair (F −
l ) rotate in antiphase to each other. The
projection of internal resulting angular momentum of such pair on any selected
direction of space is equal to zero (S = 0).

It is known fact, that the total rotating cycle for electron or positron spin
is not 3600, but 7200, i.e. double turn by external magnetic ﬁeld of special
conﬁguration is necessary to bring the electron to the starting state (Davies,
1985).

This surprising result may be a consequence of double spatial structure,
like [vortex + rotor] dipole of [C] phase of uncompensated sub-elementary
antifermion of the electron/positron, responsible for its charge and spin. For
this end we have to assume, that direction of rotation in external magnetic ﬁeld
of both: actual vortex and complementary rotor of uncompensated
,
that determines a sign of spin, is changing separately: one after another with

6.2 Pauli principle: How it works?

Let us consider the reasons why the Pauli principle is ”working” for fermions
and is not working for bosons. The total energy of sub-elementary particles,
forming elementary fermions and bosons does not change in a course of [corpus-
cle ⇔ wave] transitions:

where:

EB = ~ωB

ωB = (m+

C − m−

C )c2/~

(6.13)

(6.13a)

is a hidden frequency of de Broglie wave, equal to frequency of quantum

beats between actual and complementary states of sub-elementary particles.

In corpuscular [C] phase both fermions and bosons, including photons, have
spatially localized instant masses (m+
C and m−
C ) and they do not inﬂuence the
equilibrium of positive and negative virtual pressure. As a result, the excessive
virtual pressure (∆V P ±) is zero:

∆V P ± = V P +

C − V P −

C = 0

In contrast to [C] phase, the properties of fermions and bosons in the [W]

phase in form of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) are principally diﬀerent.

l + F−

forming bosons,

In accordance to our model of elementary particles, the number of sub-
elementary fermions and sub-elementary antifermions,
is
equal. Each of sub-elementary fermion and sub-elementary antifermion in sym-
metric pairs (F+
l ) of bosons change their [corpuscular ⇔ wave] states in
the in-phase manner. It means that the density of ”positive” and ”negative”
virtual quanta, related to CVC + and CVC − [absorption ⇋ emission], oscillate
equally, compensating each other. Consequently, the symmetry of vac-
uum energy density remains unperturbed. The kind of ”Bivacuum symmetry
compensation eﬀect” take a place in a course of
[C ⇋ W ] pulsation of
bosons. The interaction (repulsion) between bosons is small, as far the exces-
sive virtual pressure does not change in a course of their [C ⇋ W ] pulsation
(∆V P ± = const).

49

For the other hand, the number of sub-elementary particles and sub-
elementary antiparticles in composition of fermions is not equal to each
other, in contrast to that of bosons. Consequently, the Bivacuum virtual
pressure oscillation in realms of positive and negative vacuum, accompanied
the cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) emission/absorption in the process of
[C ⇋ W ] pulsation of the excessive sub-elementary fermions/antifermions is not
compensated. It leads to asymmetric oscillations of Bivacuum virtual quanta
density, pressure and density of virtual energy.

This excessive virtual quanta pressure (∆V P ±), determines the spatial in-
compatibility and strong repulsing of two separate fermions with the same spins.
To explain this eﬀect, we have to postulate, that the elementary fermions of the
same spin have the same phase of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation.

If we accept this postulate, then the Pauli repulsion eﬀect between fermions
of the same spins is similar to that of excluded volume, provided by incompat-
ibility of two CVC in space and time. It is a result of the diﬀerence between
virtual quanta density (pressure) of ”positive” and ”negative” vacuum in space
between fermions of similar spins, violating Bivacuum symmetry.

In accordance to our model, the reason of the electromagnetic repulsion
between similar charges (see next Chapter) and Pauli repulsion is the same -
asymmetric distribution of positive and negative virtual quanta density, leading
to excessive virtual pressure. However, the Pauli repulsion [εP ] is much stronger
than electromagnetic one [εel]. Their diﬀerence is determined by the ratio of
total charge of the electron squared, introduced as Q2 = ~c to electromagnetic
charge squared, equal to reciprocal value of ﬁne structure constant:

=

(6.14)

[εP ]
[εel]

~c
e2 = 1/α ≃ 137
For the other hand, if the spins of two sub-elementary and elementary
fermions are opposite or they are localized in opposite energetic realms
like in elementary bosons (photons), and complex bosons,
of Bivacuum,
(atoms), then their [C ⇋ W ] oscillations are counterphase and their CVC do not
overlap and the eﬀect of excluded volume is absent. In this situation fermions
are spatially compatible. Such dynamic system did not increase the existing
already diﬀerence between positive and negative virtual quanta density. Also, it
did not change the vacuum symmetry shift. Consequently, the Pauli repulsion
is absent for this case of Bosons and Cooper pairs.

In composition of elementary neutral boson, like photon, virtual quanta
with total energy of CVC: EW = (m+
C − m−
C )c2, emitted as a result of C → W
transition of one of sub-elementary fermion, is absorbed by sub-elementary an-
tifermion with the opposite spin and charge in a course of its W → C transition
at the same semiperiod. The nonzero momentum of pair (F +
↑ ) with sim-
↑
ilar spins of sub-elementary fermions in structure of photon (Fig. 3) could be
a driving force of its luminal propagation in Bivacuum.

✶ F −

A sub-elementary fermions of the same spin state, but opposite charge are
compatible, because their CVC+ and CVC− exist simultaneously, but in oppo-
site realms of positive and negative energy of Bivacuum.

50

Consequently, the Pauli principle reﬂects the eﬀect of ”excluded volume” and
repulsion in a system of fermions with the same spins and in-phase [C → W ]
transitions. It is a result of asymmetric excess of virtual quanta density and
pressure in space between fermions as respect to outer space. The fermions of the
same spin, but diﬀerent energy, have diﬀerent frequency of [C → W ] pulsation.
This decoherence makes possible a compatibility of their CVC in space-time.

At the counterphase [C ⇔ W] transitions of two sub-elementary
fermions with opposite spins, following by quantum beats between

of sub-elementary antifermion F + also change its phase and spin.
It happens due to exchange interaction (attraction) between sub-
elementary particles by means of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC).
The spin state change of one uncompensated sub-elementary fermion
(F −

change of spins in coherent pair [F −

lated spin inversions of sub-elementary particles/antiparticles occur
in positron [2F +

positrons the spin-spin exchange interaction between unipolar sub-
elementary particles/antiparticles is stronger, than electromagnetic

particles systems have a properties of bosons with (S = 0), like Cooper pairs.

6.4 Bosons as a coherent system of sub-elementary and

elementary fermions

The spatial image of the main unit of elementary boson (Fig. 6) could be
presented as a superposition of two (vortex - rotor) dipoles, representing pair
[sub-elementary fermion + sub-elementary antifermion] with opposite charge
and the same spin states. In general case the elementary bosons are composed
from the integer number of such pairs.

Bosons have a zero or integer spin (0, 1, 2 . . . ) in the ~ units, in contrast to
the half integer spins of fermions. In general case, bosons with S = 1 include:
photons, gluons, mesons and boson resonances, phonons, pairs of elementary
fermions with opposite spins (i.e. Cooper pairs under the conditions of Bose-
condensation), atoms and molecules.

We subdivide bosons into two types:
1. Elementary bosons (like photons), composed from equal number of sub-
elementary fermions and antifermions, moving with light velocity in contrast to
complex bosons;

52

2. Complex bosons, represent a coherent system of elementary fermions

(electrons and nucleons), like neutral atoms and molecules.

Formation of stable complex bosons from elementary fermions of opposite
charge and same spins with diﬀerent actual masses: (m+
C )2 is possible
due to their electromagnetic attraction. It may occur, if the length of their waves
B are the same and equal to distance between them. This former condition
may be achieved by diﬀerence in their external group velocities, adjusting the
momentums to the same value:

C )1 6= (m+

L1 = ~/(m+
at : v1/vn = (m+

C v)1 = L2 = ~/(m+
C )n/(m+

C)1

Cv)2 . . . = Ln = ~/(m+

Cv)n

(6.15)

The mentioned above conditions are the base for assembly of complex bosons.
The hydrogen atom, composing from two fermions: electron and proton
is an example of complex microscopic complex bosons. The heavier atoms also
must follow the same principle.

Stability of microscopic asymmetric bosons: atoms and molecules is deter-
mined by the electromagnetic exchange by virtual photons as a part of CVC,
and by the similar wave B length of the electrons and nucleons.

The energies of boson are equal to the sum of the corresponding energies
of two constituent fermions, being simultaneously in corpuscular or wave phase
(Fig.8).

In accordance with our model, the elementary boson, such as photon, rep-
resents dynamic superposition of two triplets of sub-elementary fermions and
antifermions (Fig. 3), corresponding to electron and positron structures. Such
composition determines the resulting external charge of photon, equal to zero
and the value of photon’s spin: J = +1, 0 or -1.

Stability of all types of elementary particles: bosons and fermions (electrons,
positrons etc.) is due to exchange and attraction of cumulative virtual clouds
(CVC+ and CVC−) in the process of [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of sub-elementary
particles and sub-elementary antiparticles in pairs, like presented at Figs.7 and
8, correspondingly.

tary particles, like electrons, positrons, quarks and others.

The electromagnetic radiation by material object, increasing the virtual par-
ticles and antiparticles density, energy and charge, increase also the total vir-
tual energy density: εtot = ε+ + ε− (see eq. A31) and change permittivity
(ε0) and permeability [µ0 = (ε0c2)−1] of Bivacuum. The Coulomb interaction
is dependent on these parameters. It may inﬂuence polarizability of atoms and
molecules of the air around objects and their ionization potential. Consequently,
the characteristics of Kirlian picture (gas discharge) of the object may reﬂect
the properties of its Virtual Replica;

2. Making the VPW± more uniform due to coherent thermal dynamics of
molecules of matter in state of mesoscopic Bose condensation (mBC), providing
coherent [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of elementary particles, composing these molecules;
3. Changing the asymmetry of virtual energy density ∆εres = ε+ − ε−, as a
diﬀerence between energy densities of positive (ε+) and negative (ε−) vacuum.
Changing of Bivacuum symmetry shift (∆mV ) and value of ∆εres = ±(ε+−ε−),
related with
equilibrium shift, may be achieved by inﬂuence
of magnetic ﬁeld, radiated by body, on this equilibrium. This diﬀerence regula-

6.6 The Mystery of Sri Yantra Diagram

In accordance to ancient archetypal ideas, geometry and numbers describe the
fundamental energies in course of their dance - dynamics, transitions. For more
than ten millenniums it was believed that the famous Tantric diagram-Sri Yantra
contains basic functions active in the Universe (Fig. 7).

55

Fig. 7. The Sri Yantra diagram is composed from nine trian-
gles. Four of them are pointed up and ﬁve down. Author is grateful
to P. Flanagan for submitting of Sri Yantra diagram with precise
coordinates of most important points, making it possible the quan-
titative analysis.

Triangle is a symbol of a three-fold nature. The Christian trinity, the symbol
of God may be represented by triangle. In Buddhism-Hindu triangle with apex
up is a symbol of God-male and that with apex down is a symbol of God-
female.

We found out that Sri Yantra diagram can be considered as a symbolic lan-
guage, containing information about the mechanism of corpuscle-wave duality,
being the background of all kinds of fundamental interaction. Each of pair of
triangles [down+up] in terms of our model corresponds to positive and negative
parts of two-cavity hyperboloid (Fig. 4), describing spatial image of [W] phase of
the pair of [sub-elementary fermions (F+) + sub-elementary antifermions (F−)]

The numbers near the right side of pictures characterize the
energy of positive and negative energy sublevels of Bivacuum exci-
tation: EB = ±~ω(n + 1

2 ), where : n = 0, 1, 2...

Other important feature of Sri Yantra, compatible with our model of stand-
ing [(F+⊲⊳ F−)W ] in composition of electron, is Bivacuum symmetry shift, cor-
responding to this phase of triplet [(F+⊲⊳ F−)W + (F±)C ].

Asymmetry is obvious from position of central point of diagram, denoted on
Figs. (7) and (8a, 8b) as an open circle (o) and diamond shape of its nuclei,
composed from two triangles with common base and diﬀerent height.

It is interesting to note, that spatial position of central point (o), localized
in lower triangle of Sri Yantra diamond-nuclei as respect to its base and apex -
corresponds to Golden mean.

The degree of asymmetry of Sri Yantra decreases with increasing the distance
from its central point (o). For example, the shifts of zero-point positive and

57

negative vacuum sublevels, pointed on Fig. 8a:

+

~ω and −

~ω (n = 0)

(6.17)

as respect to central point (o) of Sri Yantra are characterized by ratio: 1.77. It
reﬂects the asymmetry of Bivacuum boson of secondary Bivacuum , perturbed
by matter. The less asymmetric shifts of higher sublevels with quantum num-
ber: n = 1, 2, 3, corresponding to positive and negative energies of vacuum
excitation: (±3/2)~ω; (±5/2)~ω and (±7/2)~ω are characterized by the fol-
lowing ratios of their distance from central point: 1.19; 1.1 and 1.046.

In terms of our model, this asymmetry of (F+⊲⊳ F−)W is related with
asymmetry of Bivacuum gap symmetry oscillation (BvSO), accompanied their
[C ⇋ W] pulsation. The asymmetry is produced by uncompensated sub-
elementary particle in composition of triplets [(F+⊲⊳ F−)W + (F±)C ].

The analogy between some features of ancient diagram and our wave-

corpuscle duality model is surprising indeed.

7 Calculation of Magnetic Moment of the Elec-

tron, Based on Uniﬁed Model

In this section the quantitative evidence in proof of our Uniﬁed model is pre-
sented.

We assume, that the diﬀerence between the actual magnetic moment of the
electron (see 2.4) [µe = e+~/(2m0c)] and the Bohr magneton [µB = e~/(2m0c)]
is deﬁned by small deviation (perturbation) of the actual electric charge (e+) of
Bivacuum fermions (BVFl) of secondary Bivacuum from the resulting charge
(e). This deviation of the properties of Bivacuum from the neutral ones, per-
tinent for primordial Bivacuum, is a result of zero-point oscillation of BVFl
and the electron. Corresponding asymmetry of the actual and complementary
charges of the virtual Bivacuum fermions is responsible for asymmetry of the
actual electron magnetic moment and the Bohr magneton.

Using (4.2), the ratio of µe to the Bohr magneton µB may be presented as:

µe
µB

=

=

e+
e

1
[1 − (v0/c)2]1/4 =

1
[1 − z2]1/4

& 1

(7.1)

The best coincidence between the experiment and (7.2) theory occurs, if we
assume, that zero-point velocity (v0/c)2 is deﬁned by product of the Golden
mean ratio φ = (v/c)2 = 0.6180339887 and the electromagnetic ﬁne structure
constant α = e2/~c = 0.0072973506 in form:

z = (αφ)1/2 = (v0/c) = 0.067156608

(7.2)

58

where (z) is a new dimensionless zero point factor, introduced in our Uniﬁed

model.

It looks, that (z) may serve as a new World constant, reﬂecting the asym-

metric properties of Bivacuum. In primordial symmetric Bivacuum v0 = 0.

From (7.2) the most probable zero-point velocity of the electron (v0), char-

acterizing its quantum zero-point oscillation, is related to light velocity as:

v0 = c z = c (αφ)1/2 = 2.99792458 × 108 m s−1 ·0.067156608 =

= 0.201330447 × 108 m s−1

(7.3)

(7.3a)

The magnetic moment of the electron, calculated using analytical expres-
sions (7.2 and 7.3) at zero-point condition (µUM = 1.001131 µB) coincides with
experimental value (µexp = 1.001159 µB) very well. The small diﬀerence may be
a consequence of screening of the electron’s charge by slightly asymmetric vir-
tual Bivacuum fermions (BVFl), as far their actual and complementary charges
do not totally compensate each other:
|e+ + e−| > 0. The latter eﬀect can
be evaluated by quantum electrodynamics (QED), using perturbation theory
(Feynman, 1985).

7.1 The Problem of Dirac’s Monopole

The Dirac’s theory of elementary magnetic charge (g), symmetric to electric one
(e), named monopole, leads to following relation between the monopole and
electric charge:

ge =

~c

n
2

where : n is the integer number

(7.4)

It follows from this deﬁnition that minimal magnetic charge (at n = 1) is
as big as g ∼= 67.7e. The mass of monopole should be huge ∼ 1016 GeV. All
numerous attempts to reveal such particles in experiment has failed.

Our model does not need monopole for explanation the symmetry of elec-
tromagnetism. The notion of monopole is replaced by that of magnetic dipole
of sub-elementary particles, symmetric to their electric dipole (see section 2.2).
It is shown in section (8.2), that on the distance, exceeding the dimensions of
dipoles, the electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld, radiated in a course of sub-elementary
particles (as the double - dipoles) [C ⇋ W ] pulsation, represents the spherical

Framework of Uniﬁed Model

It is assumed that the internal electromagnetic and gravitational interactions of

It leads from our theory that the electromagnetic (Eel) and gravitational
(EG) potentials of uncompensated sub-elementary particle, derived in Uniﬁed
model (UM), are dependent on the longitudinal and transverse translational vi-

8.1 Neutrino and Antineutrino in Uniﬁed Model

We put forward a conjecture, that the quantized energy of neutrino and antineu-
trino of three lepton generation, as a stable Bivacuum symmetry excitation, are
related to the rest mass of corresponding generations of the electron and positron
(±me,µ,τ

/MP l)2 is a gravitational ﬁne structure constants,

From (8.4a and 8.4b) one may see, that if our model is correct, the neu-
trino/antineutrino directly participate in gravitational interaction/repulsion.
The energy of such interaction should be dependent on density energy of
neutrino and its generation.
In accordance to UM, heavy µ and τ neu-
trino are related to gravitational radiation of nuclears, as far the quarks are
formed by superposition of corresponding electrons generation (section 2.4),
and e− neutrino, to that of the e−electrons.

8.2 Virtual Photons Radiation by the Electrons and
Positrons, as a result of their [C ⇋ W ] pulsation

The virtual electromagnetic photons are emitted and absorbed in a course of
[C ⇋ W ] pulsation of sub-elementary particle in accordance with known mech-
anism of the electric and magnetic dipole radiation, induced by charges acceler-
ation, accompanied the pulsation.

The time-averaged actual photons radiation intensity of the charged elemen-
tary particles is determined by particles external kinetic energy, related to their
longitudinal vibrations, i.e. by velocity of electric current and it alternation in
time. This result of our UM is in total accordance with conventional radiation
theory and experiment.

For the case of actual photons, propagating in space with light velocity, the
electric and magnetic dipole radiation intensity of uncompensated pair of sub-
elementary particles are equal. The intensity of EM radiation in Bivacuum is
deﬁned by the Pointing vector: εEM = c

4π [EH].

The total electromagnetic energy of the electron (Eel) can be considered as
a part of total energy of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC), determined by the ﬁne
structure constant (α = e2/~c) as a factor. This means that the notion of the
electric and magnetic components of virtual quanta, responsible for interaction

between charged particles, looks to be pertinent for the wave [W] phase of
particle only. However, the electric and magnetic components of charge are
related to [actual vortex + complementary rotor] dipole of corpuscular [C] phase,
correspondingly.

The notions of spin, actual mass and time also are pertinent only for [C]

phase of particle only.

sible for electric and magnetic components of the resulting electro-
magnetic potential, respectively.

of the electron [2F −

particle.

The coherent [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of uncompensated sub-elementary

In accordance to our model, the electromagnetic repulsion and attraction
between two charged particles is a result of tendency of system to minimize
the resulting density of energy of their cumulative virtual clouds (CV C± +

l i ⇐⇒ [F±

The repulsion is a consequence of the excessive uncompensated virtual

spect to outside virtual pressure. Consequently:

9 Links Between the Maxwell’s Theory of Elec-

tromagnetic Field and Uniﬁed Model

9.1 The Maxwell’s Classical Description

The force lines of the permanent electric ﬁeld have always the starting point
and the ending point on diﬀerent charges. It means localization of the electrical
charges in space. In contrast to electric ﬁeld, the permanent magnetic ﬁeld lines
have not the points of the start and that of the end. The corresponding vectorial
ﬁeld, formed by continuous force lines is termed a whirl ﬁeld.

The notion of an electric ﬁeld is related to electric charges, localized in space.
When charges begin to move, the magnetic ﬁeld originates. Notwithstanding a
big eﬀorts, the magnetic monopoles (positive and negative like charge of positron
and electron) was not experimentally found. It looks, that the spatial charge
dynamics, like vortex and rotor, representing the collective excitations of sub-
quantum particles, could be a source of magnetic poles, as postulated in our
model.

The symmetry and diﬀerence between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds is

expressed by four Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetic ﬁeld.

The expressions, interrelating the electric (E) and magnetic (H) ﬁelds ten-
sion with scalar potential of electric ﬁeld (φ = −Er) and vector potential of
magnetic ﬁeld (A= 1
2 [Hr]) are (Landau and Lifshitz, 1988):

Maxwell equation:

(9.2)

Taking the divergence of the both parts of (9.1a), keeping in mind that the

divergence of the rotor is equal to zero, we get the 2nd Maxwell equation:

div H = 0

In the integral form the eqs. 9.2 and 9.2a may be presented as:

E dl = −

This means that the electromotive force in some contour (left part) is equal
to the negative time derivative of magnetic ﬂux throw the surface, bordered by
this contour.

The second pair of the Maxwell eqs. can be derived from the principle of

least action (Landau, Lifshitz, 1988):

div E = 4πρ

It means that the circulation of magnetic ﬁeld along some contour is equal
to sum of currents: the conducting (j) and the displacement current
,
propagating throw the surface, limited by this contour. The displacement mass-

less current is responsible for for excitation of magnetic ﬁeld in vacuum, when
j = 0.

In this form, pertinent for electromagnetic waves in vacuum, the symmetry
between the magnetic and electric (9.2) components of EM ﬁeld is evident.

Let us evaluate the electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld density and ﬂux of
energy. After multiplying the (eq.9.3a) on E and (eq.9.2) on H and adding
them to each other, we get:

The principal diﬀerence between the electric and magnetic component of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld follows also from analysis of the Lorentz force, acting on
moving charge:

F = FE + FH = qE + q[vH]

(9.9)

where (q) is an elementary charge moving in the electromagnetic ﬁeld; E -
electric ﬁeld tension; H - the magnetic ﬁeld tension; −→v is the charge velocity
with respect to magnetic ﬁeld.

The magnetic component of Lorentz force (FH ) forms a right angle with the
vector of charge velocity (v) and, consequently, does no work. It changes the
direction of charge movement only, without changing its kinetic energy. The
energy of charged particle changes under the action of the electric component
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld alone. This corresponds to the electric contribution
(qE) of Lorentz force (9.9) doing work.

9.2 The Dependence of Vector and Scalar Potentials on

the Charge Velocity

The Lienor-Vihert vector potentials, produced by the moving elementary charge
with external group velocity (−→v ) (Landau and Lifshitz, 1988) looks as:

(9.11)

It follows from (9.10 and 9.11), that both potentials tend to inﬁnity at ve-
locity of charge tending to the light one (v → c). This consequence of electrody-
namics is in total accordance with dependence of our electromagnetic potential
(8.10) of charged particle on the external group velocity and its kinetic energy.

9.3 The Link Between the Maxwell’s Formalism and Uni-

ﬁed Model

Using (8.1), the quantization rule for electromagnetic charge energy can be
expressed as:

where: m+
From this formula one can see that the electromagnetic energy is a result of
quantum beats with frequency (ωC⇋W ) between the actual and complementary
corpuscular states of sub-quantum particles and antiparticles of the fermions.
Such a pulsation represent the reversible jumps from corpuscular [C] phase to
the wave [W] phase and back with emission ⇋ absorption of cumulative virtual
cloud (CVC±).

We may consider the states of actual vortex and complementary rotor of [C]

The collective excitations of sub-quantum particles in form of charged ro-

the opposite charges: actual and complementary.
In condition of primordial
Bivacuum of the ideal symmetry these charges totally compensate each other.
In accordance to our Uniﬁed model, the conducting current can be subdi-

vided to three contributions - one rotational and two translational:

j = jrot + jktr + j⊥tr

The main contribution to conducting current, pertinent for [C] phase of
asymmetric Bivacuum sub-elementary fermions only, is a consequence of dif-

10 Possible Role of Golden Mean in the Prop-

erties of Atoms

10.1 New Interpretation of Compton eﬀect

Analyzing the experimental scattering of X-rays on the carbon atoms of paraﬃn
and graphite target, formed by the carbon atoms only, Compton found that the
X-rays wave length increasing (∆λ = λ − λ0) after scattering on the electrons of
carbon has the following dependence on the scattering angle (ϑ − angle between
the incident and scattered beam):

∆λ = 2

sin2 ϑ = 2λC sin2 ϑ

(10.1)

h
m0c

Compton got this formula from the laws of momentum and energy conser-
vation of the system [X-photon + electron in atom] before and after scattering,
in form:

~k = ~k′ + mv (the wave numbers : k = ω/c and k = ω′/c

(10.2)

~ω + m0c2 = ~ω

′

+ mc2 m = m0/[1 − (v/c)2]1/2

(10.2a)

However, Compton made a strong assumption, that the electron before en-
ergy/momentum exchange with X-photon is in rest, i.e. his group velocity is
zero: v = 0.

We propose the new interpretation of the Compton experiments, assuming
that only translational group velocity of the electron is close to zero: vtr = 0,
but it is not true for rotational velocity. Such approach do not aﬀect the ﬁnal
relation (10.3), if we suppose, that the rotational dynamics (spinning) of the
electrons follows Golden mean.

At the conditions of Golden mean, providing by fast spinning of sub-
elementary particles of triplets <[F −

(10.6)

Scattering of photon on the electron or proton, change their momentum
and kinetic energy related to translations only, not aﬀecting the parameters of
spinning.

New interpretation of the experimental data, obtained by Compton in 1923,
conﬁrms the consequence of our UM, that the mass and spin of elementary
particles are interrelated parameters, provided by Bivacuum dipoles symmetry
shift (∆mV c2 = β∆mC c2 → βm0 c2).

A self-stabilization and self-organization of matter occur under the inﬂuence
of Harmonization force of Bivacuum, driving the systems on all hierarchical

Excluding the velocity (v) from eqs. 10.7 and 10.8, we get the quantized

radius of the hydrogen orbit:

For the 1st stationary orbit (n = 1), assuming that the mass of the electron
is equal to its rest mass (m = m0), formula (10.9) turns to the Bohr orbit (aB) :

We can see from (10.13 and 10.14b), that the energy of electromagnetic
contribution to the total energy of free electron in [W] phase in GM conditions
(see 8.4) is directly related to its translational zero-point oscillation in [C] phase:

responsible for its electromagnetic potential at Golden mean (GM) conditions
as well, as for deviation of the electron’s magnetic moment (µe) from the Bohr’s
magneton (µB).

The curvature, characterizing the electromagnetic (EM) contribution to the

total energy of the free electron is less, than the Bohr radius (10.10):

Let us consider now the Hydrogen atom

We note here once more, that in accordance to our Uniﬁed model, just the
GM kinetic energy of elementary particles gyration - spinning, provided by Har-
monization force of Bivacuum action, - stands for such invariants, as the rest
mass and spin. The translational zero-point oscillations and corresponding con-
tribution to kinetic energy of the electron are related to its permanent external
electromagnetic potential.

One of conditions of its stability is the equality of the electron’s and proton’s
electromagnetic potentials. This means that the kinetic energy of the proton
in H-atom, determined by its zero-point oscillations, should be the same as that
of electron. For such a case we have the electromagnetic balance equation of

interaction between them in hydrogen atom. So, the EM interaction in H-atom
is switched on and oﬀ, accompanied by pulsation of the eﬀective dimensions of
the electron (L0 ⇋ Lel
[W ]) in a course their correlated in-phase or anti-phase
[C ⇋ W ] pulsation.

As far, the charge density is oscillating as a consequence of [W ⇋ C] pul-
sations of the spinning electron and its rotation around nuclear, the interpreta-
tion of dispersive Van-der-Waals interaction, as a result of coherently ﬂickering
charge of atoms/molecules, remains valid in our model.

In complex neutral atoms, containing the same number of the electrons and
protons, the [C ⇋ W ] cycles of each selected [electron + proton] pair - are
accompanied by corresponding quantized 3D standing waves formation.

Standing waves, formed by pairs of electrons with opposite spins and counter
phase [C ⇋ W ] pulsation, are more symmetric and stable, than in atoms with
unpaired electrons.

Uniﬁcation of atoms in a diﬀerent chemical reactions, resulting from uni-
ﬁcation of unpaired electrons and creation of additional symmetrical standing
waves B, is energetically favorable. Molecules could be considered as a highly
orchestrated dynamic systems, where the [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of all electrons
are coherent and occur with Golden mean frequency:

and stability of [electron-electron] and [electron-proton] pairs.

11.1 Possible Mechanism of Gravitational Interaction in

UM

It can be similar to hydrodynamic Bjorkness interaction between pulsing par-
ticles in liquids, radiating acoustic waves. However, in gravitation the role
of acoustic waves fulﬁll the virtual pressure waves in positive and negative
realms of Bivacuum (VPW+ and VPW−), emitted ⇋ absorbed in a course
of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of pairs of sub-elementary particles:

ementary fermions and bosons. The energy of gravitation is determined by
small asymmetry of density energy of VPW+ and VPW−:

wave length. If the length of acoustic (gravitational) waves, excited by pulsing
bodies, is less than the distance between bodies, the Bjorkness (gravitational)
force is attractive. If the distance is much bigger than wave length, then the
attraction turns to repulsion. This eﬀect means antigravitation.

The large-scale honey-comb structure of the Universe, its huge voids, could
be explained by the interplay of gravitational attraction and repulsion between
clusters of galactics, depending on the distance between them.

Recently a strong experimental evidence appears, pointing to acceleration
of the Universe expansion. This phenomena could be explained by increasing
the antigravitation factor with increasing the distance between galactics.
It
conﬁrms our hydrodynamic model of mechanism of gravitation.

Einstein postulates (1965), that gravitation changes the trajectory of probe
body from the straight-line to geodesic one due to curving of conventional two-
dimensional surface. The Lobachevskian geometry on curved surface was used
in Einstein’s classic theory of gravitation. The criteria of surface curvature of
sphere is a curvature radius (R), deﬁned as:

R = ±

S
Σ − π

r

(11.2)

where S is a square of triangle on the ﬂat surface; R is a sphere radius; Σ

is a sum of angles in triangle.

The sum of angles in triangle (Σ) on the ﬂat surface is equal to π = 1800 and
curvature R = ∞. For the other hand, on curved surface of radius (0 < R < ∞),
the sum of angles is

Σ = π + S/R2 > π

(11.2a)

When (Σ − π) > 0, the curvature (R > 0) is positive; when (Σ − π) < 0, the

curvature is imaginary (iR).

In our Gravitation theory instead space-time curvature [±R], we introduce
Bivacuum Symmetry Curvature (±LCur). It is deﬁned, as a radius of sphere of
virtual Bose condensation (VirBC), equal to that of domain of nonlocality in
secondary Bivacuum, generated by gravitating particle with mass (m+

C ):

(cid:12)
is a Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift, positive for particles and negative for
(cid:12)
antiparticles, related directly to mass symmetry shift (∆mC = m+

C − m−

C ).

(cid:12)

(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

In primordial Bivacuum, in the absence of matter, where: ∆mV = β∆mC =

0, the space is ﬂat, as far LCur = ∞.

From (11.3) the vacuum curvature, induced by particle with mass, equal
to that of the electron at Golden mean (GM) condition (∆mC = m0 = me =
Cur = 3.2288·1035m. For proton at GM condition (∆mC =
9.1095·10−31kg) is: Le
mP = 1.6726 · 10−27kg) we have: LP

Cur = 5.212 · 1025m.

The analogy between R and LCur (11.2 and 11.3) is obvious. The more is
energy of gravitational ﬁeld ǫG, and actual inertial mass, generating this ﬁeld
(m+
C ), the more is vacuum symmetry shift (∆mV ) and Bivacuum curvature. The
bigger is Bivacuum curvature (R or LCur), i.e. the more ﬂat is the Universe
the less is Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift |±∆mV | and corresponding actual
mass.

81

In accordance to our Uniﬁed model, the primary criteria of inertial mass is
a Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift and corresponding curvature of Bivacuum
(LCur).

In our Uniﬁed model the matter and antimatter induce the opposite Bivac-
uum dipoles symmetry shift. It means that antigravitation should exist between
matter and antimatter.

It follows from Bivacuum model, that the spin equilibrium shift between Bi-
vacuum fermions [BVF ↑ ⇋ BVF ↓] with properties of virtual electric and mag-
netic dipoles, is dependent on external electric and magnetic ﬁelds. For the
other hand, the shift of this equilibrium inﬂuence Bivacuum dipoles symmetry

Brown (charged condensers), Searl’s eﬀects, N-machine of de Palma and Bau-
rov’s device, related to dynamic Stavros experiments.

The photons trajectory reﬂects the Bivacuum curvature in 3D space. It is a
consequence of our model of photon, as a superposition of three pairs of coherent
pair [F + ⊲⊳ F −], moving in Bivacuum without its symmetry perturbation.

11.2 The Red Shift of Photons in UM

As well, as General theory of relativity, UM can explain the red shift of photons
in gravitational ﬁeld. The RED, low-frequency shift:

∆ω1,2

p = ω(1)

p − ω(2)
p

(11.6)

of photons in gravitation ﬁeld is a result of deviation of their trajectory from the
right line and is a consequence of increasing the vacuum symmetry curvature
and corresponding length of its path.

In accordance to our model, red shift has a simple relation to diﬀer-

We may conclude, that our Uniﬁed model of Gravitation explains the same
phenomena, as do the General theory of relativity, but in terms of vacuum
symmetry shift instead of curved space-time. The tensor properties of Bivacuum
dipoles symmetry shift is related directly to that of mass symmetry shift:

11.3 Uniﬁcation of Time, Space, Electromagnetism and

Gravitation in UM

As a consequence of our Uniﬁed model (see eqs. 7.5; 8.1 and 8.2), we got for
any closed system a simple, symmetric and very important formula of
UNIFICATION of pace of time [d ln t = dt/t] (temporal ﬁeld), determined by
relative change of kinetic energy of system (d ln Tk = dTk/Tk), with changes of
its electromagnetic and gravitational potential (dEel/dt = dEG/dt), mass and
spatial parameter - de Broglie wave length (λ = h/m+

Cv).
For private case of isolated charged particle we have:

d ln t = −d ln Tk = d ln m+

C + 2d ln λ = −d ln Eel = −d ln EG

(11.11)

where the kinetic energy: Tk = h2/(2m+

C λ2).
This Uniﬁcation Formula means that the coherent alternating kinetic energy
of any closed system: internal, related to [C ⇋ W ] pulsation and external, such
as thermal oscillations of atoms/molecules, acceleration of macroscopic bodies -
determines its pace of time, change of mass, spatial parameters, electromagnetic
and gravitational radiation.

It follows from our approach, that time, like electromagnetic and gravita-
tional ﬁelds, has a tensor properties, i.e.
it may be spatially anisotropic. The
non scalar properties of these ﬁelds are related with anisotropy of Bivacuum
dipoles symmetry shift:

11.4 The new compensation principle of Bivacuum sym-

metry shifts, induced by matter and ﬁelds

The law of energy conservation keeps the total energy of [secondary Bivacuum
+ energy of sub-elementary particles] unchanged and equal to zero, like in pri-

83

mordial Bivacuum (see Chapter 2).

The new compensation principle of Bivacuum symmetry shifts, induced by

where: N is a ﬁnite number of elementary particles in closed system under

k = ∞ is the inﬁnitive number of asymmetric Bivacuum fermions or an-
tifermions, uncompensated, due to dynamic equilibrium (BV F ↑ ⇋ BV F ↓)i
shift under the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds, generated by dynamics of charged
elementary particles.

This compensation principle propose a new interpretation of potential ﬁelds.
The basic - spin or torsion ﬁeld, generating charge, mass of particles and their
[C⇋ W ] pulsation, and its derivatives: electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds.
They are the consequence of Bivacuum fermions and antifermions dynamic equi-
librium (BV F ↑ ⇋ BV F ↓)i shift, compensating the [C⇋ W ] pulsation, longitu-
dinal and transverse translational vibrations of uncompensated sub-elementary
particles.

The corresponding equilibrium shifts occurs, as a result of interaction of
equal, but opposite magnetic moments of BV F ↑ and BV F ↓ (see section 2.2)
with magnetic ﬁelds, generated by corresponding three types of charge dynam-
ics, modulated by [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of sub-elementary particles. The longi-
tudinal (z) and transverse (x) translational vibrations occur in direction normal
to each other and vector of the particle external group velocity and vector of
its uncompensated cumulative virtual cloud (y). The axe (x) coincides with

These hierarchy of dynamics of charged particles is a background of corre-
sponding hierarchy of magnetic ﬁelds tension [HS,E,G], in accordance to the ﬁrst
Maxwell equation (11.23).

These kind of ﬁelds exist in form of diﬀerent kinds of modulation (hierarchy

of modulation) of the resulting constant of [BVF↑ ⇋BVF↓]S,E,G equilibrium:

K Re s

(BV F ↑⇋BV F ↓)i = KS(BV F ↑⇋BV F ↓)iKE(BV F ↑⇋BV F ↓)i KG(BV F ↑⇋BV F ↓)i

where : KS(BV F ↑⇋BV F ↓)i > KE(BV F ↑⇋BV F ↓)i >> KG(BV F ↑⇋BV F ↓)i

The frequency of quantum beats, determined by three contributions of ele-
mentary fermions dynamics to diﬀerence between the actual and complementary
states, represent the hierarchy of Golden mean frequency modulation:

ω0 = m0c2/~ = ωφ
S
ωE = αω0
ωG = βω0

where : ω0/ωE ˜ 137 and ω0/ωG ˜ 1045

(11.29)

(11.30)
(11.30a)

(11.30b)

(11.30c)

Consequently, the electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds may be deﬁned
also, as two hierarchic levels of elementary particles [C⇋ W ] pulsation carrying
frequency (ω0 = ωC⇋W ) modulation (see 11.26 - 11.28). The electromagnetic
ﬁeld modulation frequency (ωE = αω0) and gravitational ﬁeld modulation fre-
quency (ωG = βω0) are, in fact the consequence of corresponding magnetic
ﬁelds, generated by longitudinal and transversal vibrations of the charged ele-
mentary particles. In accordance to our compensation principle, these magnetic
ﬁelds induce the nonlocal [BVF↑ ⇋BVF↓]E,G dynamic equilibrium shift, oppo-
site to that, generated by elementary particles dynamics themselves.

The new compensation principle of Bivacuum energy symmetry
shifts, induced by matter and ﬁelds (11.13-11.13b), is a consequence
of Bivacuum energy conservation.
It can be formulated as follows: the local
Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift, dependent on kinetic energy of particles and
nonlocal resulting symmetry shift, generated by potential ﬁelds of these particles,
- are opposite and equal to each other.

12 The mechanism of quantum entanglement

between coherent particles

In accordance to our UM, the nonlocal
interaction (quantum entanglement)
between particles with coherent [C ⇋ W ] pulsation is realized via Bivacuum
symmetry oscillation (BvSO), modulated the exchange interaction between vir-
tual pressure waves (VPW±) of Bivacuum and symmetric pairs [F−

elementary particles h[F−

of pairs. Experimentally, the quantum entanglement was revealed ﬁrstly by
Aspect, et al., (1982; 1983).

Such a process is mediated by nonlocal BvSO in the volume of virtual Bose

condensate (VirBC), formed by BVF l and BVB ± (see section 1).

The BvSO are the consequence of diﬀerent Bivacuum symmetry shifts, in-
duced by [C] and [W] phase of uncompensated sub-elementary particles. Their
values are correspondingly:

The eﬀectiveness of nonlocal interaction between two or more separated
elementary particles is dependent on synchronization of [C ⇋ W ] pulsations,
and correlation of polarization of (VPW±)x,y,z of Bivacuum in the system of
interacting particles. It is easy to see from (10.5 and 10.6), that the bigger is
Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift (∆∆mC⇋W
), induced by sender (S) and the
more coherent are C ⇋ W pulsation of (S) and receiver (R), the less is frequency
deviation ∆ω = ωR − ωS
and the more eﬀective is quantum entanglement
between particles.

Spatial stability of complex systems: atoms, molecules and that of solids
means that in these systems superposition of CVC, representing [W] states of

forms hologram - like 3D standing virtual waves superposition with location of
i
nodes in the most probable positions of corpuscular phase of the nucleons, elec-
trons, atoms and molecules in condensed matter. The binding of CVC by BVFl
restore the [C] phase of particles in positions, close to the most probable ones.
So, the coherent atoms/molecules thermal oscillation in composition of clus-
ters, representing mesoscopic Bose condensate (Kaivarainen, 2001b,c), should
be strictly correlated with coherent [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of their elementary
particles.

The opposite statement also is correct. The [C ⇋ W ] decoherence and
spatial disorientation (depolarization) of elementary particles of atoms and
molecules in condensed matter, induced, for example by external ﬁelds or laser
beam, may have a feedback reaction with their random thermal ﬂuctuations.

The mechanism, proposed, may explain the theoretical (Einstein, et all.
1935; Cramer, 2001) and experimental evidence in proof of nonlocal interaction
between coherent elementary particles (Aspect, et all. 1982; 1983) and atoms.
Our theory predicts, that the same mechanism may provide the distant quan-
tum entanglement between mesoscopic and macroscopic systems, including bio-
logical ones, if [ C ⇋ W ] pulsations of their particles are ’tuned’ to each other
and they have close spatial polarization and symmetry. (Kaivarainen, 2001d).

Besides the problems, discussed in this paper, the Uniﬁed Model provides a
deeper understanding of Pauli and Heizenberg principles. It was shown, using
the Virial theorem, that condition of Bose condensation (BC) - actual in matter
or virtual in Bivacuum - coincide with condition of nonlocality, as independence
of potential on distance. Generalized principle of Le Chatelier, as a resistance
of Bivacuum symmetry shift and [C ⇋ W ] pulsation frequency of particles to
their acceleration (Kaivarainen, 2000, 2001), has been applied for explanation
of inertia.

12.1 Explanation of Two-Slit Experiment in UM

Bohm, like Einstein, rejected the Bohr’s statement, that particles can not be
considered until they are observed. In his last book, written with Basil Hiley:
”THE UNDIVIDED UNIVERSE. An ontological interpretation of quantum the-
ory” (1993), the electron is considered as a particle with well- deﬁned position
and momentum which are, however, under inﬂuence of special wave (quantum
potential). Particle in accordance with this authors is a sequence of incoming
and outgoing waves, which are very close to each other. However, particle itself
does not have a wave nature after Bohm. Interference pattern in double slit
experiment is a result of periodically ”bunched” character of quantum potential
in Bohm’s view.

In accordance to our model, the electron is a triplet h[F−

↓ ] + F−
↓ i
formed by two negatively charged sub-elementary fermions of opposite spins
(F−

section 1.1).The symmetric pair of standing sub-elementary particle and an-

in-phase, compensating the inﬂuence of energy, spin and charge of each other.
The bunched character of the electron’s trajectory can be a result of its peri-
odic momentum oscillation, produced by [C ⇋ W] pulsation of uncompensated
sub-elementary particle (F−

It leads from our model, that the energy and momentum of the electron

In accordance to our model, the reversible [C ⇋ W] pulsations are accom-
panied by outgoing and incoming Cumulative Virtual Cloud (CVC), composed
from sub-quantum particles (see section 2.2).

Another factor of bunched trajectory is the interaction of pair

↑ ⊲⊳ F+
F−
of the electron with nonlocal Bivacuum gap oscillation (BvO), generated by
i
[C ⇋ W] oscillation of other particles of medium at certain quantum boundary
conditions. The mechanism of such eﬀect, leading from our model, is that the
actual kinetic energy of elementary particles (electron, photon,etc.) and their
actual momentum, which are determined by uncompensated sub-elementary
due
particles, change in similar way, as the same parameters of pair
to symmetry of triplet properties conservation. This means that properties of
(F−

the properties of symmetric pair.

We can see, that our model do not needs the Bohmian ”quantum potential”
or ”pilot wave” for explanation of two-slit experiment. For the general case of
ensembles of particles, the explanation can be related to interference of their
[W] phase in form of cumulative virtual clouds (CVC) with most probable wave
length, determined by the most probable actual momentum of particles in a

93

beam. For other hand, the ability of symmetric pair of sub-elementary fermions
[F − ⊲⊳ F +] in composition of elementary particle to activate nonlocal Bivacuum
gap oscillation (BvO) as well as similar pairs in any target, due to their [C ⇋ W ]
pulsation may be responsible for interference of BvO, even in the case of single
electron or photon.

Scattering of photons on free electrons will aﬀect their momentum, mass,
wave B length and, consequently, the interference picture. Only [C] phase of
particle, but not its [W] phase can be registered by detectors of particles. Such a
consequences of our dynamic duality model can explain all details of well known
and still mysterious double slit experiment.

The interference between VPW+ and VPW−, generated by sub-elementary
particles of the diﬀerent electrons of beam with VPW±, excited by electrons of
screen, also can contribute to results of two-slit experiment.

13 Free energy machines: the Searl’s Magneto-

Gravitational Convertor

13.1 The Source of Free Energy of Bivacuum

In accordance to our Uniﬁed model, the Coulomb and gravitational potentials
of elementary particles are determined by the diﬀerence of the actual and com-
plementary masses (mass symmetry shift ∆mC ) in [C] phase and corresponding
Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift in [W] phase of sub-elementary particles.

The energy exchange between the positive and negative energetic compart-
ments of the asymmetric double cells-dipoles (sub-elementary particles) occur in
form of quantum beats between the actual (m+
C c2)
states of the corpuscular [C] phase of sub-elementary particle or antiparticle.
These beats are accompanied by the [emission ⇋ absorption] of cumulative
virtual cloud (CVC) of sub-quantum particles, representing the [W] phase of
sub-elementary particle. This is a way of [C ⇋ W ] duality realization in our
Uniﬁed model (UM).

C c2) and complementary (m−

In the additional permanent gravitational (EG), electric (EEl) or magnetic
ﬁelds, the additional Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift occur, as compared to
that, pertinent for unperturbed space.

Consequently the local Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift, induced artiﬁcially
by strong permanent magnets, electric condensers and rotation of matter, could
be used via [C ⇋ W ] duality of the electrons, quarks to convert this additional
symmetry shift to diﬀerent form of energy, like electromagnetic and gravitational
ones.

The source of ’free energy’, consequently, is the additional shift of Bivacuum

fermions and antifermions equilibrium in the some selected area of space:

S=1/2(−→µ +) ⇋ BV F ↓

S=−1/2(−→µ −)

(13.1a)

In accordance to the resulting Bivacuum symmetry conservation principle
(11.17), introduced in our work, this local additional equilibrium shift, i.e. in-
duced by artiﬁcial permanent gravitational, magnetic or electric ﬁelds, should
be compensated by the opposite equilibrium shift in the other parts of space.

The Searl eﬀect, conﬁrmed recently in experiments of Roshin and Godin
(2000), displays itself in decreasing or increasing weight of rotating permanent
magnets, depending on direction of their rotation as respect to Earth gravity
vector: clockwise or anticlockwise and self-acceleration of rotation after over-
coming of certain speed threshold. The latter eﬀect was explained already in
Section 5, as a result of pull-in range and combinational resonance of [C ⇋ W ]
pulsation of particles of rotating body with Harmonization force (HaF) of Bi-
vacuum.

The setup (convertor) of Roshin and Godin is comprised by immobile stator
and rotor, carrying magnetic rollers and moving around the stator. The diam-
eter of rotor is about 1 m. The stator (weight 110 kg) and magnetic rollers
(total weight 115 kg) were manufactured from separate magnetized segments
with residual magnetization of 0.85 T, a coercive force of [Hc] ˜600 kA/m and a
speciﬁc magnetic energy of [W] ˜150 J/m3. The stator and rotor were assembled
on a single platform made of nonmagnetic material.

13.2 The Mechanism of Self-Acceleration in Searl Eﬀect

The resonant energy exchange between Bivacuum and interrelated elements of
nonlinear systems with many degrees of freedom, i.e. between nuclears and elec-
trons, atoms and molecules of condensed matter, may occur under the inﬂu-
ence of Harmonization Force (HaF) of Bivacuum (see Section 5). The energy
exchange between diﬀerent degrees of freedom of matter with Bivacuum at con-
ditions of combinational resonance may induce ﬁnally even self-acceleration
of macroscopic body of rotation.

Such dynamic Bivacuum - Matter interaction may explain the Searl eﬀect,
conﬁrmed by Baurov and Ogarkov (1994), Roshin and Godin (2000).
It oc-
cur, if the amplitude of virtual pressure waves (VPW±) and asymmetry of
V Pr+ −V Pr−
virtual pressure of positive and negative vacuum: ∆V Pr± =
(Kaivarainen, 2001d), overcome certain threshold. Corresponding conditions in
(cid:12)
the autooscillating nonlinear systems may result from ampliﬁcation of VPW±,
(cid:12)
frequency and uncompensated virtual density energy of Bivacuum by magnetic
ﬁeld, generated by magnetized solid of revolution.

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Self-acceleration starts, if the pull-in range becomes suﬃciently wide for
synchronization of external and internal frequencies after overcoming certain
speed of body rotation. This is accompanied by enhancement of degree of

95

its particles [C ⇋ W ] pulsation coherency and improving the conditions for
combinational resonance of matter with HaF of Bivacuum.

Our calculations show, that for magneto-gravitational convertor, with diam-
eter of about 1m and critical rotor speed of 550 rpm, the corresponding collective
linear velocity of particles, composing surface of magnetic rollers, is about 5·103
cm/s. This value is pretty close to the most probable velocity of molecules,
related to their thermal translational vibrations, simulated for ice at -100 0C
(Kaivarainen, 1995; 2001). The average velocity of atoms of rotating magnets
may have the same order.

In accordance to our theory of wave-particle duality (see eqs. 3.2; 3.2a), the
equal kinetic energy of similar particles corresponds to equal frequency of their
[C ⇋ W ] pulsation (ωC⇋W ).

Out of pull-in range of stable generation, the quantum beats between the
fundamental modes of Bivacuum and modes of particles of condensed matter
oscillation should take a place. These beats may display themselves in form
of electromagnetic (radiated by matter) and VPW± waves with corresponding
frequency.

13.3 The Variation of Weight of Rotating Magnets

This eﬀect, starting before self-acceleration, can be explained in the framework
of UM by the inﬂuence of curled magnetic ﬁeld on dynamic equilibrium of
Bivacuum fermions with opposite spins and magnetic moments (eqs. 1.6 and
2.4 and 13.1b).

The resulting constant of this equilibrium [K res

BV F ↑⇋BV F ↓ (r)] we in-
troduce as a product of equilibrium constant, determined by gravita-
tion [K G
and that, determined by magnetic ﬁeld inﬂuence
[K H
BV F ↑⇋BV F ↓ (r)]. The resulting constant deﬁne the resulting Bivacuum
dipoles symmetry shift and value and direction of resulting gravitational poten-
G ), which may coincide or be opposite with the Earth gravity vector:

The shift of dynamic equilibrium (13.1) and corresponding Bivacuum sym-
metry, induced by rotating magnetic ﬁeld, in accordance to our model, should
be accompanied by corresponding mass (∆mC = m+
C ) and charge (∆e± =
e+ − e−) symmetry shift of Bivacuum double cells-dipoles (eq. 4.2b), followed
by activation of their external movement with group velocity (v > 0).

At this condition the actual charge of asymmetric Bivacuum fermions be-
comes bigger, than the complementary one: e+ > e− and the diﬀerence between
them ∆e± = e+ − e− determines the induced by rotating magnetic ﬁeld uncom-
pensated charge of BVF.

The motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic ﬁeld turns their

trajectory under the inﬂuence of Lorentz force:

In the absence of electric ﬁeld E = 0, the Lorentz force is:

where α is the angle between vectors (v) and (F).
The module of Lorentz force |F | at E = 0 is maximum at α = 900 and is

equal to zero at α = 00.

As far the Lorentz force is normal to vectors v and H and do not produce a
work, but only change the trajectory of charged particle to screw curvature. This
curvature is a result of superposition of movement with velocity (vk), parallel
to H and uniform rotational movement in direction normal to H with velocity
(v⊥).

The Lorentz force, acting on asymmetric Bivacuum fermions with uncom-
pensated charge ∆e± = |e+| − |e−| , moving in magnetic ﬁeld (H) with velocity
(v) by screw curvature, is:

13.4 The Nature of Magnetic Shells Around the Conver-

tor

One more unusual eﬀect, discovered in work of Roshin and Godin (2000), is the
appearance of the vertical ’magnetic walls’ - zones of increased magnetic ﬁeld
strength, as compared to ﬁeld strength between them, arranged coaxially to the

98

rotor center. We explain this, as a result of ability of slowly moving under the
inﬂuence of curled magnetic ﬁeld the excessive Bivacuum fermions (BVF↑ or
BVF↓) to form the quantized virtual standing waves around rotating magnets.
To quantify our explanation, we proceed from the consequence of our model,
that the constant of resulting equilibrium between the actual and complemen-
tary states of BVFl, (K res

Corresponding external group velocity of asymmetric BVF, forming walls,

(cid:2)

calculated from (13.16) is about 50 cm, increasing from the center to periphery.
The thickness of magnetic walls was about 5-8 cm and their height more
than 500 cm. The lower temperature inside the walls, as compared to temper-
ature between them (i.e. the lower kinetic energy of the air molecules), may
be a result of increasing of potential energy of electromagnetic Van der Waals
interaction between the air molecules due to decreasing of Bivacuum electric
permeability (ε0) in the volume of magnetic walls. The (ε0) decreasing is a
consequence of virtual charge density increasing, deﬁned by enhanced density
of asymmetric Bivacuum fermions with uncompensated charge in the volume
of their standing waves around rotating magnets. The additional increasing of
the intermolecular interaction potential and decreasing of ionization potential
in magnetic walls could be a consequence of the air molecules polarizability el-
evation due to enhanced screening eﬀect of Coulomb interaction between the
electrons and protons of the air molecules by charged Bivacuum excitations
(asymmetric BVF). The spontaneous [ionization ⇋ recombination] of the air
molecules in magnetic walls, as a result of (ε0) decreasing, may explain the vis-
ible photons emission in the region around converter. It is important to note,

100

that in this case the ionization is not induced by collision of molecules or strong
external electric potential, like at corona discharge.

The development of technology, based on Searl eﬀect, could be used in future
for extraction of ’free energy’ of Bivacuum, utilizing its Harmonization force,
and for creation of new principles of space propulsion. Consequently, the Searl
eﬀect is a result of combination of two relatively independent mechanisms of
the convertor interaction with Bivacuum. The self-acceleration is provided by
harmonization force of Bivacuum in conditions of pull-in range, close to that
of combinational resonance. The weight of convertor decreasing/increasing is
a consequence of corresponding Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift, induced by
interaction of rotating magnetic ﬁeld with Bivacuum fermions and antifermions
of opposite magnetic moments and spins. This symmetry shift, in accordance
to our theory, is responsible for gravitational interaction.

The ability of our Uniﬁed Model to clarify the phenomena, like Searl eﬀect,

can be considered, as a criteria of model validity.

14 The Bearden Free Energy Collector

Good descriptions of the Tom Bearden (2000 - 2002) free energy collector, as a
part of motionless electromagnetic generator (MEG) action principle, has been
presented by Naudin (2001) and by Squires (2000).

The interesting attempt for theoretical background of extracting energy from
vacuum has been done in work of Myron Evans (2002), using Sachs theory of
electrodynamics (Sachs, 2002), unifying the gravitational and electromagnetic
ﬁelds. In this theory both ﬁelds are their own sources of energy: the equivalent to
mass and equivalent to 4-cuurrent, correspondingly. The electromagnetic ﬁeld
inﬂuence the gravitational ﬁeld and vice versa. The Sachs theory cannot be
reduced to the Maxwell-Heviside theory. The Evans (2002) comes to conclusion
that just because of existence of space-time curvature (always pertinent for our
secondary Bivacuum), any kind of dipole (like our sub-elementary particles Fl)
can be used for extracting of energy from space. The idea of dipole, as a free
energy transmitter, has been developed by Bearden (2000).

In accordance to our Uniﬁed model (UM), origination of the rest mass (mi
0),
is a result of Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift due to their spinning with angle
frequency, equal to that of Golden mean: ωi

0 = mi

0c2/~.

The energy of quantum beats between corresponding actual and complemen-

tary states is:

C − m−

E0 = ~ω0 = (m+

C )φc2 = m0c2 = (2Tk)φ
the source of free energy is the Bivacuum dipoles symmetry shift, induced
by their longitudinal and transverse vibrations, responsible, correspondingly for
electromagnetic and gravitational interaction (see Chapter 8):

resistance, as result of the [electrons + ion lattice] of the conductor or semicon-
ductor dynamics coherency increasing. This may happens under the Harmo-

condensation of the electrons of Cooper pairs and ions in form of coherent clus-
ters. The latter phenomena has been discussed in our Hierarchic theory of
superconductivity (Kaivarainen, 2000).

In MEG the activation of the [electrons+ions] of ’collector’ - degenerate
semi-conductor occur in short-living nonequilibrium states, induced by periodic
action of the ramp generator in combination with permanent magnetic ﬁeld ac-
tion. Such asymmetry of Bivacuum and nonequilibrium of matter is necessary
for MEG action with coeﬃcient of performance: COP>1 (Naudin, 2001; Bear-
den, 2002). The MEG works on the principle water-mill, using the gravitational
potential, related directly to Bivacuum asymmetry.

The COP is not the same as eﬃciency, which is always less, than 100%.
It means, that the ’free energy’ devices are not violating the law of energy
conservation and have nothing common with perpetual mobile.

15 Conclusion

Uniﬁed Model (UM) represents the next stage of our eﬀorts for uniﬁcation of
vacuum, matter and ﬁelds from few ground postulates. New concept of Bi-
vacuum is introduced, as a dynamic matrix of the Universe with superﬂuid
and nonlocal properties, composed from non mixing microscopic sub-quantum
particles of the opposite energies. The mesoscopic structure of Bivacuum is
presented by inﬁnitive number of three-dimensional (3D) double cells, each cell
containing a pair of correlated rotors and antirotors: (V +) and (V −) of the
opposite quantized energy, virtual mass, spin, charge and magnetic moments.

Bivacuum has a properties of the active medium with double cells, as the
active elements. In such a medium the Virtual Pressure Waves (VPW+ and
VPW−) can behave as the autowaves, able to diﬀerent kinds of self-organization
under the inﬂuence of Virtual replica (VR) of matter, including biological sys-
tems.

The matter in form of sub-elementary particles/antiparticles is a result
of Bivacuum cells symmetry shift towards the positive or negative energy,
correspondingly. Certain combinations of triplets of sub-elementary parti-
cles/antiparticles form elementary particles and antiparticles, like electrons,
positrons, photons and quarks. The [corpuscle (C) - wave (W)] duality is a
result of quantum beats between the ’actual’ and ’complementary’ states of
sub-elementary particles/antiparticles. The [C] phase represents mass, electric
and magnetic dipoles. The [W] phase exists in form of Cumulative virtual cloud
(CVC) of sub-quantum particles. The energy and momentum of [C] and [W]
phase are equal. The part of CVC energy, determined by ﬁne structure constant,
stands for virtual photons, responsible for interaction between charged particles
(i.e. electrons, positrons). They are result of dipole radiation, generated by
[C ⇋ W ] oscillation of uncompensated sub-elementary particles and antipar-
ticles if triplets. The Virtual Replica (VR) of matter is a result of nonlinear
interaction of VPW± of Bivacuum with those, generated by [C ⇋ W ] pulsation
of elementary particles, forming atoms and molecules of matter.

103

”Harmonization inﬂuence” of Bivacuum on matter properties is a result of
induced resonance between virtual pressure waves (VPW±) of positive and neg-
ative vacuum and [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of symmetric pairs of sub-elementary
particles and antiparticles, forming electrons, positrons, quarks, etc. The fun-
damental Harmonization frequencies of VPW± are deﬁned by the rest mass of
the electrons of three electron generation: ωe,µ,τ
c2/~, as postulated
in UM. For the other hand, it is shown in our work, that the energy of sub-
elementary particles, deﬁned by the rest mass of the electrons of three generation
(EC = EW = m0c2 = ~ω0)e,µ,τ , correspond to Golden mean conditions, when
the ratio of external group velocity to the light one is:

= φ = 0.618.

= me,µ,τ
0

It is demonstrated also, that realization of principle of Least action can be
a result of Bivacuum Harmonization force action on particles dynamics. It is
shown, that the pace of time for any closed system is determined by pace of
kinetic energy change of this system, i.e. by change of its mass and spatial
characteristics in accordance to special theory of relativity. The time oscillation
(temporal ﬁeld) is related in elegant symmetrical way to oscillation of electro-
magnetic and gravitational ﬁelds.

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

It is useful to summarize the properties of symmetric primordial Bivacuum
and asymmetric secondary Bivacuum, existing in presence of matter and ﬁelds.
The primordial Bivacuum is formed by symmetric double cells dipoles, each
pole representing the Compton radius vortex . The external group velocity of
Bivacuum dipoles is zero, making possible their inﬁnitive virtual Bose condensa-
tion, providing nonlocal properties of Bivacuum. The internal group and phase
velocity of sub-quantum particles and sub-quantum antiparticles, composing
each dipole, are equal to light velocity. The diﬀerence between the actual (m+
C )
and complementary (m−
C ) mass is zero, consequently the frequency of quantum
beats between corresponding states also is zero.

The diﬀerence between the actual and complementary charge and between
corresponding magnetic moments of symmetric Bivacuum dipoles are also zero.
As a consequence, no rest mass, no electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds
exists in primordial Bivacuum.

For the other hand, the situation in secondary Bivacuum is diﬀerent.
It
is formed by strongly and locally asymmetric cell-dipoles, representing sub-
elementary particles and antiparticles and their coherent triplets. The local
asymmetry of matter is compensated by non-local and opposite asymmetry
of Bivacuum fermions and Bivacuum antifermions and shift of their dynamic
equilibrium:

BV F ↑ ⇋ BV F ↓

(15.1)

The internal circulation group and phase velocities of the actual vortex and
complementary rotor of sub-elementary fermions/antifermions are equal to ex-
ternal ones, providing the Hidden harmony and Golden mean conditions (section
4.2):

gr = vext

vin
ph ;

gr/c

= (vgr/vph)φ = φ

(15.2)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)
104

This condition determines the diﬀerence between the actual and complemen-
tary mass/energy, equal to the rest mass of elementary particle and frequency
of [C⇋ W ] pulsation, corresponding to resonant interaction with fundamental
oscillation of Bivacuum:

m+

C − m−

(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

conditions (15.2) is:

(15.3)

(15.4)

|e+ − e−|φ = φe

However, the diﬀerence between the actual and complementary magnetic
moments remains unchanged and equal to zero, like in primordial Bivacuum
dipoles. Due to symmetry compensation mechanisms, the total energy of sec-
ondary Bivacuum, like in primordial one also keeps unchanged and equal to
zero.

The nonlocal quantum entanglement between particles of coherent [C ⇋ W ]
pulsation has a mechanism of resonant exchange interaction, mediated by non-
local Bivacuum symmetry oscillations, accompanied the pulsation. The correct-
ness of our UM is conﬁrmed by good coincidence between calculated and exper-
imental values of magnetic moments of the electron. In accordance to UM, a
small deviation from the Bohr’s magneton is due to longitudinal zero-point oscil-
lation and corresponding group velocity (vk0) of the electron. The new physical
constant ”longitudinal zero-point factor”: z = (αφ)1/2 = (vk0/c) = 0.06715608,
where α = e2/~c = 0.0072973 is the electromagnetic ﬁne structure constant and
(φ = 0.618) is Golden mean, has been introduced.

The longitudinal zero-point oscillations of elementary charges are responsible
for electromagnetism and transversal zero-point oscillations for gravitation in
contrast to their rotation, creating the rest mass at Golden mean conditions.

The explanation of Searl and Bearden ’free’ energy machines action, com-

patible with energy conservation law, is proposed.

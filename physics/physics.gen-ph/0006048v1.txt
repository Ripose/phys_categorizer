Issues in Quantized Fractal Space Time

Abstract

In recent years, the picture of discrete space time has been studied
in the context of stochastic theory. There are a number of ramiﬁ-
cations, which are brieﬂy examined. We argue that the causality of
physiics has its roots in the analyticity within the two dimensons of a
fractal quantum path and further show how this picture has conver-
gence wth quantum superstrings.

1 Introduction

The concept of a discrete space time was formulated over ﬁfty years ago by
Schild, Snyder and others[1, 2]. It has survived over the years with varia-
tions through the works of Caldirola, Lee, Bombelli et al., Wolfe, the author
and others ([3]-[11]). Infact, space time points imply inﬁnite energies and
momenta, but Quantum Theory has lived with this self contradiction[12].
Devices like renormalization have therefore to be invoked.
A second approach which avoids the diﬃculties of both the classical smooth
and the discrete theory is that pioneered by Ord, Nottalee and El Naschie[54]-
[56]. Those authors assume the existence of a transﬁnite Cantor-like space
time Manifold E (∞).
This concept is also implicit in Dirac’s relativistic theory of the electron [13]:
Physically meaningful solutions arise only at and above the Compton scale.
Below it we have the zitterbewegung eﬀects.
Recently the author has pointed out that the electron can be fruitfully de-
scribed with a Kerr-Newman metric, avoiding a naked singularity by invoking

1

a discrete space time structure, which can be further pushed forward in the
context of a stochastic and fractal theory[14]-[18]. Such a formulation leads
to a uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and gravitation, and also shows up a
cosmology consistent with the large number relations and recent observa-
tions, apart from providing a rationale for many other apparently ad hoc
features. We will now brieﬂy examine the above formulation and some of its
ramiﬁcations.

2 The Kerr-Newman Formulation

It is well known that the Kerr-Newman metric describes the ﬁeld of an elec-
tron including the anomalous gyro magnetic ratio g = 2 [19] except that
there is an inadmissable naked singularity: The radius of the horizon for the
electron is given, in the usual notation by

r+ =

GM

c2 + ıb, b ≡   G2Q2

c8 + a2 −

G2M 2

c4 !1/2

(1)

It is to be noticed that the imaginary part of the radius in the above equa-
tion can be immediately identiﬁed with the imaginary part of the position
operator of a Dirac electron, viz.,

x = (c2p1H −1t + a1) +

ı
2

c¯h(α1 − cp1H −1)H −1,

(2)

The imaginary part in (26) gives the zitterbewegung and vanishes on averag-
ing over Compton scales. It has been stressed[14, 15] that the Compton scale
represents a minimum space time cut oﬀ, below which there is no meaningful
physics. Physics emerges on averaging over these scales.
These minimum cut oﬀ scales have been shown to arise due to a stochastic
underpinning [20, 21]. Indeed they give a meaning to Nelsonian and other
stochastic studies [22]-[25]. All this is symptomatic of a background Zero
Point Field or Quantum Vacuum which is the underpinning for the universe.
The above Kerr-Newman formulation of the electron becomes more mean-
ingful in a linearised General Relativistic context, where we have,

gµv = ηµv + hµv, hµv = Z 4Tµv(t − |~x − ~x′|, ~x′)

|~x − ~x′|

d3x′

Aµ = ¯hΓµσ

σ = ¯h

∂

∂xµ log(q|g|)

The justiﬁcation for the linearized theory is that even at the Compton scale
of the electron ∼ 10−11cms we are well outside the Schwarzchild radius of an
electron ∼ 10−56cms[26] so that the linearized theory is applicable. Starting
from (27) it has been shown that the correct spin, charge, gyro magnetic ratio,
and infact the Kerr Newman metric itself can be obtained. This metric gives
both the gravitational and the electromagnetic ﬁelds, and it has been shown
that this is symptomatic of and leads to the desired uniﬁcation of gravitation
and electromagnetism. The formulation is on the face of it similar to Weyl’s
original theory, except that what is crucial is the purely Quantum Mechanical
spinorial behaviour of the electron. Indeed the electromagnetic potential is
given by

which is apparently similar to the Weyl theory, except that this time the term
is not put in ad hoc as in the Weyl formulation, but rather arises naturally
due to the pseudo spinorial behaviour of the negative energy two component

spinor χ of the Dirac four spinor   Θ

χ !. All this has been discussed in detail

in the references[14, 15, 16].
Further at the Compton scale one gets a characterisation of the quark pic-
ture including such peculiar features as the fractional charge, handedness
and conﬁnement[18, 27, 20]. A crucial input here is the fact that while the
usual three dimensionality arises well outside the Compton scale due to spin
networks[19, 28], at the Compton scale itself we encounter lower dimension-
ality.
Indeed, in the closely related non-Quantum Mechanical relativistic
theory of particles [29], the centres of mass form a two dimensional disc
within the analogue of the Compton scale.
We also get a characterisation of the neutrino and weak interaction[30]. In-
deed in the above model the Compton wavelength of the neutrino becomes
inﬁnite as its mass vanishes and so the divide between the negative energy
spinors and the positive energy spinors of the four spinor as in the case of
the electron disappears, and along with it the double connectivitity of space
also. This immediately leads to the handedness of the neutrino [14]. Infact
the neutrino is the divide between the Fermionic and the Bosonic particle.

3 Cosmology

It is easy to see how the Kerr-Newman type electrons, or more generally
elementary particles can be formed out of a background Zero Point Field.
As is known the energy of the ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld in a region
of length λ is[19]

B2 ∼

¯hc
λ4

(4)

where B to the left side of (28) denotes the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld.
If λ is the Compton wavelength, then the right side ∼ mc2, that is the
whole particle can be created out of the background Zero Point Field. In
what follows we take a pion to be a typical elementary particle, as in the
literature, its mass being m. As there are N ∼ 1080 particles in the universe,
we should then have
(5)

Nm = M,

where M ∼ 1056gms is the mass of the universe. This is indeed so.
We can next deduce using the ZPF spectral density, the relation (cf.ref.[15]),
MαR where R is the radius of the universe. This is quite correct and in-
fact poses a puzzle, as is well known and it is to resolve this dependence
that dark matter has been postulated whereas in our formulation the correct
mass radius dependence has emerged quite naturally. Other interesting and
consistent consequences follow from the facts that the pion energy equals
its gravitational energy and that √N particles are ﬂuctuationally created in
Compton time τ :

GM

c2 = R,√N =

2mπc2

.T

(6)

(7)

where T is the age of the universe ≈ 1017secs, and,

H =

Gm3
πc
¯h2

,

It is remarkable that equation (7) is known to be true from a purely empirical
standpoint and is considered mysterious. Remembering that we are dealing
with order of magnitude relations, we can deduce from (6) and (7) that

d2R
dt2 = ΛR where Λ ≤ 0(H 2)

(8)

4

That is, a small cosmological constant cannot be ruled out. Equation (8)
explains the puzzling fact that, if Λ exists, why is it so small[31]. To proceed

we observe that the ﬂuctuation of ∼ √N in the number of particles leads to

√N =

e2
Gm2 ≈ 1040,

whence we get,

R = √N l,

Gm
lc2 =

1
√N

, G ∝ T −1,

(9)

T , in reasonably good agreement [32].

as also the fact that ˙G/G ∼ 1
Further, from the above we can deduce that the charge e is independant of
time or N. Infact we can treat m (or l), cand¯h as the only microphysical
constants and N as the only cosmological parameter, given which all other
parameters and constants follow.
We can now easily deduce from (6), (7) and (8), the following:

ρ ∝ T −1, Λ ≤ 0(T −2),

(10)

In our model the equation (6) actually provides an arrow of time, in terms
of the particle number N. Further, the cosmic background radiation can
be explained in terms of ﬂuctuations of interstellar Hydrogen[33].
In this
model the universe continues to expand for ever with according to (10) de-
creasing density (unlike in the Steady State model). Indeed the fact that the
universe would continue to expand for ever has since been observationally
conﬁrmed[34, 35]. Moreover, using (9) we can deduce the well known eﬀects
of General Relativity namely the precession of the perihelion of mercury, the
gravitational bending of light, a recently observed anomalous inward acceler-
ation in the solar system and the ﬂattened galactic rotational curves without
invoking dark matter[36, 30]. It may also be remarked that a background
Zero Point Field does indeed show up as a cosmological constant, as has been
shown in (Cf.ref.[30]).

4 Other Consequences

5

4.1 Weak Interactions

These can be characterised in terms of the semionic or anomalous statistics
of the neutrino, as noted in Section 2. Using this we can deduce that

mνc2
k ≈

√3T

(11)

At the present background temperature of about 2◦K, this gives a neutrino
mass

10−9me ≤ mν ≤ 10−8me

(12)

where me is the electron rest mass. It is remarkable that (11) is exactly what
is required to be deduced theoretically to justify recent models of lepton
conservation or in certain uniﬁcation schemes. We now observe that the
balance of the gravitational force and the Fermi energy of the cold background
neutrinos, gives[37]

GNνm2
ν

R

=

ν ¯h2
N 2/3
mνR2 ,

whence, Nν ∼ 1090
where Nν is the number of neutrinos, as indeed is known.
If the new weak force is mediated by an intermediate particle of mass M
and Compton wavelength L, we will get from the ﬂuctuation of the particle
number Nν, on using (12),

g2qNνL2 ≈ mνc2 ∼ 10−14,

(13)

From (13), on using the value of Nν, we get,g2L2 ∼ 10−59
This agrees with experiment and the theory of massless particles the neu-
trino speciﬁcally acquiring mass due to interaction[38], using the usual value
of M ∼ 100Gev.
Additionally there could be a long range force also, a ”weak electromag-
netism” with coupling ¯g. This time, in place of (13), we would have,

¯g2√Nν

R ≈ 10−8mνc2

(14)

Comparing (14) with a similar equation for the electron, we get[30],

¯g2/e2 ∼ 10−13

6

so that in eﬀect the neutrino will appear with an ”electric charge” a little
less than a millionth that of the electron.
Interestingly from an alternative perspective [39], it can be concluded that
the cosmological Neutrino background can mediate long range forces ∼ 1
for r << 1
In any case using the value of the Neutrino ”electrical” charge and treating
it like a Kerr-Newman black hole, as in the case of the electron it is easy to
deduce a magnetic moment for it:
We start with the relation[15]

r6 for r >> 1
T .

T and ∼ 1

r2

Gm2√N

c

¯h ∼

, where m is the electron mass. For the neutrino mass as given in (12) and
particle number Nν, the above becomes,

¯h′ ∼ 10−12¯h,

which is symptomatic of the bosonic (or spin zero) behaviour of the neutrino.
Using this value ¯h′ instead of ¯h, and the neutrino ”electric” charge and mass
as given above, we can deduce that its magnetic moment is given by

µν ∼ 10−11 Bohr magnetrons
Indeed, this is in agreement with known values [40].

4.2 Discrete Space-time Eﬀects

Within the above scheme, the neutral pion has been exhibited as a bound
state of an electron and a positron. At ﬁrst sight one would expect that such a
bound state would cause pair annihilation and would lead to the appearance
of two photons. However the existence of such a bound state is an imprint
of discrete space time as can be seen by the following argument: In this case
the the Schrodinger equation is given by (Cf. also [4])

HφT = EφT = φıh[

T (t + τ /2) − T (t − τ /2)

τ

]

(15)

where φ is the space part and T is the time part of the wave function and
τ is the minimum unit, the Compton time. From (15) one can deduce that

7

the most excited stable state appears at the critical value

¯h
τ ∼ mc2
It must be pointed out that the decay

E ∼
which is ofcourse the pion energy.
mode of the pion bears out these arguments.
Thus the existence of the pion as a bound state of an electron and a poistron
due to discrete space time is similar to the original Bohr orbits, at the birth
of Quantum Mechanics, as will be seen below.
In the same vein, it was argued that the Kaon decay puzzle, wherein time
reversibility is violated, could be explained on similar lines[41]. Let us now
consider the eﬀect more closely. Indeed it has been shown that the discrete-
ness leads to a non commutative geometry [20] viz.,

(16)

[x, y] = 0(l2), [x, px] = ı¯h[1 − l2]
If terms ∼ l2 are neglected we get back the usual
and similar equations.
Quantum Theory. However if we retain these terms, then we can deduce
the Dirac equation. Moreover it can be seen that given (16) space rerlection
symmetry no longer holds. This violation is an O(l2) eﬀect.
This is not surprising. It has already been pointed out [42] that the space
time divide viz., x + ıct arises due to the zitterbewegung or double Weiner
process in the Compton wavelength - and in this derivation terms ∼ (ct)2 ∼ l2
were neglected. However if these terms are retained, then we get a correction
to the usual theory including special relativity.
To see this more clearly let us (Cf.ref.[14, 43]) as a ﬁrst approximation treat
the continuum as a series of discrete points separated by a distance l, which
then leads to

Ea(xn) = E0a(xn) − Aa(xn + l) − Aa(xn − l)

(17)

When l is made to tend to zero, it was shown that from (17) we recover the
Schrodinger equation, and further, we have,

E = E0 − 2Acoskl.

(18)

The zero of energy was chosen such that E = 2A = mc2, the rest energy of
the particle (Cf.[14]), in the limit l → 0. However if we retain terms ∼ l2,

8

then from (18) we will have instead

E

mc2 − 1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∼ 0(l2)

The above shows the correction to the energy mass formula, where again we
recover the usual formula in the limit O(l2) ≈ 0.
It must be mentioned that all this would be true in principle for discrete
space time, even if the minimum cut oﬀ was not at the Compton scale.
Intuitively this should be obvious: Space time reﬂection symmetries are based
on a space time continuum picture.

4.3 A Mass Spectrum

It is possible to obtain the masses of diﬀerent elementary particles by con-
sidering them to be suitable bound states of the leptons, on the basis of their
decay modes, in the context of the above picture[44].
For example a proton could be considered to be a bound state of two positrons
and a central electron[17, 18]. In this case we recover the correct mass of the
proton, mP . There is also a string of excited states with masses (2n + 1)mP .
It is quite remarkable that the Ωc baryon has a mass nearly 3mP , after which
there is a big gap and the next baryon viz., Λv has a mass 5mP . Similarly
other shortlived baryons whose masses are odd multiples of the proton masses
can be expected.
Taking into account the rotational degrees of freedom, it is possible to get
an additional mass spectrum(Cf.ref.[44]) viz.,

mc2 =

2(n + 1/2)¯hω

1 − 5

6k2

,

where for n = 0 and k = 0, ¯hω = mP c2. For k = 1 this then gives a mass six
times that of a proton and so on we can generate a series of masses.

4.4 The Magnetic Eﬀects

If the electron is indeed a Kerr-Newman type charged black hole, it can be
approximated by a solenoid and we could expect an Aharonov-Bohm type

9

of eﬀect, due to the vector potential ~A which would give rise to shift in the
phase in a two slit experiment for example [45]. This shift is given by

while the shift due to the electric charge would be

∆δ ˆB =

e

¯h I ~A. ~ds

∆δ ˆE = −

e

¯h Z A0dt

(19)

(20)

where A0 is the electrostatic potential. In the above formulation (Cf.ref.[46],.
we would have

~A ∼

1
c

(21)
Substitution of (21) in (19) and (20) shows that the magnetic eﬀect ∼ v
times the electric eﬀect.
Further, the magnetic component of a Kerr-Newman black hole, as is well
known [19] is given by

A0

c

Bˆr =

2ea
r3 cosΘ + 0(

1
r4 ), B ˆΘ =

easinΘ

r3 + 0(

1
r4 ), B ˆφ = 0,

while the electrical part is

Eˆr =

e
r2 + 0(

1
r3 ), E ˆΘ = 0(

1
r4 ), E ˆφ = 0,

(22)

(23)

Equations (22) and (23) show that in addition to the usual dipole magnetic
ﬁeld, there is a shorter range magnetic ﬁeld given by terms ∼ 1
r4 . In this
context it is interesting to note that an extra B(3) magnetic ﬁeld of shorter
range and mediated by massive photons has indeed been observed and studied
over the past few years[47].

4.5 Uniﬁcation of Fluctuations

It is quite remarkable that in the preceding considerations, we get the grav-
itational and electromagnetic interactions as also the weak interaction from

ﬂuctuation in the particle number ∼ √Nν or √N, for example in the equa-

tions leading to (9) or (13).
It is thus the ﬂuctuation or what has been
characterised as non local eﬀects that underlie all the interactions[48] and
lead to a uniﬁed picture. It is interesting that El Naschie’s ﬂuctuon is very
much in this spirit[49].

10

4.6 Fractal Matter

It has been remarked earlier that as we approach the Compton wavelength,
there is a change in dimensionality - we go to two and one dimensions. Such a
low dimensional behaviour leads to fractional charges and superconductivity
type eﬀects[50, 51, 52].
It is indeed pleasing that experiments with car-
bon nano tubes already indicate such phenomenon. Thiis type of behaviour
should be exhibited by quarks also.

4.7 Miscellaneous Matters

a) The discrete space time or zitterbewegung has an underpinning that is
stochastic. The picture leads to the goal of Wheeler’s ’law without law’
[53, 20, 21]. Furthermore the picture that emerges is machian. This is evi-
dent from equations like (6), (7) and (9)– the micro depends on the macro.
So the ﬁnal picture that emerges is on of stochastic holism.
b) Another way of expressing the above point is by observing that the in-
teractions are relational. For example, in the equation leading to (9), if the
number of particles in the universe tends to 1, then the gravitational and
electromagnetic interactions would be equal, this happening at the Planck
scale, where the Compton wavelength equals the Schwarzchild radius[54, 55].
c) Infact as shown [42], when N the number of particles in the universe is
1 we have a Planck particle with a short life time ∼ 10−42secs due to the
Hawking radiation but with N ∼ 1080 particles as in the present universe we
have the pion as the typical particle with a stable life time ∼ of the age of
the universe due to the Hagedorn on radiation.
d) It is well known that there are 18 arbitrary parameters in contemporary
physics. We on the other hand have been working with the micro physical
constants referred to earlier viz., the electron (or pion) mass or Compton
wavelength, the Planck constant, the fundamental unit of charge and the
velocity of light. These along with the number of particles N as the only free
parameter can generate the mass, radius and age of the universe as also the
Hubble constant.
If we closely look at the equation leading to (9) giving the gravitational and
electromagnetic strength ratios, we can actually deduce the relation,

l =

e2
mc2

11

(24)

In other words we have deduced the pion mass in terms of the electron
mass, or, given the pion mass and the electron mass, we have deduced the
ﬁne structure constant. From the point of view of the order of magnitude
theory in which the distinction between the electron, pion and proton gets
blurred, what equation (24) means is, that the Planck constant itself depends
on e and c (and m). Further in the Kerr-Newman type characterisation of
the electron, the charge e is really equivalent to the spinorial tensor density
(N = 1), Cf.ref.[14]. In this sense e also is pre determined and we are left with
a minimum length viz. the Compton length and a minumum time viz. the
Compton time (or a maximal velocity c) as the only fundamental constants.

APPENDIX

A Brief Note on Analyticity and Causality, and the ”Levels of
Physics”

In previous communications[1, 2] it was argued that within the Compton
wavelength of a fractal Brownian path the one dimensional coordinate x be-
comes complex. That is x becomes x + ıx′ where, further it was shown that
x′ = ct, and it was argued that this is the origin of Special Relativity. It
is relevant to mention that complex time has also been considered by El
Naschie[3, 4].
Within the Compton scale we have a Hawking-Hartle[5] situation, where
time becomes imaginary and static - in these regions space time can be rep-
resented by the compact rotation group. This is also from the point of view of
ordinary space-time, the unphysical zitterbewegung region, and as Dirac[6]
pointed out, physics begins after an integration over this region. Outside
the Compton scale however, which is our physical domain[7], we have the
Minkowski metric.
Interestingly it was argued[1] that the above consideration was also at the
root of the complex wave function of Quantum Mechanics, which diﬀerenci-
ates it from classical physics. Infact if we take the Quantum Mechanical wave
function to be the carrier of as much physical information of the state as is
possible then we can argue that because the ﬁrst time derivative of the wave
function is then not required, unlike in classical theory, where position and
velocity are independantly required, it is necessary that the wave function be
complex in order to preserve causality[8]. Indeed if the wave function were
real, we would have a stationary picture with a constant probability current.
Within the Compton scale, that is in the domain of the Hawking-Hartle static
time t′, we have

x2 + y2 + z2 + c2 + t′2 = invariant

(25)

Further, analyticity demands the Cauchy-Reimann equations which lead to,
in this case, the Laplacian operator equation,

"∇2 +

1
c2

∂2

∂t′2# ψ = 0

(26)

However, when we cross over to the domain of our usual physics, ﬁrstly t′ goes
over to ıt, where t is our physical time. Secondly the region of analyticity

16

in our physical world is the region outside the Compton wavelength, and
excludes the region within which is the unphysical zitterbewegung region of
non local or superluminal eﬀects (Cf.[6]). So as Dirac pointed out, after the
integration over the unphysical Compton scale, and remembering that,

ψ = √ρeıS,

where ρ is the probability density of x(t), so that an integration of ψψ∗ over
the Compton region gives the mass, we get, instead of (25) and (26),

x2 + y2 + z2 − c2t2 = invariant

2ψ = mc2ψ

(27)

(28)

Equation (27) is the Minkowski metric while equation (28) can be easily
recognised as the Klein-Gordon equation.
There is another way to derive the D’Alembertian in (28). For this we use
(27), along with the fact that, precisely due to the double Weiner process
at the Compton scale, referred to above, as pointed out by Nottale[9] the
energy momentum operators are given by

 ¯h

ı

~∇,

¯h
ı

∂

∂t!

Thus causality in the physical world as expressed by (27) or (28) is related
to analyticity within the unphysical Compton region.
We next observe that as above, the discretization at the Compton scale leads
to the commutation relations[10, 11]:

[x, px] = ı¯h[1 − l2]

(29)

Equation (29) implies a correction to the usual uncertainity relation, due
to the minimum space-time cut oﬀ. This is exactly the case in Quantum
superstrings[12, 13]. There also, due to duality, a minimum cut oﬀ emerges
and we have the equation (29).
What we would like to point out is that we are seeing here diﬀerent levels of
physics. Indeed, rewriting (29) as,

[x, ux] = ı[l − l3],

17

we can see that if l = 0, we have classical physics, while if 0(l3) = 0, we have
Quantum Mechanics and ﬁnally if 0(l3) 6= 0 we have the above discussed
fractal picture, and from another point of view, the superstring picture.
Interestingly, in our case the electron Compton wavelength l ∼ 1011cm, so
that 0(l3) ∼ 10−33 as in string theory.

QUANTUM PROFILES AND PARADOXES

FRANK BORG

Abstract. This paper discusses questions concerning the foun-
dations of quantum mechanics (entanglement, wave collapse, irre-
versibility) with reference to the issues raised during a Minisympo-
sium held in Helsinki, 1.6-3.6 in 1992, where A Shimony, A Peres
and B d’Espagnat were invited to lecture. The measurement prob-
lem is related to the phenomenon of irreversibility which is known
not to follow from any fundamental theory; e.g., the law of ex-
ponential decay does not follow from the Schr¨odinger equation in
senso stricto. The approximations that lead to irreversibility are
related to some form of ”forgetting”, or coarse graining. Some
approaches to the question, why these approximations can be jus-
tiﬁed, are reviewed. The paper also discusses dynamical reduction
schemes and it is suggested, that the corresponding non-linear
modiﬁcations of the Schr¨odinger equation – which lead to non-
conservation of energy – are actually ”eﬀective” Schr¨odinger equa-
tions for open systems (in analogy with the ”eﬀective” Lagrangians
in QFT). Thus these modiﬁcations should be derived from a fun-
damental theory of interactions. The paper ends with some brief
comments on the mind-body question in the quantum mechanical
context. A postscript has been added (2006).

The problem of the meaning
of ”reality” is too much
philosophical to be addressed
and resolved by the present
paper

Namiki and Pascazio (1991)

1. Introduction

In his classic text (Jammer, 1974) on the various interpretations of
quantum mechanics Jammer comments – after having devoured some
500 authors and their proposed solutions to the quantum enigmas:

The endless stream of publications suggesting new the-
ories of measurement and modiﬁcations of ideas earlier
proposed as well as the unending discussions and sym-
posia on this topic are an eloquent indication of the gen-
eral discomfort felt among the physicists on this issue.

Finland, a country of a thousand conferences, has also assumed its re-
sponsibility for keeping the quantum symposia carousel spinning. The
city of Joensuu has been an active part sponsoring a series of con-
ferences on The Foundations of Modern Physics (1977, 1985, 1987,
1990). However, this year even Joensuu is hemorrhaging because of
the general economic backlash. Despite this it was possible to arrange
a minispymposium during some sunny days in the beginning of June
at the physics department of the university of Helsinki with its kind
support (Laurikainen and Montonen, 1993). The ”stars” of the sympo-
sium consisted of the triumvirate made up of Bernard d’Espagnat (Or-
say, France), Abner Shimony (Boston, USA) and Asher Peres (Haifa,
Israel). d’Espagnat has achieved a reputation (vide d’Espagnat (1984,
1988, 1989)) as an incisive analyzer of the conceptual-philosophical
foundations of quantum mechanics, and for having introduced the con-
cept of the ”veiled reality” which refers to something that cannot by
studied by traditional scientiﬁc methods – he suggests that poetry
maybe oﬀers a link to this reality. Peres started his physics career
as nuclear engineer. He gives the impression of a hardnosed problem
solver but with talents of a comedian not unlike Woody Allen. Other
physicists have classiﬁed him as a positivist, among them Abner Shi-
mony who is a very jovial professor who feels at home among neutrons.
He describes himself as student of Carnap, and he is able to give a
penetrating lecture on some subtle points by Kant or Berkeley at any
time. Car engines he ﬁnds, however, to be diﬃcult to understand;
indeed, this involves an important philosophical point (complicated
phenomena should be reduced to simple constituents which are easier
to understand). With the lectures of the symposium as a background

we will in the next sections discuss some central issues in quantum
mechanics.

2. Open realism

d’Espagnat deﬁnes his philosophical view as ”open realism”; exis-
tence precedes knowledge; something exists independently of us even
if it cannot be described. Berkeleyean idealism, phenomenalism, pos-
itivism, anti-realism, internal realism and similar philosophies assume
that one only observes mental pictures, not objects, whence there is no
need to presuppose the reality of objects per se. Shimony summarizes
Berkeley’s arguments for idealism in two points:

a The description of things only involves thoughts
b Matter (quantity) cannot explain perception (qualia)

d’Espagnat’s objections against idealism rest on two propositions:

a Experience and knowledge implicate the existence of conscious-

ness (mind)

b One may be wrong (reality ”says no”); that is, just any theo-
ries do not work, there is something (”objective reality”) which
resists

Coming as far as Samuel Johnson (kicking the famous stone to refute
Berkeley) and accepting a reality, d’Espagnat asks whether this reality
is intelligible.
Indeed, quantum mechanics challenges any physicist-
philosopher with realist inclinations, which Albert Einstein realized
from early on. Einstein pointed to the apparently instantaneous ”tele-
pathic” collapse of the wave functions; an aspect that was brought to
its head in the famous Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paper (Einstein et al.,
1935). Schr¨odinger (1935) concluded immediately that the fundamen-
tal point of the EPR-argument was the ”entanglement” of the compos-
ite system. Thus, two systems S1 and S2 constitute through interaction
a total system S1 + S2 whose state vector in general is of the form

where

) belong to the Hilbert space H1 (H2) for the system
S1 (S2). If we, as Schr¨odinger did, identify the state of an object/system
with its statevector, it follows that for an entanglement state (1) (which
) the subsystems S1
in general cannot be factorized on the form
and S2 will lack deﬁnitive physical states. This conclusion also applies
with regards to the physical properties if we identify these with the

eigenvalues of the corresponding operators. Therefore, even if the total
system S1+S2 is in a deﬁnitive state this does not in general apply for its
subsystems. This consequence makes quantum mechanics, according to
d’Espagnat quoting H Weyl, ”the ﬁrst holistic theory that works”. At
the same time this property creates problems for every attempt to make
an ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics which ascribes to
all systems/objects deﬁnitive physical states and properties at every
instant of time.

The entanglement situation arises also in the case where the system
S1 is an object which interacts with an apparatus S2 during a measure-
ment process. In order that the process should result in a deﬁnitive
of the measurement apparatus it is necessary that the su-
state
perposition Eq.(1) is reduced on the factorized form
which
is generally impossible in quantum mechanics. Indeed, the quantum

d’Espagnat distinguishes three genuinely ontological approaches to

quantum mechanics:

(1) Pilot-wave theories (de Broglie, D Bohm)
(2) Other hidden variable theories (Belinfante, 1973)
(3) Theories of dynamical reduction (Ghirardi et al., 1986; Pearle,

1984; K´arolyh´azy et al., 1986)

According to the pilot-wave theories (Bohm, 1952a,b) the objectively
existing particles are directed by a ﬁeld Ψ which, at least approxi-
mately, satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation (SE). If we write the ﬁeld Ψ
as

L de Broglie proposed that the wave equation has two sorts of so-
lutions (double-solution theory): the ordinary SE solution which only
describes the statistical behaviour of the particles, and a singular so-
lution which represents the localized particles themselves. A O Barut
has recently presented a similar theory where the singular solutions of
de Broglie corresponds to a soliton, ”small psi”, while the ”big psi”
is the conventional Schr¨odinger wave function which can only be in-
terpreted statistically (Barut, 1990, 1991).2 Bohm’s theory does not
say anything about the structure of the particles (except that they
have classical properties like momentum and position). His primary
objective has been to demonstrate the very possibility of an ontologi-
cal quantum theory (Bohm et al., 1987). To the group (b) above one
might count e.g. theories of the sort presented by Dennis Dieks, Simon
Kochen and Richard Healey (Dieks, 1989; Kochen, 1985; Healey, 1989).
Similarly to the group (a) -theories, these theories distinguish between

classical transition. J. S. Bell has commended it for its pedagogical merits (see

two kinds of states: on the hand the quantum state (represented by the
wave function), on the other hand the physical/dynamical state which
is always deﬁned for all objects in contrast to the quantum states which
may not be deﬁned in entanglement situations. In these approaches the
starting point is a special bi-orthonormal decomposition (which goes
back to E Schmidt 1907; vide von Neumann (1932)) of the entangle-
ment state Eq.(1):

The fact that d’Espagnat includes the third group above among the
genuine ontological theories may seem a bit surprising. The dynam-
ical reduction theories mainly show that the superposition states for
macroscopic systems get suppressed. The entanglement issue remains
alive for the micro-objects, as well as also for the macro-objects during
the time till the superposition has been reduced beyond practical ver-
iﬁcation. No ontological states have been ascribed to the subsystems
in the entanglement state. The same objection can be raised against
theories which explain the reduction in terms of inﬂuence of the en-
vironment, which d’Espagnat indeed rejects as non-ontological. The
diﬀerence seems to be that d’Espagnat assumes that the wave function
in case of the dynamical reduction theories describes an independent
reality (again causing trouble in the entanglement situation), while the
environmental theories describe a ”subjective reality”. Yet, both kinds
of theories seem equally ambiguous on this point. d’Espagnat however
reasons that the environment theories presuppose an ensemble inter-
pretation of quantum mechanics which implies that quantum mechan-
ics cannot describe individual systems and hence must be incomplete;
ergo, the environment theories can only explain the wave collapse by
extending quantum mechanics with ”hidden variables”. This is the so-
lution chosen e.g. by Dieks who combines his ontological commitment
with environment theories (decoherence) in order to explain how the
physical states are realized in the measurement process.

For d’Espagnat the wave function is not an element of the physical
reality, rather it represents an ensemble. Reality per se (Being) is

QUANTUM PROFILES AND PARADOXES

either ”pure X” (Kant) or ”veiled”. The former alternative leads to
idealism which is rejected by d’Espagnat. Idealism e.g. presupposes
that the concepts are evident (Anschaulichkeit, Kant; lumen naturale,
Descartes) which seems to be in conﬂict with the fact that we now
and then have to revise our concepts and theories as a consequence
of new ﬁndings and theoretical developments. Concerning the veiled
reality d’Espagnat is only able to tell that it transcends human reason
(and is in this sense ”irrational”). It cannot be studied using scientiﬁc
methods which are restricted to the ”empirical reality”.

3. Dynamic reductions

Professor Shimony plans to devote the next few years attempting to
derive the wave collapse by manipulating the SE. The Ghirardi-Weber-
Rimini (GWR) ansatz constitutes the archetypical model (Ghirardi et al.,
1986). The non-linear GWR-modiﬁcation of the SE can be interpreted
as a stochastic process where the wave function for each particle is
reduced, according to a Poisson-process with a characteristic time con-
1016 s, on a wave function which localizes the position to
stant 1/λ
10−7 m (vide Bell (1987a)). That is,
a region of the dimension a
the wave function Ψ(r, t) evolves according to the SE except for ran-
dom occasions (separated by an average time 1/λ) where it makes a
”quantum jump” and is reduced on the form

In terms of the density matrix ρ the GWR-process implies that dur-

(Nota bene – by using density matrices we are restricted to describing
the statistical development. In the discussions of the GWR-models it is
not always clear how they interpret the wave function. In case it repre-
sents the physical state we are still left with the entanglement problem
for micro-objects. The ensemble interpretation seems to be the other
alternative but this interpretation denounces the collapse problem from
the very outset – vide Jammer (1974, ch.10) and Home and Whitaker
(1992).) The Gaussian weighing is deﬁned by

Besides the energy E(t) = tr( ˆHρ(t)) is not conserved in the GWR-
theory but increases with ca 10−21J per second for a macroscopic sys-

kinetic energy than a plane wave having the same momentum. The

Apparently we need an energy input in order to sustain the GWR-

With regards to the modiﬁcations of the SE Shimony proposes at
present only the general equation VACUUM = LETHE (= the river of
oblivion), and suggests that the experimental results of the quantum
telegraphy involving 3-level systems may provide constraints on the
possible modiﬁcations of the SE. (The quantum telegraph is connected
with the so called quantum Zeno eﬀect (Chiu et al., 1977; Block and Berman,
1991; Frerichs and Schenzle, 1991) which in the 3-level case has been
treated as a system coupled to a reservoir. The Zeno eﬀect denotes
the situation where a continuous observation of an unstable system
prevents it from decaying; the observation reduces the wave packet
constantly to the initial state. The watched pot eﬀect is another illus-
trative name for the eﬀect.)

The non-conservation of the energy (still quite minimal correspond-
ing to a temperature increase of 10−15K year for an ideal gas (Ghirardi et al.,
1986)) in the GWR-theory may indicate that it describes an open sys-
tem and that the GWR-equation Eq.(11) represents an ansatz to an
”eﬀective” SE for a system coupled to its environment. One might
think of an analogy with the ”eﬀective” Lagrange-functions (or ac-
tions) used in QFT which incorporate some of the eﬀects of vacuum
polarizations and other interactions. From this point of view one ought
to derive the ”eﬀective” SE from a fundamental theory of interacting
particles, given that the ordinary SE is valid for closed systems and free
particles. One aspect of this problem is studied for objects interacting
with a reservoir (Meystre and Sargent, 1990). All the decay processes
can be related to this case. A classical model is formed by an harmonic
oscillator a (the object) coupled to a surrounding represented by a set
of oscillators bk, according to the Hamiltonian,

π +π (Lipkin,

1973, ch.7), atomic transitions A⋆
A + γ (the Weisskopf-Wigner
theory of spontaneous emission (Weisskopf and Wigner, 1930)). Gen-
erally Eq.(20) quantum optical phenomena where a system (an atom)
is coupled to a broad band system (reservoir) which absorbs the ex-
citations and causes back reactions. Eq.(20) is the foundation of the
Weisskopf-Wigner equations, Kramers-Kronig relations, Pauli master-
equations, quantum mechanical Langevin- and Fokker-Planck equa-
tions. The common property for these systems is that they repre-
sent irreversible decays (dissipation, friction, diﬀusion) whose time-
asymmetric forms contradict the timesymmetric nature of the funda-
mental equations. The exponential decay cannot be derived from the
SE in senso stricto, which has i.a. been observed by Eugen Merzbacher
(quoted by Cartwright (1983)): ”The fact remains that the exponential
decay law, for which we have so much empirical support in radioactive
processes, is not a rigorous consequence of quantum mechanics but the
result of somewhat delicate approximations” (Merzbacher, 1970, p.484-
5). Similar considerations apply in classical mechanics – reversible
Hamiltonian equations cannot lead to dissipative processes. An appar-
ently elementary phenomenon such as friction seems to lack theoretical
foundation. Cartwright (1983) has employed examples like the above
ones to argue for the primary role of the approximations (phenomeno-
logical equations) in physics at the expense of the exact (fundamental)
equations, which seldom describe the empirical reality but rather some
ﬁnely tuned models. Cartwright points out that Weisskopf and Wigner
(1930) in the beginning only derived an exponential decay term from
Eq.(20). However, after the discovery 1947 by Willis Lamb and R C
Retherford of the ”Lamb-shift” between the levels 22P1/2 and 22S1/2
in hydrogen (∆E = 0.437 10−5eV = 1058 MHz) did Hans Bethe also
ﬁnd the Lamb-shift hidden in Eq.(20) using a new approximation pro-
cedure (Bethe, 1947). Cartwright’s conclusion is that ”the Schr¨odinger
equation does not make a claim whether there is a Lamb shift in the
circumstances described”. In a sense we use the equations in order to
obtain results we already know, not in order to predict them; that is,
we can calculate the transition probabilities using Born approximations
etc, but the very fact of the transition as an event cannot be accounted
for by quantum mechanics (which Einstein already pointed out). The
GWR-model however introduces the reduction already on the micro-
physical level. There are also models that introduce dissipation on the

micro-physical level through non-linear modiﬁcations of the SE; one
example is the ansatz (setting ~ = 1)

by Gisin (1990) where k > 0 is a quantum friction coeﬃcient (for a
generalization see Huang et al. (1989)). The problem with these mod-
els seems to be that the conventional theory approximates quite well
the experimental results whence there is little room for modiﬁcations of
the SE. Thus it has been suggested (Gisin, 1990) that a non-linear SE
(Weinberg, 1989) may imply the possibility of superluminal comminca-
tions in contradiction with the special theory of relativity. Polchinski
(1991) argues that such modiﬁcations may also lead to communica-
tions (Everett phone) between diﬀerent branches of a multi-verse wave
functions. (His example involves a non-linear Hamilton operator which
depends on the observer’s choices, whence it is no surprise that he con-
cludes that ”the apparatus reads the observer’s mind”. In physics we
had rather expect the ”observer” to be described by an Hamiltonian.)
As a conclusion we might say that the most reasonable interpretation
of the non-linear modiﬁcations of the SE which implies energy non-
conservation is that they are about open systems; the equations should
therefore be based on some fundamental theory of interaction.

One approach to the problems involving object-reservoir/environment-

interaction, which seems to be shared by i.a. Peres (1986) and Zurek
(1989), is to be content with the approximative irreversible solutions
of Eq.(20). The idea is that we observe irreversible processes because
we cannot observe the whole (reversible) process; information is lost
to the environment (dissipation = displacement of information). The
approximative assumptions leading from Eq.(20) to the irreversible so-
lutions are based on an assumption of some sort of memory loss; e.g.,
restricted correlation with the surrounding (Markov ansatz).
In the
classical analysis L Boltzmann introduced 1872 the Stosszahlenansatz
according to which the colliding atoms (hard spheres in the model)
loose their ”memory” of their state before the collision. This entails
an obvious time-asymmetry (for a simpliﬁed version of the Boltzmann
analysis see (Baker, 1986)). The classical Navier-Stokes equation in
hydrodynamics is also based on a form of memory loss represented by
the viscosity term (for derivations of such phenomenological equations
from fundamental principles see (Emch, 1986)). Theories and interpre-
tations which attempt only to account for the practically measurable
(in a statistical description) by using various forms of ”memory loss”
and coarse graining can be called FAPP theories (FAPP = For All
Practical Purposes). For instance Zurek (1982) is content with demon-
strating the wave collapse in a FAPP theory.

Omn`es concludes that the superposition of states 1 and 2 (
|

q2| ≫
Common to all the decoherence models, the above included, is that
they cannot prove the superposition between macroscopic states van-
ishes in a ﬁnite time. (Several models employ the Riemann-Lebesgue
lemma in order to show that ρoﬀ-diag →
1980)). Dieks accepts the dechoerence models as solutions to the
measurement problem in union with his ontological assumption; the
decoherence means that the ”real/physical” states approaches deﬁn-
itive values in the measurement process. Omn`es observes that the
exact solutions to Eq.(30) (for a ﬁnite number N of oscillators) pre-
dict a Poincar´e recurrence; that is, for any given time t > 0 there
is a time T > t such that (α(T ), β(T )) approaches the initial state
(α(0), β(0)) arbitrarily closely which contradicts the exponential law
of decay Eq.(35). (For atoms which interacts with single mode ﬁelds,
N = 1, one obtains explicitly periodic solutions which manifested in
Rabi-ﬂopping, or Jaynes-revival of apparently collapsed atomic states,
see Meystre and Sargent (1990)). According to Omn`es this means that
even classical physics entails a fuzzy logic (since Poincar´e recurrence
applies to classical mechanics, see Arnold (1978)) which are in har-
mony with the ”apparent” validity of the decay law. He compares the
statistical probability of the Poincar´e recurrence with the probability
that the Earth would suddenly move, through quantum tunneling, and
start to circle around Sirius.

A general class of decoherence models attempts to demonstrate that

This may be interpreted as a proof for the wave collapse; that is, that
or
the superposition Eq.(41) has collapsed on either of the states
φ2i
. The density matrix provides us though only with a statistical
|
description (averages and probabilities) and cannot hence prove that
an actual collapse takes place in which a superposition
ends
φki
up in a deﬁnitive state
It can thus not predict an event (the
object assuming deﬁnitive states/values). A statistical description may
allow a body to be at one place at one moment, and then at another
moment – with no continuous passage through the space – to appear at
another place (whose position is only statistically determined). This
argument is presented i.a. by Cartwright as a demonstration of the
need to accept the wave collapse as a physical process and not merely
as a statistical description. Bell (1987b) has moreover observed that it
is always possible in principle to ﬁnd an operator ˆO

Thus by measuring the operator ˆO(t) we can detect an interference

while the reduced form ˜ρ Eq.(42) neglects all observables associ-
ated with the environment. Supporters of the FAPP-models, such as
Omn`es, rejoin that the proposed observables ˆO(t) are in practice not
measurable. The probability that such ”supermeasurements” will yield
non-trivial results is ”much smaller than the limit one must accept for
classical logic” (Omn`es, 1990). Asher Peres agrees – it is impossible for
us to keep a tab on all the environmental variables. The wave collapse,
according to Peres, is nothing more than the result of the necessity to
restrict the observation to a subsystem in which the loss of information

QUANTUM PROFILES AND PARADOXES

19

will be manifested by reduced density matrices and equations involv-
ing irreversibility. For Peres the interpretational problem in quantum
mechanics concerns a translation from the language of Hilbert space
structure to the language of the classical phase space. This translation
from the language of quantum mechanics to the language of classical
physics then gives rise to the irreversibility as an aspect of the lan-
guages (displacement of information). Quantum mechanics with its
unitary time evolutions is not a theory of events, according to Peres –
he deﬁnes quantum mechanics as ”a limiting case for inﬁnite systems
with no back-reactions”. Similarly Zurek (1982) also links the wave
packet reduction to a limited information capacity. One consequence
of Zurek’s ideas is that if

states of macroscopic
Distinction (PSD) advanced by Schr¨odinger:
systems that can be told apart by macroscopic observations remain
separated whether observed or not (Jammer, 1974, p.216); that is, the
state Eq.(47) cannot be a superposition state. This criterion can be
applied to the Schr¨odinger cat state

when it is assumed that the states ”dead” and ”living” can be distin-
guished through a non-obtrusive observation. The PSD-principle might
be connected to the superselection condition in the following way: PSD
is based on the assumption that the observation of the macroscopic sys-
tem changes it only by adding a phase factor and that this does not
change the physical situation. According to this, the states

5. Mind and physics

Abner Shimony distinguishes two traditions within philosophy and

science:

•

•

One tradition which tries to ”close the circle” between episte-
mology and metaphysics; theories should not only describe the
phenomena but also explain their existence and connect them
with their ontological basis. Within this tradition Shimony
counts members like Einstein, Aristotle, Leibniz and White-
head.
The other tradition studies epistemology (the condition for knowl-
edge and phenomena) without an ontological grounding. As
representative members Shimon mentions Bohr, Kant, Hume,
Nietzsche and the linguistically oriented philosophers (Wittgen-
stein?).3

Shimony expresses sympathy for the former alternative since it is,
from a ”global” perspective, more fruitful, has a larger explanatory
force and aims at a coherent world view. These arguments are not
unlike the ones presented by Max Planck in support of realism (in
Vortr¨age und Erinnerungen, 1949, discussed in (Howard, 1979)). Shi-
mony presents a parable (a movie projected on a screen) which can be
compared to the cave parable invented by Plato where chained prisoner
in the cave were only able to see shadow of people on the walls. The
movements of the shadows seem chaotic and incomprehensible till they
realize that the shadows are produced by real bodies and their move-
ments. According to Shimony it is equally reasonably to assume that

3Shimony’s two traditions are not unlike the Galilean tradition (mechanistic,
causal, predictions) and the Aristotelian tradition (teleological, understanding) that
were analyzed by von Wright (1971).

all physical phenomena have an ontological grounding which can ex-
plain their cause and nature (a causal argument for micro-objects). By
applying this philosophy to the wave collapse in quantum mechanics it
follows that we should attempt at ﬁnding a physical explanation for the
collapse, for instance by modifying the SE as suggested by Shimony.

Professor K V Laurikainen, who has played a central role in arrang-
ing the physics symposia in Finland, has followed a diﬀerent track in his
lectures. He thinks the question of reality is a psychological question.
The meaning of the wave collapse is that the observer becomes aware
of the measurement results; the wave collapse takes place in the mind
of the observer, according to Laurikainen. From this point of view one
may understand the claims that the psyche must be taken into con-
sideration in discussing the foundations of quantum mechanics. Peres
rejoins that consciousness is only involved in the presentation of the
measurement data, not in the measurement process itself. Shimony is
more sympathetic and he would prefer a mentalistic ontology (objective
idealism) to pure physicalism, but he cannot accept Laurikainen’s point
of view which he summarizes as that the consciousness causes the wave
collapse. However, Laurikainen does not accept this interpretation and
emphasizes that the collapse takes place in the consciousness. Yet if
consciousness has no causal role in the wave collapse then there are
few reasons to believe that it plays any physical role whatsoever in the
measuring process (besides the ”trivial” fact that physicists and engi-
neers have designed the experiments and the devices). The assumption
that the wave collapse takes place in the consciousness implies in the
end that everything takes place in the consciousness, all objectiﬁcations
are a mental process. That leads us back to Machian positivism which
deﬁnes physics as a part of psychology, as an economic description of
perception data and mental states. Perhaps not such an inspiring idea
for physics.

The measurement process involves fundamental physical principles
which are responsible for the Pauli-exclusion (explaining e.g. electron
”shells”), superﬂuidity, radioactive decay, Bragg-interference, etc. In
none of these cases is the mind presumed to be a causal factor. On
the contrary, the physical theories have been developed to explain why
we see all these diﬀerent phenomena. However, by this it is not im-
plicated that consciousness can be reduced to the motion of electrons
and protons (or behaviouristic reﬂexes of the larynx).
It seems ob-
vious that thoughts/feelings are not equivalent to (but probably con-
tingent/supervenient) with particle states in the way e.g. an electric
current is equivalent with a collective motion of electrons. This is the
lasting Cartesian insight (or ”common sense”) into the dualism between
res extensa (matter) and res cogitans (soul). Quantum mechanics has
not been able to transcend this dualism despite some quantum mystical
trends (Zukav, 1979; Talbot, 1988; Zohar, 1990; de Restivo, 1983). Yet

it is natural to expect that quantum mechanics as a fundamental theory
will have consequences for the understanding of the ”psycho-physical
parallel”; that is, the ”correlation” between the physical and mental
states (the mind-body problem). Thus, Wigner (1961) envisaged that
the mind implicates a non-linear SE since it cannot be described in
terms of the conventional linear SE. According to his friend-argument
an observer cannot exist in a superposition of the form

which is presumed by the conventional quantum mechanical formal-
ism in the Schr¨odinger cat cases. Wigner introduces consciousness as
a causal agent as it causes the wave collapse. Another approach is
to attempt at constructing quantum mechanical models for the ”brain
states”. Thus, Marshall (1989) has suggested a model for brain states
based on the boson condensate model presented by Fr¨olich (1968).
(Such approaches will be discussed in a separate paper. For a discus-
sion of quanta, mind and brain see (Lockwood, 1989; Penrose, 1989).)
Laurikainen however does not express any interest in such models. He
sees the lack of strict causality in nature as an evidence of a pan-psyche
in the nature. While Descartes and Newton found evidence of the hand
of God in the lawfulness of the universe,4 Laurikainen ﬁnds clues for
pantheism in the ”irrational” quantum indeterminism. Without argu-
ing against or for pan-psychism one may still be inclined to think that
a direct philosophical-theological linking to quantum mechanics would
put an end to physics (Laurikainen for instance rejects the application
of quantum mechanics to cosmology by pointing to the constraining
concept of the observer (Laurikainen, 1991, p.136)). However there
are still jobs to do for theoretical physics; for instance, little attention
has been paid to the problem of deriving ”classical” collective variables
from quantum mechanics. One possibility is that quantum mechanics
is not valid for macroscopic bodies. This question has been studied in
a series of papers by Leggett (1986) in connection with quantum eﬀects
in superconducting materials. Finally, the question of the relation be-
tween quantum mechanics, relativity and gravitation still remains wide
open. We expect to return to this question when the appropriate oc-
casion arises. —

4The Newtonian gravitation was seen as an evidence for an invisible spiritual
reality and was employed as an argument against atheists (Jacob, 1988). With
the entrance of quantum mechanics matter becomes spiritualized – Zukav (1979)
suggests that quantum particles are conscious – the cricket ball matter is just a
myth (Davies and Gribbin, 1991) whence the genius of atheism has been defeated

6.1. Afterthoughts. In the paper there are expressions of the form
x
0 that surely seems odd to a mathematician. Of course, in physics,
what is ”big” and ”small” depends on the context. Generally it is a
question of comparing the order of magnitudes. Thus, e.g. x
0 may
1. What is ”small” relates to the ques-
be understood as log(
|
tion on what can be considered as ”negligible” in a given context. In
physics we cannot expect absolute certainty or inﬁnite accuracy. But
where to draw the boundary between blissful ignorance and anomalies?
If a theory or a model predicts quantities to a precision of ǫ, then any
experimental deviation larger than ǫ would naturally be interpreted
as a refutation of the theory/model. Because of our ﬁnitude (one of
the Kantian themes) there appears to be a limit to the precisions ǫ we
can attain. For instance the energy non-conservation implied by the
GWR-process seems to be negligible for all practical purposes. On the
other hand, the discussions of ﬁne tunings related to the cosmological
”constant” Λ have revealed that even the 100th decimal of Λ may be
of far reaching consequence for the evolution of the universe. As far as
the physical world (or rather our description of it) is subjected to strin-
gent laws, expressed e.g.
in terms of diﬀerential equations, problems
involving ﬁne tuning can hardly be avoided. Of course it is a logical
possibility that our ”laws of physics” are valid only in some restricted
range of parameters and that there is no bottoming out. While our
descriptions of nature in physics are formulated in terms of more or
less rigorous and exacting mathematics (Steiner, 1998), nature is not
mathematics (pardon Platon!). Mathematics and experiments give a
measure of how ”close”, in a sense, our descriptions and the nature (or
some local ”domain” of it) touch each other on some point. Perhaps
a successful ”theory of everything” would just be another reminder of
that we are enclosed in a ”bubble” of ignorance, stranded on a ”self-
contained” island, or chained prisoners in Platon’s metaphorical cave?

6.2. K V Laurikainen (1916–1997). Prof K V Laurikainen was a
primus motor behind the series of symposia on the foundations of mod-
ern physics that were arranged in Finland 1977 – 1994, and which at-
tracted the topnotch investigators in quantum mechanics from over the
world.5

As a student Laurikainen was greatly inﬂuenced by the mathemati-
cian Rolf Nevanlinna and the philosopher Eino Kaila (Kajantie, 1997;
Laurikainen, 1982) both who with a deep interest in theoretical physics.
In 1947 Nevanlinna arranged for a scholarship enabling Laurikainen to
study in Z¨urich where he for the ﬁrst time met Wolfgang Pauli whose
writings would later become one the chief sources for Laurikainen’s
philosophical inspiration. Under the guidance of prof Torsten Gustafson
(Lund, Sweden) Laurikainen completed a thesis in 1950 on the gravi-
tational energy of electromagnetic ﬁelds. Lamek Hulth´en then got him
interested in the problem of the deuteron which lead him to become an
expert in computational physics. Back in Finland, ﬁrst as a teacher and
professor in Turku, then in Helsinki (1960-79), he became one of the
main champions, in company with Nevanlinna and prof Karl-Gustav
Fogel (˚Abo Akademi, Turku), of theoretical physics as a ﬁeld within
physics. At that time physics in Finland was predominantly experimen-
tal. In 1961 it became possible to major in theoretical physics. The
Research Institute for Theoretical Physics started in 1964 and it got its
own building in 1969 called the ”Laurikainen building”. Besides launch-
ing computational physics Laurikainen also played an instrumental role
in getting Finland involved in particle physics and later to become a
member of CERN. Thus many physicists have felt a great obligation
toward Laurikainen for his contribution to the postwar reconstruction
of physics research in Finland. When Laurikainen retired he embarked
on equally vigorous projects centered on the study of Wolfgang Pauli’s
philosophical writings (Laurikainen, 1988, 1997a; Ketvel et al., 1996).
In fact, he was scheduled to defend his thesis (Laurikainen, 1997b)
in philosophy on 22. August 1997, when he died a month before

5After the 1977 conference Pekka Lahti suggested to Laurikainen the idea of a
conference devoted especially to the foundations of quantum mechanics to which
Laurikainen responded enthusiastically. While Laurikainen pulled the strings, Lahti
was mainly responsible for the scientiﬁc programmes for the 1985, 1987, and 1989
SFMP-conferences in Joensuu. Due to diverging scientiﬁc interests in the early 90’s,
Lahti, together with P Mittelstaedt and P Busch organized separate conferences
in Cologne (Busch et al., 1993), while Laurikainen and Claus Montonen arranged
In a sense the impetus for the SFMP-conferences can be
symposia in Helsinki.
traced back to Rolf Nevanlinna whose lectures 1946-7 on quantum mechanics had
instilled Laurkainen with a permanent interest in the foundational issues of quantum
mechanics. ”Personally I would say, that this lecture series [on QM], besides the
introductory courses by Kalle Huhtala, was the most rewarding lectures in physics
which I have ever experienced in Finland” (Laurikainen, 1982).

(13.7). While Laurikainen’s philosophical project attracted little sup-
port among his colleagues and former students, Laurikainen was able to
help arrange a successful series of international conferences in Finland
on the foundations of physics. These symposia, centered on the foun-
dational question of quantum mechanics, were right on the target at
that time. Interpretational issues were again coming to the forefront
of physics, one reason being the improved experimental methods for
probing questions such as entanglement. It was also becoming possi-
ble to mention ”philosophy” and ”metaphysics” at physics conferences
without being immediately labeled a crackpot. The symposia also suc-
ceeded in assembling an older generation of physicists who had had a
direct interaction with the ”founders” such as Heisenberg and Bohr.
As a student I think I was quite fortunate in having this opportunity,
via the conferences, to follow the discussions by many great physicists
from around the world.
I remember names (in no particular order)
such as K Bleuler, C F v Weizs¨acker, Y Neeman, J P Vigier, D Bohm,
A Zeilinger, H Stapp, R B Griﬃths, S Kochen, C Piron, P Busch, P
Mittelstaedt, P Lahti, M Jammer, N Rosen, A Aspect ...
to name
only a few. Again the legacy of Laurikainen was that he created a
framework where people could meet and discuss new and old ideas and
ﬁndings. Despite the fact that he hardly ever got a wholehearted sup-
port for his philosophical views, and was sometimes severely criticized,
he remained polite and supportive toward everyone interested in dis-
cussing the issues. Laurikainen remained faithful to the ”Copenhagen
interpretation” but criticized Bohr for having avoided the ontological
questions.

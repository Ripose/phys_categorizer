Each of electrically charged particles testiﬁes in favor of the existence of a
kind of the magnetically charged monoparticle. As a consequence, only the
corresponding mononeutrinos answer for quantization of the electric charges
of all the neutrinos. Therefore, to understand the nature of matter at the fun-
damental level one must use the electromagnetic ﬁeld as the ﬁeld of the uniﬁed
system of the photon and monophoton where the electric and magnetic forces
of the nature are united. Some logical and laboratory conﬁrmations of the
availability of compound structure of gauge invariance have been listed which
say also about the connection between the states of elementary particles and
monoparticles.

A study of the behavior of electrons and their neutrinos in a nucleus
Coulomb ﬁeld shows clearly that between the mass of a particle and its charge
there exists a sharp dependence [1]. For the light Dirac neutrino (ν = νe) it
has the form [2]

Here mE

ν and eE

ν are the neutrino electric rest mass and charge.
Such an intimate connection saying about the gravitational structure of
a Coulomb interaction and reﬂects the fact that the mass and charge of a
particle correspond to the most diverse form of the same regularity of the
nature of this ﬁeld [2, 3].

On the other hand, it is known that in the framework of the hypothesis of
ﬁeld mass based on the classical theory of an extensive electron [4], a particle
all the mass is purely electric. However, according to such a point of view,
the charge distribution of the neutrino will not be steady.

Our conclusion is that each of existing types of charges come forwards in
the system as the source of a kind of the inertial mass [5]. Herewith all the
mass of the neutrino coincides with its united rest mass mU
ν which includes
in self the electric mE

ν and some other components:

ν , weak mW
ν = mE
mU

ν , strong mS
ν + mW

ν + mS

ν + ....

Such a compound structure giving the possibility to directly look at the
nature of matter is observed as a consequence of the availability of the united
charge eU

ν in neutrino equal to its all the charge [5]:
ν = eE
eU

ν + eW

ν + eS

ν + ...,

where the indices E, W and S correspond to the electric, weak and strong
parts of charge.

Thus, it follows that if the neutrino possesses a Dirac mass then all possible
components of this mass establish the intraneutrino interratio between the
forces of the electric and unelectric nature. Therefore, the charge distribution
of the neutrino must be steady [6].

The purpose of the present article is to elucidate what the above - men-
tioned duality of matter say about structures of electromagnetic ﬁeld, gauge
invariance and charge quantization law.

In the framework of the loop phenomena, the neutrino must be electrically
neutral at the conservation of gauge invariance [7]. It appears that here on

2

But if mE

the basis of (1) one can will decide a question about the equality of the
neutrino electric mass to zero.

ν = 0, the neutrino is strictly Majorana particle [5]. At the same
time the existence of massive Dirac neutrinos is by no means excluded exper-
imentally. Insofar as their neutrality in the loop approximation is concerned,
it reﬂects just a latent regularity of general picture of gauge invariance which
requires the study of the structure of electromagnetic ﬁeld.
At ﬁrst sight it appears that a connection between eE

ν is incompat-
ible with charge quantization. Such a regularity, however, takes place owing
to the magnetic monopoles. It is also known that the standard SU (2)L
U (1)
theory, by itself, does not require [8] that the magnetic monopoles be exist
in the form as was suggested by Dirac [9]. Therefore, from point of view
of a massive four - component neutrino, it should be expected that each of
electrically charged particles testiﬁes in favor of the existence of a kind of
a ¡monoparticle¿ namely a particle having the magnetic mass and charge.
Then it is possible, for example, only the corresponding mononeutrinos are
responsible for quantization of the electric charges of all the neutrinos.

ν and mE

There exists a range of other phenomena, in which a fundamental part
is said of monoparticles. One of such systems may serve as the source of
electromagnetic ﬁeld. But unlike earlier known, it must not be usual gauge
boson. The point is that the same photon does not lead to the appearance
of electromagnetic ﬁeld. It possesses the electric mass [10] and charge [11].

From point of view of a Dirac neutrino, this gauge state will indicate
to the existence of the monophoton with the magnetic mass and charge.
In other words, the photon γE and monophoton γH must be source of the
electric ~E and magnetic ~H ﬁelds respectively. Under shuch circumstances
the electromagnetic ﬁeld ( ~E, ~H) appears as the ﬁeld of the uniﬁed system of
the photon and monophoton (γE, γH) where the electric ~FE and magnetic ~FH
forces of the nature are united.

To elucidate the compound structure of its gauge invariance one must
apply once more to the question whether the same particle has simultaneously
both electric and magnetic charges. There exist, however, many uncertainties
both in the nature and in the behavior of these types of charges. Nevertheless,
if we assume [12] that the possibility of the existence of such Dirac fermions
is not excluded, the neutrino interaction with an electromagnetic ﬁeld of
emission arises at the expense of exchange simultaneously both by the photon
and by the monophoton. The latter would lead us to the implication that

3

the invariance of these types of gauge bosons concerning C, P and T, and
also their combinations CP and CPT are not diﬀerent.

Finally, insofar as the appearance of magnetic ﬁeld in usual laboratory
conditions is concerned, to this one must apply as to one of the available
experimental data conﬁrming the existence of monoparticles and saying that
any electrically charged particle can be converted into the corresponding
monoparticle and vice versa. Of course, these transitions and many other
aspects of compound structure of each of existing types of charges and masses
open of principle possibilities for creation at the fundamental level of truly
physical theories of naturally united gauge ﬁelds.

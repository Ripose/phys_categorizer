Abstract

Fundamental problem of cryptography is to create more
absolutely secure bits than the initially shared secret bits
between two legitimate users. It is widely believed that this
task can only be accomplished by quantum cryptosystems.
We present a simple classical cryptosystem, which can fulﬁll
this objective.

Cryptography, the art of secure communication has been developed from the
dawn of human civilization, but it has been mathematically treated by Shan-
non [1]. At present, we have diﬀerent classical cryptosystems whose merits
and demerits are discussed below.

Vernam cipher [2]: It is proven secure [1] but it can not produce more
absolutely secure bits than the shared secret bits. Due to this diﬃculty, it
can not be used for widespread secure communication.

Data encryption standard [3] and public key distribution system [4]:
These are widely used cryptosystems because they can produce more com-
putationally secure bits than the shared secret bits. The problem is that
it’s computational security is not proved. The assumption of computational
security has become extremely weak after the discovery of fast quantum al-
gorithms (see ref. 16)

To solve the above problems of classical cryptosystem, quantum cryp-
tography [5-9] has been developed over the last two decades. Conceptually
quantum cryptography is elegant and many undiscovered possibilities might
store in it. In the last few years work on its security has been remarkably
progressed [10-15], however work is yet not ﬁnished.

On quantum cryptography the most widely used conjectures [16]are:

1. Completely quantum channel based cryptosystem is impossible (existing
quantum cryptosystem requires classical channel to operate). 2. Uncon-
ditionally secure quantum bit commitment is impossible. 3. By classical
means, it is impossible to create more absolutely secure bits than the shared
secret bits.

Recently alternative quantum cryptosystem has been developed [17-21]
by the present author; which can operate solely on quantum channel (both
entangled and unentangled type) and can provide unconditionally secure
quantum bit commitment. The same coding and decoding technique has
also been applied for classical cryptosystem incorporating noise [18]. In that
paper [18], we cast doubt on the third conjecture. But the problem of our

2

noise based classical cryptosystem is that it is slow and complex. Here we
present a fast and extremely simple system without using noise. Only we
need the concept of ”pseudo-bits” introduced in that paper.

Operational procedure: Always in the string of random bits, there are
real and pseudo-bits. Real bits contain the message and pseudo-bits are to
mislead eavesdropper. Sender encodes the sequence of real bits on to the
ﬁxed real bit positions and encodes the sequence of pseudo-bits on to the
ﬁxed pseudo-bit positions. It thus forms the entire string which is transmit-
ted. The ﬁxed positions of real and pseudo-bits are initially secretly shared
between sender and receiver. Therefore, receiver can decode the real bits
from real bit positions. Obviously he/she ignores the pseudo-bits.

For the second message, sender uses new sequences of real and pseudo-
bits but the position of real and pseudo-bits are same. So again receiver
decodes the message from the same real bit positions. In this way inﬁnite
number of messages can be coded and decoded. Notice that initially shared
secret positions of real and pseudo-bits are repeatedly used. That’s why, in
some sense, secrecy is being ampliﬁed. Let us illustrate the procedure.

In the above block, the ﬁrst row represents the sequence ”S”, which is
initially secretly shared. In that sequence, ”R” and ”P” denote the position
of real and pseudo- bits respectively The next rows represent the encoded
sequences for the messages sequence : M1, M2, M3, M4, ...., Mn. In these en-
coded sequences bi are the real bits - 1s and 0s for i-th message. Obviously

the sequences of real bits change from message to message. Similarly pseudo-
bits are also changing from message to message. Only position of real and
pseudo-bits are unchanged.

Condition for absolute security: Shannon’s condition for absolute security
[1] is that the probability of getting the message from cipher-text is same
with the probability of getting the message without cipher-text. That is,
eavesdropper has to guess for absolutely secure system. In our system, for a
particular sequence of events (bits), if the probability of real events (prealbits)
becomes equal to the probability of pseudo-events (ppseudo−bits) then eaves-
dropper has to guess. As all the sequences are independent so eavesdropper
has to guess for all sequences. Therefore, condition for absolute security can
be written as: 1.ppseudo−bits ≥ prealbits. 2.p1 = p0, the probability of 1s and 0s
are same. 3. All encoded sequences should be statistically independent.

Speed of communication: If we take ppseudo−bits = prealbits and share 100
bits, then we could communicate with half of the speed of digital communi-
cation as long as we wish. Perhaps no cryptosystems oﬀer such speed.

Though this is an extremely simple cryptosystem but it was undiscovered
since cryptographic power of pseudo-bits was not realized before. It should be
mentioned that the system is purely classical and can not be used to achieve
other quantum cryptographic tasks such as cheating free Bell’s inequality test
[19] and quantum bit commitment encoding [20]. Entire area of quantum
cryptography can not be encroached by classical cryptography.

ON THE ORIGIN OF THE NOTION OF GW
ET CETERA

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. The notion of gravitational wave (GW) came forth origi-
nally as a by-product of the linear approximation of general relativity
(GR). Now, it can be proved that this approximation is quite inade-
quate to a proper study of the hypothetic GW’s. The signiﬁcant role
of the approximations beyond the linear stage is emphasized.

1. - As it is well known, the linear approximation of GR (physically, the
approximation for weak gravitational ﬁelds) has Minkowski spacetime as its
(ﬁxed) substrate [1], [2]. It resembles the e.m. Maxwell theory, and is only
Lorentz invariant.

With respect to transformations of general co-ordinates, its energy tensor
becomes a false (pseudo) tensor, which can be reduced to zero through a
suitable change of reference system.

A celebrated by-product of the linearized version of GR is the notion of
gravitational wave [1], [2]. Now, in 1944 Weyl [3] pointed out that, rigo-
rously speaking, the gravitational ﬁeld of the linearized version exerts no
force on matter, i.e. is a “powerless shadow”. Indeed, a basic result of the
Einstein-Infeld-Hoﬀmann method [4] tells us that, as Weyl [3] wrote, “the
gravitational force arises only when one continues the approximation be-
yond the linear stage.” Even in the modern literature this fact is generally
overlooked and, quite uncritically, the action on matter of a gravitational
wave – e.g. of a plane wave – is formally computed.

In conclusion,the linear approximation of GR – which is the favourite
relativistic doctrine of the GW hunters – is completely inadequate to an
approximate treatment of the question of the GW’s.

On the other hand, if we continue the approximation beyond the linear
stage (cf. [4] and [5]), we ﬁnd that the radiation terms of the gravitational
ﬁeld can be destroyed by convenient co-ordinate transformations: this proves
that the GW’s are only a product of a special choice of the reference frame,
i.e. that they do not possess a physical reality [6], [7].

In the recent literature the above crucial role of the co-ordinate system
is ignored. E.g., Itoh and Futamase have published a learned study on the
third post-Newtonian equation of motion for relativistic compact binaries
[8], [9]; their result is derived under the harmonic co-ordinate condition.

Motivation for this research [8]: “One promising source of gravitational
waves for those detectors [i.e. GEO600, LIGO, TAMA300] is a relativistic
compact binary system in an inspiraling phase. The detectability and qual-
ity of measurements of astrophysical information of such gravitational wave
sources rely on the accuracy of our theoretical knowledge about the wave-
forms. A high order, say, third- or fourth-order, post-Newtonian equation of
motion for an inspiraling compact binary is one of the necessary ingredients
to construct and study such waveforms [. . .].” Itoh writes (see the abstract
of [9]): “Our resulting equation of motion admits a conserved energy (ne-
glecting the 2.5 PN radiation reaction eﬀect), is Lorentz invariant, and is
unambiguous [. . .].”

These authors do not suspect that the radiation terms are frame de-
pendent, and can be destroyed by a suitable change of co-ordinate system.
Further, they are unaware that – as it is easy to prove – the motions of point
masses interacting only gravitationally – as, e.g., the two compact stars of
some binaries or the bodies of the solar system – happen along geodesic
lines [6], and consequently an emission of GW’s is obviously impossible.

More radically, it can be proved that no “mechanism” exists in GR for

the generation of GW’s [6].

- Only recently, through a kind letter of Prof. A. Gsponer, I have

known the existence of the beautiful memoir by Weyl [3].

Since it seems that the astrophysical community is not aware of Weyl’s
results, I think very useful to reproduce in an APPENDIX, at the end
of the present paper, the “Introduction and Summary” and sects. 1, 2 of
Weyl’s memoir, which are particularly relevant to our theme.

I avail myself of this opportunity for an apology:

in 1999 I published a
very short Note entitled “Deduction of the law of motion of the charges from
Maxwell equations” [10]. Now, my result is contained in Weyl’s treatment
of Maxwell theory, see sect. 2. of [3]. Weyl wrote that this theorem was
“well known”. Yes, but only to the Blessed Few!

Acknowledgment. - I am very grateful to Prof. G. Morpurgo, who has

called my attention to the research of Itoh and Futamase [8], [9].

HOW FAR CAN ONE GET WITH A LINEAR FIELD THEORY OF
GRAVITATION IN FLAT SPACE-TIME?1

By HERMANN WEYL
(from: Amer. J. Math. 66 (1944) 591)

Introduction and Summary. G.D. Birkhoﬀ’s attempt to establish a linear
ﬁeld theory of gravitation within the frame of special relativity2 makes it desir-
able to probe the potentialities and limitations of such a theory in more general
In thus continuing a discussion begun at another place3 I ﬁnd that the
terms.
diﬀerential operators at one’s disposal form a 5 dimensional linear manifold. But
the requirement that the ﬁeld equations imply the law of conservation of energy
i /∂xk = 0 limit these ∞5 possibilities to ∞2,
and momentum in the simple form ∂T k
which, however, reduce easily to two cases, a regular one (L) and a singular one (L′).
The regular case (L) is nothing but Einstein’s theory of weak ﬁelds. Resembling
very closely Maxwell’s theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, it satisﬁes a principle
of gauge invariance involving 4 arbitrary functions, and although its gravitational
ﬁeld exerts no force on matter, it is well suited to illustrate the role of energy and
momentum, charge and mass in the interplay between matter and ﬁeld. It might

also help, though this is much more problematic, in pointing the way to a more
satisfactory uniﬁcation of gravitation and electricity than we at present possess.
Birkhoﬀ follows the opposite way: by avoiding rather than adopting the ∞2 special
operators mentioned above, his “dualistic” theory (B) destroys the bond between
mechanical and ﬁeld equations, which is such a decisive feature in Einstein’s theory.

linear theory of gravitation (L). Gauge invariance. Within the frame of
special relativity and its metric ground form

fik = ∂φk/∂xi − ∂φi/∂xk

∂f ki/∂xk = si

or

′
Diφ = (cid:3)φi − ∂φ

/∂xi = si

where si is the density-ﬂow of electric charge and

′
φ

= ∂φi/∂xi,

(cid:3)φ = δpq(∂2φ/∂xp∂xq).

The equations do not change if one substitutes

∗
i = φi − ∂λ/∂xi
φ

for φi,

λ being an arbitrary function of the co¨ordinates (“gauge invariance”), and they

imply the diﬀerential conservation law of electric charge:

∂si/∂xi = 0.

As is easily veriﬁed, there are only two ways in which one may form a vector ﬁeld
by linear combination of the second derivatives of a given vector ﬁeld φi, namely,

(cid:3)φi

i/∂xi
and ∂φ

i = ∂φp/∂xp).

The only linear combination Diφ of these two vector ﬁelds which satisﬁes the

identity (∂/∂xi)(Diφ) = 0 is the one occurring in (1),

/∂xi.

Diφ = (cid:3)φi − ∂φ
Herein lies as sort of mathematical justiﬁcation for Maxwell’s equations.
Taking from Einstein’s theory of gravitation the hint that gravitation is repre-
sented by a symmetric tensor potential hik, but trying to emulate the linear char-
acter of Maxwell’s theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, one could ask oneself what
symmetric tensors ¯Dikh can be constructed by linear combination from the second
derivatives of hik. The answer is that there are 5 such expressions, namely

(4)

(cid:3)hik,

∂h

i/∂xk + ∂h

δik,

where

5

With any linear combination ¯Dikh of these 5 expressions one could set up the

ﬁeld equations of gravitation

(5)

¯Dikh = Tik

the right member of which is the energy-momentum tensor Tik. In analogy to
the situation encountered in Maxwell’s theory one may ask further for which linear
combinations ¯Dik the identity

will hold, and one ﬁnds that this is the case if, and only if, ¯Dikh is of the form

(∂/∂xk)( ¯Dk

i h) = 0

δik} + β{∂2h/∂xi∂xk − (cid:3)h · δik}.

α and β being arbitrary constants. In this case the ﬁeld equations (5) entail the

diﬀerential conservation law of energy and momentum

(7)

∂T k

i /∂xk = 0.

With two constants a, b, (a 6= 0, a 6= 4b) we can make the substitution

and thereby reduce α, β to the values 1, 1, provided α 6= 0, α 6= 2β. Hence,

disregarding these singular values, we may assume as our ﬁeld equations

hik → a · hik − b · hδik

(8) Dikh ≡ {(cid:3)hik −(∂h

′
i/∂xk +∂h

′
k/∂xi)+h

′′

δik}+{∂2h/∂xi∂xk −(cid:3)h·δik} = Tik.

Dikh remains unchanged if hik is replaced by

(9)

∗
ik = hik + (∂ξi/∂xk + ∂ξk/∂xi)

h

where ξi is an arbitrary vector ﬁeld. Hence we have the same type of correlation
between gauge invariance and conservation law for the gravitational ﬁeld as for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, and it is reasonable to consider as physically equivalent any
two tensor ﬁelds h, h∗ which are related by (9).

The linear theory of gravitation (L) in a ﬂat world at which one thus arrives
with a certain mathematical necessity is nothing else but Einstein’s theory for weak
ﬁelds. Indeed, on replacing Einstein’s gik by δik + 2κ · hik and neglecting higher
powers of the gravitational constant κ, one obtains (8), and the property of gauge
invariance (9) reﬂects the invariance of Einstein’s equations with respect to arbi-
trary co¨ordinate transformations4.

By proper normalization of the arbitrary function λ in (2) one may impose the
condition φ′ = 0 upon the φi, thus giving Maxwell’s equations a form often used
by H. A. Lorentz:

(cid:3)φi = si,

∂φi/∂xi = 0.

In the same manner one can choose the ξi in (9) so that γik = hik − 1

2 h · δik

satisﬁes the equations

In one important respect gauge invariance works diﬀerently for electromagnetic
and gravitational ﬁelds: If one splits the tensor of derivatives φk,i = ∂φk/∂xi into
a skew and a symmetric part,

φk,i =

(φk,i − φi,k) +

(φk,i + φi,k),

2

the ﬁrst part is not aﬀected by a gauge transformation whereas the second can
locally be transformed into zero. In the gravitational case all derivatives ∂hik/∂xp
can locally be transformed into zero. Hence we may construct, according to Faraday
and Maxwell, an energy-momentum tensor Lik of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,

but no tensor Gik depending quadratically on the derivatives ∂hik/∂xp exists, if

gauge invariance is required, other than the trivial Gik ≡ 0.

fik = φk,i − φi,k,

2. Particles as centers of force, and the charge vector and energy-
momentum tensor of a continuous cloud of substance. Conceiving a resting
particle as a center of force, let us determine the static centrally symmetric solutions
of our homogeneous ﬁeld equations (1) and (5) (si = 0, Tik = 0). One easily
veriﬁes that in the sense of equivalence the most general such solution is given by
the equations

φ0 = e/4πr,

φi = 0

for i 6= 0;

γ00 = m/4πr,

γik = 0 for (i, k) 6= (0, 0);

r being the distance from the center. As was to be hoped, it involves but two
constants, charge e and mass m. The center itself appears as a singularity in the
ﬁeld. Indeed φ0 and the factor φ in φxa [α = 1, 2, 3] must be functions of r alone,
and the relations

△φ0 = 0,

∂φa/∂xa = 0

[α = 1, 2, 3]

implied in (10) then yield

φ0 = a/r,

φ = b/r

3

,

φa = −(∂/∂xa)(b/r).

Substitution of φa − ∂λ/∂xa for φa with λ = −b/r changes φa into zero. In the

same manner (15) is obtained from the equations (11 & 12).

A continuous cloud of “charged dust” can be characterized by its velocity ﬁeld
ui (uiui = 1) and the rest densities µ, ρ of mass and charge. It is well known that
its equations of motion and the diﬀerential conservation laws of mass and charge
result if one sets si = ρui in Maxwell’s equations and lets T k
in (7) consist of the
i
Faraday-Maxwell ﬁeld part (13) and the kinetic part µuiuk:

∂(ρui)/∂xi = 0,

∂(µui)/∂xi = 0;

µdui/ds = ρ · fipup.

7

Since the motion of the individual dust particle is determined by dxi/ds = ui
we have written d/ds for uk∂/∂xk. In this manner Faraday explained by his elec-
tromagnetic tensions (ﬂow of momentum) the fact that the active charge which
generates an electric ﬁeld is at the same time the passive charge on which a given
ﬁeld acts. At its present stage our theory (L) accounts for the force which an elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld exerts upon matter, but the gravitational ﬁeld remains a powerless
shadow. From the standpoint of Einstein’s theory this is at it should be, because
the gravitational force arises only when one continues the approximation beyond the
linear stage. We pointed out above that no remedy for this defect may be found in
a gauge invariant gravitational energy-momentum tensor. However, the theory (L)
explains why active gravity, represented by the scalar factor µ in the kinetic term
µuiuk as it appears in the right member Tik of the gravitational equations (5), is
at the same time inertial mass: this is simply another expression of the fact that
the mechanical equations (7) are a consequence of those ﬁeld equation.

We have seen that even in empty space the ﬁeld part of energy and momentum
must not be ignored, and thus a particle should be described by the static centrally
symmetric solution of the equations

(16)

Diφ = 0,

Dikh − Lik = 0

(of which the second set is no longer strictly linear!). Again we ﬁnd, after proper

gauge normalization,

(17)

and then

φ0 = e/4πr,

φ1 = φ2 = φ3 = 0,

γ00 = m/4πr − 1/4(e/4πr)2,
γαβ = −(e/4πr)2 · (xαxβ/4r2)

(cid:26)

γ0a = 0,

[α, β = 1, 2, 3].

As before, two characteristic constants e and m appear. At distance much larger
than the “radius” e2/4πm of the particle the gravitational inﬂuence of charge be-
comes negligible compared with that of mass.

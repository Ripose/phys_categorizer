Abstract

The Gravity Probe B (GP-B) satellite experiment will measure the precession of
on-board gyroscopes to extraordinary accuracy. Such precessions are predicted by
General Relativity (GR), and one component of this precession is the ‘frame-dragging’
or Lense-Thirring eﬀect, which is caused by the rotation of the earth, and the other
is the geodetic eﬀect. A new theory of gravity predicts, however, a second and much
larger ‘frame-dragging’ or vorticity induced spin precession. This spin precession
component will also display the eﬀects of novel gravitational waves which are predicted
by the new theory of gravity, and which have already been seen in several experiments.
The magnitude and signature of these gravitational wave induced spin precession
eﬀects is given for comparison with the GP-B experimental data.

The Stanford University-NASA Gravity Probe B satellite experiment has the capacity
to measure the precession of four on-board gyroscopes to unprecedented accuracy
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The experiment was proposed independently by George Pugh in 1959
and Leonard Schiﬀ in 1960. Such a precession is predicted by the Einstein theory of
gravity, General Relativity (GR), with two components: (i) a geodetic precession, and
(ii) a ‘frame-dragging’ precession known as the Lense-Thirring eﬀect. The latter is a
particularly interesting eﬀect induced by the rotation of the earth, and described in
GR in terms of a ‘gravitomagnetic’ ﬁeld. According to GR this smaller eﬀect will give
a precession perpendicular to the plane of the satellite orbit accumulating to 0.042
arcsec per year for the GP-B gyroscopes. However a recently developed theory gives
a diﬀerent account of gravity [6, 11]. This theory gives a dynamical account of the so-
called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies. It also successfully predicts the masses of
the black holes found in the globular clusters M15 and G1. Here we show that GR and
the new theory make very diﬀerent predictions for the ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect, and so
the GP-B experiment will be able to decisively test both theories. While predicting
the same earth-rotation induced precession, the new theory has an additional much
larger ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect caused by the observed translational motion of the earth,
and in a diﬀerent direction to the earth induced rotation induced precession. As well
the new non-metric theory explains the ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect in terms of vorticity in
a ‘substratum ﬂow’. This ‘ﬂow’ exhibits ﬂuctuations or wave eﬀects that have already
been seen in at least three experiments. These are the gravitational waves of the new
theory of gravity, and are completely diﬀerent from the gravitational waves predicted
by General Relativity. Herein the magnitude and signature of this new component of

2

the gyroscope precession is predicted, with particular emphasis on the gravitational
wave eﬀects, which it is predicted will be detectable by the GP-B experiment.

2 Aspects of the History of Gravity Research

The history of the development of theories of gravity is well known. Newton intro-
duced the gravitational acceleration ﬁeld g(r, t), whose source was matter, as shown
in (2), and which was then used by Newton to explain the solar system planetary
dynamics as had been expressed by Kepler in his laws. In terms of this acceleration
ﬁeld Newton’s ‘universal law of gravitation’, in (1), is uniquely determined by Kepler’s
laws. However the phenomena of gravity may be equally well represented in terms
of a ‘ﬂow’ system involving a velocity vector ﬁeld v(r, t), and this formalism is phys-
ically indistinguishable from the Newtonian formalism, in terms of the consequent
gravitational forces in the solar system, though it is clearly diﬀerent mathematically.
However, unlike the Newtonian formalism, this velocity ﬁeld formalism permits an
additional dynamical eﬀect that would not have manifested in the case of the solar
system, that is, it is not inconsistent with Kepler’s laws. It is now known that this
additional dynamical eﬀect is nothing more than the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect
[6]. So we now understand that had Newton used the velocity ﬁeld instead of the
acceleration ﬁeld as the fundamental degrees of freedom then the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect
could have been predicted by Newton long ago.

There was another ‘accident of history’ that has enormously inﬂuenced the devel-
opment of physics, and in particular that of gravity, namely the detection of absolute
motion. In this case Michelson and Morley in their interferometer experiment of 1887
detected the expected fringe shifts caused by absolute motion, but using Newtonian
physics Michelson had developed a theory for the instrument which predicted fringe
shifts larger than actually observed. This supposed failure to detect the expected
fringe shifts and so absolute motion led to the notion that absolute motion, that is,
motion measured with respect to local space itself, is not even a meaningful concept,
despite that over the last 114 years it has been detected in at least seven experiments,
and of several kinds. Re-analysing the operation of the Michelson interferometer by
taking account, for the ﬁrst time, of both the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect and
the eﬀect of a gas being present in the light path, we now know that the Michelson-
Morley experiment gives a lower limit of some 300 km/s for the speed of absolute
motion of the earth through space1, rather than the 8 km/s which follows from the
Newtonian theory and which they reported in 1887. The existence of absolute motion
and of the gravitational eﬀects associated with that ‘ﬂow’ have gone unstudied for
the last 100 years, and the ‘dark-matter’ eﬀect is only one of numerous gravitational
phenomena that have been observed but remain as unexplained - these phenomena
are known as ‘gravitational anomalies’. It always needs to be emphasised that abso-
lute motion is the cause of the various relativistic eﬀects, an idea that goes back to
Lorentz in the 19th century.

1A lower limit arises because of the projection eﬀect occurring in interferometers.

3

In 1916 Hilbert and Einstein proposed a metric spacetime theory of gravity, which
was constructed to agree with the Newtonian acceleration ﬁeld formalism in the so-
called non-relativistic limit. But in doing so Hilbert and Einstein consequently missed
the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, as that eﬀect had been missed also by Newton. As well
this theory also missed the existence of absolute motion, an eﬀect absolutely critical
to understanding gravity. It has been repeatedly claimed that the Hilbert-Einstein
General Theory of Relativity has been conﬁrmed many times, but this is untrue. All
but one of the so-called tests merely used the geodesic equation which determines the
trajectory of a particle or an electromagnetic wave in a given metric. That metric
has in all cases been the external Schwarzschild metric, but apparently unknown to
most is that this metric is nothing more than the Newtonian ‘inverse square law’ in
mathematical disguise, namely with the metric expressed in terms of the particular
velocity vector ﬂow ﬁeld corresponding to Newton’s inverse square law. So these
tests of GR were conﬁrming, at best, the ﬂow formalism for gravity, together with its
geodesic equation, and had nothing to do with the dynamical content of GR. Indeed
the one single test, so far, of GR is the observed decay rate of the binary pulsar orbits.
As well, as already noted, GR has failed in the case of the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect.

The Gravity Probe B experiment will test the dynamics of GR and of the new
theory, and the diﬀerences between the two predictions are very diﬀerent. Because
of the denial of absolute linear motion in GR it predicts only a ‘frame-dragging’
eﬀect produced by the absolute rotation of the earth, whereas the new theory of
gravity predicts not only that eﬀect, but most signiﬁcantly and dominantly, a ‘frame-
dragging’ eﬀect caused by the absolute linear motion of the earth. In the new theory,
because it is not a metric spacetime theory, the ‘spacetime frame-dragging’ is seen to
be a vorticity in the ﬂow of space caused by the absolute motion of the earth, both
rotational and linear, through that space. As well that ﬂow has wave phenomena
which can be detected via their eﬀect on the vorticity. The vorticity of the ﬂow, which
is simply a local rotation of the direction of the ﬂow, aﬀects the GP-B gyroscopes, and
anything else, by simply rotating the whole system. So the gyroscope spin precessions
can detect these gravitational waves.

As well the ‘dark matter’ dynamical eﬀect has its magnitude determined by a new
dimensionless gravitational constant, in addition to the Newtonian constant G. By
comparing the new theory with the experimental data from the Greenland borehole
g anomaly data, it was found that the new gravitational constant is the ﬁne structure
constant α ≈ 1/137. This has enormous implications for fundamental physics, as
discussed elsewhere [6], but in particular the new theory predicts black holes whose
dynamics is determined by the value of α, and not by G. This result has been
conﬁrmed by the black holes observed in several globular clusters. The ‘dark matter’
eﬀect is also apparent in Cavendish-type experiments that measure G, and there has
been a longstanding unknown systematic eﬀect present in these experiments that has
caused G to be the least accurately known fundamental constant [6].

3 A Theory of Gravity

Here we brieﬂy review the derivation of the new theory of gravity [6, 11]. The New-
tonian ‘inverse square law’ for gravity,

F =

Gm1m2
r2

,

∇.g = −4πGρ,

was based on Kepler’s laws for the motion of the planets. Newton’s ‘explanation’ of
the phenomena of gravity was in terms of the gravitational acceleration vector ﬁeld
g(r, t), and in diﬀerential form

where ρ(r, t) is the matter density. However there is an alternative formulation [6] in
terms of a vector ‘ﬂow’ ﬁeld v(r, t) determined by

∂
∂t

(∇.v) + ∇.((v.∇)v) = −4πGρ,

with g now given by the Euler ‘ﬂuid’ acceleration

Trivially this g also satisﬁes (2). External to a spherical mass M of radius R a velocity
ﬁeld solution of (3) is

which gives from (4) the usual inverse square law g ﬁeld

However the ﬂow equation (3) is not uniquely determined by Kepler’s laws because

also has the same external solution (5), because C(v) = 0 for the ﬂow in (5). So
the presence of the C(v) would not have manifested in the special case of planets
in orbit about the massive central sun. Here α is a dimensionless constant - a new

gravitational constant, in addition to usual the Newtonian gravitational constant G.
However inside a spherical mass we ﬁnd [6] that C(v) 6= 0, and using the Greenland
borehole g anomaly data [8] we ﬁnd that α−1 = 139 ± 5, which gives the ﬁne structure
constant α = e2¯h/c ≈ 1/137 to within experimental error. From (4) we can write

where

∇.g = −4πGρ − 4πGρDM ,

(11)

which introduces an eﬀective ‘matter density’ representing the ﬂow dynamics associ-
ated with the C(v) term. In [6] this dynamical eﬀect is shown to be the ‘dark matter’
eﬀect. The interpretation of the vector ﬂow ﬁeld v is that it is a manifestation, at
the classical level, of a quantum substratum to space; the ﬂow is a rearrangement
of that substratum, and not a ﬂow through space. However (7) needs to be further
generalised [6] to include vorticity, and also the eﬀect of the motion of matter through
this substratum via

vR(r0(t), t) = v0(t) − v(r0(t), t),

(12)

where v0(t) is the velocity of an object, at r0(t), relative to the same frame of reference
that deﬁnes the ﬂow ﬁeld; then vR is the velocity of that matter relative to the
substratum. The ﬂow equation (7) is then generalised to, with d/dt = ∂/∂t + v.∇

The GP-B experiment will detect this vorticity ﬁeld by means of the spin-axis
rotation or precession of the gyroscopes over time, with the magnitude and direction
of this rotation or precession measured relative to the direction of the guide star
as observed by the on-board telescope. Clearly any wave phenomena that changes
vR(r, t) in (16) will also be detected via its eﬀect on ~ω(r, t).

4 Geodesics

We now deﬁne how the trajectory of a point object is determined by the velocity ﬂow
ﬁeld, which manifests via the velocity of absolute motion of the object relative to
the local space, namely via vR. There is a problem with terminology here: what is
called absolute motion here is actually motion with respect to the local substratum
structure of space, which means that it is a relative motion. However in the language
and restrictions of conventional ‘special relativity’ all velocities are relative, where in
this case it means relative to another object and not relative to space itself. Most
signiﬁcantly the geodesic equation herein involves both (absolute) motion with respect
to space and also the relativistic time dilation eﬀect. This latter eﬀect involves the
notion that absolute motion, whether linear or rotational, causes, say, a clock moving
through space to tick more slowly than one at rest in space. Similarly in the re-
analysis of the principles of operation of the Michelson interferometer it was necessary
to take account of both absolute linear motion and the relativistic length contraction
eﬀect upon the arms of the interferometer caused by that absolute linear motion. So
again to observe absolute motion we must take account of those relativistic eﬀects
which are actually caused by absolute motion. This is contrary to the postulate by
Einstein which asserts that absolute motion has no meaning and so no experimental
manifestation. The GP-B experiment will, yet again, show that this key postulate is
invalid, but which does not invalidate the phenomena known as ‘special relativistic’
eﬀects.
In terms of the history of physics it implies that we must return to the
pre-Einstein ideas of Lorentz and others.

The path r0(t) of an object through space is obtained by extremising the rela-

tivistic proper time

This entails the idea that the speed of light c is the maximum speed through the local
space. This means that the speed of light is c only with respect to the local space. That
it is believed that c is the speed of light for all observers in uniform linear motion,
as postulated by Einstein, is an error that follows from not realising that when in
motion the observer’s clock and rod are aﬀected by that motion. Without correcting
for such absolute motion eﬀects the incorrect notion of c being the ‘universal speed
of light’ is not realised.

To extremise τ we use a small deformation of the trajectory

r0(t) → r0(t) + δr0(t) giving v0(t) → v0(t) +

This is a generalisation of the acceleration in (4) to include the vorticity eﬀect, as the
last term, and the ﬁrst term which is the resistance to acceleration caused by the rel-
ativistic ‘mass’ increase eﬀect. This term leads to the so-called geodetic eﬀects. The
vorticity term causes the GP-B gyroscopes to develop the vorticity induced precession
[7], which is simply the rotation of space carrying the gyroscope along with it, com-
pared to more distant space which is not involved in that rotation. The middle term,

8

namely the acceleration in (4), is simply the usual Newtonian gravitational acceler-
ation, but now seen to arise from the inhomogeneity and time-variation of the ﬂow
velocity ﬁeld. As already noted it was this geodesic equation that has been checked in
various experiments, but always, except in the case of the binary pulsar slow-down,
with the velocity ﬁeld given by the Newtonian ‘inverse square law’ equivalent form
in (5). As discussed elsewhere [6, 11] this ﬂow is exactly equivalent to the external
Schwarzschild metric.

5 Gravitational Waves

Newtonian gravity in its original ‘force’ formalism (2) does not admit any wave phe-
nomena. However the ‘in-ﬂow’ formalism (13)-(14) does admit wave phenomena. For
the simpler case here of very small vorticity and no motion of matter eﬀects, namely
v2
R ≪ c2 on the RHS of (13), (13)-(14) reduce to (3). This is seen by writing v = ∇u,
where u is the velocity potential, which is valid when ∇ × v = 0. Here we shall also
neglect the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect. Then in terms of u(r, t) (3) becomes

Equations (25) and (26) together exactly reproduce (2), even when the ﬂow is time-
dependent, and whether or not the matter density is time dependent. We note that
the ‘inverse square law’, in the ‘ﬂow’ formalism, follows from the structure of the
LHS of (3), which in turn is determined by the Galilean covariance of the Euler ‘ﬂuid’
derivative [12]. In this regard we note that the Galilean covariance is not at odds
with Lorentz covariance, provided that we understand that they apply to observer
data either after or before correcting the data for the eﬀects of absolute motion upon
the observers instruments [11].

We shall now show that in terms of the velocity ﬁeld formalism non-relativistic
gravity possess a wave phenomena. So again had Newton used this velocity formal-
ism then he could have predicted the existence of such gravitational waves. These
gravitational waves are totally diﬀerent from those predicted by General Relativity,
and unlike these, which have not been observed, the new gravitational waves can now
be understood to have been seen in numerous experiments, as discussed later and in
[9].

Suppose that (25) has for a static matter density a static solution u0(r) with
corresponding velocity ﬁeld v0(r), and with corresponding acceleration g0(r). Then

9

we look for time dependent perturbative solutions of (25) with u = u0 + u. To ﬁrst
order in u we then have

∂u(r, t)
∂t

= −∇u(r, t).∇u0(r),

(28)

This equation is easily seen to have wave solutions of the form u(r, t) = A cos(k.r −
ωt + φ) where ω(k, r) = v0(r).k, for wavelengths short compared to the scale of
changes in v0(r). The phase velocity of these waves is then vφ = v0, and the group
velocity is vg = ∇kω = v0. Then the velocity ﬁeld is

v(r, t) = v0(r) − Ak sin(k.r − w(k, r)t + φ).

(29)

In general we have, perturbatively, the superposition of such waves, giving

v(r, t) = v0(r) −

kA(k)k sin(k.r − w(k, r)t + φ(k)).

(30)

d

Z

The wave part of this expression, it is suggested, describes the wave phenomena shown
in Fig.7. These wave solutions have also been seen in non-perturbative numerical
solutions of (3), and even when the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect is retained as in (7).

But are these wave solutions physical, or are they a mere artifact of the in-ﬂow
formalism? First note that the wave phenomena do not cause any gravitational
eﬀects, in the above approximation, because the acceleration ﬁeld is independent
of their existence; whether they are present or not does not aﬀect g(r). Hence these
gravitational waves produce no force eﬀects via the acceleration ﬁeld deﬁned by (4).
The question is equivalent to asking which of the ﬁelds v or g is the fundamental
quantity. As we have already noted the velocity ﬁeld v and these wave phenomena
have already been observed [9, 10, 11]. Indeed it is even possible that the eﬀects of
such waves are present in the Michelson-Morley 1887 fringe shift data. This would
imply that the real gravitational waves have actually been observed for over 100 years.
Within the full new theory of gravity these waves do aﬀect the acceleration ﬁeld
g, via the dynamical inﬂuence of the new C(v) ‘dark matter’ term, and also via the
goedesic and vorticity terms in (24). There is evidence that the eﬀects of these two
terms have been seen in the experiments by Allais, Saxl and Allen, and by Zhou
[10]. The observational evidence is that these gravitational waves are in the main
associated with gravitational phenomena in the Milky Way and local galactic cluster,
as revealed in the analysis of data from at least three distinct observations of absolute
motion eﬀects [10].

6 Vorticity Eﬀects

Here we consider one diﬀerence between the two theories, namely that associated with
the vorticity part of (24), leading to the ‘frame-dragging’ or Lense-Thirring eﬀect. In
GR the vorticity ﬁeld is known as the ‘gravitomagnetic’ ﬁeld B = −c ~ω.
In both
in
GR and the new theory the vorticity is given by (16) but with a key diﬀerence:

S

VE

Figure 1: Shows the earth (N is up) and vorticity vector ﬁeld component ~ω induced by the
rotation of the earth, as in (31). The polar orbit of the GP-B satellite is shown, S is the
gyroscope starting spin orientation, directed towards the guide star IM Pegasi, RA = 22h 53′
2.26′′, Dec = 160 50′ 28.2′′, and VE is the vernal equinox.

GR vR is only the rotational velocity of the matter in the earth, whereas in (13)-(14)
vR is the vector sum of the rotational velocity and the translational velocity of the
earth through the substratum. At least seven experiments have detected this trans-
lational velocity; some were gas-mode Michelson interferometers and others coaxial
cable experiments [9, 10, 11], and the translational velocity is now known to be ap-
proximately 430 km/s in the direction RA = 5.2h, Dec= −670. This direction has
been known since the Miller [13] gas-mode interferometer experiment, but the RA was
more recently conﬁrmed by the 1991 DeWitte coaxial cable experiment performed in
the Brussels laboratories of Belgacom [10]. This ﬂow is related to galactic gravity ﬂow
eﬀects [9, 10, 11], and so is diﬀerent to that of the velocity of the earth with respect
to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is 369 km/s in the direction
RA = 11.20h, Dec = −7.220.

First consider the common but much smaller rotation induced ‘frame-dragging’ or
vorticity eﬀect. Then vR(r) = w × r in (16), where w is the angular velocity of the
earth, giving

observing the precession of the GP-B gyroscopes. The vorticity term in (23) leads to

and so ~ω/2 is the instantaneous angular velocity of precession of the gyroscope. This
corresponds to the well known ﬂuid result that the vorticity vector is twice the angular
velocity vector. For GP-B the direction of S has been chosen so that this precession
is cumulative and, on averaging over an orbit, corresponds to some 7.7 × 10−6 arcsec
per orbit, or 0.042 arcsec per year. GP-B has been superbly engineered so that
measurements to a precision of 0.0005 arcsec are possible.

This much larger component of the vorticity ﬁeld is shown in Fig.2. The maxi-
mum magnitude of the speed of this precession component is ω/2 = gvC /c2 =
8 × 10−6arcsec/s, where here g is the gravitational acceleration at the altitude of
the satellite. This precession has a diﬀerent signature:
it is not cumulative, and is
detectable by its variation over each single orbit, as its orbital average is zero, to ﬁrst
approximation. Fig.3 shows ∆Θ = |∆S(t)|/|S(0)| over one orbit, where, as in general,

Here ∆S(t) is the integrated change in spin, and where the approximation arises be-
cause the change in S(t′) on the RHS of (35) is negligible. The plot in Fig.3 shows this
eﬀect to be some 30× larger than the expected GP-B errors, and so easily detectable.
This precession is about the instantaneous direction of the vorticity ~ω(r((t)) at the
location of the satellite, and so is neither in the plane, as for the geodetic precession,
nor perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, as for the earth-rotation induced vorticity
eﬀect. This absolute motion induced spin precession is shown in Fig.4.

[10] predictions for four months throughout the year are shown in Fig.3. Such yearly
eﬀects were ﬁrst seen in the Miller [13] experiment.

However the main new feature of this paper is the detailed prediction of the magni-
tude and signature of the new gravitational-wave induced spin precessions that GP-B
is capable of detecting, but ﬁrst we brieﬂy summarise the history of the detection of
gravitational waves.

translation of the earth, as in (34) and Fig.2. This component of the spin precession forms
an elongated ellipse. Gravitational waves will cause changes in the size and orientation of
this precession ellipse. The angle ∆Θ in Fig.3 is the angle subtended at the earth’s centre by
the starting position at S and a point on this ellipse of precession. The precession caused by
the vorticity component arising from the rotation of the earth is perpendicular to the plane
of the orbit, while the geodetic precession component is in the plane of the orbit. The polar

km through a coaxial cable between Rue du Marais and Rue de la Paille, Brussels. An oﬀset
has been used such that the average is zero. The deﬁnition of the sign convention for ∆t used
by DeWitte is unclear. The cable has a North-South orientation, and the data is ± diﬀerence
of the travel times for NS and SN propagation. The sidereal time for maximum eﬀect of
∼17hr (or ∼5hr) (indicated by vertical lines) agrees with the direction found by Miller. Plot
shows data over 3 sidereal days and is plotted against sidereal time in hours. The regular time
variation is caused by the earth rotation changing the orientation of the cable with respect to
the direction of absolute linear motion.

7 Brief History of the Detection of Gravitational Waves

As already noted the velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld equations (13)-(14) have wave-like solutions
involving variations in both the magnitude and direction of the velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld.
Remarkably all the Michelson gas-mode interferometer and coaxial cable experiments
showed evidence of such wave phenomena [10]. The ﬁrst clear evidence was from the
Miller 1925/26 experiment. Miller oﬀered no explanation for these ﬂuctuations but
in his analysis of that data he did running time averages to remove these ﬂuctuation
eﬀects, though some of that could also have been instrumental noise. While some of
these ﬂuctuations may also be partially caused by weather related temperature and
pressure variations, the bulk of the ﬂuctuations appear to be larger than expected
from that cause alone. Even the original Michelson-Morley 1887 data shows variations
in the velocity ﬁeld and supports this interpretation. However it is signiﬁcant that the
non-interferometer 1991 DeWitte experiment also showed clear evidence of turbulence
of the velocity ﬂow ﬁeld, as shown in Fig.7. Just as the DeWitte data agrees with
the Miller data for speeds and directions of absolute motion, the magnitude of the
ﬂuctuations are also very similar [10]. It therefore becomes clear that there is strong
evidence for these ﬂuctuations being evidence of physical turbulence in the ﬂow ﬁeld.

Local Time days

Figure 6: Plot of the negative of the drift of the cross-over time between minimum and
maximum travel-time variation each day (at ∼ 10h ± 1h ST) versus local solar time for some
178 days. The straight line plot is the least squares ﬁt to the experimental data, giving an
average slope of 3.92 minutes/day. The time diﬀerence between a sidereal day and a solar
day is 3.93 minutes/day. This demonstrates that the eﬀect is related to sidereal time and
not local solar time. The ﬂuctuations apparent in the plot are caused by the slow changes in
direction of the ﬂow.

The magnitude of this turbulence appears to be larger than that which would be
caused by the in-ﬂow of quantum foam towards the sun, and indeed most of this
turbulence may be associated with galactic in-ﬂow into the Milky Way and local
galactic cluster. This in-ﬂow turbulence is a form of gravitational wave and the
ability of gas-mode Michelson interferometers to detect absolute motion means that
experimental evidence of such a wave phenomena has been available for a considerable
period of time. All this means that the new gravitational wave phenomena is very
easy to detect and amounts to new physics that can be studied in much detail.

The DeWitte 1991 experiment within Belgacom, the Belgium telecommunications
company, was a most impressive and high quality experiment that we now understand
to have detected gravitational waves [10]. In this serendipitous discovery two sets of
atomic clock in two buildings in Brussels, separated by 1.5 km, were used to time
5MHz radiofrequency signals travelling in each direction, through two buried coaxial
cables, with a N-S orientation, linking the two clusters. The atomic clocks were cesium
beam atomic clocks, and there were three in each cluster. In that way the stability
of the clocks could be established and monitored. One cluster was in a building on
Rue du Marais and the second cluster was due south in a building on Rue de la
Paille. Digital phase comparators were used to measure changes in times between
clocks within the same cluster and also in the propagation times of the RF signals.
Time diﬀerences between clocks within the same cluster showed a linear phase drift

16

caused by the clocks not having exactly the same frequency together with short term
and long term noise. However the long term drift was very linear and reproducible,
and that drift could be allowed for in analysing time diﬀerences in the propagation
times between the clusters.

Changes in propagation times were observed and eventually observations over 178
days were recorded. A sample of the data, plotted against sidereal time for just
three days, is shown in Fig.5. DeWitte recognised that the data was evidence of
absolute motion but he was unaware of the Miller experiment and did not realise that
the Right Ascension for minimum/maximum propagation time agreed almost exactly
with Miller’s direction (α = 5.2hr, δ = −670).
In fact DeWitte expected that the
direction of absolute motion should have been in the CMB direction, but that would
have given the data a totally diﬀerent sidereal time signature, namely the times for
maximum/minimum would have been shifted by approximately 6 hrs. The declination
of the velocity observed in this DeWitte experiment cannot be determined from the
data as only three days of data are available. However assuming exactly the same
declination as Miller the speed observed by DeWitte appears to be also in excellent
agreement with the Miller speed, which in turn is in agreement with that from the
Michelson-Morley and Illingworth experiments [10].

Importantly DeWitte reported the sidereal time of the cross-over time, that is a
‘zero’ time in Fig.5, for 178 days of data. This is plotted in Fig.6 and demonstrates
that the time variations are correlated with sidereal time and not local solar time. A
least squares best ﬁt of a linear relation to that data gives that the cross-over time
is retarded, on average, by 3.92 minutes per solar day. This is to be compared with
the fact that a sidereal day is 3.93 minutes shorter than a solar day. So the eﬀect
is certainly cosmological and not associated with any daily thermal eﬀects, which
in any case would be very small as the cable is buried. Miller had also compared
his data against sidereal time and established the same property, namely that up to
small diurnal eﬀects identiﬁable with the earth’s orbital motion, features in the data
tracked sidereal time and not solar time.

If the changes in propagation time through the coaxial cable were caused solely
by the rotation of the coaxial cable, carried along by the rotation of the earth, so
changing its orientation with respect to that of a uniform absolute velocity, then the
variations in travel time would not show the ﬂuctuations that are evident in Fig.5, but
only the dominant regular variation over each sidereal day. So these ﬂuctuations, and
they are much larger than any errors that were produced by the atomic clock timing
procedures, are manifestations of a genuine novel physical eﬀect. Here and in [9, 10]
they are interpreted as the gravitational waves predicted by the theory in Sect.5.
By ﬁtting the data to the time variation forms expected without such ﬂuctuations,
the ﬂuctuations themselves may extracted and their magnitude translated into speed
variations, as shown in Fig.7.

As well Torr and Kolen in 1984 also used a coaxial cable experiment to detect
absolute motion [10]. Unfortunately the cable was orientated in an E-W direction,
which made it relatively insensitive to the detection of absolute motion, as that is in

Sidereal Time - hours

Figure 7: Speed ﬂuctuations determined from Fig.5 over three sidereal days, or some 70
hours. A 1ns variation in travel time corresponds approximately to a speed variation of
27km/s. The larger speed ﬂuctuations are anomalies of the ﬁtting technique and actually
arise from a ﬂuctuation in the cross-over time, that is, a ﬂuctuation in the direction of the
velocity.

a near N-S direction, though the expected travel variations were indeed observed [10].
However being in the E-W direction the Torr-Kolen coaxial cable is very sensitive
to the directional changes associated with the turbulence. Being almost at 900 to
the direction of absolute motion, any variation in that direction produces signiﬁcant
eﬀects, as indeed reported by Torr and Kolen. So we have yet another experiment
in which the data is such that we have interpreted it as the detection of these new
gravitational waves.

8 Detection of Gravitational Waves by GP-B

The novel gravitational waves displayed in Fig.7 are signiﬁcant in magnitude com-
pared to the average absolute motion speed of some 430 km/s. For that reason they
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect upon the vorticity ﬁeld, and consequently of the GP-B spin
precessions. To give a ﬁrst indication of the expected size of these wave induced spin
precessions we have used the speed magnitude ﬂuctuations in Fig.7 by simply adding
these ﬂuctuations to the speed of 430 km/s in the direction RA = 5.2h, Dec= −670,
but without allowing for any ﬂuctuation in direction. Then the spin precession in
(35) was integrated over 40 orbits of the satellite, with the results shown in Fig.8
for September. This ﬁgure should be compared with the form in Fig.3 for only one
orbit, and without the gravitational wave eﬀect. We see the magnitude and signa-

Figure 8: Predicted variation of the precession angle ∆Θ = |∆S(t)|/|S(0)|, in arcsec, as
given by (35), over 40 GP-B orbits, from the vorticity induced by the absolute linear motion
of the earth, and with the mainly galactic gravitational waves now included by means of the
simulation described in the text. This plot shows the expected magnitude and signature of
the eﬀects of the gravitational waves. The corresponding prediction for one orbit, but without
the gravitational wave eﬀect, is shown in Fig.3. The main signature of the gravitational waves
for GP-B is the variation, from orbit to orbit, of the maximum precession angle, as shown
in this plot. The orbit time begins at location S in Fig.3. Predictions are for the month of
September. The GP-B expected angle measurement accuracy is 0.0005 arcsec.

ture of the gravitational wave induced spin precessions, including the eﬀect that the
absolute motion induced precessions now no longer return to zero after each orbit.
Whether this eﬀect persists over many months is not possible to predict, but if it
did persist then it would seriously interfere with, in particular, the observation of the
earth-rotation induced spin precession, which is cumulative but very small.

There is a technical diﬃculty in observing the eﬀects shown in Figs.3 and 8,
namely that the guide star is not visible to the on-board GP-B telescope during the
‘mid-part’ of each orbit, as is apparent from Fig.2.

9 Conclusions

By using the gravitational wave eﬀects revealed by the DeWitte coaxial cable absolute
linear motion experiment we have been able to simulate the eﬀects of these waves
upon the spin precession of the GP-B gyroscopes, in order that the signature of these
eﬀects may be recognised in the GP-B data. Both the absolute linear motion and the
new gravitational waves are properties of the new theory of space and gravity. These
eﬀects are absent from General Relativity, and which, most signiﬁcantly, has had only

19

one observational test, namely the binary pulsar slow-down, so far, of its dynamical
properties, as distinct from the various tests of the geodesic equation. The new
theory of gravity has explained a number of observational and laboratory eﬀects, but
in particular it has explained the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect as a dynamical property
of space itself; so it is not caused by any form of ‘matter’. So the ‘dark matter’ eﬀect
was a fatal ﬂaw of General Relativity. As well the spacetime ontology, as distinct from
the mathematical formalism, is also seriously ﬂawed by the fact that so far at least
seven experiments have detected absolute linear motion. The GP-B experiment will
also detect evidence of this absolute motion because of the vorticity associated with
that motion, that is, caused by the earth passing through space, which includes also
a much smaller vorticity caused by the earth’s rotation. This component is identical
to the vorticity caused by the earth’s rotation within General Relativity. So General
Relativity is in the paradoxical situation of permitting absolute rotational motion but
banning absolute linear motion. One major outcome of the GP-B experiment will be
the deﬁnitive resolution of this longstanding paradox.

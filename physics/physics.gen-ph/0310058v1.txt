ON MITCHELL-LAPLACE DARK BODY

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. The dark body of Mitchell-Laplace has nothing to do with
the relativistic black hole.

Many physicists believe that the notion of black hole (BH) is the natu-
ral relativistic generalization of the Newtonian notion of dark body (DB),
investigated by Michell (1784) and by Laplace (1796).

Now, as it has been shown by McVittie [1] (see also Eisenstaedt [2]),
the above belief is based only on “a play of words in expressions such as
the velocity of escape or the escape from a body”. Since a recent article by
Stephani [3] has given a further support to this conceptual confusion, it is
useful to recall here the very simple argument by McVittie.

Let us indeed consider a celestial spherical body of radius R and mass M .
According to Newtonian dynamics, the velocity of escape w of a particle,
which is projected radially outwards from the surface of the body, is given
by

(3)

(4)

Then, if

where G is the gravitational constant.
If the particle is projected with a velocity u smaller than w, i.e. if

it will arrive at a ﬁnite distance from the celestial body, and then it will

fall on its surface again.

By using the Newtonian corpuscular theory of light, which says that light
is composed of corpuscles obeying Newton’s law of gravitation, and travelling
with a given velocity c, Michell and Laplace remarked that if c < w the light
corpuscles cannot go away indeﬁnitely from the celestial body. Only if the
radius R of the body is such that

they can escape from the gravitational attraction exerted by the mass M .

the light corpuscles will attain a ﬁnite distance d from the celestial body,
and an observer situated at an intermediate distance between R and d will
see the celestial body, owing to the light corpuscles which arrive at his eyes.
If only the spherosymmetrical BH of GR existed – in reality this notion,
and the notion of Kerr’s BH, are the product of a misinterpretation of the
formalism of GR [4]–, it ought to have the fundamental property that neither
the material particles nor the light corpuscles can leave its surface. There-
fore, such an object would be invisible to any observer, however near he
might be. None of the phenomena observed by the experimentalists in the
region surrounding a DB of Michell-Laplace is present in the neighborhood
of a BH of GR.

The imagined connection with the Newtonian formula (3) comes out in
this way: if for the determination of the Einsteinian gravitational ﬁeld gen-
erated by a point mass M (Schwarzschild’s problem) one chooses the stan-
dard form – as Droste, Hilbert and Weyl (but not Schwarzschild [5]) did
– the radial coordinate r0 of the points of the space surface r = r0 (r0 is the
“radius of the BH”) is given by

(5)

r0 ≡ 2GM/c

;

this formula resembles the Newtonian formula (3), which concerns an
escape velocity c. But eq.(3) implies obviously that all observers – including
those at an inﬁnitely great distance from the celestial body – can see it. As
it is clear, the Newtonian dark body of Michell-Laplace is not a black hole!

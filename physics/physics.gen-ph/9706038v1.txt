Preface

This monograph gives a general geometric background of the theory of
ﬁeld interactions, strings and diﬀusion processes on spaces, superspaces and
isospaces with higher order anisotropy and inhomogenity. The last ﬁfteen
years have been attempted a number of extensions of Finsler geometry with
applications in theoretical and mathematical physics and biology which go
far beyond the original scope. Our approach proceeds by developing the
concept of higher order anisotropic superspace which unify the logical and
mathematical aspects of modern Kaluza–Klein theories and generalized La-
grange and Finsler geometry and leads to modelling of physical processes
on higher order ﬁber bundles provided with nonlinear and distingushed
connections and metric structures. The view adopted here is that a gen-

1

eral ﬁeld theory should incorporate all possible anisotropic and stochastic
manifestations of classical and quantum interactions and, in consequence, a
corresponding modiﬁcation of basic principles and mathematical methods
in formulation of physical theories. This monograph can be also considered
as a pedagogical survey on the mentioned subjects.

There are established three approaches for modeling ﬁeld interactions
and spaces anisotropies. The ﬁrst one is to deal with a usual locally
isotropic physical theory and to consider anisotropies as a consequence
of the anisotropic structure of sources in ﬁeld equations (for instance, a
number of cosmological models are proposed in the framework of the Ein-
stein theory with the energy–momentum generated by anisotropic matter,
as a general reference see [165]). The second approach to anisotropies
originates from the Finsler geometry [78,55,213,159] and its generalizations
[17,18,19,160,161,13,29, 256, 255, 264, 272] with a general imbedding into
Kaluza–Klein (super) gravity and string theories [269,270,260,265,266,267],
and speculates a generic anisotropy of the space–time structure and of fun-
damental ﬁeld of interactions. The Santilli’s approach [217,219,220,218,221,
222,223,224] is more radical by proposing a generalization of Lie theory
and introducing isoﬁelds, isodualities and related mathematical structures.
Roughly speaking, by using corresponding partitions of the unit we can
model possible metric anisotropies as in Finsler or generalized Lagrange ge-
ometry but the problem is also to take into account classes of anisotropies
generated by nonlinear and distinguished connections.

In its present version this book addresses itself both to mathematicians
and physicists, to researches and graduate students which are interested
in geometrical aspects of ﬁelds theories, extended (super)gravity and (su-
per)strings and supersymmetric diﬀusion. It presupposes a general back-
ground in the mentioned divisions of modern theoretical physics and as-
sumes some familiarity with diﬀerential geometry, group theory, complex
analysis and stochastic calculus.

The monograph is divided into three parts:
The ﬁrst ﬁve Chapters cover the higher order anisotropic supersymmet-
ric theories: Chapter 1 is devoted to the geometry of higher order anisotropic
supersaces with an extension to supergravity models in Chapter 2. The su-
persymmetric nearly autoparallel maps of superbundles and higher order
anisotropic conservation laws are considered in Chapter 3. Higher order
anisotropic superstrings and anomalies are studied in Chapter 4. Chap-

2

ter 5 contains an introduction into the theory of supersymmetric locally
anisotropic stochastic processes.

The next ﬁve Chapters are devoted to the (non supersymmetric) theory
of higher order anisotropic interactions and stochastic processes. Chapter 6
concerns the spinor formulation of ﬁeld theories with locally anisotropic in-
teractions and Chapter 7 considers anisotropic gauge ﬁeld and gauge gravity
models. Deﬁning nearly autoparallel maps as generalizations of conformal
transforms we analyze the problem of formulation of conservation laws in
higher order anisotropic spaces in Chapter 8. Nonlinear sigma models and
strings in locally anisotropic backgrounds are studied in Chapter 9. Chap-
ter 10 is devoted to the theory of stochastic diﬀerential equations for locally
anisotropic diﬀusion processes.

The rest four Chapters presents a study on Santilli’s locally anisotropic
and inhomogeneous isogeometries, namely, an introduction into the theory
of isobuncles and generalized isoﬁnsler gravity. Chapter 11 is devoted to
basic notations and deﬁnitions on Santilli and coauthors isotheory. We in-
troduce the bundle isospaces in Chapter 12 where some necessary properties
of Lie–Santilli isoalgebras and isogroups and corresponding isotopic exten-
sions of manifolds are applied in order to deﬁne ﬁber isospaces and consider
their such (being very important for modeling of isoﬁeld interactions) classes
of principal isobundles and vector isobundles.
In that Chapter there are
also studied the isogeometry of nonlinear isoconnections in vector isobun-
dles, the isotopic distinguishing of geometric objects, the isocurvatures and
isotorsions of nonlinear and distinguished isoconnections and the structure
equations and invariant conditions. The next Chapter 13 is devoted to
the isotopic extensions of generalized Lagrange and Finsler geometries. In
Chapter 14 the isoﬁeld equations of locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous
interactions will be analyzed and an outlook and conclusions will be pre-
sented.

We have not attempted to give many details on previous knowledge
of the subjects or complete list of references. Each Chapter contains a
brief introduction, the ﬁrst section reviews the basic results, original papers
and monographs. If it is considered necessary, outlook and discussion are
presented at the end of the Chapter.

We hope that the reader will not suﬀer too much from our insuﬃcient

mastery of the English language.

Part I. Higher Order Anisotropic Supersymmetry

Capter 1. HA–Superspaces

The diﬀerential supergeometry have been formulated with the aim of get-
ting a geometric framework for the supersymmetric ﬁeld theories (see the
theory of graded manifolds [37,146,147,144], the theory of supermanifolds
[290,203,27,127] and, for detailed considerations of geometric and topologi-
cal aspects of supermanifolds and formulation of superanalysis, [63,49,157,
114,281,283]). In this Chapter we apply the supergeometric formalism for
a study of a new class of (higher order anisotropic) superspaces.

The concept of local anisotropy is largely used in some divisions of the-
oretical and mathematical physics [282,119,122,163] (see also possible ap-
plications in physics and biology in [14,13]). The ﬁrst models of locally
anisotropic (la) spaces (la–spaces) have been proposed by P.Finsler [78] and
E.Cartan [55] (early approaches and modern treatments of Finsler geom-
etry and its extensions can be found, for instance, in [213,17,18,159]). In
our works [256,255,258,259,260,264,272,279,276] we try to formulate the ge-
ometry of la–spaces in a manner as to include both variants of Finsler and
Lagrange, in general supersymmetric, extensions and higher dimensional
Kaluza–Klein (super)spaces as well to propose general principles and meth-
ods of construction of models of classical and quantum ﬁeld interactions
and stochastic processes on spaces with generic anisotropy.

We cite here the works [31,33] by A. Bejancu where a new viewpoint
on diﬀerential geometry of supermanifolds is considered. The author in-
troduced the nonlinear connection (N–connection) structure and developed
a corresponding distinguished by N–connection supertensor covariant dif-
ferential calculus in the frame of De Witt [290] approach to supermani-

4

folds in the framework of the geometry of superbundles with typical ﬁbres
parametrized by noncommutative coordinates. This was the ﬁrst example
of superspace with local anisotropy. In our turn we have given a general def-
inition of locally anisotropic superspaces (la–superspaces) [260]. It should
be noted here that in our supersymmetric generalizations we were inspired
by the R. Miron, M. Anastasiei and Gh. Atanasiu works on the geometry of
nonlinear connections in vector bundles and higher order Lagrange spaces
[160,161,162]. In this Chapter we shall formulate the theory of higher order
vector and tangent superbundles provided with nonlinear and distinguished
connections and metric structures (a generalized model of la–superspaces).
Such superbundles contain as particular cases the supersymmetric exten-
sions and various higher order prolongations of Riemann, Finsler and La-
grange spaces. We shall use instead the terms distinguished superbundles,
distinguished geometric objects and so on (geometrical constructions distin-
guished by a N–connection structure) theirs corresponding brief denotations
(d–superbundles, d–objects and so on).

The Chapter is organized as follows: Section 1.1 contains a brief review
on supermanifolds and superbundles and an introduction into the geometry
of higher order distinguished vector superbundles. Section 1.2 deals with
the geometry of nonlinear and linear distinguished connections in vector
superbundles and distinguished vector superbundles. The geometry of the
total space of distinguished vector superbundles is studied in section 1.3;
distinguished connection and metric structures, their torsions, curvatures
and structure equations are considered. Generalized Lagrange and Finsler
superspaces there higher order prolongations are deﬁned in section 1.4 .
Concluding remarks on Chapter 1 are contained in section 1.5.

Chapter 2. HA–Supergravity

In this Chapter we shall analyze three models of supergravity with higher
order anisotropy. We shall begin our considerations with N–connection s–
spaces in section 2.1. Such s–spaces are generalizations of ﬂat s–spaces
containing a nontrivial N–connection structure but with vanishing d–con-
nection. We shall introduce locally adapted s–vielbeins and deﬁne s–ﬁelds
and diﬀerential forms in N–connection s–spaces. Sections 2.2 and 2.3 are
correspondingly devoted to gauge s-ﬁeld and s–gravity theory in osculator
s–bundles.
In order to have the possibility to compare our model with
usual N=1 ( one dimensional supersymmetric extensions; see, for instance,

5

286,170,215]) supergravitational models we develop a supergavity theory
on osculator s–bundle Oscz fM(M ) where the even part of s–manifold fM(M )
has a local structure of Minkowski space with action of Poincare group.
In this case we do not have problems connected with deﬁnition of spinors
(Lorentz, Weyl or Maiorana type) for spaces of arbitrary dimensions and
can solve Bianchi identities. As a matter of principle, by using our re-
sults on higher dimensional and locally anisotropic spaces, see [256,255] we
can introduce distinguished spinor stuctures and develop variants of ex-
tended supergravity with general higher order anisotropy. This approach
is based on global geometric constructions and allows us to avoid tedious
variational calculations and deﬁne the basic ﬁeld equations and conserva-
tion laws on s–spaces with local anisotropy. That why, in section 2.5, we
introduce Einstein–Cartan equations on distinguished vector superbundles
(locally parametrized by arbitrary both type commuting and anticommut-
ing coordinates) in a geometric manner, in some line following the geo-
metric background for Einstein realtivity, but in our case on dvs-bundels
provided with arbitrary N–connection and distinguished torsion and metric
structures. We can consider diﬀerent models, for instance, with prescribed
N–connection and torsions, to develop a Einstein–Cartan like theory, or to
follow approaches from gauge gravity. In section 2.6 we propose a variant
of gauge like higher anisotropic supergravity being a generalization to dvs–
bundles of models of locally anisotropic gauge gravity [258,259,272] (see also
Chapter 7 in this monograph).

Chapter 3. Supersymmetric NA–Maps

The study of models of classical and quantum ﬁeld interactions in higher
dimension superspaces with, or not, local anisotropy is in order of the day.
The development of this direction entails great diﬃculties because of prob-
lematical character of the possibility and manner of deﬁnition of conserva-
tion laws on la–spaces. It will be recalled that conservation laws of energy–
momentum type are a consequence of existence of a global group of auto-
morphisms of the fundamental Mikowski spaces. As a rule one considers
the tangent space’s automorphisms or symmetries conditioned by the exis-
tence of Killing vectors on curved (pseudo)Riemannian spaces. There are
not any global or local automorphisms on generic la–spaces and in result
of this fact, at ﬁrst glance, there are a lot of substantial diﬃculties with
formulation of conservation laws and, in general, of physical consistent ﬁeld

6

theories with local anisotropy. R. Miron and M. Anastasiei investigated the
nonzero divergence of the matter energy–momentum d–tensor, the source
in Einstein equations on la–spaces, and considered an original approach to
In a series of
the geometry of time–dependent Lagrangians [12,160,161].
papers [249,276,263,273,274,278,279,252,275,277] we attempt to solve the
problem of deﬁnition of energy-momentum values for locally isotropic and
anisotropic gravitational and matter ﬁelds interactions and of conservation
laws for basic physical values on spaces with local anisotropy in the frame-
work of the theory of nearly geodesic and nearly autoparallel maps.

In this Chapter a necessary geometric background (the theory of nearly
autoparallel maps, in brief na-maps, and tensor integral formalism) for for-
mulation and investigation of conservation laws on higher order isotropic
and anisotropic superspaces is developed. The class of na–maps contains
as a particular case the conformal transforms and is characterized by corre-
sponding invariant conditions for generalized Weyl tensors and Thomas pa-
rameters [227,230]. We can connect the na–map theory with the formalism
of tensor integral and multitensors on distinguished vector superbundles.
This approaches based on generalized conformal transforms of superspaces
with or not diﬀerent types of higher order anisotropy consist a new division
of diﬀerential supergeometry with applications in modern theoretical and
mathematical physics.

We note that in most cases proofs of our theorems are mechanical but
rather tedious calculations similar to those presented in [230,252,263]. Some
of them will be given in detail, the rest will be sketched. We shall omit split-
ting of formulas into even and odd components (see Chapter 8 on nearly
autoparallel maps and conservation laws for higher order (non supersym-
metric) anisotropic spaces).

Section 3.1 is devoted to the formulation of the theory of nearly autopar-
allel maps of dvs–bundles. The classiﬁcation of na–maps and formulation
of their invariant conditions are given in section 3.2.
In section 3.3 we
deﬁne the nearly autoparallel tensor–integral on locally anisotropic multi-
spaces. The problem of formulation of conservation laws on spaces with
local anisotropy is studied in section 3.4. Some conclusions are presented
in section 3.5.

Chapter 4. HA–Superstrings

The superstring theory holds the greatest promise as the uniﬁcation the-

7

ory of all fundamental interactions. The superstring models contains a lot
a characteristic features of Kaluza–Klein approaches, supersymmetry and
supergravity, local ﬁeld theory and dual models. We note that in the string
theories the nonlocal one dimensional quantum objects (strings) mutually
interacting by linking and separating together are considered as fundamental
values. Perturbations of the quantized string are identiﬁed with quantum
particles. Symmetry and conservation laws in the string and superstring
theory can be considered as sweeping generalizations of gauge principles
which consists the basis of quantum ﬁeld models. The new physical con-
cepts are formulated in the framework a ”new” for physicists mathematical
formalism of the algebraic geometry and topology [106].

The relationship between two dimensional σ-models and strings has been
considered [153,80,53,229,7] in order to discuss the eﬀective low energy ﬁeld
equations for the massless models of strings. Nonlinear σ-models makes up a
class of quantum ﬁeld systems for which the ﬁelds are also treated as coordi-
nates of some manifolds. Interactions are introduced in a geometric manner
and admit a lot of applications and generalizations in classical and quantum
ﬁeld and string theories. The geometric structure of nonlinear sigma models
manifests the existence of topological nontrivial conﬁguration, admits a geo-
metric interpretation of conterterms and points to a substantial interrelation
between extended supersymmetry and diﬀerential supergeometry. In con-
nection to this a new approach based on nonlocal, in general, higher order
anisotropic constructions seem to be emerging [254,269,261]. We consider
the reader to be familiar with basic results from supergeometry (see, for
instance, [63,147,290,203]), supergravity theories [86,215,288,286,287] and
superstrings [115,289,139,140].

In this Chapter we shall present an introduction into the theory of
higher order anisotropic superstrings being a natural generalization to lo-
cally anisotropic (la) backgrounds (we shall write in brief la-backgrounds,
la-spaces and la-geometry) of the Polyakov’s covariant functional-integral
approach to string theory [193]. Our aim is to show that a corresponding
low-energy string dynamics contains the motion equations for ﬁeld equa-
tions on higher order anisotropic superspaces and to analyze the geometry
of the perturbation theory of the locally anisotropic supersymmetric sigma
models. We note that this Chapter is devoted to supersymmetric models
of locally anisotropic superstrings (details on the so called bosonic higher
order anisotropic strings are given in the Chapter 9).

The plan of presentation in the Chapter is as follows. Section 4.1 con-
tains an introduction into the geometry of two dimensional higher order
anisotropic sigma models and an locally anisotropic approach to heterotic
In section 4.2 the background ﬁeld method for σ-models is gen-
strings.
eralized for a distinguished calculus locally adapted to the N–connection
structure in higher order anisotropic superspaces. Section 4.3 is devoted
to a study of Green–Schwartz action in distinguished vector superbundles.
Fermi strings in higher order anisotropic spaces are considered in section
4.4. An example of one–loop and two–loop calculus for anomalies of locally
anisotropic strings is presented in section 4.5. Conclusions are drawn in
section 4.6.

Chapter 5. Stochastics in LAS–Spaces

We shall describe the analytic results which combine the fermionic Brow-
nian motion with stochastic integration in higher order anisotropic spaces.
It will be shown that a wide class of stochastic diﬀerential equations in lo-
cally anisotropic superspaces have solutions. Such solutions will be than
used to derive a Feynman–Kac formula for higher order anisotropic sys-
tems. We shall achieve this by introducing locally anisotropic superpaths
parametrized by a commuting and an anticommuting time variable. The
supersymmetric stochastic techniques employed in this Chapter was devel-
oped by A. Rogers in a series of works [206,207,205,209,210] (superpaths
have been also considered in papers [103,82] and [198]). One of the main
our purposes is to extend this formalism in order to formulate the theory
of higher order anisotropic processes in distinguished vector superbundles
[260,262,265,266,267,253,268]. Stochastic calculus for bosonic and fermionic
Brownian paths will provide a geometric approach to Brownian motion in
locally anisotropic superspaces.

Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of this Chapter contain correspondingly a brief
introduction into the subject and a brief review of fermionic Brownian mo-
tion and path integration. Section 5.3 considers distinguished stochastic
integrals in the presence of fermionic paths. Some results in calculus on a
(1,1)–dimensional superspace and two supersymmetric formulae for super-
paths are described in section 5.4 and than, in section 5.5, the theorem on
the existence of unique solutions to a useful class of distinguished stochas-
tic diﬀerential equations is proved and the distinguished supersymmetric

9

Feynman–Kac formula is established. Section 5.6 deﬁnes some higher or-
der anisotropic manifolds which can be constructed from a vector bundle
over a vector bundle provided with compatible nonlinear and distinguished
connection and metric structures. In section 5.7 a geometric formulation of
Brownian paths on higher order anisotropic manifolds is contained; these
paths are used to give a Feynman–Kac formula for the Laplace–Beltrami
operator for twisted diﬀerential forms. This formula is used to give a proof
of the index theorem using supersymmetry of the higher order anisotropic
superspaces in section 5.8 (we shall apply the methods developed in [4,82]
and [209,210].

Part II. Higher Order Anisotropic Interactions

Chapter 6. HA–Spinors

Some of fundamental problems in physics advocate the extension to lo-
cally anisotropic and higher order anisotropic backgrounds of physical the-
ories [159,161,13,29,18,162,272,265,266,267]. In order to construct physical
models on higher order anisotropic spaces it is necessary a corresponding
generalization of the spinor theory. Spinor variables and interactions of
spinor ﬁelds on Finsler spaces were used in a heuristic manner, for instance,
in works [18,177], where the problem of a rigorous deﬁnition of la-spinors for
la-spaces was not considered. Here we note that, in general, the nontrivial
nonlinear connection and torsion structures and possible incompatibility of
metric and connections makes the solution of the mentioned problem very
sophisticate. The geometric deﬁnition of la-spinors and a detailed study of
the relationship between Cliﬀord, spinor and nonlinear and distinguished
connections structures in vector bundles, generalized Lagrange and Finsler
spaces are presented in refs. [256,255,264].

The purpose of the Chapter is to summarize and extend our investi-
gations [256,255,264,272,260] on formulation of the theory of classical and
quantum ﬁeld interactions on higher order anisotropic spaces. We receive
primary attention to the development of the necessary geometric framework:
to propose an abstract spinor formalism and formulate the diﬀerential ge-
ometry of higher order anisotropic spaces . The next step is the investiga-
tion of higher order anisotropic interactions of fundamental ﬁelds on generic
higher order anisotropic spaces (in brief we shall use instead of higher order
anisotropic the abbreviation ha-, for instance, ha–spaces, ha–interactions

10

and ha–spinors).

In order to develop the higher order anisotropic spinor theory it will
be convenient to extend the Penrose and Rindler abstract index formalism
[180,181,182] (see also the Luehr and Rosenbaum index free methods [154])
proposed for spinors on locally isotropic spaces. We note that in order to
formulate the locally anisotropic physics usually we have dimensions d > 4
for the fundamental, in general higher order anisotropic space–time and to
take into account physical eﬀects of the nonlinear connection structure. In
this case the 2-spinor calculus does not play a preferential role.

Section 6.1 of this Chapter contains an introduction into the geometry
of higher order anisotropic spaces, the distinguishing of geometric objects
by N–connection structures in such spaces is analyzed, explicit formulas
for coeﬃcients of torsions and curvatures of N- and d–connections are pre-
sented and the ﬁeld equations for gravitational interactions with higher
order anisotropy are formulated. The distinguished Cliﬀord algebras are
introduced in section 6.2 and higher order anisotropic Cliﬀord bundles are
deﬁned in section 6.3. We present a study of almost complex structure for
the case of locally anisotropic spaces modeled in the framework of the al-
most Hermitian model of generalized Lagrange spaces in section 6.4. The
d–spinor techniques is analyzed in section 6.5 and the diﬀerential geometry
of higher order anisotropic spinors is formulated in section 6.6. The section
6.7 is devoted to geometric aspects of the theory of ﬁeld interactions with
higher order anisotropy (the d–tensor and d–spinor form of basic ﬁeld equa-
tions for gravitational, gauge and d–spinor ﬁelds are introduced). Finally,
an outlook and conclusions on ha–spinors are given in section 6.8.

Chapter 7. Gauge and Gravitational Ha–Fields

Despite the charm and success of general relativity there are some fun-
damental problems still unsolved in the framework of this theory. Here we
point out the undetermined status of singularities, the problem of formula-
tion of conservation laws in curved spaces, and the unrenormalizability of
quantum ﬁeld interactions. To overcome these defects a number of authors
(see, for example, Refs. [240,285,194,3]) tended to reconsider and reformu-
late gravitational theories as a gauge model similar to the theories of weak,
electromagnetic, and strong forces. But, in spite of theoretical arguments
and the attractive appearance of diﬀerent proposed models of gauge gravity,

11

the possibility and manner of interpretation of gravity as a kind of gauge
interaction remain unclear.

The work of Popov and Daikhin [195,196] is distinguished among other
gauge approaches to gravity. Popov and Dikhin did not advance a gauge
extension, or modiﬁcation, of general relativity; they obtained an equivalent
reformulation (such as well-known tetrad or spinor variants) of the Einstein
equations as Yang-Mills equations for correspondingly induced Cartan con-
nections [40] in the aﬃne frame bundle on the pseudo-Riemannian space
time. This result was used in solving some speciﬁc problems in mathemat-
ical physics, for example, for formulation of a twistor-gauge interpretation
of gravity and of nearly autoparallel conservation laws on curved spaces
[246,250,252,249,233]. It has also an important conceptual role. On one
hand, it points to a possible uniﬁed treatment of gauge and gravitational
ﬁelds in the language of linear connections in corresponding vector bun-
dles. On the other, it emphasize that the types of fundamental interactions
mentioned essentially diﬀer one from another, even if we admit for both of
them a common gauge like formalism, because if to Yang-Mills ﬁelds one
associates semisimple gauge groups, to gauge treatments of Einstein gravi-
tational ﬁelds one has to introduce into consideration nonsemisimple gauge
groups.

Recent developments in theoretical physics suggest the idea that a more
adequate description of radiational, statistical, and relativistic optic eﬀects
in classical and quantum gravity requires extensions of the geometric back-
ground of theories [282,163,13,14,15,28,29,118,119,120,122,212,235,236,238,
280,41] by introducing into consideration spaces with local anisotropy and
formulating corresponding variants of Lagrange and Finsler gravity and
theirs extensions to higher order anisotropic spaces [295,162,266,267,268].

The aim of this Chapter is twofold. The ﬁrst objective is to present our
results [272,258,259] on formulation of geometrical approach to interactions
of Yang-Mills ﬁelds on spaces with higher order anisotropy in the framework
of the theory of linear connections in vector bundles (with semisimple struc-
tural groups) on ha-spaces. The second objective is to extend the geomet-
rical formalism in a manner including theories with nonsemisimple groups
which permit a unique ﬁber bundle treatment for both locally anisotropic
Yang-Mills ﬁeld and gravitational interactions. In general lines, we shall fol-
low the ideas and geometric methods proposed in refs. [240,195,196,194,40]
but we shall apply them in a form convenient for introducing into consider-

12

ation geometrical constructions[160,161] and physical theories on ha-spaces.
There is a number of works on gauge models of interactions on Finsler
spaces and theirs extensions(see, for instance, [17,18,19,28,164,177]). One
has introduced diﬀerent variants of generalized gauge transforms, postulated
corresponding Lagrangians for gravitational, gauge and matter ﬁeld inter-
actions and formulated variational calculus (here we note the approach de-
veloped by A. Bejancu [30,32,29]). The main problem of such models is the
dependence of the basic equations on chosen deﬁnition of gauge ”compensa-
tion” symmetries and on type of space and ﬁeld interactions anisotropy. In
order to avoid the ambiguities connected with particular characteristics of
possible la-gauge theories we consider a ”pure” geometric approach to gauge
theories (on both locally isotropic and anisotropic spaces) in the framework
of the theory of ﬁber bundles provided in general with diﬀerent types of non-
linear and linear multiconnection and metric structures. This way, based on
global geometric methods, holds also good for nonvariational, in the total
spaces of bundles, gauge theories (in the case of gauge gravity based on
Poincare or aﬃne gauge groups); physical values and motion (ﬁeld) equa-
tions have adequate geometric interpretation and do not depend on the type
of local anisotropy of space-time background. It should be emphasized here
that extensions for higher order anisotropic spaces which will be presented
in this Chapter can be realized in a straightforward manner.
The presentation in the Chapter is organized as follows:
In section 7.1 we give a geometrical interpretation of gauge (Yang-Mills)
ﬁelds on general ha-spaces. Section 7.2 contains a geometrical deﬁnition
of anisotropic Yang-Mills equations; the variational proof of gauge ﬁeld
equations is considered in connection with the ”pure” geometrical method
of introducing ﬁeld equations. In section 7.3 the ha–gravity is reformulated
as a gauge theory for nonsemisimple groups. A model of nonlinear de Sitter
gauge gravity with local anisotropy is formulated in section 7.4. We study
gravitational gauge instantons with trivial local anisotropy in section 7.5.
Some remarks are given in section 7.6.

Chapter 8. Na–Maps and Conservation Laws

Theories of ﬁeld interactions on locally anisotropic curved spaces form
a new branch of modern theoretical and mathematical physics. They are
used for modelling in a self–consistent manner physical processes in locally

13

anisotropic, stochastic and turbulent media with beak radiational reaction
and diﬀusion [161,13,14,282]. The ﬁrst model of locally anisotropic space
was proposed by P.Finsler [78] as a generalization of Riemannian geometry;
here we also cite the fundamental contribution made by E. Cartan [55] and
mention that in monographs [213,159,17,19,29] detailed bibliographies are
contained. In this Chapter we follow R. Miron and M. Anastasiei [160,161]
conventions and base our investigations on their general model of locally
anisotropic (la) gravity (in brief we shall write la-gravity) on vector bundles,
v–bundles, provided with nonlinear and distinguished connection and metric
structures (we call a such type of v–bundle as a la-space if connections and
metric are compatible).

The study of models of classical and quantum ﬁeld interactions on la-
spaces is in order of the day. For instance, the problem of deﬁnition of
spinors on la-spaces is already solved (see [256,275,264] and Chapter 6
and some models of locally anisotropic Yang–Mills and gauge like gravi-
tational interactions are analyzed (see [272,263] and Chapter 7 and alter-
native approaches in [17,29,122,119]). The development of this direction
entails great diﬃculties because of problematical character of the possibil-
ity and manner of deﬁnition of conservation laws on la-spaces. It will be
recalled that, for instance, conservation laws of energy–momentum type are
a consequence of existence of a global group of automorphisms of the funda-
mental Mikowski spaces (for (pseudo)Riemannian spaces the tangent space’
automorphisms and particular cases when there are symmetries generated
by existence of Killing vectors are considered). No global or local automor-
phisms exist on generic la-spaces and in result of this fact the formulation
of la-conservation laws is sophisticate and full of ambiguities. R. Miron
and M. Anastasiei ﬁrstly pointed out the nonzero divergence of the matter
energy-momentum d–tensor, the source in Einstein equations on la-spaces,
and considered an original approach to the geometry of time–dependent
Lagrangians [12,160,161]. Nevertheless, the rigorous deﬁnition of energy-
momentum values for la-gravitational and matter ﬁelds and the form of
conservation laws for such values have not been considered in present–day
studies of the mentioned problem.

The aim of this Chapter is to develop a necessary geometric background
(the theory of nearly autoparallel maps, in brief na-maps, and tensor integral
formalism on la-multispaces) for formulation and a detailed investigation of
conservation laws on locally isotropic and anisotropic curved spaces. We

14

shall summarize our results on formulation of na-maps for generalized aﬃne
spaces (GAM-spaces) [249,251,273], Einstein-Cartan and Einstein spaces
[250,247,278] bundle spaces [250,247,278] and diﬀerent classes of la-spaces
[279,276,102,263] and present an extension of the na-map theory for su-
perspaces. For simplicity we shall restrict our considerations only with the
”ﬁrst” order anisotropy (the basic results on higher order anisotropies a pre-
sented in a supersymmetric manner Chapter 3. Comparing the geometric
constructions from both Chapters on na–map theory we assure ourselves
that the developed methods hold good for all type of curved spaces (with
or not torsion, locally isotropic or even with local anisotropy and being,
In order to make the reader more familiar with
or not, supesymmetric).
na–maps and theirs applications and to point to some common features, as
well to proper particularities of the supersymmetric and higher order con-
structions, we shall recirculate some basic deﬁnitions, theorems and proofs
from Chapter 3.

The question of deﬁnition of tensor integration as the inverse operation
of covariant derivation was posed and studied by A.Mo´or [167]. Tensor–
integral and bitensor formalisms turned out to be very useful in solving
certain problems connected with conservation laws in general relativity
[100,247].
In order to extend tensor–integral constructions we have pro-
posed [273,278] to take into consideration nearly autoparallel [249,247,250]
and nearly geodesic [230] maps, ng–maps, which forms a subclass of local
1–1 maps of curved spaces with deformation of the connection and metric
structures. A generalization of the Sinyukov’s ng–theory for spaces with
local anisotropy was proposed by considering maps with deformation of
connection for Lagrange spaces (on Lagrange spaces see [136,160,161]) and
generalized Lagrange spaces [263,279,276,275,101]. Tensor integration for-
malism for generalized Lagrange spaces was developed in [255,102,263]. One
of the main purposes of this Chapter is to synthesize the results obtained
in the mentioned works and to formulate them for a very general class of
la–spaces. As the next step the la–gravity and analysis of la–conservation
laws are considered.

We note that proofs of our theorems are mechanical, but,

in most
cases, they are rather tedious calculations similar to those presented in
[230,252,263]. Some of them, on la-spaces, will be given in detail the rest,
being similar, or consequences, will be only sketched or omitted.

Section 8.1 is devoted to the formulation of the theory of nearly au-

15

toparallel maps of la–spaces. The classiﬁcation of na–maps and formulation
of their invariant conditions are given in section 8.2.
In section 8.3 we
deﬁne the nearly autoparallel tensor–integral on locally anisotropic multi-
spaces. The problem of formulation of conservation laws on spaces with
local anisotropy is studied in section 8.4 . We present a deﬁnition of conser-
vation laws for la–gravitational ﬁelds on na–images of la–spaces in section
8.5. Finally, in this Chapter, section 8.6, we analyze the locally isotropic
limit, to the Einstein gravity and it generalizations, of the na-conservation
laws.

Chapter 9. HA–Strings

The relationship between two dimensional σ-models and strings has
been considered [153,80,53,229,7] in order to discuss the eﬀective low en-
ergy ﬁeld equations for the massless models of strings. In this Chapter we
shall study some of the problems associated with the theory of higher order
anisotropic strings being a natural generalization to higher order anisotropic
backgrounds (we shall write in brief ha–backgrounds, ha–spaces and ha–
geometry) of the Polyakov’s covariant functional–integral approach to string
theory [193]. Our aim is to show that a corresponding low–energy string
dynamics contains the motion equations for ﬁeld equations on ha-spaces;
models of ha–gravity could be more adequate for investigation of quantum
gravitational and Early Universe cosmology.

The plan of the Chapter is as follows. We begin, section 9.1, with a
study of the nonlinear σ–model and ha–string propagation by developing
the d–covariant method of ha–background ﬁeld. Section 9.2 is devoted to
problems of regularization and renormalization of the locally anisotropic σ–
model and a corresponding analysis of one- and two–loop diagrams of this
model. Scattering of ha-gravitons and duality are considered in section 9.3,
and a summary and conclusions are drawn in section 9.4.

Chapter 10. Stochastic Processes on HA–Spaces

The purpose of investigations in this Chapter [253,262] is to extend
the formalism of stochastic calculus to the case of spaces with higher or-
der anisotropy (distinguished vector bundles with compatible nonlinear and
distinguished connections and metric structures and generalized Lagrange

16

and Finsler spaces). We shall examine nondegenerate diﬀusions on the men-
tioned spaces and theirs horizontal lifts.

Probability theorists, physicists, biologists and ﬁnanciers are already
familiar with classical and quantum statistical and geometric methods ap-
plied in various branches of science and economy [13,14,171,189,131,84,141].
We note that modeling of diﬀusion processes in nonhomogerneous media
and formulation of nonlinear thermodynamics in physics, or of dynamics
of evolution of species in biology, requires a more extended geometrical
background than that used in the theory of stochastic diﬀerential equations
and diﬀusion processes on Riemann, Lorentz manifolds [117,74,75,76] and
in Rieman–Cartan–Weyl spaces [197,199].

Our aim is to formulate the theory of diﬀusion processes on spaces with
local anisotropy. As a model of such spaces we choose vector bundles on
space-times provided with nonlinear and distinguished connections and met-
ric structures [160,161]. Transferring our considerations on tangent bundles
we shall formulate the theory of stochastic diﬀerential equations on gen-
eralized Lagrange spaces which contain as particular cases Lagrange and
Finsler spaces [213,17,18,29,159].

The plan of the presentation in the Chapter is as follow: We present
a brief introduction into the theory of stochastic diﬀerential equations and
diﬀusion processes on Euclidean spaces in section 10.1. In section 10.2 we
give a brief summary of the geometry of higher order anisotropic spaces.
Section 10.3 is dedicated to the formulation of the theory of stochastic dif-
ferential equations in distinguished vector bundle spaces. This section also
concerns the basic aspects of stochastic calculus in curved spaces. In section
10.4 the heat equations in bundle spaces are analyzed. The nondegenerate
diﬀusion on spaces with higher order anisotropy is deﬁned in section 10.5.
We shall generalize in section 10.6 the results of section 10.4 to the case
of heat equations for distinguished tensor ﬁelds in vector bundles with (or
not) boundary conditions. Section 10.7 contains concluding remarks and a
discussion of the obtained results.

Part III. Isobundles and Generalized Isoﬁnsler Gravity

Chapter 11. Basic Notions on Isotopies

This Part is devoted to a generalization [271] of the geometry of Santilli’s
locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous isospaces [217,219,220,218,221,222,

17

223,224] to the geometry of vector isobundles provided with nonlinear and
distinguished isoconnections and isometric structures. We present, appar-
ently for the ﬁrst time, the isotopies of Lagrange, Finsler and Kaluza–Klein
spaces. We also continue the study of the interior, locally anisotropic and in-
homogeneous gravitation by extending the isoriemannian space’s construc-
tions and presenting a geometric background for the theory of isoﬁeld in-
teractions in generalized isolagrange and isoﬁnsler spaces.

The main purpose of this Part is to formulate a synthesis of the Santilli
isotheory and the approach on modeling locally anisotropic geometries and
physical models on bundle spaces provided with nonlinear connection and
distinguished connection and metric structures [160,161,295]. The isotopic
variants of generalized Lagrange and Finsler geometry will be analyzed.
Basic geometric constructions such as nonlinear isoconnections in vector
isobundles, the isotopic curvatures and torsions of distinguished isoconnec-
tions and theirs structure equations and invariant values will be deﬁned. A
model of locally anisotropic and inhomogeneous gravitational isotheory will
be constructed.

Our study of Santilli’s isospaces and isogeometries over isoﬁelds will
be treated via the isodiﬀerential calculus according to their latest formu-
lation [224] (we extend this calculus for isospaces provided with nonlinear
isoconnection structure). We shall also use Kadeisvili’s notion of isocontinu-
ity [129,130] and the novel Santilli–Tsagas–Sourlas isodiﬀerential topology
[223,239,232].

After reviewing the basic elements for completeness as well as for nota-
tional convenience, we shall extend Santilli’s foundations of the isosympletic
geometry [223] to isobundles and related aspects (by applying, in an iso-
topic manner, the methods summarized in Miron and Anastasiei [160,161]
and Yano and Ishihara [295] monographs). We shall apply our results on iso-
topies of Lagrange, Finsler and Kaluza–Klein geometries to further studies
of the isogravitational theories (for isoriemannian spaces ﬁrstly considered
by Santilli [223]) on vector isobundle provided with compatible nonlinear
and distinguished isoconnections and isometric structures. Such isogeomet-
rical models of isoﬁeld interaction isotheories are in general nonlinear, non-
local and nonhamiltonian and contain a very large class of local anisotropies
and inhomogeneities induced by four fundamental isostructures: the par-
tition of unity, nonlinear isoconnection, distinguished isoconnections and
isometric.

18

The novel geometric proﬁle emerging from all the above studies is rather
remarkable inasmuch as the ﬁrst class of all isotopies herein considered
(called Kadeisvili’s Class I [129,130]) preserves the abstract axioms of con-
ventional formulations, yet permits a clear broadening of their applicability,
and actually result to be ”directly universal” [223] for a number of possible
well behaved nonlinear, nonlocal and nonhamiltonian systems. In turn, this
permits a number of geometric uniﬁcation such as that of all possible met-
rics (on isospaces with trivial nonlinear isoconnection structure) of a given
dimension into Santilli’s isoeuclidean metric, the uniﬁcation of exterior and
interior gravitational problems despite their sizable structural diﬀerences
and other uniﬁcation.

Chapter 12. Isobundle Spaces

This chapter serves the twofold purpose of establishing of abstract index
denotations and starting the geometric backgrounds of isotopic locally ani-
sotropic extensions of the isoriemannian spaces which are used in the next
chapters of the work.

Chapter 13. The Isogeometry of Tangent Isobundles

The aim of this Chapter is to formulate some results in the isogeometry
of tangent isobundle, t–isobundle, dT M and to use them in order to develop
the geometry of Finsler and Lagrange isospaces.

Chapter 14. Locally Anisotropic and Inhomogeneous Isogravity

The conventional Riemannian geometry can be generally assumed to be
exactly valid for the exterior gravitational problem in vacuum where bodies
can be well approximated as being massive points, thus implying the validity
of conventional and calculus.

On the contrary, there have been serious doubt dating back to E. Car-
tan on the same exact validity of the Riemannian geometry for interior
gravitational problem because the latter imply internal eﬀects which are
arbitrary nonlinear in the velocities and other variables, nonlocal integral
and of general non–(ﬁrst)–order Lagrangian type.

Santilli [221,222,224,223] constructed his isoriemannian geometry and

19

proposed the related isogravitation theory precisely to resolve the latter
shortcoming.
In fact, the isometric acquires an arbitrary functional; de-
pendence thus being able to represent directly the locally anisotropic and
inhomogeneous character of interior gravitational problems.

A remarkable aspect of the latter advances is that they were achieved
by preserving the abstract geometric axioms of the exterior gravitation.
In fact, exterior and interior gravitation are uniﬁed in the above geometric
approach and are merely diﬀerentiated by the selected unit, the trivial value
I = diag(1, 1, 1, 1) yielding the conventional gravitation in vacuum while
more general realization of the unit yield interior conditions under the same
abstract axioms (see ref. [129,130] for an independent study).

A number of applications of the isogeometries for interior problems have
already been identiﬁed, such as (see ref. [224] for an outline): the represen-
tation of the local variation of the speed of light within physical media such
as atmospheres or chromospheres; the representation of the large diﬀerence
between cosmological redshift between certain quasars and their associated
galaxies when physically connected according to spectroscopic evidence; the
initiation of the study of the origin of the gravitation via its identiﬁcation
with the ﬁeld originating the mass of elementary constituents.

As we have shown [269,261,254,270] the low energy limits of string and
superstring theories give also rise to models of (super)ﬁeld interactions with
locally anisotropic and even higher order anisotropic interactions. The N–
connection ﬁeld can be treated as a corresponding nonlinear gauge ﬁeld
managing the dynamics of ”step by step” splitting (reduction) of higher
dimensional spaces to lower dimensional ones. Such (super)string induced
(super)gravitational models have a generic local anisotropy and, in conse-
quence, a more sophisticate form of ﬁeld equations and conservation laws
and of corresponding theirs stochastic and quantum modiﬁcations. Per-
haps similar considerations are in right for isotopic versions of sting theo-
ries. That it is why we are interested in a study of models of isogravity
with nonvanishing nonlinear isoconnection, distinguished isotorsion and, in
general, non–isometric ﬁelds.

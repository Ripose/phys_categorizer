Abstract

It is by now standard knowledge that a major diﬃculty in incorporating Maxwell’s

equations of light propagation with First Relativity Postulate (FRP) was resolved by

Einstein when he invoked the Second Relativity Postulate (SRP), which states that the

speed of light in vacuum is a universal constant. While a primary goal of physics is to

explain phenomena with minimal assumptions, many previous attempts in formulating

a robust theory by using the FRP without the SRP inadvertantly involved additional

postulates or interpretations which are even more complicated. Here I describe how

Special Relativity is explained as a quantum measurement eﬀect, and is a consequence

of the FRP alone if one insists upon having the same set of physical laws for all inertial

observers, including the manner in which space and time are quantized. Two consequences

emerge: (a) the speed of light c has further meaning, it is the ratio of the length quantum

to the time quantum, which by the FRP must be the same for all observers; (b) the

minimum position and timing uncertainties experienced by an observer always appear to

be smaller than those of his ‘moving’ partner. This increase of uncertainties with motion

is the reason why measured distances and time intervals are not absolute. Moreover,

because the increase is accounted for precisely and simply by the quantum mechanics of

harmonic oscillators, this lends a posteriori credence to the basic premise of space-time

measurements being governed by intrinsic quantization.

2

In contemporary physics the FRP is usually viewed as a portrait of the complete

symmetry between inertial observers. Speciﬁcally all such observers experience the same

laws of physics[1]. This Postulate, though simply stated, is extremely powerful because

application of it to new physical principles could lead to important consequences. The

supreme example is when Maxwell’s equation of electromagnetic wave (i.e. light) propa-

gation ﬁnally became recognized as a universal law of nature. In order that the equation

be invariant with respect to all inertial frames, their coordinates cannot be related by the

Galilean transformation (which assumes space and time are absolute), but by the Lorentz

transformation[2]. A way of arriving at the latter simply and logically, as suggested by

Einstein[3], is to introduce a Second Relativity Postulate (hereafter SRP), which states

that the speed of light is a universal constant, independent not only of inertial frames,

but also the motion of the emission source in each frame. Thus, although Einstein did

fruitfully integrate Maxwell’s theory with the FRP, it was necessary for him to enlist a

separate postulate. Does this mean the statement of symmetry provided by the FRP,

though very elegant, only plays the role of compelling and guiding us to invoke further

postulates everytime we have to deal with a new physical law ?

Here I discuss another possibility, viz. that the reason why FRP appears insuﬃcient is

because, unlike Newton’s laws, neither Maxwell’s theory nor Einstein’s SRP have touched

upon the underlying physics in its primitive form. This physics is simply that micro-

scopically space and time are quantized: there exists a pair of independent and minimum

uncertainties in one’s ability to measure the coordinates (x, t) of an event, which are de-

noted by (xo, to), and which cannot be surpassed irrespective of an instrument’s accuracy.

3

When incorporated with the FRP, the Postulate reads: ‘all inertial observers experience

the same laws of physics, including the same limiting ability to measure positions and

times’. I shall investigate whether this will naturally lead to a unique set of frame trans-

formation equations, using the FRP alone. Before doing so, however, I designate the ratio

xo/to a universal constant vo which has the dimension of a speed.

Let us ﬁrst examine the Galilean transformation G. The event data of an inertial

observer Σ are, as above, (x ± xo, t ± to). How do these two measurements appear to

another observer Σ′ who moves relative to Σ with velocity v = (v, 0, 0) ? According to

G, Σ′ reads the output coordinates of the experiment aboard Σ as (x′ ± x′

o, t′ ± t′

o) where

x′ = x − vt, t′ = t; and x′

o, t′

o = to. Here one does not necessarily ﬁnd a

o = xoq1 + v2/v2

conﬂict with the FRP: frame transformations can, without changing the laws of physics,

alter the values of physical parameters, even expand (or contract) measurement scales.

The real diﬃculty, however, is the increase in the intrinsic positional uncertainty (xo

→

x′

o > xo) unaccompanied by a proportional increase in the limiting timing uncertainty

(to

→ t′

o = to); speciﬁcally one notices that the ratio xo/to changes from vo to v ′

o =

x′

o/t′

o = voq1 + v2/v2

o > vo, i.e. Σ′ did witness a fundamental result which is diﬀerent

in physical character from what he would have obtained had he performed the same

experiment aboard his own frame. Thus if space-time quantization is part of the basic

physics required by the FRP to remain the same for all inertial observers, G will indeed

be inconsistent with the FRP.

I proceed to seek a frame transformation which conserves the ratio xo/to = vo. I shall

provide full details of this derivation: since one is not allowed to make use of the fact

4

that vo is the propagation speed of a signal, the standard method can no longer be used.

We start with Σ and Σ′ having their spatial (cartesian) coordinate axes parallel to each

other, and common space-time origin. The homogeneity and isotropy of space-time, a

corollary of the FRP, immediately implies a linear relationship between the two sets of

4-D coordinates with y and z separated from the rest, i.e.

t′ = r(v)[t − s(v)x],

x′ = q(v)[x − p(v)t],

y ′ = y,

z′ = z

where the functions q, r, and s can depend only on v. By taking into account the fact

that an object stationary relative to Σ′ moves relative to Σ with speed v along +x, one

easily deduces p(v) = v, so that

t′ = r(v)[t − s(v)x],

x′ = q(v)(x − vt),

y ′ = y,

z′ = z

(1)

Next, since the combined operations r → r′, t → t′ and v → −v leave the situation

unchanged, and since q and r are positive deﬁnite scale factors which cannot be sensitive

to the sign of v (else there would be a preference between +x and −x), the inverse

transformation reads:

t = r(v)[t′ − s(−v)x′],

x = q(v)(x′ + vt′),

y = y ′,

z = z′

(2)

If in the x-transformation part of equ (1) one substitutes the expressions for x and t from

equ (2), and the result were to hold for all times, the coeﬃcient of t′ must vanish. This

5

means:

q(v) = r(v)

(3)

The second stage is to determine the functional forms of q and s. It is necessary to

repeat the thought experiment described earlier. If Σ measures the position and time of

an event to the unsurpassable accuracies (xo, to), observer Σ′ records the accuracies as:

′ 2

o = q2(v)x2
x

o 1 +

v2
v2

o! ;

′ 2
o = q2(v)t2
t

o(1 + s2v2
o)

(4)

The ratio x′ 2

o /t′2

o = v2

o(1 + v2/v2

o)/(1 + s2v2

o) must, if the FRP were to be satisﬁed, equate

to v2

o. Thus

s =

v
v2

o

.

(5)

By applying equ (5) to equs (1) through (3), one sees that in order to have a consistently

invertible transformation, q(v) assumes the form:

q(v) = vuut

and the full solution becomes:

1 − v

Equ (7) will be the Lorentz transformation L of Special Relativity if the ratio vo of the

length quantum to the time quantum is identiﬁed as the speed of light in vacuum, c:

vo = c

(8)

At this stage of the development two questions naturally arise. First is whether the new

approach is worthy of consideration given the tremendously successful theory of Einstein.

Note that the starting point more fundamental - the present treatment relies only on

the FRP once we accept the notion of space-time being quantized beyond some scale - a

notion which is certainly not foreign to our current understanding of microscopic physical

reality. It is sometimes said, however, that even Special Relativity can proceed without

the SRP, if the Maxwell’s equations are accepted as among those physical laws which

‘participate’ in the FRP, i.e., they must be experienced by all inertial observers in the

same way. The problem with such an argument, which is the reason why Einstein explicitly

invoked the SRP, is that Maxwell’s theory does not restrict us to a unique interpretation

in detail. For example, even if one abandons the ether concept, and thereby integrates

the electromagnetic wave equation with the FRP by insisting that all inertial observers

must measure wave-like behavior in the ﬁelds with the same propagation speed c, it is not

clear if, for a given observer, the equation is mindful of the state of motion of the emitting

source in this frame. This is evidently the cause for the confusion among the scientiﬁc

community in the years preceding Einstein’s 1905 paper. I should also remind the reader

that the demonstrated possibility of using the L to derive the Maxwell’s equations[4]

becomes very attractive if the former stems from independent and more basic ideas.

7

The second question is, on the supposition of a genuinely new and independent deriva-

tion of Special Relativity being presented here, does it play a mere pedagogical role ? A

crucial diﬀerence from Einstein’s theory exists, in that the current approach attributes

such relativistic eﬀects as length contraction to the apparent enlargement of quantum

uncertainties (in positioning and timing) associated with motion. Moreover, the enlarge-

ments are fully consistent with space-time being quantized like simple harmonic oscillators

(cf. black body radiation). To prove this extremely important point, we return to the

intrinsic uncertainties which observer Σ suﬀers from, viz. xo and to. Observer Σ′ notices

that his ‘moving’ partner Σ is in fact subject to higher uncertainties, viz. x′

o and t′

o as

given in equ (4), where the meaning of the various symbols used is to be found in equs

(5) through (8). I only examine x′

o, since the treatment of t′

o is analogous. Equ (4) may

be re-written as:

o = x2
x

When cast in the form of Equ (9), it is possible to secure a direct comparison with the

harmonic oscillator. Denoting the zero-point energy and oscillator constant by ǫ/2 and κ,

respectively, the minimum positional uncertainty of an oscillator is given by the ground

state with origin as equilibrium point, and is equal to qǫ/(2κ). This must at present

correspond to xo. Thus we have:

ǫ = 2κx2

o

(10)

The above is realized only at zero temperature. At higher temperatures T , x2

o increases to

x′ 2
o = x2

o(1+ < x2

1 > /x2

o), where < x2

1 > is the mean-square amplitude due to the excited

8

states, and is related to the mean energy of these states, ¯E = ǫe−

ǫ

kT /[1 − exp(−ǫ/kT )],

by κ < x2

1 >= ¯E. So we can write:

o = x2

Equs (9) and (11), when taken together, suggest strongly the following association:

v2
c2 = e−

ǫ

(11)

(12)

The two equations are then in exact agreement. Therefore the increase in measurement

inaccuracies of a moving observer follows precisely the ﬂuctuation enhancement of a ther-

mally agitated quantum oscillator. In this way, we bolster a posteriori the earlier premise

of space-time quantization. Moreover, there is now a clear rationale for assigning a tem-

perature to the space-time array of a moving observer[5]. Applications to the issues of

mass and gravitation will be discussed in a separate work[5].

To summarize, numerous experimental results point to the quantum nature of micro-

scopic physical reality. One can therefore expect that the structure of space-time beyond

certain scales is no exception. Yet because space-time forms the basic reference frame of

all inertial observers, such a quantization scheme must obey the FRP. The rest is logical

deduction, and we are led to two principal conclusions: (a) transformation of coordinates

between inertial frames takes the form of L, with the speed of light c interpreted as the

ratio of the length quantum to the time quantum; (b) Special Relativity is a manifesta-

tion of the manner in which motion aﬀects intrinsic capabilities in positioning and timing,

9

with the apparent increase in these two limiting measurement uncertainties of a moving

observer completely explained by applying to space-time the simplest quantization scheme

among all - that of a harmonic oscillator.

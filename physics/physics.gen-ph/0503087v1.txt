In order to control aggregation phenomena in suspensions of nanoparticles, one often charges the particles electri-
cally, e.g. by triboelectric charging. Stabilization of suspensions against aggregation of particles is an important
issue, which may be realized by monopolar charging,where particles repel each other. Contrarily, bipolar charging
may be used in coating processes, where smaller particles of one material coat larger particles of another material.
When the two particle fractions are charged oppositely, aggregation between equally charged particles is hindered
whereas aggregation between oppositely charged particles is preferred, thereby improving the coating process.
We study various aspects of these two situations by theoretical investigations and computer simulations.

INTRODUCTION

Granular materials play a major role in a large num-
ber of technological applications. The size of grains
used depends on the application, ranging from large
particles with diameters of several centimeters down
to nanoparticles. However, the physical properties of
powders change drastically when reaching the size of
nanoparticles. While in ordinary dry granular materi-
als contacts between the particles cannot sustain ten-
sile loads, in the case of ultra-ﬁne powders van der
Waals forces lead to aggregation which is essentially
irreversible. In contrast to volume forces such as grav-
ity, which decrease with decreasing particle radius a
like a3, van der Waals forces are proportional to a
and thus dominate all other forces in the case of suf-
ﬁciently small particles. On the other hand, van der
Waals forces are only short ranged, diverging like h−2
on very short distances and decaying like h−7 with
increasing distance h between the surface of parti-
cles (T. van de Ven 1989). Thus, the van der Waals
force can be approximated as an irreversible sticking
force, which has no inﬂuence on particles separated
from each other, but causes them to stick together ir-
reversibly, as soon as they touch each other.

A promising strategy to reduce agglomeration of
particles is to charge them electrically. If one man-
ages to charge all particles with the same polarity, the
mutual Coulomb repulsion delays or even suppresses
the aggregation process. It has been shown that such a

charge distribution can be established for particles sus-
pended in a non-polar liquid (J.H. Werth et al. 2003;
M. Linsenb¨uhler et al. 2005). In the ﬁrst part of this pa-
per we investigate to what extent charges can be used
to enhance the stability of a suspension against ag-
glomeration. We present some results obtained from
a rate equation investigation, recently published in
(S.M. Dammer & D.E. Wolf 2004).

In the second part of the paper, we present an appli-
cation which makes use of Coulomb forces: the coat-
ing of charged particles with sizes on the micrometer
scale by oppositely charged nanoparticles. As shown in
(M. Linsenb¨uhler & K.-E. Wirth 2004), such a coating
may enhance the ﬂowability of a powder dramatically,
since the nanoparticles on the particle surfaces act as
spacers between the micrometer sized particles, thus
reducing their mutual van der Waals forces. The aggre-
gation process of oppositely charged particles has been
studied in detail (J.H. Werth et al. 2005).

2 STABILIZATION AGAINST AGGLOMERA-

TION

Let us consider a very ﬁne suspended powder. The
size of the particles shall be a few µm or below. We
assume the particles to be all of the same insulating
material, each carrying an electric charge of the same
sign. The charged particles are subjected to Coulomb
and van der Waals forces as well as Brownian mo-
tion and Stokes friction. As already pointed out in

the introduction, van der Waals forces will only dom-
inate over Coulomb forces for particles very close to
each other. Thus we assume that the van der Waals
force has no effect except when particles collide and
stick together irreversibly. The motion of the particles
is then composed of a stochastic part due to Brow-
nian motion and a deterministic part determined by
the balance of repelling Coulomb forces and Stokes
friction (S.M. Dammer et al. 2004). It may happen that
particles (or agglomerates of particles) come into con-
tact due to Brownian motion, thus forming a new ag-
glomerate (Brownian coagulation). In the following we
will investigate this aggregation process in further de-
tail in terms of a rate equation approach.

We assume that initially the suspension consists of
primary particles or primary aggregates, all of the same
mass m∗, the same effective radius a∗, and carrying the
same charge q∗. As particles collide they form clusters
with increasing mass and charge. Since for the chosen
initial conditions mass and charge of the clusters are
proportional to each other, it is sufﬁcient to describe
them by a single index i according to

Here ni(t) denotes the number density of clusters with
mass mi=im∗ and radius ai=iαa∗ at time t, each of
them carrying the charge qi=iq∗, where 1/α denotes
the fractal dimension of the aggregates (e.g. α=1/3
for spherical particles). As initial condition we choose
n1(t=0)=1, ni(t=0)=0 for i>1 . The matrix Rij in
the rate equation is called coagulation kernel and de-
scribes at which rate two clusters with indices i and j
merge into a single one. For Brownian coagulation of
charged particles one has

(S.M. Dammer & D.E. Wolf 2004). Here κij is pro-
to the Coulomb energy of two clusters
portional
being in contact, divided by the thermal energy. This
Coulomb energy is necessary to bring two particles
into contact from inﬁnite separation. If the suspension
contains countercharges so that a double layer forms,
the Coulomb repulsion at short distances is combined
with attractive forces at intermediate distances. In this
case the activation energy for a particle collision can
be enhanced, i.e. the collision rate can be reduced
compared to Eq. (2).

mary particles. Fig. 1 shows the temporal evolution
of the average aggregate mass, obtained from a nu-
merical solution of the rate equations (1). As an ex-
ample, for an experimental situations with values like
η=10−4Pa s, T =300K, a∗=1µm and ˜n≈2·105mm−3
one ﬁnds t∗≈150s. Assuming ǫr≈1, charging with a
single elementary charge on each primary particle cor-
responds to a value k≈0.2. For these parameters one
ﬁnds with the dimensionless results of Fig. 1 that the
crossover to slow aggregation occurs within hours.

For times larger than tc the suspension is usu-
ally called stable. However, note that aggregation still
proceeds slowly. A consequence of this is that the
mass distribution evolves towards a universal scal-
ing form and that the relative width σr of the dis-
tribution falls off to a universal value σ∞
r ≈0.2017
that is much smaller than in the uncharged case (with
σr≈1) (S.M. Dammer & D.E. Wolf 2004). Hence, for
an initially narrow mass distribution σr ﬁrst grows sim-
ilarly to the uncharged situation until time tc, when
it starts decreasing again (induced by the exponential

suppression of further aggregation) which is denoted
as self-focusing. With the values of the example dis-
cussed above, this self-focusing effect occurs within an
experimentally accessible time.

3 COATING OF PARTICLES WITH NANOPARTI-

CLES

In this section we present an application which
makes use of charged granular particles in sus-
pension, namely the coating of powder parti-
cles with nanoparticles. As shown by experiments
(M. Linsenb¨uhler & K.-E. Wirth 2004), such a coat-
ing of powder particles, even by a small amount of
nanoparticles, leads to a strong increase in ﬂowability
and ﬂuidizability of powders.

A detailed description of the coating process can
be found in (J.H. Werth et al. 2003). Therefore, we
want to give only a brief description. During the pro-
cess, both the powder particles and the nanoparticles
are charged triboelectrically by stirring the suspension
with a high speed stirring device. By choosing dif-
ferent, electrically insulating materials for the pow-
der particles and the nanoparticles it is possible to
charge both fractions oppositely in a single process.
After the charging process is stopped, the suspension
is left untouched and the particles may agglomerate
with each other. Due to Coulomb forces, agglomera-
tion of oppositely charged particles (i.e. powder parti-
cles and nanoparticles) is preferred, while agglomera-
tion of equally charged particles is suppressed. Eventu-
ally, a dry powder of coated particles can be achieved
by evaporation of the liquid nitrogen.

An interesting question is, to what extent the charges
inﬂuence the deposition of the nanoparticles on the
larger powder grains. To this end, we expect
the
nanoparticles to usually carry only one single elemen-
tary charge, while the larger powder particles may
carry several elementary charges. Since the used mate-
rials are electric insulators, the elementary charges are
immobilized at distinct positions on the particle sur-
faces. If a nanoparticle now approaches the surface of
a larger particle, two situations may arise: it may touch
the particle exactly at the position of a charge, thereby
compensating this charge, or it may just touch on a ran-
dom position on the surface, leaving a dipole moment
interacting with more charged nanoparticles in the sus-
pension. The second case may occur due to Brownian
motion of the particles.

To answer the question, which situation is more
likely and to what extent surface charges of powder
particles are compensated by charged nanoparticles,
we study a simpliﬁed model: point-like particles, each
carrying one negative elementary charge, are conti-
nously inserted far away from one inﬁnitely large par-
ticle, represented by a ﬂat wall and carrying one or sev-
eral positive elementary charges. The point-like par-

ticles are subjected to Coulomb forces by interaction
with the charges on the wall, to Brownian motion and
to Stokes friction by the surrounding ﬂuid. Coulomb
interaction of equally charged particles among each
other is not regarded. As soon as a particle touches the
wall, it is removed from the system. Our aim is to com-
pute the probability distribution ρ(~r) for the particles to
touch the wall at position ~r.

The answer to this problem is given in detail in
(J.H. Werth et al. 2005). Therefore, here we only moti-
vate the according equations and present some results.
The probability distribution P (~r, t) to ﬁnd a particle at
point ~r and time t can be described by a Fokker-Planck
(FP) equation. It has the form

∂
∂t

P (~r, t) = −~∇ ·~j(~r, t) ,

(5)

where

~j(~r, t) = −D ~∇P (~r, t) + ~v(~r)P (~r, t)

(6)

is the probability current, D the diffusion constant, and

~v(~r) = −

24π2εε0ηar3 = −

Q
r2

~r

q2~r

(7)

is the particle velocity in the overdamped limit.

Measuring space in units of Q/D and time in units
of Q2/D3 we obtain the parameter-free dimensionless
equation

∂
∂t

P = ∇2P − ~∇P · ~u − P (~∇ · ~u)

(8)

where ~u = −~r/r3.

We are only interested in the distribution ρ(~r) of in-
coming particles at the wall. This allows us to use a
time independent FP equation. We arrive at the station-
ary FP equation

∇2P − ~∇P · ~u − P (~∇ · ~u) = 0.

(9)

Equation (9) can be solved analytically in the case
of one single charge ﬁxed at the wall. The analytical
solution as well as an in-depth derivation of (9) and a
numerical treatment of the according Langevin equa-
tion can be found in (J.H. Werth et al. 2005).

First we want to concentrate on the analytically solv-
able case of one single surface charge at the wall. The
density distribution ρ(r) of particles reaching the wall
in a distance r to the ﬁxed charge is given by

ρ(r) = 1 +

where the density of nanoparticles far away from the
wall is set to unity. There are three terms contribut-
ing to the density distribution: Firstly, there is a cer-
tain fraction of point particles which exactly reaches

where n is the number of charges ﬁxed at the wall.
This approximation agrees nicely with simulations, al-
though in the case of three and four charges the numer-
ical data lie slightly below the light curves.

4 CONCLUSION
We discussed suspensions of monopolarly and
bipolarly charged particles. In the former case, accu-
mulation of charges leads to a crossover from fast to
slow aggregation, followed by a self-focusing of the
mass distribution towards a universal scaling form.
In the latter case, we showed that bipolar charging
may enhance the coating of powder particles with
nanoparticles.

2 δ(r). Sec-
ondly, there is a concentration of particles around the
ﬁxed charge, decaying like 1/2r with growing distance
r to the ﬁxed charge. Finally, there is a constant back-
ground of incoming particles according to the density
of particles far away from the wall. Solution (10) pro-
vides no intrinsic length scale.

Moving from one single ﬁxed charge to several
charges distributed at the wall, there is no analytical
solution of equation (9) until now. Especially, the sum
of solutions of type (10) for several charges at different
positions is not a solution of the multi-charge Fokker-
Planck equation. However, as we will see, at least for
only a few charges, adding up the single charge solu-
tions can be a ﬁrst approximation for the real problem.
Since analytical solutions are not tangible, the di-
rect numerical simulation of a multi-charge Langevin
equation can be used to obtain results. The Langevin
equation describing the movement of a nanoparticle is
given by

where ~r is the position of the particle, ~FC(~r) is the
Coulomb force acting on it, η is the dynamic viscos-
ity of the ﬂuid, a the particle radius and ~ξ(t) is a white
Gaussian noise corresponding to Brownian motion of
the particle.

Fig. 2 shows densities of particle inﬂux at the wall
obtained numerically. In the simulations corresponding
to Figures 2 (a)-(d), up to four charges are arranged
in a line, separated by a distance of 2Q/D. The bold
curves show the density of particles touching the wall
along this line. The light curves are obtained by adding
up the 1/2r-shoulders from the single charge solution

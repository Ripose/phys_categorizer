Abstract

We provide a rationale for the Planck scale being the minimum
scale in the universe, as also its speciﬁc numerical values.
In the
process we answer the question of why the Planck scale is 1020 times
the Compton scale of elementary particles. These considerations show
how the Planck scale provides an underpinning for space time.

1 Introduction

In the latest approaches such as Quantum Superstrings (or M-Theory) or
Quantum Gravity Theories it is generally accepted that the Planck scale
deﬁnes a minimum scale for the universe [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In these schemes
10−5gms which is deﬁned
there is a maximal mass, the Planck mass mP ∼
by

10−33cms and
Using the value for mP we can deﬁne the Planck length lP ∼
10−42secs, which are the Compton lengths and times
the Planck time tP ∼
for the mass in (1). It may be mentioned that these values were postulated
by Planck himself. Today the values for the minimum scale as given in (1)
are taken for granted. We ﬁrst provide a rationale for the numerical value of
the Planck scale.

2 The Planck Scale

Our starting point is the model for the underpinning at the Planck scale for
the universe. This is a collection of N Planck scale oscillators (Cf.refs.[5, 6,
7, 8, 9] for details). We do not need to specﬁfy N. We have in this case the
following well known relations

R = √N l, Kl2 = kT,

=

ω2

(2)

max =

kT
ml2

K
m
In (2), R is of the order of the diameter of the universe, K is the analogue
of the spring constant, T is the eﬀective temperature while l is the analogue
of the Planck length, m the analogue of the Planck mass and ωmax is the
frequency-the reason for the subscript max will be seen below. We do not
yet give l and m their usual values as given in (1) for example, but rather
try to deduce these values.
We now use the well known result that the individual minimal oscillator
particles are black holes or mini universes as shown by Rosen [10]. So using
the well known Beckenstein temperature formula for these primordial black
holes [11], that is

kT =

¯hc3
8πGm

in (2) we get,

10−5gms. In deducing
We can easily verify that (3) leads to the value m
(3) we have used the typical expressions for the frequency as the inverse of
the time - the Compton time in this case and similarly the expression for the
Compton length. However it must be reiterated that no speciﬁc values for l
or m were considered in the deduction of (3).
We now make two interesting comments. Cercignani and co-workers have
shown [12, 13] that when the gravitational energy becomes of the order of
the electromagnetic energy in the case of the Zero Point oscillators, that is

∼

then this deﬁnes a threshold frequency ωmax above in which the oscillations
become chaotic.

are also bosonic oscillators, we deduce a maximal frequency given by

In (5) c is, in the particular case of phonons, the velocity of propagation,
that is the velocity of sound, whereas in our case this velocity is that of light.
Frequencies greater than ωmax in (5) are meaningless. We can easily verify
that (4) and (5) give back (3).
Finally we can see from (2) that, given the value of lP and using the value
of the radius of the universe, viz., R

1027, we can deduce that,

3 The Gauge Hierarchy Problem

∼

We next consider a long standing puzzle, the so called gauge hierarchy prob-
lem, that is why is there such a wide gap between the mass of a Planck
particle, 10−5gms and the mass of a typical elementary particle
10−25gms.
We show that the answer to this problem lies in a particular characteriza-
tion of gravitation. This moreover also provides a picture of a Planck scale
underpinning for the entire universe itself.
In 1997 the author put forward a model in which particles are created ﬂuctu-
ationally in a phase transition from the background Zero Point Field or Dark
Energy. This model lead to dramatic consequences: The Universe would
be accelerating and expanding with a small cosmological constant. Besides,
several longstanding puzzling relations of the so called large number genre
which had no explanation whatsoever, were now deduceable from the theory.
At that time the accepted Standard Big Bang model predicted a dark matter
ﬁlled decelerating universe–in other words the exact opposite. In 1998 how-
ever the ﬁrst results were announced by Perlmutter, Kirshner and coworkers,
from a study of distant supernovae that the universe was indeed accelerating
and expanding with a small cosmological constant, contrary to belief. These
conclusions were subsequently reconﬁrmed several times. This work was the
breakthrough of the year 1998 of the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science [16] while Dark Energy itself was subsequently conﬁrmed
through the WMAP and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This in fact was the

3

breakthrough of the year 2003 [17].
To recapitulate the author’s model [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 7], we give a simple
picture and will return to the nuances later.
Our starting point is the all permeating Zero Point Field or the Dark En-
ergy, from which the elementary particles are created. As Wheeler put it [24],
“From the zero-point ﬂuctuations of a single oscillator to the ﬂuctuations of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld to geometrodynamic ﬂuctuations is a natural order
of progression...”
Let us consider, following Wheeler a harmonic oscillator in its ground state.
The probability amplitude is

for displacement by the distance x from its position of classical equilibrium.
So the oscillator ﬂuctuates over an interval

ψ(x) =

1/4

mω
π¯h (cid:19)

(cid:18)

e−(mω/2¯h)x2

∆x

(¯h/mω)1/2

∼

The electromagnetic ﬁeld is an inﬁnite collection of independent oscillators,
with amplitudes X1, X2 etc. The probability for the various oscillators to
have emplitudes X1, X2 and so on is the product of individual oscillator
amplitudes:

ψ(X1, X2,

) = exp[

(X 2

1 + X 2

2 +

· · ·

−

)]

· · ·

wherein there would be a suitable normalization factor. This expression gives
the probability amplitude ψ for a conﬁguration B(x, y, z) of the magnetic ﬁeld
that is described by the Fourier coeﬃcients X1, X2,
or directly in terms
of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration itself by

P being a normalization factor. Let us consider a conﬁguration where the
magnetic ﬁeld is everywhere zero except in a region of dimension l, where it

is of the order of

So the energy of ﬂuctuation in a region of length l is given by ﬁnally [24, 25,
26]

∼
In the above if l is taken to be the Compton wavelength of a typical elemen-
tary particle, then we recover its energy mc2, as can be easily veriﬁed.
It may be mentioned that Einstein himself had believed that the electron
was a result of such a condensation from the background electromagnetic
ﬁeld (Cf.[27, 23] for details). We will return to this point again. We also
take the pion to represent a typical elementary particle, as in the literature.

To proceed, as there are N

1080 such particles in the universe, we get

∼

Nm = M

where M is the mass of the universe.

In the following we will use N as the sole cosmological parameter.

Equating the gravitational potential energy of the pion in a three dimen-
sional isotropic sphere of pions of radius R, the radius of the universe, with
the rest energy of the pion, we can deduce the well known relation [21, 28, 29]

where M can be obtained from (7).

R

We now use the fact that given N particles, the ﬂuctuation in the particle
number is of the order √N[29, 14, 19, 20, 30, 18], while a typical time interval
¯h/mc2, the Compton time. We will come back to this
for the ﬂuctuations is
point later in the context of the minimum Planck scale: Particles are created
and destroyed - but the ultimate result is that √N particles are created. So
we have, as we saw brieﬂy earlier,

tinuum region),

We can easily verify that the equation is indeed satisﬁed where T is the age
of the universe. Next by diﬀerentiating (8) with respect to t we get

where H in (11) can be identiﬁed with the Hubble Constant, and using (8)
is given by,

Equation (7), (8) and (10) show that in this formulation, the correct mass,
radius, Hubble constant and age of the universe can be deduced given N as
the sole cosmological or large scale parameter. Equation (12) can be written

Equation (13) has been empirically known as an ”accidental” or ”mysteri-
it relates
ous” relation. As observed by Weinberg[31], this is unexplained:
a single cosmological parameter H to constants from microphysics. We will
touch upon this micro-macro nexus again. In our formulation, equation (13)
is no longer a mysterious coincidence but rather a consequence.

As (12) and (11) are not exact equations but rather, order of magnitude
relations, it follows, on diﬀerentiating (11) that a small cosmological constant

is allowed such that

∧

< 0(H 2)

This is consistent with observation and shows that
is very small – this
has been a puzzle, the so called cosmological constant problem alluded to,
because in conventional theory, it turns out to be huge [32]. Some 1070 times
higher in fact! But it poses no problem in this formulation.

∧

To proceed we observe that because of the ﬂuctuation of

√N (due to
the ZPF), there is an excess electrical potential energy of the electron, which
infact we have identiﬁed as its inertial energy. That is [19, 29],

On using (8) in the above, we recover the well known Gravitation-electromagnetism
ratio viz.,

or without using (8), we get, instead, the well known so called Weyl-Eddington
formula,

(It appears that this was ﬁrst noticed by H. Weyl [33]). Infact (15) is the
spatial counterpart of (10). If we combine (15) and (2), we get,

where in (16), we have used (10). Following Dirac (cf.also [34]) we treat G as
the variable, rather than the quantities m, l, c and ¯h (which we will call micro
physical constants) because of their central role in atomic (and sub atomic)
physics.
Next if we use G from (16) in (12), we can see that

Thus apart from the fact that H has the same inverse time dependance on
T as G, (17) shows that given the microphysical constants, and N, we can
deduce the Hubble Constant also, as from (17) or (12).
Using (7) and (8), we can now deduce that

Next (15) and (10) give,

(18) and (19) are consistent with observation.
With regard to the time variation of G, the issue is debatable and model
dependent. Measurements on the earth and of the planets, and perhaps
10−10, though values 10−11
most accurate of all, Pulsars indicates a value
and 10−12 have also appeared in some studies [35, 36].
We return to the question of why the Planck mass is some 1020 times the
mass of an elementary particle, for example pions or Protons or Electrons

It is well known that the Planck mass is deﬁned by (1) [24, 23] Alternatively
the Planck mass deﬁnes a black hole having the Schwarzchild radius given

In (20) lP is the Planck length.
While mP is

10−25gms. (As mentioned in this order of magnitude sense it does not make
much diﬀerence, if the elementary particle is an electron or pion or proton
(Cf.ref.[24])).
We now recall that as already shown we have [19, 20, 37, 7]

∼

1080 is the well known number of elementary particles in the
In (21) N
universe, which features in the Weyl-Eddington relations as also the Dirac
Cosmology.
What is interesting about (21) is that it shows gravitation as a distributional
eﬀect over all the N particles in the universe [37, 7].
Let us rewrite (20) in the form

remembering that the Planck length is also the Compton length of the Planck
mass. (Interestingly an equation like (20) or (22) also follows from Sakharov’s
treatment of gravitation [38].) A division of (3) and (22) yields

1020 between the Planck mass

Equation (23) immediately gives the ratio
and the mass of an elementary particle.
It is interesting that in (21) if we take N
1, then we recover (22). So
while the Planck mass in the spirit of Rosen’s isolated universe and the
Schwarzchild black hole uses the gravitational interaction in isolation, as seen
from (21), elementary particles are involved in the gravitational interaction
with all the remaining particles in the universe.

Equation (24) is the otherwise empirically well known electromagnetism-
gravitation coupling constant ratio, but here it is deduced from the theory.
It may be remarked that one could attempt an explanation of (23) from the
point of view of SuperSymmetry or Brane theory, but these latter have as
yet no experimental validation [39].

4 The Universe as Planck Oscillators

What we have tried to argue is that a typical elementary particle like a
1040 evanescent Planck
pion could be considered to be the result of n
scale particles. The argument was based on random motions and also on the
modiﬁcation to the Uncertainity Principle. We will now consider the problem
from a diﬀerent point of view, which not only reconﬁrms the above result,
but also enables an elegant extension to the case of the entire universe itself.
Let us consider an array of N particles, spaced a distance ∆x apart, which
behave like oscillators, that is as if they were connected by springs. We then
have as seen

∼

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, r the extent and k
is the spring constant given by

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

We now identify the particles with Planck masses, set ∆x
a = lP , the
Planck length. It may be immediately observed that use of (27) and (26)
mP c2, which ofcourse agrees with the temperature of a black
gives kBT
hole of Planck mass. Indeed, as noted, Rosen had shown that a Planck mass

particle at the Planck scale can be considered to be a universe in itself. We
also use the fact alluded to that a typical elementary particle like the pion can
1040 Planck masses. Using this in (25),
be considered to be the result of n
l, the pion Compton wavelength as required. Further, in this latter
we get r
1040, and (26),i.e. kBT = kl2/N
case, using (48) and the fact that N = n
and (27) and (28), we get for a pion, remembering that m2

∼

∼

P /n = m2,

kBT =

¯h2 = mc2,

which of course is the well known formula for the Hagedorn temperature for
elementary particles like pions. In other words, this conﬁrms the conclusions
in the previous section, that we can treat an elementary particle as a series
of some 1040 Planck mass oscillators. However it must be observed from
(26) and (27), that while the Planck mass gives the highest energy state, an
elementary particle like the pion is in the lowest energy state. This explains
why we encounter elementary particles, rather than Planck mass particles in
nature. Infact as already noted [23], a Planck mass particle decays via the
10−42secs. On the other hand,
Bekenstein radiation within a Planck time
the lifetime of an elementary particle would be very much higher.
In any case the eﬃcacy of our above oscillator model can be seen by the
fact that we recover correctly the masses and Compton scales in the order of
magnitude sense and also get the correct Bekenstein and Hagedorn formulas
as seen above, and get the correct estimate of the mass of the universe itself,
as will be seen below.
1080 elementary particles
Using the fact that the universe consists of N
like the pions, the question is, can we think of the universe as a collection of
nN or 10120 Planck mass oscillators? We directly deduced this value a little
earlier, in fact. This is what we will now show. Infact if we use equation (25)
with

which gives the correct mass M, of the universe which in contrast to the
earlier pion case, is the highest energy state while the Planck oscillators in-
dividually are this time the lowest in this description. In other words the

10

universe itself can be considered to be described in terms of normal modes
of Planck scale oscillators.
The above gives a rationale for the ﬁgure 10120 Planck oscillators which is
derived from the observed 1080 elementary particles in the universe and con-
siderations in Section 2.
3. In fact it has already been shown that the universe has been considered
to be a coherent state of N ′ Planck oscillators, where M is given by (6). In
fact if we use (2) we can deduce that

Further, using considerations in point 2 we can also deduce that

M = √N ′mP

m = mP /√n

l = lP √n

τ = τP √n

(30)

(31)

where m, l, τ are the mass, the Compton wavelength and Compton time of
a typical elementary particle like the pion. This brings us to the question:
While the Planck scale may provide the underpinning, in real life it is the
Compton scale of elementary particles that we encounter. How do we make
this transition. We consider below some other approaches.

5 Other Approaches

1. It is well known that the energy of the Zero Point Field is given by

(∆B)2

¯hc/L4

≥
If in (32) L the extent over which the energy is spread, is taken to be the
Compton wavelength, we recover the mass of the elementary particle. Al-
ternatively it is known that the spectral density of the vacuum ﬁeld is given
by

(32)

(33)

ρ(ω) = const.ω3

where Lorentz invariance requires that the constant is given by

¯h
2π2c3

11

In conventional theory this leads to an unacceptably high energy density of
1015gms per cm3, but at the Compton wavelength, we get back the above
result.
2. In a similar vein, we can argue that when the Zero Point Field is taken into
account, at the Compton wavelength scale the momentum coordinate com-
mutators which otherwise vanish in Classical Theory go over to the Quantum
Mechanical commutators [42]. From this point of view the Zero Point Field,
as argued by some protogonists of Stochastic Electrodynamics, gives rise to
Quantum behavior.
3. What we have seen above is that from the background Zero Point Field,
Plank scale oscillators condense out. Let us suppose that n such particles are
formed. We can then use the well known fact that for a collection of ultra
relativistic particles, in this case the Planck oscillators, the various centres
of mass form a two dimensional disk of radius l given by

m in the large number sense) is the electron mass and β
where in (34) me(
is the angular momentum of the system. Further l is such that for distances
r < l, we encounter negative energies (exactly as for the Compton length).
It will at once be apparent that for an electron, for which β = ¯h
2 , (34) gives
the Compton wavelength. We can further characterize (34) as follows: By
the deﬁnition of the angular momentum of the system of Planck particles
moving with relativistic speeds, we have

In (35) we have used the fact that the disk of mass centres is two dimensional,
and σ has been inserted to stress the fact that we are dealing with a two
dimensional density, so that σ while being unity has the dimension

The right side of (35) gives the angular momentum for the electron. From
(35) we get

σl2mP = me

(36)

which ofcourse is correct.
Alternatively from (36) we can recover n

1040, in the large number sense.

the Planck scale.

6 Concluding Remarks

The universe which we encounter is at the Compton scale of elementary par-
ticles. The various elementary particles which constitute the universe are in
a sense incoherent in that they can be treated as independent particles which
are not coupled or linked. Yet they occupy a single space time, remembering
that at large distances the various particles interact via the relatively weak
force of gravitation. This is expressed by the relation

M = Nm,

where N is the number of particles in the universe and m a typical elemen-
tary particle mass, M being the mass of the universe.
However at a higher energy or smaller scale of observation, viz., the Planck
scale, the universe is seen as coherent collection of N ′
10120 Planck oscil-
lators, which in fact provides the underpinning for all of space time. In this
case we have,

∼

M = √N ′mP
where we are now speaking of the Planck mass. As described elsewhere
(Cf.refs.[7, 8]), we can describe the above diﬀerence in the following manner:
The most fundamental scale is the Planck scale, represened by wave functions
ψı. However by the Random Phase axiom, the superposition of the ψıs
reduces to the simpler superposition of φıs, these latter representing the
wave functions at the Compton scale of elementary particles.

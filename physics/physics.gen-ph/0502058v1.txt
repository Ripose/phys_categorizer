Abstract

A number theoretic algorithm is given for writing gauge theory amplitudes in
a compact manner. It is possible to write down all details of the complete L loop
amplitude with two integers, or a complex integer. However, a more symmetric
notation requires more integers, ﬁve or seven, depending on the type of theory. It is
possible that in the symmetric form (or in the non-symmetric form) that a direct (or
less direct) recursive algorithm or generating function can be developed to compute
these numbers at arbitrary loop order. The existence of this function is implied by
the recursive structure of loop amplitudes and their analyticity, i.e. multi-particle
poles; a function requiring a ﬁnite number of computations such as a polynomial
with derivable coeﬃcients is desired.

The computation of gauge theory amplitudes has been preoccupying modern
researchers for years, and due to the complexity, requires many tedious calculations
by conventional methods. Alternative and more eﬃcient methods for computing these
amplitudes are merited. Current well used methods include string-inspired methods,
unitarity and factorization conditions, spinor helicity and color decomposition, and
the recent Calabi-Yau/gauge theory weak-weak duality correspondence pertaining to
deformations of MHV amplitudes. These techniques have been useful in computing
tree and one-loop gauge theory amplitudes.

The derivation of the quantum amplitudes in the derivative expansion are pre-

sented in [1]-[11].

In this letter, a notation is given so that the typically complicated kinematic
expressions for loop amplitudes may be shortened to a few lines. These formulae, in
spinor notation, usually require a dozen pages to write down for the known one-loop
amplitudes; a few lines is a major improvement in notation. A few lines of inte-
gers is convenient for many reasons, including computational ones that are typically
performed for relevant cross section calculations.

The analytic pieces of the amplitudes are considered in this work. A modiﬁcation
of the notation can be made to include general products of polylogarithms which arise
at multi-loop. Also, these non-analytic terms are redundant in the sense that they
are derivable via perturbative unitarity.

The amplitudes are to be constructed from a small set of integers. The integers
required to specify the amplitude consist of : (1) two in order to specify the spinor
products hiji in the numerator and denominator via a series of n equations and m
unknowns, required for each term in the expansion at a given loop order, (2) one to
label the internal group quantum numbers, (3) one to label the particle spin numbers
including line factors, (4) one to describe the coeﬃcient.

In order to specify a gauge theory amplitude the numbers pertaining the kine-
matics and quantum numbers pertaining to the n particle states must be described.
The kinematics are associated in spinor helicity notation via,

(X[σ(i)˜σ(j)])p ,

where p is a number labeling the exponent of the term. For example, an individual
term in the amplitude may contain the factors,

(1)

(2)

[34]

([12] + [48] + [49])−2 .

The amplitude contains a series of these factors in one of the additive terms. For
an individual term in an n-particle amplitude, there are many factors, which may be
described in polynomial form via

X xσ(i)y˜σ(i) + |p| = 0 ,

with the vectors σ and ˜σ describing the indices in the inner products. For example,
the two terms in (3) are described by,

x1y2 + 1 = 0 ,

and

x1y2 + x4y8 + x4y9 + 2 = 0 ,

with another minus sign required for the 2 in (5). A minus sign is required in the last
term in the sum; the minus sign is speciﬁed by ordering the ﬁrst term in the series
via i < j in xiyj for min(i), with min(j) pertaining to the min(i). The information
in the series is grouped into a larger number N via another base q expansion. The
inner products are described via the expansion,

N = αx2 + βx + γ .

The numbers α and β in a well-ordered polynomial form are,

α =

σ(i)xi+1

β =

˜σ(i)xi+1 ,

and γ is an a priori arbitrary integer specifying the power The numbers α and β range
in base n up to the maximum value nn+2, with the coeﬃcients σ(i) and ˜σ(i) ranging
from 1 to n. To uniquely specify the kinematic factor, a number N is required which
must be written in base nn+2 + 1 ranging up to

(3)

N = 0, . . . , (nn+2 + 1)3 .

The condition in (8) is satisﬁed for q less than the maximum number. Otherwise, a
larger base is required; If for some reason q is larger than Nmax, which for n = 10
is approximately 1036 (a large pole), then a bound is required for the amplitude,
qmax, and the base qmax is used. (This bound depends on the number of terms in
the additive expansion of the amplitude; it may proved by a partial expanson of the
denominators and the multi-particle pole information. The assumption that qmax is
less than that in (8) is used.)

This number N is enough to specify one of the kinematic factors in one term of
the amplitude’s additive expansion. The speciﬁcation of a complete term requires
m factors, which is found via another (superseding) decomposition via a polynomial
with numbers labeling the factors,

X aiwi.

(9)

Assuming the maximum factor qmax, and m terms, the polynomial is speciﬁed in base
Nmax via a number Ni, for the ith term, bounded by N m+1
max .

The full expression describing the amplitude requires a series of these numbers
Nt, with each number parameterizing a single additive term. Given the three integers,
qmax, the number of terms Nterms, and the maximum number Nmax required to specify
a term (at a given order), a number Q and P is used via another base reduction to
specify the terms, i.e. Q = P aixi in base P . The kinematics is speciﬁed by the pair
(Q, P ). The bound on the number is N Nterms
. The complex brackets, i.e. hiji, are
speciﬁed by two more additional numbers ¯P and ¯Q.

max

The remaining numbers required to specify the amplitude are the prefactors of

the individual terms and the particles’ quantum numbers.

The helicity states in pure gauge theory are described by a vector (±1, . . . , ±1),
which may be written in base 2 with expansion of 0 → 1 and 1 → −1. The number
required is one from 0 to 2n, via P

n−1 aixi.

The group theory quantum numbers are described by another number with a
similar decomposition. Consider U(m) with m2 generators. The generators of the
particle states are parameterized by a mode expansion,

m2−1
X bixi ,

with bi a label ranging from 1 to m2. The number is one from 1 to m2, which requires
a number of maximum NR = (m2)m2
. The multiple trace structure, in which there
are L + 1 traces as in,

Tr

ordered via the particles in a permuted set, for example as ρ = (1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 5, 7, 6, 8),
is described by the integers from 0 to L (or 1 to L + 1) as in,

(0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1) ,

where the entry is the jth particle, and the entry directs the matrix to the appropriate
trace. The color decomposition is well-known, and there are L + 1 trace structures at
loop order L. The vector is parameterized by a number in base n with entries 0 to L
as in NT = P cixi. There are a maximum of p trace structures, and the number NT
ranges from 0 to Ln.

The prefactors of the individual terms gl,a require factors of rational numbers,
powers of π with products of euler-mascheroni constant. There are also divergences,
such as 1/ǫn. These numbers may also be encoded in superseded numbers.

The ﬁve numbers P + iQ, ¯P + i ¯Q, NS, NG, and NR together with the prefactors
label the amplitude at a given loop order L and set of quantum numbers. The lowest
number of terms at this order is labeled at NL(NS, NG, NR); this number is a lower
bound on the additive complexity. There are NL prefactors, GL,a.

Another form of the terms of the amplitude is simply to express the amplitude

as a polynomial directly in terms of the variables x, y and z. The terms

in the product are expressed as terms in the polynomial via

αij[ij])p

(X
i<j

Pj(z) = pjzj X
a<b

αabxayb ,

with the αij representing the sign of the inner products [ij] with i < j, and pj the
exponent of the sum. The polynomial form, as a function of x, y and z may be useful
in diﬀerential equation applications. The polynomial is

which has an ordering ambiguity in the coeﬃcients zi removed by relations between
multi-point and multi-genus amplitudes such as factorization. The polynomials have
an interpretation in a six-dimensional algebraic variety (and associated polyhedra);
this is possibly related to the Calabi-Yau/gauge theory twistor duality at tree level,
or to a diﬀerential equation at n-point and loop l generating the polynomial.

The notational complexity is much simpler than writing the full amplitude. A
typical amplitude at one-loop with six external legs may require several pages to write
on paper, whereas, perhaps only a few hundred digits are required.

With these numbers, the natural question is how to iterate the numbers from
one order in the loop expansion to the next. A number of the order of 101000 is an
approximate guess. The functional bootstrap from a set of numbers at L loop order
for a given set of quantum numbers seems possible via analyticity requirements in the
general case. The mathematical derivation of the iteration is quite interesting, if a
ﬁnite equation or recursive approach can be given; that is, not a set of inﬁnite degree
polynomials that label all of the numbers at various loop orders L, and requiring the
solutions apriori to determine the coeﬃcients.

An example would be a set of polynomial equations of ﬁnite degree in the variables
P + iQ, ¯P + i ¯Q, NS, NG, NR with L and NL, or a generating function with a ﬁnite
number of initial conditions. Given these numbers, the coeﬃcients GL,a also can be
deduced via multi-loop factorization on intermediate poles.

The generalization to further theories is direct. The spin reps are generalized
to the numbers (s1, s2, . . . , sn), and are grouped into a single integer. There are no
further numbers required in the multiplet description.

Known amplitude examples may be used to investigate the patterns in the num-
bers. Also, at one-loop the multi-trace subamplitudes are redundant and can be
expressed in terms of the leading trace ones; this property should have a number
theoretic description.

are a simple gauge theory to investigate in this context (likewise for self-dual grav-
ity). The amplitudes in (16) are maximally compressed, and independent of the
non-abelian group. The kinematics is independent of NG and NR, as well as the
helicity conﬁguration NS. The simple integrability could manifest in a more direct
fashion on the numbers (P + iQ, ¯P + i ¯Q).

There are further equivalent representations of the amplitudes in terms of integers.
There could also be some polynomial (knot) arithmetic associated with the numbers
[15] and their relations.

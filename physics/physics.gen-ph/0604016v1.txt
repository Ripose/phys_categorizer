Abstract

The solution term by term to the scattering of all consistent string theories is
given. The moduli space of M-theory is derived and connects the various string
theories. The solutions contain both the perturbative and non-perturbative sectors
of the string. Modular forms found by diﬀerential equations on subspaces of the
M-theory moduli space and transﬁnite algebras play an essential role in deriving
the coeﬃcients. Various results and identities in algebra are found from the explicit
solution. Archetypes and models are presented in accord with phenomenology and
cosmology.

I. Introduction

String theories in various dimensions have apparently been uniﬁed with an un-
derlying structure, which arises from M-theory [1], [2]. The known ﬁve consistent
string theories are Heterotic, IIB, IIA, I, and Spin(32), although there is no complete
classiﬁcation until now. The manifestation of the symmetries of M-theory, in con-
junction with the basic principles of scattering, are used in this work to construct the
full S-matrix solution to these ﬁve superstring theories in addition to an (unexpected)
ﬁve more.

The full M-theory moduli space has not been presented in the literature. Neither
has the full solution to the string scattering, including the ghost sector. The full so-
lution means, as a power series expansion in α′, every prefactor is a non-perturbative
function of the string model speciﬁc couplings. In this work the moduli space and the
non-perturbative scatterings are given, and with relatively simple diﬀerential equa-
tions the latter are deﬁned and can be solved. The symmetries and the dualities of
the various superstrings are both listed and manifested.

II. S-Matrices and Eﬀective Actions

The S-matrix in perturbative string theory is deﬁned formally in a couple of ways.
One can use the path integral and its world-sheet action, and by gauge ﬁxing all of the
extraneous degrees of freedom sum over inequivalent random 2-d Riemann surfaces.
The amplitudes are deﬁned as the sum of these punctured surfaces with wavefunction
overlaps provided by the set of vertex operators, which are in 1-to-1 correspondence
with the physical states. The gauge ﬁxing separates into several well known methods
such as light-cone, but the integrals are very complicated to evaluate by hand.

In recent years an altered expansion has been developed, which is very compatible
with the dualities in M-theory. The derivative expansion takes the form of the S-
matrix and expands it as a power series in the number of derivatives and operators
most of possess varying dimension. This is not a string coupling expansion; the ﬁeld
theory form of the expansion can be obtained in [4]-[12], and the string form can be
found in [13]-[19], with some overlap between the two. However, every order in α′ is
explicitly non-perturbative in the string coupling. As α′ does not transform under
S-duality, the expansion is suitable to manifest the duality structures of the string(s).
This expansion has been explicitly checked, to ﬁnd out if there was anything wrong
with S-duality without a trace. Supersymmetry and S-duality have been presumed
independent, which is clearly not true in accord with this work and prior work. The

2

3R4 and lower orders have been generally investigated together with a few special
2R4 term [13], [20]-[27],[37]. Subtle issues in the
series, and to genus two with the
genus expansion have been checked oﬀ as compatible with S-duality [28]-[36]. These
calculations can show mechanisms for cancellations in the maximally supersymmetric
IIB theory and were necessary to show the consistency of S-duality with the string
and its low-energy limit. In the form of maximally extended supergravity deﬁned in
ﬁeld theory there are implications for extended ﬁniteness properties [13]-[14][38]-[39].

Consider the graviton scattering in IIB superstring. Its expansion is, in Einstein

frame,

which is power series without end in the number of derivatives. The gravitational
portion is shown, but with supersymmetry and the higher order terms, including the
tensor structure the functional is complete.

Formally,

S =

Z √g

α′−3+2jfj Oj ,

with
Oj spanning the basis of operators, which depends speciﬁcally on the particular
superstring theory and its compactiﬁcation including ﬂuxes. The derivative form is
also useful in the background ﬁeld expansion as exempleﬁed in the holographic cor-
respondence. Determination of the functions fj then ’solve’ the string theory, apart
from resummations which may be very relevant in certain energy regimes. Resum-
mations also are expected to show the stringiness of the individual string ﬁelds such
as the graviton gµν, but from the target space-time point of view.

The expansion in (2) is perturbative, but in the string scale α′. Variations of the
action with respect to the fundamental string ﬁelds generate the on-shell S-matrix.
Furthermore, ghost string ﬁelds may be included in the operator content. In this work,
the coeﬃcients fj are determined based on symmetries of transﬁniteness and also the
M-theory moduli space. These coeﬃcients, which are functions in the couplings, are
determined a speciﬁed and non-trivial diﬀerential equation, and the functions fj are
related from one superstring theory to another.

III. Transﬁnite Algebra and Representations

3

The aﬃne group transformations appear in the string in a variety of ways. First,
they generate the modular subgroup of the Virasoro algebra on the world-sheet. Sec-
ond, the target space conformal representations is expected to relate to the world-
sheet Virasoro due to the conformal and Virasoro mapping. Third, there is reason
to believe that the transﬁniteness is related to the integrability in non-trivial curved
backgrounds such as when black holes are present. For these reasons, transﬁnite
groups and their actions are important to use and to clarify their role. Their use
in this work involved representation content primarily, without the full group and
dynamical implications. There are also powerful connections in mathematics, such as
in algebra, diﬀerential forms and speciﬁcally equations, and number theory, with the
transﬁnite algebra and its interwoven fabric in the full string scattering; this is not
explored here for brevity.

The aﬃne transﬁnite algebra Lα

a,b is characterized by the operations,

[La, Lb] = Lc + αδa=bLa ,

with the Poisson-Lie commutator

in which the sum generating the I ranges from minus inﬁnity to inﬁnity, which is a bit
non-standard. There is a map that may be used to switch between the two labelings.

In the various string theories the components of the representations are the var-
ious operators found by taking various products of the ﬁelds. For example, the op-
O1 = R4 which is a product of 8 Weyl tensors with a speciﬁc contraction,
erators
O2 = ψ4 the product of four fermions such as gravitinos. The appropriate sum
or
of representations span the full basis to the analytic part of the eﬀective action after
completely supersymmetrizing the elements. The commutator structure is realized as
a direct product of the two operators, that is, when the operators are labeled at the
same point. There are special representations that span the basis of the non-analytic
operators, such as those required by unitarity; string theory constructs can be used
to construct these.

The S-matrix is found by superimposing all of these terms, together with the

supersymmetric extension, in the form

S =

The Lα=1
ai,bi is labeled by the set of integers from i = 1, . . . , NR, the number of repre-
sentations. The representations are labeled by the indices ai and bi. The transﬁnite
representation that spans the ghost sector allows the action to be taken oﬀ-shell, with
an unambiguous oﬀ-shell prescription.

IV. Manifestation of Transﬁnite Symmetries

The appearance of the transﬁniteness of the string scattering is not appearant in

perturbation theory.

Consider the following S-matrix as an element in the algebra, with generator,

The generators correspond to conformal maps on the complex plane. The S-matrix
then is a generator of conformal maps, including curves.

V. Moduli Space of the M-theory Web

The moduli space of the M-theory vacua is a fundamental space on and through
which dualities act. These transformations through actions on the moduli space
transform the various string theories into eachother. For example, in the IIB sector
there is S-duality which requires the group SL(2, Z) = SL(2, R)/Z acting on a torus.
This torus is larger in general, and the space follows essentially from the quantization
of the various string theories.

Alternatively, determination of the moduli space a priori allows the various string
theories to be interconnected, and solved for, in terms of the transﬁnite representa-
tions and modular solutions to a diﬀerential equation acting on a sector of the moduli
space. The latter two quantities are the coeﬃcients αn and
Qs, which are an inte-
ger and a modular form of a particular weight. Both of which are found from the
moduli space and multiply the operator content of the representations involved in the
individual string scattering. Thus,

S =

Z √g

αnQsLα=1

ai,bi

X

(11)

with n and s proportional depending on the theory and funtions of the parameter
labeling the elements in the representation Lα=1
a,b .

The basic elements of the M-theory moduli space are as follows:

1) a torus with mapping class group SL(2, R)/Z (or SL(2, R)/Zp)

2) a circle S1 with group U(1) that models the eleventh dimension

3) two branched covers of the torus so that a pair of elliptic genus three surfaces

are constructed with the moduli possibly ﬁxed.

4) a branched cover of a unit S3 with unramiﬁed points, i.e. a S3 with one point
removed or the space R3; this is not part of the moduli space but rather used in

6

satisfying a unimodular condition with the points. The points may be resolved or
blown up to construct the spaces in 1) to 3).

The spaces in 1) to 3) make up the the moduli space from which the couplings
τ = τ1 + iτ2 are found; the gauge coupling is roughly the square root of the grav-
itational coupling required by modular invariance or (anti-) holomorphicity. They

ﬁbers; for example the S1 is a non-trivial ﬁber around the T 2 and the two elliptic
surfaces are oriented in a diameterically opposite fashion and are ﬁbered non-trivially
over the S3 in a disc like fashion involving only two coordinates. The disc-like fashion
follows from one dimension oriented along the τ2 direction and another dimension
along a non-intersecting path in (S1, τ1), both directions of which have periodicity.
The path in S3 is non-trivial because the S1 has a non-trivial ﬁber over the entire T 2.

The construction of the moduli space begins with 12 points on a unit n-sphere
embedded in 13 dimensional space, with signature speciﬁed below. The space has
thirteen dimensions as there is split between 11 dimensions and a torus ﬁber. These
points are used as unramiﬁed points placed on the n-sphere after compactifying the
plane, so there are now 13 unramiﬁed points. The points are chosen in a symmetric
fashion so that they are equidistant from eachother, and also in a manner so that
a polynomial of degree 5 speciﬁes the unramiﬁed surface. The rotation of the con-
ﬁguration on the n-sphere allows one term in polynomial, the ﬁfth, to be dropped
through a Poincare reduction (ﬁx one point and rotate).

The degree 4 polynomial

P (x) = α1x4 + α2x3 + α3x2 + α4x + α5 ,

(12)

−

speciﬁes the unramiﬁed surface described by an n-sphere with a symmetric order-
ing of 13 points. This polynomial also describes a torus, but with the parameters
α1 =
1/α5 satisfying the antipodal constraint. This follows from specifying n = 5
together with the resolution of a degree 5 quintic in an ambient 13-dimensional space
of arbitrary signature with the property that the toric is quintic together with its hy-
perkahler structure, which is Pennington’s theorem. Thus the polynomial describes
a torus after a Poincare resolution. One coordinate is free but used to resolve the
torus into a ﬁve-sphere. Due to the Poincare map, there is one ramiﬁed point on the
surface, with all of the previous 13 unramiﬁed points taken oﬀ the surface into the
ambient 13 dimensional spacetime. The torus will be utilized to describe the torus
of the SL(2, Z) = SL(2, R)/Z and the remaining 13 points are used to resolve the

7

moduli space except four which are not necessary. These four points are used to close
the R4 into a ball in a ﬁber-wise action, which is still a 4-sphere.

It is necessary that the parameters labeling the 13 points satisfy a unimodularity
constraint so that the Poincare reduction goes through. This is a determinant con-
straint on 13 scalar parameters describing the equidistant distance from one point
to its neighbor using the round metric for example on the unit 5-sphere. These 13
parameters specify the conﬁguration of the 13 points. The unimodularity constraint
is that

det(αiαj)

= n/p ,

(13)

which is an integer mod its largest prime number being an integer also. This is
automatic if the following theorem due to is used: Consider a round ball with unit
radius and determinant unity of its collection of n points. If n mod its reduction to p
points is unity then the condition of unimodularity holds. In our case n= 13 and p= 5
generate unimodularity as they are coprime. Our condition holds, and the Poincare
resolution is smooth.

The torus with one ramiﬁed point can accept a point, placing two punctures on
it. The remaining 11 points are left oﬀ the torus. One of the unramiﬁed points on the
torus is then bifurcated into a branch cut between two bifurcations, such as the loca-
tion of two spin ﬁelds. Note that bifurcating the other point would make the torus a
(hyperelliptic) genus two surface, although this is not done here; in this interpretation
the independent α and β cycles are correlated with one or two supersymmetries in
the target space. The S1 is then given a non-trivial ﬁber over the punctured and
branch tori. This is trivial except for a gauge connection which gives monodromy
around punctures of holomorphy 1, i.e. unramiﬁed poles or branch cuts. The ﬁber
is speciﬁed by a pair of integers, or a complex number nR + inR. Alternatively the
ﬁber can be seen as an S1 over the hyperelliptic surface with the two independent
homology cycles specifying the monopole gauge connections.

Two of the 11 points are resolved into two gauge independent circles of radius
one. Radius one is invariant under T-duality, and there is no ambiguity. There is
still an unramiﬁed point that is hidden because the circle closed on itself; imagine
(ǫ) distance from the other end of the string and before closing add
the point an
additional points. Place an additional three unramiﬁed points on each of the circles
and branch them out after rotating one of the points so as to complete a torus with
an unramiﬁed surface and a trivial ﬁber. The three unramiﬁed branch cuts can be
extended to a genus three surface, which is elliptic by deﬁnition.

minant constraint on 13 scalar parameters describing the equidistant distance from

The previous describes the M-theory moduli space conﬁguration, which accom-
panies the ten-dimensional component of spacetime. In the following the compactiﬁ-
cation of these dimensions is described.

There are ﬁve points remaining, and these are used to deﬁne the target spacetime
theory. One is used to create an n-sphere by considering the n-sphere as an n+1-sphere
and setting one coordinate to zero, or simply dropping it in a Poincare manner, in a
recursive manner, so that the m-sphere is obtained. This is done for an S1, an S2,
and an S3 using three points. The fourth space is not as trivial through the sphere
reduction.

The four-sphere is obtained by compactifying the four-dimensional ﬂat geometry
and adding one of the unramiﬁed points. A background background F5 ﬂux is added
to the sphere to modify it to an anti-de Sitter signature. The point is added to

coherence requires, for they are at rest in a stable minimum.

make the metric conformally ﬂat instead of spatially ﬂat; the latter is common in the
literature. A point added changes the metric to conformally ﬂat instead of spatially
ﬂat due to a hyperbolic resolvable singularity. This changes the curvature to round
instead of ﬂat for a given conformal class, and this results in the addition of ﬁve ﬂux
units thus changing the signature to round. The anti-de Sitter class is then changed
to de Sitter, for the given amount of ﬁve-form ﬂux. This breaks supersymmetry, but
the scenario preserves modular invariance as the anomaly in the beta functions is still
cancelled.

VI. General String S-matrix and Eﬀective Action

The S-matrix of the general string is determined from three elements:

1) elements in the transﬁnite representation Lα=1

a,b , with a possible Wick rotation

2) coeﬃcients αn multiplying the transﬁnite elements

3) modular functions containing the coupling dependence

The coeﬃcients and modular functions in 2) and 3) multiply the operators that
deﬁne the S-matrix. Only the analytic in derivative terms are considered, and their

12

form is

S =

Z √g

αnFn(τ, ¯τ )

On .

X

(16)

The non-analytic terms are also determined through both unitarity and special repre-
sentations of the transﬁnite algebra. In fact, the computation of the string scattering
to all genera and instanton number deﬁnes these special representations.

The representations to the string theories are listed in the table,

The representations and their particle content are further investigated in [42]. All
of the representations are aﬃne extensions Lα=1
a,b . The ghost sector, which contains
one tachyon, is marked with a prime index. The left, right representations of La,b
are a gauge multipet and a set of supersymmetric partners. The elements in the
representations must be supersymmetrized to ﬁll out the entire string spectrum; after
supersymmetrization the full set of operators is obtained, and completely describes the
terms in the S-matrix. The last step requires summing over the tower of inequivalent,
like Verma modules, ﬁeld contents related to the primary ones listed above; the
inequivalent ones span the numbers a which diﬀer from those above by multiples of
3. b is a ﬁxed parameter, which depends on the background and its ﬂuctuactions or
spatial-temporal dependence.

VIII. IIA Superstring Theory

The IIA theory is obtained from IIB by T-duality. Shrink the unit S1 to zero ra-
dius, causing a conical point. T-dualize by using an S-duality transformation followed
by a switch of the following transﬁnite representations in (18),

L1,2 L′

1,3 L1,4 ↔

L3,1 L′

3,2 L3,4 ,

(31)

in that order; the multiplets are the gravity, gauge, and matter multiplets. The point
is blown back up to the unit S1. If the circle is not blown down to a point then it is
involuted to a circle with radius α′/R, i.e. the T-dual.

Then the previous modular functions

IIB
are replaced to match the appropriate
s
E
holomorphicity; the functions in IIA are the same as in IIB. The fact that these basis
functions are identical can be seen from their deﬁnition, the diﬀerential equations
(22)-(23).

E8 and SO(32) Heterotic Theories

16

(32)

(33)

The quantum heterotic theory is obtained through the following steps. Blow
down the S1 and T 2, i.e. the S3 Hopf ﬁbration, to a double pole. The ﬁber structure
holds together the conﬁguration even when not a double pole from inﬁnite expansion
due to the presence of matter on the S3. The origin of the matter is due primarily
from real states in the ten dimensions made from the ﬁber bundle of n-spheres; the
matter has a small but zero probability of quantum tunneling onto the S3, and most
likely the largest sphere with the most matter makes the largest contribution, but
this depends on the relative position of the 3-sphere with the n-spheres and also with
the two genus three hypersurfaces. (General comments about resolving singularities
in the heterotic theory are found in [48, 58, 50, 59].)

The holomorphic (left) half of the IIB ten dimensions should be replaced with
the holomorphic half of the bosonic string, with a 16-dimensional Narain lattice in
E8 conﬁguration. The S3 still has a two unramiﬁed simple poles. Open the
the E8 ×
four n-spheres, from n = 1, . . . , 4, by moving the four unramiﬁed points on the four
n-spheres to the S3, one at a time, using the unramiﬁed pole located at the origin
of the S2. There are ﬁve unramiﬁed poles on the S2 and one on the ﬁber S1. To
complete the process, use the previous procedure to move the ramiﬁed pole at the
origin of the now punctured S4 to the S2, making a total of seven poles in total in
the S3 ﬁber bundle.

Take the elliptic hypersurfaces, and by pinching the holes, change one into an S2
with three unramiﬁed points (which were created into three branch cuts pinned by
two poles of order a half). Then the S3 can be extended with another ﬁber S2
S2
over S2. The bundle is an S7, which will admit an Poincare reduction to an S3 by
setting the S2 coordinates to zero. There are now 12 unramiﬁed zeros which may be
removed if the ﬁber is piecewise connected between one S2 and the ﬁrst S2; it is, due
to a homotopy condition of Ricci-ﬂatness which is imposed and simple to implement.
Consider traversing a closed path from the ﬁrst 2-sphere to the second 2-sphere; this
path is homotopy equivalent to a straight line, and as such, the same thing can be
done in the inverse. Twisting these has no eﬀect, but lifting them to the rest of the
bundle could have an eﬀect. The homotopy of any ﬁber bundle S3 is zero, so that
there is no obstruction to the assertion of trivial ﬁrst homotopy.

×

Next, three points are removed and used to make an elliptic genus three hyper-
surface, as done in the moduli space construction. Note that there are 9 unramiﬁed
points left in the 7-sphere bundle and one ﬁxed point. Alternatively, the 12 poles are
kept and to ensure that the Z7/7 survives in the circle ﬁber over the 2-sphere when
lifted over the S2
S2 the Donaldson-Yau invariant of the ﬁber bundle must remain
as is (e.g. s=400,t=40).

⊗

17

In sum there are two moduli space conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst is comprised of the
S3 and two elliptic genus three hypersurfaces. The second is from the elliptic surface
and the S7. Each elliptic surface is described by a curve,

P (x) =

aixi .

i=8

X

(34)

An involution to an 8-sphere is manifest; the round one has a Z8/8 symmetry which
becomes Z7/7 when one of the coordinates is set to vanish. Generally there are only
28 complex structures on the round 8-sphere [43], and the previous sphere speciﬁes
only 5 of them. Choose one that is compatible with duality as follows. Take the
round 2-sphere and model it with a NUT and 2 parameters. This is because the
elliptic surface really has an unramiﬁed point that has not become ramiﬁed yet; the
initial curve is not exactly closed when those unramiﬁed points where placing onto
the Riemann surface. However, before closing the torus, which is accomplished by
pushing one of the poles onto the end of the string, a single Dehn twist is performed.
This causes the blown up sphere, after unpinching the hole of the torus and placing
the unramiﬁed point on the sphere, to have a NUT with charge one.

Having pinched the torus into the sphere, borrow an unramiﬁed point and put
in the center and blow down to remake a torus; Only this torus has a NUT. Push
the NUT into the origin where there are two poles on top of each other. The NUT
is resolved into a 2-sphere with antipodal points identiﬁed, which are pushed away
from the origin so that the solid angle subtended is less than 4π2. The ﬁber product
S2
S2 is used to parameterize the complex structures of the round 7-sphere. There
are four parameters and a radius in the ﬁber product.

⊗

The round 7-sphere is used as a guide in constructing the exact diﬀerential that
deﬁnes the modular functions used in the S-matrix. The complex structure must
E8 complex moduli that enters into its ﬁber
be speciﬁed, and it relates to the E8 ×
structure over the S3 base. However, the complex moduli are not required for the
scattering directly, but are required in order to specify which branch and the pole
location of the diﬀerential operator that is used to determine the level s functions,
such as the
Es ones in IIB superstring theory. Choose a direction in the bundle
S2
S2 along with a radius and call it v; its norm is one due to it being deﬁned
on a direct product rather than on a bundle. Choose another direction in the ﬁber
product and denote it by w; its norm is not one and is seemigly equivalent to v despite
an additional parameter in w, but the latter is projectively equivalent. This is clear
from the topological index being the same, i.e. by Riemann-Roch evaluated at the

⊗

18

origin of the root lattice, the complex structure has a singularity everywhere but there
due to the vanishing of the radius. The vanishing signals that the complex moduli
jump, but they dont. The Riemann-Roch identity states that the moduli space will
jump one unit if there is a singularity or branch cut in the complex moduli plane,
but only if it cannot be removed to another location [44]. The space has a branch
from zero on out to inﬁnity due to monodromy of a half, which is apparent in the
S2
S2 if the unramiﬁed point is split and mapped to a curve in the complex structure
moduli plane. Because the point is complex and also unramiﬁed, the loophole in the
Riemann-Roch identity is guaranteed to work. The topological index is the same as
the ﬁxed radius to a unit S2
S2, and the number of free moduli is four, including
the ﬁxed radii which are not allowed to vary.

⊗

×

The number of parameters in the diﬀerential equation require the speciﬁcation of
the SL(2, Z) coupling τ and ¯τ , the holomorphic prepontential of the ﬁber and requires
its complex moduli to specify without ambiguity, and the lattice of the heterotic
model. Consider the following: Take a sphere and rotate it by one unit. Mark
the point and rotate back; then rotate again by another unit. Rotate back and
continue until the set of points ﬁlls out a lattice of points such as the one which
E8 is described by, but in curvilinear planar coordinates. Two patches are
E8 ×
required to describe the set of data; however, only one patch is required to describe
the set of points as the ramiﬁed point at inﬁnity does not have any data in its (small)
neighborhood. The patch with the lattice data can be mapped onto the 2-sphere ﬁber
in S2
S2, with the exception of a point that does not possess any data locally in its
×
neighborhood.

The lattice data describes the complex structure with a non-trivial mapping of
a unit disc onto the 2-sphere. Delete the origin point of the disc and map it onto
the unit 2-sphere; the anti-podal map deﬁnes complex conjugation on a section of a
L2 line bundle on a twistor ﬁbration. The twistor ﬁbration is required to specify a
line bundle with the lattice data that can be used to construct a holomorphic ﬁeld
with the complex data that is inserted into the diﬀerential map, in order to deﬁne
the modular functions. Consider the example of a 2-sphere with a line mapped to a
region; it maps out a line as it moves around, and hence ﬁlls a region. However it is
spinning and some of the time it is multiply covering previously covered areas in its
region; this is a problem if the area it sweeps has to be calculated. Consider the case
of uniform rotation and take a pullback to the disk of its rotation and covered data;
data is black and its covered region is blue, and the lattice points are green with a
white background. Take the covered region and map it to a second disk, together with
the lattice data; the twistor information is contained in the set of lattice points that

19

are mapped onto the secondary disc. The secondary disc with the lattice locations
are then used in a twistor manner to ﬁnd the time evolution of the spinning/nutating
line segment.

×

S2 using only one dimension of the base 2-sphere. The ﬁber S2

In the heterotic case, the unit disc not only contains the lattice data but also
potential toric information about the blow-up of a Calabi-Yau that the lattice could
be a ﬁber over, in the ten-dimensional portion of the base space. This is useful, as the
complex line is now a curve of cohomogeniety two in the base, but is a line in the ﬁber
of S2
S2 over the
base then describes the time evolution of the base manifold, including its complex
structure which is what we want to ﬁnd. The latter can be found as a projection
of this multiply wound 2-sphere ﬁber on the base to the real line via a map called
the Hurwitz construction, which this is partly based on. The Hurwitz construction
is too simple when compared with the above; however, it has the same feature in
determination of a cohomogenous curve from the ﬁber bundle as the Hurwitz map.
The Hurwitz map is based on a twistor bundle and a line, and the one adopted here
S3
is based on an S3 ﬁber, a curve of cohomogeneity one with respect to the Mbase ×
multiplying the line element and cohomogeniety with respect to the latter sphere cross
line, together with a twistor space describing the time evolution of the cohomegenous
one curve.

×

The twistor space allows us to create a function, given the appropriate twistor and
lattice data, that reconstructs the ﬁber if the base manifold and its complex structure
is known. Consider a ﬂat ten-dimensionsal space, with trivial complex structure. The
curve is not a three-manifold but rather a one-dimensional line element by Hodge
duality. The Hodge property follows from extending the S1 in the sphere product,
picking up the curve in the complex plane where the data on the 2-sphere has been
stored, Hodge-dualizing to a point and then resolving with the aid of the Hurwitz-
like moment map; the S1 then shrinks back to its former self. Else the S2 can be
extended as in the S1 case, and this allows for a four-dimensional Hodge action to be
performed on the 3-volume. The S2 can now be shrunk to its former self, with one
exception; this is that its conformal class has changed by one unit requiring another
unit of ﬁve-form ﬂux to be added. Also, the conformal class might induce scattering
of ﬁve-form and gravity with the E8 vectors in a non-trivial fashion because it requires
instanton-like modes in the gravity sector. The instantons are in the ground ring of
the (0, 0) model and their excitations are exponentially suppressed small E8 instantons
at strong coupling [51]-[56].

The Hurwitz-like map can be solved for using the linearization of the metric data
of the map from the S2 to the complex line. This map, when applied to a sample

20

propagating string, has only two excitations, longitudinal and transverse, and it obeys
a ﬁeld Monge-Ampere equation in the manner

∂τ ∂¯τ σ + φσ + φ∗σ = 0 .

(35)

The diﬀerential equation that the modular functions obey may be found directly
by reading it oﬀ of the ﬁber bundle structure. The S1 which is ﬁbered over the S2 is
also ﬁbered over each of the elliptic genus three hypersurfaces.

The S2 is also ﬁbered over each of the two hypersurfaces, and the ﬁber does
not entangle with the S1 ﬁber. This requires the following three conditions. The
Chern class of the S2 ﬁber is trivial, causing the SL(2, Z) invariance to be trivially
dependent on the auxiliary Riemann surface. The ﬁber should be called auxiliary as
its sole function is to branch the SL(2, Z) over the elliptic hypersurfaces; this causes
the non-trivial ﬁber of the E8 lattice over the elliptic genus three hypersurfaces to
have non-trivial monodromy around the SL(2, Z) and is not trivial. Last, the S2 over
the elliptic genus three hypersurfaces can be shrunk to a line, as the ﬁber is trivial,
and also stable because only two unramiﬁed points are used in its overall construction,
with one staying at the base of the ﬁber, and 4 are allowed in case points wander on it.
The latter is important in the phenomenology as diﬀerent scenarios require various
placement of points and depending on the placements the elements in the ﬁbered
moduli space might be unstable to decay, with a ’pushing’ and ’pulling’ unramiﬁed
points or the elements might explode.

g=3 , E(1)

Each elliptic hypersurface has an E8 ﬁber on it. The same E8 is also ﬁbered over
both the S1, and for compact support to ensure the ﬁbers dont ’break’, it is ﬁbered
over S2. The conﬁguration is also relevant to mass generation of the fermions and
is discussed in the section on phenomenology. The total ﬁber bundle, including the
elements S1, S2, M d=2
are collected in a network of ﬁber structures;
also, of the six in the list, the second through sixth items can be made holomorphic
or anti-holomorphic with three 3 items in each class. The holomorphy is useful in
that if the number of handles or genus is required to change, then it can be doubled
from the lowest amount by doubling the curve into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
curves. The doubling can be used in mass generation and its use is explained in the
phenomenology section.

The various ﬁbers produce the ﬁve contributions to a diﬀerential equation whose
solution represents the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the het-
erotic superstring. The S2 ﬁber of the SL(2, Z) has the contribution,

21

∆SL(2,R)/Z fs = λsfs ,

(36)

with λs = s because there is no zero of the ﬁber; it routes also through the genus three
hypersurface and back to the S2. If the Chern class of the two ﬁbers are the same
then the zeros of the ﬁber can be chosen to coincide [48],[40],[41] (these references
ared throughout in the following). The chern class of the ﬁrst one is 4 and that of the
second one is 8; a unit of ﬂux on the ﬁrst ﬁber raises it to 5 and lowers the second
one to 7 because the unramiﬁed point moved. Add one more ﬂux unit and the pair
of ﬁbers have ﬂux 6 and 6; the ﬂux arrangement is a bit unstable because the points
want to move around. Ramiﬁcation of all the points is not advised because particle
dynamics in the ten dimensional space require some freedom in their placement and
movement. The points can be ramiﬁed but not generally; in this case nail down the
two unramiﬁed points on the S1 and S2 with the ramiﬁcation process [48] which is not
simple as the S1 ﬁber is not trivial. The ramiﬁcation points can be brought into the
S2 via via a hole that is made when an unramiﬁed point is pinched oﬀ the closed genus
0 surface. This point has to traverse the S1 ﬁber to be able to ramify the unramiﬁed
point there. This is possible if the ﬁber has a certain amount of ﬂux to make it stable
to ramiﬁcation; this is possible only if the ﬂux is conﬁgured even temporarily or in the
early universe so that the ramiﬁcation proceeds in a stable manner. The ramiﬁcation
point is then returned to the genus three hypersurface and is increased to genus three.
The other two points are ramiﬁed and unramiﬁed with the hole now closed, e.g. the
job of the former.1 The ﬂux conﬁguration of 1 unit and 3 units on the S1 and the S2
ﬁbers; in the holomorphic factorization of the ﬁber, useful in phenomenology, 1 unit
of 2 units on the P3 and the P2 should be consistent with duality if the ramiﬁcations
are chosen to absorb the additional P ﬁber. This is possible if the ramiﬁcations are
chosen to coincide with the ﬁbers’ poles. Then the P3 and P2 collapse back to the
former S3 and S2 with the former being a Hopf ﬁbration on the S2.

−

Much of the previous analysis is addressing the point of whether the eigenvalue
is s or s(s
1/2). The latter is more natural, which compares with previous modular
forms and in previous studies of duality of the Heterotic superstring. There are two
points on the S2, one of which unramiﬁed and now is ramiﬁed due to the second point.
The two ramiﬁed poles on the ﬁber, which open singularities in the base, coincide
with the two ramiﬁed points there and this is reﬂected in λs being a polynomial
degree two; the singularity is brought to Jordan normal form and resubstituted into

stress current and supercurrent, and is in section 2.

22

conjugacy class 3 when it becomes a normal function. This causes the singularity
to develop an ankle, or a branch, which stabilizes it further; furthermore the ﬁber
develops an inﬁnite class singularity when there is a cusp form [48]. The ﬁber is now
s and vice versa; on the keyhole region of SL(2, Z), the
related by duality, s to 1
duality acts this way, and the eigenvalue λs is s(1
s) up to a constant which can be

normalized to one by tree-level perturbation theory.

The S1 ﬁber contributes the term to right hand side of (36),

The delta function is to cancel the divergence at s = 1. This contribution is there
to make the singularity at the top of the S1 bundle go away, and is caused by an
unramiﬁed point that has become ramiﬁed by a little more surgery as before. Then the
same function as used in the IIB superstring case, which is explained now, contributes;
there is a singularity at the ramiﬁed point at the top of the S1 ﬁber which is nulliﬁed
by the product of Eisenstein functions which is symmetrized due to the permutation
of the modular ring involved. Also the singularity at s = 1 is removed by adding the
appropriate cancellation term, which is an anomalous function in SL(2, R)/Z2,

(38)

The S1 also a combination due to the chirality of the theory, that may be repre-
sented by a chiral boson somewhere in the ﬁber. It has one ﬁxed point, ﬁxed under
the action of chirality, and so may be represented on the section (i.e.
the modu-
lar function) by a function contiguous, homologous to its branched covering, to the
unramiﬁed point at the base of the S3. The function is taken to be

s +

2

(39)

where s represents its branched cover, which is a pole of order 3/2 (this is discussed
in the section in phenomenology) and is chiral because the branch of order 3/2 has an
orientation. The function φ is a holomorphic function that contributes to the metric
function as

23

gz ¯z = ∂zφ1 + ∂¯z2φ2

(40)

and has a holomorphic diﬀerential. Here ∂zφ1 is φ
1, and its abelian diﬀerential
of the ﬁrst kind pulls out the left term on the right hand side of the above equation

because the contour is anti-clockwise and passes over the singularity in P1. This is
a branch around the pole in φ2, the form of which is justiﬁed by the presence of a
zero in the region bounded by the contour P1; this means the contribution of the pole
cancels because the integrand is now anti-holomorphic and the contributon of the
branch and the zero integrate to zero mod 1 (the loop is the butterﬂy conﬁguration
surrounding the zero once and the branch twice to give it monodromy 0 mod 2). The
net contribution is that in (39). The function σ is genus three function on the genus
two surface, the torus of duality, which has to be present due to the following reasons:
it is holomorphic, it has two branches due to a double ﬁber on the S2, it is holomorphic
in s because each piece of the dissected ﬁber is holomorphic, it has an anomaly at
one point because the chiral boson can pick up a phase angle around the S1 (the ﬁve
form ﬂux does not couple and there is a deﬁcit of charge due to a ﬁxed point at the
top of the S1 ﬁber), there is a holomorphic 2-form on the 2 sphere coming from the
projection of the chiral boson onto the 2-sphere and can be used to cancel the anomaly
from the ramiﬁed point of degree 3/2 with a branch extending to another point on
the S1. This occurs because the two unramiﬁed (one previously ramiﬁed) are in their
most ramiﬁed form according to. There a Calabi-Yau is presented that, in accordance
with S and T duality, encompasses the S1 and is tangential to the ten-dimensional
spacetime. This construction reﬂects this Calabi-Yau though the presence of 3 not
2 elliptic genus three hypersurfaces; the branch of degree 3 is resolved with three
NUTS because of the order 3 = 3/2 + 3/2 into a generic but speciﬁed genus three
elliptic hypersurface which can be put together with the other two into a ramiﬁed but
with circle ﬁber (the eleventh dimension) Calabi-Yau. It is stable because it has a
non-trivial ﬁber with the S2 and the heterotic gauge space without any singularities
and is Ricci-ﬂat. The last reason is that the removable singularity on the S1 that
is unramiﬁed can be brought to the surface of the Calabi-Yau and the ﬁve-form ﬂux
cancels its presence.

24

(42)

(43)

This results in a contribution of the form (36) with the function σ of the form
of a Weierstrauss P-function on a genus three hypersurface that is not hyperelliptic.
This function has the form when evaluated at one, thus changing the gauge ﬁber to a
ramiﬁed one with a branch at the origin and a pole at zero, encompassing the entire
Calabi-Yau with a curve of cohomegeniety three,

The argument of the Wieirstrauss function is the evaluation at all points of the divisor
of the reduced hypersurface to a hyperelliptic curve of degree 5. The moduli are the
coupling τ and its anti-holomorphic counterpart ¯τ when treated as a holomorphic
counterpart due to the only moduli present. The Calabi-Yau moduli are ﬁxed by
requiring that the gauge bundle is even and stable over all points. A ﬁxed moduli
can not be used in the Wieirstrauss function as there must be singularities present
reﬂecting the presence of the points on the which there ia a ﬁber in the base of the
S2; there are two points sitting on top of eachother and the moduli chosen are τ and
¯τ .

The ﬁnal contribution arises from the gauge degrees of freedom ﬁbered over the
two genus three elliptic surfaces, which have merged into a non-trivial Calabi-Yau.
There are three branched points from the holes of the two surfaces, for a total of
six; three of which close with the other three with branches of order 1/2 (degree
2). The contribution is of the same form as the SL(2, Z) invariant function with
the τ parameter holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic ¯τ treated as a holomorphic
extension because both are needed to specify the anomaly which was cancelled (e.g.
the cancellation and contribution of the Eisenstein contributions from the two genus
three hypersurfaces and the S1). There are no singularities on the ﬁber but there
are three branches when represented on the complex plane. This suggests that the
function contributing has the form,

The E8 functions are deﬁned by the root lattice, and the permutation is performed
as before the ﬁber can be holomorphically split into sub-units of weight number
(wj, wj) = (n/2, n/2) which are then permuted. The zero mode, or rather the anoma-
lous contribution is then subtracted as before.

×

The function h(τ2) represents the contribution of a single degree of freedom which
for sake of clarity we call a ghost mode. It exists simply because we require a poly-
nomial to ramify over; the ramiﬁed point’s position and type is generated by the
polynomial. In this case there are three branch points requiring six degrees of free-
dom per point on the Calabi-Yau for a total of 36. Two more specify the orientation
of the three branches, as the third is oriented diametrically opposite to one of them

of ﬁve-form ﬂux to be placed on the 6 points evenly distributed over the points and
branches. One more is place on the Calabi-Yau without structure of the points and
branches so that the U(1) degree of freedom is cancelled there; this occurs when su-
persymmetry is broken. Without supersymmetry breaking the ghost mode cancels
and there is an anomaly, so that a tachyon appears and is consistent with the the-
ory. As a result, another transﬁnite representation is included to cancel the modes’
oscillation and the contribution from h. The tachyon may or may not exist due to
incomplete or complete cancellation of the function h. The coeﬃcients of the function
h are taken to unity by moving the points and branches inside the Calabi-Yau before
ramiﬁcation. Notice that the contribution of the tachyon exists outside of perturba-
tion theory as there are contributions with positive powers of τ2, and it is S-duality
invariant. To complete the form of the heterotic gauge bundle, take w = s.

There are several scenarios that change the ﬂux organization; this is useful for
compactiﬁcations. First, instead of ﬂux put on the S3, put it on the S2 and arrange
for the S1 to be wrap a non-trivial 1-cycle rather be embedded in it through the
ramiﬁed points. Second, instead of ﬂux put on the S1 ﬁber put it on the Calabi-Yau
3 fold around a non-trivial π1 generator which could be ramiﬁed by one of the three
oriented branch points; they are oriented because the resolution of a triple singularity
requires that they have oriented directions. Third, the de Rham complex could be
used to make the p-forms accept the ﬂux; this is straightforward as the Calabi-Yau
is made up of three ﬁxed moduli Riemann surfaces with two non-trivial ﬁbers. Four

26

ﬁbers are redundant except for a branch cut due to having two ﬁbers on the same
surface which is resolved by adding more ﬂux; more ﬂux might destabilize the resolved
the singular R4 and make it unstable for cosmology which is the case and is discussed
indirectly in the later section on phenomenology. The amount of ﬂux is two units
and only 4 more can be placed on the singular R4; this would cause the singularity to
collapse to a point and the big bang would occur far sooner than what we expect(ed).
E8 16-dimensional holomorphic root space, but
Some ﬂux can be placed on the E8 ×
the total allowed strength can not exceed the ﬁrst Chern class which means four units
per E8 branch. 8 units would compensate for the problem of the big bang occuring
when it might occur(ed), but the extra degrees of freedom from 1 to 8 points might
make gauge phenomenology diﬃcult. Each ﬂux unit produces a naive factor of a
U(1) which has to be broken by further modiﬁcation of the compactiﬁcation and the
arrangement of ﬂux, and generically 4 ﬂux units on each branch are allowed. This
scenario is not preferred from a gauge anomaly point of view, and also from a stability
point of view as the closer to unstable the conﬁguration is the more modiﬁcation to a
branched but non-singular R4 becomes, and also the more the vacuum would produce
particles such as gauge modes, ghosts, and/or tachyons.

w

The ﬁnal issue is the modiﬁcation of the index on the modular functions EE8×E8
.
As observed in there is an obstruction to using w = n/2 as an index and the one
w = n/4 or w = n/5 seems to be liked. There is an issue with embedding the
Calabi-Yau in the manner done in which was not branched well. The paper has
several branches emanating from the Calabi-Yau and based on ﬁve branched and
unramiﬁed points at the top of the ﬁber. If they are ramiﬁed then the ﬁber would
be too singular to accept compact support, or have functions exist as a result; only
2 or 3 ramiﬁcations are allowed as the Chern class is 7 for this ﬁber with an S2
emanating from each branch or sub-ﬁber. A branched ﬁber requires three units, one
each for the point, the branch (or a half) and the base point, and as a result only
two or three of these branches can be held down by the ramiﬁcations. If they are not
ramiﬁed, the ﬁber will presumably be unstable with the branches reverting back to
their unbranched form. The Chern class contributes to the energy, and the minimal
energy conﬁguration is the previous.

There is a way to avoid the singularity. Branch the ﬁve points on a cylinder with
two ﬁber points deleted or a cone with one ﬁber point deleted. The ﬁve points have
base the cone and extend to the set of branch points on the Calabi-Yau. Two or
one of the points have been resolved into spheres with the use of the ﬁber points,
and they are ramiﬁed. Two more points are found diameterically opposite to the
ramiﬁed points as the branch points have been allowed to pass through the holes and

27

ramiﬁed opposite to the holes; they’re not ramiﬁed until a base point together with
its branch accepts one unit of ﬂux, further ﬂux of one unit is added each to the points
opposite to the holes. The holes can now accept two more points, which make them
immediately ramiﬁed as they are holes and no ﬂux is necessary to make them stick.
One more ramiﬁed point requires 3/2 or 2 units of ﬂux to make it ramiﬁed anywhere
on the cylinder or cone; the ramiﬁcation of a point on a cylinder or a cone requires 1
less than than usual due to a gauge ﬁeld present, which is turned on by the ﬁve-form
wrapped around a non-trivial homology generator; the ﬂux necessary is 3/2 for the
ramiﬁed point in the Calabi-Yau and 1/2 unit for the base point at the top of the
ﬁber, which is total not 5/2 or 3. The total ﬂux is then 6 or 7, depending on whether
a branched point requires 1/2 or 1 unit of ﬂux to ramify2 Seven units of ﬂux are not
allowed on the ﬁber due to the Chern class of 3, which allows 2n + 1 for stability.
Then this conﬁguration is not allowed; however, if the other point of view of 1/2 per
branch point is used, then the conﬁguration is 6 and hence is meta-stable. The ﬁber
is so close to unstable that it will probably cause particles to be emitted from the
vacuum, such as gluons, E8 fermions, and maybe tachyons. This would cause further
damage to the ﬁber and it might decay.

X. Type I and Type I’ Theories

In the type I theory the two unramiﬁed points on the S3 are collected and placed
at the origin of the S2, thus producing a singularity of order two. The point at the
origin of the S4 in the compactiﬁcation is pulled oﬀ and placed on the torus; the
presence of the pole of order (1, 1) signals a bolt S2/Z2 at the origin of S2. Blowng
up the singularity generates an additional S2.

2, 1

The (1, 1) pole can be split into a pair of branch cuts with endpoints of the type,
in pairs, ( 1
2). There are two orientations, (1, 0) and (0, 1), which require labeling
the branch cuts with an orientation. The unramiﬁed double pole can be resolved into
these branch cuts if the orientation is preserved. The branch cuts generate the double
cover of the 2-sphere.

The ﬁber of the S1 is speciﬁed by its behavior in the proximity of the two branch
cuts on S2, or rather, on CP 1. There are four contours generated the homology, of
which three are independent. Call the line integrals of a 1-form around one of the
branch cuts on the two sheets α±; the two sheets are labeled by + and
. The line
integral between two points of order (0, 1/2) and (0, 1/2) on diﬀerent branch cuts is
called β±. Only three of the contour integrals are independent and β− is eliminated.

are in correspondence with the two functions fsfs±1/2 with s an integer multiple of a
half. The gauge bundle is speciﬁed by integrals of the connection around the contours,
and result in two integers m, n given the α+ and β+ contours. As long as these integers
are non-vanishing the branch cuts can be moved around on the 2-sphere.

XI. SO(32)(n) Heterotic Theories

(52)

(53)

The SO(32) superstring theory follows closely with one exception, the gauge bun-
E8 can be replaced with one of the four gauge groups: Spin(32), Spin(32)/Z4,
dle E8 ×
Spin(32)/Z8 or Spin(32)/Z8. The latter four can be exchanged for a lattice model once
the points are identiﬁed on the ﬁber with a branch cut singularity extending from
one point to another. The Spin(32)/Z8 has two forms as the Cartan sub-algebra can
be modded in several ways and two of them are inequivalent. They have rank 2, 4,
8, 16, and 32.

The inequivalent representation of the weight lattice is arranged to have the
diametrically opposite Cartain generators in the Spin(32)/Z8 algebra to be on a line
or at an angle of 60 or 600 degrees; the latter is on the 6-fold copy of the realization of
the weight lattice on the complex plane. The twisting of the gauge degrees of freedom
require a speciﬁcation of the ﬁve-form ﬂux which is consistent with the remaining
ﬂux conﬁguration and also modular invariance together with S- and T-duality. This
is accomplished by turning on the ﬁve-form ﬂux such that 2 units are applied to each
resolved point on the gauge ﬁber and 2 units spread over the entire ﬁber. 2 units
are applied to the resolved singularities so that the NUT that they contain can be
converted into a S2 sphere with a punctured hole; there is a branch cut emanating
from the ramiﬁed point diameterically opposite representing the Cartan generator
which passes through the hole to its modded partner Cartan generator. An additional

30

2 units of ﬂux is all over the ﬁber so that it wont be unstable, as by Cheeger’s theorem
an equal amount of ﬂux on ramiﬁed points together with some ﬂux on the entire ﬁber
can be stable only if the diﬀerence, i.e. the Cheeger quantity, is 6 or 12 on a branched
two-dimensional surface; in this case there are 8 Cheeger numbers and 6 or 12 with a
plus or minus sign are required for 16 dimensions. As there are 16 Cartan generators
in the sub-algebra, the Cheeger number must be 6 or 12 mod n, with n the number
of ramiﬁed points. There are 32 ramiﬁed points and all are branched; thus a ﬂux of
2 mod 32 is required. The ﬁrst Chern class prefers 2 in order to be stable.

The embedding of the SO(32) algebra into Spin(32) allows for the possibility of
a heterotic duality between the points and the algebra. There are sixteen resolved
NUTs and one resolved bolt that each contain a S2 of complex structure. One of which
is prefered, which is the bolt. Take the bolt and cover it with a S2 so that the hole is
patched; this is accomplished with one unramiﬁed point used in the construction of
the bolt resolution aftwerwards the bolt becomes ramiﬁed. The bolt can be rotated
and its covered hole oriented to any other point in the ﬁber, using the Fubini-Study
metric on the ﬁber base extended to act on the entire gauge bundle. Then there is an
SO(30) action on the points due to a sequence of orderings together with a shift of the
complex phase as directed for by the bolt; it is non-abelian due to the fact that the
sphere is curved and the orderings of directings do not commute. This group ﬁlls out
an E8 ×
E8 model as the phase angles must ﬁll out a representation of a maximally
E8. The SU(2) is a 3-form which
extended SU(2) which is either Spin(32) or E8 ×
projects as a two-form on the S2 but with the remaining component specifying one of
the angles in the S2; their is no redundancy as the radius has not been set to one. The
actions of the rotations must match with the Cartan sub-algebra, which is non-trivial
due to commutation relations; however, there is a subtlety in the construction as not
all points exist on side of the bolt which could be anywhere. Fix it to be at the end
of the gauge ﬁber. The spinning bolt can label the Cartan generators with a number
and the remaining generators are resolved singularities with ramiﬁed points, which
are all numbered.

The structure constants are deﬁned to reﬂect the inherit curvature of the S2 and
the location of the generators, one of which is H1 the prefered Cartan generator used
to mod the Spin algebra by Zp. The Zp modding reﬂects the generators by adding or
subtracting 2π/p
N to the rotation curve between one point and the other; N = 2
for 8 generators, N = 4 for 16 generators, N = 1 for 4 generators. Each curve
sweeps out a trajectory in the S2 with arclength equal to the phase angle with the
modding ρ
N, and N = 1 is special because it has no elliptic cover,
i.e. a branch of the S2 is not required to uniquely specify the path in case the curve

2π/p

31

runs back on itself. The prefered generator H1 is required not to do this. The H1
requires a commutator with itself, and the line element could go around the sphere
and come back to itself making a mod p cover of the trivial traverse to a point and
then traverse back. This construction is iterable, and the line elements form a group
once the structure constants are deﬁned. The line elements close an inﬁnitesimal
distance apart, proportional to the curvature of the 2-sphere.

The group is either SO(32)/Zp or E8 ×

E8 due to the following; the generators
on the ﬁber are rank 16, and those of the line elements in the S2 are 16 with the
possibility that some duplicate or copy other elements’ actions. The group generators
might roll in back of another group generator if the ﬁber is unstable, which appears
not to be the case because the ﬁrst Chern class is 0 mod N on a manifold of dimension
16; this amount of charge is not normal and the bundle could unwrap [48]. The bundle
may not only unwrap but rather it might dissipate if further electric charge enters,
which means that it is not wanting of further charged particles like the electron, real
or virtual. As the bundle is relatively stable, the gauge group is constructible and
makes sense.

The gauge group must be E8 ×

E8 and this is the Spin/Zp theory. It is rank 16,
is maximally extended from SU(2), and it has a bilinear form of rank 2, inherited
from the 3 form which can integrate on the S2. The latter is degenerate over the
patched hole on the S2 as it doesnt accept any more charge; it should be blown up
into a surface that the 2-form could integrate over. The bundle is then an S4 with
two two-dimensional surfaces forming the direct product space without ﬁber; as such
the product of the two-form can be used as an integration element and this cannot be
a form as the inﬁnitesimal diﬀerentials each appear twice but in an organized fashion.
Each SO(32) generator has a direction, if they dont roll. First, if they roll, then the
Cartan sub-algebra must be relabled. Second, the set of 2-spheres might roll into an
E8 gauge group from the point of the bolt S4, which still has a S2 ﬁber; this is
E8 ×
the basis for the duality. One can form an SL(2, Z) invariant ﬁber shockwave that
causes all the balls to move in particular directions to capture the SO(32)/Zp.

All of the balls are now well-ordered, but one of them, the Cartan generator
has rolled to a new position behind another ball. This process occurs until all the
balls are either behind or in front of their individual sets. The group depends on
the conﬁguration of the sets. In order for the gauge group to be maximally extended
E8 setting, which takes time without the speciﬁc
the balls must line up in an E8 ×
shockwave applied at the base of the S2 bolt; there is a temporary ﬁber from the S2 of
the SL(2, Z) to the bolt and requires one unit of ﬂux to pin down the ramiﬁed point
at the top of the ﬁber. There is only one unit because the S2 at the bottom of the

32

ﬁber requires only one unit and the gauge bundle is suﬃciently rigid that no charge is
necessary; here rigid means that it is close to unstable and naturally unramiﬁed points
are broken and branched without need to ramify. The shockwave is instantaneous.

The conﬁguration rolls into an E8 ×

E8 conﬁguration and T-duality allows one
to unroll the balls for a moment to analyze their conﬁguration. T-duality takes the
complex structure of the bolt and exchanges it with the K¨ahler structure of the bolt,
which is close to zero, and might even vanish. To keep it from vanishing a Taub-NUT
singularity is added that makes the curvature far from zero; of course the singularity
has to be added to cancel but for the moment it is present. To keep the singularity
from almost vanishing, the bolt requires an almost complex extension, such as a
Newijnhuis tensor without compact support. This makes the balls rotate backwards
as time has no direction without support. If they rotate backwards then they will
eventually roll back into their present position, and this can be facilitated by another
quantum well such as that induced by a small and better focused shockwave. Then
they are stuck in the heterotic position by applying ﬁve-form ﬂux that rigidly holds
E8
the conﬁguration. Thus T-duality has been allowed to map SO(32)/Zp to E8 ×
by the ﬂow of the balls from the exceptional heterotic to the orthogonal heterotic
E8
and then back by T-dualizing, and waiting for the balls to roll, to the E8 ×
theory. T-duality will work if the fact that the K¨ahler modulus and the complex
structure modulus are interchanged is recognized; in this case, there are four allowed
conﬁgurations: Spin(32)/Zp with Zp = 1, 2, 4, 8. Because there is one hole and one
singularity on the ball now, the ball sees two objects simultaneously one behind the
other and is required to do so. That limits the group cases to the ones mentioned
with the balls in each row related to each other by the quotient.

Now that the group action is identiﬁed, the balls must rotate into their respective
position to ﬁll out the vector or adjoint representation. In E8 there is no adjoint but
the vector takes its role, so that the adjoint may not be so trivial. The representation
follows from symmetrizing the balls in their current position in each of the sets and
calling the ﬁrst ball their respective Cartan generator; the remaining balls in the set
are descendents.

The ﬁber structure is almost the same between the heterotic orthogonal case
and the exceptional heterotic theory, with one exception. Because there are now ﬁve
theories, the lead candidate must be chosen to supervise the remaining candidate
groups. This means that total supervision of the tower of heterotic orthogonal groups
is under the control of the heterotic orthogonal Z2 group, and that once in this phase
a simple transformation can alter the theory to any of its descendents.

33

The ﬂux conﬁguration is nearly identical in all of these theories with one ex-
ception. Instead of 2 ﬂuxes on the gauge bundle there are 2 mod N with N being
related to the Cheeger sum. That is, the sum of all the ﬂux units on the gauge bundle
must be equal to 2 modulus the sum of all the ﬂux units on the unramiﬁed points to
make them stick so that their combination mod N, the number of ﬂux units on the
points, is equal to zero. See the section above for further details. This is the primary
distinction in the model(s) from the exceptional heterotic case. Another distinction
is the amount of ﬂux on the ﬁbered Calabi-Yau; in this case, as there is fewer ﬂux
on the gauge bundle the ﬂux can be increased in two ways on the 3-fold. One attach
it to points on the manifold with branched covers, which have been glued and re-
solved. Second, attach it to the overall manifold without increasing the sum beyond
the Chern class. Further alternatives are not mentioned. Third, a single point can
still be added to the S2 in the S3 ﬁber bundle; this breaks S-duality as the quotient is
now SL(2, R)/Z 2
2 which is not a group but rather a point-like object. The singularity
can now accept four to eight more units of ﬁve-form ﬂux without destroying the black
hole singularity at the origin of the R4 space. This could be useful for model building.

XII. Compactiﬁcation and Supersymmetry Breaking

The compactiﬁcations considered here go against lore in one aspect; primarily
anti-de Sitter spacetimes are considered, but locally de Sitter ones are presented that
presumably model our neighborhood and local galaxies. Cosmological data cannot
distinguish a redshift with positive or negative cosmological constant if the blueshift
is treated as the microwave background anisotropy. This scenario ﬁts with rings of
compression separated by hundreds of millions of lightyears and as a shockwave of
sorts in the early universe, near the time of big bang nucleosythesis. The latter asser-
tion would explain why there is little signature of the blueshifted matter and would
be found primarily in the CMB dust. Also, our galactic halo could be considered red-
shifted if the compression wave entered our galaxy sooner than expected, for example
in a few hundred million years with an additional compression wave explaining some
of the blue-shift that data has observed in the halo; alternatively a compression wave
may have entered our galaxy later such as in the billions of light-years. It is diﬃcult
to use current data to indicate either scenario, the given above or the one with a
matter dominated universe with uniform expansion rate and constant cosmological.
The expansion rate is consistent with the Hubble’s constant if the compression waves
are placed apart and have the right movement outward from our point of view, and
if Moore’s law is obeyed.

34

XIII. IIB Phenomenology

Remove the point from the S2, after moving to the S1. The point then becomes
ramiﬁed at the origin of the S1 due to the non-trivial ﬁber. This point can be
unramiﬁed by taking in a point at inﬁnity and then sending it back. The unramiﬁed
point on the S1 is used to open the S1, then moved to the a four-dimensonal subspace
of the ten coordinates. Alternatively, a point on one of the elliptic surfaces can be
unramiﬁed by pinching it oﬀ of one of the closed holes and used to unramify the one
on the circle ﬁber. The ﬁber trivializes as the genus drops from genus 3 to genus 2;
if not trivial then the 3-form can be used to make the ﬁber almost trivial, and giving
it a vacuum expectation value. The vacuum expectation is going to modiﬁed anyway
and it is assumed to be not the right value for phenomenology.

The point is taken oﬀ the end of the line segment and placed on a four-dimensional
subspace in the ten dimensions. Because it placed by hand it is ramiﬁed, and can be
blown up as a NUT of degree 1 into an anti-de Sitter space.

The 3-form is taken oﬀ the S1 ﬁber where it was used to trivialize the ﬁber
and moved onto the ten-dimensional space. The resolution of the NUT singularity
requires ﬁve units of ﬂux, which gives the appropriate number to cancel the target
space gravitational beta function and restore modular invariance.

There are various scenarios in the following. Close the remaining ﬁve coordinates
so that a S3, S2, and S1 are made each with a point removed. First construct an
S3 ﬁber over the S2, with the two singularities moved on top of eachother; π3(S2)
is the set of integers and conformal class of one is required for modular invariance
due to the absence of non-integer spins. One point is ramiﬁed due to the non-trivial
ﬁber and one is unramiﬁed, both of which are located at the base of S2. Then treat
the two S1 circles equally which means ﬁber both of them over the S3
S2 bundle;
π1(S3
S2) is the set of integers by Kunneths formula, including the resolution of the
double pole at the origin. The unramiﬁed hole is on top of the ramiﬁed hole and both
are resolved into a crosscap with a double charge located at its antipodal points. π2
of the crosscap is the set of even integers and contributes not to the Kunneth formula
except for a double charge divided by two. The crosscap is then a part of the S3 ﬁber
and can be closed by the addition of another two blown up points.

×

×

There are two S1 ﬁbers over the S3 ×

S2 bundle. The ﬁbers are each speciﬁed
by an integer as the S3 ﬁber is speciﬁed by a complex number, one for the Chern
class and one for the conformal class evaluated on the tangent bundle for the latter.
The ﬂux is chosen to cancel that on the anti-de Sitter space. Two ﬁve forms can be

35

F5 and given the vacuum expectation values. Indeed, if a triple
taken together as F5 ∧
product is taken, and the singularity on one of the genus 3 elliptic hypersurfaces is
blown up appropriately, then the third form can be used to compensate for the ﬂux
in all directions so that they add to zero; this occurs if these two hypersurfaces, the
S1 ﬁber in the eleventh direction, and the ﬁrst ten dimensions are taken as a product,
this gives a manifold interpretation to the presence of the ﬂux and its 15-form. The
ﬂuxes are chosen to agree with phenomenology.

In a diﬀerent scenario, the amount of ﬂux used to alter the bolt at the origin
of R4 can be altered by adding and subtracting no more than two units as the bolt
can withstand only these values before requiring the additional resolution of a new
singularity; the time scale of the instability is presumed shorter than the age of the
universe. The remaining ﬂux is spread among the 6 compactiﬁed dimensions with
ﬂux: one unit on the circle, two on the genus three elliptic hypersurface, and three
S2. This requires four units on the bolt located at the origin of the R4
on the S3
which is now resolved in a de Sitter space.

×

Another scenario is 4 on the elliptic hypersurface, 2 on the circle, and 4 on the
bolt. Another is 4 on the elliptic hypersurface, 2 on the circle, and 4 on the bolt
except one unit is stolen from the S1 ﬁber with a puncture so as to make a total of
5 on the bolt; this is anti-de Sitter but in order to ﬂip the sign of the 5 ten units are
given to the S1 branch singularity which it now becomes due to the large number of
ﬂux units and its instability (its instability is localized to a branch singularity which
is the most general form of a point-like singularity of degree one).

(One more noteworthy solution is the ramiﬁcation of the singularity caused by
the ten units of ﬂux and its placement on the 2-sphere which ﬁlls its hole, else it can
be used to partially compensate for the pinched hole on the elliptic hypersurfaces.
The presence of the point on the hypersurface might cause the entire Riemann surface
to become unstable after blowing up the pinch to genus three. If it becomes unstable
then it might pinch the S2 ﬁber above the ten dimensional space to a point (which
is zero coupling) and then also collapse the remaining genus 3 elliptic hypersurface.
This continues until only the four-dimensional space survives, which will provide the
solution is anti-de Sitter, and causes it become a de Sitter space with 4 or 5 units of
ﬂux. This scenario has a large order pole at the origin of spacetime.)

The presence of holes in the S1 and and a required bolt ﬁlling-in in the S3
ﬁber together with the application of the bolt resolution requires three points to
be brought in from inﬁnity and one returned. Depending on the accuracy of the
phenomenology this scenario could be physical. Two points could also be eﬀectively

removed from the genus three elliptic hypersurfaces. The stability of the conﬁguration
might be drastically altered, and is not prefered, as discussed in the section addressing
this matter and its signature in cosmological data.

XIV. Heterotic Phenomenology

The conﬁguration of the IIB superstring allowed for two supersymmetry break-
ings, either to (0, 0) or (0, 1). The heterotic breaking is identical to the IIB superstring,
with the exception that two points (one ramiﬁed and one unramiﬁed) are required
for a pole of order 6 and only one ramiﬁed point is required for a pole of order 8 [48];
these are located at the origin of the R4. A higher degree singularity with unramiﬁed
points are less singular than expected because the resolution is facilitated by their
movability. The number of allowed ﬂux units varies, from 1 to 4 in the former and
1 to 9 in the latter, leading to a wider class of supersymmetry breakings. M-theory
suggests that the ﬂux conﬁguration would remain close to the same in the Heterotic
phase as in the IIB superstring phase. A computation of the groundstate energy of
the vacuum is required to determine the rate and possibility of a diﬀerent string phase
is one corner of the universe.

×

The mass and the couplings can be found by analyzing the singularity at the
origin of the R4. Examine the resolution of the heterotic pole at the origin. A
NUT of type 1 is blown up into a S2 with two points removed, suggesting a cylinder
S1. The full blow up requires three points to be consistent
between them, i.e. S1
with duality in a holomorphic setting; this results in S1 times S1
S1 with a complex
coordinate spanning the latter, a ﬁber of Chern class 3 as there are two unresolved
blow up points and a ramiﬁed point at the origin of the former S1. The ramiﬁcation
may not be removed as it as located at the origin and the ﬁber is non-trivial; more
points could be brought in from inﬁnity but this is not availaible as in the superstring
case only one point from inﬁnity was required and for consistency this condition is
unaltered.

In [46] the masses of the known particles were found to high accuracy, satisfying

the mass formula [47],

which is accurate to 1ﬁts the pattern with another suppression of (Λ/mpl). For some

37

reason there are 27 combinations of numbers 2i5j between 1 and 1000 with the scales
1, 10, 100, 1000.

The masses can be obtained in accord with the mass formula in (54). Take a
bilinear fermion pair and move it onto a holomorphic S1 ﬁber after passing the initial
S1; it completes a loop via the anti-holomorphic S1 ﬁber. A phase could be added
e−n/16 ¯ψψ; the phase
to the fermion bilinear, as described in [4], that acts as ¯ψψ
could also be interpretated as that of the dihedral group in SO(4, 2) which suggests
that another four points are added to the R4 and resolved. This action was identiﬁed
in [4] as an orbifold of a S4 by Γ4,2, but an orbifold of an S5 with group action from
D(Γ5,1 and they have dimension 8 and 19 [48]. Three
Γ4,3; Γ4,2 is D4 and Γ4,3 is D11 ∧
of the latter are not close to the origin and are not used; the branch point which is
unstable due to nine points on top of eachother sits in between the origins of the two
group actions.

→

The D11 group is good for conformal points when all the points sit on top of
eachother, but resolved. The remainder acts when the points are separated and also
resolved. Each action leaves the bilinear unchanged except one if the centralizer H1
is chosen to be in the corresponding Lie algebra. The phase angle is n/16. There is
no ambiguity as the axis, the Cartan generator H1, is prefered. However, the other
group actions are complicated but the leave the phase unchanged.

Next, the Γ(5, 1) is treated as a conformal extension of the D11 known as Kum-
mer’s algebra and permutes the six dihedral vertices amongst eachother. This action
changes the phase on each vertex as the wavefunction passes due to the action of the
Cartan generator H1 which permutes the phase angles at the vertices. The actions
are chosen in an oriented pathwise fashion from the following steps: 1) choose which
vertex the wavefunction is entering, 2) permute its phase angles by H1, 3) chose an-
other vertex to hop to, 4) permute its phase angle, 5) repeat until the wavefunction
exits though the point it entered after hopping each vertex-vertex only once, which is
unique. The phases allowed from hopping are: en/5, en/6, en/7, en/8, en/9, en/10 except
for one which is resubstituted with m
m + 1 due to angle deﬁcit. The remaining
four generators possess angle deﬁcits from 30 degrees to 90 degrees in increments of
10 degrees, with a

10.

→

±

Due to the uniqueness of the path through every vertex, the phase angles must
add to p/16 with p = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 [7]. The quarks and leptons fall into this category.
When a neutrino enters the chamber point split the ﬁrst point in the ﬁnite lattice to
include a branch and give it a phase angle of n/4 with the other vertices unchanged.
The sum of these terms is n/16
5; the factor of 5 occurs due to the Cartan generator

H1 acting on too many vertices at the same time. In this case H1 has an action on
the entire lattice each time a node is reached.

With the phase angle attached to the fermion bilinear, the pair exits the region
by traversing outward from the resolution of the points. Imagine a black hole, in the
early universe, and the fermion pair traverses through the horizon from the inside
outward (or because there is no casually disconnected region because the fermion
could exit through a path in the higher dimensions). It acquires a mass proportional
to the phase angle, with a scale set by Λ = 1 TeV and mpl so that the ﬁrst term in
(54) is found. This is alluded to partly in [46].

XV. M-theory in higher dimensions

The natural number of dimensions for M-theory is thirteen; the moduli space
presented contain a ﬁbered set of three dimensions with a ten dimensional spacetime.
There are ten in the usual superstring description, and three more in the moduli
space; there is a circle ﬁber over a 2-sphere. The strong coupling limit of IIA is
obtained by an S-duality transformation followed by the limit τ2 → ∞
. The 2-sphere
in the IIA conﬁguration is a 2-torus with complex structure τ , and its volume goes to
inﬁnity. The two torus is the same as a sphere with a puncture at one point and an
unramiﬁed point at the antipodal point; this is due to pinching oﬀ and unramifying
the point in the middle of the torus as the modulus hits the cusp point at (1, √3/2)
thus generating a 2-sphere with a hole at one end and an unramiﬁed point at the
other.

One limit is as follows. Recall that the volume VS of the circle satisﬁes VS = √VT 2,
the volume of the torus. The strong-coupling limit is via gs → ∞
which shrinks the
torus to a point on which the circle is ﬁbered over. The unramiﬁed Rpoint is moved
onto the circle and splits into a line segment. The line segment can be extended to
ﬁll the entire real line, and together with the ten dimensions, is eleven dimensional
spacetime.

A second limit is as follows. The unramiﬁed point exists at a location away from
the ﬁber on the circle, which is then equivalent to a line segment after it splits open
using its ramiﬁcation the circle into two pieces as it has to be branched. The singular
points are absorbed by the branches and the two pieces are glued on top of each other,
which removes the branches. The volume to inﬁnity of the punctured 2-sphere is the
complex plane and the ﬁber to the circle becomes trivial in this limit. This results in
a thirteen dimensional spacetime.

39

A conformal ﬁeld description can be given to the eleventh dimension which is
compatible with eleven dimensional supergravity. Put a spin-1, spin-2, spin-3/2, and
spin-1/2 ﬁeld with 2d/2 components on the circle which also contains the singularity
of order two. The degenerate limit completes the eleven dimensional supergravity. A
ﬁve form is added with one component ﬁbered over the eleventh branch cut, due to
disingularizing the two unramiﬁed points into an eleventh dimensional branch with
a spin ﬁeld at x11 =
1 which
is oriented in the opposite direction. Desingularizing the non-trivial ﬁber of the ﬁve-
form on both branch cuts requires ﬁxing the fourth and ﬁfth components on top of the
branch, losing its ﬁeld content. The three form is then used to ﬁll out the topological
degrees of freedom in the supergravity lagrangian. The ﬁve-form is relevant to carry
over its and other degrees of freedom via supersymmetry to the IIB theory.

1 and another one in the tenth coordinate at x11 =

±

±

The two theories in 11 and 13 dimensions can be given consistent conformal ﬁeld
descriptions. In the ﬁrst case there are ten ﬂat spacetime dimensions and a compact
circle of inﬁnite radius ﬁbered over the eleventh coordinate, with an unramiﬁed point
added to the circle. The point at inﬁnity is unramiﬁed and stolen; together with the
unramiﬁed point at the origin, a singularity of order two is sitting at the origin of the
eleventh dimension.

Rather than this description, the point is ramiﬁed to the origin of the eleventh
dimension as the circle ﬁber is non-trivial. As the circle ﬁber is taken to have inﬁnite
radius, the point at inﬁnity is stolen, unramiﬁed, and moved on top of the ramiﬁed
point at the origin of the tenth dimension. Together the two points resolve a Taub-
NUT class A singularity with a bolt and a nut, thus unramifying the formerly ramiﬁed
point. The two unramiﬁed points are moved back onto the circle and placed at
the origin. As the ﬁber becomes non-trivial the coordinate completes the ﬂat space
eleventh dimensional spacetime. Both this limit and the one in the previous paragraph
lead to the same result.

In the thirteenth dimensional example a conformal ﬁeld model can be presented
based on the black hole work [47] together with that in [1]. Consider a black hole
wound around the S1 with a U(1) (charge) ﬁber extending outward, in the other
non-compact direction. T-duality changes these the U(1) ﬁber with the other non-
compact direction, which can be thought of as a wormhole due to a singularity at
the origin of the S1; this is due to the non-trivial π1 and the winding of the soliton
solution and its ﬁber. This blackhole and its wormhole relative have a description in
terms of a holographic massive topological conformal ﬁeld theory. Consider a WZW
model at level 1 and its central extension; the former is described

40

S =

Z

d3x εµνρWµWνWρ +

d2x√g gµνW µ∂2W ν ,

Z

(55)

with Wµ a spin ﬁeld transforming in the 1/2 representation. The central extension is
given by the usual mass term in three dimensions,

S = Z

d3x εµνρWµWνWρ + Z

d2x√g gµνW µm2W ν .

(56)

Both terms are included to preserve a transcendental symmetry so that upon m2 =
k2 the action of the combined terms vanishes. This conﬁguration describes a self-

−
dual wormhole that vanishes at the radius by momentum conservation.

±

For consistency, the compatibiity with eleven dimensional supergravity is ex-
plained. Throw away the topological term; then dimensionally reduce the spin ﬁeld
Wµ (recall that in 2-d, spin 1/2 is equivalent to spin 0). The mass term has m2 = 2πn.
Take n = 1, which labels this sector as the d = 11 supergravity limit one. Absorb
the 2π by a ﬁeld redeﬁnition; this is possible in another sector, but not all sectors
simultaneously. The spin reduction generates the ﬁeld content (2, 3/2, 1) with the
counting (1, 2, 1) of the degrees of freedom. Take the reduced spin ﬁeld and branch
1 over the individual components.
it over the two Riemann surfaces with the spin
As the two surfaces are equal except for being diameterically opposite, project one to
the other and mutiply the components by a factor of two. There are eight homology
generators on the elliptic genus three hypersurface. This means that in light-cone
gauge the gravitational multiplet in d = 10 should extend to d = 11, and by super-
symmetry the Noether current is subtended by a factor of three for dimensions, which
become ﬂat at large radius except for small corrections. This explains the origin of
the ﬁeld theory limit in from the d = 13 corner. The three-form arises by multiply-
ing the individual components to make a three-form or by Hodge duality an 8-form
by wedging all the components together; this shows that the topological term is not
fundamental but rather a consequence of duality involving the three-form on the S3,
which is homotopically equivalent to a three-sphere. The duality extends holomor-
phically to the product of the three-sphere together with the d = 2 Riemann surfaces,
which becomes a 7-sphere. The eight components of the spin ﬁeld span the individual
components subject to a constraint that light-cone tells us is spin independence, i.e.
two independent spin structures generate the same spin content. This condition is
reﬂected in the topological aspect of the three-form, as the former does not require a
metric to distinguish the spin dynamics on the S7 in a strong sense.

41

The ﬁbered S3 has a maximum invariance without the topological sector of E4.
The topological sector includes two copies of the graded Lie algebra E1, which pos-
sesses a transﬁnite representation; the Z2 breaks this down to E1, which is interesting
as the E4 has two Cartan generators, enough to specify the indices a and b in the
representation content La,b. Upon extending the S3 ﬁber bundle to encompass one
non-compact dimension such as the tenth, the E4 becomes an E6 broken down to E5
because there is no point at inﬁnity. The E5 when taken as a semi-direct product
with the single exceptional Lie algebra E1, can be maximally extended into the gauge
symmetry algebra of E11,11 and is non-compact and isomorphic to the 3-ball. This is
the purported maximum symmetry of M-theory, however, it is theoretically possible
to extend further by including the remaining E1 which was projected out by a discrete
homomorphism. In doing so, the symmetry algebra becomes E13,13, which has not
been constructed yet, if possible; the Z2 becomes one of the generators in the exten-
sion and in the surface parameterization, thus restricting its action to a hypersurface.
This should be the maximum symmetry, as pertinent to the work here.

Reshuﬄing the indices on the representation labels, the eigenvalues of the two
Casimirs of E4, can lead to a group theoretic understanding of the representation
numbers of La,b. However, once this is done there is a complication in the transﬁnite
math that leads to the labeling in the ﬁrst place analogous to reshuﬄing the spin
representations of the Lorentz group which is simpler when the Poincare group is
used in conjunction with the Pauli-Lubanski operator. Here (a, b) are two Casimir
eigenvalues of the E4 and take on values which are integer multiples of a number in
the string theory application. The numbers are ordered into a > b by a similarity
transformation which has action on the pairwise path integral and coherence path
integral, together with the inﬁnite tower of representations following the triples de-
scribed earlier. This matrix is the Fubini-Study matrix of the transﬁnite extension
of the S2 without altering its complex structure; transﬁnite here means that several
points were added to the S2, without altering its metric or complex form (after delet-
ing a point) [45]. This means that the matrix can be represented on the plane without
boundary as a complex number; this also means that there is a non-linear ﬁeld redef-
inition of string theory so that the representations enter Jordan normal form, or that
the matrix is diagonal. The Jordan normal form can be thought of as a reduction of
the classiﬁcation of the representations La,b if one thinks of the transﬁnite operations
as conformal transformations in the complex plane, as discussed in the ﬁrst section.
Having only diagonal elements indicates that there is no central charge and thus no
Weyl anomaly in the critical superstring, but rather from the target space-time point
of view; this is also in the presence of three extra dimensions, which would naively

42

E8 and O(n)(32) models, which would have
signal a c = 3 anomaly except in the E8 ×
an c = 6 anomaly. The Jordan normal form could also simplify the dynamics even in
non-trivial backgrounds.

The S1 ﬁber must contain a chiral boson [57] in order for the transﬁnite symmetry
to have a central extension apparently. This chiral boson transforms like a scalar
under the action of Poincare translations and as a Lorentz multiplet of spin (1/2, 0)
under Lorentz transformations in d = 11. The scalar seems to be required as the
d = 2 sphere is holomorphically equivalent to the plane with the point removed and
placed on the 1-sphere as an unramiﬁed point; the topology suggests that the radius
is the aﬃne parameter α and the chiral bosons partition function when interpreted as
a conformal ﬁeld theory enhances to an SU(2) thus generating a conformal block with
three primary towers. These towers generate the indices of the La,b in an SL(2, Z)
invariant manner without any obstruction due to the chiral nature of the partition
function; there is no anomaly if the point is placed at the origin, and the partition
function is a scalar with a factor of 1/2 multiplying the modes. This is T-dual

transﬁnite number theory as it is often associated with the last non-transcendentally
solvable polynomial system, i.e. a quartic. It is conjectured that the expansion of the
partition function into a series, as in [16], will generate all string related transﬁnite
representations. The factor of 4 signiﬁes that there are three contributions, the gauge
and gravity, the ghost, and the matter components; also the Hardy-Littlewood result
stating that one can replace 4 with 2 prevents the numbers in the series expansion to
grow without bound and has practical application in the computations (even replacing
4 with 1 appears reasonable if the computation is such that the terms in the series
contributing to a speciﬁc xN are collected appropriately).

XVI. Summary and Outlook

The superstring and its moduli space have been described with the goal of elu-
3In type IIB a similar partition appears with a factor of 2 and generates the full contribution to the
four-point function, with similar partition functions describing higher-point amplitude contributions.
However, a result due to Hardy-Littlewood states that these partition functions are equal if the mode
oscillators are normalized with that of the partition function of the one with a factor of 2 or 1; this
appears trivial.

Apparently, if the tangent space of the S1 plus a point has its tangent space replaced with the
tanget space of an S1 so there is no holomorphy then the IIB partition function in [16] is obtained,
and this signals the transﬁniteness of the IIB superstring without the circle ﬁber, which has been
reduced to a point so that string modes cannot propagate on it.

cidating its M-theory relation as well as its exact solvability. In all cases, the exact
S-matrix is constructed in terms of transﬁnite representations and certain moduli
forms that satisfy a diﬀerential equation on a corner of moduli space. This work has
simpliﬁed the approach to scattering so much that now it is possible to simply write
down the S-matrix; this is advantageous for practical computing.

Phenomenology of the superstring, primarily in the IIB and exceptional heterotic,
is described. The required ﬁve-form ﬂux has to be distributed in the compactiﬁed
spacetime and moduli space; this places constraints on the scenarios, some of which
are described. The higher dimenional spacetime of S1
S3 appears to be one of
the simplest realistic conﬁgurations, including possible quantization of the radii due
to the quantized but ordered amount of ﬂux on the circles. This scenario is improved
by the resolution of a singularity at the origin of the R4, and this has implicatons for
cosmology. In this stable compactiﬁcation the realistic mass value generation of the
fundamental ﬁelds such as fermions are given.

It is possible to interpret the moduli space as a higher dimensional inclusion
to the ten dimensional spacetime. Thirteen dimensions are required as the moduli
space is three beyond the critical superstring dimension. There are a few bubbles of
empty space that exist in this three-dimensional world, and they are partly populated
with strings that quantum tunnel back and forth between the ten-dimensional and
the three-dimensional space. The stability of this conﬁguration, which requires the
quantum coherence eﬀect, is excellent and can be used as a further guide in ﬁnding
the exact orientation of the three-dimensional conﬁguration in various phases of string
theory; vacuum selection is eliminated by including the coherence part of the energy.
WMAP data appears to indicate that the above picture is correct [60].

The exact form of the scattering in any non-trivival theory usually has impact
in other ﬁelds, including mathematics. The exact solution of all of the superstring
theories, in uncompactiﬁed spacetime and where its clear, in compactifations such as
tori or Calabi-Yau manifolds with toric moduli spaces, should have similar impact.
Indeed, there are dozens of results following from solving the superstring theories.

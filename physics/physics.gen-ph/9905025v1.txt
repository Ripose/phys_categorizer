Abstract

Recent results that an assembly of Fermions below the Fermi tem-
perature would exhibit anomalous semionic behaviour are examined
in the context of associated magnetic ﬁelds.

Recently it was shown that [1] below the Fermi temperature Fermions exhibit
an anomalous Bosonization: They obey statistics in between the Fermi-Dirac
and Bose-Einstein.
In general given an assembly of N Fermions, if N+ is the average number of
particles with spin up, the magnetisation is given by [2],

where µ is the electron magnetic moment. In the usual theory, N+ ≈ N
that m given in (1) is small. However semionic statistics implies

2 so

m = µ(2N+ − N),

N+ = βN,

< β < 1,

(1)

(2)

As N is generally very large, infact the number of particles is ∼ 1023 per cc
or more, the use of inequality (2) in (1) can give appreciable values for m.
In other words given such an assembly of Fermions, the introduction of,
for example, an uniform magnetic ﬁeld B would lead to an energy creation
∼ mB, where initially the Fermion assemhbly had negligible magnetism.

Moreover the semionic behaviour could result in magnetic reversals, if for
example the external ﬁeld B changed its direction.
The relevance of the above considerations is varied. It must be mentioned
that in diﬀerent conditions, the Fermi temperature of the assembly itself
would have a very wide spectrum starting from small values. For example,
in Neutron stars the Fermi temperature ∼ 107K, while in the solid core of
the earth it is ∼ 104. In these cases N ∼ 1058 and 1048 respectively. Indeed
in both these cases the prevalent magnetic ﬁeld follows from (1) [3].
Similarly the magnetism of the planet Jupiter can also be explained by (1).
In the case of the earth there are magnetic reversals which are usually at-
tributed to the liquid core activity of the earth, though there is no convinc-
ing explanation. Interestingly the Mars Global Surveyor space craft detected
such magnetic reversals on Mars also, in the last week of April, 1999. Mars
has no liquid core and tectonic activity so that, in conventional theory, this
would point to a much earlier epoch of such possible activity. However this
is not required in the scenario presented above.

Abstract
After reviewing the basic role of Lie’s theory for the mathematics and physics of
this century, we identify its limitations for the treatment of systems beyond the
local-diﬀerential, Hamiltonian and canonical-unitary conditions of the original
conception. We therefore outline three sequential generalized mathematics intro-
duced by the author under the name of iso-, geno- and hyper-mathematics which
are based on generalized, Hermitean, non-Hermitean and multi-valued units, re-
spectively. The resulting iso-, geno- and hyper-Lie theories, for which the new
mathematics were submitted, have been extensively used for the description of
nonlocal-integral systems with action-at-a-distance Hamiltonian and short-range-
contact non-Hamiltonian interactions in reversible, irreversible and multi-valued
conditions, respectively. We then point out that conventional, iso-, geno- and
hyper-Lie theories are unable to provide a consistent classical representation of
antimatter yielding the correct charge conjugate states at the operator counter-
part. We therefore outline yet novel mathematics proposed by the author under
the names of isodual conventional, iso-, geno- and hyper-mathematics, which
constitute anti-isomorphic images of the original mathematics characterized by
negative-deﬁnite units and norms. The emerging isodual generalizations of Lie’s
theory have permitted a novel consistent characterization of antimatter at all lev-
els of study, from Newton to second quantization. The main message emerging
after three decades of investigations is that the sole generalized theories as invari-
ant as the original formulation, the sole usable in physics, are those preserving
the original abstract Lie axioms, and merely realizing them in broader forms.

1. Majestic Consistency of Lie’s Theory.
Since I was ﬁrst exposed to the theory of Marius Sophus Lie [1] during my
graduate studies in physics at the University of Torino, Italy, in the 1960’s,
I understood that Lie’s theory has a fundamental character for the virtual
entire contemporary mathematics and physics.

I therefore dedicated my research life to identify the limitations of Lie’s
theory and construct possible generalizations for physical conditions broader
In this paper I outline the most
than those of the original conception.
salient aspects of this scientiﬁc journey (as representative references, see my
original papers in the ﬁeld [3], mathematical studies [4], physical studies [5],
monographs [6], applications and experimental veriﬁcations [7-10]).

Let F = F (a, +, ×) be a ﬁeld of conventional numbers a (real, complex
or quaternionic numbers) with conventional sum +, (associative) product
×) additive unit 0 and multiplicative unit I. When formulated on a Hilbert
space H over F, the physically most important formulation of Lie’s theory
is that via connected transformations of an operator A on H over F in the
following ﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal forms and interconnecting conjugation

A(w) = U × A(0) × U † = eiX×w × A(0) × e−iw×X,

idA/dw = A × X − X × A = [A, X]operator,

As it is well known, Lie’s theory is at the foundation of the mathematics
of this century, including topology, vector and metric spaces, functional
analysis, diﬀerential equations, algebras and groups, geometries, etc.

2

As it is also well know, Lie’s theory is at the foundation of all physical
theories of this century, including classical and quantum mechanics, parti-
cle physics, nuclear physics, superconductivity, chemistry, astrophysics, etc.
In fact, whenever the parameter w represents time t, Eqs. (1.1) are the
celebrated Heisenberg equations of motion in ﬁnite and inﬁnitesimal form,
while Eq.s (1.2) are the classical Hamilton equations, also in their ﬁnite and
inﬁnitesimal forms. Characterization via Lie’s theory of all classical and
operator branches of physics then follows.

A reason for the majestic consistency of Lie’s theory most important
for physical applications is that of being form invariant under the trans-
formations of its own class. In fact, connected Lie groups (1.1a) constitute
unitary transforms on H over F,

U × U † = U † × U = I,

(1.3)

under which we have the following invariance laws for units, products and
eigenvalue equations

I → U × I × U † = I ′ = I,

(1.4a)

A×B → U ×(A×B)×U † = (U ×A×U †)×(U ×B ×U †) = A′ ×B′, (1.4b)
H×|ψ >= E×|ψ >→ U×H×|ψ >= (U×H×U †)×(U×|ψ >) = H ′×|ψ′ >=
U × E × |ψ >= E′ × |ψ′ >, E′ = E.

(1.4c)

with corresponding invariances at the classical level here omitted for brevity.
It then follows that Lie’s theory possesses numerically invariant units,
products and eigenvalues, thus verifying the necessary condition for physi-
cally consistent applications.

2. Initial Proposals of Generalized Theories.
Despite the above majestic mathematical and physical consistency, by no
means Lie’s theory can represent the totality of systems existing in the
universe.
In fact, inspection of structures (1.1) and (1.2) reveals that,
in its conventional formulation, Lie’s theory can only represent isolated-
conservative-reversible systems of point-like particles with only potential-
Hamiltonian internal interactions. In fact, the point-like structure is de-
manded by the local-diﬀerential character of the underlying topology; the

3

isolated-conservative character of the systems is established by the fact that
the brackets [A, B] of the time evolution are totally antisymmetric, thus
implying conservation laws of total quantities; the sole potential character
is established by the representation of systems solely via a Hamiltonian;
and the reversibility is established by the fact that all known action-at-a-
distance interactions are reversible in time (i.e., their time reversal image
is as physical as the original one, as it is the case for the orbit of a planet).
All admissible interactions are represented via time-independent potentials
V in the Hamiltonian H = p2/2m + V , resulting in manifestly reversible
systems.

I therefore initiated a long term research program aiming at general-
izations (I called liftings) of Lie’s theory suitable for the representation of
broader systems.

The ﬁrst lifting I proposed as part of my Ph.D. thesis [3a,3b] back in
1967 is that for the representation of open-nonconservative systems, that
is, systems whose total energy H is not conserves in time, idH/dt 6= 0,
because of interactions with the rest of the universe. This called for the
formulation of the theory in such a way that its brackets are not totally
antisymmetric. In this way I proposed, apparently for the ﬁrst time in 1967,
the broader (p-q)-parametric deformations (known in more recent times as
the q-deformations),

A(w) = U × A(0) × U † = eiw×p×X × A(0) × e−iw×q×X, X = X †,

(2.1a)

idA/dw = p × A × X − q × X × A = (A, X)operator,

(2.1b)

where p, q and p + / − q are non-null parameters, with classical counterpart
[3c]

A(w) = U ×A(0)×U t = e−w×q×(∂X/∂rk)×(∂/∂pk)×A(0)×ew×p×(∂/∂rk)×(∂X/∂pk ),

Prior to releasing papers [3a] for publication, I spent about one year in

(a generally nonassociative algebra with product (A, B) is said to be Lie-
admissible when the attached algebra with antisymmetric product [A, B] =
(A, B) - (B, A) is Lie). At the time of proposal [3a] only three papers had
appeared in Lie-admissible algebras and only in the mathematical literature
(see Ref. [3a]).

The (p, q)-parametric deformations (2.1), (2.2) did indeed achieve the
desired objective. In fact, the total energy and other physical quantities are
not conserved by assumption, because idH/dt = (p − q) × H × H 6= 0.

In 1968 I emigrated with my family to the U. S. A, where I soon dis-
covered that Lie-admissible theories were excessively ahead of their time
because unknown in mathematical, let alone physical circles. Therefore, for
a number of years I had to dedicated myself to more mundane research
along the preferred lines of the time.

When I passed to Harvard University in 1978 I resumed research on
Lie-admissibility and proposed the most general possible (P, Q)-operator
Lie-admissible theory according to the operator structures [3d]

A(w) = U × A(0) × U † = eiw×X×Q × A(0) × e−iw×P ×X, X = X †, P = Q†,
(2.3a)
(2.3b)

idA/dw = A × P × X − X × Q × A = (Aˆ,X)operator,

where P, Q, andP + / −Q are non-singular matrices (or operators) such that
P-Q characterizes Lie brackets, with classical counterpart [3d]

(2.4b)

A primary motivation for generalizations (2.3) and (2.4) over (2.1) and
(2.2) is that the latter constitute nonunitary-noncanonical transforms. The
application of a nonunitary transform to Eqs. (2.1) then yields precisely
Eqs. (2.3) with P = p × (U × U †)−1 and Q = q × (U × U †)−1, as we shall
see better below. The application of any additional nonunitary transform
then preserves the Lie-admissible structure. A similar case occurs for the
classical counterpart.

5

Additional studies established that structures (2.3) constitute the most
general possible transformations admitting an algebra in the inﬁnitesimal
form. In particular, the product (Aˆ,B) results to be jointly Lie- and Jordan
admissible, although the attached Lie and Jordan algebras are more general
than the conversional forms.

The latter generalized character permitted me to propose a particular-
ization of the above Lie-admissible theory I called Lie-isotopic [3d,3r] , in
which the brackets did verify the Lie axioms, but are more general then the
conventional versions, with operator formulation

A(w) = U × A(0) × U † = eiX×T ×w × A(0) × e−iw×T ×X, ˆT = hatT †, (2.5a)

idA/dw = A × T × X − X × T × A = [Aˆ,X]operator,

(2.5b)

and classical counterpart [3d,3r]]

A(w) = e−w×(∂X/∂ri)×T i

(2.6b)

As one can see, the latter theories too are nonunitary-noncanonical, and
the application of additional nonunitary-noncanonical transforms preserves
the Lie-isotopic character. This establishes that transformations (2.5), (2.6)
are the most general possible ones admitting a Lie algebra in the brackets
of their inﬁnitesimal versions.

3. Inconsistencies of Initial Generalizations.
Following the proposals of theories (2.1)-(2.6), I discovered that, even though
mathematically intriguing and signiﬁcant, the above Lie-isotopic and Lie-
admissible theories had no physical applications. This is due to the fact
that all the broader theories considered have a nonunitary structure at the
operator level with a noncanonical structure st the classical counterpart.

In the transition from unitary to nonunitary theories, invariances (1.4)

are turned into the following noninvariances,

U × U † = U † × U 6= I,

(3.1a)

6

I → U × I × U † = I ′ 6= I,
A × B → U × (A × B) × U † =
(U × A × U †) × (U × U †)−1 × (U × B × U †) = A′ × T × B′, T = (U × U †)−1,
(3.1c)
H×|ψ >= E×|ψ >→ U×H×|ψ >= (U×H×U †)×(U×U †)−1×(U×|ψ >) =

(3.1b)

H ′ × T × |ψ′ >= U × E × |ψ >= E′ × |ψ′ >, E′ 6= E,

(3.1d)

It then follows that all theories with a nonunitary structure have the
following physical inconsistencies studied in detail in Refs. [12]: 1) nonuni-
tary theories do not have invariant units of time, space, energy, etc., thus
lacking any physically meaningful applications to measurements (for which
the invariance of the basic units is a necessary pre-requisite); 2) nonunitary
theories do not preserve in time the original Hermiticity of operators, thus
having no physically acceptable observables; 3) nonunitary theories do not
have invariant conventional and special functions and transforms, thus lack-
ing unique and invariant numerical predictions; nonunitary theories violate
probability and causality laws; nonunitary theories are incompatible with
Galilei’s and Einstein’s relativities; and suﬀer from other serious shortcom-
ings. Similar inconsistencies exist at the classical level.

Corresponding mathematical inconsistencies also occur [12f,12g]. In fact,
nonunitary theories are generally formulated on a conventional metric or
Hilbert space deﬁned over a given ﬁeld which, in turn, is based on a given
unit I. But the fundamental unit is not left invariant by nonunitary trans-
forms by conception. It them follows that the entire mathematical structure
of nonunitary theories becomes inapplicable for any value of the parameters
diﬀerent than the initial values.

It should be noted that the above catastrophic inconsistencies also hold
for any other theory departing from Lie’s theory, yet formulated via con-
ventional mathematics, such as deformations, Kac-Moody algebras, super-
algebras, etc. [12].

After systematic studies I realized that the only possibility to reach
invariant formulations of generalized Lie theories was that of constructing
new mathematics speciﬁcally conceived for the task at hand.

Since no other mathematics was available for the representation of the
broader theories here considered, as a physics I had to initiate long and

7

laborious mathematical studies in constructing the new mathematics, as a
pre-requisite for conducting physical research.

Predictably, the task resulted to be more diﬃcult than I suspected. In
fact, after having lifted all the essential aspects of conventional mathematics
(such as numbers and ﬁelds, vector and metric spaces, algebras and groups,
geometries, etc.) [3s] into the needed broader form, I continued to miss the
crucial invariance.

Insidiously, the problem resulted to exist where I was expect it the least,
in the ordinary diﬀerential calculus.
It was only in memoir [3i] of 1966
that I ﬁnally achieved invariance following suitable liftings of the ordinary
diﬀerential calculus. The reader is therefore warned that all papers on Lie-
isotopic and Lie-admissible theories prior to memoir [3i] have no consistent
physical applications because they lack invariance.

The invariant liftings of Lie’s theory which resulted from these eﬀorts

can be summarized as follows.

4. Lie-Santilli Isotheory.
The main idea [3d] is the lifting the conventional, trivial, n-dimensional unit
I = diag. (1, 1, ..., 1) of Lie’s theory into a real-values, nowhere singular
and positive-deﬁnite n × n-dimensional matrix ˆI, called isounit (where the
preﬁx ”iso-” means ”axiom-preserving”), with an unrestricted functional
dependence on time t, coordinates r = (rk), momenta p = (pk), k = 1, 2,
3, wavefunctions ψ, and any other needed variable,

I = diag.(1, 1, ..., 1) → ˆI(t, r, p, ψ, ...) = 1/ ˆT 6= I.

(4.1)

The applicable mathematics, called isomathematics, is the lifting of the
totality of conventional mathematics (with a well deﬁned unit), without any
exception known to me, into a new form admitting ˆI, rather than I, as the
correct left and right unit. This calls for:

1) The lifting of the associative product A×B amon g generic quantities
A, B (such as numbers, vector-ﬁelds, operators, etc.) into the form, called
isoassociative product, for which ˆI is indeed the left and right unit,

A × B → A ˆ×B = A × ˆT × B, ˆI ˆ×A = A × ˆ× ˆI = A;

(4.2)
2) The lifting of ﬁelds F = F (a, +, ×) into the isoﬁelds ˆF = ˆF (ˆa, ˆ+. ˆ×)
of isonumbers ˆa = a × ˆI (isoreal, isocomplex and isooctonionic numbers)

8

with isosum ˆa ˆ+ˆb = (a + b) × ˆI, isoproduct ˆa ˆ×ˆb = (a × b) × ˆI, isoquotient
ˆaˆ/ˆb = (ˆa/ˆb) × hatI, etc. (see [3h] for details) ;

3) The lifting of functions f(r) on F into isofunctions ˆf (ˆr) on ˆF , such as
the isoexponentiation ˆe ˆA = ˆI + ˆA/1!+ ˆA ˆ× ˆA/2!+... = (e ˆA× ˆT ) × ˆI = ˆI ×(e ˆT × ˆA,
and related lifting of transforms into isotransforms (see [3i,3s] for details);
4) The lifting of the ordinary diﬀerential calculus into the isodiﬀerential
calculus, with basic rules ˆdˆrk = ˆI k
k × dˆpi (because rk and pk
are deﬁned on isospaces with isometrics inverse of each other), isoderivatives
ˆ∂/ ˆ∂ˆri = ˆT j
j × ˆI, etc.(see
[3i] for details);

k × ∂/∂ ˆpi, ˆ∂ˆri/ ˆ∂ˆrj = ˆδi

i × ∂/∂ˆrj, ˆ∂/ ˆ∂ ˆpk = ˆI i

i × dˆri, ˆdˆpk = ˆT i

j = δi

5) The lifting of conventional vector, metric and Hilbert spaces into their
isotopic images, e.g., the lifting of the Euclidean space E(r, δ, R) with local
coordinates r = (rk) and metric δ = Diag.(1, 1, 1) into the isoeuclidean
spaces ˆE(ˆr, ˆδ, ˆR) with isocoordinates ˆr = r × ˆI and isometric ˆδ = ˆT × δ
over the isoreals ˆR, or the lifting of the Hilbert space H with inner product
< | × | > ×I over the complex ﬁeld C into the isohilbert space ˆH with
isoinner product < | ˆ×| > × ˆI over the isocomplex ﬁeld ˆC; etc. (see [3s] for
details).

6) The lifting of geometries and topologies into their corresponding iso-

topic images (see [3n] for details);

7) The isotopic lifting of all various branches of Lie’s theory, such as the
liftings of: universal enveloping associative algebras (including the Poincar´e-
Birkhoﬀ-Witt theorem), Lie’s algebras (including Lie’s ﬁrst, second and
third theorems); Lie’s groups, transformation and representation theory,
etc.

The main operator formulation of the Lie-Santilli isotheory can be writ-

and unique interconnecting map called isosymplectic quantization [3s].

A most salient feature of the Lie-Santilli isotheory is that it is form in-
variant under all possible nonunitary transforms, thus achieving the funda-
mental physical objective indicated earlier. In fact, an arbitrary nonunitary
transform on H over F can always be uniquely written as the isounitary
transform on ˆH over ˆF ,

V × V † = ˆI 6= I, V = ˆV × ˆT 1/2, V × V † = ˆV ˆ× ˆV

ˆ† = ˆV

ˆ† ˆ× ˆV = ˆI,

(4.5)

under which we have the isoinvariance laws

ˆI → ˆV × ˆI × ˆV

ˆ† = ˆI ′ = ˆI,

(4.6a)

ˆA ˆ× ˆB → ˆV ˆ×( ˆA ˆ× ˆB) ˆ× ˆV ˆ† = ( ˆV ˆ× ˆA ˆ×V †) ˆ×( ˆV ˆ× ˆB ˆ× ˆV ˆ†) = ˆA′ ˆ× ˆB′,

ˆV ˆ× ˆE ˆ×| ˆψ >= ˆE′ ˆ×| ˆψ′ >, ˆE′ = ˆE,

(4.6b)

(4.6c)

with corresponding isoinvariances for the classical counterpart.

As one can see, isomathematics achieves the invariance of the numeri-
cal values of the isounit, isoproduct and isoeigenvalues, thus regaining the
necessary conditions for physical applications.

It is easy to prove that isohermiticity coincides with the conventional
Hermiticity. As a result, all conventional observables of unitary theo-
ries remain observables under isotopies. The preservation of Hermiticity-
observability in time is then ensured by the above isoinvariances. Detailed
studies conducted in Ref. [3l] established the resolution of all inconsistencies
of nonunitary theories.
By comparing Eqs.

(1.1)-(1.2) and (4.3)-(4.4) it is evident that the
Lie theory and the Lie-Santilli isotheory coincide at the abstract level by
conception and construction [3d,3i]. In fact, the latter can be characterized

10

by ”putting a hat” to the totality of quantities and operations of Lie’s theory
with no exception known to me (otherwise the invariance is lost).

Despite this mathematical similarity, the physical implications of the
Lie-Santilli isotheory are far reaching. By recalling that Lie’s theory is at
the foundation of all of physics, Eqs. (4.3) and (4.4) have permitted a struc-
tural generalization of the fundamental dynamical equations of classical and
quantum mechanics, superconductivity and chemistry into new disciplines
called isomechanics [3] isosuperconductivity [7] and isochemistry [8]. These
new disciplines essentially preserve the physical content of the old theo-
ries, including the preservation identically of the total conserved quantities,
but add internal nonhamiltonian eﬀects represented by the isounit that are
outside any hope of representation via Lie’s theory.

In turn, these novel eﬀects have permitted momentous advances in var-
ious scientiﬁc ﬁelds, such as the ﬁrst axiomatically consistent uniﬁcation of
electroweak and gravitational interactions [3k,3q].

An illustrative classical application of the Lie-Santilli isotheory is the
representation of the structure of Jupiter when considered isolated from the
rest of the Solar system, with action-at-a-distance gravitational and other
interactions represented with the potential V in the Hamiltonian H and
additional, internal contact-non-Hamiltonian interactions represented via
the isounit ˆI.

An illustrative operator application is given by novel structure models of
the strongly interacting particles (called hadrons) for which the theory was
constructed [3j]. In turn, the latter application has far reaching implications,
including the prediction of novel, clean subnuclear energies.

5. Lie-Santilli Genotheory.
The main insuﬃciency of the Lie-Santilli isotheory is that it preserves the
totally antisymmetric character of the classical and operators Lie brack-
ets, thus being unsuited for a representation of open-nonconservative sys-
tems.
In particular, despite the broadening of unitary-canonical theories
into nonunitary-noncanonical extensions, the fundamental problem of the
origin of the irreversibility of our macroscopic reality does not admit quan-
titative treatment via the Lie-Santilli isotheory because the latter theory
is also is structurally reversible (that is, the theory coincides with its time

11

reversal image for reversible Hamiltonians and isounits).

The resolution of this insuﬃciency required the broadening of the Lie-
Santilli isotheory into a form whose brackets are neither totally antisym-
metric nor totally symmetric.
In turn, the achievement of an invariant
formulation of the latter theory requires the construction of a new mathe-
matics I suggested back in 1978 [3d] under the name of genomathematics
(where the preﬁx ”geno” now stands for ”axiom-inducing”).

The main idea of genomathematics is the selection of two diﬀerent gener-
alized units called genounits, the ﬁrst ˆI > for the ordered multiplication to the
right A > B, called forward genoproduct, and the second < ˆI for the ordered
multiplication to the left A < B, called backward genoproduct, according to
the general rules [3d,3i,3l]

ˆI > = 1/ ˆS, A > B = A × ˆS × B, ˆI > > A = A > ˆI > = A,

< ˆI = 1/ ˆR, A < B = A × ˆR × B,< ˆI < A = A << ˆI = A,

A = A†, B = B†, ˆR = ˆS†

(5.1a)

(5.1b)

(5.1c)

A most important feature of the Lie-Santilli genotheory is its form in-
variance. This can be seen by noting that a pair of nonunitary transforms on
H over ˆC can always be identically rewritten as the genounitary transforms
on genohilbert spaces over genocomplex ﬁelds,

V ×V † 6= 1, V =< ˆV × ˆR1/2, V ×V † =< ˆV << ˆV † =< ˆV † << ˆV =< ˆI, (5.4a)

(5.4b)
under which we have indeed the following forward genoinvariance laws [3j]

ˆW > > ˆE> > | >= E × | >′,

(5.5b)

(5.5c)

with corresponding rules for the backward and classical counterparts.

The above rules conﬁrm the achievement of the invariance of the numer-
ical values of genounits, genoproducts and genoeigenvalues, thus permitting
physically consistent applications.

By recalling again that Lie’s theory is at the foundation of all of con-
temporary science, the Lie-Santilli genotheory has permitted an additional
structural generalization of classical and quantum isomechanics, isosuper-
conductivity and isochemistry into their genotopic coverings.

Intriguingly, the product ˆA < ˆB− ˆB > ˆA = ˆA× ˆR× ˆB− ˆB× ˆS× ˆA, ˆR 6= ˆS,
is manifestly non-Lie on conventional spaces over conventional ﬁelds, yet it
becomes fully antisymmetry and Lie when formulates on the bimodule of
the respective envelopes to the left and to the right, {< ˆA, ˆA>} (explicitly,
the numerical values of ˆA < ˆB = ˆA × ˆR × ˆB computed with respect to
< ˆI = 1/ ˆR is the same as that of ˆA > ˆB = ˆA × ˆS × ˆB when computed with
respect to ˆI > = 1/ ˆS) [3i,3l].

A primary feature of the broader classical and operator genotheories is
that it represents open-nonconservative systems, as desired, because now
the total energy H is not conserved in our spacetime, idH/dt = H × ( ˆR −
ˆS)×H 6= 0. Yet, the notion of genohermiticity on ˆH> over ˆC > coincides with
conventional Hermiticity. Therefore, the Lie-admissible theory provides the
only operator representation of open systems known to this author in which
the nonconserved Hamiltonian and other quantities are Hermitean, thus
observable. In other treatments of nonconservative systems the Hamiltonian
is generally nonhermitean and, therefore, not observable.

More importantly, genotheories have permitted a resolution of the histor-
ical problem of the origin of irreversibility via its reduction to the ultimate
possible layers of nature, such as particles in the core of a star. The in-
terested reader can ﬁnd the invariant genotopic formulations of: Newton’s
equations in Ref. [3i]; Hamilton’s equations with external terms in Ref. [3i];
quantization for open-irreversible systems in Ref. [3i,3l]; operator theory of
open-irreversible systems in Ref. [3l].

6. Lie-Santilli Hypertheory.
By no means genotheories are suﬃcient to represent the entirely of nature,
e.g., because they are unable to represent biological structures such as a
cell or a sea shell. The latter systems are indeed open-nonconservative-
irreversible, yet they possess a structure dramatically more complex than
that of a nonconservative Newtonian system. A study of the issue has
revealed that the limitation of genotheories is due to their single-valued
character.

As an illustration, mathematical treatments complemented with com-
puter visualization [10] have established that the shape of sea shells can
be well described via the conventional single-valued three-dimensional Eu-
clidean space and geometry according to the empirical perception of our
three Eustachian tubes. However, the same space and geometry are ba-
sically insuﬃcient to represent the growth in time of sea shells.
In fact,
computer visualization shows that, under the exact imposition of the Eu-
clidean axioms, sea shells ﬁrst grow in time in a distorted way and then
crack.

Illert [10] showed that a minimally consistent representation of the sea
shells growth in time requires six dimensions. But sea shells exist in our en-
vironment and can be observed via our three-dimensional perception. The
solution of this apparent dichotomy I proposed [10] is that via multi-valued
hypermathematics essentially characterized by the relaxation of the single-
valued nature of the genounits while preserving their nonsymmetric char-
acter (as a necessary condition to represent irreversible events), according
to the rules [3i,3t]

1 , ˆI >

ˆI > = { ˆI >

3 , ...} = 1/ ˆS,

2 , ˆI >
(6.1a)
A > B = {A× ˆS1×B, A× ˆS2×B, A× ˆS3×B, ...}, ˆI > > A = A > ˆI > = A×I,
(6.1b)
< ˆI = {< ˆI1,< ˆI2,< ˆI3, ...} = 1/ ˆR,
(6.1c)
A < B = {A× ˆR1×B, A×hatR2×B, A× ˆR3×B, ...}< ˆI < A = A << ˆI = I×A,
(6.1d)
(6.1e)

A = A†, B = B†, ˆR = ˆS†.

All aspects of the bimodular genotheories admit a unique, and signiﬁ-
cant extension to the above hyperstructures and their explicit form is here

15

omitted for brevity [3i,3t]. The expression of the theory via weak equalities
and operations was ﬁrst studied by Santilli and Vougiouklis in Ref. [11].

7. Isodual theories.
Mathematicians appear to be unaware of the fact that, contrary to popu-
lar beliefs, the totality of contemporary mathematics, including its isotopic,
genotopic and hyperstructural liftings, cannot provide a consistent classical
representation of antimatter. In fact, all these mathematics admit only one
quantization channel. As a result, the operator image of any classical treat-
ment of antimatter via these mathematics simply cannot yield the correct
charge conjugate state, but it merely yields a particle with the wrong sign
of the charge.

The occurrence should not be surprising because the study of antimat-
ter constitutes one of the biggest scientiﬁc unbalances of this century. In
fact, matter is treated at all possible mathematical and physical levels, from
Newton’s equations and underlying topology, all the way to second quanti-
zation and quantum ﬁeld theories, while antimatter is solely treated at the
level of second quantization. However, astrophysical evidence suggests quite
strongly the existence of macroscopic amounts of antimatter in the universe,
to the point that even entire galaxies and quasars could eventually result
to be made up entirely of antimatter.

The only possible resolution of this historical unbalance is that via the
construction of a yet new mathematics, speciﬁcally conceived for a consis-
tent classical representation of antimatter whose operator counterpart yields
indeed the correct charge conjugate states.

Recall that charge conjugation is anti-homomorphic, although solely ap-
plies at the operator level. It then follows that the new mathematics for
antimatter should be, more generally, anti-isomorphic and applicable at all
levels of study.

After a laborious research, I proposed back in 1985 [3g] the isodual math-
ematics, namely, mathematics constructed via the isodual map of numbers,
ﬁelds, spaces, algebras, geometries, etc..

The isodual conventional mathematics is characterized by the simplest
conceivable anti-isomorphic map of the unit into its negative-deﬁnite form,

I > 0 → −I = I d < 0,

(7.1)

16

under which we have the transformation law of a generic, scalar, real-valued
quantity

A(w) → Ad(wd) = −A(−w),

(7.2)

with reconstruction of numbers, ﬁelds, spaces, algebras, geometries, quan-
in such a way to admit I d, rather than I, as the correct left
tization, etc.
and right unit.

The isodual map characterizing the broader isodual iso-, geno- and

hyper-mathematics is instead given by

ˆI(ˆt, ˆr, ˆp, ˆψ, ...) → − ˆI †(−ˆt†, −ˆr†, −ˆp†, − ˆψ†, ...) = ˆI d(ˆtd, ˆrd, ˆpd, ˆψd, ...),

(7.3)

and consequential reconstruction of the entire formalism to admit ˆI d as the
correct left and right new unit.

The above map is not trivial, e.g., because it implies the reversal of the
sign of all physical characteristics of matter (and not only of the charge). As
such, isodual theories provide a novel intriguing representation of antimatter
which begins at the primitive classical Newtonian level, as desired, and then
persists at all subsequent levels, including that of second quantization, in
which case isoduality becomes equivalent to charge conjugation [3m].

The most general mathematics presented in this paper is the isoselfd-
ual hypermathematics [3i], namely, a hypermathematics that coincides with
its isodual, and is evidently given by hypermathematics multiplied by its
isodual. The latter mathematics has been used for one of the most gen-
eral known cosmologies [3p] inclusive of antimatter as well as of biological
structures (as any cosmology should be), in which the universe: has a multi-
valued structure perceived by our Eustachian tubes as a single-valued three-
dimensional structure; admits equal amounts of matter and antimatter (in
its limit formulation verifying Lies conjugation (1.1c)); removes any need for
the ”missing mass”; reduces considerably the currently believed dimension
of the measured universe; possesses all identically null total characteristics
of time, energy, linear and angular momentum, etc.; eliminates any singu-
larity at the time of creation.

8. Simple Construction of Generalized Theories.
Unpredictably, the need for new mathematics has been a major obstacle

17

for the propagation of the generalized Lie theories outlined in this paper in
both mathematical and physical circles.

I would like to indicate here that all generalized Lie theories, all their
underlying new mathematics and all their applications can be uniquely and
unambiguously constructed via the following elementary means accessible
to undergraduate students.

First, isotheories can be constructed via the systematic application of

the following nonunitary transform

U × U † = ˆI, (U × U †)−1 = ˆT ,

(8.1)

to the totality of the original formalism with no exceptions.

In fact, transform (8.1) yields the isonumbers U × n × U † = n × ˆI, the
isoproduct, U × (A × B) × U † = (U × A × U †) × (U × U †)−1 × (U × B × U †) =
A′ × ˆT × B′ = A′ ˆ×B′; the correct isofunctions, such as U × eX × U † = ˆe ˆX;
and the correct expression of all other aspects, including the Lie-Santilli
isotheory and its underlying basic theorems.

Once the isotopic structure has been achieved in this way, its invariance
is proved via the reformulation of nonunitary transforms in the isounitary
form (4.5), with consequential invariance of the isotheory as in Eqs. (4.6).
The construction of the Lie-Santilli genotheory is equally elementary,

and requires the use, this time, of two nonunitary transforms

U × U † 6= I, W × W † 6= I, U × W † = ˆI >, W × U † =< ˆI,

(8.2)

to the totality of the original formalism, again, without any exceptions.

In fact, transforms (8.2) yields the correct form of forward and backward
genonumbers, e.g., U × n × W † = n × ˆI >, the correct form of the forward
and backward genoproduct, genofunctions and genotransforms, including
the correct structure and representation of the Lie-Santilli genotheory. Once
reached in this way, the invariance is proved by rewriting the nonunitary
transforms in their genounitary version (5.4). Genoinvariant laws (5.5) then
follow.

The Lie-Santilli hypertheory can be constructed and proved to be invari-
ant via the mere relaxation of the single-valued character of the genounits.
The explicit construction is is here omitted for brevity [3t]).

18

Finally, the isodual Lie theory can be easily constructed via the system-

atic application of the anti-isomorphic transform

U × U † = −I = I d,

(8.3)

to the totality of the original formalism with no exceptions.

This yields isodual numbers, ﬁelds, products, functions, etc. The isod-
ualities of isotopic, genotopic and hyperstructural theories can be similarly
constructed via the anti-isomorphic images of the preceding transforms.

Note that the above methods is useful on both mathematical and physi-
cal grounds. On mathematical grounds one can start from one given struc-
ture, e.g., the representation of the conventional Poincar´e symmetry and
construct explicitly all inﬁnitely possible irreps of the Poincar´e-Santilli iso-,
geno- and hyper-symmetries as well as their isoduals [3,4].

The methods is also useful for the ongoing eﬀorts to unify all simple
Lie groups of the same dimension in Cartan’s classiﬁcation (over a ﬁeld of
characteristic zero) into one single isogroup, whose study has been initiated
by Gr. Tsagas and his group [4].

On physical grounds, the method presented in this section is also par-
ticularly valuable to generalize existing applications of Lie’s theory via the
appropriate selection of the nonunitary transform representing the missing
characteristics or properties, e.g., the representation of a locally varying
speed of light.

9. Ultimate Signiﬁcance of Lie’s Axioms.
A unitary Lie group has the structure of a bi-module in both its ﬁnite and
inﬁnitesimal forms with an action from the left U > = eiX×w and an action
from the the right <U = e−iw×X interconnected by Hermitean conjugation
(1.1c) [3e]. Eqs. (1.1) can then be written

A(w) = U > > A(0) << U = eiX×w > A(0) < e−iw×W ,

idA/dt = A < X − X > A,
<U = (U >)†, X = X †.

(9.1a)

(9.1b)

(9.1c)

In the Lie case both products A < B and A > B are evidently conven-
tional associative products, A < B = A > B = A × B, resulting in Lie’s

19

bimodule. However, axiomatic structure (9.1) does not require that such
products have necessarily to be conventionally associative, because they
can also be isoassociative, thus yielding the Lie-Santilli isotheory. Moreover,
axioms (9.1) do not require that the forward and backward isoassociative
products have to be necessarily the same, because they can also be diﬀer-
ent, provided that conjugation (9.1c) is met. In the latter case the axioms
yield the Lie-Santilli genotheory with an easy extension to the hypertheory
Isodual theories emerge along similar lines
via multi-valued realizations.
because axioms (9.1) do not necessarily demand that the underlying unit
be positive-deﬁnite.

It then follows that the axiomatic consistency and invariance of the gen-
eralized theories studied in this paper can be inferred from the original
invariance of Lie’s theory itself, of course, when treated with the the math-
ematics leaving invariant the basic units. The only applicable mathematics
are then the iso-, geno-, and hyper-mathematics and their isoduals.

In conclusion, by looking in retrospect some three decades of studies on
the topics outlined in this paper, the emerging most important message is
that the sole invariant classical and operator theories are those preserving
the abstract Lie axioms, Eq.s (1.1) and (1.2), and merely providing their
broder realizations treated with the appropriate mathematics.

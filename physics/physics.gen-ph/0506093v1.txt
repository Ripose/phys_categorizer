Abstract

The concept of Schwarzschild radius is extended to the photon and
the upper limit imposed on the energy of a photon as a result of the
three characteristics of the photon–the constancy of the velocity of
light, the spin value of 1ℏ and the zero rest mass of the photon—is
shown. Further the phase change that occurs to the photon at the
Schwarzschild radius, from energy to matter as a result of vacuum
ﬂuctuations is indicated.

The photon, as an elementary particle, is unique. It is the only elemen-
tary particle of energy whereas there are hundreds of elementary particles of
matter. There are three unique properties for the photon.

1. In the free space, the photon always propagates with the same constant
velocity, velocity of light c, irrespective of the energy it possesses.

2. The rest mass of the photon is zero.

3. The photon has a constant spin value of ℏ

In this short paper, we shall examine one remarkable consequence of the

above three properties of the photon.

The special theory of relativity postulates an upper limit [1] for the veloc-
ity of light in free space. We shall show that the upper limit of the velocity
of light puts an upper limit on the rotational angular velocity and hence on
the total energy possible for a photon.

Relativistic equation for the energy of a particle is given by the equation

E2 = p2c2 + m0c2

(1)

where

E = Energy of the particle
p = Momentum of the particle
c = velocity of light
m0 = Rest mass of the particle.
For a photon, the rest mass is zero and therefore the energy of the photon

is given by the equation

E2 = p2c2
It is well known that photon has one degree of freedom of rotation and two
degrees of freedom of translation [2, 3]. Since the photon has no rest mass,
the total energy of the photon must be stored as rotational kinetic energy
and translational kinetic energy.

(2)

The ﬁrst postulate of relativity [1] (or the Galilean invariance) states
that no object is aware of its motion when moving with uniform velocity
and light is no exception to this. Therefore, for the photon itself, moving
with the velocity of light, its kinetic energy due to translatory motion will
be zero. But this does not say that the photon does not exist for itself. The
photon has a kinetic energy of rotation and therefore the photon can feel its
existence. Incidentally, this also shows the necessity of a nonzero spin value
for any particle with zero rest mass. Therefore, from the point of view of
the photon itself, since the photon has no rest mass, the total energy of the
photon is stored as rotational kinetic energy. We can associate rotation even
to a particle with zero rest mass, provided the particle has spatial extension.

The energy of the photon is given by the expression

where h = the Planck’s constant, ν = the frequency of the photon, λ = the
wavelength of the photon.

(3)

E = hν =

hc
λ

The wavelength guarantees the extension of the photon. The expression
E = hc
λ shows that the greater the energy of the photon, the shorter its
wavelength. This implies that with the increase in the energy, the photon
will be more and more localized. Can this localization go on ad inﬁnitum?
The idea of inﬁnite amount of energy packed in an inﬁnitely small volume
is quite unphysical and it cannot be true. How is the property of the space
altered by the ever increasing energy density? Do the constant parameters ℏ
and c put an upper limit for the possible energy of a photon? What are the
consequences of this upper limit on the space time geometry?

The Harward Tower experiment [4] has clearly demonstrated that the
energy of a photon is increased under gravitational attraction. Can the en-
ergy of the photon be increased continuously without limit by gravitational
attraction? Since the photon itself cannot feel any increase in the transla-
tional kinetic energy, the increased energy of the photon, when attracted by
a gravitational ﬁeld, is entirely stored as rotational kinetic energy. Spin is
the quantum mechanical analogue of classical angular momentum. Since the
photon has a spin of 1 ℏ, we can attribute an angular momentum to the
photon in the semiclassical analysis.

When L, I and w are the angular momentum, moment of inertia and

angular velocity of a particle, we have the expression

When m, r and v are the mass, radius and velocity of the particle respectively,
we have

Special theory of relativity puts c as the upper limit for the velocity of any
signal. Therefore no particle can rotate with a tangential linear velocity v
greater than the velocity of light. When we put this limiting value of c to v
in equation (5), we have

When the particle we consider is the photon, L is replaced by the spin S of
the photon.

For a photon S = 1 ℏ

(4)

(5)

(6)

L = Iw

L = mrv

L = mrc

S = mrc

∴ 1 ℏ = mrc.

Here m is the equivalent mass of the photon due to its spin.

We assume that as in the case of material particles, the concept of Schwarzschild
radius is valid for the photon also.

The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is given by the expression

m =

ℏ

rc

r =

r
m

=

2Gm
c2
2G

(8)

(9)

The right hand side of the equation (9) is a constant. Therefore, for any
black hole, the increase in the radius must be accompanied by an increase in
the mass. But when we consider the photon as a black hole, Schwarzschild
radius is the minimum radius that a photon can have. In the case of material
particles, we can have black holes of varying masses with the corresponding
radii. This is possible because the right hand side value of equation (9)
can be maintained by proportional increase in the values of r and m. This
is impossible for the photon because for the photon, with the increase in
the equivalent mass, the radius decreases. Therefore, unlike in the case of
material particles, there is a unique value of radius and mass, for a photon
to behave as a black hole.

Substituting the value of the radius r from equation (8) into equation (7),

we get

m =

ℏc
2G

r

(10)

This is the expression for Planck mass. Planck mass is usually deﬁned as
the minimum mass corresponding to the Schwarzschild radius of a classical
particle. Planck mass, in the case of the photon, is the maximum equivalent
mass permitted for the photon.

We have

c = 2.998 × 108 m s−1
h = 6.62 × 10−34 Js
G = 6.67 × 10−11 N m2 kg

Substituting these values we get

The maximum energy possible for the photon will be

m = 1.54 × 10−7 kgs

mc2 =

ℏc
2G

r

= 8.61 × 1022 MeV.

(11)

The highest energy so far observed [5] for a photon is of the order of 1013 eV.
A simple dimensional analysis in terms of the Planck’s natural units will
be illuminating here. The dimension of energy is ML2T −2. When we substi-
tute for M, L and T in terms of c, G and h we get the expression

E = ML2T −2

What happens to the photon when the photon reaches its upper limit of
energy, having an equivalent mass equal to the Planck mass. Energy and
matter are two phases of the same physical entity. Hawking [6, 7] has shown
that in the case of primordial black holes, at the Schwarzschild radius, spon-
taneous pair production takes place. At the upper limit of energy permitted
for the photon, having reached the Schwarzschild radius, it may be legitimate
to presume that the photon will undergo pair production and transformed
to material particles. It is also an open question whether the photon at the
maximum energy limit can be disintegrated into many photons with smaller
energies and larger wavelengths in the turbulent sea of vacuum ﬂuctuations.
Of course these are pure speculations, either to be proved or disproved by
future theoretical and experimental studies.

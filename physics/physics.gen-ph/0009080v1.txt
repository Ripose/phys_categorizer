From the hypothesis of a quadratic dependence of the binding energy of the quarks on the length
scale and from the idea of a universal running coupling constant, we get the closure mass of the
Universe and the pion mass. Besides this, we propose a free energy for the pions which stationarity
condition leads to a closed form for the pion mass as a function of the Planck mass and of the
Hubble constant.

PACS numbers: 04.20.Cv, 04.70.-s

In a recent paper [1], was proposed a universal interaction between the quarks, running from the Universe gauge
factor a to the Planck length LP . In this way, the model of Skalsk´y and S´uken´ık as described in [1] comprises both
the asymptotic freedom and the quark conﬁnement. As pointed out by Gross in Ref. [5] the forces between the quarks
vary with the distance between them: the dynamics of the vacuum enhances the force at large distances, while at
short distances, the interaction grows weaker.

The assumption that the binding energy of conﬁned quarks increases quadratically [1] was a “ad hoc” hypothesis
in order to be consistent with the experimental ﬁndings. In this letter we intend to pursue further on this subject,
through somewhat more formal way. Let us represent the global behavior of the Universe as a bound system. In terms
of an average separation r between the particles with average momentum p we can write the classical Hamiltonian as

H =

p2
2µ

−

β¯hc

r

(1)

In (1), µ is the reduced mass of the Universe of mass M , and β is a scaling-dependent coupling constant, to be

deﬁned latter.

From the uncertainty relation, we have:

r =

¯h
p

Putting (2) in (1) and minimizing the obtained relation relative to p, we obtain the energy:

E = −

Although we are not working on the basis of a non-Abelian ﬁeld theory we can think in terms of a scaling-dependent
coupling constant which could exhibit both asymptotic freedom and conﬁnement. It seems that a simple achievement
of these requirements can be obtained by deﬁning

where r is the scale of the interaction.

Relation (4) into (3) leads to:

We see that the binding energy given by (5) has the desired dependence on the scaling of the interactions, namely:
the quadratic dependence on r. Let us now write Er in a more convenient way multiplying and dividing the r.h.s. of
equation (5) by L2

p. Thus,

Now we write the well known relations:

Er =

where M is the closure mass of the Universe, Ho and G are respectively the Hubble and the Gravitational constants,
and by substituting relations (7), (8) and (9) into (6) we obtain:

Er =

16π (cid:18) hc

Lp(cid:19)2

(10)

Despite our scaling-dependent coupling constant could lead to the sought dependence of the “binding” energy with

the scaling parameter r, we must permit a slight dependence of the βo parameter on r.

So, by putting β2

neighborhood of r = ¯h
S´uken´ık.

o = 16π into (10), we reproduce relation (3) of Skalsk´y and S´uken´ık, which works well in the
mπ c , and also gives Er(r = Lp) ≡ Emin, where Emin is given by relation (1) of Skalsk´y and

On the other hand the relation (2) of Skalsk´y and S´uken´ık, namely Emax = M c2, could be obtained from the
o = 4; r = a. This choice also reproduces the result found in [4] for

relation (6) of this paper only with the choice β2
the minimal energy, Er(r = Lp) = 1

2 ¯hH0, due the interaction between a particle and the rest of the Universe.

Now, let us suppose that we did not know any previous results and we want to ﬁx the parameter β2

o of (10) in the

neighborhood of r = ¯h

mπ c . So, as a means to ﬁx βo, we can make the following considerations:

2 ¯hωdB = 1

Recently one of the present authors [6] have found that to a particle of mass m we can associate a zero-point energy
given by 1
2 mc2, where ωdB is the de Broglie frequency. Then we can associate the diﬀerence between the
rest energy of a particle and this zero-point energy as an eﬀect of the thermal excitations. Let us suppose yet the pion
as a particle of surface of radius equal to Lπ = ¯h
mπ c behaving as an event-horizon surface to wich we can associate
a Bekenstein entropy [2,3]. We also assume that the pion is in thermal equilibrium with the matter of the Universe
with a temperature Tπ, given by:

where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Seeking for the condition of a stationary free energy for the pion in thermal
equilibrium with the Universe, we can write:

kBTπ =

¯hc
a

= ¯hHo

(11)

where F , U and S are respectively the free and the internal energies and the entropy of the pion.

Writing:

∆F = ∆U − Tπ∆S = 0

∆S =

kB
4

4π(cid:18) Lπ

Lp(cid:19)2

= πkB (cid:18) mp

mπ(cid:19)2

(12)

and

where Lp and mp are respectively the Planck radius and mass, we obtain:

∆U =

1
2

mπc2

mπc2 =

hc

a (cid:18) mp

mπ(cid:19)2

(13)

(14)

The above relation can also be obtained through relation (3) of [1] upon identifying E(r = Lπ) with the pion
rest energy. Naturally, in order to relation (10) of this paper be able to reproduce (14), we must make the choice
β2
o = 16π; r = Lπ.
It is intriguing to verify that by considering 1026m as the radius of the Universe, we get ∆SU = KBπ10122 as its
entropy, calculated according to the Bekenstein recipe, where we have considered the Universe as a black hole. On
the other hand, the entropy of the pion is given by ∆Sπ = KBπ1040. Therefore the ratio between these entropies is
equal to 1082, which is of the same order of magnitude of the number of hadrons of the Universe. In this way, the
entropy of the Universe, ∆SU (or SM AX [7]), turns out to be the (present) bound from above on entropy, as is the
case when we think on the grounds of Quantum Gravity [8].

It would be interesting to comment that in the case of (14) will prove to be an exact relation, it would be a way of
obtaining the accurate value of the radius of the Universe (or the Hubble constant), once the other quantities which
appear there are known with relatively great accuracy.

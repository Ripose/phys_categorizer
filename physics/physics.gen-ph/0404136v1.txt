Abstract

The appearance of the geometrodynamical version of the Pancharantam
phase factor in the polarization state of the monochromatic beam was system-
atically discarded during the topological phases measurements has been shown.
It means that not only topological structure of the transformation manifolds
has the physical signiﬁcance but the metric structure of the coherent state space
of its realization too. The comparison of the local dynamical variables over such
states is deﬁned through the parallel transport agrees with the Fubini-Study
metric. This parallel transport might be actual in the Qubit coding-encoding
processing of the quantum information.

Key words: gauge ﬁeld, coherent state, geometric phase, parallel transport

The topological character of the phases Berry [1, 2], Aharonov-Anandan [3, 4]
and Wilczek -Zee [5] arises as a macroscopic environment reaction on the quantum
dynamics of an “immersed” quantum system. The anholonomies of the “parallel
transport” of the state vector are expressed as some eﬀective gauge ﬁelds reﬂecting
the topological character of the transformation groups of orientations of macroscopic
elements (polarizers, λ/4 plates, etc.) of the quantum setup. Therefore it is not so
strange that there are close classical analogies of the topological phases in classical
physics (e.g. Hannay angle [2]). This is the reason why a dynamic phase should be
discarded in order to get deﬁnite geometric (topological) phase. Therefore in general

it is impossible of course to endow these gauge ﬁelds by some fundamental sense. But
such gauge ﬁelds may by really fundamental in two important cases being appear
into the complex projective state space CP (N − 1). Firstly, since we believe that
rays of quantum states are the fundamental notions at any level. Secondly, CP (1)
may be treated as the Qubit coherent state space under the quantum information
processing. In these cases arises a new geometrodynamics phase relates to the aﬃne
gauge ﬁeld. Corresponding gauge ﬁelds associated with the curvature of CP (N − 1)
will be state-dependent and they realize local gauge transformation of the moving
quantum frame in CP (N − 1) [6, 7, 8]. They are akin to the Wilczek-Shapere gauge
ﬁelds related to the problem of a deformable body swim [11].

Berry’s [1, 2] and Aharonov-Anandan [3, 4] the “parallel transport” laws of the
quantum state is deﬁned in original Hilbert space. This kind of the parallel transport
is not the object of the intrinsic geometry of neither a parameter space (Berry) nor
the projective Hilbert state spaces (Aharonov-Anandan); see for example discussion
in [12]. Intention of such deﬁnition is to discard dynamical phase shift and to extract
pure topological consequences of the rotations of polarizers, λ/4 plates, etc. However
there are some reasons to keep dynamics together with geometry [3, 6, 8]. In particular
the fundamental importance of the complex projective geometry of the state space
CP (N − 1) [4, 9, 10, 6, 7, 8] evokes necessity to work in the intrinsic geometry of
CP (N − 1) close connected with the quantum dynamics.

I will show the geometrodynamics of the light polarization states (the example
of the two-level system, N=2) would be restored by the cost of the path-dependent
parallel transport in the aﬃne connection agrees with the K¨ahlerian metric (Fubiny-
Study metric) in the particular case of the CP (1). The essential diﬀerences between
my approach and say approach of Anandan and Pati [13] are ﬁrstly, that I use the
parallel transport of the local in CP (1) dynamical variables instead of the quantum
state transport. Secondly, the geometric frequency I used is local and it is applicable
to any superposition state whereas the Anandan-Pati “reference-section” of the state
is bi-local and it is singular for the orthogonal initial and ﬁnal states.

I will start with the description of the model setup providing the unitary evolu-
tion of the polarization state of light. The ﬁxed Cartesian reference frame (O, x, y, z)
in physical space will be used.
Initially one has the light beam in the linear po-
larization state in x-direction |x >= 1
√2 (1, 1)T propagating
along z-axes. Then the diﬀerent polarization states will be expressed as follows:
|y >= 1
√2(−i, i)T , and then |R >= (1, 0)T , |L >= (0, 1)T . The co-
herent superposition state will be denoted as usually |Ψ >= (Ψ0, Ψ1)T . The Poincar´e

√2(|R > +|L >) = 1

sphere refers to the coordinates (o, s1, s2, s3) in iso-space of the polarization. In gen-
eral the coherence vector lays on the isotropy “light cone” s2
3 = 0 where
s2
0 = I 2 =< Ψ|Ψ > is the square of the beam intensity. It means the coherence vec-
tor may “dive” into the Poincar´e sphere under non-unitary evolution. I will restrict
myself by the unitary one.

The initial state |x > subjected the modulation by the passing through optically
active medium (say using the Faraday eﬀect in YIG ﬁlm magnetizing along the main
axes in z-direction by the harmonic magnetic ﬁeld with the frequency Ω and the
amplitude β). Formally this process may be described by the unitary matrix action
ˆhos3 belonging to the isotropy group of the |R > [6]. The coherence vector oscillates
along the equator of the Poincar´e sphere under the modulation having the components
~C = (< x′|σ1|x′ >, < x′|σ2|x′ >, < x′|σ3|x′ >) = (cos(2φ(Ωt)), sin(2φ(Ωt)), 0), where
σα are Pauli matrices. The next step is the dragging with the frequency ω of the
oscillating state |x′(t) >= ˆhos3|x > (in fact the coherence vector ~C) up to the “north
pole” corresponding to the state |R >. This may be achieved by the variation of
the azimuth of linear polarized state from θ
4 with help the dense
ﬂint appropriate length embedded into the sweeping magnetic ﬁeld. Further this
beam should pass the λ/4 plate. This process of variation of the ellipticity of the
polarization ellipse may be described by the unitary matrix ˆbos′
1 belonging to the
coset homogeneous group sub-manifold SU(2)/S[U(1) × U(1)] = CP (1) of the |R >
[6]. Without the modulation this dragging leads to the evolution of the initial state
along the geodesic of CP (1) and the trace of the coherent vector on the Poincar´e
sphere is the meridian between the equator and the pole. The modulation deforms
both the geodesic and the corresponding trace of the tip of the coherence vector
leaving on the Poincar´e sphere during such evolution as it is shown in the Fig.1.

The light beam passing through optically active media like YIG ﬁlm and the dense
ﬂint leads to the slow kinematics of the polarization ellipse shape and its orientation.
The fast dynamics of the electromagnetic potentials or ﬁelds corresponding to the
dynamical phase may be discarded by the transition to the local projective coordinates

where the ellipticity η and inclination (azimuth) Φ angle may be calculated through
the components of the coherence vector. This slow coherent dynamics of the relative
amplitudes and phases of the photons may be described by the dispersion law along
the optic path Oz.

the correct commutation relations and provide pure locally unitary reference frame
relative Fubini-Study metric. The local approach is close related to the works of
Scrotsky and Kusmitchev [14, 15] where systematically used local complex projective
coordinate (ξ(t) in their denotations). Furthermore, Scrotsky posed the important
question about the character of the cooperative interaction in the ensemble of two-
level systems described by the Landau-Lifshiz equation.

In order to clarify the interaction character one has two realizations of the Rie-

mannian anholonomy.

1. The Riemannian curvature will be associated with the Yang-Mills ﬁelds of the
new kind deﬁned on CP (N − 1). The unitary evolution being represented by the
local dynamical variables Φi

Here C γ
αβ are of the SU(N) group structure constants [8]. Now we can introduce the
follows expression for the curvature originated ﬁeld Fαβ = R(Dα, Dβ)X k ∂
∂πk + c.c.,
which is the analog of Yang-Mills ﬁelds of the gauge potential associated with the
intrinsic aﬃne CP (N −1) connection. To my mind the curvature of the coset manifold
CP (N − 1) = SU(N)/S[U(1) × U(N − 1)] paves the way to the understanding the
cooperative interaction in the ensemble of “pseudo-spins” arose under the breakdown
the dynamical group G = SU(N) up to isotropy group H = U(1) × U(N − 1). The
equation for this ﬁeld is not established up to now.

2. The second gauge potential realization is the truly parallel transport agrees
with the Fubini-Study metric. Now I will introduce the parallel transported Hermitian
dynamical variable T p obeys the follows equation

as follows: T 1(s) = (ξ(1 + tan2(ωt)) + iη(1 + tan2(ωt))). The scalar product
Gik∗T i(s)T k
∗(s) = ξ2 + η2 is the invariant of the parallel transport. Then the in-
stant result of the comparison of the omnipresent along the geodesic the constant
vector (initial conditions) T 1(0) = (ξ + iη) and result of its parallel transport along
the geodesic is as follows

δ = Gik∗T i(0)T k

The result of the comparison of the parallel vectors ﬁelds arose from the initial
vector T 1(0) = (ξ + iη) parallel transported along the “reference” geodesic γ(t) and
along the deformed geodesic f (t) during the modulation is very interesting: all vectors
parallel transported along diﬀerent paths looks like smoothly opening “umbrella” along
the geodesic. At the θ = π/2 the parallel transported dynamical variable along one of
the deformed geodesics f (t) are orthogonal (in the sense of the Fubini-Study metric)
to the “handle” of the “umbrella” - the parallel transported vector along the geodesic.
It means that in fact the result of the parallel transport is local: this is single-deﬁned
by the geodesic issued from the initial point and by the dynamical variable (tangent
vector).

The square of the cosine of the angle between the exact solution of the equa-
∗(f (t)) for the parallel transport along

tion T i(γ(t)) and the numerical solution Ξk
deformed geodesic is shown in the picture Fig.3.

Figure 3: The square of cosine of the observable angle between two parallel trans-
ported vectors along the geodesic γ(0, π/2) and deformed geodesic f (0, π/2). The
relationship between frequencies is as follows: Ω = 10π, ω = π.

Conjecture The solution of the parallel transport equation along the geodesic
γ(0, π/2) is orthogonal to any solution of the parallel transport equation along a path
f (0, π/2) at the θ = π/2.

Comments
1. If the foregoing conjecture is correct than we have the natural mechanism of

the decoherence in CP (1).

2. The covariant formulation of the quantum dynamics in the CP (N − 1) should
lead to the observable geometrodynamical eﬀects like discussed here path dependable
behavior of the local dynamical variables.
It may be veriﬁed by the measurement
of the path dependent phase shift of the modulation frequency. On the other hand
this approach may serves as a direct measurement of the sectional curvature of the
projective Hilbert state space.

3. Local dynamical variables in CP (1) gives a possibility to extract the Qubit

coordinates in the superposition state.

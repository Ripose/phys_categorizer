Abstract

This paper contains results obtained as solutions of the Uniﬁed Field Theory equations.
It yields space nonlinear oscillations, a quartet of gravitational forces, quintessence, and
replaces Einstein’s Cosmological Constant by an invariant parameter r0 which prevails over
the entire evolution of the Universe.

In the 1999 Coral Gables Conference I had reported on the latest observations, with
regard to the expansion of the universe with increasing acceleration which theoretically
was explained in terms of the existence of repulsive gravitational forces predicted in 1991
from the uniﬁed theory1 (see page 493 in this reference) and further that space itself was
subjected to some nonlinear oscillations with variable frequencies. These predictions of the
uniﬁed theory were published in the proceedings of the 1999 Coral Gables Conference2.
Contrary to the existing paradigm amongst most cosmologists and physicists, I strongly
agree with Einstein’s regret for his introduction of the cosmological constant into (though
for diﬀerent reasons) his general relativistic theory of gravitation. In the uniﬁed theory
the 16 component non-symmetric tensor ˆgµv = gµv + εq−1Φµv where ε = ±1, ±i contains
the invariant parameter q, where q2 is an energy density and is related to an intrinsic
fundamental length parameter r0 by the relation

0q2 = c4/2G.
r2

(1)

This relation was obtained3 in 1950 while a graduate student in Cambridge University
and it is the condition for the non-symmetric theory to reduce to general relativity in the
limit of ro = 0, the correspondence limit4. The parameter q has the dimensions of an
electric ﬁeld and therefore the ﬁeld tensor ˆgµv is dimensionless. The relation (1) can also
be regarded as an equation of state. The role of r0, which varies between zero and inﬁnity,
in this theory is as important as the role of ¯h in quantum theory. This is the missing link
in Einstein and Schr¨odinger versions5 of the non-symmetric theory. Both Einstein6 (see
the Appendix II page 146) and Schr¨odinger1 (see the letter to me in the Appendix of this
reference) have commented on the subject of constants in a physical theory.

The expansion of the universe is now linked up with the predicted existence of the
quartet of gravitational forces. This multiplicity of the gravitational forces can be seen by
studying the sign of the gravitational constant G in the equation of state (1). The four

possible substitutions in the relation (1) for the two invariant parameters r0 and q are

1 = [±r0, ±q], G

1 = [±ir0, ±q], G

−

2 = [±r0, ±iq], G+

2 = [±ir0, ±iq],

(2)

G+ = G (attractive gravity), and G− = −G (repulsive gravity). Thus, the quartet of
gravitational forces consists of two attractive G+

I would like, for the use of the ﬁeld equations of uniﬁed theory, to introduce an invariant
function f , which was already contained in the original ﬁeld equation, and a new variable
β by the relation

dr = f dβ.

In terms of the new variable β, the spherically symmetric ﬁeld equations can be written as

where

and where now S, ρ, and Φ can be regarded as functions of the new variable β. The
equation (7) is derivable from the three equations (4), (5), (6) which can be written as

implies nonlinear oscillations of the orbiton magnetic charge layers. Hence we see that the
structure of an orbiton, in view of the variable frequency ω, oscillates like a pendulum whose
length is changing. An orbiton, which conﬁnes all the monopoles, is formed as a result
of a condensation1 of inﬁnite number of magnetic charges or monopoles into alternating
and decreasing thickness of the layers of positive and negative charges (with zero sum).
At distances large compared to r0 the function exp( 1

deﬁned by

where e and g represent electric and magnetic charges, respectively. If we assume Φ is a
constant then there are no oscillations and we can calculate r0 in the form
0 = (2G/c4)N 2 | g | (e2 + g2)1/2,

0 = (ℓ4

and λ0 and ℓ0 are constants of integration.

The dynamics of space in the presence of matter is not simple. The existence of mag-
netic charge carrying quintessence with repulsive gravitational force versus ordinary matter
with attractive gravitational force are in a state of competition which drives the expansion
of the universe with increasing acceleration. The presence of the space oscillations in the
vicinity of matter do provide regularity to the expansion of the universe. The oscillations
are not conﬁned to a point but, as in the case of superstrings theory, they behave like a
patch where the oscillating system has, as in the general relativity, a Schwarzschild radius.
The size of a patch can be of the order of r0 and its mass can be deﬁned as

M = (c2/2G)r0,

(15)

where r0 is equal to the Schwarzschild radius of the mass M. If we treat a proton as a patch
then its Schwarzschild radius is of the order of 10−54cm. The largest oscillating patch is
the universe itself with its Schwarzschild radius being equal to its size r0 = 1028cm. In
this case i.e., r0 ∼ ∞ and the ﬁeld equations (4)-(7) would yield ﬂat space-time solutions
which would indicate the fact that universe is ﬂat.

In this paper I have thus shown that the fundamental parameter r0 diﬀers from Ein-
stein’s concept of cosmological constant in a fundamental way since in this case a single
parameter is part of the non-symmetric structure and prevails over the entire evolution of
the universe. Why did Einstein not consider the necessity and highly visible existence of
r0? Was he mostly inﬂuenced by the disappointment with his own cosmological constant?
Actually Einstein answers this question, presumably, based on my correspondence with
him during 1950-1952 on the subject matter of constants in the ﬁeld equations, in his
famous book6, page 146, “all such additional terms bring a heterogeneity into the system
of equations, and can be disregarded, provided that no strong physical argument is found
to support them”. I must point out that without r0 we can not even obtain the classical
laws of motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic ﬁeld. I obtained many addi-
tional results to refute entirely Einstein’s claim quoted above. The most striking fact can
be found in the deﬁnition of mass: elementary particles, the sun, the earth, a black hole,
neutron star etc. obtained as

M = (c2/2G)r0 = (1/2)(r0/rp)mp,

(16)

where rp and mp represent Planck length and Planck mass, respectively.

Finally, with regard to nonlinear oscillations, there is the possibility that space itself
consists of ﬂuctuating bubbles as often referred to as quantum foam or in this case we may
prefer a description like nonlinear foam.

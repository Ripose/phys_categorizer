Abstract

We ﬁnd a solution for exponential inﬂation in Brans-Dicke cosmology endowed with a cosmolog-

ical term, which includes time-varying shear and vorticity. We ﬁnd that the scalar ﬁeld and the

scale factor increase exponentialy while shear, vorticity, energy density, cosmic pressure and the

cosmological term decay exponentialy for beta < 0, where beta is deﬁned in the text.

SHEAR AND VORTICITY IN INFLATIONARY
BRANS-DICKE COSMOLOGY WITH
LAMBDA-TERM

Marcelo Samuel Berman

It appears that the existence of shear ( σ ), vorticity ( ̟ ) and cosmological ”constant”

( Λ ), have not been well discussed in the context of a scalar ﬁeld theory, say, compatible

with Brans-Dicke (1961) theory.

Not only for scalar-tensor theory, as such, but also for string researchers, the introduc-

tion of non-null shear, vorticity and lambda, for inﬂationary models, stand in the goals of

theorists.

Though initially masterminded in order to fulﬁll Machian ideas, as conceived by Einstein,

it has revealed much more fruitful for many reasons, including the possibility of extension

to a time-varying increasing coupling ”constant”, which would make gravity theory (read

”Scalar-Tensor”), indistinguishable from General Relativity, in matter-dominated epochs.

The origin of all scalar tensor theories rests, in the original Brans-Dicke (B.D.) theory.

Conventional B.D. theory is stated in the ”Jordan frame”, i.e., it conforms with the

original paper (Brans and Dicke, 1961). Another picture is called the ”Einstein’s frame”,

or non-conventional system of units; the latter, resembles as much as possible, with General

Relativity, but is unable to account for vacuum Physics, when Einstein’s tensor is null. The

reason is the omni - present scalar ﬁeld, which provides for non-vacuum state. The scalar

ﬁeld is a cause for gravity, so it can not be removed. Covariant divergence conservation

equation,

is not obeyed, as well as the usual general relativistic equations for geodesics, and

geodesic deviation.

It is generally accepted that scalar tensor cosmologies play a central rˆole in the present

view of the very early Universe (Faraoni, 2004). The cosmological ”constant” (Berman,

2007), which represents quintessence, is a time varying entity, whose origin remounts to

Quantum theory. The ﬁrst, and most important scalar tensor theory was devised by Brans

and Dicke(1961). Afterwards, Dicke(1962) presented a new version of the theory, where

2

the ﬁeld equations resembled Einstein’s equations, but time, length, and inverse mass, were

scaled by a factor φ−

2 where φ stands for the scalar ﬁeld: it is the Einstein’s frame units

framework. Then, the energy momentum tensor Tij

is augmented by a new term Λij , so

that:

Gij = −8πG (Tij + Λij)

,

where Gij

stands for Einstein’s tensor. The new energy tensor quantity, including a

Λgµν

term, is given by new modiﬁed energy density, with added Λ
κ

term, while cosmic

pressure is subtracted by the same

Λ
κ term; we have, then,

Λij = 2ω+3

(cid:3)

.

In the above, ω is the coupling constant. The other equation is:

(cid:3) log φ = 8πG

2ω+3 T

,

where (cid:3) is the generalized d’Alembertian, and T = T i
i

. It is useful to remember that

the energy tensor masses are also scaled by φ−

.

The complete set of ﬁeld equations, must be complemented by three more equations,

of which only two are independent, when taken along with (5),(6) and (7): one is the

dynamical ﬂuid equation; the other is the continuity one, as follow:

(8b)

All the above equations, are generalizations of those in the book by Raychaudhuri (1979),

which were written for Λ = 0 . We stress again, that the equations refer to a perfect ﬂuid.

When we combine the above equations, we would ﬁnd equation (8) below:

¨R
R = − 4πG
3 (cid:0)

ρ + 3p + 4ρλ − Λ

4πG (cid:1)

.

(8)

Relation (8) represents Raychaudhuri’s equation for a perfect ﬂuid. By the usual proce-

dure, we would ﬁnd the Raychaudhuri’s equation in the general case, involving shear (σij)

and vorticity (̟ij); the acceleration of the ﬂuid is null for the present case.

It suﬃces to make the following substitution in Raychaudhuri’s equation:

[−4πG (ρ + 3p + 4ρλ)] → [−4πG (ρ + 3p + 4ρλ) + 2 (̟2 − σ2)]

,

and then we ﬁnd:

3 ˙H + 3H 2 = 2 (̟2 − σ2) − 4πG (ρ + 3p + 4ρλ) + Λ

,

(9)

where Λ stands for a cosmological ”constant”. As we are mimicking Einstein’s ﬁeld

equations, Λ in (9) stands like it were a constant (see however, for instance, Berman,

2007). Notice that, when we impose that the ﬂuid is not accelerating, this means that the

quadri-velocity is tangent to the geodesics, i.e., the only interaction is gravitational. The

trick leading to equation (9), from equation (8), may not have been considered explicitly

elsewhere, like we do here.

Now, we remember that, if there were no other important reason to consider inﬂation,

we would still mention the fact that, with a Machian equation of state, as considered by

4

Berman (2006), we would have a graceful entrance into exponentially growing scalar-factor.

So, consider now exponential inﬂation, like we ﬁnd in Einstein’s theory:

For the time being, H is just a constant, deﬁned by H = ˙R

R . We shall see, when we go

back to conventional Brans-Dicke theory, that H is not the Hubble’s constant.

From (10), we ﬁnd H = H0 = constant.

A solution of Raychaudhuri’s equation (9), together with all other equations, would be

The ultimate justiﬁcation for this solution is that one ﬁnds a good solution in the conven-

tional units theory. It can be check easily that, when the perfect ﬂuid part of all equations

produced above, are fulﬁlled, then (9) gives the imperfect ﬂuid Raychaudhuri’s equation. In

other words, ρ and p

are the usual energy density and cosmic pressure terms.

We can not forget that we still have the conditions (11b) and (11c) to be obeyed by the

constants.

We now investigate the limit when

t −→ ∞ of the above formulae, having in mind

that, by checking that limit, we will know which ones increase or decrease with time; of

course, we can not stand with an inﬂationary period unless it takes only an extremely small

period of time. We shall suppose that β < 0 .

We ﬁnd:

As we can check, the scale factor and the scalar ﬁeld are time-increasing, while all other

elements of the model, namely, vorticity, shear, Hubble’s parameter, energy density, cosmic

pressure, and cosmological term, as described by the above relations, decay with time. This

being the case, shear and vorticity decaying, the tendency is that, after inﬂation, we retrieve

7

a nearly perfect ﬂuid:

inﬂation has the peculiarity of removing shear and vorticity from the

model. It has to be remarked, that pressure and energy density obey a perfect gas equation

of state. This is the outcome for the ”graceful” exit

from the inﬂationary phase, while we

adopt into consideration, for instance,

the section with the latter title (in italics), of the

book by Kolb and Turner (1990), to which we refer the reader.

New proton and neutron magic numbers in

It is now known that in neutron rich nuclei, old magic numbers disappear
and new ones appear. Single nucleon and double nucleon separation energies
are plotted here in all possible manner.Using this data it is shown here for
the ﬁrst time that nuclei with pair of proton number Z and neutron number
N ( Z,N ) : (6,12), (8,16), (10,20), (11,22) and (12,24) exhibit exceptional
stability or magicity. As such these magic numbers appear in pairs. This
correlation is shown here to be indicative of predominance of tritons in the
ground state of these neutron rich nuclei. Thus 30
10Ne20 has the structure of
10 3
1H2 in the ground state. This conﬁrms the prediction of the author that
triton clustering in neutron rich nuclei as a new phenomenon.

Abstract

1

The study of neutron rich nuclei with the help of RI beams has been
proving to be full of surprizes. First the halo structure cropped up and now
the realization that in the neutron rich nuclei the standard magic numbers
may disappear and new ones may arise in an unanticipated manner [1,2,3,4].
In this letter the focus is the study of these new magicities in neutron rich
nuclei. Single nucleon and double nucleon separation energies are analyzed
in the standard manner and also in a slightly diﬀerent manner as discussed
below. Evidence for new magic numbers will be discussed.
Interestingly
proton and neutron numbers are found to be uniquely and consistently cor-
related in these new magiciies. It shall be pointed out that the only possible
way to understand this correlation is through the eﬀect of triton clustering
in neutron rich nuclei. It will be emphasized that triton clustering - a new
eﬀect predicted by the author [5], is for real.

To discuss magicity one normally plots separation energies S1n and S2n as
a function of neutron number N for a particular proton number Z or plot S1p
and S2p as a function of Z for a particular N. It is very common to plot S2n
and look for kinks as evidence for magicity [3,4]. In addition to plotting the
separation energies in the above standard manner, we plot the separation
energies a little diﬀerently. We plot S1n and S2n as a function of Z for a
particular N. The same with S1p and S2p as a function of N for a particular
Z. We shall ﬁnd here that these new plots give useful and distinguishable
information regarding stabilty and magicity in these light nuclei.

We plot separation energies for neutron number N and for proton number
Z ﬁxed separately at 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 22 and 24. For example Fig
1 and Fig 2 are respectively plots of S1n and S2n for ﬁxed N= 4, 6, 8, 10, 11,
12, 16, 20, 22 and 24 plotted as a function of Z. Figs 3 and 4 are respectively
plots of S1n and S2n for ﬁxed Z= 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 22 and 24 as
a function of N. Figs 5 and 6 plot S1p and S2p respectively for N ﬁxed at
the above set as a function of Z and Figs. 7 and 8 are S1p and S2p plotted
respectively for Z ﬁxed at the above set for diﬀerent N. So what we have
plotted are N ﬁxed ( isotones ) for S1n, S2n, S1p and S2p all as functions of Z
and also for Z ﬁxed ( isotopes ) S1n, S2n, S1p and S2p all as functions of Z.
In every case we notice the extra stabilty for all the cases wherein N=Z.
This extra stability for even-even N=Z nuclei is attributed to the signiﬁcance
of α clusters. So for 20
10Ne10 ground state it is the 5-α conﬁguration which is
believed to be important and thereby providing extra stabilty.

The reader’s attention is drawn to the extra-ordinary stabilty manifested

2

by the plotted data for the proton and neutron pairs (Z,N): (6,12), (8,16),
(10,20), (11,22) and (12,24). The stabilty at these pair of numbers is some-
times as prominent as that at the N=Z pair. In fact the Z,N pair (10,20)
stands out as the best example of this. Hence it is clear that the separation
energy data very clearly shows that there are new magicities present in the
neutron rich sector for the pair (Z,N) where N=2Z.

What is the signiﬁcance of this extraordianry stabilty or magicity for
the nuclei 3Z
A2Z? We already know that for the even-even Z=N cases it is
Z
the signiﬁcance of α clustering for the ground state of these nuclei which
explains this extra stabilty. Quite clearly the only way we can explain the
extra magicity for these N=2Z nuclei is by invoking the signiﬁcance of triton
clustering in the ground state of these netron rich nuclei. Thus 30
10Ne20 has
signiﬁcant mixture of the conﬁguration 10 3
It is
these tritonic clusters which give the extra stabilty to these nuclei thereby
provoding us whith these unique new sets of magic numbers.

1H2 in the ground state.

This tenedency of triton clustering in neutron rich nuclei was already
predicted by the author a few years ago [5]. The present paper shows that
there is indeed strong empirical evidence in support of the author’s predicion
[5]. If fact this may be treated as ”smoking gun” kind of evidence in support
of signiﬁcane of triton clusters in the ground state of 3Z
Z

A2Z nuclei.

One may ask to why the stabilty for a particular set is not manifesting
itself in all the plots. One reason is that due to the limitation of the span
of individual isotones and individual isotopes over the corresponding (Z,N)
sets may not be rich enough. So it seems that neither the very low mass
nor the high mass nuclei would provide discriminatory evidence in this re-
gard. Intermediate mass nuclei like 30
10Ne20 tend to show up this eﬀect most
prominently for the isotonic data. However there may be other pairs like
(4,8) where though somewhat weaker there does appear to be manifestation
of possible magic pairs. In this regard signiﬁcance of the presence of diﬀerent
clusters like α and/or tritons for the ground state of a particular nucleus and
also whether it is proton/protons or neutron/neutrons being pulled out will
manifest itself in the structure of the data. This point is at present under
investigation by the author.

Once the triton clustering aspect of nucleus 3Z
Z

A2Z is understood then
extra stabilities in the intermediate cases like N=20 stabilty in S2n data for
Z=16 can be understood as tendency of triton clustering to bring it about.
One should be able to understand theses extra stabilities as mixing in the

3

2He1

shell model conﬁguration of α - clustering and t-clustering conﬁgurations.
Similarly the helion (”h”) 3
conﬁguration may manifest itself especially
in odd-odd N=Z nuclei. One alreday knows that h-t conﬁguration mixes
considerably with α-n-p conﬁguration to give a good understanding of the
ground state of 6
3Li3 . Similar must be the case for the Z=12 stabilty of
N=22 case of S2n where all - α-, t- and h- clustering may all be playing a
role. Such cases have to be sorted and worked out in the future. Also there
would be other explicit manifestations of triton clustering in data and which
should be looked for. Here the purpose has been to bring out a few clear cut
cases of the same so that there can be no doubt as to the correctness of the
idea [5].

In short, here the aim is to understand as to which new magic numbers are
arising in the neutron rich nuclei. With this aim single nucleon and double

shown here that nuclei with pair of proton number Z and neutron number
N (Z,N) : (6,12), (8,16), (10,20), (11,22) and (12,24) ( and possibly (4,8) )
exhibit exceptional stability or magicity. This correlation is shown to prove
the signiﬁcance of tritons in the ground state of these neutron rich nuclei.
Thus 30
1H2 in the ground state. This conﬁrms
the prediction of the author on the tendency of triton clustering in neutron
rich nuclei [5]. Whole new questions shall arise from this new empirical fact.

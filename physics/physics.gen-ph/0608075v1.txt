A thought experiment is proposed that shows an unex-
pected behavior according to classical electromagnetism. Ba-
sically, using Maxwell equations it is shown that energy could
be generated spontaneously in a particularly designed pas-
sive circuit. Although useful in its ”gedanken” form, with
appropriate materials and design, the experiment could be
performed and the implications veriﬁed.

The possibly simplest generalization of Maxwell equations,
already known in the literature, solves the paradox of energy
generation, although new features appear, such as the cancel-
lation of the magnetic ﬁeld inside a charging-discharging ca-
pacitor and the existence of longitudinal electric waves. The
conclusion is then paradoxical but the implications are far
reaching.

I. INTRODUCTION

Maxwell equations provide an extremely satisfactory
and complete model of all known classical electromag-
netic phenomena and, apparently, no anomalous eﬀect
predicted by them has been reported in the literature.
The purpose of the present work is to show that such
an eﬀect can be expected in the case of a particular,
passive circuit. The basic idea is simple to appreciate.
Consider two similar circuits consisting each in a series
solenoid-capacitor. The solenoid is a toroidal one, and
the capacitor consists in two annular disks facing each
other, with a linear dielectric in between (the need for
the dielectric is analyzed below). The capacitor of each
of the circuits lies inside the solenoid of the other (the
solenoid is wound around the capacitor, see Fig. 1). Note
that due to the solenoids being closed the mutual induc-
tance between circuits can be ideally zero. In this way,
at the level of a quasi-stationary approximation, one ex-
pects independent oscillatory behavior of each circuit, for
instance, starting with zero currents and charged capac-
itors. When the system of Maxwell equations is taken
into account at the level of approximation considered,
one sees that the time dependent toroidal magnetic ﬁeld
generated in the charging-discharging capacitor induces
an electromotive force in the solenoid. This can be ex-
pressed as an eﬀective mutual inductance between cir-
cuits. At variance with a truly inductive coupling, the
sign of the eﬀective mutual inductance coeﬃcient can

be made diﬀerent for each circuit by proper connection.
The resulting coupled equations for the capacitor charges
and circuit currents have then solutions showing tran-
sient growth with time for almost every initial condition.
This is the basic idea which is analyzed with more de-
tail below. The main assumptions in a ﬁrst approach are
ideally non resistive conductors and losseless media, in
which case the eﬀect is always present. Later we ana-
lyze the eﬀect on more realistic elements to show that
the anomaly is expected also in this case for a particu-
lar range of parameters. Finally, a possible solution is
presented based on an extension of Maxwell equations to
include an scalar ﬁeld.

II. ANALYSIS

In Fig. 1a both circuits are shown, with the capac-
itors outside the solenoids, and without their internal
dielectric for clarity. Note that in circuit 2 the upper
plate of the capacitor is connected to the cable leaving
the solenoid from below, which is the only diﬀerence be-
tween both circuits (both solenoids are equally built, so
as the capacitors). In Fig. 1b an inside view of a solenoid
with the internal capacitor is shown, denoting also the
linear material of relative permittivity and permeabil-
ity εrel and µrel, respectively. Although the wires in
the solenoids are drawn well separated for clarity, the N
turns in each solenoid are considered closely packed so
that ideally non magnetic ﬁeld is generated outside the
solenoids.

One expects in this system an oscillation of frequency
ν, which can in principle be made suﬃciently small for
large enough values of εrel and µrel that control the ca-
pacitance and inductance of the system. In the following
we analyze the quasi-stationary behavior of the circuit
valid at small ν. More precisely the small parameter is
λ
νls/c, where c is the speed of light in the mate-
rial medium and ls a characteristic length of the system.
We will require further that the currents i1,2 are uniform
along the whole cable (connecting plus solenoid) of the
corresponding circuit, which requires λ0
1,
where lc is the length of the cable and c0 the speed of
light in vacuum.

the magnetic ﬁeld H is generated by the free current den-
sity j and the time variation of the displacement vector
ﬁeld D. The contributions to j in each circuit are com-
posed of the main current in the solenoid and connecting
cables, which gives rise to the currents i1,2, and the con-
tributions, denoted as secondary, due to currents in the
charging-discharging capacitor plates together with the
induced currents (Foucault currents) in the solenoid and
plates, to ensure zero electric and magnetic ﬁelds inside
these conductors, assumed of negligible resistivity (in the
sense that the penetration length is much smaller than
the conductors thickness).

with ρ the free charge density distributed in the capac-
itor plates and induced in the solenoid internal surface,
using also the linearity of the problem, one can see that
the contributions to H at order λ coming from the time
variation of D and the secondary currents scale as, for in-
stance, the instantaneous total charge in the plate of the
capacitor, indicated in Fig. 1. In eﬀect, by the linearity
of the system one can split the problem of calculating the
magnetic ﬁeld inside the solenoid into that of the solenoid
with its main current containing an uncharged capaci-
tor, and that of a charging-discharging capacitor inside a
conducting toroid without its main current. In the ﬁrst
problem, as proved simply using the azimuthal symmetry
valid in this case, the magnetic ﬁeld outside the capacitor
plates is just the one inside an empty solenoid, as the Fou-
cault currents induced in the capacitor plates only cancel
the magnetic ﬁeld inside these conductors, generating no
ﬁeld outside them. Besides, at order λ (quasi-stationary
approximation) no free surface charge density is induced
in a conductor by the alternating magnetic ﬁeld [1], so
that no charge appears in the capacitor plates and no
conservative part of D is generated. The eﬀect of the D
ﬁeld can then be neglected for this problem as, from Eq.
(2) and Faraday law (for the electric ﬁeld E and magnetic
induction B)

E =

E (and consequently D) scales as the characteristic fre-
quency of oscillation ν, so that its contribution to H
scales as ν2, and can be neglected at order λ (more pre-
λ2
cisely, one has

j
).
|
|
In a similar manner, in the second problem (charging-
discharging capacitor and no main current in the
solenoid) the magnetic ﬁeld scales, according to Eqs. (1)
and (3), as the characteristic frequency of oscillation ν,
and so, from Eq. (4), the curl of E (and consequently
of D) scales as ν2 (one has
D
). At

the order λ considered this problem is then well approx-
imated by a quasi-electrostatic one in which D scales as
the instantaneous charge distribution, quantiﬁed, for in-
stance, by the charge in one plate of the capacitor. As
the currents in the capacitor plates and those induced in
the solenoid also scale in the same way, Amp`ere equation
(1) indicates that the corresponding contribution to H
scales as dQ2,1/dt for each circuit.

One can thus write for the azimuthal component of the
magnetic ﬁeld at any (r, ϕ, z) inside the solenoid of either
circuit,

depends only on the geometry and material characteris-
tics, but not on the charge of the capacitor (an approxi-
mate expression of F will be considered later).

which is made closed along a path going form one plate
of the capacitor to the other (suﬃciently close to the
cable connecting the plates so as to concatenate no mag-
netic ﬂux. Alternatively, the path could be closed across
the cables connecting the capacitor plates just before en-
tering the solenoid. The result is the same because the
electric ﬁeld inside the conductors is zero). The direction
of circulation assumed is that of the currents shown in
Fig 1, and the connecting cables are close together. In
these conditions there is magnetic ﬂux across C1,2 only
inside the solenoids, which can be evaluated as

III. PARAMETER ESTIMATION

We now estimate the diﬀerent parameters in the cir-
cuit. This can be done easily in the case of azimuthal
symmetry, which requires that the currents in the capac-
itor plates have this symmetry. This can be achieved
quite closely by making each capacitor plate in a given
circuit as a tight spiral of the same cable connecting to
the solenoid in that circuit. The non-symmetrical contri-
bution to the magnetic ﬁeld from the current in the short
vertical extension of wire connecting the plates can be
evaluated explicitly using Biot-Savart expression, result-
20% of that generated by the currents
ing in about 10
−
in the capacitor plates (for d / b
a), so that it can be
neglected in the estimations (besides, this small contri-
bution adds up constructively to the one considered).

−

What is then needed is the contribution to Hϕ1,2 gen-
erated by the charging-discharging capacitor inside the
conducting surface of the solenoid without its main cur-
rent.

As mentioned above, the evaluation of D for this case
can be made as for an electrostatic problem correspond-
ing to the instantaneous charge distribution in the con-
ductors. This is a simple standard problem if end ef-
fects are neglected, assuming also homogeneous surface
charge densities in the inner and outer surfaces of the
capacitor plates and in the inner surface of the solenoid.
These approximations were veriﬁed solving numerically
the non-approximated problem with the commercial soft-
ware QuickField [2], which shows that the approximation
is very good for d and d0 smaller than b
a, and gets bet-
ter the larger the value of εrel.

In the evaluations to follow the distance to the solenoid

not to introduce new symbols.

IV. INCLUSION OF LOSSES

So far the conductors and media were considered los-
seless. If the resistivity of the conductors is included the
electric ﬁeld circulation in Eq. (6) along the cables con-
tributes a term Ri1,2 for the corresponding circuit, with
R the resistance of the whole cable length lc. The circuit

Additional losses occur due to the Foucault currents
induced in the capacitor plates to ensure zero magnetic
ﬁeld inside them as the solenoid current oscillates (the
resistivity is considered ﬁnite but small so that the pen-
etration length of electric and magnetic ﬁelds is small
compared to the conductors thickness). As these surface
currents are of the same order as those in the solenoid
(they have similar penetration length, extend over sur-
faces of similar extension, and generate magnetic ﬁelds
of the same order), the total power loss in each capacitor
plate is similar to that in the solenoid, of average R i2
0/2,
where i0 is the amplitude of the oscillating current.

Finally, radiation losses are in general of order λ2. In
the conditions considered, λ
1, the radiation is mainly
dipolar [3] and can be estimated to be a very negligible
fraction of the average power in the circuit.

≪

In this way, the eﬀect is easily prevented if the re-
sistance in the cables is high or the material too lossy.
However, if granular materials with suﬃciently high val-
ues of ε′ and µ′, and low values of σ, ε′′, and µ′′ can be
synthesized, which is possible in principle [4], and good
conductors employed, the thought experiment could be
actually performed and the existence or not of the eﬀect
veriﬁed. Note that the evaluation of R must include the
skin eﬀect of the oscillating currents, dependent on ω, so
that careful design is required for the eﬀect (if existent)
to show up when real elements are used.

We are thus faced with the paradoxical result that
a particularly simple, isolated, passive device could in-
crease its electromagnetic energy with time. This non-
physical behavior cannot be explained, for instance, in
terms of advanced electromagnetic waves (even if the ex-
istence of this kind of waves is accepted), as radiation ef-
fects are of higher order, in the small parameter λ, than
the predicted eﬀect.

Notably, a possible resolution could require an exten-
sion of Maxwell equations. Let us analyze with some
detail that proposed by Ohmura ﬁfty years ago [5] based
on the spinor formalism of classical ﬁelds. In particular,
we consider the simplest version of Ohmura equations,
without magnetic monopole sources, and with solenoidal
magnetic induction B (even in the absence of magnetic
B can be non-zero by the presence of
monopoles,
a pseudo-scalar function h in the most general Ohmura
equations). These equations, formulated in vacuum, re-
duce to

by the conservation of charge, which is no longer au-
tomatically satisﬁed, but must be imposed as an addi-
tional law. The scalar ﬁeld e thus satisﬁes a sourceless
wave equation and propagates with the speed of light in
vacuum, not inﬂuenced by the presence of charges and
currents. This means, in particular, that in boundless
space with no incoming “scalar radiation” no e ﬁeld ex-
ists and Maxwell equations have their usual form. This
is a particularly attractive feature, as the usual electro-
magnetism for given distributions of charge and currents
in empty space is recovered.

Due to the coupling of the e ﬁeld with the electromag-
netic ﬁeld, one can expect this scalar ﬁeld to be generated
in the presence of material media that impose conditions
on the electromagnetic ﬁeld, namely good conductors in-
side which no electric or varying magnetic ﬁeld exist. In-
side such a conductor one has, from Eq. (12d),

e =

µ0j,

which acts as a “boundary condition” for the wave equa-
tion (13).

In order to apply these extended equations in a
medium one should generalize Eqs. (12). For this con-
sider that the propagation of the e ﬁeld is not aﬀected
by the charges or currents present, so one expects no
change in its propagation velocity in a material medium
due to polarization charges and currents or magnetiza-
tion currents, in which case e satisﬁes the same equation
as in vacuum. This is ensured if the non-homogeneous

can explain the non-appearance of the anomalous eﬀect.
For this we use Eqs. (15) to evaluate the contribution
H ′
ϕ to the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the charging-
discharging capacitor, for the case of azimuthal symme-
try, where H ′
ϕ can be evaluated more easily.
In this way, considering the volume shown in Fig. 2,
with lower surface S1 and upper surface S2, one can write
(15b) across S1, using only the

From this equation, taking the time derivative of Eq.
(15a), we see that the contribution to H ′
ϕ, through
∂Dz/∂t, from the term ε0∂e/∂t is of order λ2, so that it
can be neglected in the quasi-stationary approximation
considered. In this way, to the eﬀect of the evaluation of
H ′
ϕ, D can be calculated with the original Gauss equa-
tion (2). At the same level of approximation the equation
2e = 0, with the condition (14)
(13) for e reduces to
2e = 0 inside V and
inside the conductor. Integrating

VI. CONCLUSIONS

A relatively simple device, a passive circuit, was hy-
pothesized to present a strange behavior according to
the known laws of electromagnetism. The analysis of the
processes involved was made at the level of the quasi-
stationary approximation which is valid for a realistic
range of parameters of the device. The hypothetical in-
crease of energy in this passive circuit does not contra-
dict in principle the conservation of energy, but implies
a net Poynting ﬂux entering the circuit. How this in-
coming ﬂow is eﬀected is the real non-physical aspect of
the phenomenon, as not even advanced electromagnetic
waves (allowed in principle by Maxwell equations) can be
likely responsible due to the non-radiative nature of the
eﬀect. Although the inclusion of losses prevents the phe-
nomenon in most cases, a careful design and use of proper
materials can lead to a realizable device that could allow
the eﬀect to be tested experimentally.

If the analysis presented is correct, one is faced with
a paradoxical situation whatever the result of the exper-
iment. The unlikeness of a positive veriﬁcation of the

6

eﬀect favors a reconsideration of the equations of electro-
magnetism. In this respect, possibly the simplest exten-
sion of Maxwell equations, a reduced version of Ohmura
equations, is shown to account for the non-existence of
the eﬀect. Of course, the extension of Maxwell equa-
tions cannot be made without much experimentation and
research. The point of this work is to present a rea-
son for this research to be undertaken.
In particular,
the extended equations analyzed predict new eﬀects, as
the cancellation of the magnetic ﬁeld inside a charging-
discharging capacitor, which could be tested experimen-
tally. Another remarkable prediction is the existence of
longitudinal electric waves as, according to Eq. (12a),
the divergence of E in vacuum is not necessarily zero if a
time-varying e ﬁeld is present (see [6] for an interesting
interpretation of the scalar ﬁeld, and the derivation of
this prediction and others).

It says in the report1 by Wang et al. that a negative group velocity
u = −c/310 is obtained and that a pulse advancement shift 62-ns is mea-
sured. The authors claim that the negative group velocity is associated
with superluminal light propagation and that the pulse advancement
is not at odds with causality or special relativity. However, it is shown
here that their conclusions above are not true. Furthermore, I give
some suggestion concerning a re-deﬁnition of group-velocity and a new
explanation in special relativity of causality.

The velocity of u = −(c/310)ˆk0 is subluminal but not superluminal
(the term “superluminal” is usually understood as such a light propagation with
phase, group, and energy velocities all exceeding the vacuum speed of light2). It
is well-known that the 4-dimensional interval for a signal in special relativity is
given by

ds2 = c2dt2 −(cid:16)dx2 + dy2 + dz2(cid:17) = dt2(cid:16)c2 − u2(cid:17) ,

as seen in the inertial frame K, where

u2 = u · u =  dx

with u being the velocity of the signal. According to special relativity, ds2 is an
invariant under Lorentz transformations, i.e. ds2 = ds′2. This means

dt′2(cid:16)c2 − u′2(cid:17) = dt2(cid:16)c2 − u2(cid:17) ,

where the quantities with a prime stand for the ones as seen in other inertial
frame K ′. This shows that both u2 and u′2 are all bigger, or all less, than c2.
Explicitly, |u| < c leads to |u′| < c. Similarly, |u| > c leads to |u′| > c. For the
case in the report by Wang et al., the velocity is found to be (in terms of vector
symbol) u = −(c/310)ˆk0 with ˆk0 being the unit vector of the incident direction
(see below) and hence |u| < c as seen in the laboratory frame. So that we have
|u′| < c, i.e. the velocity of the pulse would also be smaller than the vacuum
speed of light c, as seen in any of other inertial frames. Therefore, the negative
velocity obtained by Wang et al. is simply subluminal but not superluminal.

New suggestion concerning re-deﬁnition of negative velocity. Now
I want to give a new explanation of the so-called “negative” group velocity. By
deﬁnition the group velocity of a light pulse propagating in a dispersive linear
medium is given by3

u =

=

∂ω
∂k

c

n + ν dn
dν

ˆk,

(4)

where ˆk ≡ k/|k| is the unit vector of the direction of phase velocity (or wave
vector), k is wave vector, ν = ω/2π is frequency, and n = n(ν) is the optical
refractive index of the medium.

For a normal medium we have dn/dν > 0 and so that |u| < c. But for
anomalous dispersive linear media in where dn/dν < 0 , one arrives at the fol-
lowing two situations: (i) For 1 > n(ν) + νdn/dν ≥ 0, we have |u| > c; (ii) For
n(ν) + νdn/dν < 0, one gets

u = −

c

|n + ν dn
dν |

ˆk.

In case of a light pulse propagating vertically towards a surface of dispersive
medium from vacuum, the incident direction ˆk0 is usually deﬁned as to be pos-
itive. The wave vector (or phase velocity) of the pulse in the medium is usually
assumed to have a positive direction (i.e. ˆk = ˆk0) while the group velocity u then
has a negative direction4. If u represents the velocity of an actual information,
then the deﬁnition of negative group-velocity must give violation of causality.
Thus it is needed to modify the usual deﬁnition of phase and group velocities.

Here it must be emphasized that the negative sign “−” in Eq. (5) simply
indicates the directions of the group-velocity u and wave-vector k are opposite
each other, but not say which one should be negative. In fact there is no reason to
identify the direction of k in the medium with the incident one ˆk0. Contrarily, it
should be more reasonable to suppose the group-velocity u has the same direction
to that of the incident light signal, while the wave-vector k ( and hence phase
velocity) then has a negative direction, i.e., ˆk = −ˆk0. By use of the new deﬁnition,
we never meet any problem concerning violation of causality in case where the
group-velocity u does represent a velocity of an actual information.

Now come back to the case of u = −c/310 in terms of the symbol by Wang
et al.. Note that the negative velocity is not directly measured but calculated
by Wang et al.
from their measured refraction index by use of the deﬁnition:
u = c/ng with ng ≡ n(ν) + νdn(ν)/dν. In other words, the negative sign “−”
for ng < 0 is just deﬁned by them. Contrarily, according to the present new
deﬁnition, the group-velocity calculated from their measured refraction index
should be positive, and less than c.

The observed 62-ns advancement shift must be violation of causality.
Another result in the report1 by Wang et al. is the 62-ns advancement shift (see
Fig. 4 of Ref. 1). They claim that it is not at odds with causality. They argue
that it is a result of the wave nature of light and that no actual information,
or signal, is trasmitted1,5. However it must be pointed out that the authors

2

make confusion of the direct observation with theoretical prediction. At ﬁrst
it is emphasized that the 62-ns shift is a directly measured datum but not a
theoretical prediction. Secondly it is needed to clear whether the observed 62-
ns shift is an actual information. If not, one must face the question: Can you
measure a non-actual information in a laboratory? In fact, it is not possible for
any experimental device to record a non-actual signal. In other words, what a
device records is certainly an actual information. So that the curves A and B in
Fig. 4 in the report1 are just the records of actual information. The curves A
and B show that the actual signal B is advanced for 62-ns in time compared to
the the actual signal A. If A were the source of B, then the 62-ns advancement
would certainly be violation of causality. This conclusion is independent of any
theoretical prediction concerning phase, group, or other kind of velocity. Owing
to any actual signal should not violate causality, then the curve B could be
connected causally not with the curve A but only with a measurement error. The
3.7-µs full-width at half-maximum of the probe pulse means the pulse spatial
extension of more than 1-km much larger than the 6-cm length of the atomic
cell. On the other hand, the curve B is only translated in time but almost not
changed in shape compared to the curve A. So that possible sources of the 62-ns
translation would be a systematic error, or a pulse-reshaping phenomenon such as
the ampliﬁcation of the pulsefront and reduction of its tail. In order to determine
ﬁnally the source of the advancement shift, it is needed to perform further similar
measurements in diﬀerent experiment conditions, such as diﬀerent probe pulses,
diﬀerent cell lengths, and so on.

New suggestion for explanation of causality in special relativity. For
an anomalous dispersive medium with 1 > n(ν) + νdn/dν ≥ 0, group-velocity
is superluminal (i.e. u > c) in laboratory frame in which the medium is at rest.
Eq. (3) gives that the group-velocity in any of inertial frames is still superluminal
(i.e. u′ > c). Let t1 and t2 be the instants at which the light signal arrives at
points 1 and 2, respectively, in the medium. Due to the fact of △t = t2 − t1 > 0,
no causality would be violated in the laboratory frame. But by making use of
Lorentz transformations, one always ﬁnd such an inertial frame, e.g. the frame K ′,
in which we have △t′ = t′
1 < 0. This is just the so-called violation of causality
as seen within K ′. However it must be addressed that △t′ and △t are coordinate
time intervals but not proper ones. It is well-known that a coordinate time interval
is related to the deﬁnition of simultaneity and thus is not directly observable6. In
special relativity, therefore, all of physical observations must be used to compare
with such quantities which are invariant under Lorentz transformations, while
the only exception is just the explanation of causality above. Here I suggest to
explain causality by means of proper time interval in stead of coordinate one. To
do it, let the signal come back to the point 1 after it reaches the point 2. In this
case we have △τ = t3 − t1 > 0 where t3 is the instant at which the signal returns
to the point 1. Due to t1 and t3 are readings of the same standard clock at rest
at the point 1, so that △τ is just a proper time interval to be positive in all of
inertial frames. Using the new deﬁnition one could arrive at the conclusion: The
superluminal light propagation (i.e. u > c) is not at odds with both causality

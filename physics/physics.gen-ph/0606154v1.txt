Spectral Emission of Moving Atom
Exhibits always a Redshift∗

Abstract

A renewed analysis of the H.E. Ives and G.R. Stilwell’s experiment on moving
hydrogen canal rays (J. Opt. Soc. Am., 1938, v.28, 215) concludes that the
spectral emission of a moving atom exhibits always a redshift which informs not
the direction of the atom’s motion. The conclusion is also evident from a simple
energy relation: atomic spectral radiation is emitted as an orbiting electron
consumes a portion of its internal energy on transiting to a lower-energy state
which however has in a moving atom an additional energy gain; this results in a
redshift in the emission frequency. Based on auxiliary experimental information
and a scheme for de Broglie particle formation, we give a vigorous elucidation of
the mechanism for deceleration radiation of atomic electron; the corresponding
prediction of the redshift is in complete agreement with the Ives and Stilwell’s
experimental formula.

1 Introduction

Charged de Broglie particles such as the electron and the proton can be deceler-
ated by emitting electromagnetic radiation. This occurs in all diﬀerent kinds of pro-
cesses, including atomic spectral emission produced in laboratory[1, 2] and celestial
processes[3], and charged particle synchrotron radiation [4, 5]. The electromagnetic
radiation emission from sources of this type is in common converted from a portion
of the internal energy or the mass of a de Broglie particle involved, which often in-
volves a ﬁnal state in motion, hence moving source. The associated source-motion
eﬀect has, except for admitting a relativistic eﬀect connected to high sour-ce velocity,
thus far been taken as no diﬀerent from the ordinary Doppler eﬀect that consists in
a red- or blue- shift depending on the source is moving away or toward the observer.
The ordinary Doppler eﬀects are directly observable with moving sources of a ”con-
ventional type”, like an external-ﬁeld-driven oscillating electron, an automobile horn,

and others, that are externally driven into oscillation which does not add directly to
the mass of the source. In this paper we ﬁrst (Sec. 2) examine the property, promi-
nently an invariable redshift, of moving atom radiation as informed by the hydrogen
canal ray experiment of Ives and Stilwell’s [1] performed at the Bell Labs in 1938 for
a thorougher investigation of the associated anomalous Doppler eﬀect then known.
Combining with auxiliary experimental information and a scheme for de Broglie parti-
cle formation[6], we then elucidate (Secs. 3-5) the mechanism for spectral emission of
moving atom, or in essence the underlying (relative) deceleration radiation of moving
de Broglie electron, and predict Ives and Stilwell’s experimental formula for redshift.

2 Indication by Ives-Stilwell’s experiment on

fast moving hydrogen atoms

In their experiment on fast moving hydrogen canal ray spectral emission[1], Ives and
Stilwell let positively charged hydrogen ions H+
i of mass MHi and charge qi (i = 2, 3)
be accelerated into a canal ray of high velocity, v, across accurately controlled electric
potential V correlated with v through the work-energy relation qV = 1

m/s as from (1). By neutralization and dissociation the ions are at exit converted to
excited atoms that are unstable and will transit to ground state by emitting Balmer
spectral lines. The wavelength, λr, of the emitted Hβ line is then measured using
diﬀraction grating (Figure 1a) as a function of V . For a ﬁnite v, the spectral line
produces a ﬁrst-diﬀraction peak at P (v), at distance y(v) = P O from the center
O; for a hydrogen at rest, v = 0, the line has a wavelength λr0 = 4861 angst. and
produces a ﬁrst peak at P0, y0 = P0O. These have the geometric relations: λr = λr0

The wavelength of spectral line emitted from an atom in motion is always
longer, or red-shifted, than from one at rest, irrespective if the atom is moving
away or toward the observer; the faster the atom moves, the longer wavelength
its spectral line is shifted to.

This apparently contrasts with the conventional Doppler eﬀect where wavelengths
will be λr = λr0(1
v/c) and λr = λr0(1 + v/c) and show a blue or red shift according
to if the source is moving toward or away from the observer.

3 Emission frequency of a moving atom

If a H atom is at rest in the vacuum, its electron, of charge
e in circular motion
at velocity un+1 about the atomic nucleus in an excited n + 1th orbit, has from
quantum-mechanical solution (and also solution based on the uniﬁcation scheme [6])
2], n = 1, 2, . . ., where me0 = γ0Me,
an eigen energy εu.n+1 =
106 m/s) being high, Me the electron rest mass,
γ0 = 1/[1
and aB0 Bohr’s radius (should already contain 1/γ0, see below). If now the electron
transits to an unoccupied nth orbit, the atom lowers its energy to εu.n and emits an
electromagnetic wave of frequency

accordingly λr0 = c/νr0 and kr0 = 2π/λr0 = 2πνr0/c.

If now the atom is moving at a velocity v in +x-direction, (v/c)2 >> 0, then in
the motion direction, its orbital radius is Lorentz contracted to aB = aB0/γ, and its
mass augmented according to Einstein to me = γme0 = γγ0Me (see also the classical-
(v/c)2. With aB and me for aB0 and

R

We now inspect how an electron transits, from an initial n + 1th to ﬁnal nth orbit
in an atom moving in general, here at velocity v in +x-direction. To the initial-state
electron, with a velocity un+1 if v = 0, the ﬁnite v of the traveling atom will at each
point on the orbit project a component v cos θ onto un+1(θ), with θ in (0, 2π); the
2π
average is ¯un+1 =
θ=0[un+1 + v cos θ]dθ = un+1. That is, ¯un+1 and any its derivative
dynamic quantities of the stationary-state orbiting electron are not aﬀected by v
except through the second order factor γ(v). The situation however diﬀers during
the n + 1

n transition which distinct features may be induced as follows:
(i) The transition ought realistically be a mechanical process in which, in each
sampling, the electron comes oﬀ orbit n + 1 at a single deﬁnite location, e.g. A in
Figure 2a. That where A is located on the orbit in any sampling, is a statistic event.
(ii) The spectral radiation is a single monochromatic electromagnetic wave emitted
in forward direction of the orbiting electron at the point (A) it comes oﬀ orbit n +
1, as based on observations for decelerating electron radiation in a storage ring in
synchrotron experiments [4], which is no diﬀerent from an orbiting atomic electron
except for its macroscopic orbital size.

→

(iii) It follows from (i)–(ii) combined with momentum conservation condition that
the transition electron coming oﬀ at A, will migrate across shortest-distance AB,
perpendicular to un+1, to orbit n, at B if the atom is at rest, or at B′ if the atom is

The wave and dynamic variables for the nonstationary transition process would
not be a simple diﬀerence between the solutions for the stationary statesm. However,
we can try to represent the process eﬀectively using an apparent source such that

(v.1) the total wave detached from the apparent sour-ce gives the same observed

radiation as due to the actual source; and

(v.2) the apparent source in transition has the same motion as the (actual source
item iv) in

of the) transition electron, that is, translating at the velocity v (cf.
+x-direction here.

5 A theoretical formula for the redshift

In fulﬁlling (v.1), the apparent source ought to be an oscillatory charge (q) executing
in stationary state circular motion at velocity ua on orbit n + 1 (insets in Figure 2).
Let ﬁrst the orbit n + 1 be at rest, v = 0, and so must be the apparent source as by
(v.2). The apparent source generates two identical monochromatic electromagnetic
waves traveling oppositely along orbit n + 1, of wavevectors k†
a0 = ka0, which
superpose into a single electromagnetic wave ψka0. On transition, the source emits
the entire ψka0 in the direction parallel with ua(θ), by simply detaching it; thus
ka0 ≡
Let now orbit n + 1 be in motion at velocity v in +x-direction, and so must be
the apparent source. Let the source comes oﬀ orbit n + 1 at point A1 (Figure 2b). In
a brief time δt before this, the apparent source was essentially at A1 and generating
two waves ϕ†
parallel and antiparallel with ua, thus v; their wavelengths were owing

detaches the entire single beat wave ψka, which is no longer ”regulated” by the source

6 Discussion

From the forgoing analysis of the direct experimental spectral data of Ives and Stilwell
on hydrogen canal rays, and with the elucidation of the underlying mechanism, we
conclude without ambiguity that, the spectral emission of a moving hydrogen atom
exhibits always a redshift compared to that from an atom at rest; the faster the atom
moves, the redder-shift it shows. This is not an ordinary Doppler eﬀect associated
with a conventional moving source, but rather is an energy deﬁciency resulting from
the de Broglie electron kinetic energy gain in transition to a moving frame, a common
feature elucidated in [7] to be exhibited by the deceleration radiation of all de Broglie
particles. This redshift does not inform the direction of motion of the source (the
atom).

It is on the other hand possible for an atomic spectral emission to exhibit blue
shift for other reasons, for example, when the observer is moving toward the source as
based on Galilean transformation. The author thanks P-I Johansson for his support
of the research and the Studsvik library for helping acquiring needed literature.

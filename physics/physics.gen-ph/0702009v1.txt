Comment on “Taleyarkhan et al. Reply:”

In their Reply [1] to my previous Comment [2],
Taleyarkhan and coauthors measure their detectors’ re-
sponses to a 252Cf source, concluding that the result-
ing spectra diﬀer substantially from the cavitation-fusion
spectra published earlier in their Letter [3]. On the con-
trary, I conclude that the two data sets are qualitatively
consistent.

NE-213 neutron spectra. To compare proton-recoil
spectra, their scales must ﬁrst be calibrated, typically
to equivalent electron energy via γ calibration sources.
Though the authors provided 137Cs and 60Co γ calibra-
tions in their Letter (see Fig. 1(a) of my previous Com-
ment), in their Reply, they do not provide a γ calibration
along with their 252Cf spectrum. Nevertheless, their de-
tector’s response to 252Cf, and the corresponding 137Cs
and 60Co γ calibrations, are given in Figs. 5(b) and 4 of
Ref. [4]. Comparison of the calibrated and the uncali-
brated 252Cf spectra shows that the detector’s gain was
approximately 10% less in the Reply than in the Let-
ter. Using this calibration for the Reply spectrum, Fig. 1
shows the Reply’s 252Cf spectrum to be consistent with
the Letter’s cavitation-fusion spectrum.

tion fusion γ signal. For example, the peak at channel 14,
also present in their undeuterated control runs, is due to
40K’s 1.46 MeV γ, the predominant feature of the terres-
trial γ background [8]. These features do not appear in
the Reply spectrum because their relatively intense 252Cf
source, placed only 30 cm from the detector, overwhelms
the natural γ background.

The appropriate comparison would be between the
252Cf γ spectrum and the background-subtracted
cavitation-fusion γ signal.
In this case, however, the
subtracted signal is a small fraction of the background,
and the error on a channel’s count diﬀerence would be
of greater magnitude than the diﬀerence itself. For ex-
ample, in channel 14, there were approximately 970 ‘on’
counts and 940 ‘oﬀ’ counts, yielding a diﬀerence of
30 ± 40. Such a comparison would therefore be unfortu-
nately inadequate to distinguish between 252Cf and DD-
fusion.

In conclusion, Taleyarkhan and coauthors’ cavitation-

FIG. 1: (color online). The aggregate background-subtracted
cavitation-fusion proton-recoil spectrum (Fig. 12 of the Let-
ter’s supplement [5]) compared with the 252Cf spectrum from
the Reply. Note that the “PRL” spectrum from Fig. 1(a)
of the Reply is the same as the cavitation-fusion spectrum
here, though data below channel 10 were removed from the
Reply. As discussed in the text, the Reply spectrum is cross-
calibrated to have a gain of 10% less than the Letter spec-
trum. For qualitative comparison, the simulated DD-fusion
response from my previous Comment, with arbitrary vertical
normalization, is also shown. See Refs. [6, 7] for examples of
experimental DD-fusion proton-recoil spectra.

NaI(Tl) gamma spectra.

In Fig. 1(b) of the Reply,
the authors compare their “cavitation on” γ spectrum
against an experimental 252Cf γ spectrum. As shown
in Fig. 15(a) of the Letter’s supplement [5] (reproduced
here in Fig. 2), the “cavitation on” spectrum is within ap-
proximately 2% of the “cavitation oﬀ” background spec-
trum. Consequently, they are comparing the 252Cf spec-
trum against the natural γ background, not the cavita-

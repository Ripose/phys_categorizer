Farewell to General Relativity

The kinematical successes of general relativity are legendary: the peri-
helion precession, the gravitational red-shift, the bending of light. However,
at the level of dynamics, relativity is faced with insurmountable diﬃculties.
It has failed to deﬁne the energy, momentum, and stress of the gravitational
ﬁeld. Moreover, it oﬀers no expression of energy-momentum transfer to or
from the gravitational ﬁeld. These are symptoms of a far graver malady:
general relativity violates the principle of energy conservation.

We begin with the description of planetary motion in general relativity.
In geometrical terms, the planetary trajectories are determined by minimiz-
ing the distance through four-dimensional space-time

gµν dxµdxν = 0

This yields the geodesic equation

αβuαuβ = 0

where uµ = dxµ/ds. A more kinematical approach is to start with the
components uµ and the equation for geodesic motion in ﬂat rectangular
coordinates

Substitute ﬂat spherical coordinates, xµ′

We then adopt this generally covariant equation for all systems of coor-
dinates, ﬂat or curved. The kinematical method can be recast in vectorial
form, by introducing a basis system eµ. The basis vectors change from point
to point in the manifold, according to the formula

The rate of change of the vector u = eµuµ is equal to zero in all coordinate
systems

and we regain the geodesic equation from the perspective of four-vector
particle kinematics.

How do these formulae relate to the observed planetary motion? Ex-

panding u = e0u0 + eiui, we have

d(e0u0)
ds

d(eiui)
ds

= 0

(9)

This shows that, during geodesic motion, the rate of change of three-velocity,
eiui, is equal and opposite to that of speed, e0u0. The rates are explicitly
given by

d(e0u0)

In ﬂat spherical coordinates, the right-hand side of this equation is zero:
both velocity and speed are constant.
In Schwarzschild coordinates, the
right-hand side is not zero: speed and velocity continually change. Thus,
according to the geodesic hypothesis, the variations which we observe in a
planet’s speed and velocity are due to the curved geometry of space-time.
The success of the geodesic formula was one of the great triumphs of 20th
century physics. Yet, we know that a planet possesses dynamical properties
of energy and momentum. What is taking place at this, the dynamical level?
The energy-momentum vector of a planet is

p = mu

= eµpµ = e0p0 + eipi

The ﬁrst term is the rest + kinetic energy, e0p0, while the second term is
the momentum, eipi. During geodesic motion, the rate of change of the
energy-momentum vector is clearly zero

dp

{

Therefore, the rates of change of energy and momentum are equal and op-
posite

(11)

(12)

(13)

Neither the planet’s energy nor its momentum is conserved; rather, one
continually transforms into the other. During orbital motion, the non-
conservation of linear momentum is to be expected. What surprises is that

energy conservation is violated. The energy principle forces us to abandon
the geodesic hypothesis of planetary motion.

The treatment of light-rays is similar to that of particle motion, in that
the bending of light and the gravitational red-shift are determined by the
kinematics of curved space-time. The red-shift can be expressed in terms of
the null vector

k = e0k0 + eiki
where e0k0 is the frequency of light, and eiki is its wave vector. The vector
k is constant along any light ray

(14)

and we obtain

dλ

d(eiki)

Therefore, in the presence of space-time curvature, the frequency and wave-
length will vary from point to point along the light ray. This is the gravita-
tional red-shift.

The energy-momentum vector of a light complex is given by the quantum

formula

Once again, energy-momentum is conserved, dp/dλ = 0, and

p = ¯hk

d(e0p0)

d(eipi)

Thus, as frequency and wavelength change, the energy and momentum trans-
form into one another; neither is conserved.

The above examples illustrate the violation of energy conservation during
geodesic motion. We will now make use of the ﬁeld equations to show that
this problem is intrinsic to the theory, and stems from the fact that the
gravitational ﬁeld is incapable of exchanging energy-momentum with any
physical ﬁeld. The ﬁeld equations are given by

This result is especially signiﬁcant, because it shows that there is no mech-
anism whatsoever for the exchange of energy-momentum between the elec-
tromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds. The energy-momentum of electromag-
netism alone is conserved.

Secondly, consider the matter tensor

The Lorentz force describes the exchange of energy-momentum between
matter and the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

These examples show that whether space-time is curved or not, i.e.,
whether a gravitational ﬁeld exists or not, the energy-momentum of matter
and electromagnetism is conserved. It follows that any change wrought by
curvature—in speed, velocity, frequency, and wavelength—will violate the
principle of energy conservation. A gravitational exchange term is needed in
order to account for the changes in energy and momentum. The theory of
relativity neither provides such a term nor deﬁnes the energy, momentum,
and stress of the gravitational ﬁeld. If we adhere to the energy principle,
then general relativity cannot be the answer to the question of gravitation.

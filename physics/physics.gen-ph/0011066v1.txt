Introduction

General Relativity makes a distinction between mass and space. Mass tells space
how to curve and space tells mass how to move. Newtonian gravity equation makes
a distinction between them by having its numerator as mass eﬀect and its denom-
inator as inverse square law space eﬀect at macroscopic approximation. At micro-
scopic distances it makes sense to substitute surface-to-surface distance between
two nucleons for center-to-center distance between them to account for the mass
space distinction, keeping in mind the smallest distance between coupled nucleons
is Planck length. Any distance less than Planck makes no sense in the classical
world. When we calculate the force between two nucleons of one femtometer diam-
eter each, separated by a surface-to-surface distance of Planck length, we get the
force that matches well known nuclear force i.e. 1040 times the value of the force of
gravitation “g” calculated by assuming the Newtonian center-to-center distance of
1 femtometer. What we get is what is described as the nuclear force in scientiﬁc lit-
erature. This leads to the question: Is the nuclear force (well recognized secondary
eﬀect of color force) high intensity gravitation?

2 Analysis

Consider the following equations (1) and (2). The notation dn in Equation (2) is
the diameter of the nucleons in question.

Newtonian FN = Gm1xm2/D

2

Proposed FP = Gm1xm2/(D − dn)2

(1)

(2)

The notation D in the denominator in Newton’s equation (1) of the gravitational
force denotes the separating distance between the centers of mass of the particles
in question. The validity of equation (1) has been veriﬁed for distances as low
as a few centimeters.
Its validity is not veriﬁed when the subatomic separating
distance between nuclei of atoms is a few femtometers (fm). Newton’s equation
is an approximation that explains macroscopic observations. If Newton meant his
equation to hold true at microscopic distances, he would have explained the binding

energy. Newtonian physics implies point masses and action between points. A point
has no mass. I am asserting that, instead, the classically deterministic Newtonian
gravity originates at the surfaces of nucleons, not at a central point within the
nucleons. I am not addressing electrons and coulomb forces in this paper. This
paper is dedicated to the investigation of the nuclear force alone at this stage.
The deviation from inverse square logic resulting from our proposal is insigniﬁcant.
The consequences of mass and space microscopic distinction are enormous. The
proposed correction is the injection of dn. Equation (2) is good for all distances
greater than Planck length (10−35 meters = 10−20 fm). I require the Planck length
as a lower bound so as to include the dominant ﬁrst order quantum eﬀect in this
classical model. The relative strength of the proposed equation is the ratio obtained
by dividing equation (2) by equation (1), which is

The ratio FP /FN = D2/(D − dn)2.

3 Strength of Gravity at Short Range per Eqn. (2)

When D is very large compared to dn, D2 is almost equal to (D − dn)2. The diam-
eter of atoms is hundreds of millions of times greater than the diameter of nucleons
located at the center of atoms. The force of gravitation calculated by these two
equations between the nucleons of two adjoining atoms is practically the same, be-
cause the ratio D2/(D − dn)2 is almost equal to one. When D is small compared to
dn, the force of attraction calculated by equation (2) will be signiﬁcantly greater
than that calculated by equation (1). The following results bring home the con-
cept. If we call the force of gravitation calculated by equation (1) “g”, the force of
gravitation calculated by equation (2) would be higher by the ratio D2/(D − dn)2.
When D exceeds dn, by Planck length (10−20 fm), one obtains the ratio:

D2/(D − dn)2 = (dn+ Planck length)2/(Planck length)2
= (1 + 10−20)2/(10−20)2
= 1040.

(All lenghts in femtometers)
(dn = 1 femtometer)

At surface to surface separations of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10 femtometers, the calculated
nuclear forces rapidly diminish to 4.0, 2.1, 1.77, 1.56 and 1.23 times the gravita-
tional forces respectively and match Newtonian gravitation at 1000 femtometers
as tabulated below. My calculations meet the observed boundary values. Nucleon
deformation is neglected.

4 Analogy

Considering a hollow metal sphere containing smaller metal balls rumbling inside the
sphere, a probe inside the sphere or close to the outside surface would detect non-
central high intensity, indeterministic noise with intensity increasing with distance
from the center. For a distant listener, the sound would be of deterministic nature
originating from the center of the sphere with its intensity decreasing with distance.
Indeterministic high intensity noise at a short range is deterministic low intensity
sound at large distances. What this analogy brings home is that the color force
is potentially the high intensity, non-central, classically indeterministic interaction.
The gravity is potentially the low intensity, macroscopically central, Newtonian
deterministic manifestation of the same fundamental interaction. I am taking the
liberty to use the prevailing view that the nuclear force is the secondary eﬀect of
the color force to reach the following conclusion. This view does not need to be
reestablished.

5 Conjectures

(A) We do not have quantum gravity: gravity is potentially not a separate funda-

mental interaction of Nature.

(B) Rutherford’s scattering experiments showed nuclear forces as far as 10 fem-
tometers [2]: not that they do not exist beyond that range. At higher distances
they are too weak to detect.

(C) There is no proof of a central force detected inside the nucleons.

(D) Despite its theoretical justiﬁcation, Yukawa potential does not predict the

observations.

(E) There is no feature of nuclear force that distinguishes it from gravitation.

(F) Einstein attempted to explain nuclear force in terms of gravity [1].

(G) The Standard Model does not incorporate gravity.

6 Conclusions

Newtonian gravitation is potentially a deterministic manifestation of the classically
indeterminate color forces addressed in QCD. The prevailing view is that the nu-
clear force is the secondary eﬀect of the color force. The proposed theory connects
the nuclear force with gravitation in one common equation. The combined contri-
butions of these two clearly imply that gravitation is the Newtonian deterministic
manifestation of the classically indeterminate color forces.

Hyper-Hamiltonian quantum mechanics

Abstract

We present a modiﬁcation of quantum mechanics with a possible
worlds semantics. It is shown that ‘gauge’ degrees of freedom along
possible worlds can be used to encode gravitational information.

1 Preliminaries.

It is known that Schr¨odinger evolution is Hamiltonian evolution on a mani-
fold canonically associated to the Hilbert space (see, e. g., [6] and references
therein). In this note we combine the kinematics of the semi-geometrical ap-
proach with the hyper-Hamiltonian formalism ([3], [4]) to incorporate gravity
into the description of quantum systems.
Remark 1.1 (Notations). N denotes natural numbers, R and C are the ﬁelds
of real and complex numbers, respectively. Small Latin indices i, j, k take
values in N; small Greek indices, α, β, γ and small Latin indices p, q always
run 0 to 3 and 1 to 3, respectively. Summation is assumed on repeated
indices of diﬀerent levels unless explicitly indicated otherwise. For structural
clarity we use 2 at the end of a Proof, and each Remark ends with the sign
3
appearing at the end of this line.

Deﬁnition 1.1. An F-algebra, A, is an ordered pair (SA, A), where SA is a
vector space over a ﬁeld F, and A is a ( 1
2 )-tensor on SA, called the structure
tensor of A. Each vector a of SA is called an element of A, denoted a ∈ A.
The dimensionality of A is that of SA.

Remark 1.2. The tensor A induces a binary operation SA × SA → SA, called
the multiplication of A: to each pair of vectors (a, b) the tensor A associates

V. Trifonov

A. An F-algebra
A → F, such that ab(˜τ ) = A(˜τ , a, b), ∀τ ∈ S∗
a vector ab : S∗
with an associative multiplication is called associative. An element ı, such
3
that aı = ıa = a, ∀a ∈ A is called an identity of A.

Deﬁnition 1.2. For each F-algebra A = (SA, A), an F-algebra [A] = (SA, ¯A),
where ¯A(˜τ , a, b) := A(˜τ , a, b) − A(˜τ , b, a), ∀a, b ∈ SA, is called the commu-
tator algebra of A.

Deﬁnition 1.3. For an F-algebra A and each nonzero one-form ˜τ ∈ S∗
A,
the tensor GA := ˜τ yA is called a principal metric of A, just in case it is
symmetric, where y denotes contraction on the ﬁrst index.

Remark 1.3. For an R-algebra A, its vector space SA canonically generates a
(linear) manifold SA with the same carrier, so we have a bijection J : SA →
SA. We distinguish between the two objects, using the normal (a, u, ...)
and bold (a, u, ...) fonts, respectively, to denote their elements. The tangent
space TaSA is identiﬁed with SA at each point a ∈ SA via an isomorphism J∗
a :
TaSA → SA sending a tangent vector to the curve µ : R → SA, µ(t) = a + tu,
at the point µ(0), to the vector u ∈ SA, with the “total” map J∗ : T SA → SA.
A linear map F : SA → SA induces a vector ﬁeld f : SA → T SA on SA, such
that the following diagram commutes,

Deﬁnition 1.4. A left module over an algebra A is a vector space V together
with a bilinear map A × V → V .

Deﬁnition 1.5. A ﬁnite dimensional associative R-algebra with an identity
is called a unital algebra.

Lemma 1.1. The set A of all invertible elements of a unital algebra A is a
submanifold of SA, and a Lie group with respect to the multiplication of A.
The Lie algebra of A is the commutator algebra [A]. The vector space of the
Lie algebra of A is SA, and therefore SA is the tangent space TıA of A at the
identity of the group A.

Hyper-Hamiltonian QM

Proof. See, for example, [5] for a proof of this simple lemma.

Remark 1.4. For each basis (ej) on the vector space SA of a unital algebra,
there is a natural basis (ﬁeld) on A, namely the basis (ˆej) of left invariant
3
vector ﬁelds generated by (ej). We call (ˆej) a proper basis.

Deﬁnition 1.6. For a unital algebra A, let (ˆej) be a proper basis on A,
generated by a basis (ej) on SA. The structure ﬁeld of the Lie group A is a
tensor ﬁeld A on A, assigning to each point a ∈ A a ( 1
2 )-tensor Aa on TaA,
with components (Aa)i

jk in the basis (ˆej), deﬁned by

(Aa)i

jk := Ai

jk,

∀a ∈ A,

where Ai

jk are the components of the structure tensor A in the basis (ej).

Deﬁnition 1.7. For a unital algebra A and a one-form ﬁeld ˜τ on A, a
tensor ﬁeld gA = ˜τ yA is called a proper metric (ﬁeld) of A, provided it is
symmetric.

2 Quaternion algebra

Deﬁnition 2.1. A four dimensional R-algebra, H = (SH, H), is called a
quaternion algebra (with quaternions as its elements), if there is a basis (eβ)
on SH, in which the components of the structure tensor H are given by the
entries of the following matrices,

(2)

Such a basis is called a canonical basis, and its vectors are denoted 1, i,
j, k. A quaternion algebra is unital, with the ﬁrst vector of the canonical
basis, 1, as its identity. Since (1, i, j, k) is a basis on a real vector space,
any quaternion a can be presented as a01 + a1i + a2j + a3k, aβ ∈ R. A

4

V. Trifonov

quaternion ¯a = a01 − a1i − a2j − a3k is called conjugate to a. We refer to
a0 and apip as the real and imaginary part of a, respectively. Quaternions
of the form a01 are in one-to-one correspondence with real numbers, which
is often denoted, with certain notational abuse, as R ⊂ H.
Remark 2.1. A linear transformation SH → SH with the following compo-
nents in the canonical basis,

1 0
0 B(cid:19)

(cid:18)

, B ∈ SO(3),

takes (1, i, j, k) to a basis (iβ) in which the components (2) of the structure
tensor will not change, and neither will the multiplicative behavior of vectors
of (iβ). Thus, we have a class of canonical bases parameterized by elements
of SO(3). The notions of conjugation as well as the real and imaginary parts
3
are clearly invariant under the canonical basis change.
Remark 2.2. The vector space SH induces, via the process (1), a manifold
SH, with the canonical identiﬁcation TaSH ∼= SH, ∀a ∈ SH.

3 Principal metrics of H.

Lemma 3.1. Each principal metric of a quaternion algebra is a Minkowski
metric.

Proof. For a basis eβ in SH let ˜τβ be the components of a one-form ˜τ in the
dual basis eβ. Then the components GH

αβ of the principal metric are

GH
αβ = ˜τγHγ
αβ are the components of H. In a canonical basis we have:

αβ,

where Hγ

The only way to make this matrix symmetric is to put ˜τ1 = −˜τ1, ˜τ2 = −˜τ2,
˜τ3 = −˜τ3, which yields ˜τ1 = ˜τ2 = ˜τ3 = 0:

Thus for each ˜τ ∈ R \ {0}, the quaternion algebra H has a principal metric
of signature 2, generated by a one-form ˜τ with the components (˜τ , 0, 0, 0) in
the canonical basis, which concludes the proof, [7].

4 Natural coordinates and bases on H and H.

Every nonzero element of a quaternion algebra, H, is invertible. Therefore
the Lie group H of invertible elements of H is the set of nonzero quaternions
together with the multiplication on H. Each canonical basis (iβ) induces a
coordinate system (w, x, y, z) on SH and therefore also on its submanifold
H: a quaternion a = aβiβ is assigned coordinates (w = a0, x = a1, y = a2,
z = a3). This coordinate system covers both SH and H with a single patch.
Since 0 /∈ H, at least one of the coordinates is always nonzero for any point
a ∈ H. For a diﬀerentiable function R : R → R \ {0} there is a system
of natural spherical coordinates (η, χ, θ, φ) on H, related to the canonical
coordinates by

w = R(η) cos(χ),

x = R(η) sin(χ) sin(θ) cos(φ),
y = R(η) sin(χ) sin(θ) sin(φ),

z = R(η) sin(χ) cos(θ).

There are several natural basis ﬁelds on H induced by each canonical basis
(iβ) on SH. First of all, we have a (noncoordinate) proper basis (ˆıβ). There
are also two coordinate bases, (∂w, ∂x, ∂y, ∂z) and the corresponding spherical
coordinate basis (∂η, ∂χ, ∂θ, ∂φ).

5 Proper metrics of H.

Theorem 5.1. All proper metrics of H are closed Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-
Robertson-Walker.

Proof. A left invariant vector ﬁeld f on H, generated by a vector f 0 ∈ SH,
with components (f α
0 ) in the coordinate basis, associates to each point a ∈ H
with coordinates (w, x, y, z) a vector f (a) ∈ TaH with the components
f β = (af 0)β in the coordinate basis:

f 0 = wf 0

0 − yf 2

0 − xf 1
f 2 = wf 2

0 − xf 3

0 − zf 3
0 ,
0 + yf 0

f 1 = wf 1
0 + zf 1

0 + xf 0
f 3 = wf 3

0 + yf 3

0 − zf 2
0 ,
0 − yf 1

0 + xf 2

0 + zf 0
0 .

The system (3) contains suﬃcient information to compute transformation
between the bases. For example, the transformation between the spherical
and the proper basis is given by

where ˙R 6≡ 0. We know that for each ˜τ ∈ R a one-form ˜τ with components
(˜τ , 0, 0, 0) in (the dual of) a canonical basis (iβ) converts the structure
tensor into a principal metric. In order for a one-form ﬁeld ˜τ to generate a
proper metric, it has to have the components (˜τ (a), 0, 0, 0) in the proper
basis (ˆıβ), with ˜τ (a) : H → R. It is easy to see that only a one-form of this
kind is capable of producing a symmetrical tensor. In the spherical basis ˜τ
has components ((R/ ˙R)˜τ , 0, 0, 0), which means that ˜τ must depend only on
η. Then its contraction with the structure ﬁeld H produces a proper metric
whose components in the spherical basis are

6 Hyper-Hamiltonian dynamics.

Deﬁnition 6.1. Let M and N be hyperk¨ahler manifolds with hypercomplex
structures IM
p , respectively. A smooth map F : M → N is called
quaternionic if there exists an SO(3) matrix B such that

p and IN

p = dF,

where dF is the diﬀerential of F, [2].

For a canonical basis (iβ) on H we can express the values of a quaternionic
map F : M → SH in the canonical coordinates (w, x, y, z), which produces a
quadruple (Fβ) of real-valued functions on M, the components of F in the
basis (iβ).

Deﬁnition 6.2. For a quaternionic map F : M → SH, its hyper -Hamiltonian
vector ﬁeld f on M is deﬁned by

dF0 = f yg,

(5)

where g is the Riemannian metric on M.

Remark 6.1. Since the decomposition of F into real and imaginary parts is
invariant under the canonical basis change, so is the deﬁnition of a hyper-
3
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld.

The notion of a hyper-Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld was introduced in [3] and
[4], where it was shown that (5) is a superposition of three Hamiltonian
evolutions:

f = f 1 + f 2 + f 3,

dFp = f p

y ˜ωp,

where ( ˜ωp) is the triple of symplectic forms on M, and there is no summation
on p. An example of an integrable hyper-Hamiltonian system (quaternionic
oscillator ) is given in [3].

F : V → V is called a quaternion linear operator, if

Deﬁnition 7.3. A quaternionic Hilbert space is an ordered pair (V, h· | ·i),
where V is a quaternionic vector space, and h· | ·i is a map V × V → H,
called a Hermitian inner product, such that

hφ | ψ + ξi = hφ, ψi + hφ | ξi,

hφ | ψi = hψ | φi,
k φ k2:= hφ, φi ∈ R, k φ k2> 0,

hφ, aψi = ahφ, ψi,
∀φ 6= 0,
∀φ, ψ, ξ ∈ V, ∀a ∈ H,

and the diagonal k · k induces a topology on V , relative to which V is
separable and complete [1].

Deﬁnition 7.4. For a quaternionic Hilbert space (V, h· | ·i) and a quaternion

where gξ is a positive-deﬁnite inner product and ( ˜ωp

the maps gξ and ( ˜ωp
ξ) constitute strongly nondegenerate tensor ﬁelds on SV ,

namely, a Riemannian metric g and a triple of symplectic forms, ( ˜ωp). In
the same manner, a quadruple of operators ı′

β on V , deﬁned by

ı′
β(φ) := iβφ,

∀φ ∈ V

generate a quadruple (Iβ) of ( 1
1 )-tensor ﬁelds on SV . The ﬁrst one, I0 is
the identity transformation on each tangent space TξSV , and the last three
make up an almost hypercomplex structure on SV . These tensors form a
hyperk¨ahler structure on SV :

g(φ, ψ) = g(Ip(φ), Ip(ψ)),

g(φ, ψ) = ˜ωp(φ, Ip(ψ)),

˜ωp(φ, ψ) = ˜ωp(Ip(φ), Ip(ψ)),

(no summation on p), which makes (Ip) a hypercomplex structure on SV .

8 Axioms of HH quantum mechanics.

Since V is a left module over H, there is a left action of the group H on
the set of nonzero vectors of V , which induces a natural principal H-bundle
(P, P/H, π, H), with the total space P := SV \ {0}. The base space is the
quaternionic projective space P/H, and the projection π assigns to each φ its
orbit Wφ. The standard ﬁber is H. The ﬁber diﬀeomorphism σ : H ∼= Wφ
assigns to each a ∈ H a point aφ ∈ Wφ.

In order to avoid technical complications, the axioms below are given for

the case of discrete set of eigenvalues with no degeneracy.

Axiom 1 (The system and the perception template). To a physical system the
observer associates a bundle P, called the propensity domain, together with
a smooth real function H → R, such that gH := dτ yH is symmetric. The
system is characterized by its local propensities, ordered triples (φ, Wφ, φ),
where φ ∈ V is called a state of the system, and φ ∈ P is a presence mode
of the state φ in a possible world Wφ. The manifold H is interpreted as the
perception template (of the observer with respect to the system), with τ and
gH as its global time and proper metric, respectively.
Axiom 2 (Observables). Each measurable quantity is represented by an or-
F , f ), where F is a quaternionic map P → SH, called an
dered triple (F,
F is an anti-Hermitian operator V → V , called the lineal of the
observable,

b

10

V. Trifonov

F coincides with the imaginary part of
observable, such that expectation of
F; and f is a vector ﬁeld on P, called the direction ﬁeld of the observable,
b
such that dF0 = f yg. For each eigenvector ψ of
F , its presence mode ψ is
called an eigenmode of the observable F, and F(ψ) - an eigenvalue of F. The
possible world Wψ is called the eigenworld of F.
Axiom 3 (Dynamics). Left alone, the system evolves according to dH0 = hyg,
along the direction ﬁeld h of a preferred observable, H, the hyper -Hamiltonian
of the system, such that the following diagram commutes for each possible
world W:

where j is the inclusion map, and σ : W → H is the ﬁber diﬀeomorphism.

Axiom 4 (Measurement). A measurement of an observable F performed on
a system is an assignment to the system of a hypersurface in an eigenworld
of F. A result of a measurement of an observable F is an ordered triple
(φ, a, δ), where φ and a are an eigenmode and the corresponding eigenvalue
of F, respectively; δ is a hypersurface in Wφ, called the carrier of the system,
deﬁned by

δ = {ψ ∈ Wφ | τ ′(ψ) = t},

where t is the real part of a and τ ′ is the pullback of τ under the ﬁber
diﬀeomorphism σ : Wφ → H. The eigenvalue a can be given as an ordered
pair (t, x) where t is interpreted as the time of realization of the system
in the eigenworld Wφ, and x is a pure imaginary quaternion, interpreted as
the value of the measurement. When a canonical basis iβ is speciﬁed, the
value of the measurement is given by an ordered triple of real numbers. The
geometry of δ is deﬁned by a metric gδ, the restriction of the metric gWφ of
the eigenworld Wφ deﬁned by the pullback of the proper metric gH under
the ﬁber diﬀeomorphism σ.

Axiom 5 (Probability). If the system is in a state φ, then the probability P
that a measurement of F will return a result (ψ, a, δ) is given by

P =

hφ | ψihψ | φi
hφ | φihψ | ψi

Thus standard QM can be embedded in HHQM. The geometric capacity of

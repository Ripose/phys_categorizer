Abstract

Translational invariance requires that physical predictions are independent of the choice
of spatial coordinate system used. The time dilatation eﬀect of special relativity is shown
to manifestly respect this invariance. Consideration of the space-time Lorentz transformation
with arbitary spatial coordinates shows that the spurious ‘length contraction’ and ‘relativity
of simultaneity’ eﬀects –the latter violating translational invariance– result from the use of a
diﬀerent spatial coordinate system to describe each of two spatially separated clocks at rest in
a common inertial frame
PACS 03.30.+p

Translational invariance is a mathematical expression of the homogeneity of physical
space –the result of an experiment governed only by internal conditions does not depend
on where, in space, it is performed. A corollary is that the prediction of the result of
any such experiment does not depend on the choice of spatial coordinates used for its
physical description. This is because moving the experiment to a diﬀerent spatial position
is mathematically equivalent to a change of the origins of coordinate axes ~x → ~x − ~x0. In
this letter, it is demonstrated that the space-time Lorentz transformation –when correctly
interpreted– respects translational invariance, as just deﬁned. As will be explained below,
this is not the case in the conventional Einsteinian [1] interpretation of the transformation.
It is instructive to ﬁrst discuss the space transformation equation in the context of
Galilean relativity. With a particular choice of coordinate axes, the Galilean space trans-
formation for an object at rest in the inertial frame S’, as observed in another such frame
S, is:

x′ = x − vt = 0

This equation describes an object at rest at the origin of S’ that moves with uniform
velocity, v, along the +ve x-axis in S. It is assumed that there is an array of synchronised
clocks at rest in S and that t is the time recorded by any such clock. The spatial coordinate
system in S is chosen so that x = 0 when t = 0. Introducing a more explicit notation and
arbitary coordinate origins in S and S’, Eqn(1) generalises to:

x′(t) − x′(0) = x(t) − x(0) − vt = 0

(1)

(2)

Thus x′(t) = x′(0) for all values of t, while the equation of motion of the object in S
is given by the last member of (2). The ‘transformation equation’ (2) is actually two
separate and independent equations:

x′(t) = x′(0)
x(t) = x(0) + vt

(3)
(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

The spatial Lorentz transformation corresponding to Eqn(2) is:

x′(t) − x′(0) = γ[x(t) − x(0) − vt] = 0

like (2),

is equivalent to (3) and (4).

In fact the multiplicative factor: γ ≡
This,
1/p1 − (v/c)2 in (5) may be replaced by an arbitary ﬁnite function of v/c and the trans-
formation will still be equivalent to (3) and (4). The spatial description of the moving
object is therefore identical for the Galilean and Lorentz transformations.

The temporal Lorentz transformation corresponding to (5) is:

t′(t) = γ[t −

v(x(t) − x(0))
c2

]

The physical meaning of t′(t) is the time recorded by a local clock at the position of the
object in S’ as observed, at time t, in the frame S. Because both t and x(t) appear on the
right side of (6) one may think that t′(t) depends on both t and x(t). This is Einstein’s
‘relativity of simultaneity’ (RS) eﬀect. However, (4) may be used to eliminate x(t) from
the right side of (6) to yield the time dilatation (TD) formula ﬁrst derived, in this way,
directly from the Lorentz transformation, by Einstein [1]:

t = γt′(t)

Since no spatial coordinates appear in this equation, it manifestly respects translational
invariance. Also the clock in S’ is ‘system externally synchronised’ [2] so that t′(0) = 0.

2(t) –there is no RS eﬀect. Indeed this follows from the the fact that t’

1(t) = t′

so that t′
in Eqn(7) is a function only of t, not of t and x(t).
Consider now arbitary space time-points (x′

j(0),t′

j) on the world line of the clock Cj’
(j = 1, 2), and denote by (xj(tj),tj) (j = 1, 2),the same events Lorentz-transformed into
the frame S. The Lorentz transformation (5) and (6) may be used to derive a space-like
invariant interval relation between these space-time points:

(∆s)2 = [x′

2(0) − x′

1(0)]2 − c2[t′

2(t2) − t′

1(t1)]2 = [x2(t2) − x1(t1)]2 − c2[t2 − t1]2

(9)

Since the parameters x(0) and x′(0) specifying the spatial coordinate origins, and the
parameter β ≡ v/c characterising the Lorentz transformation, do not appear in (9), ∆s
is both translation- and Lorentz-invariant. The spatial separation between C1’ and C2’

2

in the frame S is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between their x-coordinates at some particular
instant t1 = t2 = t:

It then follows from Eqns(8)-(10) that

L ≡ x2(t) − x1(t)

∆s = L = x2(t) − x1(t) = L′ = x′

2(0) − x′

1(0)

Thus the spatial separation of the clocks is a Lorentz-invariant quantity [3] –there is, in
this case, no relativistic ‘length contraction’ (LC).

How the spurious and correlated RS and LC eﬀects of conventional special relativity
arise will now be explained. Following Einstein [1] the choice x(0) = x′(0) = 0 is made
in the general Lorentz transformation (5) and (6) to give :
x′(t) = γ[x(t) − vt] = 0

Since the TD relation (7) does not depend on the choice of spatial coordinate system, it
holds also when (12) and (13) are used. If the clock C1’ is placed at x′
1(0) = 0,
it is, according to (12) and (13), synchronised so that t′
1(t = 0) = 0. The ‘LC eﬀect’ is
derived by subsitituting the coordinates of the clock C2’, placed at x′
2(t) = x′
2(0) = L′ in
the ﬁrst member of space transformation equation (12) and setting t = 0. This procedure
is aleady in contradiction with the last member of (12) since it is assumed, in making
this subsitution, that L′ 6= 0. After the above substitution in (12) the following equation
is written down:

1(t) = x′

2(0) − x′
x′

1(0) = L′ = γ[x2(0) − x1(0)] = γL

This is the ‘LC eﬀect’. However, the assumption on which (14) is based. x′
0, is inconsistent with the the formula from which (14) is derived:

1(0) = x1(0) =

Comparing with the general formula (5) it can be seen that (15) requires that

2(t) = L′ = γ[x2(t) − vt] 6= 0
x′

x′(0) = L′ = γx(0)
2(0) = L′ = γx2(0)
x′

Thus in (15) a diﬀerent coordinate system is used in the frame S to speciﬁy the position
of C2’ to the one used to specify the position of C1’, in Eqns(12) and (13) where x′(0) =
x(0) = 0. In fact, with the coordinate system corresponding to (15), x2(0) = L′/γ and it
follows that x1(0) is not zero but rather

x1(0) = x2(0) − L = L′/γ − L

The Lorentz transformations for C1’ and C2’ using the coordinate systems deﬁned by (16)
are therefore:

(18) and (20) give

so that

x1(t) = L′/γ − L + vt
x2(t) = L′/γ + vt

x2(t) − x1(t) = L

It can be seen that the spurious ‘LC eﬀect’ of (14) is a consequence of using diﬀerent
coordinate systems to describe the two clocks: x′(0) = x(0) = 0 for C1’ and x′(0) =
L′ = γx(0) for C2’. When the latter system is used for both clocks, as in (18)-(21), the
LC eﬀect does not occur. The equality of L and L′ (Eqn(11)), in contradiction with
(14), follows from the invariant interval relation (9) which is independent of the choice of
coordinate system; i.e. the values of x(0) and x′(0) in (5) and (6).

If it is incorrectly assumed that x(0) = 0 in (6), applied to the clock C2’, when the

condition (15) is satisﬁed, it is found, instead of (21) that

spurious dependence of t′
Similar conclusions to those of the present letter have been obtained elsewhere, either
by a careful study of clock synchronisation procedures [4, 5, 6, 7] or, without considering
clock synchronisation or using the Lorentz transformation, directly from the Reciprocity
Principle [8]. However, if observations of two clocks at rest in diﬀerent inertial frames
are performed, (C1’ and C2’ considered above are at rest in the same inertial frame) a
genuine relativity of simultaneity eﬀect is predicted by the Lorentz transformation [9, 10].
Also, if length intervals are speciﬁed, not by rulers at rest in some inertial frame, but
by distances between spatial coincidences of the same moving objects in diﬀerent inertial
frames, a genuine length contraction eﬀect, although quantitatively diﬀerent from that of
Eqn(14), as well as a frame dependence of the time interval between two such coincidence
events, which diﬀers from the TD relation (7), are predicted [11]. Thus both RS and LC
eﬀects do occur in special relativity, but not in the way suggested by Einstein.

To date, there is no experimental veriﬁcation of the RS or LC eﬀects of conventional
special relativity theory [4], which are claimed to be spurious in the present letter. How-
ever the existence (or not) of the O(v/c) RS eﬀect of Eqn(25) is easily tested using modern
experimental techniques. Two experiments, using satellites in low Earth orbit, have been
proposed to perform such a test [12]

1. – Introduction: Localized solutions to the wave equations

Since 1915 Bateman[1] showed that Maxwell equations admit (besides of the ordinary

planewave solutions, endowed in vacuum with speed c) of wavelet-type solutions, en-

dowed in vacuum with group-velocities 0 ≤ v ≤ c. But Bateman’s work went practically

unnoticed. Only few authors, as Barut et al.[2] followed such a research line; inciden-

tally, Barut et al. constructed even a wavelet-type solution travelling with Superluminal

group-velocity[3] v > c.

In recent times, however, many authors discussed the fact that all (homogeneous)

wave equations admit solutions with 0 < v < ∞:

see, e.g., Donnelly & Ziolkowski[4],

Esposito[4], Vaz & Rodrigues[4]. Most of those authors conﬁned themselves to investi-

gate (sub- or Super-luminal) localized non-dispersive solutions in vacuum: namely, those

solutions that were called “undistorted progressive waves” by Courant & Hilbert. Among

localized solutions, the most interesting appeared to be the so-called “X-shaped” waves,

which —predicted even by Special Relativity in its extended version[5]— had been mathe-

matically constructed by Lu & Greenleaf[6] for acoustic waves, and by Ziolkowski et al.[7],

and later Recami[8], for electromagnetism.

Let us recall that such “X-shaped” localized solutions are Superluminal (i.e., travel

with v > c in the vacuum) in the electromagnetic case; and are “super-sonic” (i.e., travel

with a speed larger than the sound-speed in the medium) in the acoustic case. The ﬁrst

authors to produce X-shaped waves experimentally were Lu & Greenleaf[9] for acoustics,

and Saari et al.[10] for optics.

Notwithstanding all that work, still it is not yet well understood what solutions (let

us now conﬁne ourselves to Maxwell equations and to electromagnetic waves) have to

enter into the play in many experiments.

2. – About evanescent waves

Most of the experimental results, actually, did not refer to the abovementioned local-

ized, sub- or Super-luminal, solutions, which in vacuum are expected to propagate rigidly

(or almost rigidly, when suitably truncated). The experiments most after fashion are, on

2

the contrary, those measuring the group-velocity of evanescent waves[cf., e.g., refs.11,12].

In fact, both Quantum Mechanics[13] and Special Relativity[5] had predicted tunnelling

wavepackets (tunnelling photons too) and/or evanescent waves to be Superluminal.

For instance, experiments[12] with evanescent waves travelling down an under-

sized waveguide revealed that evanescent modes are endowed with Superluminal group-

velocities[14].

A problem arises in connection with the experiment[15] with two “barriers” 1 and

2 (i.e., segments of undersized waveguide).

In fact, it has been found that for suitable

frequency bands the wave coming out from barrier 1 goes on with practically inﬁnite

speed, crossing the intermediate normal-sized waveguide 3 in zero time. Even if this

can be theoretically understood by looking at the relevant transfer function (see the

computer simulations, based on Maxwell equations only, in refs.[16,17]), it is natural to

wonder what are the solutions of Maxwell equations that can travel with Superluminal

speed in a normal waveguide (where one normally meets ordinary propagating —and not

evanescent— modes)...

Namely, the dispersion relation in undersized guides is ω2 − k2 = −Ω2, so that the

standard formula v ≃ dω/dk yields a v > c group-velocity[17,18]. However, in normal
guides the dispersion relation becomes ω2 − k2 = +Ω2, so that the same formula yields

values v < c only.

We are going to show that actually localized solutions to Maxwell equations propa-

gating with v > c do exist even in normal waveguides; but their group-velocity v cannot
be given#1 by the approximate formula v ≃ dω/dk. One of the main motivations of

the present note is just contributing to the clariﬁcation of this question.

3. – About some localized solutions to Maxwell equations.

Let us start by considering localized solutions to Maxwell equations in vacuum. A

theorem by Lu et al.[19] showed how to start from a solution holding in the plane (x, y)

for constructing a threedimensional solution rigidly moving along the z-axis with Super-

#1 Let us recall that the group-velocity is well deﬁned only when the pulse has a clear bump in space;
but it can be calculated by the approximate, elementary relation v ≃ dω/dk only when some extra
conditions are satisﬁed (namely, when ω as a function of k is also clearly bumped).

luminal velocity v. Namely, let us assume that ψ(ρ; t), with ρ ≡ (x, y), is a solution of

the 2-dimensional homogeneous wave equation:

x + ∂2

y − 1

c2 ∂2

(cid:16)∂2

t(cid:17) ψ(ρ; t) = 0 .

(1)

By applying the transformation ρ → ρ sin θ;

t → t − (cos θ/c) z,

the angle θ being

ﬁxed, with 0 < θ < π/2, one gets[19] that ψ(ρ sin θ; t − (cos θ/c) z) is a solution to the

threedimensional homogeneous wave-equation

(cid:16)∇2 − 1
c2 ∂2

t(cid:17) ψ(cid:18)ρ sin θ; t − cos θ

c

z(cid:19) = 0 .

(2)

The mentioned theorem holds for the vacuum case, and in general is not valid when

introducing boundary conditions. However we discovered that, in the case of a bidimen-

sional solution ψ valid on a circular domain of the (x, y) plane, such that ψ = 0 for |ρ| = 0,

the transformation above leads us to a (three-dimensional) localized solution rigidly trav-

elling with Superluminal speed v = c/ cos θ inside a cylindrical waveguide; even if the

waveguide radius r will be no longer a, but r = a/ sin θ > a. We can therefore obtain

an undistorted Superluminal solution propagating down cylindrical (metallic) waveguides

for each (2-dimensional) solution valid on a circular domain. Let us recall that, as well-

known, any solution to the scalar wave equation corresponds to solutions of the (vectorial)

Maxwell equations (cf., e.g., ref.[8] and refs. therein).

For simplicity, let us put the origin O at the center of the circular domain C, and

choose a 2-dimensional solution that be axially symmetric ψ(ρ; t), with ρ = |ρ|, and

with the initial conditions ψ(ρ; t = 0) = φ(ρ), and ∂ψ/∂t = ξ(ρ) at t = 0.

Notice that, because of the transformations

ρ =⇒ ρ sin θ

t =⇒ t −

cos θ

c

z ,

(3a)

(3b)

the more the initial ψ(ρ; t) is localized at t = 0, the more the (threedimensional) wave

ψ(ρ sin θ; t − (cos θ/c)z will be localized around z = vt.

It should be also emphasized

4

that, because of transformation (3b), the velocity c goes into the velocity v = c/cosθ > c.

Let us start with the formal choice

φ(ρ) =

δ(ρ)

ρ

;

ξ(ρ) ≡ 0 .

In cylindrical coordinates the wave equation (1) becomes

  1

ρ

∂ρρ∂ρ −

1
c2 ∂2

t! ψ(ρ; t) = 0 ,

(4)

(1’)

which exhibits the assumed axial symmetry. Looking for factorized solutions of the type
ψ(ρ; t) = R(ρ)·T (t), one gets the equations ∂2
ρ+ω2/c2)R = 0,

t T = −ω2T and (ρ−1∂ρ+∂2

where the “separation constant” ω is a real parameter, which yield the solutions

T = A cos ωt + B sin ωt

R = C J0(

ω
c

ρ) ,

(5)

where quantities A, B, C are real constants, and J0 is the ordinary zero-order Bessel

function (we disregarded the analogous solution Y0(ωρ/c) since it diverges for ρ = 0).
Finally, by imposing the boundary condition ψ = 0 at ρ = a, one arrives at the base

solutions

ψ(ρ; t) = J0(

kn
a

ρ) (An cos ωnt + Bn sin ωnt) ;

k ≡

ω
c

a ,

(6)

the roots of the Bessel function being

kn =

ωna

c

.

The general solution for our bidimensional problem (with our boundary conditions)

will therefore be the Fourier-type series

Ψ2D(ρ; t) = P∞

n=1 J0(

kn
a

ρ) (An cos ωnt + Bn sin ωnt) .

(7)

5

The initial conditions (4) imply that P AnJ0(knρ/a) = δ(ρ)/ρ, and P BnJ0(knρ/a) =

0, so that all Bn must vanish, while An = 2[a2J 2

1 (kn)]−1; and eventually one gets:

Ψ2D(ρ; t) = P∞

n=1 

2
a2J 2

1 (kn)! J0(

kn
a

ρ) cos ωnt .

(8) ,

where ωn = knc/a.

Let us explicitly notice that we can pass from such a formal solution to more physical

ones, just by considering a ﬁnite number N of terms. In fact, each partial expansion will

satisfy (besides the boundary condition) the second initial condition ∂tψ = 0 for t = 0,
while the ﬁrst initial condition gets the form φ(ρ) = f (ρ), where f (ρ) will be a (well)

localized function, but no longer a delta-type function. Actually, the “localization” of

φ(ρ) increases with increasing N. We shall come back to this point below.

4. – Localized waves propagating Superluminally down (normal-sized) waveg-

uides.

We have now to apply transformations (3) to solution (8),

in order to pass to

threedimensional waves propagating along a cylindrical (metallic) waveguide with radius

r = a/ sin θ. We obtain that Maxwell equations admit in such a case the solutions

Ψ3D(ρ, z; t) = P∞

n=1

(9)

where ωn = knc/a, which are sums over diﬀerent propagating modes.

Such solutions propagate, down the waveguide, rigidly with Superluminal velocity#2
v = c/cos θ. Therefore, (non-evanescent) solutions to Maxwell equations exist, that are

waves propagating undistorted along normal waveguides with Superluminal speed (even

if in normal-sized waveguides the dispersion relation for each mode, i.e. for each term of
the Fourier-Bessel expansion, is the ordinary “subluminal” one, ω2/c2 − k2

z = +Ω2).

It is interesting that our Superluminal solutions travel rigidly down the waveguide:

#2 Let us stress that each eq.(9) represents a multimodal (but localized) propagation, as if the geo-

metric dispersion compensated for the multimodal dispersion.

6

this is at variance with what happens for truncated (Superluminal) solutions[7-10], which

travel almost rigidly only along their ﬁnite “ﬁeld depth” and then abruptly decay.

Finally, let us consider a ﬁnite number of terms in eq.(8), at t = 0. We made a few

numerical evaluations: let us consider the results for N = 22 (however, similar results can

be already obtained, e.g., for N = 10). The ﬁrst initial condition of eq.(4), then, is no

longer a delta function, but results to be the (bumped) bidimensional wave represented

in Fig.1.

The threedimensional wave, eq.(9), corresponding to it, i.e., with the same ﬁnite

number N = 22 of terms, is depicted in Fig.2.

It is still an exact solution of the wave

equation, for a metallic (normal-sized) waveguide with radius r = a/ sin θ, propagating

rigidly with Superluminal group-velocity v = c/ cos θ; moreover, it is now a physical

solution.

In Fig.2 one can see its central portion, while in Fig.3 it is shown the space

proﬁle along z, for t = const., of such a propagating wave.

domain ρ ≤ a; a = 0.1 mm of the (x, y) plane, for t = 0, corresponding to the sum of

N = 22 terms in the expansion (8).

It is no longer a delta function, but it is still very

well peaked. By choosing it as the initial condition, instead of the ﬁrst one of eqs.(4), one

gets the threedimensional wave depicted in Figs.2 and 3. The normalization condition is
such that |Ψ2D(ρ = 0; t = 0)|2 = 1.

Fig.2 – The (very well localized) threedimensional wave corresponding to the initial,

bidimensional choice in Fig.1.

It propagates rigidly (along the normal-sized circular

waveguide with radius r = a/ sin θ) with Superluminal speed v = c/ cos θ. Quantity η is
deﬁned as η ≡ (z − c
cos θ t). The normalization condition is such that |Ψ3D(ρ = 0; η =
0)|2 = 1.

One of the outstanding problems of philosophy of science and mathemat-
ics today is whether there is just ”one” unique mathematics or the same
can be bifurcated into ”pure” and ”applied” categories. A novel solution for
this problem is oﬀered here. This will allow us to appreciate the manner in
which mathematics acts as an exact and precise language of nature. This
has signiﬁcant implications for Artiﬁcial Intelligence.

ABSTRACT

1

Human vocal cords are capable of producing a very large ( but not un-
limited ) number of sounds of varying range in wavelength and frequency.
As these sounds are to be distinguishable to the human ear, the number
of acceptable sounds in a particular language get still more limited. When
combined together into bunches, these provide a very large number of sound
options available for humans to communicate with. Every language however
chooses from amongst these large number of options to decide upon a few
acceptable ones. Thus a limited number of sound combinations are chosen in
a language to provide them with meaning and then the social group enforces
their usage.

Clearly to start with a child has several options. It starts to make various
sounds, experiments with them and relishes in them. But to survive and
to be able to communicate with others it learns that only a few sounds are
acceptable to the social group that it belongs to. So, if a child insists on
calling a cat a ”dog” and a dog a ”cat” it soon learns to use the proper
acceptable sound when it has to inform its parents as to whether it was a
dog or a cat that bit him. A ”rose” in English and ”gulab” in Hindi or Urdu
are diﬀerent words for the same object. But the associations they are meant
to convey are signiﬁcant in those languages. Sound and its association is an
arbitrary property of a particular language. Clearly cultural and sociological
factors determine as to how a particular language develops.

Note that within the periphery of a particular language a sound which
does not fall within the acceptable category is considered gibberish. For each
acceptable sound in a language there are clearly many more gibberish sounds.
Thus the range of gibberish sounds outside any language is much larger than
that of acceptable sounds in the language.

The above statements are supported by the following deﬁnitions of lan-
guage. Noam Chomsky deﬁnes it thus, ” A language is a set ( ﬁnite or inﬁnite
) of sentences each ﬁnite in length and constructed out of a ﬁnite set of ele-
ments” ( Chomsky(1957) ). Also as per Trager, ” A language is a system of
arbitrary vocal symbols by means of which the members of a society interact
in terms of their ” total culture ” ( Trager(1949) ).

Just as English is the language of residents of London and Hindi or Urdu
is of those residing in Delhi, mathematics is the language of scientists. And
as the scientists when using mathematics are communicating about nature,
mathematics turns out to be the language of nature.

The fact that mathematics is the language of nature has been known to

2

scientists for a long time. For example Galileo Galilie had said ( Galileo
(1616) ), ” Philosophy ( ie physics) is written in this grand book - I mean
the universe - which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be
understood unless one ﬁrst learns to comprehend the language and interpret
the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathe-
matics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical ﬁgures,
without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it;
without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth”.

Bertrand Russell ( Russell (1931) ) said, ”Ordinary language is totally un-
suited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday
life are not suﬃciently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic
can say as little as the physicist means to say”. James Jeans enthusiastically
stated ( Jeans (1930) ), ”God is a mathematician”. And work to show that
indeed mathematics is the language of nature has been actively pursued (
Redhead (1975), Alan and Peat(1988), French (1999), Omnes (2005) ).

It is clear that just about all the scientists and most of the philosophers
would feel that mathematics is indeed the language of nature. However
the mathematics that is usable as a language of nature is called ”applied
mathematics”. Inherent in this word ”applied” is the fact that there is a lot of
mathematics which is not applied. This is the so called ”pure” mathematics.
That is, mathematics which has found no application in a description of
nature. It acts outside any physical framework - a pure construct of human
intellect as many a mathematician would have us believe.
In fact, it is a
dream of every mathematician to discover/invent a mathematics which can
be labelled as ”pure” - that is uncorrupted by any ”lowly” application to the
real world. There must be a thrill in creating something that is absolutely
independent of any existing thing/concept/idea. Hardy boasted ( Hardy
(1940) ), ” I have never done anything ’ useful ’. No discovery of mine has
made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least
diﬀerence to the amenity of the world. ”

So clearly - though mathematics may be the language of nature ( ie. the
”applied” part ), most of it is not ( ie the ”pure” part ). What is that mathe-
matics ? It seems to have a Platonic world of its own. The logical positivists (
Carnap ( 1995 Edition ) ) tried to understand this dichotomy by arguing that
knowledge has two sources - the logical reasoning and the empirical experi-
ence. According to them logical reasoning shall lead to the analytical a priori
knowledge. That would embrace the ﬁeld of pure mathematics. While the

3

empirical experience would lead to the synthetic a posteriori knowledge and
this would correspond to the applied mathematics. Explicitly or implicitly
such a ”dichotomous” point of view of the intrinsic structure of mathematics
is held by most scientists, mathematicians and philosophers today. However,
if indeed mathematics is the language of nature, then how come there is a
smaller reservoir of language which nature communicates with ( ie applied
mathematics ) but there is a larger reservoir of unused language ( ie pure
mathematics )? How and why does this unused language ( ” pure mathemat-
ics ” ) come into existence? No one has any reasonable understanding of it
at present. This is an extremely unsatisfactory state of aﬀairs and demands
further inquiry. Though not often explicitly stated, this problem remains
today as one of the most outstanding open issues in science/mathematics
and its philosophy.

If anyone has doubts as to the seriousness of the issue, one need only read
Reuben Hersh ( Hersh (2005) ). Therein he was reviewing Ronald Omnes’
new book on philosophy of physics and mathematics (Omnes (2005)). He
quotes Omnes, ” The consistency of mathematics is therefore tantamount
to the existence of mathematically expressible laws of nature.” Thereafter
Hersh goes on to say bitterly, ” Minor glitches can be shrugged oﬀ.
( A
few oddball branches of math like higher set theory and nonstandard logics
may not be physical, but who cares? ) ”. If this is how leading authorities
feel about the issue, then what could be more urgent? Hersh further quotes
Omnes, ” What exactly is the extent of the present mathematical corpus
that is in relation to the mathematics of physics? I cannot say that I have
analyzed this question carefully, but I considered it from time to time when
reading papers in theoretical physics and mathematics ”. Hence clearly up
to now, no philosopher or mathematician or scientist has understood what
mathematics ” really ” is. Here I oﬀer a novel solution to the conundrum.

Just as a child discovers the ”correct” words to use for speciﬁc objects or
ideas through social interactions, similarly a scientist learns the appropriate
word for a particular physical reality by interacting with nature. However,
while the word ”rose” for a particular ﬂower is culture determined and varies
from language to language, the mathematical word for a particular physical
object is exact and speciﬁc. It turns out that nature is very demanding and
requires strict adherence to clear-cut mathematical rules to reveal its reality
to scientists. Only through a tortuous and painstaking process of basically
hit and trial method along with some judicious guesswork is it that a scientist

4

discovers the ” correct ” mathematical word or expression for a particular
physical object or phenomena.

So basically, a priori, to a scientist there would exist a large number
of mathematical options/words to accurately describe a particular physical
phenomenon. One tries all. There is bound to be a stage where confusion
reigns. That would be the initial stage wherein more than one mathemat-
ical model or terminology may appear to be applicable. History of science
tells us that slowly with time and much eﬀort, the physical reality will man-
ifest itself by demanding and forcing upon scientists only one particular and
unique mathematical structure. That will be the stage that the scientist
would have discovered the ”exact” word/phrase for that particular physical
object/phenomena. No ambiguity about that ( more on it below ). Thus
nature has allowed the scientist to read that particular ”word”.

The whole purpose of science is to continue to read nature through this
”exact” mathematical language. Acquiring a larger vocabulary of this math-
ematical language leads to a greater ﬂuency with nature.

Sometimes scientists would have to develop ab initio the necessary mathe-
matics to understand physical reality. For example, to understand the empir-
ically determined Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, Newton had to develop
the requisite calculus to do so. The very fact that Newton was actually able
to acquire the necessary mathematical vocabulary made it possible for him
to appreciate the eﬀects of gravity. The physical ’book’ of gravity was ’read’
only because the necessary mathematics could be simultaneously developed.
It was to ’read’ the other physical eﬀects as well, that Newton’s contem-
porary, Leibniz was independently developing the required mathematics of
calculus. Hence the requisite mathematical language of calculus was basic
and essential to an understanding of gravity and dynamics in physical nature.
Simply put, had it not been possible to develop the language of calculus, one
would not have been able to read nature any better.

The basic mathematics of calculus could be developed by scientists them-
selves ( ie. Newton and Leibniz ) as fortunately it did not necessarily require
a too sophisticated pre-existing mathematical framework. Their work was
simpliﬁed by the fact that the foundations of calculus had already been laid
by earlier mathematicians.
It was not just for nothing that Newton had
stated that he had risen on the shoulders of giants.

As there appears to be some confusion in the minds of many as to the
issue of priority here, may I quote Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins

5

on this matter ( Courant and Robbins (1996) p. 398 ), ” With an absurd
oversimpliﬁcation, the ”invention” of calculus is sometimes ascribed to two
men, Newton and Leibniz. In reality, calculus is the product of a long evolu-
tion that was neither initiated nor terminated by Newton and Leibniz, but
in which they played a decisive part.”

Very often development in science is hampered if the adequate and appro-
priate mathematical framework does not exist. Therefore, had the algebra of
tensors not been developed by Einstein’s contemporary mathematicians, he
would never have been able to give his equation of motion in General Theory
of Relativity in 1915. This equation gives the force of gravity as an entirely
pure geometry on the left hand side of the equation while all the other forces -
strong, weak and electromagnetic which describe all the matter particles and
radiation, sit on the right hand side of the equation. This may be called the
Ultimate Equation relating space, time and matter. This extremely beautiful
and revealing equation describing nature could not have been ’read’ but for
the fortuitous contemporary development of tensor algebra.

However, note that if the ideas presented here are correct ie mathematics
is indeed the language of nature, then this would allow ”anyone” ( who is
suﬃciently prepared ) to read it. And indeed in the case of the General
Theory of Relativity the German mathematician A. Hilbert simultaneous to
Einstein, had ”read” the same equation. This is being revealed as further
facts about the General Theory of Relativity are coming to light in recent
years. This is in contrast to the earlier popular opinion that the General
Theory of Relativity was the mysterious creation of Einstein and none other.
That is, as per this opinion, had Einstein not been born there would have
been no General Theory of Relativity today. Misreading of history can indeed
make one appear like a blind person groping in a maze. ( This groping would
be in addition to what all scientists/mathematicians/philosophers have to
do anyway as part of their work to understand and read nature - quite a
demanding and challenging job in itself!
). That view was at complete
variance with the fact that correct mathematics is indeed the language of
nature and practically anyone ( proviso suﬃcient mathematical and scientiﬁc
background is there ) can ”read” it!

As an attestation to the fact that mathematics is the language of nature,
history of science is replete with examples where more than one scientist,
’read’ the same language independently. The above example of Newton vs
Leibniz and Einstein vs Hilbert are but two such cases.

When the quark model of particle/high energy physics was being devel-
oped to understand the structure of the umpteen number of particles being
discovered experimentally in the 1950’s and 1960’s, a priori there were sev-
eral group theoretical mathematical candidates for a scientiﬁc description of
reality : the groups G2, F2, SU(2)xU(1) and SU(3) were good candidates for
it. It was basically through the method of hit and trial that it was found
that SU(3) group was the correct candidate for such a description. It was
found that to understand the structure of particles like proton, neutron etc
it was necessary to assume that they were made up of three kind of quarks
which were named as up, down and strange ( in the accepted nomenclature
at present ). As such nature ’forced’ the scientists to read the word ”SU(3)”
in the quark model. Plainly stated they found that no other mathematical
’word’ can do the job appropriately!

It maybe noted here that two scientists, Murray Gell-Mann and G. Zweig,
independently and practically simultaneously, had come to the same conclu-
sion that indeed SU(3) was the relevant group as discussed above. So to say,
they both had been able to ”read” nature correctly. Hence this is another
example, in addition to the cases of Newton/Leibniz and Einstein/Hilbert as
pointed out above, where proper mathematics, being the language of nature,
allows itself to be ”read” by more than one person at the same time.

Another example from particle/high energy physics is that of Quantum
Chromodynamics, the theory of the strong interaction.
In the 1970’s and
1980’s a priori several groups SU(2), U(2), SO(3) and SU(3) were reasonable
candidates as the group theoretical/mathematical ’words’ to describe strong
interaction consistently. But experimental information and mathematical
consistency forced the group SU(3) as the relevant group for the theory of
the strong interaction to be built upon. It has been meticulously checked and
found that SU(3) and none other is the right ”word” for Quantum Chromo-
dynamics or the theory of strong interaction. No scientist could have even
in his wildest dreams ever thought of such a scenario right up to the 1960’s.
So also is the example of the so called the Standard Model of particle
physics which is built around the group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1). This is the most
successful model in particle physics as of now. This mathematical structure
or word is the result of judicious speculation, meticulous experimentation
and sheer hard work on the part of scientists all over the world during the
last 100 years or so. It is important to realize that no other mathematical
description can do what the Standard Model can do. Not that scientists did

7

not try other ”words”. They did - in fact they tried very hard indeed. But
they always failed and were forced to accept the above group.

Another proof that indeed mathematics is the correct language of nature
is the following. It also turns out that often a particular ’word’ in mathe-
matics is used for more than one physical situations. For example the group
SU(2) as a mathematical language can describe the so called ’spin’ degree
of freedom and other independent ’isospin’ or ’nusospin’ degrees of freedom
in physics ( Abbas(2005) ). Words/sounds do have independent existence.
We give them a particular meaning by association. We match/map them to
whatever physical object/concept we wish. For example I may call a nectar
’honey’ and use the same word for my wife. As far as I am concerned the
same word ’honey’ is accurately describing/mapping the reality of nectar as
well as my wife. Thus in the mathematical description of nature the group
SU(2) can stand as the ”word’ for diﬀerent physical entities like spin, isospin
and nusospin. Also as we described a little earlier the group SU(3) stood
for quarks in the quark model as well as for another independent framework
of describing the strong interaction as the gauge force built up around this
group - the so called Quantum Chromodynamics. This is a further proof
that mathematics correctly read ( the SU(2) or SU(3) groups here ) is indeed
the language of nature.

Well, good enough. However, this must be true for all that part of math-
ematics which can be labelled as ”applied”. But this constitutes only a small
part of the whole mathematical ediﬁce that exists today. What about the
huge amount of ”pure” mathematics. On the basis of what has been stated
so far, ”pure” mathematics should therefore be understood so as to belong
to the honourable category of ”gibberish”. No oﬀense meant, but as far
as the language of nature is concerned, if the relevant applied mathematics
is the exact and accurate vocabulary of nature, then necessarily the ’pure’
mathematics must be treated as ’gibberish’ in the framework of what one
understands as a ”language”.

Just as a child can produce a large number of gibberish sounds in ordi-
nary language so can a mathematician produce a huge amount of ’gibberish’
mathematics. Just as the structure of the physical reality allows us to pro-
duce a large amount of gibberish sounds so also the mathematical reality of
nature seems to be structured in a manner that it allows us to conceive of
a huge amount of mathematical ”gibberish”. But the history of science is
full of instances of mathematics which was considered as ’pure”, as what the

8

discoverers of the same would have us believe, and which later turned out
to be extremely valuable in physical applications. For example as to Hardy
( who as we stated earlier was proud of the purity of his mathematics ) it
turned out that some of his work on inﬁnite series in number theory today
ﬁnds deep applications in cryptography/communication theory etc. When
discovered, the mathematical matrices were thought to be beyond any ap-
plications in nature. Today, these form the bread and butter of quantum
physicists. Hence what may be a mathematical ”gibberish” today may turn
out to attain the status of a proper and correct word in the language to
describe nature as relevant ”applied” mathematics.

If ”all” of mathematics can be used to explain one or the other aspect of
nature, then there would be no ”gibberish” mathematics left. That would
mean that whatever human mind is capable of producing in mathematics
just can not go beyond some application or the other to nature. It is hard
to say at this stage whether this is correct. Further work has to be done to
see if this be indeed so. At this stage though, it appears that there is indeed
a huge amount of mathematics which ﬁnds no application in the description
or understanding of nature.

It should also be obvious that the way scientists learn to read the book of
nature, this should be independent of any cultural, sociological, historical and
personal bias. The mathematical - physical reality lies beyond our physical
and existential limitations. The example of S. Ramanujan, S N Bose et al
would clearly show that this is indeed so. Coming from completely diﬀerent
social and cultural background, these scientists/mathematicians were still
able to read the book of nature in its exact mathematical formulation. In
addition what they read could also be read by all the other scientists correctly.
And as such, it must be that the mathematical mapping of physical reality,
if done in the proper manner, is accurate and exact.

Amongst those who believe that mathematics is the language of nature
there is still another issue of misunderstanding - and that is the issue of em-
bedding. It is commonly believed that ” as mathematics is more fundamental
and larger in content, physics/science should be embedded in mathematics ”.
For example ( French (1999) ),” The relationship between mathematics and
science is clearly of fundamental concern in both the philosophy of mathe-
matics and the philosophy of science .... One possibility is to employ a model
- theoretic framework in which ”physical structures” are regarded as embed-
ded in ”mathematical ones” ”. Continuing in the same strain, ( Redlich

9

(1975) ), ” it is an ”empirical - historical fact” that theories in physics can
be represented as mathematical structures ”. Similar view is also expressed
by Omnes ( Omnes (2005) ), ” When a physical theory .. requires mathe-
matics in the formalized corpus .. one can make the axioms necessary for the
theory explicit, at least in principle, and follow the unfolding of ideas from
these axioms into the mathematical corpus.”

As per this view, mathematics forms a basic and fundamental structure
and physics arises as a later structure which tries to gain legitimacy by em-
bedding itself in this already preexisting structure. But this model leads to
several interpretational problems. This is necessarily artiﬁcial in content as
clearly this model is completely at variance with what has been presented by
us above. As per what we are saying here, in fact it is actually physics which
maps the primitive and basic reality of nature and in as much as mathematics
is the language of nature, it continues to ’read’ this book of nature. There is
no question of embedding here.

Many persons ( Russell (1931), Jeans (1930), Alan and Peat (1988), Red-
head (1972), Shapiro (1977), French (1999), Omnes (2005) ), including this
author, have talked of mathematics as being the language of science or na-
ture. If this is so, then the ability to handle mathematics should be linked
to the ability to handle ordinary language grammar. However in a recent
study Rosemary Varley et al (2005) studied three men with brain damage
which aﬀected their ability to handle grammar. However Varley et al found
that these men retained full ability to do computations including recursion.
They could even deal with structure - dependent concepts such as mathe-
matical expressions with brackets etc. This clearly shows that the ability
to handle the language of mathematics is entirely independent of one’s abil-
ity to handle ordinary language. Thus though both ( human languages say
English/Hindi/Urdu and mathematics ) are languages, these are essentially
diﬀerent in as much as they register diﬀerently in human brain. This diﬀer-
ence should be basic rather than accidental.

Hence scientists, when making up theories have to ﬁnd judicious combi-
nations of these disparate aspects of the two languages to communicate with
each other. So no wonder experts in one or the other of these two ’languages’
miss appreciation of the total reality. Clearly this supports our contention
here, as that of mathematics being the ’exact’ language of nature.

As we have shown above, there are actually two independent ”languages”.
Firstly the everyday language ( like English, Hindi and Urdu ) and secondly

10

the language of mathematics. The ﬁrst one is imprecise and fuzzy while the
other one is precise and exact. It would have been rather puzzling if these
two were to register and be controlled by the same area of the brain and in
the same manner. Because then it would have been hard to understand as to
how the same area of the brain could produce imprecise and fuzzy language
at the same time that it was producing another independent language which
It shows consistency of the ideas presented here
was precise and exact.
that Varley et al found that indeed the two languages arise intrinsically in a
diﬀerent manner within the human brain.

If these two modes of languages register diﬀerently in the human brain,
then it is possible that they arose at diﬀerent periods of time during human
evolution, due to diﬀerent requirements of adaptation needed for them to be-
come essential for survival. The ﬁrst, the spoken language, arose as a result
of social interaction and as a result of demands of survival for food etc. While
the second, the language of mathematics, arose as a result of man’s inter-
action with nature. As man spends more time with nature than with other
human beings, the second language must be more naturally acquired than
the ﬁrst one. This point is also supported by the fact that other creatures
have been interacting with nature for a longer period of time than what we
humans have been doing. Do they have a language of mathematics? Indeed
they do. When a bird needing to feed two chicks in its nest, actually brings
back two insects to feed them, then indeed it has acquired the rudiments
of mathematics. Hence it is clear that humans in the course of evolution
must have learnt elements of the language of nature well before they learnt
to speak. Therefore, it may come as a surprise to some, but mathematics
as a language of nature, albeit in a more elementary form, must have been
available to species other than homo sapiens. Indeed current research shows
that acquisition of spoken language may be a much later development in
human evolution. In fact, the growth of the human brain and the faculty of
(spoken) language acquisition may have been simultaneous ( Deacon (1992)
).

”Mistakes” are an inherent part of mathematics. Do these mistakes oc-
cur accidentally or are they basic to mathematics itself? Rene Descartes
thought mistakes by mathematics were inadvertent. Charles Peirce thought
that these were due to lapse of memory. Ludwig Wittgenstein stated that ac-
tually mathematics was a subject in which it was possible to make mistakes.
In fact in mathematics it is impossible not to make mistakes. Riemann used

11

what he called ”Dirichlet’s Principle” incorrectly. Hilbert incorrectly thought
that he had proven the Continuum Hypothesis. There are umpteen exam-
ples. These are only for such recorded and well known written cases. But
when an individual scientist/mathematician, during his private moments, in
trying to go beyond known mathematics, keeps on making mistakes. He
struggles through a maze of mistakes and then arrives at whatever he thinks
is consistent mathematics and is ”publishable”. Only these are what we hear
of and what one talks of. These private mistakes should also be considered
”mistakes” in mathematics. These are too innumerable and are often well
kept secrets ( as never uttered ) to be recorded here!

Just as a child when speaking a language tries to experiment with sounds
and names, it discovers new sounds ( gibberish ) and in fact enjoys doing it.
That gibberish would be proven to be a ”mistake” due to social pressures and
ultimately abandoned by the child. But clearly such mistakes are part of the
very process of speech learning. So also are mistakes in mathematics. As na-
ture is very demanding and requires strict adherence to its ”intrinsic” mathe-
matics so even gibberish mathematics would have rules of consistency. Hence
though mistakes would be made these would be subsequently corrected. In
fact mistakes would be an inevitable part of discovering new mathematics.
This analogy too shows that indeed mathematics is a ”language” ( of nature
).

A thought, on as to how two diﬀerent mathematics - pure and applied
arise.
In everyday language I am free to visualize objects which are half
man - half woman or part horse - part dog - part snake or part cow - part
human - part bird - part elephant etc. I can visualize groups of these as co-
existing with humans. In such cases my imagination allows me to cook up all
kind of ”realities” and thus think that I am able to visualize that these may
have some kind of existence in a Platonic world of its own. However quite
clearly we should call all these objects and their interactions etc as nothing
but gibberish, in as much as we know that these do not correspond to any
realistic objects. However it may be that in spite of being unaware of geology
and palaentology, that on observing a lizard at close quarters. I may be able
to imagine of a time when earth may have had extremely large and dangerous
lizards living on it. That hypothesis may later on be actually proven to be
correct by palaentologists as those creatures having been dinosaurs. So there
is a small, though non-zero chance that some of my gibberish imaginings may
turn out to reﬂect some aspect of reality in future.

12

In the same manner, mathematics being a precise and exact language of
nature - may allow us to cook up new ”realities”. Imagine new mathematics
- which is part this and part that, leave an axiom here, add a lemma there,
bring in some geometry and add some algebra etc. Do I have a consistent
mathematical framework? I may make mistakes as discussed above, but
then these would be corrected in due course of time. However, the fact that
the known mathematics on the basis of which I am trying to go beyond,
does have consistency, hence my new mathematics should have consistency
too. If not then we abandon it. Since diﬀerent known mathematical sub-
disciplines are related to each other, hence this new mathematics may have
similar consistency and inter-relationships. I may call my new structure as
”pure” mathematics. However, this would be ”gibberish” mathematics as we
discussed earlier. It is nevertheless possible that in future the same structure
may ﬁnd applications in the description of nature. Hence the Platonic world
of mathematics would be no more real than the Platonic world we discussed
in the social context above.

Phonologists have shown that phonemes in individual language families
are quite diﬀerent. This is so because as we grow up we acquire certain
pronunciation habits that are determined by the sound patterns permitted
in a particular language ( Hjelmslev (1970) ).

An anecdote would not be out of order. A British Scientist was in Japan
to attend an International Conference. During a session, a young Japanese
student gave a presentation of his work. The transparencies were written in
English. After the oral presentation, a senior Japanese scientist, sitting next
to him, turned to him and said, ” He is working under me. What do you
think of the work?”. The British replied. ” I don’t really know. I would
have understood it better had he spoken in English.” To which the Senior
Japanese replied, ” But he was speaking in English ! ”.

So though a written language may be ”read” by anyone in principle,
the spoken language demands proper pronunciation which too identiﬁes a
language. As Roman Jakobson has said ( Jakobson and Halle ( 1956 ) ),

” As regards the combination of linguistic elements there exists an increas-
ing degree of freedom. But when dealing with the combination of distinctive
features to phonemes. freedom does not exist for the individual speaker - the
code has already established all the possibilities that can be realized in the
given language. ”

As we have stated here, in terms of the appropriate applied mathematics,

13

we are learning the proper words in the language of nature, But as per above,
how do we ” pronounce ” it? As we saw from the anecdote, proper pronun-
ciation or lack thereof can provide or destroy universality in a language. If
indeed proper mathematics is the language of nature then its ” pronunciation
” should be universal and exact too.

But what would one identify as ” pronunciation ” in mathematics? Here
I would like to present an hypothesis as to what should be taken as ” pro-
nunciation ” when communicating in the language of nature.

Group theory of mathematics has been extensively applied in physics. It
it used to classify particles and in fact by a mathematical process called ”
gauging ” these actually even deﬁne forces between particles. A priori there
are several groups as candidates to be used to describe a particular physical
phenomenon. These are for example: inﬁnite series of groups SO(n), SU(n)
and Sp(n) ( for any n= 1,2,3,4,5, .... to inﬁnity ) and G2, F4. E6, E8 etc.
So why was it that in the 1960’s scientists discovered that to give proper
description of reality of particles only the group SU(3) with three quarks la-
belled up, down and strange was the ”correct” procedure? Why was it that
it was the group combination SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) that was found to be
necessary in the successful Standard Model of particle physics. I propose here
that a priori all these groups were options for ”sound production” to provide
diﬀerent ”pronunciations” for that particular ”word” in the language of na-
ture. Nature being precise and exact chose the ”pronunciation” as ”SU(3)”
for the quark model discussed above. And similarly it is the sound pronunci-
ation which is ﬁxed in SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1). Hence as per the suggestion here
the exactness in the group representation is precise and exact ﬁxing of the
sound pronunciation by nature so that unlike the spoken language, there is
no ambiguity in mathematics.

Particles have ﬁxed quantum numbers which are used to identify them.
For example lepton numbers for electron and neutrino, baryon number for
quarks, protons and charge number for electron, protons etc. What is the
nature of these quantum numbers? In terms of what has been stated above
this is just to ﬁx the pronunciation to describe and identify the diﬀerent
”races”/classes in the ”genealogy”/classiﬁcation of matter in nature.

Scientists have also discovered that it is an empirical fact that the law of
gravity and that of electromagnetic forces is inverse square of distance and
not any other, say a cubic or a fraction or any other power of distance. This
too, in view of what has been stated above, should be understood as a precise

reading of the language of nature. What the corresponding ”words” imply
and how these should be interpreted in the context of a language is an open
issue and calls for work in future.

Within the ﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence, it is important to know as to
how humans actually acquire knowledge, which is so intrinsically related
to language. Clearly the fact that the spoken human language is basically
diﬀerent from the language of nature ( mathematics ), should be a signiﬁcant
fact for AI scientists. Language is more complex than what was thought of
so far. Hence we have to redeﬁne what we mean by intelligence in the ﬁrst
place. This prompts for further work.

In summing up, mathematics is a precise and exact language. As such
most of the sounds/words in it are gibberish ( pure mathematics ) and the
rest are relevant and useful sounds ( applied mathematics ) which maps
In the explanation presented

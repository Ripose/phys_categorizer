Abstract

Early string theory described Bosonic particles at the real life
Compton scale. Later developments to include Fermions initiated by
Ramond and others have lead through Quantum Super Strings to
M-theory operating at the as yet experimentally unattainable Planck
scale. We describe an alternative route from Bosonic Strings to Fermions,
by directly invoking a non commutative geometry, an approach which
is closer to experiment.

1 Bosonic Strings

Let us begin with T. Regg’s work of the 1950s [1, 2, 3] in which he carried out a
complexiﬁcation of the angular momentum and analysed particle resonances.
As is well known, the resonances could be ﬁtted by a straight line plot in the
(J, M 2) plane, where J denotes the angular momentum and M the mass of
the resonances. That is we have

M 2,

J

∝

(1)

Equation (1) suggested that not only did resonances have angular momen-
tum, but they also resembled extended objects. This was contrary to the
belief that elementary particles were point like. In fact at the turn of the
twentieth century, Poincare, Lorentz, Abraham and others had toyed with
the idea that the electron had a ﬁnite extension, but they had to abandon
this approach, because of a conﬂict with Special Relativity. The problem

1

is that if there is a ﬁnite extension for the electron then forces on diﬀerent
parts of the electron would exhibit a time lag, requiring the so called Poincare
stresses for stability [4, 5, 6].
In this context, it may be mentioned that in the early 1960s, Dirac came up
with an imaginative picture of the electron, not so much as a point particle,
but rather a tiny closed membrane or bubble. Further, the higher energy
level oscillations of this membrane would represent the “heavier electrons”
like muons [7].
Then, in 1968, G. Veneziano came up with a uniﬁed description of the Regge
resonances (1) and other scattering processes. Veneziano considered the col-
lision and scattering process as a black box and pointed out that there were
in essence, two scattering channels, s and t channels. These, he argued gave
a dual description of the same process [8, 9].
In an s channel, particles A and B collide, form a resonance which quickly
disintegrates into particles C and D. On the other hand in a t channel scat-
tering particles A and B approach each other, and interact via the exchange
of a particle q. The result of the interaction is that particles C and D emerge.
If we now enclose the resonance and the exchange particle q in an imaginary
black box, it will be seen that the s and t channels describe the same input
and the same output: They are essentially the same.
There is another interesting hint which we get from Quantum Chromo Dy-
namics. Let us come to the inter-quark potential [10, 11]. There are two
interesting features of this potential. The ﬁrst is that of conﬁnement, which
is given by a potential term like

V (r)

σr,

r

≈

,

→ ∞

where σ is a constant. This describes the large distance behavior between two
quarks. The conﬁning potential ensures that quarks do not break out of their
bound state, which means that eﬀectively free quarks cannot be observed.
The second interesting feature is asymptotic freedom. This is realized by a
Coulumbic potential

The constant σ is called the string tension, because there are string models
which yield V (r). This is because, at large distances the inter-quark ﬁeld is

Such considerations lead to strings which are governed by the equation [12,

T being the tension of the string, l its length and ρ the line density and ω in
(3) the frequency. The identiﬁcation (3),(4) gives (5), where c is the velocity
of light, and (2) then goes over to the usual d’Alembertian or massless Klein-
Gordon equation.
Further, if the above string is quantized canonically, we get

i ∼
Thus the string can be considered as an inﬁnite collection of harmonic os-
cillators [13]. Further we can see, using equations (3) and (4) and the fact
that

¯hω = mc2

that the extension l is of the order of the Compton wavelength in (6), a
circumstance that was called one of the miracles of the string theory by
Veneziano [8].
It must be mentioned that the above considerations describe a “Bosonic
String”, in the sense that there is no room for the Quantum Mechanical
spin. This can be achieved by giving a rotation to the relativistic quantized
string as was done by Ramond [16, 17]. In this case we recover (1) of the
Regge trajectories. The particle is now an extended object, at the Compton
scale, rotating with the velocity of light. Furthermore in superstring theory
there is an additional term a0, viz.,

(2πT )−1M 2 + a0¯h, with a0 = +1(+2) for

the open (closed) string.

J

The term a0 in (7) comes from the Zero Point Energy. Usual gauge bosons
are described by a0 = 1 and gravitons by a0 = 2.
It is also well known that string theory has always had to deal with extra
dimensions which reduce to the usual four dimensions of physical spacetime
when we invoke the Kaluza-Klein approach at the Planck Scale [18].
All these considerations have been leading to more and more complex models,
the latest version being the so called M-Theory. In this latest theory super-
symmetry is broken so that the supersymmetric partner particles do not have
the same mass as the known particle. Particles can now be described as soli-
ton like branes, resembling the earlier Dirac membrane. M-Theory also gives
an interface with Black Hole Physics. Further these new masses must be
much too heavy to be detected by current accelerators. The advantage of
Supersymmetry is that a framework is now available for the uniﬁcation of
all the interactions including gravitation. It may be mentioned that under
a SUSY transformation, the laws of physics are the same for all observers,
which is the case in General Relativity (Gravitation) also. Under SUSY there
can be a maximum of eleven dimensions, the extra dimensions being curled
up as in Kaluza-Klein theories. In this case there can only be an integral
number of waves around the circle, giving rise to particles with quantized
energy. However for observers in the other four dimensions, it would be
quantized charges, not energies. The unit of charge would depend on the
radius of the circle, the Planck radius yielding the value e. This is the root
of the uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and gravitation in these theories.
In M-Theory, the position coordinates become matrices and this leads to, as
we will see, a noncommutative geometry or fuzzy spacetime in which space-
time points are no longer well deﬁned [19]

From this point of view the mysterious M in M-Theory could stand for
Matrix, rather than Membrane.
So M-Theory is the new avatar of QSS. Nevertheless it is still far from being
the last word. There are still any number of routes for compressing ten
dimensions to our four dimensions. There is still no contact with experiment.
It also appears that these theories lead to an unacceptably high cosmological
constant and so on.
The non-veriﬁability of the above considerations and the fact that the Planck
1020GeV is also beyond forseeable attainment in collidors has lead
scale

to much criticism even though it is generally accepted that the ideas are
promising.

2 Fuzzy Spacetime and Fermions

With the above background, we now attempt to use Bosonic Strings which
are at the real world Compton scale to obtain a description of Fermions
without going to the Planck scale. We saw above that Bosonic particles could
be described as extended objects at the Compton scale. Given a minimum
spacetime scale a, it was shown long ago by Snyder that,

[x, y] = (ıa2/¯h)Lz, [t, x] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mx, etc.

[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2

x];

(8)

It may be mentioned that (8) is compatible with Special Relativity. Fur-
thermore if a2 in (8) is neglected, then we get back the usual canonical
commutation relations of Quantum Mechanics. This limit to an established
theory is another attractive feature of (8).
However if order of a2 is retained then the ﬁrst of equations (8) characterize a
completely diﬀerent spacetime geometry, one in which the coordinates do not
commute. This is a noncommutative geometry and indicates that spacetime
within the scale deﬁned by a is ill deﬁned, or is fuzzy [19]. As we started
with a minimum extention at the Compton scale, let us take a = (l, τ ).
Then the above conclusion is in fact true, because as discussed in detail
[20, 21], by virtue of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, there are un-
physical superluminal eﬀects within this scale. In fact there is a non zero
probability for a particle at (~r1, t1) to be found at (~r2, t2), whatever be t1 and
t2, as long as

Another way of seeing this is by starting from the usual Dirac coordinate [22]

the σ’s being the usual Pauli matrices. The ﬁrst term on the right side of (9)
is the usual Hermitian position coordinate. It is the second or imaginary term
which contains ~α that makes the Dirac coordinate non Hermitian. However
we can easily verify from the commutation relations of ~α, using (10) that

l2

(11)

[xı, xj] = βıj ·
In fact (11) is just a form of the ﬁrst of equations (8) and brings out the
fuzzyness of spacetime in intervals where order of l2 is not neglected.
Dirac himself noticed this feature of his coordinate and argued [22] that our
physical spacetime is actually one in which averages at the Compton scale
are taken. Eﬀectively he realized that point spacetime is not physical. Once
such averages are taken, he pointed out that the rapidly oscillating second
term in (9) or zitterbewegung gets eliminated.
We now obtain a rationale for the Dirac equation and spin from (11) [23, 24].
Under a time elapse transformation of the wave function, (or, alternatively,
as a small scale transformation),

we get

ψ′(xj) = [1 + ıǫ(ıxj

) + 0(ǫ2)]ψ(xj)

∂xj

Equation (13) has been shown to lead to the Dirac equation when ǫ is the
Compton time. A quick way to see this is as follows: At the Compton scale
we have,

that is, we get the Quantum Mechanical spin. Next, we can easily verify,

provides a representation for the coordinates in (3), apart from scalar fac-
tors. As can be seen, this is also a representation of the Dirac matrices.
Substitution of the above in (13) leads to the Dirac equation

(12)

because

where ǫ = τ (Cf.ref.[25]).
Indeed, as noted, Dirac himself had realized that his electron equation needed
an average over spacetime intervals of the order of the Compton scale to
remove zitterbewegung eﬀects and give meaningful physics. This again is
symptomatic of an underlying fuzzy spacetime described by a noncommuta-
tive space time geometry (11) or (4) [26].
The point here is that under equation (11) and (14), the coordinates xµ
→
γ(µ)x(µ) where the brackets with the superscript denote the fact that there is
no summation over the indices. Infact, in the theory of the Dirac equation
it is well known [27]that,

where γ’s satisfy the usual Cliﬀord algebra of the Dirac matrices, and can be
represented by

(15)

(16)

where σ’s are the Pauli matrices. As noted by Bade and Jehle (Cf.ref.[27]), we
could take the σ’s or γ’s in (16) and (15) as the components of a contravariant
world vector, or equivalently we could take them to be ﬁxed matrices, and
to maintain covariance, to attribute new transformation properties to the
wave function, which now becomes a spinor (or bi-spinor). This latter has
been the traditional route, because of which the Dirac wave function has its
bi-spinorial character. In this latter case, the coordinates retain their usual
commutative or point character. It is only when we consider the equivalent
former alternative, that we return to the noncommutative geometry (11).
That is, in the usual commutative spacetime the Dirac spinorial wave func-
tions conceal the noncommutative character (11).

3 Discussion

We make a few brief comments. As noted earlier if terms of the order of l2
are neglected in the above discussion, we return to ordinary non relativistic
Quantum Mechanics. From Snyder’s relativistically covariant relations (8)

7

we can see that order of l2 terms need to be retained for relativistic theory,
and it is no surprise that the Dirac equation then can be deduced. What we
are seeling here is that for a relativistic theory there is a quantum of area of
the order l2 that is fundamental (Cf. also ref.[28]).
We have also noted that the usual angular momentum at the Compton scale
which we get for example in the noncommutative relations of (8) when order
l2 terms are retained, represents spin. Another way of looking at this is that
from the Dirac theory we have (Cf. [22] and [29])

~x = (c2~p/H)t + ˆx

c2~p
H −
In (17), the ﬁrst terms on the right give the usual position and momentum,
while the second term is the “extra coordinate” due to zitterbewegung. The
angular momentum at the Compton scale is now given by

c~α =

and similar equation for the other components. In (18) E is the eigen value
of the Hamiltonian operator. It shows that the usual angular momentum,
but in the context of the Compton scale leads to the mysterious Quantum
Mechanical spin contained in the ~α matrices (Cf.ref.[26]).
Finally we remark that given the noncommutative geometry (11), it is pos-
sible to obtain a uniﬁed description of interactions [16].

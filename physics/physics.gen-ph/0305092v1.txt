In this paper we present the formulation of relativistic electrodynamics (in-
dependent of the reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates
in it) that uses the Faraday bivector ﬁeld F. This formulation with F ﬁeld
is a self-contained, complete and consistent formulation that dispenses with
either electric and magnetic ﬁelds or the electromagnetic potentials. All
physical quantities are deﬁned without reference frames or, when some basis
is introduced, every quantity is represented as a coordinate-based geometric
quantity comprising both components and a basis. The new, observer inde-
pendent, expressions for the stress-energy vector T (n) (1-vector), the energy
density U (scalar), the Poynting vector S and the momentum density g (1-
vectors), the angular momentum density M (bivector) and the Lorentz force
K (1-vector) are directly derived from the ﬁeld equations with F . The local
conservation laws are also directly derived from the ﬁeld equations.

Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed
to fade away into mere shadows and only a kind of union of
the two will preserve an independent reality. H. Minkowski

1. INTRODUCTION

In the usual Cliﬀord algebra treatments of the relativistic electrodynamics,
e.g., with multivectors [1 − 3] (for a more mathematical treatment of the
Cliﬀord algebra see also [4]), the ﬁeld equations expressed in terms of the
Faraday bivector ﬁeld F are written as a single equation using the F ﬁeld
and the gradient operator ∂ (1-vector).
In order to get the more familiar

1

form the bivector ﬁeld F is expressed (in [1,2]) in terms of the sum of a
relative vector EH (corresponds to the three-dimensional (3D) electric ﬁeld
vector E) and a relative bivector γ5BH (BH corresponds to the 3D magnetic
ﬁeld vector B, and γ5 is the (grade-4) pseudoscalar for the standard basis
{γµ}) by making a space-time split in the γ0 - frame, which depends on the
observer velocity γ0; the subscript ’H’ is for - Hestenes. Both EH and BH
are, in fact, bivectors. Similarly in [3] F is decomposed in terms of 1-vector
EJ and a bivector BJ ; the subscript ’J’ is for - Jancewicz.
It is generally
accepted in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism (and in the tensor formalism as
well) that the usual Maxwell equations with the 3D vectors E and B and the
ﬁeld equations written in terms of F (or the abstract tensor F ab in the tensor
formalism) are completely equivalent. Further both in the tensor formalism
and in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism it is assumed that the components of
the 3D E and B deﬁne in a unique way the components of F . This means that
the 3D E and B and not the F ﬁeld are considered as primary quantities
for the whole electromagnetism. Then in order to get the wave theory of
electromagnetism the vector potential A is introduced and F is deﬁned in
terms of A. In that case the F ﬁeld appears as the derived quantity from
the potentials. Thence in all usual treatments of the electromagnetism, both
in the tensor formalism and the Cliﬀord algebra formalism, the theory is
presented as that the F ﬁeld does not have an independent existence but is
deﬁned either by the components of the 3D E and B or by the components
of the electromagnetic potential A.

In all usual Cliﬀord algebra formulations of the classical electromag-
netism, e.g., the formulations with Cliﬀord multivectors [1-3], the standard
transformations of the 3D E and B (ﬁrst derived by Lorentz [5] and inde-
pendently by Einstein [6], and subsequently quoted in almost every textbook
and paper on relativistic electrodynamics) are considered to be the Lorentz
transformations of these vectors, see [1-3]. The same opinion holds in the
tensor formalism, see [7]. These transformations are usually derived, [7] and
[1-3], by means of the above mentioned identiﬁcation, i.e., taking that the
components of F and of the transformed F ′ are determined in the same way
by the components of the 3D E and B and of the transformed 3D E′ and B′
respectively. However recently important results are achieved in the works
[8] in the tensor formalism and [9] in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism. Namely
in these works it is exactly proved that the standard transformations of the
3D E and B are not relativistically correct transformations in the 4D space-
time; they are not the Lorentz transformations of the 3D E and B. It is also

2

proved that the standard identiﬁcation of the components of the 3D E and B
with the components of F is not relativistically correct procedure. Thence,
contrary to the general belief, the usual Maxwell equations with the 3D E
and B (i.e., with EH, BH, or EJ , BJ) and the observer independent ﬁeld
equations with the F ﬁeld are not physically equivalent.

Therefore in this paper we present the formulation of relativistic elec-
trodynamics with the bivector ﬁeld F, i.e., the formulation that deal with
well-deﬁned, observer independent, 4D quantities and not with ill-deﬁned
quantities, the 3D E and B, or EH, BH (or EJ, BJ). The presented formula-
tion with the F ﬁeld is a self-contained, complete and consistent formulation
that does not make use either electric and magnetic ﬁelds or the electromag-
netic potential A (thus dispensing with the need for the gauge conditions).
In such formulation the F ﬁeld is the primary quantity for the whole classical
electromagnetism. We also give the new expressions for the observer inde-
pendent stress-energy vector T (n) (1-vector), the energy density U (scalar,
i.e., grade-0 multivector), the Poynting vector S (1-vector), the angular mo-
mentum density M (bivector) and the Lorentz force K (1-vector). They are
all directly derived from the ﬁeld equations with F . The local charge-current
density and local energy-momentum conservation laws are also directly de-
rived from the ﬁeld equations with F and there is no need to introduce the
Lagrangian and the Noether theorem.

2. SHORT REVIEW OF THE INVARIANT SPECIAL RELA-
TIVITY

This formulation of the electromagnetism with the F ﬁeld exclusively deals
with well-deﬁned 4D quantities. Namely in such formulation physical quan-
tities are represented by Cliﬀord multivectors that are deﬁned without ref-
erence frames (when no basis has been introduced) or equivalently by a
coordinate-based geometric quantity comprising both components and a ba-
sis (when some basis has been introduced). Thus these quantities are inde-
pendent of the chosen inertial frame of reference and of the chosen system of
coordinates in it, i.e., they are observer independent quantities. The special
relativity that exclusively uses quantities deﬁned without reference frames
or, equivalently, the coordinate-based geometric quantities, can be called
the invariant special relativity. The reason for this name is that upon the
passive Lorentz transformations any coordinate-based geometric quantity re-
mains unchanged. The invariance of some 4D coordinate-based geometric

3

quantity upon the passive Lorentz transformations reﬂects the fact that such
mathematical, invariant, geometric 4D quantity represents the same physical
object for relatively moving observers.
It is taken in the invariant special
relativity that such 4D geometric quantities are well-deﬁned not only mathe-
matically but also experimentally, as measurable quantities with real physical
meaning. Thus they do have an independent physical reality. The invariant
special relativity is discussed in [10-12] in the tensor formalism and in [13]
in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism. It is explicitly shown in [12] that the true
agreement with experiments that test special relativity exists when the the-
ory deals with such well-deﬁned 4D quantities, i.e., the quantities that are
invariant upon the passive Lorentz transformations. The principle of relativ-
ity is automatically included in such formulation with observer independent
quantities, i.e., in the invariant special relativity, whereas in the traditional
formulation of special relativity this principle acts as the postulate established
outside the mathematical formulation of the theory. The F formulation of
the electromagnetism that is presented here is a part of the invariant special
relativity that is developed in [10-13].
In [13] we have also presented the
Cliﬀord algebra formulations of relativistic electrodynamics with 1-vectors
E and B, with the real multivector Ψ = E − e5cB and with the complex
1-vector Ψ = E − icB (i is the unit imaginary). These formulations are
completely equivalent to the formulation with the F ﬁeld, but every of them
is an independent, consistent and complete formulation. However it is worth
noting that in these formulations of electrodynamics in [13] with E, B, the
real and complex Ψ the expressions for the stress-energy vector T (v) and
all quantities derived from T (v) are written for the special case when v, the
velocity of observers who measure E and B ﬁelds is v = cn, where n is the
unit normal to a hypersurface through which the ﬂow of energy-momentum
(T (n)) is calculated. The more general case with v 6= n will be reported
in detail elsewhere. It is important to note that the observer independent
quantities introduced here and the ﬁeld equations written in terms of them
are of the same form both in the ﬂat and curved spacetimes.

3. SHORT REVIEW OF GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

First we provide a brief summary of geometric algebra. We write Cliﬀord
vectors in lower case (a) and general multivectors (Cliﬀord aggregate) in
upper case (A). The space of multivectors is graded and multivectors con-
taining elements of a single grade, r, are termed homogeneous and written

4

g

e

e

e

Ar. The geometric (Cliﬀord) product is written by simply juxtaposing mul-
tivectors AB. A basic operation on multivectors is the degree projection
hAir which selects from the multivector A its r− vector part (0 = scalar,
1 = vector, 2 = bivector ....). We write the scalar (grade-0) part simply as
hAi . The geometric product of a grade-r multivector Ar with a grade-s mul-
tivector Bs decomposes into ArBs = hABi r+s + hABi r+s−2 ... + hABi |r−s| .
The inner and outer (or exterior) products are the lowest-grade and the
highest-grade terms respectively of the above series Ar · Bs ≡ hABi |r−s| ,
and Ar ∧ Bs ≡ hABi r+s . For vectors a and b we have ab = a · b + a ∧ b, where
a · b ≡ (1/2)(ab + ba), and a ∧ b ≡ (1/2)(ab − ba). Reversion is an invariant
a = a, for any vector a,
kind of conjugation, which is deﬁned by
and it reverses the order of vectors in any given expression.

AB =

A,

B

In the treatments, e.g., [1 − 3], one usualy introduces the standard ba-
sis. The generators of the spacetime algebra (the Cliﬀord algebra generated
by Minkowski spacetime) are taken to be four basis vectors {γµ} , µ = 0...3,
satisfying γµ · γν = ηµν = diag(+ − −−). This basis is a right-handed or-
thonormal frame of vectors in the Minkowski spacetime M 4 with γ0 in the
forward light cone. The γk (k = 1, 2, 3) are spacelike vectors. This algebra is
often called the Dirac algebra D and the elements of D are called d−numbers.
The γµ generate by multiplication a complete basis, the standard basis, for
spacetime algebra: 1, γµ, γµ ∧ γν, γµγ5,γ5 (24 = 16 independent elements). γ5
is the pseudoscalar for the frame {γµ} .

We remark that the standard basis corresponds, in fact, to the speciﬁc
system of coordinates, i.e., the Einstein system of coordinates, of the chosen
inertial frame of reference. (In the Einstein system of coordinates the Einstein
synchronization [6] of distant clocks and Cartesian space coordinates xi are
used in the chosen inertial frame of reference.) However diﬀerent systems
of coordinates of an inertial frame of reference are allowed and they are all
equivalent in the description of physical phenomena. For example, in [10] two
very diﬀerent, but completely equivalent systems of coordinates, the Einstein
system of coordinates and ”radio” (”r”) system of coordinates, are exposed
and exploited throughout the paper. For more detail about the ”r” system
of coordinates see, e.g., [10] and references therein.

Thence instead of the standard basis {γµ} , µ = 0...3, for M 4 we can use
some basis {eµ} (the metric tensor of M 4 is then deﬁned as gµν = eµ · eν) and
its dual basis {eµ} , where the set of basis vectors eµ is related to the eµ by
the conditions eµ · eν = δν
µ. The pseudoscalar e5 of a frame {eµ} is deﬁned by

5

e5 = e0 ∧ e1 ∧ ∧e2 ∧ e3. Then, e.g., the position 1-vector x can be decomposed
in the S and S′ frames and in the standard basis {γµ} and some non-standard
γµ′ = .... = xµ′
basis {eµ} as x = xµγµ = xµ′
e eµ′. The primed quantities are
the Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones. Similarly any multivector A
can be written as an invariant quantity with the components and a basis, i.e.,
as a coordinate-based geometric quantity. In such interpretation the Lorentz
transformations are considered as passive transformations; both the compo-
nents and the basis vectors are transformed but the whole geometric quantity
remains unchanged. Thus we see that under the passive Lorentz transforma-
tions a well-deﬁned quantity on the 4D spacetime, i.e., a coordinate-based
geometric quantity, is an invariant quantity. In the usual Cliﬀord algebra
formalism, e.g., [1 − 4], the Lorentz transformations are considered as active
transformations; the components of, e.g., some 1-vector relative to a given
inertial frame of reference (with the standard basis {γµ}) are transformed
into the components of a new 1-vector relative to the same frame (the basis
{γµ} is not changed). (We note that a coordinate-free form for the Lorentz
transformations is presented in [13] and it can be used both in an active way,
when there is no basis, or in a passive way, when some basis is introduced.)
The next step in the usual treatments, e.g., [1 − 3], is the introduction of
a space-time split and the relative vectors. Since the usual spacetime algebra
deals exclusively with the Einstein system of coordinates it is possible to
say that a given inertial frame of reference is completely characterized by
a single future-pointing, timelike unit vector γ0 (γ0 is tangent to the world
line of an observer at rest in the γ0-system). By singling out a particular
time-like direction γ0 we can get a unique mapping of spacetime into the
even subalgebra of the spacetime algebra (the Pauli subalgebra). For each
spacetime point (or event) x this mapping is speciﬁed by

xγ0 = ct + x,

ct = x · γ0, x = x ∧ γ0.

(1)

To each event x the equation (1) assigns a unique time and position in the γ0-
system. The set of all position vectors x is the 3-dimensional position space
of the observer γ0 and it is designated by P 3 = P 3(γ0) = {x = x ∧ γ0} . The
elements of P 3 are all spacetime bivectors with γ0 as a common factor (x∧γ0).
They are called the relative vectors (relative to γ0) and they will be designated
in boldface. Then a standard basis {σk; k = 1, 2, 3} for P 3, which corresponds
to a standard basis {γµ} for M 4 is given as σk = γk ∧γ0 = γkγ0. The invariant
distance x2 then decomposes as x2 = (xγ0)(γ0x) = (ct−x)(ct+x) = c2t2−x2.
The explicit appearance of γ0 in (1) imply that the space-time split is observer

6

dependent, i.e., it is dependent on the chosen inertial frame of reference. It
has to be noted that in the Einstein system of coordinates the space-time split
of the position 1-vector x (1) gives separately the space and time components
of x with their usual meaning, i.e., as in the prerelativistic physics, and (as
shown above) in the invariant distance x2 the spatial and temporal parts are
also separated. (In the ”r” system of coordinates there is no space-time split
and also in x2 the spatial and temporal parts are not separated, see [10].)
This does not mean that the Einstein system of coordinates does have some
advantages relative to other systems of coordinates and that the quantities
in the Einstein system of coordinates are more physical than, e.g., those in
the ”r” system of coordinates.

0 = ct′ + x′, and this xγ′

Diﬀerent systems of coordinates refer to the same inertial frame of ref-
erence, say the S frame. But if we consider the geometric quantity, the
position 1-vector x in another relatively moving inertial frame of reference
0, then the space-time split in S′ and in the
S′, which is characterized by γ′
Einstein system of coordinates is xγ′
0 is not obtained
by the Lorentz transformations (or any other coordinate transformations)
from xγ0. (The hypersurface t′ = const. is not connected in any way with
the hypersurface t = const.) Thus the customary Cliﬀord algebra approaches
to special relativity start with the geometric, i.e., coordinate-free, quantities,
e.g., x, x2, etc., which are physically well-deﬁned. However the use of the
space-time split introduces in the customary approaches such coordinate-
dependent quantities which are not physically well-deﬁned since they cannot
be connected by the Lorentz transformations. The main diﬀerence between
our approach to special relativity (by the use of the Cliﬀord algebra) and the
other Cliﬀord algebra approaches is that in our approach, as already said,
the physical meaning is attributed, both theoretically and experimentally, only
to the geometric 4D quantities, and not to their parts. We consider, in the
same way as H. Minkowski (the motto in this paper), that the spatial and
the temporal components (e.g., x and t, respectively) of some geometric 4D
quantity (e.g., x) are not physically well-deﬁned quantities. Only their union
is physically well-deﬁned and only such quantity does have an independent
physical reality.

4. THE F FORMULATION OF ELECTRODYNAMICS

4.1. The Determination of the Electromagnetic Field F

7

We start the exposition of electrodynamics writing the ﬁeld equations in
terms of F [1 − 3]; an electromagnetic ﬁeld is represented by a bivector-
valued function F = F (x) on spacetime. The source of the ﬁeld is the
electromagnetic current j which is a 1-vector ﬁeld. Then using that the
gradient operator ∂ is a 1-vector ﬁeld equations can be written as a single
equation

∂F = j/ε0c,

∂ · F + ∂ ∧ F = j/ε0c.

(2)

The trivector part is identically zero in the absence of magnetic charge. No-
tice that in [1 − 3] the ﬁeld equations (2) are considered to encode all of the
Maxwell equations. Thus it is assumed in all usual approaches in the Clif-
ford algebra formalism that the ﬁeld equations (2) and the usual Maxwell
equations with the 3D E and B (i.e., with EH, BH or EJ, BJ) are physically
equivalent. However, as already said, it is exactly proved in [8] and [9] that,
contrary to the general belief, such equivalence does not exist. Thence the
ﬁeld equations (2) are, in fact, a relativistically correct generalization of the
usual Maxwell equations with the 3D E and B.

The ﬁeld bivector F yields the complete description of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and, in fact, there is no need to introduce either the ﬁeld vectors or the
potentials. For the given sources the Cliﬀord algebra formalism enables one
to ﬁnd in a simple way the electromagnetic ﬁeld F. Namely the gradient
operator ∂ is invertible and (2) can be solved for

F = ∂−1(j/ε0c),

(3)

see, e.g., [14] and [1] Spacetime Calculus. We brieﬂy repeat the main points
related to (3) from these references. The important diﬀerence is that for us,
as proved in [8] and [9], the ﬁeld equations (2) are not equivalent to the usual
Maxwell equations with the 3D E and B. ∂−1 is an integral operator which
depends on boundary conditions on F and (3) is an integral form of the ﬁeld
equations (2). If the charge-current density j(x) is the sole source of F, then
(3) provides the unique solution to the ﬁeld equations (2). By using Gauss’
Theorem an important formula can be found that allows to calculate F at
any point y inside m-dimensional manifold M from its derivative ∂F and its
values on the boundary ∂M if a Green’s function G(y, x) is known,

F (y) =

G(y, x)∂F (x) | dmx | −

G(y, x)n−1F (x) | dm−1x |,

(4)

ZM

Z∂M

n is a unit normal, n−1 = n if n2 = 1 or n−1 = −n if n2 = −1, and G(y, x)
is a solution to the diﬀerential equation ∂yG(y, x) = δm(y − x). ((4) is the

8

relation (4.17) in [14].)
vanishes. This general relation can be applied to diﬀerent examples.

If ∂F = 0 the ﬁrst term on the right side of (4)

An example is the determination of the expression for the classical Li´enard-
Wiechert ﬁeld that is given, e.g., in [14] and [1] Spacetime Calculus. The
usual procedure ([14] and [1]) is to utilize the general relation (4), in which
all quantities are deﬁned without reference frames (Geometric calculus), and
to specify it to the Minkowski spacetime (m = 4). Then a space-time split
is introduced by the relation

ct = x · n = x · γ0

(5)

from (1). (n in (4) is taken to be γ0 and (5) is the equation for a 1-parameter
family of spacelike hyperplanes S(t) with normal γ0; S(t) is a surface of
simultaneous t.) Further, for simplicity, M is taken to be the entire region
between the hyperplanes S1 = S(t1) and S2 = S(t2). We note that the same
objections hold for such procedure as those that are mentioned at the end
of Sec. 3.
for the space-time split. Further, as explained in the preceding
section, such procedure with the space-time split can be made only when
the metric tensor of spacetime is taken to be the Minkowski metric tensor,
i.e., when space and time are separated. For example it would not work for
the above mentioned ”r” system of coordinates, [10]. We shall not discuss
this derivation further but we only quote the result for the classical Li´enard-
Wiechert ﬁeld. The charge-current density for a particle with charge q and
−∞ dτ vδ4(x−z(τ )), where
world line z = z(τ ) with proper time τ is j(x) = q
R
v = v(τ ) = dz/dτ . Then the classical Li´enard-Wiechert retarded ﬁeld for q
(see, e.g., Sec. 5 in [14]) is

∞

F (x) = (q/4πε0)

r ∧ (v/c) + (1/2c2)r ˙v(v/c)r
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

/(r · v/c)3,

(6)

where r = x − z satisﬁes the light-cone condition r2 = 0 and z, v, ˙v = dv/dτ
are all evaluated at the intersection of the backward light cone (with vertex
at x) and world line of that charge q.
It is worth noting that from the
general expression (4) one can derive not only the retarded interpretation
for F of a charge q but also the advanced interpretation and the present-
time interpretation, i.e., an instantaneous action-at-a-distance interpretation.
(This present-time interpretation will be reported elsewhere. In the tensor
formalism the expressions for F ab and the 4-vectors Ea and Ba in the present-
time interpretation for an uniform and uniformly accelerated motion of a
charge q are given in [15].)

4.2. The Lorentz Force and the Motion of a Charged Particle in

the Electromagnetic Field F

In the ﬁeld view of particle-to-particle interaction the electrodynamic inter-
action between charges is described as two-steps process; ﬁrst ﬁelds are seen
as being generated from their particle sources and then the ﬁelds so gener-
ated are perceived as interacting with some target particle. The description
of the ﬁrst step in the F formulation of electrodynamics is given by the above
relations (2), (3), (4) and for a particle with charge q with (6). The second
step requires the determination of the Lorentz force in terms of F and its use
in Newton’s second law. This will be undertaken below.

In the Cliﬀord algebra formalism one can easily derive the expressions for
the stress-energy vector T (n) and the Lorentz force density K directly from
j/ε0c
ﬁeld equations (2) and from the equation for
∂ diﬀerentiates to the left instead of to the right). Indeed, using (2) and
(
from the equation for
e

F , the reverse of F,

F one ﬁnds

∂ =

F

e

e

e

e

e

T (∂) = (−ε0/2)(F ∂F ) = j · F/c = −Kj,

(7)

where in (F ∂F ) the derivative ∂ operates to the left and to the right by the
chain rule. The stress-energy vector T (n) [1 − 3] for the electromagnetic ﬁeld
is then deﬁned in the F formulation as

T (n) = T (n(x), x) = −(ε0/2) hF nF i1 .

(8)

We note that T (n) is a vector-valued linear function on the tangent space at
each spacetime point x describing the ﬂow of energy-momentum through a
hypersurface with normal n = n(x).

The right hand side of (7) yields the expression for the Lorentz force
density Kj, Kj = F · j/c. This relation shows that the Lorentz force density
Kj can be interpreted as the rate of energy-momentum transfer from the
source j to the ﬁeld F . The Lorentz force in the F formulation for a charge q
is K = (q/c)F · v, where v is the velocity 1-vector of a charge q (it is deﬁned
to be the tangent to its world line).

In the approaches [1,2] the Lorentz force is discussed using the space-
time split and the corresponding decomposition of F into the electric and
magnetic components. Namely the bivector ﬁeld F is expressed in terms of
the sum of a relative vector EH and a relative bivector γ5BH by making a

10

space-time split in the γ0 - frame

F = EH + cγ5BH, EH = (F · γ0)γ0 = (1/2)(F − γ0F γ0),

γ5BH = (F ∧ γ0)γ0 = (1/2c)(F + γ0F γ0),

(9)

and similarly in [3] F is expressed in the γ0 - frame by EJ and BJ. However
the formulation with F is, as already said, a self-contained and complete
formulation of electrodynamics and there is no need for the introduction of
EH, BH or EJ , BJ from [1-3], i.e., the usual 3D electric E and magnetic
B ﬁelds. Besides it is shown in [8,9] that the mentioned decompositions of
F from [1-3] lead to the standard transformations of the 3D E and B that
are not relativistically correct transformations. (The relativistically correct
relations that connect the formulation of electrodynamics with F and the
equivalent, but independent, self-contained and complete formulation with
well-deﬁned 4D quantities, the electric and magnetic 1-vectors E and B,
are given in [13].) Thus in the analysis of the motion of a charged particle
under the action of the Lorentz force we utilize only those parts of the usual
approaches [1-3] that are expressed only in terms of F and not those expressed
by EH, BH or EJ , BJ . Actually we shall only quote the main results from
[1-3] for the motion of a charged particle in a constant electromagnetic ﬁeld
F but without using EH, BH or EJ , BJ .

The particle equation of motion, i.e., Newton’s second law is

m ˙v = qF · v,

(10)

where ˙v = dv/dτ ; the overdot denotes diﬀerentation with respect to proper
time τ . Usually [1,2] the equation (10) is not solved directly but solving the
rotor equation ˙R = (q/2m)F R and using the invariant canonical form for
F, which is F = f eIϕ = f (cos ϕ + I sin ϕ); this holds for F 2 6= 0, and here
γ5 is denoted as I. Let us consider that F is an uniform electromagnetic
ﬁeld. Then denoting (q/m)F = Ω, Ω1 = f (q/m) cos ϕ, Ω2 = f (q/m) sin ϕ,
and making an invariant decomposition of the initial velocity v(0) into a
component v1 in the f -plane and a component v2 orthogonal to the f -plane,
v(0) = f −1(f · v(0)) + f −1(f ∧ v(0)) = v1 + v2, we get

v = e(1/2)Ω1τ v1 + e(1/2)Ω2τ v2.

(11)

As stated in [1], Spacetime Calculus, this is an invariant decomposition of
the motion into ”electriclike” and ”magneticlike” components. The particle

11

history is obtained integrating (11)

x(τ ) − x(0) = (e(1/2)Ω1τ − 1)Ω−1

1 v1 + e(1/2)Ω2τ Ω−1

2 v2.

(12)

(For more details see [1-3].) This result applies for arbitrary initial conditions
and arbitrary uniform electromagnetic ﬁeld F . Of course the special cases can
be investigated without introducing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We shall
not discuss here another cases that are considered in [1-3] (e.g., a charge in
an electromagnetic plane wave), but we note that they also can be examined
exclusively in terms of F without introducing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

4.3. The Stress-Energy Vector T (n) and the Quantities Derived

from T (n)

The most important quantity for the momentum and energy of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld is the observer independent stress-energy vector T (n). It can
be written in the following form

T (n) = −(ε0/2) [(F · F )n + 2(F · n) · F ] .

(13)

We present a new form for T (n) (13) writing it as a sum of n-parallel part
(n− k) and n-orthogonal part (n− ⊥)

T (n) = −(ε0/2)
− ε0

(F · F ) + 2(F · n)2
(cid:2)
.

(F · n) · F − (F · n)2n
(cid:3)
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

n+

The ﬁrst term in (14) is n− k part and it yields the energy density U. Namely
using T (n) and the fact that n · T (n) is positive for any timelike vector n
we construct the expression for the observer independent energy density U
contained in an electromagnetic ﬁeld as U = n · T (n) = hnT (n)i , (scalar,
i.e., grade-0 multivector). Thus in terms of F and (14) U becomes

U = (−ε0/2) hF nF ni = −(ε0/2)

(F · F ) + 2(F · n)2
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

.

The second term in (14) is n− ⊥ part and it is (1/c)S, where S is the observer
independent expression for the Poynting vector (1-vector),

(14)

(15)

(16)

S = −ε0c

(F · n) · F − (F · n)2n
(cid:3)
(cid:2)

,

12

and, as can be seen, n · S = 0. Thus T (n) expressed by U and S is

T (n) = Un + (1/c)S.

(17)

Notice that the decompositions of T (n), (13), (14) and (17), are all observer
independent decompositions. Further the observer independent momentum
density g is deﬁned as g = (1/c2)S, i.e., g is (1/c) of the n− ⊥ part from
(14)

g = −(ε0/c)

(F · n) · F − (F · n)2n
(cid:3)
(cid:2)

.

(18)

From T (n) (14) one ﬁnds also the expression for the observer independent
angular-momentum density M

M = (1/c)T (n) ∧ x = (1/c)U(n ∧ x) + g ∧ x.

(19)

It has to be emphasized once again that all these deﬁnitions are the deﬁnitions
of the quantities that are independent of the chosen reference frame and of
the chosen system of coordinates in it. As I am aware they are not presented
earlier in the literature.

All these quantities can be written in some basis {eµ} , which does not
need to be the standard basis, as coordinate-based geometric quantities. The
ﬁeld bivector F can be written as F = (1/2)F αβeα ∧ eβ where the basis
components F αβ are determined as F αβ = eβ · (eα · F ) = (eβ ∧ eα) · F .
Then the quantities entering into the expressions for T (n), U, S, g and M
are F · F = −(1/2)F αβFαβ, F · n = F αβnβeα, (F · n)2 = F αβFανnβnν and
(F · n) · F = F αβFανnβeν. Thence T (n) (13) becomes

T (n) = −(ε0/2)

(1/2)F αβFβαnρeρ + 2F αβFαρnρeβ
(cid:2)
the energy density U (15) is

(cid:3)

,

U = −(ε0/2)

(1/2)F αβFβα + 2F αβFαρnρnβ
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

,

and the Poynting vector S (16) becomes

S = −ε0c

F αβFαρnρeβ − F αβFαρnρnβnλeλ
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

.

In some basis {eµ} we can write the stress-energy vectors T µ as T µ = T (eµ) =
(−ε0/2)F eµF. The components of the T µ represent the energy-momentum
tensor T µν in the {eµ} basis T µν = T µ·eν = (−ε0/2) hF eµF eνi, which reduces
to familiar tensor form

T µν = ε0

F µαgαβF βν + (1/4)F αβFαβgµν

In the usual Cliﬀord algebra aproach, e.g., [1, 2], one again makes the
space-time split and considers the energy-momentum density in the γ0-system
(the standard basis {γµ}) T 0 = T (γ0) = T (γ0); the split T 0γ0 = T 0γ0 = T 00+
T0, separates T 0 into an energy density T 00 = T 0·γ0 and a momentum density
T0 = T 0 ∧γ0. Then from the expression for T µ and the relations (9) one ﬁnds
[1,2] the familiar results for the energy density T 00 = (ε0/2)(E2
H) and
the Poyinting vector T0 = ε0(EH×cBH), where the commutator product
A × B is deﬁned as A × B ≡ (1/2)(AB − BA). However, as already said, the
space-time split and the usual electric and magnetic ﬁelds EH and BH are
not only unnecessary but, as shown in [8,9], they are relativistically incorrect.

4.4. The Local Conservation Laws in the F - Formulation

It is well-known that from the ﬁeld equations in the F - formulation (2)
one can derive a set of conserved currents. Thus, for example, in the F -
formulation one derives in the standard way that j from (2) is a conserved
current. Simply, the vector derivative ∂ is applied to the ﬁeld equations (2)
which yields

(1/ε0c)∂ · j = ∂ · (∂ · F ).

Using the identity ∂ · (∂ · M(x)) ≡ 0 (M(x) is a multivector ﬁeld) one obtains
the local charge conservation law

In a like manner we ﬁnd from (7) that

∂ · j = 0.

∂ · T (n) = 0

(24)

(25)

In
for the free ﬁelds. This is a local energy-momentum conservation law.
the derivation of (7) we used the fact that T (a) is symmetric,
i.e., that
a · T (b) = T (a) · b. Namely using accents the expression for T (∂) (T (∂) =
(−ε0/2)(F ∂F ), where ∂ operates to the left and to the right by the chain
rule) can be written as T (∂) = ´T ( ´∂) = (−ε0/2)( ´F ´∂F + F ´∂ ´F ) = 0, since in
the absence of sources ∂F = ´F ´∂ = 0 (the accent denotes the multivector on
which the derivative acts). Then from the above mentioned symmetry of T
one ﬁnds that ´T ( ´∂) · a = ∂ · T (a) = 0, ∀ const. a, which proves the equation
(25).

14

Inserting the expression (17) for T (n) into the local energy-momentum

conservation law (25) we ﬁnd

(n · ∂)U + (1/c)∂ · S = 0.

(26)

The relation (26) is the well-known Poynting’s theorem but now completely
written in terms of the observer independent quantities. Let us introduce
the standard basis {γµ} , i.e., an inertial frame of reference with the Einstein
system of coordinates, and in the {γµ} basis we choose that n = γ0, or in
the component form it is nµ(1, 0, 0, 0). Then the familiar form of Poynting’s
theorem is recovered in such coordinate system

∂U/∂t + ∂iSi = 0,

i = 1, 2, 3.

(27)

It is worthwhile to note that although U (15) and S (14), taken separately,
are well-deﬁned observer independent quantities, the relations (17), (25) and
(26) reveal that only T (n) (17), as a whole quantity, i.e., the combination of
U and S, enters into a fundamental physical law, the local energy-momentum
conservation law (25). Thence one can say that only T (n) (17), as a whole
quantity, does have a real physical meaning, or, better to say, a physically
correct interpretation. An interesting example that emphasizes this point is
the case of an uniformly accelerated charge. In the usual (3D) approach to
the electrodynamics ([7]; Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, Sec. 6.8.) the
Poynting vector S is interpreted as an energy ﬂux due to the propagation
of ﬁelds. In such an interpretation it is not clear how the ﬁelds propagate
along the axis of motion since for the ﬁeld points on the axis of motion one
ﬁnds that S = 0 (there is no energy ﬂow) but at the same time U 6= 0 (there
is an energy density). Our approach reveals that the important quantity is
T (n) and not S and U taken separately. T (n) is 6= 0 everywhere on the
axis of motion and the local energy-momentum conservation law (25) holds
everywhere.

In the same way one can derive the local angular momentum conservation

law, see [1] , Space-Time Calculus.

5. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

It is shown in [12] that the usual formulation of special relativity (which
deals with the observer dependent quantities, i.e., the Lorentz contraction,
the dilatation of time, the use of the 3D E and B, etc.,) shows only an

15

”apparent” agreement (not the true one) with the traditional and modern
experiments, e.g., the Michelson-Morley type experiments. On the contrary
it is shown in [12] that the invariant special relativity from [10] (given in terms
of geometric quantities - abstract tensors) is in a complete agreement with all
considered experiments. This entails that the same complete agreement holds
also for the formulation with geometric quantities - the Cliﬀord multivectors,
which is presented in this paper.

In addition we brieﬂy discuss the Trouton-Noble experiment [16] (see also
[17]). In the experiment they looked for the turning motion of a charged par-
allel plate capacitor suspended at rest in the frame of the earth in order to
measure the earth’s motion through the ether. The explanations, which are
given until now (see, e.g., [18]), for the null result of the experiments [16]
([17]) are not relativistically correct, since they use quantities that are not
well-deﬁned in 4D spacetime; e.g., the Lorentz contraction, the transforma-
tion equations for the usual 3D vectors E and B and for the torque as the 3D
vector, the nonelectromagnetic forces of undeﬁned nature, etc.. In our ap-
proach the explanation is very simple and natural; the energy density U, then
g and M and the associated integral quantities are all invariant quantities,
which means that their values are the same in the rest frame of the capacitor
and in the moving frame. Thus if there is no torque (but now as a geometric,
invariant, 4D quantity) in the rest frame then the capacitor cannot appear
to be rotating in a uniformly moving frame.

6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The usual Cliﬀord algebra approach to the relativistic electrodynamics deals
with the space-time split and the relative vectors EH, BH (from [1,2]) or EJ ,
BJ (from [3]). The investigation presented in [8,9] and [13] reveals that such
approach is not relativistically correct. The usual 3D E and B, or the relative
vectors EH, BH [1,2], or EJ , BJ [3], are not only observer dependent quan-
tities but, as shown in [8,9], their transformation laws are meaningless from
the special relativity viewpoint; they have nothing to do with the Lorentz
transformations of the well-deﬁned quantities on the 4D spacetime. Here we
employ quantities that are independent of the reference frame and of the cho-
sen system of coordinates for that frame. We have presented the formulation
of electrodynamics by means of the ﬁeld bivector F. This formulation with
the F ﬁeld is a self-contained, complete and consistent formulation that does
not make use either electric and magnetic ﬁelds or the electromagnetic po-

16

tential A. It provides complete and consistent description of electromagnetic
phenomena in terms of observer independent, thus properly deﬁned quanti-
ties on the 4D spacetime. The formulation with the F ﬁeld is not physically
equivalent with the usual Maxwell formulation with the 3D vectors E and
B, since, as shown in [8,9], the transformation laws for the 3D E and B are
not relativistically correct transformations. The observer independent ﬁeld
equations with the F ﬁeld and the new observer independent expressions
for the stress-energy vector T (n), the energy density U, the Poynting vec-
tor S, the momentum density g, the angular-momentum density M and the
Lorentz force K are presented in this paper. The second quantization pro-
cedure, and the whole quantum electrodynamics, will be simply constructed
using geometric, invariant, quantities F , T (n), U, S, g and M. Note that
the standard covariant approaches to quantum electrodynamics, e.g., [19],
usually deal with the component form (in the speciﬁc, i.e., the Einstein sys-
tem of coordinates) of the electromagnetic 4-potential A (thus requiring the
gauge conditions too) instead of to use the geometric quantity, the observer
independent bivector ﬁeld F. Furthermore the standard covariant approaches
employ the deﬁnitions of the ﬁeld energy and momentum, which are not well-
deﬁned from the special relativity viewpoint. Namely, both the ﬁeld energy
and momentum are deﬁned as integrals over the three-space, that is, over the
hypersurface t = const. But the hypersurface t = const. in some reference
frame S cannot become (under the Lorentz transformations) the hypersur-
face t′ = const. in a relatively moving reference frame S′. This is already
examined for the classical electrodynamics (the covariant formulation in the
Einstein system of coordinates) by Rohrlich [20] and using the component
form of the electric and magnetic 4-vectors Eα and Bα (the tensor formalism)
in the ﬁrst paper in [21]. (The second paper in [21] treats relatively mov-
ing systems, e.g., a current-carrying conductor, using the component form
of the electric and magnetic 4-vectors Eα and Bα.) In this paper the local
conservation laws are directly derived from the ﬁeld equations with the F
ﬁeld and written in an invariant way. The observer independent integral
ﬁeld equations and the observer independent global conservation laws (with
the deﬁnitions of the invariant ﬁeld energy and momentum) will be treated
elsewhere. Particularly it has to be emphasized that the observer indepen-
dent approach to the relativistic electrodynamics that is presented in this
paper is in a complete agreement with existing experiments that test special
relativity, which is not the case with the usual approaches. Furthermore we
note that all observer independent quantities introduced here and the ﬁeld

17

equations written in terms of them hold in the same form both in the ﬂat
and curved spacetimes. The formalism presented here will be the basis for
the relativistically correct (without reference frames) formulation of quantum
electrodynamics and, more generally, of the quantum ﬁeld theory.

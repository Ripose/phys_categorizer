Abstract

In this short note , using notions from p-Adic QFT and p-branes,
we derive the transﬁnite M theoretical corrections (αM )−1 = 100+61φ
to El Naschie’s inverse ﬁne structure constant value (αHS)−1 = 100 +
60φ which was based on a transﬁnite Heterotic string theory ormal-
ism . φ is the Golden Mean 0.6180339.... Our results are consistent
with recent Astrophysical observations of he Boomerang and Max-
ima experiments , with previous results based on the four dimensional
gravitational conformal anomaly calculations and with an enhanced
hierarchy of the number of lines on Del Pezzo surfaces.

Motivated by the fact that the bosonic membrane is devoid of anomalies
in d = 27, and the supermembrane is anomaly free in d = 11 [2] , and
that the anomaly free ( super) string actions ( d = 26, 10 ) are directly
obtained by a double-dimensional reduction process of both the world-volume
of the ( super) membrane and the target spacetime dimension , where the (
super) membrane is embedded, we shall derive rigorously the transﬁnite M
theoretical corrections (αM )−1 to El Naschie’s inverse ﬁne structure constant
(αHS)−1 [1] which were based on a transﬁnite perturbative Heterotic string
theory formalism [ 1] .
We will see as well that the inverse ﬁne structure constant derived by the
author [ 3] based on a our dimensional gravitational conformal anomaly cal-
culation [4] (αconf ormal)−1 has for lower/upper bounds the values (αHS)−1
and (αM )−1 respectively. All one needs is to use the following fundamental
identities :

(1 + φ)k = Fk+1 + Fkφ. φk = (

This expansion of (αM )−1 in integer powers of 1 + φ is the analog of the
expansion of 137 in powers of p = 2 :

a lacunar series is given in powers of the form ppn
but this has not the desired
p-Adic form because (1 + φ)n is not an integer as veriﬁed by the fundamental
identities Eq.(1). Also we must restrict the coeﬃcients an to be integer valued

This value of the inverse ﬁne structure constant is associated with a fractal
spacetime dimension of 4 + ǫ = 4 + (φ3/2) . It corresponds to an infrared
f ixed point of the Renormalization Group where scale invariance is restored
[4]. In ordinary ( super ) string theory, a regularization procedure breaks
conformal invariance except in the critical dimensions d = 26; d = 10 . Form
the Conformal Field Theory point of view this implies that the beta function
associated with he world sheet couplings of the non-linear σ model corre-
sponding to the ( super ) string have a f ixed point ; i.e the beta function
vanishes in the critical dimensions and conformal invariance is restored in
those special dimensions.
Hence we have ﬁnally :

(αHS)−1 = 100+60φ = 137.082 < (αconf ormal)−1 = 137.6414 < (αM )−1 = 100+61φ = 137.700

8)
Now we shall go back to the crucial point of having d = 11 as the core dimen-
sion of the transﬁnite nonperturbative M theory. We mentioned earlier that
he bosonic membrane is free of anomalies in d = 27 and the supermenbrane
is anomally free in d = 11 [2] and that strings re obtained automatically by
dimensional reduction . The nonperturbative M theoretic corrections o the
inverse ﬁne structure constant are due to the following p-brane conﬁgurations
for values of p = 0, 2, 5, 10 living n d = 11 topological dimensions . The 5
brane and the membrane , p = 2, are Electromagnetic dual to each other in
d11 since duality requires the numerical relation a 11 = 2 + 5 + 4. The p = 0-
brane corresponds to the center of mass of the system and the p = 10 brane
is the spacetime ﬁlling since 10 + 1 = 11.
Since among our p-brane conﬁgurations we have the membrane (a p = 2 brane
) living in d = 11 dimensions ( and its EM dual 5-brane ) this transﬁnite M
theory does naturally contain heterotic strings in d = 10 dimensions by a
straightforward dimensional reduction of the membrane.
Following Eddington’ view that the inverse ﬁne structure constant is an in-
ternal dimension we can see that the net value 100 + 61φ = (αM )−1 is the
sum of the ( fractal ) Hausdorﬀ dimensions of the four transﬁnite spaces

The ﬁrst term 137 is the usual U(1) contribution; the second term φ5(1

φ5) = 0φ
37 is the electroweak and strong interaction contributions found
by El Naschie [ 1] and the φ additional term is the Nonperturbative M
theoretic corrections; i.e a quantum gravity eﬀect. At ﬁrst hand one may be
inclined to object to such an ” erroneous ” claim because the contribution
of φ is notsmall. In fact it is larger than φ5(1
φ5). However, one must
realize that in this nonperturbative transﬁnite M theory there is a nontrivial
ltraviolet/infrared entanglement ( mixing ) like it occurs in he construction
of Quantum Field Theories in Noncommutative geometry . It is reminiscent
of the large-scale/small-scale T quality in string theory. Therefore, due to
this highly nontrivial ultraviolet/infrared entanglement/mixing the large φ
correction is truly an infrared quantum gravity contribution, as it should
be, since adding this term is precisely what is needed to match the value
obtained from the gravitational conformal anomaly calculation [ 3,4] of the
inverse ﬁne structure constant. Such contribution was due precisely to an
inf rared long distance eﬀect as a result of the quantum conformal mode
ﬂuctuations of the spacetime metric over large scales whose overall eﬀect is
to screen the electric charge at large distances and cause the inverse value
of the ﬁne structure constant to increase.

Therefore, a straightforward p-Adic QFT argument [5,6,7] yields the Non-
perturbative transﬁnite M theoretical corrections to El Naschie’s inverse ine
structure constant obtained from a perturbative string theory setting. The
value 100 + 61φ is consistent with the most recent Astrophysical data of the
spectral density index obtained from the Boomerang and Maxima experi-
ments measuring the primordial cosmological background curvature pertur-
bations 8, 9 ] . The spectral index of the two-point correlation unction of the
Cosmic Microwave Background radiation due to the density perturbations
( induced by the curvature ﬂuctuations ) as given in terms of the quan-
tum trace anomaly [4] and the value s [9] n
3 = 1.0299358 where
∆ = 2.0149679 > 2 in full agreement with the numerical bounds of Covi
and Lyth [8] . In a forthcoming publication [ 9] we hall present a lengthy
and detail discussion of the results discussed in this short note. Especially ,
the deep interrelation among p-Adic QFT [5,6,7] ; the Bruhat-Tits tree-like
p-Adic topology of Cantorian-Fractal Spacetime [1] , the non-Archimedean
geometry associated with the Algebraic continued-fraction renormalization
group-like procedure of the physical constants and he p-Adic hierarchical
structures of ( symmetry breaking ) phases in stochastic processes [ 10, 11 ]
What remains is to look at the hierarchy of dimensions generated by this
transﬁnite M theory. he hierarchy generated by the core dimension of d = 11
is given by 11φn for diﬀerent values of n is :

⇒

Hence this hierarchy has for dimensions :

28.7983, 17.7983, 11, 6.7983, 4.2016.....

The author has been informed by Metod Saniga that this hierarchy in its in-
teger valued part , is almost exactly reproduced by the sequence of number of
lines lying on Del Pezzo surfaces if one adds one to each value : 8; 17; 11; 7; 4
that would mean nothing but that Del Pezzo hierarchy corresponds to spa-
tial dimensions only , while this enhanced hierarchy grasps both space and

time dimensions ! [12] . The lower dimension 4.20016 is consistent with the
four dimensional gravitational anomaly calculation [3, 4 ] and with he recent
astrophysical data [8, 9].

The main conclusion of this work is the following :

The value (αHS)−1 = 100 + 60φ does admit the decomposition 10
21 + φ)4
consistent with the hierarchy of ( complexiﬁed ) dimensions generated by the
core d = 10 dimensions of superstrings but f ails to admit the correct p-Adic
decomposition exhibit by (αM )−1 = 100 + 61φ shown in eqs-(5). Since 61
is a prime number one can see automatically that 100 + 61φ has for lower
and upper bounds the following ( complexiﬁed ) dimensions belonging to
a hierarchy of dimensions generated by the core d = 11 dimensions of the
anomaly free supermembrane :

Constraining the inverse ﬁne structure constant to lie in the interval 136 <
α−1 < 138 and being compatible with recent Astrophysical data [8, 9 ] and
with the gravitational conformal anomaly results [3, 4 ] , which imposes d =
4 + ǫ , we conclude that one cannot simultaneously satisfy both conditions of
α−1 having the correct p-adic expansion like in eq-(5) and in being a member
of the hierarchy of complexiﬁed dimensions of the form α−1 = 2d(1 + φ)k for
d = integer core-dimensions and k = integer. One would require to have a
relation of the type :

136 < X
n

an(1 + φ)n = 2d(1 + φ)k < 138.

(11)

it seems that this equation does not have solutions for an = 0, 1 and d, n, k =
integers in the range between : 136 < α−1 < 138.

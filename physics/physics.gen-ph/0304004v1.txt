Abstract

Model of Expansive Nondecelerative Universe (ENU) due to in-
volving Vaidya metric makes it possible to localize the energy density
of gravitational ﬁeld. This its capability allows for answering several
open questions and supporting (or contradicting) results obtained us-
ing diﬀerent theoretical approaches. This paper is aimed to contribut-
ing to a solution of some cosmological problems, in particular those
linked to the Yukawa potential consequences, independent way of dark
matter estimation, ionospheric F2 layer behaviour, and cyclotron ra-
diation.

1 Introduction

Starting from the beginning of 80’s, the inﬂation model of the universe ac-
quired dominant position in cosmology. The model has been able to eliminate
certain cosmological problems, at the same time it has, however, open new
questions, such as the Universe age, Hubble’s constant or deceleration param-
eter values. It has not, however, contributed to deepen our understanding of

1

the gravitation and its relation to the other physical interactions. Moreover,
in accordance with some analyses [1], the initial nonhomogenities should not
be eliminated but they are rather enhanced within the inﬂation period.

Open questions have been a challenge for developing further models of
the Universe, one of them being Expansive Nondecelerative Universe model
[2-4]. The ENU model manifest its capability both by oﬀering answers to
several open questions and supporting results obtained by other theoretical
approaches. The present paper continues in this tendency and is aimed to
contributing to a solution of some cosmological problems, in particular those
linked to the Yukawa potential consequences, independent way of dark matter
estimation, ionospheric F2 layer behaviour, and cyclotron radiation.

2 Background of Expansive Nondecelerative

Universe model

The cornerstones of ENU, rationalized in more detail in [2-4] are as follows:

1. The Universe, throughout the whole expansive evolutionary phase, ex-
pands by a constant rate equals the speed of light c obeying thus rela-
tion

rU = c tU =

2 G mU
c2

(1)

where rU is the Universe radius, tU is the cosmological time, mU is the
∼= 1.299 x 1026
Universe mass (their present ENU-based values are rU
∼= 1.373 x 1010 yr, and match well with
m, mU
generally accepted values [5-7]).

∼= 8.673 x 1052 kg, tU

2. The curvature index and Einstein cosmologic constant are of zero value.

3. The mean energy density of the Universe is identical just to its critical
density (its present value given by the ENU is 9.536 × 10−27 kg/m3,
that provided in [6] is 9.47 × 10−27 kg/m3).

4. Since a is increasing in time, mU must increase as well, i.e.

in the
ENU, the creation of matter occurs. The total mass-energy of the
Universe must, however, be exactly zero. It is achieved by a simulta-
neous gravitational ﬁeld creation, the energy of which is negative. The
fundamental mass-energy conservation law is thus observed.

2

5. Due to the matter creation, Schwarzschild metrics must be replaced in
ENU by Vaidya metrics [8, 9] in which the line element is formulated
as

and the scalar curvature R (which is, contrary to a more frequently used
Schwarzschild metric, of non-zero value in Vaidya approach also outside
a body allowing thus to localize the gravitational energy density) in the
form

dm
dt
where m is the mass of a body, G (6.67259 × 10−11 kg−1 m3 s−2) is
the gravitational constant, r is the distance from the body, rg is the
gravitational radius of the body, f(m) is an arbitrary function, and Ψis
deﬁned [3] as

Applying Vaidya metric and stemming from Robertson-Walker approach,
Friedmann equations can be then written in the form [10]

where ε is the critical energy density (the Universe actual density within the
ENU model) and p is the pressure. Based on (9) and (10) it follows

Equations (11) and (12) represent the matter creation and the negative

value of gravitational energy, respectively (for more details, see [2 - 4]).

Applying Vaidya metric to one body (a system with the mass m), a
distance dependence of the gravitational ﬁeld density εg created by this body
obeys relation (13) in the weak ﬁeld condition

εg = −

= −

R c4
8 π G

3 m c2
4 π rU r2

The absolute value of the gravitational ﬁeld density of a system equals to the
critical density at the distance ref (eﬀective interaction range of its gravita-
tional force). Comparison of the relations (4), (11) and (13) leads to

ref = (rg rU )1/2 = (2 Ψ rU )1/2

in which rg means the gravitational radius of a body with the mass m.

Vaidya metric may be applied in all cases for which the gravitational

energy is localizable, i.e. in cases being governed by relation (15)

Gravitational inﬂuence can be thus actually realized only if the absolute value
of the gravitational energy density created by a body exceeds the critical
energy density, i.e. the mean gravitational energy density of the Universe. If

r < ref

r ≥ ref

Vaidya metric adopts the form of Schwarzschild metric preventing the energy
of gravitational ﬁeld from localization.

A typical feature of the ENU model lies in its simplicity, in fact that
no “additional parameters” or strange “dark energy” are needed, and in the
usage of only one state equation in describing the Universe.

3 Yukawa potential and our solar system

The potential bearing Yukawa name was introduced into physics in 1935 in
connection with prediction of mesons [11]. Originally it was formulated in
the form

Eoro
r
where Ep(r) is the nuclear potential energy between two nucleons at the dis-
tance r, ro is the range of the nuclear forces, Eo is the strength of the inter-
action. A similar potential was, however, formulated some years earlier by
Neumann and Seeliger when describing gravitational interactions.

exp(−r/ro)

Ep(r) = −

(17)

Later on, the Yukawa potential demonstrated its importance in solving
various issues of particle physics and penetrated into chemistry, mainly in
rationalization of liquid-vapour equilibrium, monomer-dimer mixtures be-
haviour, etc. [12–14].

Reevaluating Einstein equations, Zhuck highlighted the importance of the
Yukawa potential for the Universe understanding and manifested its impor-
tance for the gravity forces in his recent paper paper [15].

In this paper the Yukawa-type gravitational potential is discussed from
the viewpoint of its applicability for a single body and, more generally, for
any system with deﬁned dimensions such as a galaxy, supercluster, etc.).
Diﬀerences emerging from application of the Newtonian and Yukawa poten-
tials are exempliﬁed by our solar system, eliptic galaxies and super clusters
parameters. The discussion is held in the framework of the Expansive Non-
decelerative Universe model (ENU).

Taking Vaidya metric into account, the non-relativistic gravitational po-

tential outside a body with the mass m can be expressed in the form

where

Φ = Φo exp(−r/ref )

Φo = −G

dV = −

G m
r

(18)

(19)

It follows both from the Zhuck [15] and our approaches that consequences of
the potential, i.e. diﬀerences between results provided using the Newtonian
and Yukawa potentials can actually be observed only taking suﬃciently large
distances r into account. We have chosen our solar system (its the most
distant planets - Neptun and Pluto), and eliptic galaxies as examples. The
results obtained enable us to estimate the amount of dark matter in the
investigated galaxies and in the whole Universe.

The Sun mass is [16]

which represents 99.866% of the mass of the whole solar system, mSS, being

m(Sun) = 1.9891 × 1030kg

m(SS)

∼= 1.9918 × 1030kg

The eﬀective interaction range of the solar system ref (SS) based on (14) and
(21) is as follows

ref (SS)

∼= 6.43 × 1014m

A mean square of velocity of the planets revolution can be expressed, the
Yukawa potential including, as

¯v2 =

t2 =

Gm(SS)
¯r

exp(−¯r/ref )

of which

− ref ln

4π2 ¯r3
G m(SS) t2 = ¯r

where t is the orbital period of a planet around the Sun, ¯r is a mean Sun-to-
planet distance. Relations (21), (22), (24), and known t for Neptun lead to
the following ENU-based value

¯r(N eptun)EN U = 4.488 × 1012m

Calculation based on the Newtonian potential gives
¯r(N eptun)N P = 4.496 × 1012m

Diﬀerence of both the values is about 0.2%. A similar treatment for Pluto
leads to

4 The Universe dark matter estimation

Generally, the more massive gravitationally bonded structure, the lower its
energy density. It can be supposed that for superclusters or giant clusters of
galaxies, their energy density approaches the critical density. It means that
dimension of such systems is

r ∼= ref
Consequently, the total mass of such systems dark, matter including, may be
determined directly from their dimensions. Based on (14) and (29) it follows

(29)

The observable mass of the most massive, up-to-now known eliptic galaxies
reaches

and their dimensions are about

Stemming from (30) and (32) the total mass of such galaxies, dark matter
including, represents

An observable mass of an average-sized super cluster is

and its dimension is about

Based on (30), the total mass of a super cluster reaches

m(Galaxy,total)

∼=

2 G rU

m(Galaxy,obs) ≈ 1013m(Sun)

r ∼= ref

∼= 1.56 × 1022m

m(Galaxy,total) ≈ 1015m(Sun)

m(SC,obs) ≈ 1016m(Sun)

r(SC)

∼= ref

∼= 7.1 × 1023m

m(SC,total) ≈ 1018m(Sun)

7

which directly leads, comparing the values mentioned in (33) and (36), to a
result that the total mass exceeds by about two orders the ”visible” mass,
i.e. the majority of the total matter is hidden in the form of dark matter.

Based on validity of (29), relations (23) and (30) provide the rotational

velocity of super cluster (SC) and giant eliptic galaxies (EG)

Provided that the dimensions (radius) of gravitationally bonded systems -
super clusters and giant eliptic galaxies - are known, and including the gauge
factor rU value into account, values of their rotational velocity emerge

The above mentioned ENU-based calculated values are in good accordance
with those experimentally observed.

5 Breaking electron-cation radiation of the

F2 layer of ionosphere

The F2 layer is part of the Earth ionosphere formed predominantly by atomic
ogyxen cations and electrons (the concentration and kind of neutral molecules,
a degree of ionization and temperature depend on several factors, the most
important being solar radiation intensity, season of the year, etc.) [17, 18].
Our attention will be focused on the electrons present in the F2 layer.

The eﬀective cross section dσ related to the emission of a photon (brems-
strahlung, i.e. breaking radiation) in the frequency interval d(¯hω) by an
electron in the ﬁeld of a cation with the charge Z e is deﬁned by Bethe-
Heitler formula [19, 20]

where α is the ﬁne structure constant, me, re, Ee are the electron mass,
radius, and kinetic energy, respectively.

The radiation output of a plasma volume unit is obtained by multiplying
the photon energy ¯hω with the current density of electrons ne colliding with
cations having the density ni. In a limiting case of the total one-electron

ionization (a state not far from the actual state approached at favourite
atmospheric conditions), Z = 1, ne = ni = n, and

At integration of (40) the following substitution is applied

dI(ω) = n2¯hω v dσ

2 Ee = ¯hω (1 + chx)

Then, based on (40) to (42), the total radiation output of a plasma volume
unit at the electron-cation collisions is given as

It is generally accepted that the F2 layer peaks at about 2×1012 e−/m3 during
the day and 5 × 1010e−/m3 during the night. The electron temperature is
widely spread in the range of 1000 K to 3000 K. On the other hands, for
the cations, the temperature covers 800 K to 1500 K. The pressure in this
region ranges between 10−5 − 10−6 Pa and the ionic mean free path is 4.5 to
15 km. Accordingly, the ionospheric plasma can be considered as a highly
ionized, almost collisionless gas in the F2 region [18]. Based on the above
values and relation (43), the total output of the breaking radiation in a
volume unit of the F2 layer reaches (in the calculation, limiting conditions of
the temperature interval from 1000 K to 3000 K, and electron concentration
from 1 × 1012 e−/m3 to 2 × 1012 e−/m3 were taken)

I(ei) = 4.9 × 10−15 − 3.3 × 10−14W/m

Gravitational output is in the ENU deﬁned as

Taking the concentration of oxygen cations in a volume unit of the F2 layer,
|Pg| = 5.0 × 10−15 − 1.0 × 10−14W/m

(47)

Thus, during the daytime, the gravitational output approaches the breaking
radiation output (intervals of the outputs overlaps, as shown by (45) and
(47)).

6 Cyclotron radiation of the Sun surface

The mass density at the Sun surface is about

which corresponds to particle concentration

at the Sun surface temperature

ρ ∼= 1kg/m3

n ≈ 1027m−3

T ∼= 5.8 × 103K

At these conditions (further, for calculation purposes, the value expressed in
(48) is taken as an exact value), the ionization degree is

which leads to the concentration of free electrons

χ = 1.161 × 10−6

n(e) = 1.161 × 1021m−3

At such conditions the Debye-H¨uckel radius is still higher than the mean
ion-ion distance, i.e. the kinetic energy of the present particles exceeds elec-
tromagnetic Coulomb energy of the ions.

Owing to the relatively great mass of the present cations, their cyclotron
radiation may be omitted. Breaking electron-cation and electron-electron ra-
diation (bremsstrahlung [19]) is due to a high cation concentration extremely
high.

The above results, namely very closed values of (61) and (64) allow us to
formulate a conclusion stating that the cyclotron and gravitational output of
a volume unit of the plasma forming the Sun surface are (almost) identical
which may have an eﬀect on the Sun corona heating.

At the end of radiation era, the concentration of ions was very low and, con-
sequently, the eﬀect of breaking electron-ion and electron-electron radiation
may be omitted. This part will be devoted and limited to cyclotron radia-
tion only. Stemming from the identity of (56) and (69), introduction of the

ation era, the electron emitted identical amounts of the cyclotron radiation
and gravitational energy.
It should be pointed out that the gravitational

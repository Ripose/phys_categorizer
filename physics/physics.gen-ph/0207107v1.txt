Abstract:

It was demonstrated recently[1] that the correct mathematical expression for
the total energy H of a particle is H = mv2, where m is the relativistic
mass and v is the velocity; not H = mc2 as was widely believed.
In this
paper, the equation H = mv2 will be used to calculate the energy levels in
the spectrum of the hydrogen atom. It is demonstrated that the well-known
Sommerfeld-Dirac formula is still obtained, but without the constant term
m0c2 that was originally present in the formula.

1 Introduction:

In an earlier work by the author[1] it was demonstrated that a total energy
equation that will satisfy the Compton-de Broglie wave mechanics as well as
the theory of special relativity will be the equation H = mv2 (where H is the
total energy of a particle, m is its relativistic mass, and v is its velocity); not
the equation H = mc2 as was widely accepted. In this paper, we will seek to
calculate the ﬁne structure of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, using the
equation H = mv2.

According to the improved relativistic model of the atom advanced by the
theories of Sommerfeld[2] and Dirac[3], the energy levels in the spectrum of
the hydrogen atom were found to be in agreement with the following approx-
imate equation

where n is the principal quantum number, k is the second (or Sommerfeld’s)
quantum number, and α is Sommerfeld’s ﬁne structure constant. As it is well
recognized, this equation describes the ﬁne structure accurately, except for
the Lamb shift[5],[6]. The constant term m0c2 present in the equation, though
it was not present in the original theory of Bohr, does not of course aﬀect the
observed energy levels since it is canceled when the diﬀerence W1
W2 be-
tween any two levels is taken. In the following sections we will demonstrate,
by using the total energy equation H = mv2, that Eq.(1) is still obtained
except for the constant term m0c2. Even though the analysis is still fully
relativistic, the absence of the term m0c2 makes the ﬁnal equation essentially
an improved version of the original equation derived by Bohr.

We have two alternatives in proceeding with this analysis: we can either
use the simple and elegant geometric approach developed by Sommerfeld, or
use the Hamiltonian approach developed by Dirac. We will opt for the sec-
ond choice for one simple reason: Dirac’s analysis did depend on Einstein’s
total energy formula H = mc2. It is therefore very important to examine
how the analysis and hence the ﬁnal result will be shaped when the total

2

energy is taken to be H = mv2 instead. In the analysis, we will of course
assume a heavy, spinless nucleus and no radiative corrections. We will also
follow the standard practice of assigning the symbol “e2” as a shorthand for
the quantity e2/4πǫ0 that appears in Coulomb’s law (where e is the electron’s
charge).

2 The relationship between the equation H =

mv2 and Bohr’s model of the atom:

Apart from the relativistic mechanics, the equation H = mv2 has a very
strong relationship with the classical mechanics used by Bohr in his model
of the atom. It is important to understand this relationship before we pro-
ceed with a Hamiltonian-based analysis. In Bohr’s model of the atom, the
electron’s kinetic and potential energies are both equal to zero at an inﬁnite
distance from the nucleus. As the electron moves closer to the nucleus, it
loses potential energy and hence this quantity becomes negative. This quan-
e2/R in the
tity is deﬁned by Coulomb’s law and is numerically equal to
case of the hydrogen atom, where R is the orbit’s radius. There is, however,
an alternative way to obtain a mathematical expression that represents the
same quantity. Since a free electron traveling with a linear velocity v at an
inﬁnite distance from the nucleus must have a total energy equal to mv2,
then the principle of conservation of energy implies that a bound electron
traveling with the same velocity v must have a potential energy equal to
mv2 (the amount of energy required to free the electron must be equal to
−
the total energy available from the free particle).
It is not diﬃcult to see
that this simple result is in perfect agreement with the classical mechanics in
Bohr’s theory: classically, the electron is in equilibrium due to the equality
of the two forces

where e2/R2 is the Coulomb electrostatic force and mv2/R is the centrifugal
e2/R, or the potential energy, is
force. It is now obvious that the quantity

diately apparent: ﬁrst, given that the potential energy is numerically equal
mv2, then the total energy of a bound electron must be equal to zero;
to
secondly, it will be obvious that the equation H = mv2, while fully in agree-
ment with the theories of special relativity and wave mechanics, it is also
fully distinguishable from the classical theory of Bohr.

It is now important to understand how -given that H = 0- the spectral lines
of the atom are obtained. Since exciting an atom means applying a certain
amount of external work to the electron, then the “observable” energy, that
is, the energy that can be transferred to/from the atom, must be equal to
the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. This was the assumption that
was used by Bohr and later Sommerfeld and Dirac. We will also preserve the
same principle here. We will refer to that observable energy as W . It was
demonstrated in the earlier paper by the author[1] that the kinetic energy of
a particle is given by the following relativistic expression:

The fact that W is a negative quantity is, of course, not new. What is new
here is that W is numerically equal to the electron’s mass-energy quantity!
This result has an important physical meaning: for a bound electron, what is
classically referred to as the “sum of kinetic and potential energies” is, from a
relativistic point of view, a quantity that actually represents the mass-energy
of the particle. To understand it diﬀerently, if we consider the atom to be
a “system” that is capable of storing energy, then any excitation energy ap-
plied to that system will be stored in the form of additional mass-energy of
the moving particle, that is, the electron. It is important to observe that this
conclusion correlates strongly with the principles of wave mechanics, since

4

classical quantities such as “kinetic energy” and “potential energy” have no
equivalent in wave mechanics. Now, mathematically, this result means that
while the total energy of the electron -as a standalone particle- is zero, the
energy stored in the system, that is, the atom, is diﬀerent from zero.

The only unknown in Eq.(4) is of course the velocity v. We shall now pro-
ceed to calculate v, using the Hamiltonian technique developed by Dirac. We
will then be able to write a formula for the observable energy W in terms of
quantum numbers.

3 The energy level W based on the Hamilto-

nian analysis:

We will begin by considering the Hamiltonian of a free particle, obtained in
the earlier paper[1]:

~H =

~pr [βr],

where ~pr is a vectorized one-dimensional momentum component, [βr] is a
Dirac matrix, and r = 1, 2, 3, 4. For a bound electron, we just add the
mv2 then
e2/R to the Hamiltonian. But since
potential energy
H = 0 as we indicated, and hence the eigenvalues of ~H are also zeros. We
can therefore write the following scalar equation

Here, ψa and ψb represent two diﬀerent radial wave functions of the electron.

We will assume, along with Dirac, that the ﬁrst term in the wave function
power series starts with the power s0, so that the sum of the coeﬃcients
of Rs0−1 in the above equations must be equal to zero. By selecting the
coeﬃcients of Rs0−1 we therefore get the following two equations:

If we now multiply the respective terms on each side of these two equations,
while allowing for a diﬀerent choice of the signs of α and k in each equation,
we get

The relationship between α and the power s has an important physical mean-
ing. α is a function of the velocity of the electron, while the equations (15)
represent spherical harmonics in which increasing powers (that is, increasing
s) correspond to diﬀerent electron positions (i.e., increasing s correspond to
increasing n, or the principal quantum number). We must therefore put αs
instead of α in those two equations, since α will be a variable in those spher-
ical harmonics, given of course the fact that the velocity will be a function
of the position, or the principal quantum number. For the power s0, which
is the ﬁrst term in the series, we shall designate the symbol α0 as the value
of α that corresponds to that term. Eq.(19) is therefore written as

We next turn to the following question: what is the numerical value of α0 ?
The answer is in fact quite simple. Since α = e2/¯hv, and since the power s0
corresponds to the very ﬁrst term in the spherical harmonic series, a term
which in turn corresponds to a position of the electron that is the lowest

value, or c. α0 will then be given by

α0 =

e2
¯hc

.

We should now recognize that α0 is actually Sommerfeld’s ﬁne-structure con-
stant. The next step is to determine the value of αs when the power s is at
a maximum, which corresponds to the last term in the series and hence the
actual position of the electron. In Eqs.(15), the coeﬃcients Cs and C ′
s must
both tend to zero if the series is to converge for a certain value of s. If we
now select the powers of Rs−1 in the two equations and let Cs ≈
0, we
get the following single equation

s ≈

C ′

αs =

(s

k)

We now have the following restrictions on the three quantities αs, s and k:
all three are positive quantities; k
s; s must be larger than the principal
quantum number n; and ﬁnally αs cannot be much larger n or otherwise the
velocity v will deviate strongly from the prediction of the classical theory.
These restrictions immediately lead to the conclusion that the only possible
solution for Eq.(22) is αs = (s
k). We ﬁnally let s = n + s0, as Dirac had
proposed. The quantity αs will therefore be given by

The only diﬀerence between this equation and Eq.(1) is the absence of the
constant term m0c2. As we indicated earlier, that constant term does not play
any role in the Sommerfeld-Dirac theories and does not aﬀect the observable
energy levels. It is also interesting to note that Bohr’s energy level equation

and hence Eq.(26) can be essentially regarded as an improved version of

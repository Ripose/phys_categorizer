Crater Property in Two-Particle Bound States: When and Why

(January 13, 2014)

Crater has shown that, for two particles (with masses m1 and m2) in a Coulombic bound state,
the charge distribution is equal to the sum of the two charge distributions obtained by taking
m1 → ∞ and m2 → ∞ respectively, while keeping the same Coulombic potential. We provide a
simple scaling criterion to determine whether an arbitrary Hamiltonian possesses this property. In
particular we show that, for a Coulombic system, ﬁne structure corrections preserve this Crater
property while two-particle relativistic corrections and/or hyperﬁne corrections may destroy it.

Recently, in an interesting paper in this journal [1], Crater discussed an unusual feature of charge densities for
two-particle Coulombic bound states. Let ρ(R; m1, m2) be the charge density of a two-particle bound state in a given
potential V (r) ≡ V (r1 − r2) in the center-of-mass coordinate system. Then Crater observed that, for a Coulombic
potential the charge density satisﬁes the following relation:

ρ(R; m1, m2) = lim

ρ(R; m1, m2) + lim

ρ(R; m1, m2),

m2→∞

m1→∞

(1)

or, in Crater’s own words, one can picture ρ(R; m1, m2) “as equivalent to that produced by a particle of mass m1 and
charge e1, bound to a ﬁxed center with charge e2 plus that produced by a particle of mass m2 and charge e2, bound
to a ﬁxed center with charge e1,” with the ﬁxed center being the center of mass. Here and after this property will be
referred to as the Crater property. Crater has shown in Ref. [1] that the Crater property holds for Coulombic potentials
but not for generic potentials. In the real world, however, Coulombic potentials are often corrected by perturbations
like ﬁne/hyperﬁne structures and relativistic eﬀects. It would be of interest to know what kind of corrections can be
added to the Coulombic potential without destroying the Crater property. More generally, we would like to have a
criterion to determine whether a given potential has the Crater property without explicitly solving the Schr¨odinger
equation. The purpose of this paper is to provide answers to these questions.

Let us consider an eigenfunction ψ(r; m1, m2) to the Schr¨odinger equation (in units ¯h = 1):

H(m1, m2)ψ(r; m1, m2) ≡

+ V (r; m1, m2)

ψ(r; m1, m2) = E(m1, m2)ψ(r; m1, m2),

with µ = m1m2/M and M = m1 + m2. The charge density operator ˆρ(R) is deﬁned as [1]

ˆρ(R) = e1δ3(R − r1) + e2δ3(R − r2),

and the charge density ρ(R; m1, m2) is its expectation value, which can easily be shown to be

where the rescaled eigenfunction ˜ψ(r; m1, m2) is a dimensionless function. Now consider the case when ˜ψ(r; m1, m2)
has the following form:

ψ(r; m1, m2) = µ3/2 ˜ψ(r; m1, m2),

˜ψ(r; m1, m2) ≡ ˜ψ(µr),

which states that the dependences of ˜ψ on the location r and the masses m1,2 always come through the combination
µr = m1m2r/(m1 + m2). Then ψ(r; m1, m2) = µ3/2 ˜ψ(µr) and the charge density ρ(R; m1, m2) in Eq. (4) becomes

which is exactly the expression for the Crater property. In other words, the charge density exhibits the Crater property
whenever the eigenfunction can be written as µ3/2 ˜ψ(µr).

It is easy to translate the above scaling condition on the eigenfunction to a corresponding scaling condition on
the Hamiltonian. Since the Hamiltonian H(m1, m2) carries scaling dimension [mass]1, it can always be rewritten as
µ ˜H(m1, m2), where ˜H is a dimensionless function of m1,2, as well as the relative coordinates r and the canonical
momenta −i∂/∂r. It is straightforward to see that ˜ψ is a function of solely µr if and only if

˜H(m1, m2) = ˜H

such that, up to an additive constant, the masses enter the Hamiltonian only through combinations µr and
−i(∂/∂(µr)). The dimensionless constant ˜V0, which may have arbitrary dependences on m1,2, may shift the eigenvalues
but does not aﬀect the eigenfunctions.

We have shown that the charge density of an eigenfunction exhibits the Crater property if and only if the Hamiltonian

can be written as

which will be referred to as the scaling criterion. With this criterion one can easily determine if a particular potential
exhibits the Crater property. For spinless Schr¨odinger systems, the kinetic term always satisﬁes the scaling criterion.

On the other hand, for analytic V (r)’s one can expand them in Laurent series and the scaling criterion is satisﬁed if
and only if

where ak are mass independent coeﬃcients. Of special interest is the case where the only non-vanishing ak are those
with k = −1 and −2:

which describes a Coulombic potential in three dimensions with a−1 = e1e2 and a−2 = ℓ(ℓ + 1)/2, i.e., the case studied
in Ref. [1]. Another interesting case is the “two-dimensional Coulombic potential”, i.e., the logarithmic potential:

V (r) = e1e2 ln(r/r0) = e1e2 [ln(µr) − ln(µr0)] ,

which can be seen to satisfy the scaling criterion by identifying the second term as ˜V0.

As pointed out in Ref. [1], the Crater property is not a feature of potentials of generic r and mass dependences.
Crater illustrated this point by studying the eigenfunctions of a simple harmonic potential and showed explicitly that
ρ(R; m1, m2), given by Eq. (4), is not the sum of limm2→∞ ρ(R; m1, m2) and limm1→∞ ρ(R; m1, m2), i.e., the simple
harmonic potential does not exhibit the Crater property. On the other hand, we can reproduce the same conclusion
by just studying the scaling behavior of the simple harmonic potential:

which cannot be recast in a form conforming to criterion (9). As a result, the Crater property is not exhibited in
simple harmonic potentials.

It is of interest to note that, for any potential V (r) = µ ˜V (µr) satisfying the scaling criterion, including the ﬁne

structure corrections does not destroy the Crater property.

where Hmv, HSO, and HD stand for the relativistic mass variation term, the spin-orbit coupling term and the Darwin

where α and β are the Dirac matrices. Since this one-particle Dirac Hamiltonian also satisﬁes the scaling criterion,
the Crater property is preserved.

However, it is important to bear in mind that it is an approximation to describe a two-particle bound state by a
one-particle Schr¨odinger or Dirac equation. Take, for example, the hyperﬁne correction, which for a Coulombic bound
state is

and the scaling criterion is violated by the outstanding factor of µ/M , where M = m1 + m2 is the total mass.
Violations of the scaling criterion may also be due to two-particle relativistic eﬀects. In the non-relativistic theory
a two-particle problem can always be reduced to an eﬀective one-particle problem in the relative coordinates, which
decouple with the center-of-mass coordinates in the kinetic term:

where R is the center of mass position m1r1 + m2r2, and r is the relative position r1 − r2. For a relativistic theory
in general no such decomposition is possible, and the description of a two-particle problem by a one-particle equation
is a good approximation only when one particle is much heavier than the other. Such treatments do not capture
genuine two-particle eﬀects, like the two-particle relativistic corrections and hyperﬁne corrections. These corrections
in general do not satisfy the scaling criterion and one expects the Crater property to be violated by these corrections.
In passing, we note that the notion of Crater property can be generalized in a straightforward manner to any

operator of the following form:

O(R) = a δ3(R − r1) + b δ3(R − r2),

(21)

where a and b are arbitrary coeﬃcients. This operator (R) may correspond to physically interesting objects for
particular choices of a and b; it is the charge density when (a, b) = (e1, e2), the probability density of particle
1 and 2 when (a, b) = (1, 0) and (0, 1), respectively, and the mass density when (a, b) = (m1, m2). Then the
Hamiltonian or potential is said to exhibit the Crater property of charge/probability/mass distribution if and only if
the charge/probability/mass distribution in the bound state of particle mass m1 and m2 is equivalent to the sum of
the charge/probability/mass distributions produced in the limits m1 → ∞ and m2 → ∞. As before, all these Crater
properties are guaranteed by the same scaling criterion (9).

In conclusion, we have provided a simple criterion to determine if the eigenfunctions of a given Hamiltonian have
the Crater property. In particular, we have shown that neither the inclusions of ﬁne structure corrections nor the
switching from Schr¨odinger to Dirac formalism will destroy the Crater property. The author believes Crater must have
foreseen the essential points of this paper — as in the conclusion of Ref. [1] he stated that “in general, the appearance
of parameters in the potentials that are not dimensionless (in natural units) and do not depend on the reduced mass
would not be of the correct type.” As a consequence, this paper may be regarded as a concrete realization of this
observation.

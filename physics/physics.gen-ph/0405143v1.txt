Energy conservation laws in classical electrodynamics

There are three electromagnetic integrals of motion that can be interpreted as the energy. These
are the background energy, the elastic energy and the integral in the torsion ﬁeld commonly referred
to as the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The integral in the torsion ﬁeld gains the meaning of
the energy insomuch as it is concerned with the mechanical energy of a charged particle.

INTRODUCTION. THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

We will consider equations for electromagnetic potentials

∂t

+ E + ∇ϕ = 0,

c
∇ · E = 4πqδ(x − x′

),

∂E
∂t

− ∇ × (∇ × A) + 4πqvδ(x − x′

) = 0.

The consideration will be restricted to the Coulomb gauge

∇ · A = 0.

We will ﬁnd three integrals of equations (1) − (4) that can be interpreted as the energy. This enables us to elucidate
the concept of the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Summation over recurrent index is implied throughout.

2. THE BACKGROUND ENERGY

Following [1] we express the vector ﬁeld E via some tensor ﬁeld ηik:

Ei = κ

∂ηik
∂xk

,

where κ is an arbitrary constant. Then (3) can be obtained convolving equation

In derivation of (3) from (6) we used (5), (4) and following relations

Taking in (6) i = k and summing over the repeated index we get with the account of (4)

∇(∇·) = ∇2 + ∇ × (∇×),
= − 4πδ(x − x′

).

Substituting (12) and (13) into (1) we have by virtue of (2) and (4)

Multiplying (14) by ∂s/∂t, integrating over the space and taking the second integral by parts we get

This integral of motion is interpreted in the mechanical analogy [2] as the elastic energy of a substratum.

4. CONSERVATION IN THE TORSION FIELD

Taking the curl of (14)

Multiplying (17) by ∂(∇ × s)/∂t, integrating over the space and taking the second integral by parts we get

Substituting (14) and then (12) into expression (18) we convert it into the electromagnetic form

5. THE ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY

We will consider two charged particles. Forms (2) and (3) are speciﬁed by

∇ · E = 4πq1δ(x − x(1)) + 4πq2δ(x − x(2)),

− ∇ × (∇ × A) + 4πq1v(1)δ(x − x(1)) + 4πq2v(2)δ(x − x(2)) = 0.

The motion of the particles can be described by equations

Let us derive an integral of motion that is concerned with the mechanical energy of the particles. Multiply (21) by
E, then substitute (1) into the second term. Integrate all over the space and take the second integral by parts. This
gives

8π Z

[E2 + (∇ × A)2]d3x + q1v(1) · E(x(1)) + q2v(2) · E(x(2)) = 0.

(24)

Substitute (22) and (23) into (24). Also for our convenience we use (1) in the ﬁrst term of the expression under the
integral. Thus we get

The ﬁrst term in (25) is commonly interpreted as the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. However, comparing (25)
with (19) we see that (25) generalizes the integral of motion in the torsion ﬁeld of the displacement.

The electromagnetic unteraction has no relation to the background energy nor to the elastic energy. It is concerned

with a conservation law in the torsion ﬁeld of a substratum.

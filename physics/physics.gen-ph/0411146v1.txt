Abstract

It is considered the electromagnetic wave in the frame moving transverse to
the wave. Due to the velocity of the frame with respect to a preferred reference
frame the oscillations of phase arise. The oscillations of phase yield the third order
eﬀect which can be seen in the Michelson-Morley experiment. The eﬀect due to
the velocity of the earth with respect to CMB is in agreement with the anisotropy
determined in the Michelson-Morley experiment.

Consider the plane monochromatic electromagnetic wave. Let the wave vector k be
directed along the axis x, the electric ﬁeld E along the axis y, the magnetic ﬁeld H
along the axis z. Suppose that the invariance of the velocity of light holds true. Let the
emitter and receiver of the electromagnetic wave be situated in the frame moving with
the velocity v with respect to a preferred reference frame. We shall take the frame of
the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) as a preferred reference frame. Let,
the velocity v be transverse to the electromagnetic wave, e.g. the velocity v be in the z
direction. Due to the velocity of the frame an additional magnetic ﬁeld in the x direction
arises

phase oscillations

Due to the eﬀective velocity of light the second order phase oscillations yield the third
order eﬀect average for the period v3/2c3. An observer can detect such a phase shift of
the third order with the Michelson-Morley interferometer.

Observations [1] tell us that the earth moves with the velocity, vCM B = 369 km/s, in
the direction, (α, δ) = (11.20h, −7.220), with respect to CMB. Due to the eﬀect under
consideration the velocity of the earth with respect to CMB can be seen as a third order
eﬀect v3
CM B/2c3 in the Michelson-Morley experiment. When changing the angle between
vCM B and c, one can detect the anisotropy of the phase shift in the Michelson-Morley
experiment.

M¨uller et al. [2] reported the results of the modern Michelson-Morley experiment.
Within the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl test theory [3], they obtained the isotropy violation
parameter, B = −2.2±1.5×10−9. The obtained isotropy violation parameter corresponds
to the phase shift, (−B/4)(1 + cos2 χ) cos2 δ = 8.4 ± 5.7 × 10−10, where χ = 42.30 is the
latitude of the set up, δ = −7.220 is the declination of vCM B. For the Michelson-Morley
experiment, the eﬀect under consideration yields the maximum anisotropy of the phase
CM B/2c3 = 9.3 × 10−10, that is in agreement with the experimental value.
shift, v3

In summary, we have considered the phase shift of the electromagnetic wave in the
frame moving transverse to the wave. Due to the velocity of the earth with respect to CMB
CM B/2c3, which
the eﬀect under consideration yields the anisotropy of the phase shift, v3
can be seen in the Michelson-Morley experiment. The predicted value is in agreement
with the anisotropy determined in the Michelson-Morley experiment.

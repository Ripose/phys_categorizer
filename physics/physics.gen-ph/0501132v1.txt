Abstract

The geometry of the elementary charge is studied in the framework of the
concept of space considered as a tessellation lattice (’tessellattice’), which has
recently been developed by M. Bounias and the author. The descriptive-geometric
sense of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and their carriers – photons – is analyzed.
The notion of the scalar and vector potentials of a charged particle and their
behavior at the motion of the particle along its path is investigated in detail.
Based on the potentials, the Lagrangian leading to the Maxwell equations is
constructed. The distinctive properties of the inerton and the photon – two basic
elementary excitations, or quasi-particles of the space tessellattice – are discussed.
Summarizing, we may say that the work suggests the detailed interpretation of
the Maxwell equations in terms of the submicroscopic approach to Nature.

1. INTRODUCTION

A very abstract and formal nature of modern schemes of geometrization of
fundamental physical interactions is a matter of common knowledge. Among
such kinds of approaches there are schemes of grand uniﬁcation of electromag-
netic, weak and strong interactions, theories of string, superstring and supergrav-
ity, etc. In these theories the description of sources of ﬁelds – the mass and the
electric charge – is realized by means of abstract classical or wave ﬁelds of an
indeterminate nature (but fundamental as are suggested!) with a respective sta-
tistical interpretation. One points out here only some of the approaches [1-8]. A
mathematical model (ﬁeld presentation) of a single photon as a real ﬁnite object
has been developed in papers [9]. We should point out an interesting model by
Hofer [10] aimed at the description of the electromagnetic ﬁeld to so-called natural
units in the framework of which the electric ﬁeld and the vector potential change
their dimensionality to typical mechanical units. Recently, models of charged
particles that are characterized by appropriate electromagnetic clouds, Bagan et
al. [11], or clouds of soft photons, Greenberg [12], have been proposed; in those
models infrared divergences disappear just due to the original dressing of parti-
cles. Todorov [13] treated electrical charges as something that followed from the
gauge-invariant Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations. Regarding the further inves-
tigation of the Maxwell equations we may point out in particular an approach by
Drummond [14] aimed at interchanging the magnetic and electric variables and
the formation of the common complex variable.

However, it must be emphasized that the mentioned models and all other ones
of quantum electrodynamics determine photons and consider their interaction
with particles only in abstract phase spaces such as the momentum one, but not
in the real space.

At the same time the structure of the real physical space considered as a
structured vacuum, a quantum aether, or a space net on the background of which
all physical processes take place has come under the scrutiny of science in the last
decade (see, e.g. Refs.
[15-20]). Speciﬁcally, in the author’s works [19-23] there
have been developed a concept that makes it possible to look at the notion of mass

2

and the motion of a massive particle from the other viewpoint that fundamentally
diﬀers from standard ﬁeld approaches. The further development has allowed the
deriving the macroscopic gravitation from submicroscopic ﬁrst principles [24,25].
It turned out that the author’s approach was in excellent agreement with the
pure mathematical research of the construction of space carried out by Bounias
and Bonaly [26], and Bounias [27]. This allowed M. Bounias and the author joined
forces in order to develop founding principles about mathematical constitution of
space [28] and then to construct the physical space, i.e.
to derive matter and
physics laws from the constitution of space and combination rules permissible
by the space [29]. In these works we start from set theory, topology and fractal
geometry and has shown that the real space-time is characterized by a topo-
logically discrete structure. An abstract lattice of empty set cells accounts for a
primary substrate in the real physical space. Space-time is represented by ordered
sequences of topologically closed Poincar´e sections of this primary space with a
lattice structure called the ’tessellattice’. The interaction of a moving particle-like
deformed cell with the surrounding tessellattice involves a fractal decomposition
process that supports the existence and properties of previously postulated inerton
clouds as associated to particles.

We have shown [29,30] that if a deformation of primary cells involves a fractal
transformation to objects, there occurs an alteration in the dimensionality of the
cell(s) and the homeomorphism is not conserved. In this event the fractal kernel
stands for a particle state and the reduction of the corresponding volume of the
cell is compensated by morphic changes of surrounding cells. The fractality is
speciﬁed by quanta and combination rules [30] that determine oriented sequences
with continuity of set-distance functions providing a space-time-like structure that
facilitates the aggregation of the mentioned deformations into fractal forms stand-
ing for massive objects. An appropriate dilatation of space is induced outside the
aggregation. At a submicroscopic scale the families of fractal deformations pro-
duce families of particle-like structures, but at large scale an apparent expansion
has to occur.

It has been argued [22] that the size of a primary cell of the space tessellattice is
probably on the order of 10−30 m (it is the scale at which, according to the theory
of grand uniﬁcation of interactions, all types of interactions should coincide).
In a ﬂat, or degenerate space all cells, or superparticles, are found in a state

The creation of a mass particle means the change in the initial volume of the

correlative superparticle, i.e.

Vsup passes to the other ﬁxed value

Vpart. A detailed study on
rest mass of the particle is determined as M 0 ∝ Vsup/
the generation of mass in a cell of the tessellattice has been performed in Refs.
[29,30] in which we have shown that the mass of a particle is a function of the
fractal-related decrease of the volume of the cell,

where (e) is the Bouligand exponent, and (e
1) is the gain in dimensionality given
by the fractal iteration. Just the volume decrease is not suﬃcient for providing a
cell with mass, because a dimensional increase is a necessary condition.

−

As has been shown in Ref.

[24], a moving particle constantly exchanges by
v2
0/c2
mass with the particle’s inertons: the inert mass of the particle M0/
is periodically dissociated to M0 (on each odd segment of the particle path λ/2
where λ is the particle’s de Broglie wavelength) and then the particle re-absorbs
inertons (on each even segment λ/2 of the particle path) and its mass is restored
v2
0/c2. Thus gravitons of the general theory of relativity (which are
to M0/
not a realistic solution [31, 32]) give way to inertons.

The existence of inertons was demonstrated in papers [32-34]. Because of that
it is quite reasonable to attempt to extend the author’s concept and study how an
electric charge appears in the canonical elementary particle within the framework
of the space tessellattice and how the charge moves dressed by a cloud of elemen-
tary excitations that carry both inert and electromagnetic properties. Account
must be taken of the fact that the motion of the charge should be coordinated
with all the aspects of electrodynamics. And the ﬁrst step on the road to such
a theory has already been made [35]: the photon allows an interpretation of an
excitation migrated in a discrete space, i.e. the tessellattice.

It is well known that atoms in a crystal, in view of interaction, are found in
the uninterrupted collective motion. When this is the case, each of atoms has as
many non-equivalent wave vectors as there are atoms in the crystal lattice (see,
e.g. Ref. [36]). Let us transfer this property to the space tessellattice, especially
as in Ref. [30] we have shown that topological structures available at elementary
scales can be distributed down to cosmic scales. In particular, this is true for the
topological notion of the charge formed when a quantum of fractal deformations
collapses into one single cell: the concavity may be determined as the negative
charge and the convexity may be deﬁned as the positive charge.

Before going into the further development of topological details pertinent to
the charge construction and its behavior, we ﬁrst of all should construct a simple

4

physical model of the charge in the space tessellattice employing conventional
mathematics. Let us try to do that in the present work.

2. COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR OF SUPERPARTICLES

−

Let N be the quantity of cells (or superparticles, in other words) that the
whole space tessellattice contains. Of course the value of N is inconceivable huge.
Nonetheless it can be roughly estimated. The size of the observed part of the
universe is on the order of 1026 m (see, e.g. Ref. [37]). The superparticle size has
been estimated as 10−30 m. Therefore, N

(1026m)3/(10−30m)3 = 10168.

∼
The availability of direct contact between neighboring superparticles means
that they are characterized by a coupling energy. Such kind of a connection
brings into existence collective vibrations of superparticles and hence each of su-
perparticles is inﬂuenced by remained N
1. The vibration process lies in the
fact that centers of equilibrium positions of superparticles vibrate with ampli-
tudes an (n = 1, N/2) and each of the superparticles takes part in N diﬀerent
vibrations simultaneously. When superparticles are in contact, the volume
Vsup
of a degenerate superparticle should be smaller than the volume
V0 of an abso-
lutely free superparticle, which is reached when the superparticle is removed from
the space tessellattice. Let the rest mass of the superparticle (i.e. degenerate
Msup ∝ V0/
superparticle) in the tessellattice be deﬁned as
In this case
∆
V0) can be called the superparticle’s defect mass
Vsup −
produced by the coupling. To regard space as the zeroth vacuum (in terms of
Msup as a frame of refer-
quantum ﬁeld theory), one needs to consider the mass
ence of all massive excitations including particles. In other words, we may put
Msup = 0 for the ground level and then all masses of quasi-particles and particles
excited in the tessellattice should be count oﬀ from that.
Another kind of vibrations may also be originated in the tessellattice and this
kind of vibrations is not typical for atoms of the crystal lattice. In the presence of
direct contact of the superparticle surfaces one can presuppose that the collective
behavior of these surfaces should occur. According to what has been said, Fig. 1
shows states of vibrations of superparticles in the space tessellattice. In Fig. 1 a
the center of gravity of each elementary cell vibrates at the equilibrium position.
In Fig. 1b the cellular structure is considered as a network and each elementary
link of the network vibrates at its equilibrium position.

takes place along with the conservation of the general area of the superparticle’s
surface. Let

state and in the tessellattice, respectively. Then one can write the relation

where the defect of surface ∆S of the superparticle can probably be found in
the state of a collective motion of fractal elements. The above can schematically
be shown in Fig. 2. Here the defect of surface ∆S consists of the whole set
of fractal elements σn (or amplitudes of the surface vibrations) that cross inside
N
and outside the surface formed by the radius
n=1 σn. It
is precisely these surface vibrations that can be associated with ﬂuctuations of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the electric charge. Indeed the orientation of the
surface amplitudes σn inside of the superparticle (i.e., inside the sphere limited
by the radius
Rsup) we interpreted [29,30] as a quantum of fractal deformations
collapsed into one cell (the negative charge) and the surface amplitudes σn oriented
outside the surface of the superparticle is a quantum of fractal deformations,
which forms the positive charge. Thus we may conjecture that each amplitude
σn oriented inside a superparticle describes the negative element of the electric
ﬁeld and σn oriented outside of a superparticle depicts the positive element of

Rsup, such that ∆S =

neutral. Therefore the sum of the amplitudes oriented towards the inside of the
superparticle surface has to be equal to the sum of the amplitudes oriented towards

a similar relationship is true for the negative charge (i.e., when all amplitudes σn

In particular, formula (3) should be justiﬁed for leptons (e, µ, τ ): with gradual
increase of the mass M e < M µ < M τ , the radius must decrease (R e > R µ > R τ )
and the surface amplitude must increase (σe < σµ < στ ). Transitions of the
superparticle from the free state to the degenerate state in the tessellattice and
then to the state of a particle are schematically shown in Fig. 3.

Let us study the possibility of representing the surface defect ∆S in the form
shown in Fig. 3 c, which can be called the ”chestnut” model. In other words, the
chestnut model means that the particle is presented by a sphere with needles that
stick out (or inside) of the sphere surface.

Let the shape of the surface needle be deﬁned by the ﬁgure of rotation of the

Let us look into the possibility of the extreme of the surface defect (9) that is

It follows from (29) that the surface defect ∆S (25) that generates the elec-
tric charge in a particle is signiﬁcantly smaller as compared with the ground

gravitational properties of the particle. However, on the other hand, the eﬀective
curvature of the needle is considerably greater than that of the ground surface of
the particle. That is why it is logical that the force on the side of needles with

5. ELECTRIC CHARGE AND ITS MOTION

It is obvious that each nth small needle on the sphere surface can be re-
garded as the normal vector to the particle surface. If we designate the normal
dimensionless unit vector as ~u, the combination ~u h 0/h can be interpreted as an
elementary vector of the electric ﬁeld, i.e.

~
E0n = ~u
where the normalized section h plays the role of a ”quantum” of the length of the
needle. The ﬂux Un of the vector ~
0 of the nth
needle base may be written in the form of scalar product

E0n through the surface δsn0 ≡

Then the elementary electric charge ˜e can be determined as the total sum of all

Note that a constancy of the charge ˜e, for instance, for the lepton series, should be
provided by increasing the radius r0 when Rpart decreases: r0e < r0µ < r0τ when
Re > Rµ > Rτ . On the background of the noise the stable polarization of the
”chestnut” (i.e., a quantum of fractal deformations) in the state of rest induces the
same polarization on surrounding superparticles, such that two adjacent super-
particles exhibit opposite forms: one in the sense of convexity and the other in the
sense of concavity (Fig. 5). The neighboring superparticles transmit the particle
polarization to the adjacent superparticles up to the boundary of the crystallite
whose size is deﬁned by the Compton wavelength of the particle λ C = h/M c [21]
and hence the ﬁeld ~
E0n shown in Fig. 5 extends for a distance of the radius λ C
from the particle.
Let us assume that the height of the needle can vary (for example, it can
δh 0). In this case each of the needle
oscillate between magnitudes h 0 and h 0 −
states has its own surface stretched on the same base. Such kind of the needle
motion is potential and hence all states of the needle surface can be described
by a scalar function Φn(h). Then the ﬁeld vector ~
En can be associated with the
h, i.e.
scalar function Φn(h)

Figure 5: Superparticles polarized by the positive charged particle-”chestnut”.
The positive polarization induced in the superparticles is directed outside the
superparticles (needles out); the negative polarization is directed inside the su-
perparticles (needles in).

(so ~

En is a co-vector).
On the other hand, the spike of each nth needle is able to deviate from its
equilibrium position, i.e., the bending of the needle from its axis of symmetry
must not be ruled out. It is obvious that the value of displacement decreases from
the spike to the base of the needle, which is ﬁxed. Therefore this kind of motion
can be related to a vector ﬁeld rather than to a vector that is true only for the
displacement of a separate point. Let us designate this ﬁeld as ~
An.

Let us treat the motion of the ”chestnut” along its spatial trajectory l. The
interaction of a moving particle with superparticles results in a very speciﬁc dy-
namics of the particle along its path [19-23].
In those works we have studied
features associated with the translation motion and the intrinsic motion (i.e., an
asymmetric pulsation of the center-of-mass of a particle). There was no need to
introduce the rotational degree of freedom in our previous papers. However, there
is a good reason to do it now: It is precisely this motion of the charge that the
rotational electric and magnetic ﬁelds generate.

The initial condition is the signiﬁcant characteristic of the motion. In preced-
ing papers [19-23], an initial spatial velocity ~v0 of the particle was regarded as
a main property. The value of v0 described both the translation movement and
the intensity of the proper pulsation of the particle. Besides we assumed that the
velocity v0 was an essential characteristic of the motion of elements of the particle
surface as well. Aside from the value of v0, which has to pose a dynamics for all
the three kinds of degrees of freedom of the particle, the intrinsic motion and the

14

surface motion in addition should have some initial conditions. The direction of
the displacement of the center-of-mass of the particle in relation to the vector ~v0
should ensure the condition for the intrinsic motion (spin), i.e., along or against
~v0. In the case of the surface motion, we may assume that the direction of the
ﬁeld
An of each nth needle is transversal to the vector ~v0. Besides, the vector
~
An can be oriented either to the right or to the left relative to ~v0 (compare with
the photon, a carrier of the electrodynamic ﬁeld, which is characterized by the
transversal polarization, either right or left in relation to its path).

Let us extend the major features of the dynamics of a chargeless particle [19-
23] to the charged one. That is, one can suppose that with the motion of the
”chestnut”, respective magnitudes of the scalar and vector ﬁelds, Φn and ~
An, for
each nth needle oscillate with the period of collisions T in time and with the period
λ in space (here λ = v0T ). Thus with each ith collision of the particle with an in-
going superparticle, the former emits an inerton. With regard for the availability
of the charge state on the superparticle surface, this inerton also carries over a bit
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. [Recall that in solid state physics the mixture of two
diﬀerent quasi-particles in one entity is of frequent occurrence; in particular, com-
posite quasi-particles can be attributed to the polariton (the mixture of light and
polarized optical phonons), the polaritonic exciton (the mixture of the polariton
and exciton), the excitonic polaron (the mixture of the polaron and exciton), etc.]
The pattern of the motion of a charged particle shrouded in its inerton-photon
cloud is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6. The particle emits inerton-photon
quasi-particles that move from superparticle to superparticle by the relay mech-
anism. Within the period Ti of the collision between the particle and the ith
emitted inerton-photon, a part of the velocity vector ~v0i is transmitted from the
particle to the quasi-particle and remains constant in the latter. However, phase
= 0, 1, 2, ...
states of the ith quasi-particle at the moments ti = Tiℵ
designates the order
+ 1)Ti/2 are absolutely diﬀerent [24] (here
and ti = (2
number of the de Broglie section λ in a whole particle path l; this is because the
length of the particle path l is subdivided into a set of sections λ). At the moment
ti = 0, the quasi-particle possesses the inert mass and the electric polarization and
the motion of the center-of-mass and the surface polarization (i.e., the rotation
of the electric ﬁeld) begins from that. At the moment ti = Ti/2, the distance
between the particle and the quasi-particle is equal to Λi and the quasi-particle
does not possess any mass in this point (the mass is transformed here to a local
deformation of the tessellattice as a whole called the ’rugosity’ in Ref. [24]). The
deformation is anisotropic; in this position the quasi-particle’s spin is found in

The same happens to the particle: at the moment t = 0, it is characterized by

by the normal polarization, or fractality of the surface (the electric charge), by
the initial velocity v0 of the intrinsic motion (the motion of center-of-mass) and
by the initial velocity v0 of the motion of the surface polarization. At the moment
t = T /2, the particle is found at rest: its velocity of the translational motion is
equal to zero, the mass equals 0 as well, the center-of-mass is displaced from the
equilibrium position (there is the spin) and the particle surface is speciﬁed by the
axial polarization (i.e., one can see the explicit magnetic charge – the monopole,

An ﬁelds mathematically.
Dimensionality of these ﬁelds conforms to length. Therefore, the corresponding
velocities are ˙Φn and ˙

photon cloud as a whole quasi-particle. Let φn and ~αn be the scalar and vector
ﬁelds, respectively, of the nth eﬀective needle of this quasi-particle; hence the
velocities of the given ﬁelds are ˙φn and ˙~αn. Let us write the Lagrangian density

needle of the cloud. The next to the last and the last terms describe the interaction
between the ﬁelds of the particle and the cloud. In expression (34), the ﬁelds are
diﬀerentiated by the time t that is set as the proper time of the particle, i.e.,
t = l/v0 is a natural parameter, because l is the length of the particle path [20].

6. THE CHARGE IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

Let us examine a ﬂux of free photons, elementary excitations of space, which
carry over scalar and vector polarizations, i.e., the ﬁeld potentials φ and ~α, from
superparticle to superparticle by means of the relay mechanism. Clearly the
motion of the potentials φ and ~α of a free photon along its trajectory is described
by Eqs. (49) and (46), respectively; besides, in this case the velocity v0 should be
replaced by the speed of light c. However, the frequency ν of the phase alteration
of the potentials φ and α is given by a particle or particles, which irradiated
these photons (ν = 1/2T where T is the period of collisions between the particle
cloud of a
and its own inerton-photon cloud [19-21]). The Lagrangian density
free photon has the form of expression (38) in which the following substitutions
should be made: φn →

The elementary charge ˜e is organized by the ﬂux of the gradient of the ﬁeld
Φ of the particle, see formulas (32) and (33), therefore, the charge ˜e can fully

20

interact with external photons, i.e., with the potential φ. Then the term of the
Lagrangian density, which has to describe the interaction, can be taken in the
form

W

where the factor c2/
is introduced to guarantee the dimensionality required, i.e.,
the energy density, of the term (recall that the dimensionality of the value ˜e is the
area, m2, see (32)). The dimensionality of the parameter
is the volume, m3
and therefore it is an eﬀective volume occupied by the charge ˜e at its interaction
with external photons.

W

Let us determine the charge jointly with its deformation coat, or the space
crystallite and consider the inerton-photon cloud as the whole object.
In that
event the object will be characterized by the constant velocity ~v0 in the space
and then the ﬂux ˜e~v0 should be treated as a current. The current as a vector is
capable to interact with an external vector ﬁeld ~α. So the density of the interaction
Lagrangian should be supplemented with one more term,

The Maxwell equations act in the area of classical physics, i.e., when wave
properties of a charged particle can be neglected. Evidently, this statement is
the direct consequence of the Lagrangian density written in the form (56), which
particle
takes into account the interaction of the external ﬁeld with the whole
{

complex. The complex moves as
a classical object and its intrinsic dynamics does not appear beyond the cloud
boundary. The cloud is restricted along the particle trajectory by the spatial
period (i.e., de Broglie wavelength) λ and in transversal directions to the trajec-
tory by the cloud amplitude Λ
λc/v0. Thus the two particle parameters λ and
Λ limit the application of classical electrodynamics. Yet the wavelength λ photon

period of the phase change of the potentials ϕ and ~A) [35] and the time period

7. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The theory of the real physical space developed in works [28-30] has allowed
the construction of the theory of the charge in the form of a peculiar quantum of
fractal deformations, or a chestnut created from a superparticle that is the building
block of the space. The total number of superparticles of the space tessellattice
that spreads and forms all the universe deﬁnes the number of the charge needles
10168. The approach proposed has allowed the
estimated by the value of N
∼
geometric interpretation of major notions of electrodynamics such as the electric
ﬁeld vector ~E and the vector potential ~A of the magnetic ﬁeld.

A particle and inerton-photon quasi-particles, which accompany it, carry the
inert mass, electric charge and spin. Free, or real quasi-particles, irradiated by
a particle should carry at least some of these properties as well. Namely, a free
inerton that is radiated by a particle leaving its inerton cloud must carries the
mass. A free photon should carry the electromagnetic polarization and, due to
its location on the inerton, the photon should carry also the mass (see also Ref.
[35]). These two quasi-particles move uniformly and rectilinearly already on a mi-
croscopic scale (Fig. 7), though at the submicroscopic consideration they travel
by the relay mechanism hopping from superparticle to superparticle. The particle
cannot move uniformly on a microscopic scale, its motion is adiabatic and non-
stationary: Owing to the interaction with surrounding superparticles the particle
moves with oscillating velocity [19-22]. However, on the macroscopic scale that
prevails the size of the de Broglie wavelength λ the behavior of the particle re-
sembles that of a classical object; and the behavior is exactly classical on a scale
larger than the particle’s inerton cloud amplitude Λ.

The electric and magnetic polarizations are evolved separately, as Eqs. (49)
and (46) demonstrate, and at the maximum distance from the particle, Λ, the
electric polarization of the inerton-photon cloud (caused by the ﬁeld ϕ) drops
to zero, but the magnetic polarization reaches its maximum, ~αmax. Since the
mass of the inerton cloud gradually decreases to zero at the distance Λ from the
particle by Newton’s law 1/r [24], we may anticipate that the value of the electric
polarization of the cloud should decrease by the same law 1/r, i.e. Coulomb’s law.
[35] and in the present work we have argued that the photon polar-
ization is kept on the surface of the corresponding inerton and, because of that,
the photon is characterized by the mass as well.
It must be emphasized once
again that de Broglie [36,37] was the ﬁrst who conjectured that the photon was
characterizing by mass. Besides, the geometry of the charge constructed clearly

demonstrates the availability of an additional mass introduced by the fractal de-
formations of the surface. Indeed the total volume of the particle should consists
of two terms: the background volume 4πR3
part/3 that corresponds to the particle
mass and the volume of all the needles NV (0)
needle (see expression (28)), though this
correction seems should be neglected.

The present model of the electric charge leads to the Maxwell equations and
hence the model perfectly agrees with classical electrodynamics. However, it is
only true in the case when the frequency ν = E/h of proper oscillations of the
particle along its path satisﬁes the inequality ν > νphoton where νphoton is the
frequency of a photon of an applied electromagnetic ﬁeld (note here E = M v2
0/2

0/c2). With the opposite inequality, ν < νphoton, eﬀects
where M
of strong interaction should take place, because the scattering of the photon by
the inerton-photon cloud of the particle becomes inelastic, i.e., an outside photon
penetrates into the cloud. The Compton scattering of light by the particle occurs
at the boundary of the particle’s space crystallite whose size is λ C = M c/h [19-25].
The screening of the particle charge is restricted by the crystallite and therefore
the crystallite electric ﬁeld must be extraordinary powerful. That is why the ﬁeld

should strongly polarize the crystallite creating virtual particle-antiparticle pairs.
Such eﬀects fall within the study of high energy physics. The theory of the real
physical space and submicroscopic mechanics are capable to contribute a lot to
high energy physics clarifying major notions of particle physics, hidden dynamics
of particle interactions and inner reasons of particle transformations.

The concept of submicroscopic fractality starting on the scale of about 10−30 m
is distributed to cosmic scale subdividing the universe into ranges of intermediate
levels (quarks, atoms, molecules, human size, star systems, etc.) [29,30]. Besides,
it introduces charge topology in both the micro- and macroscopic world. For
instance, typical manifestations of fractal geometry, a quantum of fractal defor-
mations, on a macroscopic scale are a chestnut, ﬂower, crown of a tree, hedgehog
and so on (positive charges). Furthermore, if we determine the characteristic
fractality of the root of plant and the male sex as a positive charge, we automati-
cally should recognize that the opposite fractality, namely, the stomach of a living
entity and the female sex is a typical negative charge.

It is interesting to emphasize that the submicroscopic fractality of space would
be an actual ground for the justiﬁcation of isomathematics that has been devel-
oping by Santilli [46] and his followers for the strongly interacting systems, from
hadrons to molecules and molecular compounds (see, e.g. Ref. [47]).

Finally, let us turn to the epigraph to this paper, which was taken from the
recent book Vedic Physics by Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy [48]. Roy analyzed the
Vedic literature in detail reading it as a physicist and he was not acquainted with
the author’s study of the real space. His decoding of The R. gveda, which means
’the top of knowledge’ in word-to-word translation to modern languages, shows
that this is a book about the constitution of the real space, particle physics and
cosmology. Indeed: i) the epigraph above (Roy’s decoding) exactly corresponds to
the contents of the present paper; ii) the three steps of God Vis.nu (the universe)
represent the space web by Roy’s decoding, which consists of indivisible cells,
their interface (i.e., the surface) and the observer space (i.e., the aggregation
of cells), which also in agreement with our theory. Besides, all other details
uncovered by Roy are in accord with contemporary physics. Therefore it cannot
be overestimated that the physics pattern presented in the study above, including
Refs. [28-30], exactly matches the Vedic picture of the physical world, which has
been unravelled in Roy’s Vedic Physics [48].

Inequalities (A18) point out that the surface defect (A3) has no extreme. There-

form the charge state in a cell of the tessellattice.

Wavefront and ray-density plots using seventh-order
matrices

Abstract

The optimization of an optical system beneﬁts greatly from a study of its aber-
rations and an identiﬁcation of each of its elements’ contribution to the overall
aberration ﬁgures. The matrix formalism developed by one of the authors was the
object of a previous paper and allows the expression of image-space coordinates
as high-order polynomials of object-space coordinates. In this paper we approach
the question of aberrations, both through the evaluation of the wavefront evolution
along the system and its departure from the ideal spherical shape and the use of ray
density plots. Using seventh-order matrix modeling, we can calculate the optical
path between any two points of a ray as it travels along the optical system and
we deﬁne the wavefront as the locus of the points with any given optical path; the
results are presented on the form of traces of the wavefront on the tangential plane,
although the formalism would also permit sagital plane plots. Ray density plots are
obtained by actual derivation of the seventh-order polynomials.

1 Introduction

In previous papers [1, 2] it was shown that it is possible to determine coeﬃcients for
matrix modeling of optical systems up to any desired order, computing power being the
only limiting factor. The same paper lists the calculated seventh-order coeﬃcients for
systems comprising only spherical surfaces.

The optical path length (henceforth designated opl ) of any ray is the sum of the
path length multiplied by the medium refractive index, for all the media that compose
the optical system. The matrix modeling of the optical system is based on translations
between reference planes and orientation changes at the surfaces separating two diﬀerent
media. In the following paragraphs we will show that it is possible to evaluate the optical
path for all the translations incurred by any ray and add them up to get an overall opl
between any two points on any ray path.

If a known wavefront is used as origin for the evaluation of all opl s, then all subsequent
wavefronts are loci of points equidistant from the ﬁrst wavefront in opl terms. It is then
a question of preference the choice of method to display the wavefront shape. The traces
on the tangential and sagital planes lead to simpliﬁed calculations and we will show
examples of the former. Every departure from a spherical wavefront is a manifestation
of aberrations. The common choice for reference sphere is one that is centered on the
paraxial image point and contains the center of the exit pupil [4].

Ray-density plots are also useful diagnosis tools because they are similar to the actual
images that the system will produce. We will use the analytical expressions of image-space
coordinates to produce those plots.

2 Optical system model

If complex coordinates are used, an axis symmetric optical system is modeled in the
seventh-order by a product of 40 × 40 square matrices with real elements, each describing
a particular ray transformation. The elementary transformations can be classiﬁed in four
diﬀerent classes:

• Translation: A straight ray path.

• Surface refraction: Change in ray orientation governed by Snell’s law.

• Forward oﬀset: Ray path between the surface vertex plane and the surface.

• Reverse oﬀset: Ray path from the surface back to the vertex plane, along the

refracted ray direction.

The ray itself is described by a 40-element vector comprising the monomials of the
complex position and orientation coordinates that have non-zero coeﬃcients. The product
of all the elementary transformation matrices yields the system matrix which must be
right-multiplied by the incident ray vector to result in the exit ray vector.

The construction of elementary transformation matrices is facilitated by the method
described previously [2, 3]. It can then be assumed that for any system comprising only
spherical surfaces all the necessary coeﬃcients are known and the system is perfectly de-
scribed up to the seventh-order. All the equations presented in the following paragraphs,
relating complex ray coordinates in the form of polynomials, were evaluated by matrix
multiplication using the software Mathematica. The size of the matrices and the com-
plexity of the expressions imposes some care on the choice of elements to display; we will
usually show just the matrix element or the expression relevant for the explanation under
way.

In an aberration free optical system the wavefronts should have a spherical shape
throughout, or could eventually be ﬂat in a limiting case [4, 5, 6]. The departure from a
spherical wavefront shape is the manifestation of aberrations. In well designed systems
a wavefront may have become become aspherical to be partially corrected further along
the system. The study of the distortions introduced on the wavefront by each of the

2

elementary ray transformations can greatly elucidate about the performance of a par-
ticular system and provide clues for an optimization procedure. Walther [7, 8, 9] has
performed such optimizations using eikonals and computer algebra; in this paper we use
matrix formulation for the determination of wavefront shape at any point along a complex
system.

The method consists on evaluating the opl of the rays as they are subjected to the
successive transformations and adding them up until any desired position along the system
is reached; the result is the charateristic function V (X, S, z, z′), X = x + iy being the
complex position coordinate, S = s + it the complex orientation coordinate and z and z′
the positions of reference planes on object and image space, respectively [6, 10]; s and t
are the direction cosines relative to axes x and y, respectively.

Point objects are deﬁned by a set of ﬁxed coordinates (x, y, z) and so the total opl for
rays originating on a point object depends only on the ray orientation and image plane
position, V (S, z′). The locus of points with any given value of the opl, expressed by the
equation V (S, z′) = constant, constitutes a wavefront [6] whose shape can be plotted
or compared to a reference sphere. Before we start considering each of the elementary
transformations in turn we have to establish that in cases where the incident beam is
parallel we will evaluate the opl from an incident plane wavefront and ﬁnd the locus of
points with constant opl diﬀerence.

We will start by deﬁning a generalized ray of complex coordinates (X, S); this ray is
described by the 40-element monomials vector X&, built according to the rules explained
by Kondo [3] and Almeida [2].
If the ray is subjected to a transformation described
by matrix M, then the output ray has coordinates (X ′, S′) and is represented by the
monomials vector X′&, such that:

In the case of a translation the orientation coordinate does not change and the opl for

X′& = MX&.

that transformation is obviously given by:

l =

nd
(1 − SS∗)1/2 =

nd
(1 − S′S′∗)1/2 ,

(1)

(2)

with n being the refractive index of the optical medium, d the distance traveled along the
optical axis and the asterisk is used to represent conjugate. The product of one complex
number by its conjugate is obviously one means of ﬁnding the square of its modulus.

A surface refraction introduces an orientation change but no path length is involved
and so it oﬀers no contribution to the total opl. One optical surface contributes to the opl
through both the forward and reverse oﬀsets, which are not conceptually diﬀerent from the
translation; both are translations between the vertex plane and the surface, respectively
in the forward and the reverse directions, as represented in Fig. (1). It is legitimate to
use Eq. (2) to evaluate the path length contributions of these transformations, as long
as d is not given a ﬁxed value but is evaluated for each incidence position; note, though,
that there is a refractive index change from the forward to the reverse oﬀset, besides the
change in the ray orientation. In the following section we will detail this procedure.

Plane waves with oblique orientation must be dealt with separately. As the ray coor-
dinates are referenced to planes normal to the optical axis and there are phase diﬀerences

3

Figure 1: The ray intersects the surface at a point X1 which is diﬀerent both from the
point of intersection of the incident ray with the plane of the vertex, X, and the point of
intersection of the refracted ray with the same plane, X2. The surface is responsible for
three successive transformations: 1 – an oﬀset from X to X1, 2 – the refraction and 3 –
the oﬀset from X1 to X2.

between the plane wave rays that intercept the reference plane at various points, those
phase diﬀerences must be accounted for by an opl given by:

l0 = n(XX ∗SS∗)1/2 = n |X| |S| .

There is an implied assumption that the opl is zero for the ray that crosses the reference
plane on the optical axis.

3 Single refractive surface

We ﬁrst consider the case of a single surface with parallel incidence. According to the
previous argument, the ﬁrst opl that has to be considered is l0 given by Eq. (3), which
accounts for the phase diﬀerences of the incident beam when it crosses the surface vertex
plane; this will obviously vanish if the rays are parallel to the optical axis, which can
always be veriﬁed by a single surface, if the axis is chosen appropriately.

For the position coordinate of the ray after the forward oﬀset we refer to Fig. (1) and

use the coeﬃcients given by Almeida [2]:

where ν represents the refractive index ratio from the ﬁrst medium to the second.

The ray could now be traced back to the vertex plane along the S1 direction and
the respective opl calculated. We prefer not to do this but rather to use an equivalent
procedure which consists on evaluating the next translation opl from the point X1 on the
surface instead of from the vertex plane. The rays will now follow a straight path to the
image plane at some distance z′ from the surface; we calculate the corresponding opl (l2)
by means of Eq. (2) with d replaced by d2 = z′ − d1 and S replaced by S1 taken from Eq.
(6).

We are now able to evaluate the total path length, lt, in any position in the second

medium, just by adding the three contributions lt = l0 + l1 + l2.

4 Wavefront plots

In the previous paragraph we established the method to evaluate the path length for any
ray as it intercepts any given reference plane along the optical axis. In fact we deﬁned a
function of lt(X, z′) which is no other than the characteristic function linking points on a
wavefront in object space to points on a reference plane in image space. In order to deﬁne
the wavefront surface we must specify a reference value for the characteristic function and
ﬁnd the locus of the points where that reference value holds; for convenience we take the
value for the ray that intercepts the reference plane on the optical axis and call this lr.

Figure 2: The ﬁgure represents a ray crossing a reference plane normal to the optical
axis; the plane of the ﬁgure is not necessarily a meridional plane but it is rather the plane
containing the ray, which is normal to the reference plane.

Fig. 2 represents a ray crossing a reference plane normal to the optical axis; the plane
of the ﬁgure is not necessarily a meridional plane but it is rather the plane deﬁned by the
ray and the normal to the reference plane on the point of intersection. The ray coordinates
on the point of intersection are (X ′, S′) and the medium refractive index is n′; the optical
path diﬀerence is given by the diﬀerence ∆ = lr − lt. If we were to follow along the ray
the distance ∆/n′ we would ﬁnd a point with the same opl as the reference; this point is
necessarily on the same wavefront as the reference point.

From the ﬁgure we see that the projection of the distance ∆/n′ on the reference plane

is given by:
∆
n′ cos α .

ρ =

The factor cos α can be decomposed on the direction cosines relative to axes x and y,
leading to two components ρx and ρy, which must be added to the position coordinates
of the intersection point in order to obtain the coordinates of the wavefront point; in
complex notation it is:

X ′′ = X ′ +

The two equations (8) and (10) deﬁne a surface whose points have all the same optical

path and so, by deﬁnition, they are the wavefront equations.

5 Numerical example

For this example we chose a convex spherical surface of 1 m radius, which marks the
boundary between air and a 1.5 refractive index optical medium, upon which impinges
a bundle of parallel rays; the optical axis is chosen to be the line containing the center
of curvature which is parallel to the impinging rays. This simple optical system has a
paraxial focal distance of 3 m and the paraxial focus is the center of all the aberration–free
wavefronts considered after refraction.

We want to depict the wavefront shape through its trace on the meridional plane; this
allows an important simpliﬁcation, as the rays’ position coordinate has null imaginary
component and is thus represented by the real component x; furthermore, the orientation
coordinate is zero because all the impinging rays are parallel to the optical axis. As a
result we have x1 = x and from Eq. (5):

l1 = d1 = r − (r2 − x2

1)1/2 .

(11)

The orientation coordinate after refraction, S1, is real for all rays on the meridional
plane and so it is represented in lower case: S1 = s1. This was evaluated by matrix
multiplication but we could just as well have used Eq. (6) with suitable substitutions.
We applied Eq. (2) to evaluate the optical path contribution of the translation from the
surface vertex plane to a reference plane located 2.8 m after the surface; the refractive
index was set to n = 1.5 and the distance was set to d2 = 2.8 − d1. Eqs. (8) and (10), with
real position coordinates, were used to evaluate the curve of the wavefront trace which
was then plotted as shown in Fig. 3 superimposed on the traces of meridional rays; these
are naturally normal to the wavefront in every point. We notice that the ends of the
wavefront are folded and show a convex curvature, indicating spherical aberration. The
points on the curve with zero curvature radius are points on a caustic arising from the
crossing of rays with diﬀerent directions.

6 Single lens

We turn our attention now to a thin lens with oblique incidence. The lens is convex on
the ﬁrst surface and ﬂat on the second surface, the convex surface has a curvature radius

of 31.123 mm and the center thickness is 5.8 mm; the glass is BK7, deﬁned as having a
refractive index of 1.5168. This lens has a nominal focal distance of 60 mm. The rays
incident upon the lens form a parallel bundle with a direction cosine s = 0.1.

The only added complication to the situation of the single surface results from the
consideration of the second surface, which marks the transition from glass to air with no
associated curvature. The optical axis is now clearly identiﬁed by the line normal to the
ﬂat surface and containing the ﬁrst surface’s center of curvature and cannot be aligned
with the direction of incidence. Oblique incidence promotes the emergence of the various
aberration terms but does not imply any new equations.

The wavefront is studied at a distance of 52 mm and its meridional trace is plotted on
Fig. 4. Again we notice that the rays are normal to the wavefront and that the ends of
this are folded backwards. The sharper bend of the upper end is an indication of coma.
The other aberration terms are not clearly noticeable on the ﬁgure because in the case
of astigmatism we would have to compare with the sagital plot and in the cases of ﬁeld
curvature and distortion the wavefront is still spherical but its center is shifted from the
paraxial position.

7 Ray-density plots

In order to study the ray-density plots we use the lens of the previous example wit the
image plane moved to a position just past the tangential focus, i.e. 56 mm, because this is
a natural position and also because all the rays are divergent from this position onwards.
This avoids the complication of having to deal with overlapping wavefront folds, each of
them contributing independently to the overall ray-density.

The overall system matrix for the lens above followed by a straight path to the image
plane was evaluated with the help of Mathematica and then right-multiplied by the input
ray vector X& composed with the variable complex position coordinate, X, and ﬁxed
orientation coordinate, s = 0.1. The result is a 40–element vector, the ﬁrst of which is a
7th–order polynomial on X, representing the dependence of the point of intersection on
the image plane on the input variable; we call this X ′.

If it is established that the input beam has a uniform ray-density, then the image-plane

ray-density is given by:

beam of light.

8 Conclusion

Previous results had shown that optical systems could be modeled with matrices up to
any desired order of approximation and the necessary coeﬃcients for axis-symmetrical
systems built with spherical surfaces had already bean reported. Those results have now
been used to evaluate aberrations in non-standard ways.

An implementation of the seventh-order matrix algorithm in Mathematica allows the
construction of algebraic models for very complex systems, which can be used in various
ways to judge their performance and quality.

The possibility of plotting wavefront shapes at any point along a complex optical
system was demonstrated with two simple examples but the same procedure could be used
in more complex situations. Ray-density plots were also demonstrated, these providing
a visualization of the actual image of point objects. It is expected that ray-density plots
can be integrated for extended objects, thus yielding the expected aberrated images given
by real optical systems.

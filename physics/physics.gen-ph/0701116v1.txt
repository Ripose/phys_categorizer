Abstract

A general way to model entanglement is presented that goes much
beyond the usual one which is using tensor products of vector spaces.
In this general approach to entanglement, and unlike in the particular
case of tensor products, the spaces involved can be rather arbitrary
sets, just as in the case of Cartesian products, thus in particular, they
need not be vector spaces or groups.

0. Preliminaries

Entanglement, as an essential physical phenomenon in Quantum Me-
chanics, appeared for the ﬁrst time in the celebrated 1935 EPR paper
of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, [2]. The term entanglement itself,
however, was not used in that paper.
Instead, it was introduced,
in German, in the subsequent papers of Schr¨odinger, [4,5], in which
he commented on the state of Quantum Mechanics at the time, and
among others, brought to attention the problematic situation which
ever since would be called Schr¨odinger’s cat.
As for the special place of the EPR paper in Quantum Mechanics,
suﬃce it to mention that till the 1980s, it has already been cited more
than one million times, [1], and even today, more than seven decades
after its publication, it is still the paper most often downloaded from

1

the web site of the American Physical Society, [6].

Independently, and prior to that, in Multilinear Algebra, the concept
of tensor product was introduced by mathematicians in view of its
universal property of establishing a natural connection between mul-
tilinear and linear mappings, see Appendix.

It took some time, both for physicists and mathematicians, to become
aware of the fact that a natural mathematical formulation of quantum
entanglement can be obtained with tensor products of Hilbert spaces.
And this issue has lately become even more fundamental with the
emergence and massive development of Quantum Information, and in
particular, Quantum Computation, where entanglement proves to be
one of the most important quantum resources that can make quan-
tum computers signiﬁcantly more powerful than the usual digital ones.

Indeed, let us recall that within Classical Mechanics, given two systems
S and S ′ whit the respective state spaces X and X ′, their composi-
tion will have the state space given by the Cartesian product X × X ′.
On the other hand, in Quantum Mechanics, the composition of two
systems Q and Q ′, with the respective state spaces H and H ′, is given
by the tensor product H N H ′ of the Hilbert spaces H and H ′.

And to have a ﬁrst and simple appreciation of the diﬀerence, let us
recall that given two vector spaces E and F , with the respective ﬁnite
dimensions m and n, the dimension of their Cartesian product E × F
is m + n, while that of their tensor product E N F is mn.
In Quantum Computation this diﬀerence has the following dramatic
convenient eﬀect. The basic quantum information, a qubit, is an el-
ement of the two dimensional Hilbert space H = C2. Consequently,
the state space of an n-qubit quantum system, a typical register in
is described by the n-factor tensor product
a quantum computer,
C2 N . . . N C2 which has the dimension 2n. Therefore, one can ob-
tain an exponentially fast increase in the capacity of a quantum reg-
ister, simply by a linear increase in the length of that quantum reg-
ister. Needless to say, there is nothing similar possible with usual
digital computers, where the composition giving registers happens in
the realms of Classical Mechanics, hence through Cartesian products.

2

The aim of this paper, in view of the above, is as follows. So far,
entanglement was modelled mathematically only by tensor products
of vector spaces. In view of the signiﬁcant importance of entanglement,
one can ask the question :

• Can entanglement be modelled in other more general ways, than

by tensor products of vector spaces ?

Here we give an aﬃrmative answer to this question, by presenting
general, and yet simple ways of entanglement, which contain as a
particular case tensor products. In fact, in that general approach to
entanglement, and unlike in the particular case of tensor products of
vector spaces, the spaces involved can be rather arbitrary sets, just as
in the case of Cartesian products, thus in particular, they need not be
vector spaces, and not even groups or semigroups.

1. Generators and Bases

Deﬁnition 1.1.

Given any set X, a mapping ψ : P(X) −→ P(X) will be called a
generator, if and only if

(1.1)

∀ A ⊆ X : A ⊆ ψ(A)

and

(1.2)

∀ A ⊆ A ′ ⊆ X : ψ(A) ⊆ ψ(A ′)

Examples 1.1.

1) A trivial example of generator is given by ψ = idP(X), that is,
ψ(A) = A, for A ⊆ X.

2) An example which is important in the sequel is obtained as follows.
Given any binary operation α : X × X −→ X, we call a subset A ⊆ X

3

to be α-stable, if and only if

(1.3)

x, y ∈ A =⇒ α(x, y) ∈ A

Obviously, X is α-stable, and the intersection of any family of α-stable
subsets is α-stable. Consequently, for every subset A ⊆ X, we can de-
ﬁne the smallest α-stable subset which contains it, namely

(1.4)

[A]α = TA⊆B, B α−stable B

Therefore, we can associate with α the mapping ψα : P(X) −→ P(X)
deﬁned by

(1.5)

ψα(A) = [A]α, A ⊆ X

which is obviously a generator. Furthermore, we have in view of (1.4)

(1.6)

∀ A ⊆ X : ψα(ψα(A)) = ψα(A)

since as mentioned, [A]α is α-stable, and obviously [A]α ⊆ [A]α.

We note that, in general, the relation ψ(ψ(A)) = ψ(A), with A ⊆ X,
need not hold for an arbitrary generator ψ.

3) A particular case of 2) above is the following. Let (S, ∗) be a
semigroup with the neutral element e. Then [{e}]∗ = {e}, while for
a ∈ S, a 6= e, we have [{a}]∗ = {a, a ∗ a, a ∗ a ∗ a, . . .}.

For instance, if (S, ∗) = (N, +), then [{1}]+ = N \ {0} = N+.

Given a generator ψ : P(X) −→ P(X), a subset B ⊆ X is called a
ψ-basis for X, if and only if

Deﬁnition 1.2.

(1.7)

ψ(B) = X

Let us denote by

4

(1.8) Bψ(X)

Note 1.1.

the set of all B ⊆ X which are a ψ-basis for X.
obviously X ∈ Bψ(X).

In view of (1.1),

1) In view of 3) in Examples 1.1., it follows that neither {0}, nor {1}
are ψ+-bases in (N, +), while on the other hand, {0, 1} is.

2) Given a binary operation α : X × X −→ X, then in view of (1.5),
a subset B ⊆ X is a ψα-basis for X, if and only if

(1.9)

[B]α = X

2. Covering Generators

Deﬁnition 2.1.

Given the sets X and Y , with the corresponding generators ψ : P(X) −→
P(X), ϕ : P(Y ) −→ P(Y ), and χ : P(X × Y ) −→ P(X × Y ). We
call χ to be a covering for ψ, ϕ, if and only if

(2.1)

∀ A ⊆ X, B ⊆ Y : ψ(A) × ϕ(B) ⊆ χ(A × B)

Example 2.1.

Obviously, if ψ = idP(X), ϕ = idP(Y ) and χ = idP(X×Y ), then χ is a
covering for ψ, ϕ.

(cid:3)

Let now α : X × X −→ X and β : Y × Y −→ Y be two binary oper-
ations and, as usual, let us associate with them the binary operation
α × β : (X × Y ) × (X × Y ) −→ (X × Y ) given by

(2.2)

(α × β)((x, y), (u, v)) = (α(x, u), β(y, v)), x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y

5

Then (1.5) results in

Lemma 2.1.

ψα×β is a covering for ψα, ψβ.

Proof.

In view of (2.1), let A ⊆ X, B ⊆ Y . Then (1.5) gives

ψα(A) = [A]α, ψβ(B) = [B]β, ψα×β(A × B) = [A × B]α×β

hence for (2.1), we have to show that

(2.3)

[A]α × [B]β ⊆ [A × B]α×β

Let C ⊆ X × Y be α × β-stable and such that A × B ⊆ C. Then in
view of (2.2), this means that

(2.4)

∀ x, u ∈ A, y, v ∈ B : (α(x, u), β(y, v)) ∈ C

since (x, y), (u, v) ∈ A×B implies (x, y), (u, v) ∈ C, hence (α(x, u), β(y, v)) =
(α × β)((x, y), (u, v)) ∈ C.

But (2.4) obviously yields

[A]α × [B]β ⊆ C

thus (1.4) implies (2.3).

3. A First More General Case of Entanglement

Deﬁnition 3.1.

Given two binary operations α : X×X −→ X and β : Y ×Y −→ Y , to-
gether with two subsets A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y . A subset C ⊆ [A × B]α×β

6

is called entangled, if and only if it is not of the form

(3.1) C = [A ′]α × [B ′]β

for some A ′ ⊆ A and B ′ ⊆ B.

Examples 3.1.

1) As a standard example, let (X, α) = (Y, β) = (S, ∗), where (S, ∗) is
a semigroup. Then (X × Y, α × β) = (S2, ∗), where

(x, y) ∗ (u, v) = (x ∗ u, y ∗ v),

x, u, y, v ∈ S

Let now A, B ⊆ S and C ⊆ [A × B]∗. Then in the sense of Deﬁnition
3.1. above, C is not entangled, if an only if

C = [A ′]∗ × [B ′]∗

for some A ′ ⊆ A and B ′ ⊆ B.

In particular, C is not entangled, if

C = [A]∗ × [B]∗

In general, however, we have

(3.2)

[A]∗ × [B]∗ $ [A × B]∗

Indeed, let (X, α) = (Y, β) = (N, +), while A = B = {1}. Then
[A]+ = [B]+ = N+, thus [A]+ × [B]+ = N2
+. On the other hand,
A × B = {(1, 1)}, hence [A × B]+ = {(n, n) | n ∈ N+}.

Therefore

(3.3) C = [A × B]∗ is in general entangled

2) Let us consider the particular situation in Example 2.1. above and
take any A ⊆ X, B ⊆ Y . Then obviously [A]ψ × [B]ϕ = A × B =

7

[A × B]χ, therefore [A × B]χ is not entangled.

3) Let us recall the standard deﬁnition of tensor product in the case
of two semigroups (X, α) and (Y, β). One way to proceed, convenient
in the sequel, is as follows. Let us denote by Z the set of all ﬁnite
sequences of pairs

(3.4)

(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)

where n ∈ N+, while xi ∈ X, yi ∈ Y , with 1 ≤ i ≤ n. We deﬁne on Z
the binary operation γ simply by the concatenation of the sequences
(3.4). It follows that γ is associative, therefore, each sequence (3.4)
can be written as

(3.5)

(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) = (x1, y1)γ(x2, y2)γ . . . γ(xn, yn)

where for n = 1, the right hand term is understood to be simply
(x1, y1).

Further, according to usual convention, one introduces the tensorial
notation by writing

(3.6)

(x, y) = x N y,

x ∈ X, y ∈ Y

Thus (3.4) - (3.6) give

(3.7) Z = { (x1 N y1)γ . . . γ(xn N yn) | xi ∈ X, yi ∈ Y }

Now we deﬁne on Z an equivalence relation ≈ as follows. Two se-
quences in (3.4) are equivalent, if and only if each can be obtained
from the other by a ﬁnite number of applications of the following op-
erations

(3.8) permuting the pairs (xi, yi) within the sequence

(3.9) replacing (α(x1, x ′
(x1, y1), (x ′

1), y1), . . . , (xn, yn) with
1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn), or vice-versa

8

(3.10) replacing (x1, β(y1, y ′
(x1, y1), (x1, y ′

1)), . . . , (xn, yn) with
1), . . . , (xn, yn), or vice-versa

Finally, the tensor product of the semigroups (X, α) and (Y, β) is de-
ﬁned to be the quotient space

(3.11) X N Y = Z/ ≈

and the binary operation γ on Z leads by this quotient to a commuta-
tive semigroup operation on X N Y , which for convenience is denoted
by the same γ.

The customary situation is when X and Y are commutative semi-
groups, groups, or even vector spaces over some ﬁeld K. In this case
α, β and γ are denoted by +

4) In the case of two semigroups (X, α) and (Y, β), and with the ten-
sorial notation in 3) above, condition (3.1) in Deﬁnition 3.1. of en-
tanglement can be written in the following equivalent form. Given
A ⊆ X, B ⊆ Y , then a subset C ⊆ [A N B]γ is entangled, if and only
if it is not of the form

(3.12) C = [A ′]α N[B ′]β

for some A ′ ⊆ A and B ′ ⊆ B.

Here for U ⊆ X, V ⊆ Y , we used the notation

(3.13) U N V = { u N v | u ∈ U, v ∈ V }

Obviously, condition (3.12) above recovers the usual concept of entan-
glement in tensor products.

5) It is easy to note that in the construction of tensor product in 3)
above, it is not necessary for (X, α) and (Y, β) to be semigroups. In-
deed, it is suﬃcient that α and β are associative binary operations on
X and Y , respectively.

9

Also, as seen in 3) above, α and β need not be commutative either.
However, the tensor product X N Y will nevertheless be commutative.
(cid:3)

The above Examples 3.1.
below. First, however, we need the following

lead to the general result in Theorem 3.1.

Deﬁnition 3.2.

a if n = 1

aα, n =

and similarly for aα, m.

Theorem 3.1.

Given an associative binary operation α : X × X −→ X. An element
a ∈ X is called cyclic, if and only if for certain m > n ≥ 1, we have
aα, m = aα, n, where we denote

a α . . . α a with a appearing n times

if n ≥ 2

(cid:3)

Clearly, if (X, α) is a semigroup, then the neutral element is cyclic.

Given two associative binary operations α : X × X −→ X and
β : Y × Y −→ Y . Then

∀ a ∈ X, b ∈ Y, a and b not cyclic :

[ { a N b } ]α×β is entangled

(3.14)

Proof.

In view of (3.1), we have to show that

(3.15)

[ { a N b } ]α×β 6= [ {a} ]α N [ {b} ]β

Let us therefore assume on the contrary the relation

10

= {a N b, (a N b) α×β (a N b), (a N b) α×β (a N b) α×β (a N b), . . .} =

= {a N b, (a α a) N(b β b), (a α a α a) N(b β b β b), . . .}

(3.16)

[ { a N b } ]α×β = [ {a} ]α N [ {b} ]β

Since α and β are associative, then obviously

[{a}]α = {a, a α a, a α a α a, . . .}

[{b}]β = {b, b β b, b β b β b, . . .}

[ { a N b } ]α×β =

Thus clearly

[{a}]α = { aα, n | n ≥ 1}

[{b}]β = { bβ, n | n ≥ 1}

[ { a N b } ]α×β = {(a N b)α×β, n | n ≥ 1}

the last relation being equivalent with

[ { (a, b) } ]α×β = {(a, b)α×β, n | n ≥ 1}

In this way (3.16) yields

∀ n, m ≥ 1 :

∃ k ≥ 1 :

(aα, n, bβ, m) = (a, b)α×β, k

which means that

11

(3.17)

∀ n, m ≥ 1 :

∃ k ≥ 1 :

aα, n = aα, k

bβ, m = bβ, k

Let us now ﬁx n = 1. Then (3.17) gives

∀ m ≥ 1 :

∃ k ≥ 1 :

aα, k = a

bβ, m = bβ, k

Therefore, if k depends on m, then a is cyclic, while if k does not de-
pend on m, then b is cyclic. The contradiction obtained proves (3.15).

4. A General Concept of Entanglement

We shall extend the context of entanglement in section 3 above, and
do so twofold. Namely, we shall consider arbitrary generators, that
is, not necessarily associated with binary operations. And second,
the generators on the Cartesian products will no longer be deﬁned by
those on the two factors, and instead, will merely be related to them
in a suitable fashion. In other words, we shall operate in the general
context of Deﬁnition 2.1.

Suppose therefore given the sets X and Y , with the corresponding
generators ψ : P(X) −→ P(X), ϕ : P(Y ) −→ P(Y ), and χ :
P(X × Y ) −→ P(X × Y ).
We shall assume that χ is a covering for ψ and ϕ.

Deﬁnition 4.1.

Given two subsets A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y . A subset C ⊆ [A × B]χ is

12

called entangled, if and only if it is not of the form

(4.1) C = [A ′]α × [B ′]β

for some A ′ ⊆ A and B ′ ⊆ B.

Note 4.1.

1) In view of Lemma 2.1., it is obvious that the concept of entan-
glement in Deﬁnition 3.1.
is a particular case of the one given in
Deﬁnition 4.1. above.

2) The interest in the general concept of entanglement in Deﬁnition
4.1. is, among others, in the fact that it is no longer conﬁned within
an algebraic context. In this way, this paper shows that entanglement
can, so to say, be de-entangled not only from tensor products, but also
more generally, from algebra.

3) A further interest in the general concept of entanglement in Deﬁni-
tion 4.1. is as follows. The structure on the ”parts” X and Y is deﬁned
by ψ and ϕ, respectively. On the other hand - and much unlike in the
case of tensor products - the structure on the ”whole” constituted by
the ”parts”, namely, on X × Y is not deﬁned by ψ and ϕ, but instead
by χ which is only requested a rather weak compatibility condition
with ψ and ϕ. In this way - and once again much unlike with tensor
products - there is a signiﬁcant freedom for the structure on X × Y ,
when related to the structures on X and Y , and yet, the concept of
entanglement can be deﬁned.

4) The usual concept of entanglement in tensor products is in fact
given by a negation, that is, the inexistence of a certain kind of repre-
sentation. Consequently, any extension and deepening of that concept
is likely to open up a large variety of meaningful possibilities.

5) Quantum physics arguments of quite some concern related to the
usual tensor product based concept of entanglement were recently pre-
sented in [7]. And they indicate what may be seen as a lack of onto-
logical robustness of that concept. As an eﬀect, one may expect that

13

what appears to be entanglement in terms of tensor products may in
fact correspond to considerably deeper aspects. In this regard, the old
saying that ”the whole is more than the sum of its parts” may in fact
mean that what is involved in that ”more” can correspond to very
diﬀerent things, depending on the situation.

6) Applications of the general concept of entanglement in Deﬁnition
4.1. are to be presented in a subsequent paper.

Appendix

For convenience, we recall here certain main features of the usual ten-
sor product of vector spaces, and relate them to certain properties of
Cartesian products.

Let K be a ﬁeld and E, F, G vector spaces over K.

A1. Cartesian Product of Vector Spaces

Then E × F is the vector space over K where the operations are given
by

λ(x, y) + µ(u, v) = (λx + µu, λy + µv)

for any x, y ∈ E, u, v ∈ F, λ, µ ∈ K.

A2. Linear Mappings

Let L(E, F ) be the set of all mappings

f : E −→ F

such that

f (λx + µu) = λf (x) + µf (u)

14

for u, v ∈ E, λ, µ ∈ K.

A3. Bilinear Mappings

Let L(E, F ; G) be the set of all mappings

g : E × F −→ G

It is easy to see that

L(E, F ; G) = L(E, L(F, G))

A4. Tensor Products

such that for x ∈ E ﬁxed, the mapping F ∋ y 7−→ g(x, y) ∈ G is linear
in y, and similarly, for y ∈ F ﬁxed, the mapping E ∋ x 7−→ g(x, y) ∈ G
is linear in x ∈ E.

The aim of the tensor product E N F is to establish a close connection
between the bilinear mappings in L(E, F ; G) and the linear mappings
in L(E N F, G).

Namely, the tensor product E N F is :

(A4.1)

a vector space over K, together with

(A4.2)

a bilinear mapping t : E × F −→ E N F , such that we
have the following :

UNIVERSALITY PROPERTY

15

∀ V vector space over K, g ∈ L(E, F ; V ) bilinear mapping :

∃ ! h ∈ L(E N F, V ) linear mapping :

h ◦ t = g

or in other words :

and

(A4.4)

the tensor product E N F is unique up to vector
space isomorphism.

Therefore we have the injective mapping

L(E, F ; V ) ∋ g 7−→ h ∈ L(E N F, V ) with

h ◦ t = g

The converse mapping

L(E N F, V ) ∋ h 7−→ g = h ◦ t ∈ L(E, F ; V )

obviously exists. Thus we have the bijective mapping

16

L(E N F, V ) ∋ h 7−→ g = h ◦ t ∈ L(E, F ; V )

A5. Lack of Interest in L(E × F, G)

Let f ∈ L(E × F, G) and (x, y) ∈ E × F , then (x, y) = (x, 0) + (0, y),
hence

f (x, y) = f ((x, 0) + (0, y)) = f (x, 0) + f (0, y)

thus f (x, y) depends on x and y in a particular manner, that is, sep-
arately on x, and separately on y.

A6. Universality Property of Cartesian Products

Let X, Y be two nonvoid sets. Their cartesian product is :

(A6.1)

a set X × Y , together with

(A6.2)

two projection mappings pX : X × X −→ X,
pY : X × Y −→ Y , such that we have the following :

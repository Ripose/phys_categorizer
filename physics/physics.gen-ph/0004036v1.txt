INTERSTELLAR HYDROGEN AND

COSMIC BACKGROUND RADIATION

Abstract

It is shown that a collection of photons with nearly the same fre-
quency exhibits a ”condensation” type of phenomenon corresponding
to a peak intensity. The observed cosmic background radiation can
be explained from this standpoint in terms of the radiation due to
ﬂuctuations in interstellar Hydrogen.

In a previous communication[1] it was suggested that the origin of the Cosmic
Background Radiation is the random motion of interstellar Hydrogen. We
will now deduce the same result from a completely diﬀerent point of view.
We start with the formula for the average occupation number for photons of
momentum ~k for all polarizations[2]:

hn~ki =

2

eβ¯hω − 1

(1)

Let us specialize to a scenario in which all the photons have nearly the same
energy so that we can write,

(2)
where hn~k′i is given by (1), and k ≡ |~k|. The total number of photons N, in
the volume V being considered, can be obtained in the usual way,

hn~ki = hn~k′iδ(k − k′),

N =

where V is large. Inserting (2) in (3) we get,

N =

2V
(2π)3 4πk′2[ǫθ − 1]−1[k], θ ≡ β¯hω,

(4)

In the above, [k] ≡ [L−1] is a dimensionality constant, introduced to com-
pensate the loss of a factor k in the integral (3), owing to the δ-function in
(2): That is, a volume integral in ~k space is reduced to a surface integral on
the sphere |~k| = k′, due to our constraint that all photons have nearly the
same energy.
We observe that, θ = ¯hω/KT ≈ 1, since by (2), the photons have nearly the
same energy ¯hω. We also introduce,

λ being the wave length of the radiation. We now have from (4), using (5),

or conversely.
Though equation (7) is quite general, as it stands, we have to assign suitable
units to it depending on the particular physical situation: We must get an
additional input, in the order of magnitude sense, from the system under
consideration to ﬁx the units.
Let us now consider the case of radiations due to ﬂuctuations of the cold
interstellar Hydrogen as considered from an alternative view point in ref.[1].
In this case it is infact known that 1
υ ∼ 1 molecule per c.c.[2, 3]. On the

2

other hand, the energy range for these cold molecules is small, so that the
above considerations apply. So from (7), owing to the fact that υ1/3 ∼ λcm.,
it follows that,

λ = 0.4cm.

(9)

Remembering that from (5), λ is the wave length and υ is the average volume
per photon, the condition (8) implies that all the photons are very densely
packed as in the case of Bose condensation. This means that from (9), we con-
clude that at the wave length 0.4cm, in the micro-wave region, the radiation
has a peak intensity. It is remarkable that the cosmic background radiation
has the maximum intensity exactly at the wave length given by (9)[4]. So,
even without the Big Bang event it is possible to receive the observed cosmic
background radiation due to ﬂuctuations in interstellar Hydrogen (cf.ref.[3]
and[5] for Hoyle and Wickramasinghe’s attempt to explain the background
radiation in terms of Helium synthesis, without invoking the Big Bang.)
The same conslusion can be obtained from yet another argument also[6]. In-
terestingly, El Naschie has studied the Cosmic Background Radiation from
the point of view of fractal quantum space time[7, 8].

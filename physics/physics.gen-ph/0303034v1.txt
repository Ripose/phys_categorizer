Abstract

The author discusses particular solutions of a second order equation designated by source equa-

tion. This equation is special because the metric of the space where it is written is inﬂuenced by

the solution, rendering the equation recursive. The recursion mechanism is established via a ﬁrst

order equation which bears some resemblance to Dirac equation. In this paper the author limits the

discussion to solutions with constant norm but makes use of 4-dimensional hypercomplex numbers

in matrix representation, a concept that is formally introduced in a section devoted to that aspect.

The particular solutions that are found exhibit symmetries that can be assigned to spin, electric

and color charges of elementary particles, leaving mass as a free parameter. Massless particles

can also be assigned to special solutions of the source equation, with the cases of photons, gluons

and gravitons clearly identiﬁed, together with another massless particle which does not seem to be

related to anything detected experimentally. Another section deals with particle dynamics under

ﬁelds, showing that both gravitational and electrodynamics can be modelled by geodesics of the

spaces whose metric tensors result from the recursion mechanism. Finally the author suggests two

lines of future work, one deriving ﬁelds from densities and currents of masses and charges and the

other one aimed at determining particles’ masses.

I. BACKGROUND

One can conceive of a very large computer with the sole task of solving a small number

of simultaneous diﬀerential equations, with the only itch that the equations are evolution-

ary, meaning that in the course of time their form evolves as a result of previously found

solutions. Assuming that the problem could be appropriately formulated, this would create

an evolutionary system of equations whose complexity would surely outgrow the computing

power of any machine. In a science-ﬁction pass one could also assume the computer to be

itself a product of the equations, such that its computing power would grow in parallel to the

equations’ complexity. The author proposes that the Universe as a whole is such a system,

whose evolution can be understood up to our ability to understand the basic equations. We

will deal with evolutionary equations by writing non-linear equations in 4-dimensional space;

the solutions to these will be seen as evolutionary when 3-dimensional space is considered.

To this eﬀect we will focus on one particular form of the basic equations as such equations

are not known to us in general, although we can discuss some of their characteristics. This

particular form is designated by source equation in Ref. [1] because it is the source of dy-

namics and dynamic space, an essential concept introduced in the reference cited earlier.

We believe the source equation to be a condensation of the basic equations in a similar way

to which Klein-Gordon and Helmholtz equations are condensations of Dirac and Maxwell

equations [2, 3]. The reader may also ﬁnd useful a look at Ref. [4] as this is a precursor

of the present paper, establishing most of the assumptions used here, including setting the

problem in a very speciﬁc 4-dimensional space, with the justiﬁcation for such an approach.

This discussion is about a mathematical problem, i. e. without any preexisting physical

assumptions: All the variables in the equations are pure numbers, unless clearly stated

otherwise, so the question of dimensional homogeneity is never an issue. This facet of the

issues at hand is detailed in Ref. [1] where it was shown that dimensions and physical

interpretation can be introduced at a later stage, simultaneously with the deﬁnition of the

physical constants c, G, ¯h and e.

The general form of the source equation is

∇µνψ =
where gµν is a space metric, ψ is a function whose mathematical characteristics will be
∇µ designates the covariant derivative with

respect to the coordinate xµ. We use Einstein’s summation convention, with Greek indices

and superscripts taking values between 0 and 3 and Roman ones running from 1 to 3. It

is presumed that the basic equations of the dynamics will provide a means of determining

gµν from ψ, in such a way that the successive equation-solution sets resulting from Eq.

(1) become coupled in a recursive manner, i. e. the solutions become self sustained. This

process then links the space metric to the dynamics, deﬁning what we have designated as

dynamic space, a space which contains and is generated by the dynamics. The space metric

will be considered separable in two components: an “inertia” reﬂecting the inﬂuence of the

particular point on the dynamic space whose coordinates are under consideration, and a

“ﬁeld” reﬂecting the inﬂuence of all other points.

It is important to emphasize that dynamic space excludes anything that does not partic-

ipate in the dynamics under study. If we take the viewpoint of Physics for one moment, at

the Universe’s scale everything participates in the grand dynamics and is contained in the

Universe’s dynamic space. When we decide to study some particular dynamics isolated from

the rest of the Universe, this dynamics deﬁnes a space for itself, which excludes everything

else. Inﬂuences from other dynamic spaces can be accounted for via the ﬁeld component of

the metric. Consider the Earth’s orbit around the Sun: We have the choice of using the dy-

namic space deﬁned by the two bodies, or the dynamic space of the Earth alone, inﬂuenced

then by a ﬁeld component due to the Sun. These two approaches are equivalent if within

the dynamic space concept we take universal space as a superposition of dynamic spaces,

within which we can choose the components for the need of a particular study.

In connection with dynamic space within the above view of superposed spaces, we deﬁne

also an observer space, which is by deﬁnition obtained through a coordinate change that

removes the inertia component from the metric of the dynamic space under consideration

by the observer. Observer space can be then seen as the result of a continuum of superposed

dynamic spaces where each point can be mapped to a point of one particular dynamic space

via inserting an inertia component in the dynamics equation of that space (as discussed in

Ref. [1]). In Physics, imagine one galaxy as dynamic space: When the galaxy’s dynamics

is studied in isolation its dynamic space extends to inﬁnity. With the inertia component

related to mass density, and with this density tending to zero with distance, the conversion

to observer space conﬁnes the galaxy to a limited region of observer space. A similar link

between dynamic and observer spaces can be applied to planetary systems, to the atom, and

eventually to particles.

This paper is the ﬁrst in a series which will examine some mechanisms of dynamic space

deﬁnition in a gradual process which has the potential to lead to universal space, starting

here with “elementary” particles. Next section deals with the mathematical characteris-

tics of the function ψ as the solution of Helmholtz equation, also known as the “standing

wave” equation, itself identiﬁed as contained in the source equation. We examine ﬁrst 2-

and 3- dimensional settings, with the ultimate intent to obtain a 4-dimensional formalism

adequate for expressing the source equation solutions and metric. Once such solutions are

found, their physical interpretation with and without ﬁelds follows to conﬁrm their ade-

quacy by leading to key features of gravitation and electromagnetism. Particles involved

with chromodynamics will only be introduced, without the necessary dynamic details.

II. 4-DIMENSIONAL COMPLEX NUMBERS

A complex number can be represented in the exponential form by

or equivalently in real-imaginary form as

ψ = meiθ

ψ = m(cos θ + i sin θ),

with m a positive number called the norm or modulus of the complex number. Either form is

well suited to represent harmonic functions of one variable relative to another by taking just

the real part. In the second form the variable ψ as a harmonic function would be dependent

on the variable θ by the relation ψ = m cos θ, with the ﬁrst form representing solutions

of Helmholtz equation in one dimension

ψ = me±ivx

d2
dx2 ψ =

−

v2ψ,

with θ = vx.

A complex number is also appropriate for representing 2-dimensional rotations since

such rotations are harmonic relations between two orthogonal directions of space. In this

(5)

interpretation a variation of coordinates in one of the directions is represented by the real

part, while the coeﬃcient of the imaginary part deals with the orthogonal direction. If the

two coordinates are associated as a complex number

the rotated coordinates are given by

x = x1 + ix2,

x′ = ψx,

which can be expressed in complex form as,

x′ = x1 cos θ

x2 sin θ + i

x1 sin θ + x2 cos θ

.

Complex numbers with norm unity belong to a group usually designated by U(1), isomorphic

to the group of 2-dimensional rotations SO(2), whereby rotations in opposite directions are

represented by plus and minus signs added to the exponent of their exponential form as

shown in Eq. (2), and a 2π rotation in either direction is equivalent to no rotation at all, i.

e. the null rotation, with the exponential replaced by unity, and is commonly referred as a

“full” rotation.

matrix u that veriﬁes the condition

In order to generalize complex numbers we designate by imaginary unit any traceless

then an imaginary matrix is deﬁned as the product of a real number by an imaginary unit;

In a similar formal manner, we can deﬁne also traceless matrices h designated Hermitian

units such that h2 = I. For such matrices we have

with δij being the Kronecker delta, making them Hermitian units as well as imaginary units

when multiplied by i.

When multiplied by i they do form a quaternion representational basis as deﬁned by

Hamilton [7] if the quaternion product is simultaneously deﬁned by:

where ψ† is the Hermitian conjugate of ψ; notice that the second equality results from

ψ being a unitary matrix. The transformation above performs a generic rotation in 3D

containing the earlier 2D rotations with double their angle as we can see by taking a vector

¯a along σ1 (only a1 is non-zero) and using Eqs. (16) and (17) in the similarity Eq. (18).
Coordinate x1 is then unchanged, and the other coordinates transform as follows:

x′2 = x2 cos(2θ)

x3 sin(2θ),

−

x′3 = x2 sin(2θ) + x3 cos(2θ).

(19)

The same relation holds true when a circular permutation of the indices is performed. This

result means that a 4π rotation angle is induced or two full rotations, for one cycle of the

exponent [2, 8, 9]. The group of 2

2 unitary matrices deﬁned by Eq. (15) is designated

×

by U(2), with SU(2) being the sub-group of those matrices whose determinant is unity

[2, 8] and the group of real orthogonal matrices of dimension 3, representing 3D rotations, is

designated by SO(3). It is said that SU(2) is a double cover or two-fold covering of SO(3)

in view of the angle doubling referred above [10].

Generalization of complex numbers to 3 dimensions implies that we consider also non-

unitary matrices; here the situation is more complicated than in 2 dimensions because the

entities we are deﬁning are 2

2 matrices and so must also be whatever generalizes the

×

modulus of a standard complex. Eq. (15) can be generalized with the insertion of a traceless

Hermitian matrix before the exponential; this factor is designated as modulus of the 3D

complex, which we will represent by

We will impose a further restriction on the modulus by taking the norm as a positive real

number:

Now we are ready to verify that the 3D complexes deﬁned through Eq. (20) can be used as

solutions of a 3-dimensional Helmholtz equation. Consider the following equation with ψ

(20)

taken as a standard complex number function of coordinates xj and ¯v a vector of components

vj and norm v:

usually the solution to this equation is written

where we have ignored an arbitrary phase factor and

This solution represents a plane standing wave with ¯v seen as deﬁning the orientation of the

wave. We call standing wave to a standing harmonic 3-dimensional pattern. Imagine that

ψ represents light intensity: The space will then be seen as alternating between bright and

dark along the wave direction; by deﬁning planes normal to that direction spaced at half the

wavelength we could split 3-dimensional space into alternating bright and dark zones. Using

instead ψ as a 3D complex we can write diﬀerent solutions for the same equation (23):

We must verify that Eq. (26) together with Relations (22) and (21) is a solution of Eq.

(23). The partial derivatives of ψ are of the form

where we have lowered the index of σj in order to avoid summation over j. The second
derivative in xj of ψ produces a term σjσj, and considering Relations (13), we get

When the three second derivatives are added we obtain Condition (25), and thus Eq. (23)

is veriﬁed.

With either complex or 3D complex solutions for ψ the general solution of Eq. (23) is

obtained through a superposition of positive and negative exponent solutions with diﬀer-

ent phase factors. The types of solutions, though, are diﬀerent: Both equations represent

standing plane waves but Eq. (26) is a associated to spinning of the points along the wave

direction at twice the wave frequency; we will now call this a spin 1/2 wave. General solu-

tions with 3D complex numbers are obtained by superposition of spin 1/2 waves; the norm

of the 3D complex solution is interpreted as the wave amplitude, while the modulus con-

tains information about its polarization. Spin 1/2 waves are especially indicated to describe

axially guided waves, while no-spin waves, described by complex numbers, are better suited

to describe unguided waves.

The question remains about the possibility of deﬁning hypercomplex numbers represent-

ing solutions of Helmholtz equation in 4 dimensions. It is impossible to add a 4th imaginary

unit on a par with the 3 quaternion units we used and end up with a division algebra [5]; this

does not mean, however, that we cannot deﬁne 4-dimensional complex numbers. We will

start with a discussion about 4-dimensional rotations, since in 2 and 3 dimensions complex

numbers have been associated to rotations and we are led to expect a similar relationship

in 4D.

Rotations in n-dimensional space are isomorphic to group SO(n) and determined by

n(n

1)/2 parameters [8, 9, 10], usually chosen as rotation angles; this means that in 4

dimensions we have to select 6 diﬀerent angles to characterize all possible rotations. There

are 6 very special 4D rotations which preserve two of the coordinates while rotating the

other two. For instance the orthogonal matrices inducing rotations that preserve x0, x3 or

x1, x2 are respectively

When right multiplied by the column vector of the coordinates these special matrices rotate

two coordinates by an angle θ while preserving the other two coordinates.

Group SO(4) is doubly covered by group SU(2)

SU(2) in a similar way to the double

covering of SO(3) by SU(2) [10]; this suggests that we can replace Pauli σ matrices by Dirac

The set of 16 Dirac matrices describes 15-dimensional space in the same way as the

set of 4 Pauli matrices describes 3-dimensional space. The source equation and the 4D

Helmholtz equation don’t require this high dimensionality because they can be associated

to 4D rotations and hence to group SU(2)

SU(2), which can be represented by Dirac

×
matrices if appropriate relations are introduced between its elements, eﬀectively reducing

the dimensionality from 15 to 4. The problem we will be facing is more complex, however

because the source equation is obtainable from a ﬁrst order equation in much the same way

as Klein-Gordon equation can be obtained from Dirac equation; the process is the same that

Relation (21) is used for the construction of sµ. This is a more general procedure than was

used in Ref. [1].

Applying the operator isµ

∇µ to both members, and assuming the condition

the space metric of Eq. (1) generated by the sµ matrices is:

∇σsµ = 0,

gµν = sµsν.

The condition imposed by Eq. (37) automatically veriﬁes Riemann’s condition

∇σgµν = 0

although the converse is not necessarily true.

There is an apparent inconsistency in Eq. (38) because sµsν

= sνsµ and thus the metric is

deﬁned as a non-symmetric tensor of 4

4 matrix elements. However, in many circumstances,

×

as will be the case in this section, the metric will be anti-symmetric and cancellation between

corresponding terms will allow a diagonal metric to be used.

Consider here expressions of the type gµν

∇µν, which imply an addition over all the µν
combinations; since the terms µν and νµ are symmetric and cancel each other, the expression

is equivalent to what would be obtained with a diagonal metric. In index raising or lowering

operations it is not indiﬀerent whether the metric is symmetric or anti-symmetric; we will al-

ways consider the metric to be deﬁned by Eq. (38) followed by elimination of anti-symmetric

elements, making this elimination an integral part of dynamic space construction.

simplicity we start by examining the situations where p0 = m, pj = 0; equation (33) is

strong links with octonions [11]: Assuming justiﬁable special rules on matrix multiplication

that will ensure non-associativity as required by the algebra, we can deﬁne an octonion basis

as follows

(46)

The multiplication table for octonions can be inferred from Fig. 1 where the arrows indicate

directions of forward cycling, i.e. directions where sign is maintained; for instance e1e2 = e4

or e4e6 = e3. In the reverse direction the sign of the result is negative.

1. remove all normalization factors,

These numbers cannot be associated to transformations of 4-space because they involve all

dimension is lower than 15 but this is a subject which needs profound research which is

beyond the scope of the present work. Some insight into the sort of transformations induced

Considering all the particular situation ψ = exp(iθα1/2) and applying a similarity transfor-

mation coordinates x0, x1, x4 and x5 are preserved while the other coordinates are trans-

x′3 =

x2 sin θ + x3 cos θ,

−
x′6 = x6 cos θ

x7 sin θ,

−

x′7 = x6 sin θ + x7 cos θ.

If the other iαj units were tested we would ﬁnd the sets (x1, x2, x3) and (x5, x6, x7) to undergo

rotations of opposite sign. We are thus led to assume that coordinates x0 to x3 and x4 to x7

are interrelated, reducing the space dimension to 11; this is not an unexpected dimension

and is coincident with what is used by superstring theory [12]. Transformations involving

any of the u0 units are more complex, involving all the elements of the coordinate matrix.

Considering pj = 0 in Eq. (47), the unitary hypercomplex numbers represented through

the imaginary units of Eq. (46) have the form

(cid:18)
where θ = 2p0x0 is an arbitrary real number. If the upper left quarter of the coordinate

matrix represents 4-space, as in (48), these numbers represent 2 coordinate preserving trans-

formations in the cases of e1, e2, e3, 1 coordinate preserving transformations in the cases of

e4, e5, e7 and no coordinate preserving transformations in the case of e6. These numbers can

be classiﬁed according to the signs of p and qj, and according to the number of non-zero qj.
For each sign of p there is one hypercomplex number for (nq)2 equal to 3 and 3 hypercomplex
numbers for (nq)2 either 1 or 2.

There is another unexplored possibility for the 0th imaginary unit which consist of mak-

ing u0 = iα0; this generates yet a diﬀerent sort of transformation analogous to a global

harmonic pulsation of the whole 4-space. Consider ψ = exp(iα0θ/2 and apply a similarity

transformation to the coordinate matrix; all the elements in the upper left quarter, those

representing 4-space, will appear multiplied by cos θ.

These generalized complex numbers will be used in the present and following sections to

write solutions of the ﬁrst order and source equations. We may have used some discretion

in choosing the mathematical entities we deﬁned as 4D complex numbers; we were guided

in this choice by need to make a connection with elementary particles later on.

The source equation (1) can become extremely intricate; this is to be expected, since it

is applicable to all the problems of dynamics. The exposition of this section will be made

clearer by a preliminary exploration of the 4D Helmholtz equation’s solutions using the 4D

complexes introduced above. Consider Eq. (23) with j and k indices replaced by µ and ν in

order to make it 4-dimensional

Just as in the 3D case, this equation accepts complex solutions of the type ψ =

δµνpµpν = m2.

(51)

(52)

We are interested in exploring 4D complex solutions of the form given by Eq. (41); no matter

which choice is made for u0, it will always be possible to write a solution in the form of Eq.

(45) with Condition (52) veriﬁed. This solution represents a spin 1/2 wave in the direction

of the unit 4-vector ˆp whose components are pµ/m; m is also the wave frequency along

the direction ˆp; in 4D we will associate the designation Compton frequency to the wave

frequency. The 4D wave is made up of two components: One 3-space component generated

(pj)2, corresponding to the De Broglie frequency, and
by the 3 elements pj, with frequency
one component in the direction x0, with frequency p0, corresponding to a transformation
that does not preserve x0. When u0 = iα0 the x0 wave induces a pulsation of 4-space, as

P

referred.

In this section we want to explore the simplest possible forms of the source equation,

together with its solutions. The form of the equation is governed by the metric which

includes an inertial component and a ﬁeld component; we will assume here the latter to be

the identity matrix, so we will limit ourselves to identifying the recursion mechanism which

determines the inertia component.

If we consider 4D complexes deﬁned by Eq. (41), a subsequent application of Eqs. (34)

as the metric to be used in the source equation.

Leaving aside the anti-symmetry conditions, having assumed the norm to be constant,

and noting that a constant metric zeroes the Christoﬀel symbols allowing the covariant

derivatives to be replaced by partial ones, the source equation (1) becomes the 4D Helmholtz

equation (51). Apart from a phase factor, this equation allows solutions of the type given

by Eq. (41) with Condition (52) met and with diagonal modulus. If we want not only the

source equation but also the ﬁrst order equation (33) to be veriﬁed, then the modulus is

given by Eq. (44).

III. A PHYSICAL EVALUATION OF THE MASSIVE PARTICLE SOLUTIONS

What is specially interesting about 4-dimensional standing waves in comparison to their

3D counterparts is that there are diﬀerent sorts, according to the imaginary unit u0 that

is chosen. Looking at the octonion basis (46), elements (e1, e2, e3) identify transformations

where 2 of the 3-space coordinates are preserved, elements (e4, e5, e7) refer to transforma-

tions preserving only one 3-space coordinate and element e6 4D combined transformations

involving all 3-space coordinates. For the 7 possible u0 choices that form an octonion basis

the concept of octonion units can be extended to the waves they generate, suggesting that

Elementary Particles as Solutions of a 4-Dimensional Source Equation

18

octonion products performed among 4D waves may describe particles involved in chromo-

dynamics. The diﬀerent possible choices for u0, including iα0, point to the interpretation

that Eq. (45) represents 8 particles and their respective anti-particles, with this solution

describing the known elementary particle dynamics. While the equations have so far been

written as pure numbers, dimensions and physical interpretation are possible through the

use of dimensional factors introduced in Ref. [1].

Returning to Eq. (45), assume that p1 = p2 = 0 so that the particle moves along the x3
direction. We have m2 = (p0)2 + (p3)2 and the ﬁrst thing we notice is that the frequency (p0)
of the x0 wave is reduced as (p3) increases, i. e. the transformation involving x0 with 1, 2 or
3 spatial coordinates, is transferred to rotation around x3. Secondly we notice that the De

Broglie frequency is p3 with spin frequency of twice that value; we refer to this fact saying

that the particle has spin 1/2; actually the spin can also be

1/2 when the sign factor s is

negative. Rewriting Eq. (45) for a stationary particle, deﬁned by pj = 0, whose u0 is chosen

among the octonion basis elements

ψ =

(cid:18)

,

(cid:19)

(55)

we identify the particle’s mass as m, connecting it with the norm of the particle’s wave

function; for a stationary particle the mass coincides with the frequency of the x0 wave.

The particle’s electric charge can be deﬁned as

qj/3 and comes from the transformation
involving the 0th coordinate through one octonion unit. For this reason, when (nq)2 equals

P

1 or 3, we will choose negative rather than positive qj, thereby allowing the electric charge

to be

1 when n2

q = 3. Such a particle can be then associated with an electron.

−

The electric charge is +2/3 when n2

q = 2 and
up and down quarks, respectively [2, 13]. Color charge is associated with the various qj 6
possibilities and we can see that electric charge appears as a spherically symmetric color

q = 1, corresponding to the

1/3 when n2

= 0

−

charge. Anti-particles are in turn represented by an equation identical to Eq. (55) where the

sign of the qj’s is reversed. The interpretation made above shows that Eq. (55) has all the

necessary features to represent all leptons and quarks with the exception of neutrinos, with

the particle’s mass being the only free parameter. It is of course desirable to remove all free

parameters, deriving mass from some characteristics of the source equation’s solutions, but

we will not address the subject in this paper.

We are going to associate neutrinos with the u0 = iα0 situation; as for the other particles,

Elementary Particles as Solutions of a 4-Dimensional Source Equation

19

the neutrinos’ masses appear as free parameters.

IV. SOLUTIONS WITH ZERO NORM - THE QUESTION OF MASSLESS PAR-

can be rearranged as

Whenever

It is important to investigate solutions of Eq. (51) when m = 0 noting that the equation

∇00ψ = ω2ψ
and covariant derivatives can be replaced by partial ones, the equation above becomes the

(57)

3D Helmholtz equation (23), for which there are plane wave solutions of the type given by

Eq. (24), i. e. no-spin waves. Being in 4D, integration of Eq. (57) has to be made with ψ as

a 4

4 matrix; after integration we get

where h is an Hermitian unit and ψ1,2,3 is a 4

4 matrix function of the 3 spatial coordinates.

(59)

with C an Hermitian matrix integration constant.

Physical interpretation of Eq. (59) reveals a plane wave restricted to 3D space and evanes-

cent in the 0th dimension, if the positive sign is rejected. The phenomenon of evanescent

waves is well known from total reﬂection and waveguides, where both exponent signs are also

present but the positive sign is ignored for lack of physical signiﬁcance. Here we interpret

the solutions given by Eq. (59) as representing massless particles, of which we distinguish

three diﬀerent types according to the Hermitian unit h that is present: An Hermitian unit

obtained from the octonion basis element e6 by product with i carries electric charge in the

evanescent wave and will be associated to photons; an Hermitian unit obtained from one of

the other octonion basis elements by product with i carries color charge in the evanescent

wave and will be associated to gluons; ﬁnally the Hermitian unit α0 carries no charge and

will be discussed later in this section.

Elementary Particles as Solutions of a 4-Dimensional Source Equation

20

Some words are needed here about the reason why we chose no-spin wave solutions for Eq.

(56) while spin 1/2 solutions exist. We could argue that spin 1/2 solutions cannot coexist in

the ground state due to the Pauli exclusion principle, but we can do better than that: A no-

spin wave deﬁnes a direction in 4-space but not a worldline; this is true both for dynamic or

observer space. On the contrary, the observer space appearance of a spin 1/2 wave is similar

to a 4-dimensional waveguide and it deﬁnes a worldline coinciding with the waveguide axis;

this idea was ﬁrst suggested in Ref. [4]. The number of cycles along any waveguide length is

actually a measure of time interval in the waveguide’s (or particle’s) own clock. We can also

assume all clocks in all waveguides to be synchronized from a common ”zero time” in the

origin of the Universe. When two waveguides meet in the same 3D position and their time

measurement coincides they have to interact; Ref. [14] includes the discussion of a collision

problem in 4-dimensional optics, which is an illustration of this fact. The same does not

happen with no-spin waves which never actually meet in one position because they are not

associated to lines and this matches the behavior of massless particles. The interpretation

of time as the count of cycles along the waveguide is entirely compatible with the use of dt

as line element that we make in the next section.

A superposition of an even number of

1/2 spin waves has many characteristics of a

±

no-spin wave; consider for instance the superposition of 2 equal modulus equal frequency

+1/2 spin waves with diﬀerent phase, both spinning around the x1 direction:

ψ =

ψ

|

|

eiα1ωx1

+ eiα1(ωx1+ρ)

;

i

(60)

it is suﬃcient to make ρ = π for the equation above to degenerate into a no-spin wave

given by ψ =

ψ

cos(ωx1)I; naturally the same could be done if the two waves were counter-

|

|

spinning or with any even number of waves co- or counter-spinning. The spin of any wave

will thus be expressed by the algebraic sum of the superposed waves spins.

All solutions verifying Eq. (59) have complex dependence on the spatial coordinates,

not quaternionic-like solutions. As we said before, complex numbers describe no-spin waves,

whereby these solutions all exhibit no spin. Only combinations of an even number of particles

with spin 1/2 can then lead to integral spin waves, behaving like no-spin ones. We shall

examine this case next.

We know from experiment that photons are associated to the annihilation of an electron

and a positron; since we have established the wavefunctions of the intervening particles it is

(61)

elucidating to investigate how the annihilation process can be understood in terms of those

wavefunctions. The wavefunctions of an electron and a positron are given by

ψ− = ime6e−sme6x0+ipjαj xj
ψ+ = ime6esme6x0+ipkαkxk

;

,

where e6 is the octonion basis element corresponding to electron and positron and the

exponent sign designates each particle’s electric charge; the sign of s stands for the two

possible spin orientations. By adding an ime6x0 term within both exponents to represent

the coupling between spins and multiplying the two wave functions we get

In the ﬁrst stage of the process (62), the two particles are assumed to interact by means of

the ix0 terms in the exponents; in the second stage (62′) an intermediate particle is formed,

which absorbs the result from the annihilation in the pj; the superposition of the two waves
. Finally the third stage (62′′) produces 2 identical photons of spin 1

and frequency equal to the mass of one particle. The ﬁnal result is a solution of Eq. (56),

representing a superposition of 3D spin waves, evanescent in the x0 direction. As before

only a negative evanescent exponent is acceptable and since s can have both signs the sense

of the mutual orbiting must change according to the spin sign.

The annihilation of two neutrinos, if at all possible, leads to a similar expression, where

ie6 is replaced by α0; the resulting particles are

actions and we do not dare proposing an interpretation for it, although it might be related

to dark matter in the Universe.

Returning to Eq. (62), further annihilation is possible through the interaction of two ψ−ψ+

pairs with opposing evanescent exponent signs s. We rejected the positive sign for its lack

of physical signiﬁcance, however two pairs with opposite signs produce pure 3-dimensional

Elementary Particles as Solutions of a 4-Dimensional Source Equation

waves, not accompanied by any x0 evanescence; these waves are the superposition of 4

wavefunctions and thus have spin 2. Four identical particles with mass m can be annihilated

We believe these are good candidates for gravitons which may have been detected ex-

already discussed by the author [16].

V. SOLUTIONS WITH FIELDS

In sections III and IV we discussed ﬁeld free solutions of the source equation in situations

which reduced that equation to the 4D Helmholtz equation; those solutions where found to

have characteristics which suggested their physical interpretation as massive and massless

particles. However the real test of this interpretation relies on the ability of the particles

thus deﬁned to react properly to applied ﬁelds, accurately predicting the dynamics of those

particles. Fields are assumed to alter the particle’s dynamic space through the sµ matrices

deﬁned in Eq. (34). The exact way in which ﬁelds are created is not yet clearly understood

but we believe it is connected to the ﬂux of massless particles; we think that the ﬂux of

massless particles determines the ﬁeld gradient, the net value of the ﬂux being linked to the

norm of the ﬁeld gradient and the ﬂux direction to its direction. Things get more compli-

cated when massless particles are originated in moving frames because an extra rotational

factor intervenes. The whole process will eventually be governed by equations similar to

Maxwell’s equations albeit generalized to encompass the three ﬁeld types: gravitational,

electromagnetic and color. In the following exposition ﬁelds are presented axiomatically and

the dynamics they induce are then seen to represent dynamics under the inﬂuence of gravity

and electromagnetism; a loose association is made with the massless particles identiﬁed in

the previous section but no attempt is made to propose a formal link between particle ﬂux

and ﬁeld gradient, which we intend to do in a future paper.

We are going to assume that ﬁelds leave the particle wavefunction ψ virtually unaltered,

so that we can use the wavefunctions derived previously; this means that we can make

= imu0 and

ψ

It will frequently be convenient to write the modulus in the

Eq. (33) maintains its validity and by applying to both members the operator isµ

the source equation (1) with gµν deﬁned by Eq. (38) as before.

In a general situation the metric deﬁned by Eq. (38) can be expanded to

This metric will now have to be examined for various possible forms of Gµ and Aµ and

gjk =

the respective dynamics related to known interactions. Simultaneously a connection will be

made to the massless particles identiﬁed in the previous section in order to associate them

with mediators of the various interactions.

The simplest case to examine is of course the one where all the Aµ are zero and the

Gµ coeﬃcients are all equal, Gµ = G/4; inserting into Eq. (66), the metric becomes anti-

symmetric and we can reduce it to the diagonal metric

This metric deﬁnes a space whose geodesics reproduce the dynamics of a particle with mass

m in a gravitational ﬁeld G, as long as the ﬁeld sources are stationary. This problem was

analyzed in Ref. [1] and will be reproduced below for completeness.

Inserting Eq. (67) into Eq. (1), with ψ given by Eq. (41) and assuming G to be a slowly

varying function so that the Christoﬀel symbols can be neglected

Here we remind the reader that although we have chosen the letter t for the line element,

this is in no way associated with time at this stage; the procedure whereby this association

can be made later on was detailed in Ref. [1].

The equation above is called a dynamic space equation because the inertia element m is

present in the metric; it can be converted into an observer space equation by the coordinate

change X µ = mxµ. We can then write

˙X 0
G2 =

The procedure to derive the 4 geodesic equations from Eq. (70) can be found in many

textbooks, for instance [17]. We deﬁne a constant Lagrangian with the value 1/2 and insert

into the second member of Eq. (70) which becomes 2L. Following that, we derive the Euler-

Lagrange equations in a standard way.

If G is independent from coordinate X 0 there is

conservation of the corresponding conjugate momentum

with γ an arbitrary constant. For the other 3 coordinates we can write

The reader is now referred to Ref. [1] in order to verify that in the particular case of a single

body of mass M as origin of the ﬁeld introduced in Eq. (65), one must make G = exp(

M/r),

−

with r the distance between the two masses, thereby giving a clue that ln G is the Newtonian

gravitational ﬁeld. In the cited reference it was also demonstrated that predictions of general

relativity are veriﬁed to the ﬁrst order approximation by the equations above.

The link of gravitational interaction introduced in Eq. (65) with the graviton equation

(64) can be made by noting that both G and graviton’s modulus are products of the identity

matrix by a scalar; it is thus arguable that the gravitational ﬁeld can be mediated by such

particles.

Next we want to investigate the adequacy of function ψ to represent the electrodynamics

of a charged particle. We start by taking G as unity and

Aµ = ie6Aµ,

(73)

(74)

(75)

(76)

with Aµ scalar; we will also assume that u0 =

electron/positron family members. As a result the exponentials exp(

Equations (84) and (85) represent the Lorentz force exerted by the magnetic ﬁeld B3 over
a particle of electric charge q and moving with velocity ˙xj. The frequency qB3/(mγ) is the

angular frequency of the movement.

In the limit γ = 1 and ˙xj = 0 the particle approach breaks down because this approach

is similar to the geometric or ray approach of optics and cannot be used when any features

of the worldline are of the same order of magnitude as the particle’s Compton wavelength.

If we take q =

Similarly to the relation of gravitons with the gravitational ﬁeld, photons can be seen

as related to the EM ﬁeld by their modulus when comparing Eq. (73) with Eq. (62). In

both cases there is an exponent which can interact with the exponent in the wavefunction

modulus; photons can be considered as mediators of this ﬁeld. Naturally relations like Eq.

(73) can be established for the other octonion basis elements, originating the color ﬁelds and

chromodynamics; this is a subject for a forthcoming paper.

We cannot end this analysis without touching upon the situation where the Gµ diﬀer

from each other; this must surely be related to gravity, since we have seen how gravitational

ﬁeld is modelled by equal coeﬃcients. We presume at this point that diﬀerent Gµ’s must

be associated with mass currents in a similar way to what relates the Vµ’s to electrical

currents. This would mean that diﬀerent Gµ coeﬃcients model situations of non-stationary

gravitational sources. As we said at the beginning of this section, it is believed that a set

of coupled diﬀerential equations links the components of each ﬁeld and that these equations

are a generalization of Maxwell’s equations; we will investigate this possibility also in a

forthcoming paper.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK

Massive and non-massive wave-particles have been found as solutions of a 4-dimensional

source equation. Those solutions were identiﬁed as 4D standing waves and may be related to

the probability waves of quantum mechanics by a switch from the pseudo-Euclidean space

used in this work to the more traditional hyperbolic space-time. The character of their

dynamical symmetry has been found to follow that of elementary particles, leaving mass as

the only free parameter. Electric and color charge result directly from rotational symmetry

properties in 4D of standing waves, and massive particles were shown to verify the laws

of dynamics following geodesics of a suitably deﬁned 4-space. The physical origin of spin

has been identiﬁed without appeal to Relativity principles, and found to result merely from

Helmholtz equation requirements in 4D. The modiﬁcations to the source equation needed to

express the complete dynamics were loosely tied to the character of massless particles, this

being an area of further development as detailed below.

Two complementary lines of future work are envisaged, following paths only suggested in

the present work. The ﬁrst line will try to complete the set of recursive equations, deriving

ﬁelds from particle densities and currents in dynamic and observer space, and in particular

deriving chromodynamics. As a mere working hypothesis we believe that a composite ﬁeld

can be deﬁned as

φµ = GµαµeAµ,

(summation is suppressed)

(89)

where Gµ represents the contribution from gravitational sources both stationary and non-

stationary and Aµ represents both electromagnetic and color ﬁelds, as discussed in the

previous section. The composite ﬁeld will then be related to the ﬂux of massless particles

by a composite ﬁeld tensor deﬁned by

which is expected to verify relations similar to Maxwell’s equations, namely

Fµν = ∂µφµ −

∂νφν,

∂λFµν + ∂νFλµ + ∂µFνλ = 0,

∂µFµν = Jν.

(90)

(91)

(92)

These are untested hypothesis and must be seen only as a working program.

The second line of work will be a search for variable norm solutions of the source equation.

Preliminary work has already shown that allowance for a variable norm and the consequent

consideration of Christoﬀel symbols can send the source equation into some modiﬁed forms of

Emden-Fowler equation [18] which can determine mass, thus eliminating the only remaining

free parameter.

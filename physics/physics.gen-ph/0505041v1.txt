Where and how does it happen ?

Abstract

It has for ages been a rather constant feature of thinking in science
to take it for granted that the respective thinking happens in realms
which are totally outside and independent of all the other phenomena
that constitute the objects of such thinking. The imposition of this
divide on two levels may conﬂict with basic assumptions of Newtonian
and Einsteinian mechanics, as well as with those in Quantum Mechan-
ics.

1. Conﬂict with Newtonian mechanics

Instant action at arbitrary distance, such as in the case of gravita-
tion, is one of the basic assumptions of Newtonian mechanics. This
certainly does not appear to conﬂict with the fact that we can think
instantly and simultaneously about phenomena which are no matter
how far apart from one another in space or in time.
However, absolute space is also a basic assumption of Newtonian me-
chanics. And it is supposed to contain absolutely everything that may
exist in Creation, be it in the past, present or future. Consequently, it
is supposed to contain, among others, the physical body of the think-
ing scientist as well.

Yet it is not equally clear whether it also contains scientiﬁc thinking
itself which, traditionally, is assumed to be totally outside and inde-

1

pendent of all phenomena under its consideration, therefore in partic-
ular, of the Newtonian absolute space, and also, of absolute time.

And then the question arises : where and how does such a scientiﬁc
thinking take place or happen ?

2. A diﬀerence with Mathematics

Mathematical thinking, especially in its modern and abstract variants,
does not appear to need the assumption of any absolute space, or for
that matter, absolute time. Such thinking may appear to unfold dur-
ing appropriate local time intervals. However, when seen all in itself,
and unrelated to the physical body of the respective mathematician,
it is quite likely that such thinking has no location in any space, be it
relative or absolute.

3. Conﬂict with Einsteinian mechanics

In Einsteinian mechanics a basic assumption is that there cannot be
any propagation of action faster than light.
Yet just like in the case we happen to think in terms of Newtonian
mechanics, our thinking in terms of Einsteinian mechanics can again
instantly and simultaneously be about phenomena no matter how far
apart from one another in space or time.

Consequently, the question arises : given the mentioned relativistic
limitation, how and where does such a thinking happen ?

4. Conﬂict with Quantum Mechanics

Let us consider the classical EPR, or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entan-
glement phenomenon, and for simplicity, do so in the terms of quantum
computation. For that purpose it suﬃces to consider double qubits,
that is, elements of C2 ⊗ C2, such as for instance the EPR pair

2

| ω 00 > = | 0, 0 > + | 1, 1 > =

(4.1)

= | 0 > ⊗ | 0 > + | 1 > ⊗ | 1 > ∈ C2 ⊗ C2

which is well known to be entangled, in other words, | ω 00 > is not of
the form

( α | 0 > + β | 1 > ) ⊗ ( γ | 0 > + δ | 1 > ) ∈ C2 ⊗ C2

for any α, β, γ, δ ∈ C.

Here we can turn to the usual and rather picturesque description used
in Quantum Computation, where two ﬁctitious personages, Alice and
Bob, are supposed to exchange information, be it of classical or quan-
tum type.
Alice and Bob can each take their respective qubit from the entangled,
or EPR pair of qubits | ω 00 >, and then go away with it no matter
how far apart from one another. And the two qubits thus separated
in space will remain entangled, unless of course one or both of them
get involved in further classical or quantum interactions.
For clarity, however, we should note that the single qubits which Alice
and Bob take away with them from the EPR pair | ω 00 > are neither
one of the terms | 0, 0 > or | 1, 1 > in (4.1), since both these are
themselves already pairs of qubits, thus they cannot be taken away
as mere single qubits, either by Alice, or by Bob. Consequently, the
single qubits which Alice and Bob take away with them cannot be
described in any other form, except that which is implicit in (4.1).

Now, after that short detour into the language of Quantum Com-
putation, we can note that, according to Quantum Mechanics, the
entanglement in the EPR double qubit | ω 00 > implies that the states
of the two qubits which compose it are correlated, no matter how far
from one another Alice and Bob would be with them. Consequently,
knowing the state of one of these two qubits can give information
about the state of the other qubit.
On the other hand, in view of General, or even Special Relativity, such
a knowledge, say by Alice, cannot be communicated to Bob faster than
the velocity of light.

3

And yet, anybody who is familiar enough with Quantum Mechanics,
can instantly know and understand all of that, no matter how far away
from one another Alice and Bob may be with their respective single
but entangled qubits.

So that, again, the question arises : how and where does such a think-
ing happen ?

constant of the universe: Gamow’s relation revisited as a special case

(Dated: July 16, 2014)

Considering our expanding universe as made up of gravitationally interacting particles which
describe particles of luminous matter and dark matter and dark energy which is described by a
repulsive harmonic potential among the points in the ﬂat 3-space, we derive a quantum mechanical
relation connecting, temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, age, and cosmo-
logical constant of the universe. When the cosmological constant is zero, we get back the Gamow’s
relation with a much better coeﬃcient. Otherwise, our theory predicts a value of the cosmological
−2 when the present values of cosmic microwave background temperature
constant 2.234 10
of 2.728 K and age of the universe 14 billion years are taken as input.

INTRODUCTION

The most important theory for the origin of the uni-
verse is the Big Bang Theory1 according to which the
present universe is considered to have started with a huge
explosion from a superhot and a superdense stage. Theo-
retically one may visualize its starting from a mathemati-
cal singularity with inﬁnite density. This also comes from
the solutions of the type I and type II form of Einstein’s
ﬁeld equations2. What follows from all these solutions
is that the universe has originated from a point where
the scale factor R (to be identiﬁed as the radius of the
universe) is zero at time t = 0, and its derivative with
time is taken to be inﬁnite at this time. That is, it is
thought that the initial explosion had happened with in-
ﬁnite velocity, although, it is impossible for us to picture
the initial moment of the creation of the universe. The
accelerated expansion of the universe has been conformed
by studying the distances to supernovae of type Ia3,4. For
the universe, it is being said that the major constituent of
the total mass of the present universe is made of the Dark
Energy 76%, Dark Matter about 20% and luminous mat-
ter 4%. The Dark energy is responsible for the acceler-
ated expansion of the universe since it has negative pres-
sure and produces repulsive gravity. The cosmological
constant5,6 of Einstein provides a repulsive force when its
value is small and positive. In the classical big-bang cos-
mology there is no dynamical theory7 to relate the cosmo-
logical constant to any other physical variable of the uni-
verse. There have been some studies8,9,10 regarding the
universe to relate the space-time manifold to somekind of
condensed matter systems. Here by considering11,12 the
visible universe made up of self-gravitating particles rep-
resenting luminous baryons and dark matter such as neu-
trinos ( though only a small fraction) which are fermions
and a repulsive potential describing eﬀect of Dark Energy
responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe,
we in this paper derive quantum mechanically a relation
connecting temperature , age and cosmological constant
of the universe. When the cosmological constant is zero,
we get back Gamow’s relation with a much better coeﬃ-

cient. Otherwise using as input the the current values of
109years, we predict the value
T = 2.728K and t = 14
of cosmological constant as 2.234 10−56cm−2. Note that
Λ is a completely free parameter in General Theory of
Relativity. Also it is interesting to note that the we get
the sign of the parameter correct though it is a very small
number.

II. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION
WITHOUT THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT Λ

We in this section derive a relation connecting tem-
perature and age of the universe when cosmological con-
stant is zero, by considering a Hamiltonian11,12,13 used
by us some time back for the study of a system of self-
gravitating particles which is given as:

2.728K, it lies in the neighbourhood of al-
radiation is
most zero temperature. We,therefore, use the zero tem-
perature formalism for the study of the present problem.
Under the situation N is extremely large, the total ki-
netic energy of the system is obtained as

where ρ( ~X) denotes the single particle density to ac-
count for the distribution of particles (fermions) within
the system, which is considered to be a ﬁnite one. Eq.(2)
has been written in the Thomas-Fermi approximation.

The total potential energy of the system, in the Hartree-
approximation, is now given as

to λ. This is how, we are able to ﬁnd the total energy of
the system corresponding to its lowest energy state.

Inorder to evaluate the integral in Eq.(2) and Eq.(3), we
had chosen a trial single-particle density11,12 ρ( ~X) which
was of the form :

ρ( ~X) =

Ae−x

After evaluating the integrals in Eq.(2), Eq.(3), we ﬁnd

the total energy E(λ) of the system which is given as

(5)

We minimize the total energy with respect to λ. Dif-
ferentiating this with respect to λ and then equating it
with zero, we obtain the value of λ at which the minimum
occurs. This is found as:

(4)

where x = (r/λ)1/2, λ being the variational parameter.
As one can see from Eq.(4), ρ( ~X) is singular at the origin.
This looks to be consistent with the concept behind the
Big Bang theory of the universe. The early universe was
not only known to be super hot, but also it was super-
dense. To account for the scenario at the time of the Big
Bang, we have, therefore, imagined of a single-particle
density ρ(x) for the system which is singular at the ori-
gin (r = 0). This is only true at the microscopic level,
which is not so meaningful looking at things macroscop-
ically. Although ρ(x) is singular, the number of particles
N, in the system is ﬁnite. Since the present universe has
a ﬁnite size, its present density which is nothing but an
average value is ﬁnite. At the time of Big Bang (t = 0),
since the scale factor (identiﬁed as the radius of the uni-
verse) is supposed to be zero, the average density of the
system can assume an inﬁnitely large value, implying its
superdense state. Having thought of a singular form
of single-particle density at the time of the Big Bang,
we have tried with a number of singular form of single
particle densities of the kind ρ(~r) = A exp[−( r
where
λ )3ν
( r
ν = 1, 2, 3, 4...or 1
3 , 1
4 , .... Integer values of ν are not
permissible because they make the normalization con-
stant inﬁnite. Out of the fractional values, ν = 1
2 is found
to be most appropriate, because, it has been shown in our
earlier paper that it gives the expected upper limit for
the critical mass of a neutron star11 beyond which black
hole formation takes place and other paramaters of the
universe12 satisfactorily correct. Also because if ν goes
to zero (like 1/n, n
), ρ(r) would tend to the case of
a constant density as found in an inﬁnite many-fermion
system. In view of the arguments put forth above, one
will have to think that the very choice of our ρ(r) is a kind
of ansatz in our theory, which is equivalent to the choice
of a trial wave function used in the quantum mechanical
calculation for the binding energy of a physical system
following variational techniques. As mentioned earlier,
singularity at r = 0 in the single particle distribution has
nothing to do with the average particle density in the
system, which happens to be ﬁnite ( because of the fact
that N is ﬁnite and volume V of the universe is ﬁnite),
and hence it is not going to aﬀect the large scale spatial
homogeneity of the observed universe. Having accepted
the value ν = 1

determined after minimizing E(λ) =< H > with respect

by us earlier12, is given as

R0 = 2λ0 = 4.047528(

(8)

~2
mg2 )/N 1/3

Our identiﬁcation about the radius R of the star with
2λ0 is based on the use of socalled quantum mechanical
tunneling14 eﬀect. Classically, it is well known that a
particle has a turning point where the potential energy
becomes equal to the total energy. Since the kinetic en-
ergy and therefore the velocity are equal to zero at such
a point, the classical particle is expected to be turned
around or reﬂected by the potential barrier. From the
present theory it is seen that the turning point occurs at
a distance R = 2λ0.

After invoking Mach’s principle6, which is expressed
through the relation ( GM
1, and using the fact that
≈
the total mass of the universe M = N m, we are able to
obtain the total number of particles N constituting the
universe, as

pression for R0, as

R0 = 2.8535954(

As one can see from above, R0 is of a form which involves
only the fundamental constants like ~, c, G and m. Now,
eliminating N from Eq.(7), by virtue of Eq.(9),we have

Let us now assume that the radius R0 of the universe

is approximately given by the relation

The variation of mass m with time is not incompatible
with the fact that our theory is not relativistically invari-
ant and recently a variation of ratio of mass of proton to
mass of electron has been observed15 which shows that
mass of elementary particle has changed with time since
the Big Bang. A substitution of m, from the above equa-
tion, in Eq.(11), enables us to write

This is exactly the Gamow’s relation7,13 apart from

tuting the numerical value of aB, which is equal to
10−15 erg cm−3K −4 , and the present value

If we accept the age of the universe to be close to
109yr, which we have used here, with the help of
14
Eq.(15), we arrive at a value for the cosmic background
3.5K. This is very close to the
temperature equal to
measured value of 2.728 K as reported from the most
recent Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite
measurements16,17. However, if we use Gamow’s rela-
tion, t = 956 billion years is required to obtain the exact
value of 2.728 K for the cosmic background temperature
from. Using our expression, Eq.(15), we would require
109 yr for the universe to get the ex-
an age of 22.832
act value of 2.728 K. Long back a correction was made
to Gamow’ relation by multiplying it with a factor of
( 2
)1/4 by taking into account the degeneracies of the
gd
particles, where gd = 9. This correction eﬀectively mul-
tiplies Gamow’relation with a factor of 0.68 and brings
back the age of the universe to 425 billion years for the
present CMBT. If we multiply our expression by the same
factor to correct for the degeneracy of particles, we obtain
a value of 2.4 K, which is less than the value of present
CMBT. In the next section we see that by including the
cosmic repulsion by the part given by cosmological con-
stant we get back 2.728 K, This is physically correct since
the cosmological term6 has the meaning of negative pres-
sure, it adds energy to the system by its tension when

the universe expands, though the over all temperature
decreases as the universe expands.

INCLUSION OF THE PART OF THE

HAMILTONIAN CORRESPONDING TO THE
COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT

The cosmological constant term5,6 Λ originally intro-
duced by Einstein when translated from the relativistic
to Newtonian picture gives rise to a repulsive harmonic
oscillator force per unit mass as (Λc2/3)~r between points
in space when Λ is positive. The energy corresponding
to this repulsive force can be written as:

IV. CONCLUSION

(24)

This is the central result of our paper. This relation con-
nects temperature T with time t and cosmological con-
stant Λ since Q is a function of t and u is also a function
of t and Λ. When Λ=0, we get back the relation Eq.(14)
connecting T and t. Since we know the current values of
109years, using Eq.(24), we
T = 2.728K and t = 14
solve for Λ. We do that by plotting the left hand side
and right hand side of Eq. (24) and ﬁnding the crossing
point. This gives Λ = 2.234 10−56 cm−2 which is the
value that has been guessed long back but here it has
been derived dynamically.

To conclude, we in this letter have derived a relation
connecting temperature, age and cosmological constant
of the universe by describing the universe as made up
of self-gravitating particles eﬀectively representing lumi-
nous matter, dark matter and dark energy represented
by the repulsive potential given by the cosmological con-
stant. When the cosmological constant is zero, we get
back Gamow’s relation with a better coeﬃcient. Other
wise our theory predicts the value of cosmological con-
stant as 2.234 10−56 cm−2. It is interesting to note that
in this ﬂat universe, our method dynamically determines
the value of the cosmological constant reasonably well
compared to General Theory of Relativity where the cos-
mological constant is a free parameter.

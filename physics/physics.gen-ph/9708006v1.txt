Abstract

The purpose of this contribution is to show how a nuclear ﬁeld theory follows
naturally from the structure of four–dimensional Riemannian geometry. A Yang–
Mills ﬁeld is introduced by constructing ﬁbres that include all possible exchanges
of spin, parity and charge such that the collective quantum numbers remain the
same. In this way O(4) internal symmetry transformations are found and a con-
nection is obtained by exponentiation of a CP–invariant operator C associated
with the ground state. The metric is Calabi–Yau and Einstein.
Carbon 13 is chosen as an example because it is the lightest nucleus to exhibit small
spin mutations even though there is no deformation parameter in the O(4) com-
mutation relations. Instead a supersymmetric transformation replaces a quantum
group. Mirror symmetry is also discussed.

1 Introduction

de Wet (1996) considered an example of how a Z2–graded algebra, speciﬁcally
the Lie algebra of O(4), leads naturally to the well known angular momentum
matrices σi of a coupled system of P protons and N neutrons, namely

σi = EN ⊗ P Γi + N Γi ⊗ EP , i = 1, 2, 3

(1)

1

where P Γi,N Γi are (P + 1)-, (N + 1) -dimensional Lie operators of so(3);
EP , EN are (P + 1), (N + 1) unit matrices.

Essentially a Z2-graded algebra splits a bundle Λ2 into the direct sum

of self-dual and anti-self-dual 2-forms respectively. An example of this grad-
ing is the decomposition

Λ2 = Λ2

+ + Λ2
−

so(4) ∼= so(3) + so(3)

(2)

(3)

into bundles of three-dimensional Lie algebras which were long ago identiﬁed
by de Wet (1971) with spin and isospin (based upon some ideas of Edding-
ton). In a seminal paper Atiyah et al. (1978) uses this decomposition on the
Lie group level to introduce, at least locally, the two complex spinor bun-
dles V+ and V− : the bundles of self-dual and anti-self-dual spinors. Then
V = V+ + V− is isomorphic to the complexiﬁed Cliﬀord algebra bundles of
one forms Λ1 (Eddington (1946) called the Cliﬀord algebra C4 a Sedenion
algebra and we will use his transparent Sedenion, or E-number, notation).

The purpose of this contribution is to show how a nuclear ﬁeld theory follows
naturally from the structure of four-dimensional Riemannian geometry and
to this end we shall consider the Hodge star mapping

∗ : Λ2 → Λ2

(4)

as transforming a nucleus into its mirror image i.e. (P, N) → (N, P ).

Under these conditions

spin(σ) → spin(σ) :

isospin(T3) → − isospin(T3)

(5)

are the self–dual and the self–anti–dual forms. An example is given by the
ﬁrst and fourth columns of Table I of section 3. (Here we have denoted parity
by p and the spin by s and in §2 we shall see how the nuclear charge–spin–
parity states are labelled by the partition [λ1λ2λ3λ4] of (A=N+P) and its
four permutations that appear in (18)). Furthermore Atiyah et. al. (1978)
consider the decomposition of the complexiﬁed Cliﬀord algebra bundle

Λ1 = Λ0

c + Λ1
c

2

c is the subspace Λ1,0 of (1, 0) forms that
such that the image of V− in Λ1
deﬁnes a complex structure of the kind considered by de Wet (1995,96).
Now a complex manifold in turn decomposes into a sum of the spaces Λ1,0
and Λ0,1 of (1, 0) and (0, 1) forms (Kobayashi and Nomizu(1969) ch. IX) so
it is natural to identify the space Λ0,1 with the self–dual form σ associated
with V+. Then its conjugate

πi = EN ⊗ P Γi − N Γi ⊗ EP (i = 1, 2, 3)

(6)

lies in Λ1,0 (Ibid). We shall see in §2 how π is parity but for the moment
simply observe that this deﬁnition is also consistent with Table I as described
in §3. The six operators σi, πi are generators of O(4).

Now a complex structure occurs only on fermions (odd A), the even A nuclei
being characterised by shell structure, and an example of the decomposition
of the 2 complex manifolds carrying 9Li, 9C is

9Li : 6 C[3303] = 34(σ + π) + 9(σπ2 + σ2π) + (σ3 + π3)

9C : 6 C[3033] = 34(σ − π) + 9(σπ2 − σ2π) + (σ3 − π3)

(7)

(8)

which is manifestly CP–symmetric because T3 → −T3 is accompanied by
π → −π. Equation (7) conﬁrms the decompositions given by Kobayashi and
Nomizu (1969) and Salamon (1989) where the Wigner coeﬃcients are the
number of times the irreducible spin representations

S1,1 = (σ + π), S2,1 = (σπ2 + σ2π), S3,0 = (σ3 + π3)

(9)

are contained in the subspaces Λ1,1 , Λ2,1 , Λ3,0 of Λ3 which are embedded
in the Cliﬀord algebra of the A coordinates of σ, π and their products (cf.
Lawson and Michelsohn (1989) for the isomorphism between Cliﬀord alge-
bras and exterior products).

An inspection of (7), (8) shows clearly that fermion CP-invariance follows
from the decompositions S1,1, S2,1, S3 of the complex manifold. Moreover
since such a decomposition applies only to the state [3303] we will associate
the ground state with the label [Λ] ≡ [Λ1Λ2Λ3Λ4]. Then higher energy states
will be labelled by [λ] ≡ [λ1λ2λ3λ4]. These, however, are characterized by
the decay of the ground state so can no longer be in a complex manifold.

3

In section 3 it will be shown that the fermion manifolds have a Ricci-ﬂat
Kaehler metric and are therefore Calabi–Yau. Recently there have been sev-
eral studies of the mirror symmetry of Calabi–Yau spaces (cf. e.g. Strominger
et. al. (1996)) but the mirror nuclear manifolds appear to be isomorphic. For
example, in section 3 the matrix representations of the CP–invariant opera-
tors C[4324], C[4234] of respectively 13C, :13 N are identical up to interchange of
rows and columns. These representations are derived by substituting (1),(6)
into the equations (36),(37) (which are the analogues of (7),(8)) and their
rotational eigenvalues C ′
[λ] appear in the last column of Table I. However we
can substitute directly in (36),(37) using (38) which is derived from a canoni-
cal labelling scheme suggested by (18) of section 2. Again this labelling gives
rise to an isomorphism with almost identical rotational eigenvalues C[λ] in
the penultimate column of Table I.

In fact there are only tiny spin mutations (marked by asterisks) associated
with the states [2533], [4333]] of 13C. As discussed in section 3 these are
believed to be due to Yang–Mills interaction even though the group O(4) has
no deformation parameter q in its commutation relations and is not a quan-
tum group. Instead interaction simply changes the spins of two neutrons in
paired states so we have replaced quantum group theory by supersymmetry!

In line with the aims of this contribution we have outlined several corre-
spondences between nuclear theory and the structure of Z2– graded algebras
which of course also plays a role in quantum group theory as outlined by
Manin(1991) chapter 4. We can now move on to how a Yang–Mills ﬁeld is
incorporated.

2 FIELD THEORY

The basic theory has been reviewed in section 1 of de Wet (1994) so only an
outline will be given here. The method used constructs tensor products in the
enveloping algebra A(γ) of the Dirac ring of an irreducible self–representation

Ψ = (iE4ψ1 + E23ψ2 + E14ψ3 + E05ψ4)e

(10)

with itself. Here Eddington’s E-numbers are related to to the Dirac matrices
by

γν = iEσν, Eµν = EσµEσν , E2

µν = −1, Eµν = −Eνµ µ < ν = 1, ..., 5

and the commuting operators E23, E14, E05 are respectively, independent in-
ﬁnitesimal rotations in 3–space, 4–space and isospace that correspond to the
spin σ, parity π, and charge T3 carried by a single nucleon. the parameters
ψ1, ψ2, ψ3 are half angles of rotation and e is a primitive idempotent of the
Dirac ring; E4 is the unit matrix.

A rotation of 180o about x will change spin up to spin down and if this
is followed by a rotation of 180o about t, x can go to −x without invert-
ing time, but instead changing to a left–handed coordinate system system.
Thus we associate the rotation E14 about x in 4–space with a parity rever-
sal E14 → −E14, and this way the time coordinate is ‘rolled up’ so that the
Lorentz-invariant representation (10) can describe a nucleon in 3–space.

The basis elements of A(γ) are the 4A × 4A matrices (A=N+Z)

El

µν = E4 ⊗ · · · ⊗ E4 ⊗ Eµν ⊗ E4 ⊗ · · · ⊗ E4

with Eµν in the lth position. The elements El

is a projection operator satisfying

[λ]ψ = P[λ]ψ, ψ ≡ ψ1ψ2ψ3ψ4.

Also ǫA = e ⊗ · · · ⊗ e = e1e2 · · · eA is a primitive idempotent in A(γ) so that
(18) has the same form for A nucleons as the basic representation (10).

By studying (18) it can be shown that a canonical labelling scheme asso-
ciates (λ3 + λ4) with the number of nucleons with a positive charge (i.e. the
ﬁrst two terms represent a nucleus and the last two terms its mirror image).
(λ2 + λ3) the number with a given spin σ, and (λ2 + λ4) with a particular
parity π. Thus each partition (17) represents a charge-spin-parity state of a
nucleus, and by choosing 4 × 4 matrix representations for E23, E14, E05 and
constructing ﬁbres that include every possible exchange of spin, parity and
charge between nucleons such that the collective quantum numbers remain
the same, it may be shown that C[λ] partitions beautifully into a de Rham
decomposition of isobaric multiplets. Under these conditions the 4A × 4A ma-
trices (11),(12) shrink to (1),(6) with rows labelled by the ﬁbres [λ]; where
σ1 = σ(A)

14 are two of the six generators σj, πj of O(4).

23 , π1 = σ(A)

In this way the nucleons interact by means of a Yang–Mills gauge ﬁeld which
can be determined by calculating the connections in the ﬁbre bundle. This
has been done by de Wet (1996) by exponentiating C[Λ] and ﬁnding the
Ricci–ﬂat Kaehler metric of the resulting Calabi–Yau space or torus. In §3

6

this will be shown to be Einstein which ties in with the ideas of Capovilla
et. al. (1990) that say that an SU(2) connection characterises a solution of
the source-free Einstein ﬁeld equations. In fact a compact 4–manifold acted
on by a group SU(2) must be a Ricci–ﬂat torus (cf. Salamon (1989) p.106).
In other words the nuclear metric is a solution of the source-free Einstein
equations!

From another point of view we can regard the Dirac algebra as the in-
ﬁnitesimal ring of Minkowski space and therefore as a tangent space to 4–
dimensional space–time in the spirit of Ashtekar (1988). The representations
of the tangent space that give us the internal symmetries σ, π, T are by con-
struction a soldering form (cf. Ashtekar et. al. (1988)) and exponentiation
must necessarily take us back to source–free Einstein space.

Returning to (16) the bases of the form Λλ2,λ3 are contained in C[λ] without
the E05 elements which as we shall see are needed only to characterise a par-
ticular member of an isobaric multiplet. Thus in the next section, where an
outline of the decomposition (7),(8) is given, it will become clear that a new
(p, q) subspace appears whenever the products σp

23), π0 = 2π1 = (E1

14 + · · · + EA
14)

(20)

contains terms with the same indices. Under these conditions p + q ≤ λ2 + λ3.

Although a general nuclear state is labelled by [λ], there is only one state
[Λ] = [λ1λ2λ3λ4] having the decomposition (7) associated with the ground
state. Then [Λ] itself carries carries all the spin–parity states [λ] of Table I.
These label the rows of a submatrix

#

(21)

of C[Λ] which has the holomorphic coordinates zk = +iλk where λk is the
eigenvalue associated with [λ]k by means of the correspondence (38) and is
real for the submatrix B.

In fact zk, zk characterize the horizontal subspace of a complex Grassmann or
Kaehler manifold (Kobayashi and Nomizu (1969), Chapter IX) and because

7

it is also Ricci-ﬂat and Kaehler it is a twistor space (using the deﬁnition of
Lawson and Michelsohn (1989) Chapter IV section 9). We shall see in §3
how a metric is obtained.

3 AN EXAMPLE: CARBON 13.

In this section the ideas already outlined will be brought together with an
example that exhibits spin mutation and at the same time illustrates in more
detail how the decomposition (7),(8) of a complex manifold is obtained.

The real quantum numbers s, p and T3 =
are

(Z − N) of spin, parity and charge

σ0 = 2is, π0 = 2ip, T0 = 2iT3 = i(Z − N)
which show how the quantum numbers of individual nucleons are additive.

An elementary example is

where P denotes summation over the A!/(A − n)! permutations of the n
generators in the bracket. Then

C[(A−2)101] = iA−2P (Ei

23Ej

05) = iA−2(σ0T0 − iπ0)

(24)

(25)

(26)

and if A = 3, Z = 1; T = −i so

C[1101] = (σ0 + π0)

which characterizes the ground state of 3H. Now interchange σ0 ↔ π0 in (26)
to get

C[(A−2)011] = iA−2(π0T0 − iσ0)

Then if A = 3, Z = 2; T = i we have

C[1011] = (σ0 − π0)

which characterizes the ground state of 3He. Equation (27) is the irreducible
spin representation Λ1 of (9) which occurs once only and (25) is an example
of a single term π0 arising from Ej
14 = Ei
05 (i = 1, . . . , A). Because T0 is a
scalar this term dictates the size of the subspace Λ1.

Then if A = 4, Z = 2, T0 = 0

C[1111] = σ2

0 + π2

0 + 8

which characterizes the ground state of 4He found to have only one spin
conﬁguration. In this case there is no mirror nucleus and A is even so there
is no decomposition like that of (7),(8). We are in fact in a vertical subspace

(36)

(37)

and once again we have precisely the decomposition given by Salamon (1989,
p33) of Λ5 = ΛΛ2+Λ3

.

Now if we assume, in accord with the canonical labelling suggested by (18),
that (λ2 + λ3) is the number of nucleons with negative spin σ and (λ2 + λ4)
that number with positive parity π then we can determine the eigenvalues of
C[λ] associated with each conﬁguration [λ] simply by substitution of

σ0 = {A − 2(λ2 + λ3)}i, π0 = {2(λ2 + λ4) − A}i

(38)

in (36),(37). These are eigenvalues without any interaction because as yet no
use has been made of (1),(6). However we can also substitute directly from
these equations (remembering from (20) that σ0 = 2σ1, π0 = 2π1) and use
the standard representations of so(3) for Γi to ﬁnd a matrix representation
µ of C ′
[λ]. The matrix representations of 13N and 13C are identical up to an
exchange of rows and columns and Table I (which does not show repeated
eigenvalues) compares the eigenvalues of C[λ] and C ′
[λ]. Because of the parity
change columns 1 and 4 will also yield the same eigenvalues, as will columns 2
and 3 up to a sign change caused by σ0 → −σ0. Those states associated with
the matrix representation C ′
[λ] in the last column are marked by an asterisk
and have repeated eigenvalues except when λ3 = λ4 = 3.

It is apparent that only the spin-parity states [2333], [4333] exhibit a tiny

10

mutation of 2/900. However if the eigenvalues of these states are interchanged
so that the ground state [4333] has the value -460 instead of -468, and [2533]
assumes 468 not 460 the mutations disappear. Thus these two states are
paired, diﬀering only in the number of neutrons with negative spin, so the
introduction of a Yang–Mills ﬁeld simply changes the spin of the two neutrons
in the paired states which amounts to a supersymmetric transformation.
Another example of paired states is given by Fig. 1 of de Wet (1995,96)
where X4 is the the ground state [3303] of 9Li and X5 could be the state
[3321].

Yang–Mills ﬁelds do not change the energy so there can be no dissipation due
to spin–mutations (this would lead to the collapse of nuclei to a zero–spin
state). Thus there must either be supersymmetry or the mutation is carried
by nucleons moving on two–dimensional toroidal surfaces in such a way as
to be anyons.

To ﬁnd the Kaehler metric on the fermion manifolds we need ﬁrst to ﬁnd
exp(C[λ]θ) which has been treated in some detail by de Wet (1994, 1995,
1996). Speciﬁcally

momentum λ0 and then dividing by λf = (λ1+λ0) which may be absorbed
in θ and does not change the geodesics although there is a frequency change
in the wave function eµθ. Examples of the translation are the last columns
of Table I.

The eﬀect of the translation is to multiply (42) by tan λ0θ which introduces

The metric (47) was used by de Wet (1996) to ﬁnd peaks or horns on the
manifold of 9Li which could represent instantons that become quarks or lep-
tons at energies suﬃciently high to break Yang–Mills symmetry; but for the
purposes of this contribution we simply observe that (47) is Einstein accord-
ing to the deﬁnition of Atiyah et. al. (1978) because only even products of
µ occur which means a diagonal representation like (34). In other words the
fermion metric is a solution of the source–free Einstein equations.

This also ensures that the Ricci tensor vanishes but the sectional curvature

does not because curvature is determined by the orientation of the remaining
p–planes. Thus a spinor ﬁeld corresponding to the state [λ]k and propagated
parallelly only around the section kk will return to its original value which
is precisely the condition found by Green et. al. (1993, chapter 15) to show
that a Calabi–Yau space or K 3 surface carries a string ﬁeld.

It is a pleasure to thank Peter Hall of the University of Port Elizabeth for
his help.

Introduction

Nearly three decades ago an explanation for the cosmological redshift diﬀerent from that usually
accepted was presented [1], [2].
It has not received much attention so far. Meanwhile, the
standard explanation for the redshift based on solutions of Einstein’s equations [3] applied to
the cosmos has been the generally accepted view on the subject. These solutions, derived by
Friedmann [4], [5] seem to suggest that the redshift is due to a universal cosmic expansion.
Direct evidence against this viewpoint, however, was provided by the dissident astronomer
Halton Arp [6], [7]. This evidence provided by Arp [6], [7] consists of observed close physical
association between various cosmic objects with vastly diﬀerent redshifts. The argument for
close physical association between the objects is nothing extra-ordinary either.
It is quite
simply the presence of visible ﬁlamentary bridges linking the objects. These objects pose a
basic challenge to standard cosmology.

No compelling evidence has been found for the link between curvature and gravity [3] despite
claims to the contrary. In support of this viewpoint I would like to draw the reader’s attention
to the following facts.

1) The three standard consequences of the link between curvature and gravity are usually
believed to be

a) observation of the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury, b) observed bending
of star-light passing close to the sun at a time of solar eclipse, c) apparent delay in transit time
of radio pulses reﬂected from planets when these pulses pass near the sun.

These three results are, however, derivable from a theory with ﬂat space in which the speed
of light and the rest mass at any point of space are functions of the Newtonian gravitational
potential at that point. The various physical quantities remain ﬁnite everywhere even when
the Newtonian potential blows up at the location of a point mass. This theory is therefore as
complete and simple as the standard theory claiming a link between gravitation and space time
curvature. Moreover this theory has the attractive feature that no inﬁnities in physical quanti-
ties occur at the location of point masses. Thus there are no black holes and all the paradoxes
associated with this enigmatic concept encountered elsewhere [8] [9] are now absent. I do not
regard this as a shortcoming of the theory since no direct evidence has so far been presented
for the occurrence of black holes. The evidence for black holes that has been presented [10]
involves (a) the assumption of a limiting value for stellar masses (the so called Chandrasekhar
limits for stars composed of various known kinds of matter) necessitated by the singular nature
of gravity in Newtonian and Einsteinian theories. (b) application to observations of binary
stars the Doppler shift formula derived under the assumption of local special relativity (LSR).
The latter assumption becomes untenable according to the viewpoint presented in a separate
communication [11]. The LSR Doppler shift formula is to be replaced by a diﬀerent formula de-
rived in [11]. Since the LSR formula has also been used in analyzing observations of the Taylor
Hulse pulsar [12] [13] the claim of precise agreement between the actual motion of the binary
star associated with the pulsar and the equations of general relativity becomes disputable. This
theory of gravitation in ﬂat space will presently be described in the following.

2) Because of the arguments presented in (1), it is natural to turn to cosmic scales for any
possible evidence of the above mentioned link between curvature and gravity embodied in
Einstein’s theory of gravity [3]. Again, the evidence against the connection is overwhelming.
Up to the farthest reaches of the universe available to our observing instruments, including

2

the Hubble telescope, the universe is absolutely ﬂat [14], [15], [16]. This has resulted in all
the eﬀorts, seeking to avoid large scale curvature, that have led to modiﬁcations of Einstein’s
equations with terms arising from ﬁelds producing so called inﬂationary eﬀects [17], [18], [19]
and the so called cosmological constant term [20]. None of these endeavors have received any
justiﬁcation in terms of what we know about fundamental forces besides gravity [21].

2 Postulates and their consequences

The ﬂat space theory of gravitation starts from the following postulates:

The Lagrangian (L) describing the motion of a body of rest mass (at inﬁnity) equal to m0
moving in the gravitational ﬁeld of another body with rest mass at inﬁnity M0 >> m0, which
is not acted upon by any force besides gravity, is mathematically analogous to that of a freely
moving body of mass m0 in special relativity . It is given by

L = −mc2

1 − v2/c2

p

where

c = c0 exp (−

aGM0
c2
0r

)

m = m0 exp (

bGM0
c2
0r

)

r is the distance between locations of the point objects whose rest masses at inﬁnite separation
are m0 and M0. c0 is the speed of light at an inﬁnite distance from M0. The presence of object
with rest mass at inﬁnity = m0 is assumed to make a negligible contribution to variations in c
in the following derivation. G is the Newtonian constant of gravitation = 6.67 ∗ 10−10N m2/kg2.

Introduce polar co-ordinates (r, θ) in the plane of motion with the polar axis (θ = 0) passing
through the origin at M0. The principle of stationary action [22] associated with the Lagrangian
(1) leads to the equations of motion and gives rise to the constant of motion H given by

From equation (9) it now follows that the perihelion advance per revolution is approximately

where A is the semi major axis of the orbit.

In order that for the planet Mercury, after allowing for perturbations by other planets, the
residual perihelion advance of 43” per century, corresponding to astronomical observations
(Leverrier), may become explicable by this ﬁrst order correction to the Newtonian theory one
must have

where ǫ is a small number. From equations (6 ), (12) it then follows that

Notice that with the values for a and b given by (13) and (12), eqns. (2), (3) imply that

Thus if m(r) c2(r) is interpreted as the total energy content of the test mass m(r) when it is
stationary at a location that is at distance r from M0 then this interpretation would lead to
the conclusion that when an active external agent is acting upon the test mass causing it to
move quasi-statically from r = ∞ to r = 0 the total energy gained by the agent from the test
mass is m0 c2
0. This is precisely the entire energy content of the test mass at ∞ according to
the theory of special relativity. Hence when the test mass eventually disappears in the manner
just described it does so without taking away any energy that becomes inaccessible because of
what is called an event horizon in the theory of general relativity [23].

According to Fermat’s principle of stationary time the path followed by light in going from A
to B must be such that the time taken is stationary under variations of the path. This leads
to the following diﬀerential equation for the path of a light ray.

Weber [24] has mentioned that the average for eleven eclipses is in agreement with (23 ) to
roughly 0.2 per cent. However I believe that this diﬀerence does not rule out the present theory
because the inﬂuence of the plasma (ionized matter) surrounding the sun on light propagation
near the sun must also be considered. The presence of a plasma whose density decreases with
increasing distance from the sun (as expected) causes the eﬀective refractive index to become
less than its value in the absence of the plasma. Since this eﬀect is frequency dependent it
could in principle be separated from the eﬀect due to gravity.

2.3 Time delay for pulsed radiation grazing the sun (Shapiro experi-

ment)

The time delay for an electromagnetic pulse passing near the boundary of the solar disk (solar
limb) can now be calculated. It is given by

time delay = 2(

This result (27) may be compared with the following expression (28) derived from the equations
of general relativity (G.R.) with the speciﬁc choice of co-ordinates giving the Schwarzschild form
of the space-time metric [25] and the assumption that the distances of planets from the sun are
given by the Schwarzschild radial co-ordinate despite its singular behavior near the sun. This
expression (28) forms the basis of Shapiro’s analysis [26] for time delay of radar echoes from
the planets.

time delayG.R. = 4G M0 (1 + ln(D1D2/p2))

(28)

If ǫ = 0 then the diﬀerence between (27) and (28) applied to the case of Mercury is close
to the uncertainty in the arrival time of the pulse. This uncertainty is due to the spreading
of the pulse. Because of this ”the experiment presents extraordinary diﬃculties in execution
and interpretation” [25]. Both the results (27) (with ǫ = 0) and (28) are in agreement with
observations at the present time.

Implications of the Pound-Rebka and the Hafele-Keating
experiments

I next turn to the physical meaning of the Pound-Rebka experiment [27] in the context of the
present viewpoint regarding variation of c and m with r given by equations (2) and (3). Let us
recall a simpliﬁed version of what is being observed in the Pound-Rebka experiment. In this
experiment recoil-less emission of gamma radiation by nuclei (Mossbauer [28]) is observed. The
emission occurs with negligible recoil of the nucleus because the nucleus is ﬁrmly embedded
in the surrounding crystalline lattice of atoms of which it is an integral part. This has the
consequence that the emitted gamma has a very narrow width with no Doppler broadening
expected of nuclei in, for example, a gas of molecules in thermal agitation.

7

Because of the sharpness of the gamma lines these lines may be used as a probe of very
small variations in their characteristics through various kinds of changes in the circumstances
under which these lines may be generated and/or detected. Thus the Pound-Rebka experiment
consists of investigating resonant absorption of these lines produced by a source when they pass
through an absorber (which is a much smaller version of the source itself) where the source and
absorber are arranged to be located at diﬀerent heights in the gravitational ﬁeld of the earth.
The observation made by Pound and Rebka may be described essentially as follows. In order
that the absorber may produce maximal absorption of the gammas it must be moving towards
(away) from the source with a speed proportional to its height (depth) above (below) the source
with the constant of proportionality equal to g/c where g is the acceleration due to gravity and
c is the speed of light, both measured on the surface of earth.

To analyze the entire situation very carefully, leaving no room for error, let us imagine two
identical stationary atoms one at ground level (location 1) at a distance R from the center of
earth and the other at location 2 which is at a height δR (<< R) above the ground level. Let
us denote the energy content of two atomic states a, b to be Ea1, Eb1 : (Eb1 > Ea1) respectively
for the stationary atom in location 1 and Ea2, Eb2 respectively for the similar atom in location
2. The frequency of the photon produced in the transition b → a occurring at location 1 is
ν1(b1; a1) so that the photon energy content at location 1 (E1(b1; a1)) is given by

E1(b1; a1) = h1 ν1(b1; a1) = Eb1 − Ea1

(29)

where h1 is the value of Planck’s constant at location 1.

The wave length (λ1(b1; a1)) of the electromagnetic wave associated with the photons produced
in the transition b → a at location 1 is then

λ1(b1; a1) = c1/ν1(b1; a1)

(30)

where c1 is the velocity of light at location 1 given by eqn(2). Analogous equations , obtained
via the substitution of 1 by 2 in (29, 30), hold for the photons produced in the transition b → a
at location 2. Actual experiments involve the transport of photons (or devices governed by
photons) from one location to another and comparison with the photons generated (or devices
governed by the local photons) at the other location. Let us therefore call the frequency and
wavelength of the photon 1 (generated in the transition b → a of an atom at location 1) after
its arrival at location 2 to be ν2(b1; a1) and λ2(b1; a1) respectively. After its arrival at location
2 its behavior is assumed to be indistinguishable from the locally generated photons. Therefore

where E2(b1; a1) is the energy of the photon (generated at location 1) after its arrival at location
2, c2 is the velocity of light and h2 is the Planck constant at location 2.

λ2(b1; a1) = c2/ν2(b1; a1)

E2(b1; a1) = h2ν2(b1; a1)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

Now it may be shown from the hypothesis of mass energy equivalence that when a stationary
atom at location 1 in state a or b is lifted quasi-statically against gravity to location 2, with no
kinetic energy imparted to it, the energy content is increased by the factor (1 + g δR/c2
0). Thus
we have

Ea2/Ea1 = Eb2/Eb1 = 1 + g δR/c2
0

Equations (2, 13 ) give

c2/c1 = 1 + (2 +

)g δR/c2
0

ǫ
2

Observation of spectral lines from the sun imply that their wavelengths (when compared with
those of similar lines generated by stationary atoms on earth ) are increased on arrival at earth.
The magnitude of this increase in wave length for lines in the solar spectrum observed from
earth suggests that if a similar experiment were performed on earth, i.e. the experiment in
which photons generated in the transition b → a at location 1 were allowed to propagate to
location 2 and then compared with the photons generated in the transition b → a at location
2, one would ﬁnd

Equations (31, 35) combined with the equation obtained from (30 ) through substitution of 1
by 2 then give

λ2(b1; a1)
λ2(b2; a2)

= 1 + g δR/c2
0

ν2(b1; a1)
ν2(b2; a2)

=

λ2(b2; a2)
λ2(b1; a1)

= 1 − g δR/c2
0

The Pound Rebka experiment [27], [29] has quite independently demonstrated that the photon
arriving from the lower level (location 1) to the upper level (location 2) needs to be boosted in
energy and frequency by the factor (1 + gδR/c2
0) in order that its energy may be changed from
Eb1 − Ea1 to Eb2 − Ea2 and it may be resonantly absorbed by atoms at location 2. Hence

ν2(b2; a2) = (1 + g δR/c2

0)ν2(b1; a1)

(37)

This relation (37 ) is thus seen to be in agreement with equation ( 36) suggested by terrestrial
observation of spectral lines from the sun as well as equation (33) derived from the mass energy
equivalence.

We shall now turn to the only other experiment that has a bearing on the issues being discussed
here. The problematic aspects of this experiment due to Hafele and Keating [30] will be

9

presented in the next section. In the Hafele Keating experiment [30] a cesium clock ﬂown in
a commercial airliner was compared with another at ground level. It was claimed that for the
airborne clock the number of its ticks had received a positive contribution due to its height
(δR). The amount of the claimed contribution indicates that

ν2(b2; a2)
ν1(b1; a1)

= 1 + g δR/c2

(38)

3.1 Critical remarks about the Hafele Keating experiment and their

consequences

The above analysis of Hafele Keating experiment ( 38 ) would have been unambiguously sound
if the following considerations were not involved . Hafele and Keating have also claimed in their
paper [30] the existence of a contribution to the proper time diﬀerence between the airborne
clock and another at ground level which is dependent on the velocity of the aircraft and which
vanishes as this velocity goes to zero. In other words, according to their analysis, the circum-
navigation with very slow velocities (quasi-static motion) does not produce any mis-match
between the two clocks at the end of the journey. This assertion is certainly in contradiction
with the form of the metric in a rotating system given by a succession of investigators such as
Einstein [3], Landau [31] and also with the somewhat diﬀerent form of the metric suggested
by Post[32]. According to these authors global synchronization of clocks on rotating frames
is impossible and in such frames circum-navigation of a clock moving quasi-statically along a
closed path is expected to produced a mis-match in time (δT ) with the stationary clock given
by

δT = ±

2 S ω
c2

(39)

where ω is the angular velocity of rotation and S is the area enclosed by the path of the circum-
navigating clock (or the path of counter-propagating light beams constrained by mirrors in the
Sagnac experiment [33] ). Notice that this mis-match between a circum-navigating and a
stationary clock depends on the velocity of rotation of earth and is absent from the Hafele
Keating [30] analysis. However what makes this result (39) important for us to retain is that it
also provides a simple understanding of the Sagnac eﬀect [33]. In the Sagnac experiment two
counter-propagating electromagnetic waves along a closed path deﬁned by a ﬁxed set of mirrors
in a rotating frame emerge with a phase diﬀerence. The Sagnac eﬀect has been observed both
in the case (a) when the source as well as observer looking at the fringes are in the rotating
frame [33] and also in the case (b) when the source and the observer are in a (near inertial)
frame with respect to which the set of mirrors deﬁning the closed path is rotating [34], [35], [36].
In case (b) the eﬀect is understood as arising from the diﬀerence in lengths of the two paths
traversed by light traveling with the same speed along them. In both cases the frequency of
the light moving along the two paths is assumed to be the same. In case (a) the lengths of the
paths are the same and the observed phase diﬀerence is due to the time diﬀerence at the end
of circum-navigation given by 2 δT (39). Eqn. (39) has been derived from the transformation
to rotating frames of the Lorentzian space-time metric [31] [3].

10

If this term (39) is really absent as Hafele and Keating seem to suggest from analysis of their
experiment then in the ﬁrst version of the Sagnac eﬀect experiment (which is the version directly
relevant to the Hafele Keating experiment) we would have to say that the phase diﬀerence is
due to a diﬀerence in the frequency of light along the two paths. Moreover we would also have
to accept that this diﬀerence in frequencies of light along the two paths is not manifested by an
analogous behavior involving clocks since Hafele and Keating do not seem to need it for their
analysis of their experiment [30]. So photons would not be analogous to clocks in their time
keeping behavior in rotating frames.

Another aspect of their analysis for the time diﬀerence that needs to be carefully addressed is
the following. They relate the proper times for the two clocks to a hypothetical clock located
in an imagined near-inertial frame at rest relative to the center of the earth. After ascertaining
the diﬀerence in proper times from that perspective they convert it back to the clock located
at ground level using local special relativistic formulas since the diﬀerence in proper times of
the two clocks is measured on the ground level clock in the actual experiment. So the natural
question to be asked is what happens to their calculation if the same local special relativistic
formulas are used but the proper times recorded by the two clocks are related to a hypothetical
clock located at the center of the earth in an imaginary near-inertial frame moving uniformly
relative to that in which the center of the earth is at rest. An analogous analysis then shows
that the result of the calculation is changed in the general case of an arbitrary inertial frame
in uniform motion with respect to the special frame chosen in the Hafele Keating analysis. So
if their analysis is to be accepted as correct, one must accept Hafele and Keating’s implicit
viewpoint that not all inertial frames are equivalent [30]

In view of the above remarks about their analysis it is plausible to suggest that perhaps the error
estimates quoted by Hafele and Keating are much smaller than the errors actually incurred.
If this is accepted as a correct statement then the Sagnac term (39) and the gravitational red
shift term together may completely account for their data.

However, we shall take the precautionary viewpoint that the Hafele Keating experiment is
inconclusive as suggested by

a) contradiction with the usually accepted explanation of the Sagnac eﬀect [33], [34], [35]- see
above. This eﬀect has been observed time and again by diﬀerent workers and is the basis of
technological devices for keeping track of ﬁxed directions in aircraft and Hitachi cars.

b) adopting a diﬀerent explanation for the Sagnac eﬀect (as described above) from the usually
accepted one would require us to accept time keeping behavior of clocks quite diﬀerent from
those of photons.

c) an explanation for the entire eﬀect in the Hafele Keating experiment [30] along the lines
suggested by Hafele and Keating [30] requires that inertial frames are not all equivalent.

d) no repetition of the experiment has been undertaken by these authors or any one else during
the past thirty years.

e) In the present framework of ideas, it is in disagreement with Einstein’s principle of equiva-
lence for light propagation in accelerated frames (to be explained below: see equation (44))

We shall therefore replace equation (38 ) by

11

ν2(b2; a2)
ν1(b1; a1)

= 1 + A g δR/c2
0

(40)

The constant A would then have to wait for its un-ambiguous determination in a future better
version of the Hafele Keating experiment or another experiment described below.

3.2 Proposed experiments

Now I propose that the total energy content of the photon generated at location 1 is the same
after its arrival at location 2. This is because, unlike the atom which has a non zero rest mass,
non-gravitational forces do not intervene to bring a photon to rest at one location from rest
at another location through the application of non-gravitational forces. A photon is never at
rest. So if non-gravitational forces have not made their appearance during the propulsion of
the photon under the inﬂuence of the conservative force of gravity then its energy content (hν)
must stay constant just as the total energy content of an atom moving under the inﬂuence of
gravity alone would stay constant. There is a viewpoint [37] in the literature contrary to this.
This viewpoint is based on the argument of making a distinction between the kinetic energy
and potential energy of the photon and identifying the former only with hν. The question of
the appearance and disappearance of the potential energy of the photon during its emission
from and absorption by the atom is thus completely ignored. Clearly then this viewpoint is
tantamount to the suggestion that the total eﬀective energy content of the photon does not
stay constant during its motion in the conservation ﬁeld of gravity. This argument would then
seem to suggest that the photon is not subject to the conservative nature of gravity unlike the
other particles. We propose to avoid this viewpoint and its conclusion.

Therefore for a photon generated at location 1 and arriving at location 2 equality of energy
content at the two locations implies

h1 ν1(b1; a1) = h2 ν2(b1; a1)

Equation (41) combined with the result of the Pound-Rebka experiment (37 ) and equation (40
) then implies

h1/h2 =

ν2(b1; a1)

i.e.

ν1(b1; a1) = (1 − (A − 1)g δR/c2

0) ν2(b1; a1)

Two comments are in order here.

(a) If the conclusion (38) of the Hafele Keating analysis [30] is sound in spite of the problematic
aspects of the other assumption in their paper (as explained above) then A = 1 and h1 = h2.

(b) If Einstein’s principle of equivalence, applied to light propagation in accelerated frames
holds then eqn. (43) implies that

(43)

A = 0.

and

h1 6= h2

(44)

Now according to Bohr’s quantum theory the atomic energy content is proportional to α2mc2
where α is the ﬁne structure constant and m is the mass of the electron.

Hence eqn. (33) gives,

= Ea1/Ea2 = 1 − g δR/c2

Equation (3) implies

m1/m2 = 1 + (3 + ǫ) g δR/c2
0

Equations (34), (45) and (46) lead to the conclusion

Equations (34), (42), (47) now imply that

α1 = α2

e2/e1 = 1 +

Thus one expects to ﬁnd an electric ﬁeld in the regions above and below two parallel metal
plates perpendicular to the direction of gravity and charged to a potential diﬀerence V2 − V1.
For the ideal case of inﬁnite plates the magnitude of this electric ﬁeld is calculated to be

|(3+ǫ/2−A)| g |V2−V1|
2 c2
0

The direction of the electric ﬁeld in the region above the plates is along (opposite to) the
direction of gravity according as (3 + ǫ/2 − A)(V2 − V1) is < 0 (> 0). In the region below the
plates the direction of the electric ﬁeld is opposite. Since according to our present approach
to physical theory the possibility of an apparently fundamental distinction between uniform
gravitational ﬁeld and a uniformly accelerated frame has been hinted at by the inconclusive
Hafele Keating experiment (equations 38, 40, 44) it is conceivable that this distinction might
become manifest in certain other experiments.

The principle of equivalence may now be directly tested by the following experiment. Take
two coaxial metal cylinders of radii R1 and R2 > R1. Charge these cylinders by applying a
potential diﬀerence V2 − V1 across the two cylinders. Spin the cylinders about the common axis

13

with the same constant angular velocity ω. Under the conditions of the experiment the charges
on the two cylinders are of opposite sign and their quantity per unit length (q) is expected from
application of equivalence principle to diﬀer by

δq = ( 3

4 + ǫ

8 ) qω2(R2

2 − R2

1)/(c2)

Hence electric ﬁeld E at a distance R(> R2) from the axis of symmetry is

E = (

(51)

In (50) and (51) we have assumed A = 0 in order that the Einstein equivalence principle for
light propagation in accelerated frames [3] may hold (44). Finally let us mention that in order
that charge may be attenuated by the force of gravity and the problems of plus inﬁnity and
minus inﬁnity associated with electric charges and gravitational masses respectively may both
be overcome we must have A − ǫ

2 < 3.

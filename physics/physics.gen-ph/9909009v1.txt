Fundamental Physical Constants
and the Principle of Parametric
Incompleteness

The principle which allows to construct new physical theories on the basis of classical me-
chanics by reduction of the number of its axiom without engaging new postulates is for-
mulated. The arising incompleteness of theory manifests itself in terms of theoretically
undeﬁnable fundamental physical constants ¯h and c. As an example we built up a paramet-
ric generalization of relativistic theory, where the Hubble Law and the dependence of light
velocity on time are obtained.

INTRODUCTION. QUESTIONS.

It is hard to overestimate the importance of fundamental constants ¯h and c in
contemporary physics. They deﬁne the structure of the theory’s basic formulas
so that these formulas can be transformed into corresponding relations of classical
physics by ﬁxing limit value of the constants ¯h = 1/c = 0. Their numerical value
set scale of the phenomena where respective corrections to the classical mechanics
become essential. They have become so common that sometimes are ”forgotten”
when working in the unity system with ¯h = c = 1.

Nevertheless there are many questions connected with fundamental constants

where full answers are not known yet. Some of them are listed below:

Why physical theory is uncapable of calculating constants without resorting to
the experiment?

Why fundamental constants emerge in more general physical theories such as
quantum and relativistic mechanics but are absent in classical physics?

Are fundamental constants, which diﬀer from ¯h and c, and relating to them
generalization of classical mechanics possible?

Is the set of possible fundamental constants ﬁnite?

Do physical ”constants” depend on time?

There is a great number of constants in physics thus ﬁrst of all it is necessary to

point out what we mean by using the term ”fundamental constants”.

For instance, speaking about the constant c one usually uses the term ”light
velocity”. At the same time two essentially diﬀerent constants are used under the
same name: the velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves in vacuum cem and
invariant velocity c deﬁning the structure of the relativistic theory. The fact that
the value of the electromagnetic waves velocity cem is equal to the value of invariant
velocity c is a property of one of the existing interactions while the constant c is
In particular, in order to measure the value of
build-in any form of substance.
invariant velocity there is no need to make electrodynamic experiments. It would
be enough to measure a speed of any particle in two frames of reference and get the
value from the formula of speed addition: u′ = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c2). Even if photon
had a diﬀerent from zero mass and there were no other massless particles the theory
of relativity with the constant c wouldn’t have changed.

Consequently, the constant c is a fundamental physical constant, and cem which
has the same numerical value is only a parameter of one of the interactions (related
to the value of the photon mass) and is not fundamental.

In general, present day’s physics consists of three closely related and intersecting

parts:

MECHANICS
INTERACTIONS (electroweak, strong,...)
STRUCTURE

(electron, muon, atom,...)

(classical,quantum,relativity...)

¯h,c,..
e, cem, ..
me, mp,..

MECHANICS sets laws that are applied to any structural unities and relations
between them. It is the basis of two other parts of the physics building. For instance,
requirement of relativistic invariance and unitarity restricts a class of possible in-
teractions. One and the same INTERACTION can be realized between diﬀerent
STRUCTURAL unities, the variety of which deﬁnes diversity of maniﬁstations of
our World.

Correspondingly, physical constants can also be divided into three classes (similar
classiﬁcation is given in [1]). Let’s hereafter assume to name fundamental only
those constants which deﬁne formulae structure of theories applicable to all the
forms of substance and kinds of interactions, i. e. those constants which deﬁne
properties of MECHANICS. In that way now we know three fundamental constants:
Plank’s constant ¯h, fundamental velocity c and, apparently, gravitation constant G.
Electron charge, masses of elementary particles and other important parameters are
not fundamental in the sense stated above.

In classical mechanics fundamental constants are absent. More exactly, their
). Gravitation constant G as well as light velocity are
value is trivially ﬁxed (0 or
present in classical physics but it obtains its fundamental sense only in contemporary
theories of space and time.

2 AXIOMATIC BASIS OF THEORIES.

By our opinion the resolution of the questions given in the introduction is connected
with the axiomatic analysis of the grounds of physical theories. In mathematics the
axiomatic method has been used since the Euclid times but serious attention has
been paid to the questions of axiomatic only after the appearance of non-Euclidian
geometry and paradoxes in the theory of manifold. The metamathematics with the
help of which an axiomatic structure of diﬀerent parts of mathematics is analised
was created by Gilbert and other mathematicians. Any axiomatic system of a theory
must possess the following features: independance, incontradictionity and complete-
ness [2].

In particular, completeness means that any statement of a theory must be proved
or denied with the help of initial axioms. So classical physics with respect to fun-
damental constants is complete while the theory of relativity is not because such
statements as c = 300, 000 km/sec can neither be proved or denied deductively (of
course, without making a corresponding experiment).

For more then two centuries there were attempts to prove the ﬁfth axiom of
Euclids parallel geometry. I. e. there was a suspicion that Euclidian axiom system
is not independant. Trying to prove the axiom about parallels there were derived
many theories which did not depend on that axioma - ”perfect geometry” according
to Boyai’s terminology. A new theory has been created - non-Euclidian geometry.
Unlike Euclidian geometry this theory possesses a new constant R-radius of space
curvature, the value of which cannot be deﬁned from initial axioms and with 1/R
0 these formulas transfer into respective theorems of Euclidian geometry.

→

If in the theory there is a constant which value is impossible to derive from initial
axioms we shall call it parametric incompleteness of the theory. Why does
it occur? Obviously because a new, shortened system of axiom contains less infor-
mation then initial one. A decrease of information results in some incompleteness
of the theory’s conclusions. This incompleteness can be minimal, i. e. all the func-
tional relations of a theory can be obtained from initial axioms and only ﬁnal set of
constants will remain undeﬁneable.

Following Einstein, there is rather common but axiomatically incorrect way to
build up relativistic theory basing on two postulates: the principle of relativity and
the principle of constancy of light velocity. It looks like that to build up the theory
of relativity it is necessary to add a new axiom of ”cem-invariance ” to the classical
Galilei theory of relativity. It is rather wrong. Lorentz transformations and all the
theory of relativity formulas derived from axioms of classical mechanics in which
absoluteness of time is denied. And the statement c = inv is a theorem of a theory
but is not its initial statement.

The fact that Lorentz transformations can be obtained from simple group consid-
erations without using the second Einstein postulate was known in 1910 yet owing
to the works of Ignatowsky, Frank and Rothe ([3],[4] for references). In spite of the
fact that this simple and beautiful result has been reprinted in literature several
times for the last ninety years it has not become a possession of text-books though.
Some latest works of this line can be found in [4] -[10], references for earlier sources
in [4].

As it is known there is a deﬁnite analogy between geometry and the theory of

3

relativity. Let’s consider a velocity space, i. e. a three-dimensional space,where each
point represents one or another inertial system. The vector between two points of
this space corresponds to the vector of relative velocity of two systems. The principle
of relativity or inertial system equality according to the language of geometry means
that the velocity’s space is gomogeneous and isotropic, i. e. there are no privileged
points (frames of reference) and directions within this space.

If we suppose that the velocity space has a Riemannan structure, we would see
that there are only three possibilities follow from the principle of relativity: a plane
space, a space of negative and positive constant curvature. The ﬁrst one corresponds
to Galilean rule of summing up velocities and to classical mechanics, the second one
corresponds to the theory of relativity, the third one, probably, can’t be realized in
nature though it is formally used in Euclidian theory of ﬁeld.

The velocity space with constant negative curvature is a Lobachevsky space. The
curvature of this space corresponds to the value of fundamental velocity c. In this
way, the theory of relativity and classical mechanics are already contained in the
principle of relativity and Lorentz transformations can be obtained without using
a postulate c = inv.
In this regard as well as in Euclidian geometry there is a
fundamental constant c associated with a decreased number of initial axioms (or
information they contain). A giving of the axiom of time absolutivity up makes the
theory of relativity a parametrically incomplete.

3 PARAMETRICAL INCOMPLETENESS
AS A PRINCIPLE OF ACCORDANCE.

In August, 1900 David Guilbert formulated his famous 23 problems on the II Inter-
national congress of mathematicians. The sixth problem was a purpose of physics
axiomatisation. Almost immediately after that two new mechanics had been con-
structed: quantum and relativistic. The crucial features of these theories are two
fundamental constants ¯h and c.

Within any mechanics one might build up his own axiomatic systems from which
all the relations of the theory can be derived. But it is not a satisfactory solution of
Guilbert’s sixth problem. The existance of several systems of axioms breaks integral
structure of physics. Besides, this does not allow to obtain new physical theories by
axiomatic means.

After axiomatic deﬁnitions of basic concepts (Space, Time, Mass, State) classi-
cal mechanics becomes rather formal mathematical theory, the axiomatic system of
which must satisfy the conditions of completeness, independence and incontradic-
tivity.

Any decrease of information contained in axiomatic scheme of classical mechanics
leads to undeﬁneable (unconcludeable) parametres, functions, etc. There exist such
minimal information simpliﬁcations of mechanics axioms when only ﬁnal number of
constants becomes undeﬁneable and all the functional relations are derived straight-
forwardly. Thus, on the basis of classical mechanics it is, probably, possible to form
a set of parametrically incomplete theories deductively. In these theories a part of
fundamental physical constants will be played by constants which origin is related

4

to a decrease of the initial information containing in axioms of classical mechanics.
At the limit values of these constants we will obtain a classical theory again.

In this way we have, so to say, a converse principle of correspondence. One may
obtain classical mechanics not from the quantum theory or the theory of relativity
but obtain new fundamental theories from classical physics.

Using the language of algebra, it is necessary to look for all the possible stable
deformations of algebraic structures of classical physics. Parameters of deformations
inevitably emerging in this connection will be fundamental constants of the new
physics. We already know three of such deformations. The construction of other
physical theories possessing a corresponding parametric incompleteness looks is more
than interesting prospect.

It may happen that despite all the variety (probably inﬁnite) of objects and
their interactions in our World there exists a ﬁnite number of fundamental physical
theories (mechanics) which are parametrically incomplete and can be derived from
axioms of classical mechanics.

4 PROJECTIVE THEORY OF RELATIVITY.

As an example of an application of Parametrical Incompleteness Principle let’s con-
sider some axioms of classical physics related to the principle of relativity. We are
interested in a manifest relations between coordinates x and time t of two observers
in diﬀerent inertial frames S and S′:

x′ = f (x, t),

t′ = g(x, t)

(1)

In classical mechanics we requires the following to be realized ﬁrst of all:

Axiom I. Transformations of coordinates and time are continuous,

diﬀerentiable and one-valued functions.

This requirement is very natural, and though it narrows the class of possible func-
tions of transformation it nevertheless leaves this class rather wide. Each additional
axiom reduces arbitrariness of choice of transformations (1) unless this arbitrariness
appears parametric or disappear completely (in classical mechanics)

Axiom II. If some body moves uniformly in the system S it’s move-

ment in the system S′ will also be uniform.

The axiom (II) is actually a deﬁnition of inertial systems and time. ”The time is
deﬁned so that moving to be simple.” [11].

Despite rather common character of Axiom (I), (II), the functional dependence

of transformation can be ﬁxed completely.

x′ =

Ax + Bt + C
ax + bt + c

,

t′ =

Dx + Et + F
ax + bt + c

,

(2)

leaving nine parameters A, B, C, D, E, F, a, b, c (see Appendix1)

We should notice that linear-fractional transformations with the same denomi-
nator are well known as projective transformations in Geometry. These are more

5

common transformations when all the straight lines transfer into straight lines [12].
That is an essence of the Axiom (II) in a two-dimensional space (x, t)

Axiom III. At the moment of time t = t′ = O origins of systems

coincide: x = x′ = 0

Axiom IV. All the points within the frame of each observer are ﬁxed.

Axiom V. If the point of the system S′: x′ = 0 moves at a speed of v
v
−

relatively S the point of the system S: x = O moves at a speed of v′ =
relatively S′

x′ =

The Axiom (III) physically means the possibility of local, simultanuos experiment
for both observers which would allow to ﬁx origin of coordinates in space and time.
As far as the point x′ = O is stationery in the system according to (IV), it can
be derived from the axiom (II) that it moves uniformly and linearly at some speed
v relatively S: x = x0 + vt. In this regard (III) the following can be derived: x0 = 0
Analogically the beginning of the system S relatively S′ moves at a speed of
v′ :
v′t′. In this connection the axiom (V) is introduced. Comparing to
previous axioms the ﬁfth axiom is not that ”obvious”. Moreover, this axiom cannot
be realized in absolute (ether) theories where relativistic principle [14] - [16] is vio-
lated. We should also point out that it can be considered as a theorem which derives
from linearity of transformations (1), isotropy of space and principle of relativity [4].
Let’s consider that (V) is an independent axiom allowing the observers in S and S′
to coordinate unit of measurement of time(or length) by mutual agreement about
the equality of relative speed measured by them.

Taking into consideration Axioms (I)-(V) we can write the following coordinate

transformations (1) :

is valid only in case if γ(v), b(v) are even functions and σ(v), a(v) -is odd.

The seventh axiom is the key in axiomatic of the relativistic theory It expresses

the principle of relativity and equality of inertial systems.

Axiom VII.There exist at least three equal inertial systems moving

with arbitrary speeds.

If X means the vector (x, t), and X ′ = Λ(X, v) the matrix notation of transfor-
mation (3), for all frames S1, S2 and S3 we have: X2 = Λ(X1, v1), X3 = Λ(X2, v2) =
Λ(X1, v3), so:

Λ(Λ(X1, v1), v2) = Λ(X1, v3),

X1, v1, v2

(4)

∀

This functional equation gives the following relations between coeﬃcients of trans-
formation (3):

γ3 = γ1γ2(1 + σ1v2)
γ3 = γ1γ2(1 + v1σ2) (

v3γ3 = γ1γ2(v1 + v2)
σ3γ3 = γ1γ2(σ1 + σ2) (

(

a3 = a1 + a2γ1 + b2γ1σ1
b3 = b1 + b2γ1 + a2γ1v1,

(5)

where γ3 = γ(v3) etc. The ﬁrst system of equations in (5) allows us to ﬁnd a function
σ(v):

σ(v1)
v1

=

σ(v2)
v2

= α = const

As far as speeds v1 and v2 are arbitrary independent values, α is some constant
which is fundamental and the same for all the inertial systems.
In our World it
equals inverse square of ”light velocity”: α = 1/c2. It is impossible to ﬁx numerical
value of this constant without additional axioms. So we have a manifestation of
the principle of parametrical incompleteness and appearance of parametrically in-
complete generalization of classical mechanics which is known as special theory of
relativity.

The requirement of equality of inertial systems together with the axiom (V) leads

where λ - is a new fundamental constant which is the same for all the inertial
systems. Until now we used only one space dimension. Let’s change the axiom (III)
for:

Axiom III’. At the moment of time t = t′ = 0 of the planes (y, z),
(y′, z′), which satisfy the equations x = 0, x′ = 0,are parallel. Axles y, y′
and z, z′ are mutually parallel as well.

It is easy to obtain formulae for coordinates which are transverse to moving. So we
ﬁnally have:

These transformations fully correspond to seven axioms formulated above. The only
arbitrary quantities are two constants α and λ. As far as these constants are the
same for all the inertial reference systems we can call them fundamental.

7

Obviuosly classical mechanics also follows the axioms (I)-(VII) but it eliminates

parametrical incompleteness by introducing two additional statements:

Axiom VIII. If the speeds of two particles are equal in one frame of

reference they will be equal in another one.

Axiom IX. If two events are simultaneous in one frame of reference

they will be simultaneous in another one.

The Axiom (VIII) leads to condition λ = 0, and (IX) - to α = 0. The Axioms (I)-
(IX) are independent and fully deﬁne transformation (1). With their help Galilei
equations are derived:

(11)

Classical mechanics which contains Axioms (I)-(IX), is parametrically complete the-
ory. There are no undeﬁnable physical constants. We may say that the system
(I)-(IX) is informationally complete. If we exclude axiom (IX) in the independent
system of axioms (I)-(IX) the quantity of information will be decreased and we shall
inevitably obtain some incompleteness of the theory. But this incompleteness is lim-
ited only by indeﬁneable constant ”c”, i.e.
it leads to a parametrically incomplete
theory. In this respect the axiom (IX) maintains minimum amount of information.
The Axiom (VIII) (which omition would lead to generalization of the theory of rel-
ativity and new parametrically incomplete mechanics with some new fundamental
constant) possesses the same property. We should note that the omition of the sec-
ond proposal of the axiom (III’) would lead to another parametrically incomplete
generalization of classical mechanics. If λ and α are non-zero we obtain a theory
which generalizes the relativistic theory. It is convenient to call it as Projective
Theory of Relativity. Obviously, there are possible four limited situations which
can be realizad with diﬀerent scales of observed phenomena. So with λ = 0 we
obtain ordinary Lorentz transformations and with α
0 - projective generalization
of Galilei transformations:

(12)

As far as λc has a dimension of inverse length any corrections of Lorentz trans-
formations can be detected only long later after initial synchronisating experiment
(Axiom III) or at long distances from origin of coordinates.

It seems natural that the decrease of the number of axioms demands a serious
reconsideration of our intuitive concept of space and time. First time this happened
when a special theory of relativity appeared. We may suppose that relativity of
notions can be extended at a further building of parametrically incomplete theories.

where ~v = (v, 0, 0), ~r = (x, y, z). Despite the fact that relatively to observer in S′ all
the points of his system are ﬁxed (i. e. they have the same zero speed) S′ points have
diﬀerent speed from the point of view of the reference system S. Moreover, they
move away in radial directions relative to the point displaced at ~vγ/b from the origin
of coordinates. The system S′ seems as though it expands from the point of view
of stationary observer. In this way, relative notion is not only a simultaneousness of
events but also a relative motionlessness of objects from the point of view of diﬀerent
observers.

2.We should note that the dependance of formulae (13) on time t doesn’t mean
If particle in the system S moves uniformly and
non-uniformity of free moving.
lineary x = x0 + uxt, a moving in the system S′ will be uniform and linear (the
system of axioms maintains it). But the speeds u′
y depend not only on the
speeds ux, uy, but also on the location of particles at some ﬁxed moment of time.
For example, we have for u′

This property as well as relativity of mutual motionlessness is connected with the
fact that a projective transformation does not retain parallelism of straight lines.

3.It is easiy to see that if the signal spreads in the system S′ at a speed of c,
this speed will not be equal to c in the system S′.Moreover, it is dependant on
coordinates ~r, t. But we can examine that the following value

~C(~r, t) =

~c + λc2~r
1 + λc2t

is an invariant velocity. So for a one-dimension case this value transfers as a velocity
(13):

where the same function(17) stands in the left and right part of the ﬁrmula. If we
take derivative u′
x on ux and equate it with zero we ﬁnd that limit can be achieved
x with any ux v = c equals C(x′, t′). In this way the value
at v = c. The value u′
deﬁned in (17), can be considered as generalization of light velocity in the theory of
relativity.

We should point out that the speed of light is C(r, t) but not c. The constant c

is fundamental physical constant and equal C(r, t) only if r = 0, t = 0.

For an observer S in x = 0, light velocity C(0, t) reduces after some time (with
λ > 0).We should notice that not so long ago there appeared works in which the
idea of dependance of light velocity on time was used for solution of cosmological
paradoxes [17]- [22].

We point out again that dependance of light velocity on time and coordinates
does not mean non-uniform moving of light signal. Any light signal emitted from
some point of space at time (t0, ~r0), moves with a constant speed C( ~r0, t0) along
trajectory ~r = ~r0 + ~C( ~r0, t0)(t
t0). In particular, light impulse which passed the
origin of coordinates at the moment of synchronising experiment (Axiom III) moves
along the trajectory x = ct at a constant speed C(ct, t) = c. The dependence of
light velocity on time and condition of its constancy along uniform motion trajectory
leads to the functional equation:

−

which must be true at any x0, t0, t. The simplest solution of equation is (17).

C (x0 + C(x0, t0)(t

t0), t) = C(x0, t0),

6 TRANSFORMATIONS BETWEEN OBSERVERS

OF ONE INERTIAL FRAME

In all the formulae of the projective theory of relativity the point x = 0, t = 0 is
privileged. Actually, linear-fractional transformations are not considered because of
their non-homogeneity and consequently non-homogeneity of experiments in space
and time. We should notice that priveleged point x = 0, t = 0, is obviously
associated with an initial synchronising experiment. It is also isolated in space-time
in the theory of relativity but it does not result in its non-homogeneity.

Another complication is connected with seeming non-equivalence of observers
inside one of the reference system. Let’s consider two rest observers which are
situated at points x = 0 x = R. A light signal emitted by the ﬁrst observer at a
speed of C(0, 0) = c is received by the second observer in t = R/c time. But he
is unable to reﬂect it with the same speed because in this case it would be back in
t = 2R/c and would have a speed which would be more than a light velocity at that
moment c > C(0, 2R/c).

To solve those problems one must consider transformations between two mo-

which would be in accordance with formulae of the projective theory of relativity.

Let’s go back to axiomatic method again. As far as we describe transformations
between two rest observers ( ~X, T ) and (~x, t) in one inertial system, we require ax-
ioms (I) and (II) to be fulﬁlled. Besides, transformation X = X(x) must not be
dependant on time (motionlessness of observers) and must be deﬁned by one com-
mon parameter-relative distance R which must be chosen the same on agreement

It is easy to see that (22) formally coincides with the formula of addition of

With σ > 0 this is a Lobachevsky space in Beltrami coordinates of tangent space.

For accordance with the projective theory of relativity we require the light velocity
C(x, t) to be invariant for all the observers inside the inertial system. Thus we shall
write transformations for speed U = dX/dT, u = dx/dt

U =

and suppose U = C(X, T ), u = C(x, t). We obtain a conclusion that invariance is
observed if µ = λ σ = (λc)2 > 0.

−

In this way we have the following physical situation: homogeneous and isotropic
coordinate space inside inertial reference system is a Lobachevsky space of con-
stant negative curvature. At the same time physical vector of direction is a vector
tangent to space. Physical length R is connected with geometric s by equation
R = λc tanh(s). Physical time is deﬁned in such a way that free particles move uni-
formly and lineary for all the rest observers. We should notice that from the formula
(23) it can be automatically derived that synchronising procedure looks in the fol-
lowing way: Two observers which are at a relative distance R from each other, for the
(λcR)2)/(λc)2R),
point lying at an equal distance from them x =
are ﬁxing equal time T = t. In case of moving frame of reference it is necessary to
use formulae of the projective theory of relativity.

7 HUBBLE’S LAW. EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE.

An interesting conclusion from the formulae of previous sections arises if Doupler’s
eﬀect is analized within one inertial system.

Let’s consider remote motionless source of light with coordinates ~R emitting
light in the direction to observer which is situated at the beginning of coordinates
x = 0. The light pulse emitted at the moment of time t1 according to observer’s
clock reaches it at the moment t2. As far as the speed of this signal is constant
c ~R/R),
C(R, t1) = C(0, t2) and it moves in the direction towards the observer (~c =
we have the following relations between R, t1, t2:

−

t1)c = R + λc2Rt2.

(t2

−

Let’s suppose light pulses are emitted with some period τ0 = ∆T1 and are received
with a period τ = ∆t2. As far as the source’s time T and the observer’s time t are
related according to (23), then at constant ~x = ~R, ∆T equals ∆t/
(λcR)2. Thus
(λcR)2, and having entered cosmological
the period of emission is τ0 = ∆t1/

~V = λc2 ~R

Interpreting the redshift according to Doupler’s formula we obtain Hubble’s law:

As we saw above the privelegness of the point x = 0, t = 0 is connected with
the initial synchronising experiment for concording the units of length and time by
diﬀerent observers. Nevertheless, space is homogeneious and isotropic and therefore
all the observers should be equivalent.

But homogeneity in time is not quite usual. First of all it’s usualness is associated
with the dependence of local light velocity (or maximum possible physical velocity)
on time:

C(0, t) =

c
1 + λc2t

.

1/(λc2). The fact that
In the past light velocity turned into inﬁnity with t0 =
the ”beginning of Time” t0 is away from time t = 0, by the value proportional to
fundamental constants, is also associated with the procedure of deﬁning units of
measurement.

−

You may ﬁnd the explanation of it in such example. Suppose, that some observer
at the moment of time t = 0 had deﬁned the unit of length (ruler), the unit of time
(sec) and measured light velocity and received the result c = 300000 km/sec. In
some period of time T his distant descendants found the unit of length but they do
not know the unit of time. But it is known from ”ancient manuscripts” that light
passes 300000 km per second. Descendants deﬁne respectively their clocks and light
velocity measured by them from this moment equals:

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

C(0, T ) =

c
1 + λc2T

12

There is used the same numerical value of fundamental constant c in the formulae
(29),(30). But time t and time T , are evidently diﬀerent. It is easy to ﬁnd valation
between of times T = T (t). As far as dx = C(T )dT = C(t)dt, and T (τ ) = 0, we
obtain by integrating the formula:

T =

t

τ

−
1 + λc2τ

,

(31)

(32)

generalizing the notion of replacement of time. For descenders as well as for their
ancestors ”the beginning of Time” is distant for the same value (λc2)−1, measured
in diﬀerent units of time.

Now let’s discuss applicability of theory consrtucted herein to the Real World.
As far as Hubble’s eﬀect is naturally described within the projective theory of rel-
ativity it would be natural to associate Hubble’s constant H = 65 km/sec/Mps =
6.7 10−11 year−1 with the constant λc2. In this case the change of light velocity in
time would be the following:

∆C
C

= λc2t =

6.7 10−11

−

t
year

.

In this way we have the following cosmological model. We live in stationary
space of constant negative curvature (λc)−1 = const. The evolution of our World is
connected not with the expansion of Universe but with the variability of speed of
light C(r, t) with time and distance. This leads to the observed redshift for radiation
of distant objects.

There is also another and not so radical possibility of interpretation of Hubble’s
extension. If λc2
H, our theory gives only small corrections to Hubble’s law, when
traditional extension contributes more within the limits of the theory of Big Bang.
In this case the dependence of light velocity on time C(x, t) can be considerable only
within little times from the beginning of Big Bang.

8 CONCLUSION. QUESTIONS.

So taking proposed relativistic theory as an example, we shown that there is a pos-
sibility to obtain new physical theories generalizing classical mechanics by reducing
its axiomatic base. If the system of axioms is independent we ﬁnd incompleteness
of the theory which can be minimal in some cases and can cause the emerging of
fundamental physical constants and respective theories. Thus all the generalizations
of classical mechanics are parametrically incomplete theories, and fundamental con-
stants are manifestations of this incompleteness.

Quantum theory with Plank’s constant is also a parametrically incomplete the-
ory. The elements of its axiomatic building can be found at Dirac. It is shown in [23]
that Plank’s constant emerges from natural classical requirement if to exclude the
axiom of physical values commutation. We should notice that one of the axiomatic
directions of quantum mechanics - a quantum logic, also arises from the idea of de-
crease of number of axioms. In this case we consider the system of axioms of Boolean
logic, where the axiom of distributive [24] is omitted. The resulted nondistributive
lattice happens to be isomorphic for some quantum-mechanical systems.

13

Deductive, preexperimental path of building new theories looks very attractive.

In this regard the following questions arise:

How to formalize the concept of information contained in physical axiom?

Is there an eﬃcient procedure of search of axioms, which being omitted cause
minimal informational lose-parametrical incompleteness?

Are parametrical generalizations of quantum mechanics possible?

Is the amount of information contained in the system of axioms of classical
mechanics, and, therefore, a number of its possible generalizations and funda-
mental constants, limited?

Is the Nature limited by parametrical incompleteness?

•

•

•

•

•

Of course, the list of these questions can be continued. Anyway, the investiga-
tion of axiomatic of physics is not only academically interesting for it extenses our
understanding of Nature, but also it can lead us to constructive results allowing
experimental testing.

APPENDIX 1.

Let’s consider arbitrary, independant, diﬀerentiating transformations of the co-

ordinate x and time t:

(33)
We require the system of coordinates (x, t) and (x′t′) to satisfy the deﬁnition of
inertial reference systems:

x′ = f (x, t),

t′ = g(x, t).

du
dt

= 0 =

du′
dt′ = 0,

⇒
i.e. if a moving of a body is uniform in one system, it would be uniform in another
one.

According to deﬁnition the speeds in each system are u = dx/dt and u′ = dx′/dt′,

thus:

u′ =

fxu + ft
gxu + gt

,

where fx = ∂f (x, t)/∂x, etc. Diﬀerentiating (35) on dt′ = (gxu + gt)dt and equating
coeﬃcients of speed u (taking into consideration its arbitrariness) to be zero, we
obtain the system of diﬀerential equations:

fxxgx = gxxfx
ftt gt = gtt ft
fxxgt + 2fxtgx = gxxft + 2gxtfx
fttgx + 2fxtgt = gttfx + 2gxtft.

Let’s introduce Jacobian of transformations diﬀerent from zero (33) D = fxgt

(41)

where A(x), B(t), ¯A(x), ¯B(t) - are arbitrary functions. We should notice that two
last equations in (41) are direct results of (36),(37).

Let’s multiple the equation (38) by ft, and (39) by

fx and add. Then with the

help of (36), (37) we obtain diﬀerential equation only for the function f (x, t):
t + fttf 2

x = 2fxtfxft.

−

Taking fxx and ftt from the ﬁrst equation (41) and putting it in (42), we obtain:

A′(x) =

˙B(t) = α.

−
As far as t and x are independent arguments, α is an arbitrary constant. The
equations(36)-(39) are symmetric under replacement of f for g, thus we have similar
equations for ¯A(x) and ¯B(t). Thus:

A(x) = αx + β;
¯A(x) = ¯αx + ¯β;

B(t) =
¯B(t) =

(αt + γ);
( ¯αt + ¯γ),

−
−

where α, β, γ, ¯α, ¯β, ¯γ - are constants which do not depend on x and t.

Integrating the third and fourth equations (41), we have:

or

g(x, t) =

f (x, t) + M(x) =

f (x, t) + N(t)

¯A(x)
A(x)

f (x, t) = (M(x)

N(t))/

−

¯B(t)
B(t) −

¯A(x)
A(x) !

,

 

where M(x), N(t) - are arbitrary functions. Putting (46) in the ﬁrst equation (41),
we have:

(αx + β)M ′(x) + αM(x) = (αt + γ) ˙N(t) + αN(t) = σ,
where σ - is arbitrary constant. The equations (47) are easily integrated and give
for M(x) and N(t):

(47)

M(x) =

σx + λ
αx + β

;

N(t) =

σt + µ
αx + γ

,

which along with (41) ﬁnally lead us to lineary-fractional transformations with the
same denominator.

From the second equation of the system (7) and ﬁrst two systems (5) we have:

We can also make sure that metric (53) remains forminvariant respective transfor-
mations inside one reference system. In this way we have six-parametrical group of
transformations (~v, ~R).

Metric (53)can be written in the following way:

Abstract

We will provide detailed arguments showing that the set of Maxwell
equations, and the corresponding wave equations, do not properly de-
scribe the evolution of electromagnetic wave-fronts. We propose a non-
linear corrected version that is proven to be far more appropriate for
the modellization of electromagnetic phenomena. The suitability of
this approach will soon be evident to the reader, through a sequence
of astonishing congruences, making the model as elegant as Maxwell’s,
but with increased chances of development. Actually, the new set of
equations will allow us to explain many open questions, and ﬁnd links
between electromagnetism and other theories that have been searched
for a long time, or not even imagined.

1 Short introduction

The theory of electromagnetism, in the form conceived by J.C. Maxwell, can
boast 130 years of honored service. It survived the severest tests, proving
itself to be, for completeness and elegance, among the most solid theories.
Very few would doubt its validity, to the extent that they may be more
inclined to modify the point of view of other theories, rather than question
the Maxwell equations. The trust in the model has been strong enough to
obscure a certain number of “minor” incongruities and to incite the search
for justiﬁcations in the development of other theories.

1

Nevertheless, even if the time-honored equations excellently solve com-
plex problems, they are not able to simulate the simplest things. They are
not capable for instance of describing what a solitary signal-packet is, one of
the most elementary electromagnetic phenomena. Alternative models have
been proposed with the aim of including solitons, but they did not succeed in
gaining a long-lasting relevance, because they were based on deliberate ad-
justments, that, accommodating speciﬁc aspects on one hand, were causing
the model to lose general properties on the other.

The development of modern ﬁeld theory, which was very prosperous in
the years 1930-1960, has magniﬁed the role of the equations, giving them a
universal validation in the relativistic framework. This progress came to a
stop, leaving however the impression of being not too far from the goal of
compenetrating electromagnetism and gravitation theory.

We are going to make some statements that many readers will certainly
consider heretic. We think that the various anomalies, which are present in
the model, are not incidental, but consequences of a still insuﬃcient theoret-
ical description of electromagnetic phenomena. Actually, it is our opinion
that the ﬂaws are more severe than expected, and therefore, such a fun-
damental “brick” of Physics needs extensive revision. The review process
must be so deep that the entire setting necessitates re-planning from the
beginning. On the other hand, if it were just a matter of small adaptations,
this revision would have already been made a long time ago.

We shall start to analyse some substantial facts, that at a practical level
may be considered marginal, with the aim to evidentiate contradictions. We
solve these problems by suitably redesigning the Maxwell equations. This
will allow for the construction of a new model, solving all the inconsisten-
cies and achieving the scope of a better understanding of electromagnetic
phenomena. In a very natural way, the new approach also leaves the door
more than open, to those links and generalizations that were expected to
come from the Maxwell equations, but which, although vaguely insinuated,
could never be realized in practice.

None of the gracefulness that characterizes the Maxwell model will be
lost. The reader who has the patience to follow our arguments through to
the end, will discover that all the pieces ﬁnd their exact place in a global
scheme, with due elegance and harmony. We do not wish to say more in this
short introduction. The model will be developed step by step, up to its ﬁnal
form, in order to let the reader appreciate the phases of its maturation. The
mathematical tools used are classical, and maybe dated. On the other hand,
our intention is to examine what would have happened to the evolution of

2

Physics, if our model was taken into consideration, in place of the Maxwell
equations. We will elaborate and clarify many important concepts, leaving
the path well clear for future developments, not considered here due to lack
of time.

2 Criticism of the theory of electromagnetism

In this section, we make some ﬁne considerations regarding the evolution
of electromagnetic waves, and the way they are modelled by the Maxwell
equations. We start by pointing out deﬁciencies mainly at the level of math-
ematical elegance. These will reveal other more severe incoherences. In the
end, even taking into account the correctness, up to a certain degree of
approximation, of the physical approach, our judgement will be rather neg-
ative. As a matter of fact, in section 3, with the aim of ﬁnding a remedy to
the problems that have emerged, substantial revision will be proposed.

From now on, until section 11, we assume that we are in void three-
dimensional space. As usual, the constant c indicates the speed of light. In
this case, the classical Maxwell equations are:

∂E
∂t

∂B
∂t

= c2curlB

divE = 0

=

curlE

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

−
divB = 0
(2.4)
where the vector ﬁeld E is dimensionally equivalent to an acceleration mul-
tiplied by a mass and divided by an electrical charge; while B is a frequency
multiplied by a mass and divided by a charge.

The above equations are supposed to be satisﬁed point-wise at any in-
stant of time. Their solutions are assumed to be smooth enough to allow
diﬀerential calculus. Therefore, discontinuous or singular solutions are not
allowed. The equations (2.2) and (2.4) could be considered unnecessary,
since they are easily deduced from (2.1) and (2.3) respectively, after apply-
ing the divergence operator. Later on, for the reasons that we are going to
explain, we will question the validity of (2.2) and (2.4). As a consequence,
the entire formulation will lose its credibility.

3

As far as the evolution of an electromagnetic plane wave (with inﬁnite
extent and linearly polarized) is concerned, we have no objections to make.
In Cartesian coordinates, a monocromatic wave of this type, moving along
the direction of the z-axis, is written as:

E = (c sin ω(t

z/c), 0, 0)

B = (0, sin ω(t

z/c), 0)

(2.5)

−

−

In this case, the Maxwell equations are all satisﬁed point-wise.

The next step is to examine the case of a spherical wave, which is far
more delicate. The wave could be generated by an oscillating dipole of
negligible size. However, the way the wave is produced and supplied is not
of interest to us at the moment, being more concerned with analyzing the
geometrical aspects of its evolution at a distance from the source.

×

Let us denote by P = E

B the Poynting vector. It is customary to
assume that E and B are orthogonal, and that the wave-front propagates
at constant speed c, through spherical concentric surfaces. One may argue
that perfect spherical waves do not exist in nature. Nevertheless, for the
sake of simplicity, we maintain this hypothesis which can be removed later,
without modifying the essence of our reasoning.

We are basically confronted with two possibilities. In the ﬁrst one, the
Poynting vector follows exactly the radial direction. This means that E
and B locally belong to the tangent plane to the wave-front.
In such a
circumstance, as detailed below, we are able to show that (2.1) and (2.3)
cannot be both satisﬁed everywhere. More precisely, it is known that (2.1)
and (2.3) are true up to an error that decays quadratically with the distance
from the source. Since the intensity of a spherical electromagnetic wave
only decays linearly in amplitude, the above mentioned inaccuracy has no
inﬂuence on practical applications. However, we record a ﬁrst negative mark.
The second possibility is that, in order to satisfy all the set of Maxwell
equations, we loose the orthogonality of the Poynting vector with respect to
the wave-front surface. This is a more unpleasant situation, considering that
the Poynting vector represents the direction of propagation of the energy
ﬂow. The lack of orthogonality between the wave-front tangent plane and
the direction of propagation violates the Huygens principle (recall that we
are in vacuum), leading to a deformation of the front itself. As we will check
later, this results in relevant defects in the development of the wave-shape.
Let us study the problem more in detail, by taking into account the

transformation in spherical coordinates:

(x, y, z) = (r sin φ cos θ, r sin φ sin θ, r cos φ)

(2.6)

with 0

having the following form:

θ < 2π, 0

π and r large enough. We look for vector ﬁelds

B = (0, 0, u)

E = (v, w, 0)

(2.7)

where u, v, w are functions of the variables t, r and φ (no dependency on
θ is assumed).
In (2.7), the ﬁrst component of the vectors is referred to
the variable r, the second one to φ, and the third one to θ. The unknowns
in the system of Maxwell equations reduce from six to three. Choosing a
more general form for the ﬁelds only complicates the computations, without
adding anything to the substance.

We start by observing that equation (2.4) is immediately satisﬁed. More-

over:

To avoid discontinuities, we must introduce the following boundary con-

In the case of the pure radiation ﬁeld of an oscillating dipole, when r is
suﬃciently large, one usually sets v = 0 and w = cu. Within this hypothesis,

∂v

the two equations (2.11) and (2.13) are equivalent. They bring us to the
general solution:

w(t, r, φ) = c u(t, r, φ) =

(2.16)

where f (with f (0) = f (π) = 0) and g are arbitrary functions (the only
restrictions apply to their regularity). Among these solutions there is the
one corresponding to f (φ) = sin φ, which is often present in classical texts
(see for instance [2], p.284), being the one with more physical relevance.
Nevertheless, we unfortunately note that equation (2.12) is compatible with
v = 0 only when:

sin φ

Note that such a strong singularity at the poles cannot be removed only by
requiring the wave-front not to be perfectly spherical.

We observe that f can be taken in such a way that divE is vanishing at
the poles (for example f (φ) = (sin φ)2), but not in the proximity of them.
In addition, we observe that, if f is regular with f (0) = f (π) = 0, for any
ﬁxed r, the points in which the divergence of E does not vanish belong to
a bidimensional set whose measure is diﬀerent from zero. For instance, if
f (φ) = sin φ, we ﬁnd out that divE is proportional to cos φ, so that this
set consists of all points of the sphere of radius r, with the exception of
the equator. It is certainly true that even if the divergence is not zero, it
is negligible when designing, for instance, a device like an antenna. This
argument, however, is not going to be valid here, since we would like to
carry out an in depth analysis of what is really happening in the evolution
of an electromagnetic wave, compared to what the Maxwell theory is able
to predict.

Let us now follow a diﬀerent path and try to ﬁnd other solutions, of the
form given in (2.7), satisfying the set of all Maxwell equations (including
divE = 0). If we do not want f to be singular somewhere, we have to accept
that v is diﬀerent from zero. This means that E has a radial component,

6

so that the Poynting vector cannot be perfectly radial. We have to better
check what happens in this last case.
It is well-known that the the Maxwell equations lead to:

1
c2

∂2E
∂t2 = ∆E

and

1
c2

∂2B
∂t2 = ∆B

(2.20)

The above are usually called “wave equations”, but, shortly, we will see that
this name is not appropriate. The terminology is correct only if the ﬁelds
involved are scalar. By deriving (2.11) with respect to time and using (2.12)
and (2.13), we arrive at the equation:

1
c2 utt =

1
r2 (r2ur)r +

1
r2

1
sin φ

(cid:18)

(u sin φ)φ

(cid:19)φ

(2.21)

corresponding to the third component of the second equation in (2.20) in
spherical coordinates.

It is worthwhile noting that (2.21) is not the wave equation for the scalar
ﬁeld u in spherical coordinates, due to the fact that in this framework the
Laplacian of a vector ﬁeld is not the Laplacian of its coordinates (even if
only one of them is diﬀerent from zero). The wave equation for u reads as
follows:

1
c2 utt =

1
r2 (r2ur)r +

1
r2 sin φ

(uφ sin φ)φ = ∆u

(2.22)

This is not a trivial warning, since many texts in electromagnetism erro-
neously confuse (2.22) with (2.21). Implicitly, we made the same mistake
before, when looking for d’Alembert type solutions of the form (2.16), gen-
erating, for this reason, solutions not compatible with all the Maxwell equa-
tions.

By separation of variables, for any k

1 and any n

1, we discover

that (2.21) admits the following basis of solutions:

are Bessel functions of ﬁrst and second kind respec-

A classical reference for Bessel functions is [11]. It is important to note
that the solutions given in [11] at page 127, for the scalar wave equation in
spherical coordinates, diﬀer from the ones shown in (2.23). The reason is
that the functions in [11] (having Pn(cos φ) in place of sin φ P ′
n(cos φ)) are
those solving (2.22), which is not the vector version of the wave equation,
as we already mentioned.

For example, if n = 1 we have (see [11], p.54):

(2.24)

In order to understand what the solutions in (2.24) look like, it is standard
to introduce some approximation. Thus, for n = 1 and r large, by taking
the combination r−1/2(sin(ckt)J3/2(kr) + cos(ckt)Y3/2(kr)) sin φ, up to mul-
tiplicative constants, it is possible to get asymptotically the monocromatic
solution u = r−1 sin φ sin k(ct
r) (compare to (2.16)), up to an error which
decays quadratically with r. Once again, one ends up with something simi-
lar to a travelling wave, although some cheating has been necessary (that is
equivalent, in the end, to replacing once again (2.22) by (2.21)).

−

On the other hand, suppose that u is evaluated exactly as linear com-
bination of the functions in (2.23). Then, one recovers v e w by (2.12) and
(2.13), through time integration. Successively, it is possible to compute the
Poynting vector:

which has, as expected, a non radial component. Now, let us ﬁx r and study
the behavior, by varying φ, of the two components of P. In particular, we
are interested to see what happens near the poles (φ = 0 or φ = π). We start
n(cos φ) tends towards a ﬁnite limit

to check that the second component in (2.25) behaves as sin φ near the poles.

We are ready to draw some preliminary conclusions. Let us note that
ﬁnally divE = 0, hence all the Maxwell equations are satisﬁed. As already
remarked, it has been necessary to keep the nonradial component of P.
Surprisingly, for any ﬁxed r, such a nonradial component prevails on the
radial one, when approaching the poles. This implies that the shape of
the wave-fronts does not resemble a sphere, but rather a kind of doughnut
with the central hole reduced to a single point. The parts of the fronts
corresponding to the internal side of the doughnut, progressively stratify
along the z-axis. We do not see a chance of recognising any sort of Hyugens
principle here. This is not what we would call a travelling wave. It may
be argued that this behavior is due to the inﬂuence of the source located
at r = 0. But, if we stop the source, the wave-fronts already produced
continue to develop. If their motion is ruled by the Huygens principle, the
hole should ﬁll up quickly, and each front should transform to something
rounded which is almost a perfect sphere. The problem is that, during this
smoothing process, the vector ﬁelds E and B are not compatible with both
the constraints divE = 0 and divB = 0. The clue is that “wave equations”
in vector form have nothing to do with real waves.

Some mild analogy between the Maxwell equations and the eikonal equa-
tion, governing the movement of the fronts, was devised a long time ago. The
equivalence is valid within the limits of geometrical optics (see [5], p.110).
In spite of this, examining the behavior of the fronts, our impression is that
their natural evolution is in conﬂict with all restrictions imposed by Maxwell
equations. This statement will be clearer as we proceed with our study. The
right connections with the eikonal equation will be deﬁned in section 10.

The diﬀerent situations analyzed up to now are summarized in ﬁgure 1,
which should clarify our point of view: either we keep the singularity at the
poles (manifested by inﬁnite amplitude of the ﬁelds or strong geometrical
distorsion), or we allow the divergence of the electric ﬁeld to be diﬀerent
from zero. To sustain this proposition, let us collect other elements.

Some confusion usually arises when one tries to simulate the evolution of
a “fragment” of wave. We examine the case of the plane wave given in (2.5).
For any ﬁxed z, we can cut out a region Ω in the plane determined by the
variables x and y, and follow its evolution in time. For simplicity, Ω can be
the square [0, 1]
[0, 1]. Inside Ω we assume that the electromagnetic ﬁelds
evolve following (2.5), in full agreement with Maxwell equations. Outside Ω,
the ﬁelds E and B are supposed to vanish. The question is understanding
what happens at the boundary ∂Ω of Ω. It is not diﬃcult to realize that,

Some readers may complain because discontinuities of the ﬁelds may
not exist in nature. Commonly, the right way to proceed is to consider a
thin layer around ∂Ω, where the solution given by (2.5) smoothly decays
to zero. Then, one lets the width of the layer tend towards zero. This in
general allows us to determine special relations to be satisﬁed on ∂Ω (in place
of the Maxwell equations, which are meaningless there). Unfortunately, the
procedure presents some drawbacks. Let us ﬁrst assume that the wave-fronts
shift along the z-axis maintaining their squared shape. We also assume
that the ﬁelds E and B are orthogonal and smoothly decaying to zero in a
neighbourhood of ∂Ω (like for instance in ﬁgure 2). Our conjecture is that

10

6
= 0 or divB

there exists at least one point where Maxwell equations are not all satisﬁed,
because divE and divB cannot both be zero at the same time. Actually,
examining ﬁgure 2, we discover that there are inﬁnite points where either
divE
= 0. These points form a set whose area is diﬀerent from
zero. We are free to try other conﬁgurations by modifying the orientation
of the vector ﬁelds at each point near ∂Ω, but we always arrive at the same
conclusion: some rule of Physics breaks down when approaching ∂Ω. Now,
the question is: if we do not know what the governing rules are in the layer
around ∂Ω, how can we go to the limit for the size of the layer tending to
zero?

Another possibility is that the wave-fronts, due to the strong variation
of the ﬁelds near the boundary of Ω, are forced to bend a little. The electro-
magnetic ﬁelds are no longer on a plane, so we could probably ﬁnd out the
way to enforce all the Maxwell equations. However, this implies that the
Poynting vectors are not parallel to the z-axis anymore. Thus, the shape of
Ω is going to be further modiﬁed during the evolution. A little diﬀusion is
bearable, yet our impression is that the wave-fronts would rapidly change
their form. The more they bend, the faster they produce other distorsion.
This is in contrast for instance with the fact that neat electromagnetic sig-
nals, of arbitrary transversal shape, reach our instruments after travelling
for years between galaxies. The only acceptable rule is that all the Poynting
vectors must stay orthogonal to the fronts and parallel to the actual direc-
tion of movement; if this does not happen the wave quickly deteriorates,
fading completely.

To prove what we claimed before, we show using very standard argu-
ments that it is not possible to construct solutions to Maxwell equations,
having ﬁnite energy and travelling unperturbed at constant speed along a
straight-line. We assume that the speed is c and the straight-line is the
z-axis. Without loss of generality, such a signal-packet is supposed to be of
the following type:

E =

(2.1) and (2.3) only hold when E and B are identically zero. Actually, it
is straightforward to discover that E3 e B3 must be constant (and the sole

Figure 2: Example of electromagnetic ﬁeld smoothly reducing to zero at the bound-

The Maxwell equations are satisﬁed in the central part. Instead, approaching the
boundary, the divergence of the ﬁelds turns out to be diﬀerent from zero.

constant allowed is zero). Then, one ﬁnds out that E1, E2, B1, B2 must be
harmonic functions in Ω. Since they have to vanish at the boundary, they
must vanish everywhere.

Due to the above mentioned reasons, solitonic solutions are not described
by the classical theory of electromagnetism. Eﬀorts have been made in
the past to generalize the Maxwell model, in a nonlinear way, in order to
include solitons. Just to mention an example, the Born-Infeld theory (see
[4]) predicts the existence of ﬁnite-energy soliton-like solutions (that have
been successively called BIons). These last equations have no relation with
the ones we are going to develop in this paper. However, they point out the
necessity of looking for nonlinear versions of the model. We will come back

12

to the subject of solitary waves in section 5.

In many applications, a standard approach is to reconstruct the bidi-
mensional proﬁle of the ﬁelds inside Ω with the help of a truncated Fourier
series. This is accomplished by a complete orthogonal set of plane waves,
each one carrying a suitable eigenfunction in the variables x and y. We
must pay attention, however, to the fact that these eigenfuntions are of the
periodic type. Therefore, they reproduce the same proﬁle, not only inside Ω,
but in a lattice of inﬁnite contiguous domains. In this way, the represented
solution turns out to have inﬁnite energy. Considering only one of these
proﬁles, thus forcing to zero the solution outside Ω, unavoidably brings us
again to a violation of the Maxwell equations near the boundary of Ω. Some
clarifying comments on this issue can be found in [8], p.42.

We recognize that the techniques based on Fourier expansions provide
excellent results in many practical circumstances, as for example the study
of diﬀraction. Nevertheless, in this last case and in the ones treated before,
it is necessary to adapt the solutions, introducing some approximation, if we
want them to correspond to the real phenomenon. Indeed, these adjustments
are within the so-called limits of the model. Hence, we could just stop our
analysis here, with the trivial (well-known) conclusion that the Maxwell
model is not perfect. We believe instead that the discrepancies pointed out
are not just imperfections, but symptoms of a more profound pathology
aﬀecting the theory of classical electromagnetism.

What we learn in these pages is that there are plenty of simple and
interesting phenomenon, which are inadequately explained by the Maxwell
model, because the equations impose too many restrictions. Consequently,
the idea we shall follow in the next section is of weakening the equations,
with the aim of widening the range of solutions.

As the reader may notice, the “awkward” relation divE = 0 has been
eliminated. It is also evident that in all the points in which divE = 0, we
ﬁnd again the classical Maxwell system. This states that the solutions of
(2.1)-(2.2)-(2.3)-(2.4) are also solutions of (3.1)-(3.2)-(3.3). Therefore, the
replacement of (2.1)-(2.2) by (3.1) brings us to the property we wanted, that
is the enlargement of the range of solutions.

Afterwards, we have to understand and justify what is happening from
the point of view of Physics. Let us recall that we are in empty space,
and that there are no electrical charges or masses anywhere. We are only
examining the behavior of waves. In spite of that, we pretend that there
may be regions where divE
= 0. The situation is not alarming, since we
checked that the condition divE
= 0 is quite frequent in the study of waves.
Anyway, such a hypothesis is acceptable, as long as it is coherent with the
basic laws of Physics. First of all, we observe that the equation (3.1) has
been obtained by adding a nonlinear term to (2.1). The term has strong
analogy with the corresponding one of classical electromagnetism, appearing
on the right-hand side of (2.1) as a consequence of the Amp`ere law, and due
to the presence of moving charges. In fact, by setting ρ = divE, the vector
ρcJ can be assimilated, up to dimensional constants, to an electric current
density. Thus, even if in our case there are no real charged particles, we have
to deal with a continuous time-varying medium, consisting of inﬁnitesimal
electrical charges, living with the electromagnetic wave during its evolution.
Moreover, the added term does not compromise the theoretical study of a
functioning device like an antenna, since, at a certain distance, the quantity
divE is negligible.
By taking the divergence of (3.1), we get a very important relation:

−
which is, actually, the continuity equation for the density ρ = divE. The
equation (3.4) testiﬁes to the presence of a transport, at the speed of light,

along the direction determined by J. Hence, something is ﬂowing together
with the electromagnetic ﬁelds; something that later, in sections 9 and 10,
will be compared to a true mechanical ﬂuid. On the other hand, this was
also the interpretation at the end of the 19th century, before the theory of
ﬁelds was rigorously developed. The ﬂuid changes in density, but preserves
its quantity, as stated by the continuity equation.

icant to remark that this property comes directly from (3.1), so it is not

construct a mass tensor that, due to (3.1), can be perfectly combined with
the standard electromagnetic energy tensor. The skilful reader has already
understood that this will allow us to ﬁnd the link between electromagnetic
and gravitational ﬁelds.

a source of a lot of trouble.

In the classical Maxwell equations the role of the ﬁeld E can be inter-
changed with that of ﬁeld cB. This is not true for the new formulation.
We will later see, in section 9, how to solve this problem. For the moment,
we keep working with (3.1)-(3.2)-(3.3), just because the theory will be more
easy. In the coming sections 4 and 5, we will see how elegantly it is possible
to solve the problems raised in section 2.

4 Perfect spherical waves

In the case of a plane wave of inﬁnite extension, for both the Maxwell model
and the new one, we are able to enforce the condition divE = 0 and realize
the orthogonality of the Poynting vectors with respect to the propagation
fronts. Concerning a “fragment” of plane wave, the classical method runs
into problems. However, with the new approach the situation radically
improves. Let us see why.

into equation (3.1), they come to a diﬀerence of the type +
singular terms reciprocally cancel out, leaving a ﬁnite quantity, so that the
equation has a chance to be satisﬁed. To show this, we can create a layer
around the boundary of Ω. Then, without developing singularities, we pass
to the limit for the width of the layer tending to zero. The trick now works,
because, in contrast to the classical Maxwell case, equation (3.1) can be
satisﬁed exactly in all the points, since it is compatible with the condition
divE
In the limit process we can also guarantee that the Poynting
vectors remain parallel to the z-axis. Therefore, the fragment does not
change its transversal shape. Explict computations will be carried out in
section 5, in the case in which Ω is a circle.

we still have problems (clearly equation (3.2) and (3.3) are not true). Similar

The case of a spherical wave is very interesting. Let us consider the

ﬁelds are given as in (2.7), with u, v, w not depending on θ. We have:

Once again, the ﬁrst and the last equations are equivalent, providing the
general solution (2.16). Anyway, this time, thanks to the nonlinear corrective
term of (3.1), the second equation is compatible with v = 0. We are not
obliged to choose f (φ) = 1/ sin φ, in order to enforce the condition divE = 0,
because this constraint is no longer required. The conclusion is that perfect
spherical waves are admissible with the new model. The functions f e g
may be truly arbitrary (the only restriction is f (0) = f (π) = 0). Continuing
with our analysis, we will construct later inﬁnite other solutions which are
unobtainable with the classical Maxwell model.

In the perfect spherical case, the Poynting vector P = (cu2, 0, 0) only
has the radial component diﬀerent from zero. As expected, this component
has a constant sign (even if u and w oscillate). Since the set of equations
is of a hyperbolic type, we can introduce the characteristic curves. In the
example of the spherical wave, such curves are semi straight-lines emanating
P
from the point r = 0, and the vector J = P/
= (1, 0, 0) is aligned with
|
|
them. The nonlinear term introduced in (3.1) does not adversely aﬀect the
behavior of the wave, because, with v = 0 and w = cu, the corresponding
equations (4.7) and (4.9) are linear. Therefore, the superposition principle is
still valid. Any piece of information, present at the boundary of the sphere
of radius r > 0, propagates radially at the speed of light, without being
disturbed (except by the natural decay in intensity). The nonlinear eﬀects
of the model are latent. They show up when we try to force, with some
external solicitations, the Poynting vector not to follow the characteristic
lines. This circumstance will be taken into account in sections 7 and 8.

In a very mild form, we can state that the divergence vanishes, by ob-

serving that, for any T :

T +2π/ω

divE dt = 0

T
Z

(4.10)

that is divE has zero average when integrated over a period of time. Never-
theless, in section 13, we will get an astonishing result. We will see that an
electromagnetic wave produces, during its passage, a modiﬁcation of space-
time.
In the new geometry, the 4-divergence of the electric ﬁeld is zero.
This could make it diﬃcult, or even impossible, to set up an experiment
that emphasizes the condition divE
= 0 at some point. The measure could
be aﬀected by the modiﬁed space-time geometry in such a way the condition
cannot be revealed.
Among the stationary solutions we ﬁnd:

u(t, r, φ) =

−

K1

with K1, K2, K3 arbitrary constants. In particular, we recognize the classical
stationary electric ﬁeld:

E = (K2r

−2, 0, 0)

whose divergence is zero for any r > 0. Unfortunately, most of these solu-
tions show singularities.

Due to the nonlinearity of the equations, the study of the interference of
waves looks quite complicated. As long as the waves are such that divB =
0 and divE = 0 (as in the plane case) there are no problems, since the
nonlinear terms do not actually activate. For waves of diﬀerent shape, the
situation may be truly intricate. In ﬁrst approximation, the nonlinear eﬀects
should attenuate faster than the amplitude of the waves. Thus, at a certain
distance, these anomalies may not normally be observed. Although we do
not wish to discuss it here, the subject is of crucial relevance and deserves
to be studied in more detail.

5 Travelling signal-packets

In this section, it is convenient for us to express our new set of equations
in cylindrical coordinates. After taking (x, y, z) = (r cos θ, r cos θ, z), we
assume that the ﬁelds are of the form B = (0, 0, u), E = (v, w, 0), where the
ﬁrst component is referred to the variable r, the second one to the variable
z and the third one to the variable θ. Moreover, for simplicity, the functions
u, v and w will not depend on θ. In cylindrical coordinates, the counterparts
of equations (4.3)-(4.4)-(4.5) are:

Note that the divergence of E is equal to ρ = vr + r−1v, so that it is
diﬀerent from zero, unless f is proportional to 1/r. The functions f and g
can be arbitrary (to guarantee the continuity of the vector ﬁelds, we only
impose f (0) = 0). The relations in (5.5) give raise to electromagnetic waves
shifting at the speed of light along the z-axis. If f and g vanish outside a
ﬁnite measure interval, for any ﬁxed time t the wave is constrained inside a
bounded cylinder. The packet travels unperturbed for an indeﬁnite amount
of time. The corresponding ﬁeld E is perfecly radial and the vector J is
parallel to the z-axis.

Given r0 > 0, suppose that f is zero for r > r0. Suppose also that f ,
in a neighborhood of r0 has a sharp gradient. It is evident that the vector
cg′f, 0, 0) remains bounded even if

Suppose that, at an initial time t0, the electromagnetic ﬁelds are as-
signed compatibly with (5.5). The vector J turns out to be automatically
determined, then the wave is forced to move in the direction of J at speed
c. There are no stationary solutions, unless g is constant. But, in this last
case, due to (5.8), the energy is not going to be ﬁnite. The wave-packets
take their energy far away, with no dissipation, until they react with other
waves or more complicated structures (like, for instance, particles).

≥

Let us study more closely the expressions given in (5.5). Assume that,
for r
0, the function f is non negative, and that f (0) = 0. If the function g
has a constant sign, we distinguish between two cases, depending if the sign
is positive or negative (see ﬁgure 3). The sign determines the “orientation”
of the vector curlB (note however that curlB is not exactly parallel to the z-
axis, despite what is shown in ﬁgure 3). Then, we have subcases, depending
whether E is directed toward the z-axis or not. In conclusion, two possible
types of solitary waves can occur, depending on the orientation of the electric
ﬁeld (external or internal). These will be denoted by γ+ and γ−, respectively.
In ﬁgure 3, J indicates the direction of motion. Of course, g could also have
a non-constant sign. In this case, the corresponding wave can be seen as a
sequence of waves of type γ+ and γ−, shifting one after the other.

In vacuum, the electromagnetic ﬁelds at rest, are assumed to be identi-
cally zero. During the passage of a soliton, the calm is momentarily broken
only at the points “touched” by the wave. The information shifts, but does
not irradiate. Thus, also if the wave-packet displays a negative or positive
sign, depending on the orientation of E, this is not in relation to what is
usually called electric charge. Hence, as long as the cylinders containing two
diﬀerent solitons do not collide, they can cross very near without inﬂuencing
each other. On the contrary, we expect some scattering phenomena, through
a mechanism that will be studied in section 8.

If we place a mirror parallel to the z-axis, at some distance from it,
the reﬂected image of the travelling wave-packet will be the same wave-
packet shifting in the opposite direction (because curlB changes sign, while

universe. An answer to these crucial questions will be given in section 8.

Actually, they include the previous ones (take f1 = f and f2 = 0). In section
9, we will remove the condition divB = 0, allowing for the existence of even
more solutions. We can force f1 and f2 to vanish outside a bidimensional
domain Ω. Again, this plane front, modulated by the function g, travels
along the z-axis at the speed of light.

We may reasonably expect that these solitary solutions are modiﬁed, or
even destroyed, when they encounter another external electromagnetic ﬁeld.
In fact, the equations being nonlinear, the superposition principle does not
hold, in particular if the motion is disturbed in a way that is in contrast to
the natural evolution along the characteristic curves. As far as we know,
there are no documented experiments evidencing these facts.
In section
11, we instead examine the behavior of solitary waves under the action of
gravitational ﬁelds.

An electromagnetic radiation can be suitably considered as an envelope
of solitary waves, travelling in the same direction. If, transversally, these
solitons are of inﬁnitesimal size, they can be compared to “light rays”. This
observation clariﬁes how a wave can be viewed at the same time as a whole
electromagnetic phenomenon and as a bundle of inﬁnite microscopic rays.

And then there are photons. They are also pure electromagnetic manifes-
tations, but, unfortunately, they are not modelled by the Maxwell equations.
Modern atomic and subatomic physics would not exist without photons, yet
they ﬁnd no place in the classical theory of electromagnetism. This is an
unpleasant gap. Although physicists are acquainted with this dualism, the
general framework remains blurred. From our new standpoint, we contend
that the photons observed in nature have very good chances to be modelled
by the equations introduced here. As a matter of fact, we have enough free-
dom to be able to build solutions (no matter how complicated) resembling
real photons. We can assign a frequency to them, longitudinally or transver-
sally. Then, we know that they must move at the speed of light and can

23

have ﬁnite energy, given by the energy of their electromagnetic vector ﬁelds.
They can be “positive” or “negative” without being electrical charges. Even
with no mass at rest, their motion can be distorted by gravitational ﬁelds
(see section 11). A concept of spin can be also introduced (see section 15).
If what we are proposing here is a new functioning model for electromag-
netism (and we will collect other evidence supporting this hypothesis), then
it explains why photons can be self-contained elementary entities and elec-
tromagnetic emissions at the same time. In this case, a ﬁrst link between
classical and quantum physics is set forth.

6 Lagrangian formulation

In order to recover the equations (3.1)-(3.2)-(3.3) from the principle of least
action, we follow the same path bringing to the classical Maxwell equations.
Thus, we introduce the scalar potential Φ and the vector potential A =
(A1, A2, A3), such that:

B =

From the above deﬁnitions we easily get the equations: divB = 0 and
curlE. The third equation (3.1) is going to be deduced from the

minimization of a suitable action function.

relation (6.8) says for instance that, if the vector variation (δA1, δA2, δA3)
locally belongs to the tangent plane generated by E and B, then the vari-
ation δA0 is zero. Although for the moment we can only provide vague
explanations, we assert that (6.8) is the germ of the Huygens principle. The
picture will become more focused as we proceed with our analysis.

Consequently, we discover that the 4-vector

where the parameter λ is a Lagrange multiplier. By eliminating λ we easily
arrive at equation (3.1). Thanks to (6.8), the set of possible variations is
smaller than the set in which we impose no restrictions at all. Therefore, the
equation δS = 0 is now less stringent. As we already know, this shows that
(3.1) admits a space of solutions which is larger than the one corresponding
to (2.1) and (2.2) together.

In section 11, within the framework of general relativity, we will be able to
write (6.11) in invariant tensor form.

Let us try to understand the reason for the constraint (6.8). As far as
the evolution of a plane or a spherical wave is concerned (and, surely, in
more general cases), it is easy to check that:

A = ΦJ

(6.12)

A straightforward way to get (6.12) is from explicit solutions. For example,
in spherical coordinates, we can use (2.16) in order to ﬁnd:

In conclusion, the equation (3.1) can be recovered from the constrained
minimization of the action function associated with the classical Lagrangian.
The constraint originates from (6.12) which says, in particular, that A is
lined up with J. As will be better explained in section 10, such a condition
characterizes the propagation of waves, whose evolution is ruled by the Huy-
gens principle. From now on, these will be called “free waves”. In sections
7 and 8, we will see that not all waves are of this type.

An interesting relation, that is directly obtained by checking (6.13) or

(6.14), is the following one:

analogous of the Lorentz law for moving electric charges (recall that cJ is a
velocity), even if here there are no particles around. As it will be explained
in the coming sections, equation (6.18) tells us that the mechanical forces
acting on a free wave are zero. Therefore, the wave actually moves without
external disturbances and in agreement with the Huygens principle. We will
prove all these statements in sections 9 and 10.

they have quite a general validity.

7 Encounter of a wave with an obstacle

In this section and in the following one, we study what happens to a free
wave when it meets an obstacle that we deﬁne of “mechanical type”. The
phenomenon can be extremely complicated, therefore the analysis will be
carried out on very simple cases. For the moment, here we just discuss some
basic facts, trying to catch the underlying ideas. In section 9, we formalize
the problem better, by writing down the ﬁnal equations.

We ﬁrst take into account an example concerning the reﬂection of an
electromagnetic radiation. We assume to have a monocromatic plane wave,
linearly polarized, which is totally reﬂected by a perfectly-conducting metal-
lic wall. Hence, we suppose that there is no refraction at all. In Cartesian
coordinates, the wall corresponds to the plane y = 0. Initially, the wave-
front propagates forming an angle ζ
= 0 with the y-axis. Referring to ﬁgure
4, the incident wave is described by the ﬁelds:

E(i) =

The reﬂected electric ﬁeld E(r) is such that, for y = 0, the component
parallel to the obstacle, of the vector E(r) + E(i), vanishes (see for instance

(7.2)

To justify the imposition of the boundary conditions on y = 0, it is cus-
tomary to assume the existence of instantaneous electric currents on the
conducting surface, which force the tangential electric ﬁeld to zero (see [5],
p.558, and [9], p.335).

After reﬂection, the wave is very similar to the incident one, with the
exception that J(i) = (0, cos ζ, sin ζ) has changed in J(r) = (0,
cos ζ, sin ζ).
Note that the relation (6.18) is valid both for the incident and the reﬂected
waves. Nevertheless, during the impact, in which an instantaneous ﬂip of
the signs occurs, the wave-front at y = 0 does not show a behavior con-
sistent with the one corresponding to a free wave. Each wave-front, when
reaching the wall, evolves for a single moment without respecting the eikonal
equation. Of course, what we are considering here is just a mathematical
idealization. More realistically, the wall is made of matter, so it would be

more correct to check what happens to the wave when it interacts with the
atoms of the wall. Anyway, we do not think it is useful to study this more
complicated situation, since it only modiﬁes the form but not the substance
of facts. We believe that the main idea has already been outlined: when
encountering an obstacle a free wave may lose its likeness and become, for
a small amount of time, a “constrained wave”. The reaction of the obstacle
can be so strong that, as in the case of the reﬂecting wall, the wave-fronts
are forced to modify abruptly the direction of their movement. What we
would like to do in the following pages, is to understand what happens at
those instants.

We recall that, for y = 0, the vector E(r) + E(i) does not have the same
length of E(i) before the impact (or E(r) after the impact). Therefore, some
electromagnetic energy turns out to be missing. We conjecture that it has
been spent, with the help of the mechanical constraint, to allow the variation
of the direction of the wave-front of an angle π
2ζ. For a moment, this
energy has gone elsewhere, compensated by something which is not of an
electromagnetic kind. We would like to ﬁnd out what is. To this end, let us

(7.3)

Note that, dimensionally, the vector G corresponds to an acceleration. In
the case under study, at y = 0, G is oriented as the vector (0,
1, 0), with
an inﬁnite magnitude. If we imagine the wave as a bundle of rays (we saw in
section 5 that the two things are strictly related), then G provides a measure
of their curvature. When we are dealing with a free wave, the rays proceed
along straight-lines. Corresponding to this situation, we have G = 0. When
the rays hit the wall, then G becomes diﬀerent from zero. In the particular
case we are examining, G is a singularly distributed ﬁeld, but if we allow the
rays to change their trajectories smoothly, then G is going to be ﬁnite. This
would give the idea of a centripetal time-varying acceleration, responsable
for the rotation of the rays and the corresponding wave-fronts.

−

In the coming sections, we will make evident that a nonvanishing vector
G appears each time a wave evolves without following the Huygens principle,
as a consequence of external perturbations. Some suitable way of estimating
the magnitude G should allow us to compensate the missing electromagnetic
energy. By the way, the theory is not going to be easy. In section 13, we will
discover that, in order to change the trajectories of the rays, it is necessary to
pass through a modiﬁcation of the space-time structure. Thus, we cannot be
more precise, until we are ready to carry out our analysis in the framework
of general relativity. Before that, we have to work a little more on the
deﬁnition (7.3). This will be done in section 9. For the moment, let us put
together other basic facts.

We now vary the polarization of the incident wave of 90 degrees (see
ﬁgure 5). For y = 0, the component, orthogonal to the reﬂecting wall, of
the magnetic ﬁeld must be zero. At the same time, the whole electric ﬁeld
vanishes (since, for y approaching to zero, the ﬁeld E(r) is opposite to E(i)).
Therefore, more electromagnetic energy is missing when the wave hits the
wall. Actually, in this case, the eﬀects of the obstacle are stronger: together
with the deviation of the wave-front, we also observe a torsion that modiﬁes
the polarization by 180 degrees. Such a torsion process is instantaneuos, but
qualitatively similar to that corresponding to a circularly-polarized plane
wave, like the one for example expressed by the following ﬁelds:

E = (c cos ω(t

y/c), 0, c sin ω(t

y/c))

−

−

32

6
B = ( sin ω(t

−

−

−

(7.4)

where the polarization constantly changes at ﬁnite speed. We note that this
wave is also a solution to Maxwell equations and is more “energetic” than
the corresponding one with constant polarization.

If, together with reﬂection, we also have refraction within a medium of
diﬀerent density, the study is more involved. When reaching the plane of
reﬂection the rays bifurcate. In our opinion, this is due to the arbitrariness
of the vector J at the time of the impact (for example because P is zero).
The incident wave splits into two solutions (the reﬂected and the refracted
waves), both compatible with the same boundary conditions on the plane
y = 0, brought by the incoming solution. We do not necessarily have bifur-
cation each time that P is zero (this actually happens very frequently), but
only when, in addition to this, suitable uncommon conditions are veriﬁed.

Based on the above observations, we conclude this section with a little
philosophical dissertation. The equations (3.1)-(3.2)-(3.3) are of local and
deterministic type. Hence, for given initial data, the solution is uniquely
determined. Nevertheless, there may be circumstances in which, following
the evolution of a certain solution, several other branches of solutions of the
equation (3.1) may be admissible. As we noticed, this could be true because
the evolution of the vector J turns out to be compatible with diﬀerent op-
tions. Thus, the original solution splits, and this event is also deterministic.
As a matter of fact, when the right conditions are fulﬁlled, an incident wave
bifurcates, giving raise to a reﬂected and a refracted wave. There is no
uncertainty: both the solutions are systematically observed. However, this
situation becomes extremely unstable when reversing time. We are indeed
allowed to think that, marching backward in time, the inverse of a bifurca-
tion phenomenon could occur. In this case, as a ﬁlm runs in reverse, two
waves would meet in perfect phase and melt, producing a single wave. Nev-
ertheless, this event has zero probability of happening. A little perturbation
is suﬃcient to modify completely the evolution of the two waves, with no
chances of seeing their fusion.

In conclusion, our equations are of hyperbolic type, deterministic and en-
ergy preserving. Nevertheless the particular nature of the nonlinear term can
be a source of instabilities when reversing the sign of time. The consequence
is that some original information can get lost, and there is no practical way
to recover it by following the reverse path. We ask ourselves if this could be
an explanation (at least in part) for the second law of thermodynamics.

8 Diﬀraction phenomena

We continue our qualitative analysis on the interaction of waves with mat-
ter. The second example that we take into account is the developing of
diﬀraction, where an electromagnetic wave encounters an aperture. Once
again, for simplicity, the device used to generate the phenomenon is a pure
mathematical abstraction. So, let us suppose that a plane monocromatic
wave propagates in the direction of the y-axis (with y increasing) and hits
a perfect-conducting wall at y = 0. This time, however, there is a passage
through the strip 0

a, for some positive width a.

For z < 0 and z > a the wave is reﬂected. Actually, it is not a perfect reﬂec-
tion, since it is aﬀected by some perturbations originating at the boundaries
of the aperture. Here, we neglet this aspect and focus our attention on the
study of the sources of these disturbances.

We assume that along the two straight-lines y = 0, z = 0 and y = 0,
z = a, instantaneous electric currents push the electric ﬁeld to zero, so that
the condition E = 0 is enforced (see [5], p. 559). At the instant in which
the wave reaches the obstacle, the electric ﬁeld develops discontinuities.
Therefore, its divergence is a concentrated Dirac distribution along the above
mentioned straight-lines. Thus, for y = 0, it is easy to realize that:

divE = c [δ0(z)

δa(z)] sin ωt

On the other hand, for 0 < z < a, we can expect that:

P = (0, c(sin ωt)2, 0)

lim

(8.2)

(8.3)

because these are points in which the wave does not hit the obstacle.

Next, let us examine more in detail what happens on the straight-lines
y = 0, z = 0 and y = 0, z = a. Using equation (3.1) and neglecting the term
curlB, the remaining nonlinear term brings an instantaneous rotation of the
electric ﬁeld. As a matter of fact, let us deﬁne in Cartesian coordinates

34

J.

±

E = (0, v, w) and B = (u, 0, 0), where u, v and w do not depend on x.
When y < 0, we trivially have v = 0. In terms of the new unknowns, the
equation (3.1) takes the form:

vt = uz −

Ξw

wt =

uy + Ξv

−

(8.4)

where Ξ = s(u)c(divE)/√v2 + w2 = s(u)c(vy + wz)/√v2 + w2 and s(u) is
the sign of u.

We have uz = 0. Neglecting uy (which is bounded), the system (8.4)
is equivalent to a rotation with angular speed Ξ (note that, for z = 0 and
z = a, Ξ is inﬁnite because so it is wz). The rotation is anti-clockwise at the
points (x, 0, 0). It is clockwise at the points (x, 0, a). This is true whatever
the sign of the electric ﬁeld (note that E and B change sign together and
J always maintains the same orientation). Even if the rotation is at inﬁnite
speed, the rotation angle is ﬁnite and depends on the magnitude of the
ﬁelds. In practice, by equation (3.1), a sudden change of the quantity divE
E, forcing the ﬁeld to vary in the direction
is balanced by a modiﬁcation of ∂
∂t

×

This behavior is not at all in agreement with what is usually observed.
The diﬀraction is a diﬀusive phenomenon. Therefore, referring to ﬁgure 6, we
should expect a clockwise rotation at (x, 0, 0) and an anti-clockwise rotation
at (x, 0, a). We can correct this inconsistency by changing the sign to the
, which amounts, in other terms, to inverting the sign of the
vector product
electric ﬁeld. The conclusion we can draw is quite astonishing. According
to our equations, the standard right-handed product
is not suitable for
describing a natural event like diﬀraction. Answering the question raised in
section 5, the correct side of the mirror is the one where
is left-handed.
This means that, if we do not wish to modify the model equations, we need to
switch the polarity of the electric ﬁelds, in such a way an electron turns out
to be positive and a proton negative. We will return to this subject in section
15. The asymmetry of our universe and, consequently, the determination of
its parity, is a problem that emerged about 50 years ago. The eﬀects of this
dichotomy were predicted by Lee and Yang (see for instance [12], p.534),

above arguments are free from errors, then here may lie the solution to the
problem.

In a more realistic situation, the change of direction of the Poynting
vector ﬁeld is not instantaneous, but develops smoothly. It is very important
to point out that the diﬀraction comes as a consequence of the nonlinearity
of the model equation (3.1), and not from the imposition of some artiﬁcial

boundary conditions at the points (x, 0, 0) and (x, 0, a), as supposed by other
theories (see for instance [5], chapter XI). The successive evolution of the
wave after the obstacle follows the Huygens principle. In fact, for y > 0, the
wave is free. It displays a slight diﬀusion due to the rearrangement of the
electromagnetic ﬁelds, described before. It is well-known that the behavior
depends on the ratio between the width a and the frequency ω/2π. We do
not investigate this aspect, since it has been intensively studied in the past.
Here, we were only concerned with detecting the mechanism that leads to
the deﬂection of the rays, when they meet the border of the aperture. The
same mechanism takes place in the scattering of two solitons (see section 5),
when their electromagnetic ﬁelds collide, with reciprocal inﬂuence.

Some quantitative information can be recovered by examining equation
(3.5). We know that the Poynting vector P presents a natural pulsating
variation along the direction of propagation of the wave. But, during the
encounter with the obstacle, we have to add another variation, due to the
instantaneous transversal change to the ﬂux of energy. As we can see from
ﬁgure 6, during the impact, the vector ﬁeld P shows some dispersion and its

36

c2divP
divergence suddenly grows. Thus, for just a moment, the quantity
registers a negative peek. To restore the normal energy ﬂux in (3.5), some
corrective term, taking care of the “reaction” of the obstacle, should be
added. In fact, as in the previous section, the change of curvature of the
rays is accompanied by the creation of a new vector ﬁeld G, concentrated
on the obstacle. We better formalize this idea in section 9.

−

Anyhow, in spite of the good achievements, we still have some problems
to ﬁx. Suppose that the incident wave is polarized in a diﬀerent way, for
instance by applying a rotation of 90 degrees:

E = (c sin ω(t

y/c), 0, 0)

B = (0, 0,

−

sin ω(t

y/c))

(8.5)

−

−

On the contact with the straight-lines y = 0, z = 0 and y = 0, z = a, we
should now observe a prompt change of the magnetic ﬁeld B, along the
direction z. This event is not modelled by our equations, since we need to
suppose that divB can be diﬀerent from zero.
In order to proceed, it is
necessary to correct the model in such a way that the ﬁelds E and cB have
the same role, as in the classical Maxwell equations. We also discuss this in
the coming section.

9 Adding the mechanical terms

Based on some problems emerged in the previous sections, we make a ﬁrst
adaptation of the set of equations (3.1)-(3.2)-(3.3), with the aim of bringing
to the same level the two ﬁelds E and cB. Thus, the new formulation is:

(9.1)

(9.2)

Now, (9.1)-(9.2) do not change if we replace E by cB and cB by
E, as
in the Maxwell equations. This makes the model invariant under change
of polarization. Clearly, if the divergence of B vanishes, we come back to
equations (3.2)-(3.3). The possibility for divB to be diﬀerent from zero, does
not imply the existence of magnetic monopoles, as the condition divE
= 0
does not imply the existence of electrical charges. However, the issue is
delicate, and will be further discussed at the end of section 14 and in section
15.

−

−

The modiﬁed version (9.1)-(9.2) allows for an even greater space of so-
lutions. The spherical waves analyzed in section 4 can be now constructed
with the electric ﬁeld following the parallels, and the magnetic ﬁeld following
the meridians. In this case, we have divE = 0. Diﬀerent other intermediate
polarizations, which may also vary in time, can be considered as well.

Finally, we can also get solutions as the one shown in ﬁgure 2.

It is

suﬃcient to set:

E = (cf (x, y)g(t

z/c), 0, 0)

−

−

B = (0, f (x, y)g(t

z/c), 0)

J = (0, 0, 1)

(9.3)

where f is an arbitrary function, decaying to zero near the boundary of a
bidimensional domain Ω. The function g can also be arbitrary. If g vanishes
outside a ﬁnite interval, then the solution in (9.3) is a travelling soliton, as
the ones considered in section 5. The diﬀerence with respect to section 5 is
that those solutions satisﬁed the condition divB = 0. Hence, in cylindrical
coordinates, the solutions given in (5.9) satisfy (9.1)-(9.2), without the need
to enforce relation (5.10).

However, we are not completely satisﬁed yet. There is too much symme-
try now, while we know that, in most natural phenomena, the role of ﬁelds
E and cB is very well diﬀerentiated. Actually, the diﬀerence is detectable
when a wave interacts with matter. We can take for example the case of the
wire-grid polarizers, where an incident wave hits a grate of parallel metallic
wires. If the wave is polarized with the electric ﬁeld orthogonal to the wires,
then it passes the obstacle almost undisturbed (if its wave-length is much
smaller than the distance between two wires of the grate). If the electric
ﬁeld has a component along the direction of the wire, then the wave changes
the polarization of a certain angle.

Insisting on a similar example, we can go back to the end of section
8. We are now able to study the diﬀraction of the wave given in (8.5),
where the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the x-axis. Using the equations (9.1)-
(9.2), we come to the same conclusions obtained for the wave given in (8.1),
polarized in another way. But this result is incorrect, because in the case of
the wave (8.5), together with the diﬀraction of the rays, there should be a
change of the polarization after passing the obstacle, which is not modelled
by the equations (9.1)-(9.2), and which is not present in the case of the wave
polarized as in (8.1).

In addition to the above observations, we also note in the reﬂection-
refraction phenomenon, that the way the incident wave is polarized aﬀects

38

the ﬁnal result. Thus, it is necessary to further improve the model. For this
purpose it will be useful the material collected in sections 6, 7 and 8.

We need to introduce new vector ﬁelds (not of electromagnetic type),
which are activated each time a free wave becomes a constrained wave. Let
us begin by deﬁning a velocity vector ﬁeld V. We will ask all the vectors to
V
be of constant norm, in particular:
= c, where c is the speed of light.
|
Therefore, what really matters is the orientation of the vectors. The idea
is that V is the tangent vector ﬁeld to a bundle of light rays. An example
is given by the vector ﬁeld cJ, introduced in section 3, representing the
direction of propagation of a wave-front.

|

Afterwords, we propose the following system of time-dependent partial

diﬀerential equations, with three unknown vector ﬁelds:

will become clearer, the knowledge of the vector ﬁeld V is secondary with
respect to the determination of its variation G.

39

Again, we assume to be in vacuum, with no particles of any kind around.
In spite of that, the equation (9.9) has strong similarity with the Lorentz
law for a density of charge moving at the speed of light. Actually, all the
ingredients are there. Multiplying by a mass, the left-hand side in (9.9)
is a force:
its component along the direction of motion turns out to be
proportional to the electric force ﬁeld, while the orthogonal component is
proportional to the magnetic force ﬁeld. As we can see, the symmetry is
broken, so that the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds cannot be interchanged
anymore. But, this only happens in the case of constrained waves (G
= 0).
For free waves, we recall that the relation (6.18), corresponding to V = cJ
E, we obtain
and G = 0, is true. Moreover, replacing E by cB and cB by
the relation (6.19), which is also true. Therefore, all the free waves, no
matter what kind of polarization they have, are included in the new model.
The interesting part is to study the behavior of constrained waves. We will
discuss some general properties in section 10.

−

Before going ahead, we feel that some clariﬁcation is necessary concern-
ing the meaning of the word “mass”, used, perhaps improperly, several times
in the paper. In our discussion, there are no masses in classical sense, since
there are no elementary particles of any sort. Nevertheless, we needed to
make distinction, in terms of dimensionality, between electromagnetic and
mechanical (later they will be called gravitational) ﬁelds. This responsabil-
ity has been given to the constant µ, which provides the dimensional link
between the two “ﬂavors”. Although other names could have been appro-
priate to this purpose, the choice of the term “mass” is not incidental, since,
as we proceed with our arguments, it will come out to be consistent with
the standard setting.

10 Properties of the new set of equations

The new system of equations (9.4)-(9.5)-(9.6) is able to describe electro-
magnetic phenomena where the wave-front, locally evolving in the direction
determined by V, could be subjected to transversal perturbations modifying
the trajectories of the rays. The propagation of the wave is governed by the
ﬁrst two equations. Through a feed-back process, the third equation, from
the current knowledge of the local electromagnetic ﬁelds, allows for the de-
V, setting up the new direction of motion. This coupling
termination of D

is possible because we have been able to include the vector V in the descrip-
tion of the electromagnetic part, in the same way the term cJ was added to

We can compare the evolution of an electromagnetic phenomenon to
that of an inviscid ﬂuid, whose mass density, up to dimensional constants, is
given by ρ = divE. Note, however, that a real “mass” does not exist. Note
also that ρ can also attain negative values. We do not deﬁne the density
ρ = divB for reasons that will be detailed at the end of section 14. The
following continuity equation holds (see also (3.4)):

c, showing rarefactions and compressions,. More properly, it evolves like
an incompressible ﬂuid, but with density not equally distributed in space.
Regarding a spherical wave, one has divV > 0 and G = 0. As expected,
this implies that the mass density diminishes (in absolute value), while time
passes, since it spreads on spheres of growing area. In both examples (the
plane and the spherical) we have curlV = 0. In other words, the ﬂuid is
irrotational.

Let us suppose that V is a gradient, i.e.: V =

Ψ, where Ψ is a scalar
potential not depending on time. Then, the corresponding ﬂuid is irrota-
tional. Thanks to (9.7), we trivially have:

This conﬁrms a remarkable result: the eikonal equation (hence, the evolution
of the wave-fronts based on the Huygens principle) is perfectly compatible
with the condition G = 0. This analytic property, obtained without approx-
imations, goes beyond the famous limits of geometrical optics. So, here, with
a very elementary proof, we obtained another important result.

viewed as a suitable stress tensor
applied to the vector normal to the
front of propagation (see for instance [1], p.10). As we already know, forced
variations of the electric ﬁeld produce changes in the motion of the fronts. If
these are combined with forced variations of the magnetic ﬁeld, a torsion is
also introduced, which modiﬁes the polarization of the wave. We guess, that,
when the external perturbations end, the electromagnetic ﬁelds return to
their natural equilibrium in which

the ﬂuid takes again an irrotational motion. From the examples discussed in
sections 7 and 8, this behavior corresponds to what is commonly observed
in nature, and certainly comes from the minimization of some Lagrangian.
At the moment, we do not however have theoretical explanation for this
conjecture.

Furthermore, we note that stationary electric ﬁelds, for example with
B = 0, are not longer solutions. We can check this by examining relations
(9.9) and (10.2). They force the velocity ﬁeld V to turn itself around (V

43

deviates in the direction of E, but E remains orthogonal to it). More gener-
ally, equation (9.6) requires the solutions to be in continuous evolution. We
contend that the new system of equations does not admit stationary solu-
tions having ﬁnite energy. We made the same consideration in section 5, in
the particular case of solitons. Nevertheless, there could be nonstationary
solutions localized in space. We can imagine for instance the case of two (or
more) solitons, in such a way that they are constrained, by inﬂuencing their
electromagnetic ﬁelds each other, to revolve around a common center. We
still do not have all the elements to study these phenomena, which, as we
will see in the following pages, need the environment of general relativity to
be stated properly. Some remarks about the case of two rotating solitons
will be given in section 15.

We are unable at the moment to obtain the equations (9.4)-(9.5)-(9.6)
from the minimization of a suitable action function as we did in section 6
(concerning (9.6) alone, something in this direction will be obtained in the
next section). One may consider the usual Lagrangian L = 2(c2

Then, we could minimize the same action function given in (6.6) using the
constraint (10.12). Nevertheless, we would not obtain the desired result,
since (10.12) is too restrictive. In this way, we only get a set of equations
describing free waves. As a matter of fact, we can prove that, if V has
the same direction as A, then one automatically has G = 0. Assuming
divB = 0, this check can be done as follows. Considering (6.1) and (10.12),

we do not impose the condition (9.7), implying that the sum in (11.1) is

At this point, it should be noted that, by choosing

part of the Lagrangian in (11.2) vanishes. This does not mean that it van-

second part of the Lagrangian is zero when A
V = cΦ, which is very similar
to the condition (6.17), obtained from the constraint (6.12) (see also (10.12)).
This coincidence is quite signiﬁcant. Perhaps, in the future, it will suggest
a way to build a Lagrangian for the entire set of equations (9.4)-(9.5)-(9.6).
By multiplying the equation (11.7) by Vi, i = 1, 2, 3, and the equation

·

(11.10) by V0, we get:

F ikVkVi = 0

(11.11)

where the sum is for i and k going from 0 to 3. This also trivially follows from
the anti-symmetry of the tensor F ik. The equation (6.11) is also written as:

the right-hand side is equal to cdivB. In a more contracted form, the last

V0 Fjik =

(11.15)

±
In the results obtained above, we basically considered V as the velocity
ﬁeld of an inﬁnitesimal particle moving at the speed of light. On the other
hand, in a wave there are inﬁnite contiguous trajectories. As a matter
of fact, the evolution of a wave is a global phenomenon, that should be
taken as a whole, and not studied independently along each stream-line.
For such a more in depth analysis, we need to work in the context of general
relativity. We are going to show that the passage of a wave modiﬁes the
space-time structure. For a free wave this does not aﬀect the evolution of
the wave itself (see section 13), but for constrained waves the change of the
geometry inﬂuences their entire behavior. The analysis will allow us to ﬁnd
the coupling between the ﬁelds describing the wave and space-time geometry,
hence the link between electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena.

We ﬁrst need to introduce some classical deﬁnitions. Mainly, we adopt
the notation used in [7]. The space-time geometry is locally determined by a
symmetric bilinear form (the metric tensor), whose coeﬃcients are denoted
by gij. Then, the Christoﬀel symbols are deﬁned in the following way:

Γi

kj =

gim
2  

∂gmk
∂xj

+

∂gmj
∂xk −

∂gkj
∂xm !

(11.16)

49

where we sum over the index m. The coeﬃcients gij are in such a way that:

gim gmj = δij

(11.17)

The coeﬃcients gij are adimensional, while the Christoﬀel symbols are the
inverse of a distance. If the space is “ﬂat” (Euclidean or Minkowski space),
all the Christoﬀel symbols vanish. In this case, one has gik = gik = eiδik.
As usual, we denote by g the determinant (which is negative) of the tensor
gik. A lemma due by Ricci (see [7], p.129) claims that the 4-divergence of
the metric tensor is zero. In detail, one has:

∇kgik =

1
√

g

−

∂(√

g gik)

−

+ Γi

jmgjm = 0

(11.18)

where
∇k is the covariant diﬀerentiation operator. The same is true for the
coeﬃcients gik. Moreover, the coeﬃcients gik are said to be harmonic when:

1
√

g

−

∂(√

g gik)

−

= 0

(11.19)

Next, we deﬁne V i = gimVm. The values Vm are the entries of a velocity
vector expressed in the coordinates system x0, x1, x2, x3. Let us set V 0 = c.
Then, the condition (9.7) is generalized in the following way:

V iVi = gikVkVi = gimV iV m = 0

(11.20)

In this more general framework, the equations (11.7) and (11.10) are

rewritten as:

DV i
Dt

+ Γi

jkV jV k =

−

F imVm

for i = 0, 1, 2, 3

(11.21)

For i = 0, 1, 2, 3, we also deﬁne (see [7], p.217):

∇mV i
From (11.21) we easily recover the orthogonality relations:

jkV jV k = V m

Gi =

+ Γi

DV i
Dt

GiV i = GiVi = 0

(11.22)

(11.23)

where Gi = gimGm. Finally, let us deﬁne G = (G1, G2, G3), which is dimen-
sionally equivalent to an acceleration.

50

In general relativity, the gravitational ﬁeld is somehow identiﬁed with
the tensor gij. Of course, the vector G may vanish without having that
the space is ﬂat. Although G does not fully characterize the properties of
space-time, for us it will be the “real” gravitational ﬁeld, that is the one
we can measure in our everyday life. In the following, G will be called the
vector gravitational ﬁeld.

The equation (11.21) enables us to understand how the trajectory of a
“thin” solitary wave can be distorted when immerged in a given gravitational
ﬁeld (having G
= 0). Being the soliton a free wave, the right-hand side of
(11.21) vanishes (see (6.18)). Thus, its path follows a suitable geodesic in
space-time, the shape of which is determined by the external gravitational
ﬁeld. This should correspond to some transversal bending in the direction
locally individuated by the vector G. With this reasoning, we have to ne-
glect a couple of facts, both due to the change of direction: the modiﬁcation
of the electromagnetic ﬁelds and the “gravitational reaction” of the soliton
(a curving wave produces new gravitational ﬁeld). As we argued in sec-
tion 10, these should be minor eﬀects, since the wave, for some principle
of least action, tries to compensate the electromagnetic ﬁelds in order to
enforce (6.18). From the point of view of the soliton, the path followed is
straight, even if it actually travels on a curved geodesic. To get more reliable
quantitative results, we must solve a quite complicated system of equations.
Comparing the computed results with the experimental evidence, one could
probably evaluate the constant µ. This is however an exercise that we would
prefer to avoid here. Also if some theoretical passages may be formally sim-
ilar, the important clue is that there is no need to suppose that a soliton
has an inﬁnitesimal mass to justify that is attracted by a gravitational ﬁeld.
After recalling that F ik is an anti-symmetric tensor, in general coordi-

The last three terms in (12.5) are actually zero for the following reasons. In
the ﬁrst one we recognize the second and the third components of N and M,
which vanish, if we assume that the equations (9.4) and (9.5) are satisﬁed.
The second one contains the ﬁrst component of the vector E + V
B, which
vanishes in the case of a free wave. Concerning the last term, the part in
parenthesis is the ﬁrst component of the vector c2B
E, which also
vanishes (see (6.19)).

V

−

×

The property (12.2) is reported in many texts (see for instance [7], p.97).
But, it is extremely important to observe that, in the case of Maxwell equa-
tions, the last two terms are zero because divE = 0 and divB = 0. This is
the reason why we decided to double check equation (12.2), which turns out

53

to be fulﬁlled even when the divergence of the ﬁelds E and B is not zero
(the assumption we supported throughout this paper). Therefore (12.2)
holds under weaker hypotheses.

As expected, a converse statement also holds: assuming that (12.2) is
true, then we can recover the equations (9.4) and (9.5). This amounts to
diﬀerentiate the equation of energy conservation, in order to obtain the
corresponding Euler equations. Arguing as we did to get (12.5), we arrive
at:

Assuming, as previously done, that we are dealing with a free wave, after
eliminating in (12.6) the vanishing terms, we are left with (M
B).
Since, by hypothesis, the equation (12.2) is true, if the vector N is zero,
then M must be also zero (likewise, if M is zero, then N is zero). Therefore,
(9.4) is satisﬁed if and only if (9.5) is satisﬁed. This is the same situation
B+curlE and divB

It is to be noted that V has the same direction of E

B, which is also

. So, from the energy tensor it is not possible to ﬁgure
out what the parameter λ is, as well as the polarization of the wave. This
information has to be provided with the initial conditions. For instance, the
wave in (7.4), circolarly polarized, produces the same tensor U ik of a linearly
polarized wave, moving in the same direction with twice the intensity. As
a further consequence, we ﬁnally observe that U ik does not change if E

We can now argue in a general framework. For a given metric tensor gik,
the electromagnetic stress tensors must be modiﬁed in the following way

The proof of (12.12) is given for instance in [9], p.606, for the classical
Maxwell equations. This is also true in the case of our new set of equa-
tions (hence under weaker hypotheses). At the end of this section, we will
evaluate the 4-divergence of the tensor U ik in general coordinates. Such
generalizations are unavoidable since, even the simple case of a plane wave
provokes a modiﬁcation of the space-time geometry, requiring to work with
tensors of the form (12.10). These aspects will be better studied in the next
section.

When the electromagnetic phenomenon is not a free wave, we cannot
expect that (12.2) and its generalization (12.12) are veriﬁed. This means

55

that the system constituted by the sole electromagnetic part is not energy
preserving. We know that, in this case, the energy balance has to take care
of the mechanical eﬀects. Thus, we study how to introduce them. We start
by assuming that divB = 0, leaving the discussion of the more general case
to section 14. Then, let us deﬁne a mass tensor as follows:

Mik = ViVk divE

written as:

where the last equality is a consequence of (11.21). Hence, in a ﬂat space
(Gi = 0), the 4-divergence of the mass tensor vanishes. Moreover, we observe
that the mass tensor does not contain the pressure term (on the other hand,
an equation of state is not deﬁned).

In order to combine electromagnetic and mechanical eﬀects, we sum up

the corresponding tensors, by deﬁning:

Tik =

µUik + Mik

(12.19)

µ

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where the constant µ is dimensionally equivalent to a charge divided by a
mass. It follows that Tik has the same dimension of a curvature, that is the
inverse of the square of a distance. Now, in a ﬂat space-time, even if we are
not dealing with a free wave, we may write:

∂T ik
∂xk

(12.20)

As a matter of fact, due to (9.9), if the term µ(E + V

Before ending this section, we would like to verify that (12.21) actually
corresponds to the Euler equations. As a matter of fact, (12.21) is satisﬁed

57

when (11.25), (11.27) and (11.21) are true. We recall that these three last
equations are the generalizations of (9.4), (9.5), (9.6), respectively. For the
moment, we will only treat the case in which divB = 0, leaving the general
discussion to section 14. Let us start by computing the 4-divergence of the
tensor U ik. First of all, we have:
∇kU ik =

− ∇k(gmj F imF kj) + 1
∇k(Fmj F jk) + 1
4 gik

4 ∇k(gikFmjF mj)
∇k(FmjF mj)

(12.22)
where we notice that gmj F im = gimFmj (thanks to (12.11)), that F kj =
F jk and that, due to (11.18), it is allowed to exchange the metric tensor

−
with the covariant derivative (see also [7], p130). Going ahead, one gets:

(12.23)
where we used (11.25) (with V 0 = c). The other passages have been obtained
by a suitable renaming of the indices. Recalling the deﬁnition of Fikj given
in (11.26), we have:

∇kU ik =

(12.24)

In the last passage two terms have been deleted, since, after renaming the
indices, they resulted in being equal and with opposite signs. The last term
in (12.24) is zero because of (11.26) (remember that we are studying the
case divB = 0, thus F123 = 0). Of course, the ﬁnal result is zero when, for
instance, ρE = 0, as in the classical Maxwell case. But it is also zero when
F imVm = 0, which corresponds to the case of a free electromagnetic wave.
On the contrary, we need to consider the contribution of the mass tensor. If
Fmjk = 0, taking into account the relations (12.19) and (12.18), one ﬁnally
obtains:

(13.3)

In the previous section, we build the symmetric tensor Tik that includes both
the energy contribution of an electromagnetic wave and that of mechanical
type, taking into account possible deviations from the natural propagation
path of the wave. The properties of Tik insure the preservation of energy and
momentum. Hence, we can put Tik on the right-hand side of the Einstein
equation:

are deﬁned in (11.16). Let us note that, by (12.10) and (12.17), the metric
tensor, which is now our unknown, also appears on the right-hand side of
(13.1).

We soon examine the response of equation (13.1) to the passage of the
most elementary plane wave. We take for instance the expression given in
z/c), divE = 0 and divB = 0.
(2.5), where we have E1 = cB2 = c sin ω(t

The scalar curvature R is zero.

Being zero the divergence of E, the mass tensors Mik e M ik vanish.
Actually, one should check that ρE = 0. This is also true, as the comments
at the end of this section illustrate. The tensors Uik and U ik have to be
computed through (12.10). First of all, one has:

−
where u = B2 = E1/c. Note that (V0, V) = (c, 0, 0, c) and (V 0, V 1, V 2, V 3) =
c). Hence, one gets F ikVk = 0, from which we deduce that the wave
(c, 0, 0,

z/c), which is
the solution we were looking for. There are surely other geometries compati-
ble with the same plane wave. Note that the one presented here satisﬁes the
relation (11.19). We also observe that there are points in which the metric

−

becomes singular, that is, the determinant g is zero. Another equivalent
possibility is to exchange g11 and g22 in (13.4), and make p oscillate with
the magnetic ﬁeld. Comments about this option will be given in the next
section.

The solution just obtained can be assimilated to a transversal (perfectly
plane) gravitational wave, travelling in phase with the electromagnetic one.
It must also be noted that, even if the space is oﬃcially non Euclidean, the
geodesics involved in the motion of the wave are straight-lines. The ﬁeld
G, deﬁned by (11.22), is identically zero. This is in agreement with our
viewpoint: the geometry may be deformed, but there is no creation of a real
gravitational vector ﬁeld.

Pure gravitational solutions resembling plane waves, were formerly de-
tected in [3]. We have been able to get the above explicit (and very simple)
solution because we were resolute enough to assume the dependence from
the metric tensor of the right-hand side of the Einstein equation. As far as
we could deduce from the current literature, in contrast to our general ap-
proach to the problem, it is customary to construct the electromagnetic en-
ergy tensor in vacuum (thus, in Minkowski space-time), also because such an
assumption is supposed (erroneously) to simplify the computations. Then,
one comes to a set of solutions, but, as we proved, this is not the correct set-
ting. Note also that, commonly, gravitational waves are searched among the
solutions of the linearized homogeneous Einstein equation, obtained after
perturbation of the ﬂat space-time.

We can recover the laws of motion by evaluating the 4-divergence of the
tensor T ik in (13.10). The geometry is non Euclidean, therefore, the relation

(13.15)

in such a way that the coordinates x and y are syncronized with the electric
ﬁeld (the reasons for this choice will be explained at the end of section 14).
In this case, the nonvanishing coeﬃcients of the Ricci tensor are: R00 =
R03 = R30 = R33 = 2ω2/c2. They coincide with the respective coeﬃcients
of the stress tensor: T00 = T03 = T30 = T33 = 2ω2/c2. Therefore, once
again, the Einstein equation is veriﬁed. The wave is free and we have R = 0
and G = 0.

Slightly more complicated is the case of a plane wave where divE is non-
zero. This happens for instance when u = B2 = E1/c = f (x) sin ω(t
z/c).
As we know, the solution satisﬁes the equations (3.1), (3.2), (3.3), but not
the classical Maxwell equations. We suggest looking for a metric tensor of

Thus, the mass tensor is still vanishing. The Christoﬀel symbols are a little
diﬀerent from the ones in (13.5) (in particular Γ1
11 is not zero), but the
coeﬃcients of the Ricci tensor are exactly equal to those given in (13.6).

thereby admitting the same solution p obtained in the case of the plane wave
at uniform density. The laws of motion are the same as in (13.13). They
tell us that u and p shift at the speed of light along the z-axis. They do not
specify however the function f , which must be assigned through the initial
conditions.

We are ready to illustrate the case of a spherical wave. With the
same notation of sections 2 and 4, we set the coordinates in order to have:

gularities at the poles, the function f is not allowed to be constant. So, this
is similar to the case of a variable-density plane wave. We also have that
(V 0, V 1, V 2, V 3) = (c,

F is a primitive of f . The metric in (13.21) is the same as the one we
would have obtained if we had worked with a plane electromagnetic wave.
The fact that we are in spherical coordinates is actually contained in the
electromagnetic tensors (in which we ﬁnd ru in place of u). Note that
(V0, V1, V2, V3) = (c, c, 0, 0), from which one obtains the relation F ikVk = 0,
conﬁrming that the wave is free. As far as energy is concerned, we get:

The function u is the solution to (13.23), after assuming the appropriate
initial conditions.

The results of this section, although only restricted to the analysis of
free waves, bring to attention some important issues. Up to now, we have
claimed that a good theory of electromagnetism was meaningful only by
allowing divE to be diﬀerent from zero. Here instead we ﬁnd that ρE = 0.
In our opinion, what is happening can be explained as follows. The space-
time “reacts” to the passage of a wave, by varying itself in syncronism, in
order to make the 4-divergence of the electric ﬁeld vanish. The perturbation
of the geometry is however weak enough to maintain ﬁeld curvature G equal

64

to zero. The classical divergence divE may instead attain arbitrary values.
We ask ourselves if it is possible to set up an experiment showing that,
at some point and at a certain time, one has divE
= 0. Perhaps, this is
not possible since, due to the modiﬁcation of the metric, the instruments
are unavoidably aﬀected by the deformation of time and distances (with
respect to the Euclidean reference frame). Therefore, in place of divE, we
could end up measuring ρE. But the last quantity is always zero (a least for
free waves). As a consequence, we conclude that some divergence vanishes,
although is not the classical, but the relativistic one. According to this new
interpretation of the facts, in some sense the Maxwell theory was correct.

There is another point that needs to be clariﬁed. The problem is why
the geometry changes depending on the electric ﬁeld, and not the magnetic
ﬁeld, expecially after we said that for free waves the two ﬁelds have the
same role. Firstly, we note that, in all examples studied in this section,
the condition divB = 0 was always fulﬁlled. In addition, if similarly to ρE,
we deﬁne ρB, we discover that this new quantity is also zero (see section
14). If we imagine the wave like a ﬂuid in motion, then this condition says
that there is no ﬂow of some “magnetic density of matter”.
In truth, it
is reasonable to assume that a sole electromagnetic ﬂuid exists (not two, a
separate electrical one and a magnetic one). As will become clear in the
next section, where we analyze the case divB
= 0, such a ﬂuid turns out
to pulsate along a speciﬁc tangential direction (in principle, not necessarily
corresponding to that of the electric ﬁeld). Exchanging cause with eﬀect, in
section 14 we will support the following statement: from the behavior of the
natural events, we are inclined to name the direction of the electric ﬁeld as
being that identiﬁed by the transversal oscillations of the ﬂuid in motion.

Far more complicated phenomena show up, when we suppose that the
waves are no longer free (thus, G
= 0). In this context, the real gravitational
ﬁelds come into life. We do not have any speciﬁc examples to discuss, due to
the diﬃculty of the problems involved. Some hints will be given in section
15.

14 The divergence of the magnetic ﬁeld

In the previous sections, some situations were discussed under the hypoth-
esis divB = 0. Although our equations now have a general validity, the
assumption is necessary, for instance when introducing the potentials A
and Φ. Regarding this condition, we would like to add further comments

in this section. It is standard to introduce a transformation that exchanges
the role of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. This can be done through the

ˆF31 = F 02

The equation (14.12) is the generalization of (12.6) with N = 0 and
M = 0. In spite of its elegance, it is not very convincing, since it involves
two mass densities (see also the comments at the end of section 13). Let us
try to explain what is happening. Without going into technical detail, we
may make some remarks. We ﬁrst note that

after applying the dual twice, one gets the opposite of the original tensor.

where the second one is the dual of the ﬁrst one. As in (12.11) we have:
Fml. Moreover, we can check that the tensor Uik in (12.10)
F
does not change if in place of Fik and F ik we take
ik, respectively.
Therefore, the electromagnetic stress tensor does not depend on λ, even if
this parameter varies in space and time. Actually, we already observed in
section 12 that the energy tensor does not recognize the polarization of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld.

At this point, we can introduce the two new densities (see also (12.7)):

For λ = 1 the two versions are actually the same. Now, by letting λ to
vary, suppose that it is possible to modify the polarization of the ﬁelds
and

E
at each point, in order to get ρB = 0. In this way, we are left with

B

68

a single density ρE , which is the one to be used in constructing the mass
tensor Mik = ρE ViVk.

Let us restate the situation in brief. Every non-trivial electromagnetic
wave presents regions where the classical divergence of any of the two ﬁelds
is non-zero. The eletromagnetic energy tensor does not distinguish between
the two types of ﬁelds (electric or magnetic). In the end, what matters is the
intensity of the wave and the modality of propagation of its fronts, without
paying attention to the way each front has been parametrized. We can
associate a ﬂuid in motion at the speed of light with the wave. Independently
of the actual orientation of the ﬁelds E and B, we can locally build two other
, so that the ﬁrst one oscillates together with the ﬂuid and
ﬁelds
B
the second one satisﬁes div
= 0. This ﬁctitious change of polarization
has no inﬂuence on the electromagnetic energy tensor. The 4-divergence of
, when diﬀerent from zero, represents the mass density of the ﬂuid and
E
it is used to construct the mass tensor. This last tensor is added to the
electromagnetic energy one, to form the global energy tensor which is on
the right-hand side of the Einstein equation. In principle, the ﬁelds
B
are not directly associated with E and B. However, in the natural evolution
of electromagnetic phenomena, the two entities usually coincide.

simulates the real behavior of a wave generated by an inﬁnitesimal electric
dipole ascillating in a vertical direction. Somehow, the dipole imparts me-
chanical oscillations to the ﬂuid, in the same direction as the electric ﬁeld.
Formally, we can now exchange the role of the ﬁelds E and cB, by polarizing
the spherical wave by 90 degrees. In this new situation, we have divE = 0,
ρE = 0 and divB

Therefore, there is no longer coincidence of
with the corresponding

generated by an inﬁnitesimal magnetic monopole.

It is certainly true that our equations are not capable of recognising the
polarization of free waves. This is a property that comes with the initial
conditions. However, free waves are created by some causes inherent to nat-
ural events, which have a strong inﬂuence in determining polarization. The
problem resides at the origin, for example in the non existence of magnetic
monopoles (we will have a short discussion about this in section 15). Recall

69

6
that, in equation (9.6), the electric and magnetic ﬁelds cannot be inter-
changed. Certainly, this equation inﬂuences the creation of a spherical wave
through the mechanical oscillations of an electric charge. The conclusion
is that, at least for free waves, we can expect λ = 1, which implies that
the direction of transversal propagation of the ﬂuid is in accordance with
that of the electric ﬁeld. More precisely, this can be taken as a deﬁnition of
electric ﬁeld. Suppose that an external mechanical perturbation is applied
= E, in a direction not alligned with that of ﬁeld
to a free wave having
E, in such a way the direction of
changes. Then we may think that the
E
wave reacts by varying its polarization (see section 7, 8 and 9) in order to
correct its posture, bringing ﬁeld E to once again coincide with ﬁeld
. In
other words, the electric ﬁeld turns out to be identiﬁed with the one that
follows the transversal oscillations of the ﬂuid, and such a deﬁnition matches
reality.

15 Other developments and conclusions

We start by recalling the primary results obtained by the paper. In section
9, we introduced the following equations:

where E is the electric ﬁeld, B is the magnetic ﬁeld and V is a velocity ﬁeld
satisfying:

|
The constant µ is a charge divided by a mass, and c is the speed of light.

Then, in sections 11 and 12, we wrote the equations in covariant form.

with the rules provided in section 12 (in the construction of ρE =
remember to take into account the warnings at the end of section 14). Such a
coupling corresponds to a quite complex system, able to describe space-time
geometry in conjunction with electromagnetic phenomena.

Our set of equations contains the embryo of some of the main laws of
Physics.
In (15.1) and (15.2), we recognise the equations of electromag-
netism, more or less with the same structure as the Maxwell equations. We
discovered that, when V is irrotational, then (15.4) is the eikonal equation,
so that the Huygens principle is also latent. On the right-hand side of (15.1)
we partly recognize the Amp`ere law. The equation (15.3) expresses the
Lorentz law, anticipating the Newton law in the form of momentum equa-
tion for the dynamics of ﬂuids. In fact, we claimed that the light rays can
be assimilated to stream-lines of a certain ﬂuid of density ρE. Moreover, we
know that a continuity equation holds for ρE.

Throughout the paper, we assumed we were in a universe that we could
call “pre-Coulombian”. As a matter of fact, we developed a theory of elec-
tromagnetism without introducing any charges, and we spoke about ﬂuids
without having any masses. The only elements at our disposal were the
ﬁelds. Here comes the big question: can we now build matter from these
ﬁelds respecting the rules that we wrote? In other terms: can an elementary
particle be “solution” to our set of equations?

A particle is a quite complicated thing.

It has charge, magnetic mo-
mentum, spin, mass. It evolves and interacts with other particles according
to the rules of quantum mechanics. Can we contain all these factors in
a solution localized in space? This problem was mentioned in section 10
where we discussed possible solutions, consisting of a stable system of two
rotating solitons. Although the framework is still incomplete we collected
some pieces of evidence, whose details will shortly be discussed below, that

71

support the possibility of creating particles from ﬁelds. We recall that other
authors, through a qualitative analysis, followed a similar idea of building
electrons from photons (see for example [13] and the references therein).

We can give a rough idea of how a “particle solution” looks by examining
ﬁgure 7, that shows, projected on a plane, the rotation of the fronts around
an axis. From a qualitative viewpoint, ﬁeld E oscillates radially, but, in the
average, mainly pointing inward (or outward). This creates the polarity of
the electrical charge. Field B is orthogonal to the page. The rays form closed
orbits and their vector curvature G points toward the center, producing a
non-vanishing gravitational ﬁeld. If the sign of E is changed, then G again
points toward the inside (gravity has only one polarity). The displacement
of ﬁeld V matches the idea that something is “spinning”, and the associated
electromagnetic ﬂuid corresponds to a kind of vortex.

×

Still referring to ﬁgure 7, let us suppose that the particle is an electron.
Then E should be directed toward the center and, using the standard vector
, B points downwards. Nevertheless, a negative charge rotating
product
clockwise produces a spin angular momentum pointing downward and a
magnetic ﬁeld pointing upward, which is in contrast to what previously
found. As we remarked in section 8, this happens because we do not use
. In fact, the correct one is the left-handed
the suitable vector product
one. Since the magnetic dipole moment is independent of the sign of
, the
change of parity now conﬁrms that B points upward. If we want to maintain
the same set of equations, we can solve the problem just by changing the
sign of the electric ﬁeld, so that the electron has a chance of existing only
if the electric ﬁeld vectors point outward. We can still call this particle an
“electron” and give a negative sign to it, but we have to comply with the
new rule stating that currents ﬂow from a negative pole to a positive one.

×

×

Nevertheless, one can see that such a situation is still not compatible
with equations (15.1)-(15.2)-(15.3)-(15.4). One of the reasons is that the
outer orbits of the light rays are longer than the inner orbits, and this does
not match the condition (15.4), telling us that the information propagates
at constant speed. In order to have chances of ﬁnding solutions to the form
described above, the use of the general relativity framework is unavoidable.
The modiﬁcation of space-time geometry allows for the preservation of the
momentum of inertia (a typical mechanical concept), providing the “glue”
that keeps the particle together. The rotating wave follows the geodesics in
the new metric. At the same time, the curvature of such geodesics has to be
compatible, through (15.7), with the electromagnetic setting. The geometry
alters the relation between space and time in such a way that the rays, always

72

travelling at speed c, can accomplish paths of diﬀerent length in the same
amount of time. This recalls the problem of the rigid rotating disk in general
relativity. It is clear that the particle solution (if it exists) involves the use
of the whole set of equations. Therefore, its determination, even from the
point of view of numerical computations, is a demanding problem. Finally,
by heuristic arguments, one can recognise that a similar solution, where the
magnetic ﬁeld is exchanged with the electric one, should be forbidden by
equation (15.7). This would imply the impossibility of building magnetic
monopoles.

We ﬁnish the paper with some further speculations, not having enough
theoretical background. One positive aspect is that particle solutions are
expected to be extremely stable (an electron is quite a diﬃcult object to
destroy). Another aspect is that they are in some sense “unique” (there is
only one type of electron or proton), and this property raises other ques-
tions. The equations (9.1) and (9.2) are “scalable”, by meaning that we
can multiply the ﬁelds of a free wave by a constant, oncemore obtaining a
solution. Thus, free waves may be of any size and intensity. But, if we take
into account constrained waves, then this property is no longer true, since
(15.4) is not a scalable equation. Together with c, µ and χ in (13.1), another
constant is hidden in the set of equations (15.5)-(15.6)-(15.7)-(15.8), which
is related to some “magnitude” of the geometry. This result does not penal-
ize our theory. Actually it may give more strength to it. As a matter of fact,
we cannot have electrons of any size! We have no elements for quantifying
the values of the various parameters, unless we ﬁnd the particle solution
explicitly.

The last issue we discuss is the convenience of setting up experiments
validating our theory. The problem is left to the experts. However, we
think that many convincing arguments, also based on a multitude of prac-
tical observations, have already been collected, showing that our model is
adequate. The real breakthrough would be in predicting the realization of
an electromagnetic device, capable of producing gravitational ﬁeld.

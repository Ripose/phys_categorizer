1 Introduction

The question-mark in the title of the paper seems to be inadequate, because the
problem of the relativistic invariance of the Dirac equation had been solved many
years ago. The Dirac equation was invented by Dirac as a relativistic equation,
and its relativistic invariance was proved by Dirac [1]. The Dirac equation was
investigated by many authors [2] - [8], but this investigation was produced always
in the framework of the quantum principles. The proof of the relativistic invariance
of the Dirac equation can be found in any textbook on quantum mechanics. Why
does this question arise?

The fact is that, in general, the relativistic covariance of dynamic equations is
not suﬃcient for compatibility with the relativity principles. The Dirac equation
contains such speciﬁc quantities as γ-matrices. If we make a change of variables,
eliminating γ-matrices, we obtain the system of dynamic equations, which is not
relativistically covariant. Such a transition to eight hydrodynamic variables: 4-
vector jk = ¯ψγkψ, k = 0, 1, 2, 3 , 4-pseudovector Sk = i¯ψγ5γkψ, k = 0, 1, 2, 3, scalar
ϕ and pseudoscalar κ instead of eight real dependent variables ψ is necessary, if we
want to obtain classical analog

After such a change the system of partial diﬀerential equations (1.3) becomes
to be equivalent to a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations, because all dynamic
equations contain derivatives only in the direction of the vector jk. The ﬁeld of

3 Relativistic invariance

It is a common practice to think that if dynamic equations of a dynamic system
can be written in the relativistically covariant form, such a possibility provides
automatically relativistic character of considered dynamic system, described by these
equations. In general, it is valid only in the case, when dynamic equations do not
contain absolute objects, or these absolute objects has the Lorentz group as a group
of their symmetry [10]. The absolute object is one or several quantities, which are
the same for all states of the dynamic system [10]. A given external ﬁeld, or metric
tensor (when it is given, but not determined from the gravitational equations) are
examples of absolute objects. In the case of dynamic system
SD, described by the
action (1.1) the Dirac γ-matrices are absolute objects.
Anderson [10] investigated in details the role of absolute objects for symmetry
of dynamic systems. His conclusion is as follows. If a dynamic system is described
by dynamic equations, written in the covariant form, the symmetry group of the
dynamic system is determined by the symmetry group of these absolute objects.
Here we conﬁrm this result in a simple example, when the dynamic equations of the
certainly nonrelativistic dynamic system are written in a relativistically covariant
form.

Let us consider a system of diﬀerential equations, consisting of the Maxwell

equations for the electromagnetic tensor F ik in some inertial coordinate system

where qi = qi(τ ), i = 0, 1, 2, 3 describe coordinates of a pointlike charged particle as
functions of a parameter τ , the quantity lk, k = 0, 1, 2, 3 is a constant timelike unit
vector,

giklilk = 1;

(3.3)

and the speed of the light c = 1.

This system of equations is relativistically covariant with respect to quantities
qi, F ik, J i, li, gik, i.e.
it does not change its form at any Lorentz transformation,
which is accompanied by corresponding transformation of quantities qi, F ik, J i, li,
gik, where the quantities qi, J i, li are transformed as 4-vectors and the quantities
F ik, gik are transformed as 4-tensors

The reference to the quantities qi, F ik, J i, li, gik means that all these quanti-
ties are considered as formal dependent variables, when one compares the form of
dynamic equations written in two diﬀerent coordinate systems. For instance, if the
reference to J i is omitted in the formulation of the relativistic covariance, it means
that components of J i are considered as some functions of the coordinates x. Let
= 0, and ˜J i be the quantity J i, written in other coordinate system. Then, in
J i
general, J i and ˜J i are diﬀerent functions of the arguments x and ˜x respectively,
and the ﬁrst equation (3.1) has diﬀerent form in diﬀerent coordinate systems. In
other words, the dynamic equations (3.1)–(3.2) are not relativistically covariant, in
general, with respect to quantities qi, F ik, li, gik, if J i
= 0. Thus, for the rela-
tivistic covariance it is important both the laws of transformation and how each of
quantities is considered as a formal variable, or as some function of coordinates.

Following Anderson [10], we divide the quantities qi, F ik, J i, li, gik into two
parts: dynamic objects (variables) qi, F ik and absolute objects J i, li, gik. According
to deﬁnition of absolute objects they have the same value for all solutions of the
dynamic equations, whereas dynamic variables are diﬀerent, in general, for diﬀerent
solutions. If the dynamic equations are written in the relativistically covariant form,
their symmetry group is determined by the symmetry group of the absolute objects
J i, li, gik. Dynamic equations are compatible with the principles of relativity if the
Lorentz group is the symmetry group of the absolute objects.

≡

Let for simplicity J i

0. The symmetry group of the constant timelike vector
li is a group of rotations in the 3-plane orthogonal to the vector li. The Lorentz
group is a symmetry group of the metric tensor gik =diag
. Thus, the
1
−
symmetry group of all absolute objects li, gik, J i
0 is a subgroup of the Lorentz
group (rotations in the 3-plane orthogonal to li). As far as the symmetry group is a
subgroup of the Lorentz group and does not coincide with it, the system of equations
(3.1)–(3.2) is nonrelativistic (incompatible with the relativity principles).

Of course, the compatibility with the relativity principles does not depend on the
fact with respect to which quantities the relativistic covariance is considered. For
instance, let us consider a covariance of equations (3.1), (3.2) with respect to the
quantities qi, F ik, J i
0. It means that now the quantities li are to be considered
to be functions of x (in the given case these functions are constants), because a
reference to li as formal variables is absent. After the transformation to another

Now the equations (3.5), (3.6) do not contain the absolute object lk. It is easy to
see that these equations describe a nonrelativistic motion of a charged particle in
a given electromagnetic ﬁeld F ik. The fact that the equations (3.2) or (3.5) are
nonrelativistic is connected with the space-time splitting into space and time that
is characteristic for Newtonian mechanics. Any 3-plane, orthogonal to the vector lk,
consists of simultaneous events. This space-time splitting is described in diﬀerent
ways in equations (3.2) and (3.5). It is described by the constant timelike vector
lk in (3.2). In the equation (3.5) the space-time splitting is described by a special
choice of the coordinate system, whose time axis is directed along the vector lk, and
all events having the same coordinate t are simultaneous absolutely.

From physical viewpoint the Newtonian conception of space-time and that of
the special relativity distinguish in the number of invariants, describing the space-
time. In the Newtonian space-time conception there are two independent invariant
quantities: time t and distance r =
. This conception is associated with the de-
scription in terms of the time t and spatial coordinates x. This description is known
as noncovariant description, and (3.5), (3.6) is an example of such a description.
In the relativistic conception of the space-time there is only one invariant quantity:
space-time interval s = √c2t2
r2. The relativistic conception of the space-time as-

is known as (relativistically) covariant description. Can we describe a relativistic
phenomenon, using noncovariant description, associated with the Newtonian con-
ception? Yes, it is possible, and noncovariant description of relativistic phenomena
is used frequently. Vice versa, can we describe a nonrelativistic phenomenon, us-
ing relativistically covariant description, associated with the relativistic conception
of the space-time? Yes, it is possible. Relativistically covariant description of the
nonrelativistic phenomenon is possible, provided this description contains two in-
dependent space-time invariants: the time t and the distance r. To obtain two

{

invariants: t and r from the space-time interval s, one needs to introduce an ab-
solute constant timelike 4-vector lk ( lklk = 1). This vector is associated with the
space-time and admits one to construct two space-time invariants t and r from the
space-time interval s

t = xklk,

Thus, any appearance of the absolute constant timelike 4-vector lk in the rela-
tivistically covariant description of a physical phenomenon is open to suspicion that
the phenomenon is nonrelativistic (incompatible with the relativity theory). The
physical phenomenon is relativistic, if the vector lk is ﬁctitious in the given de-
scription. On the contrary, the physical phenomenon is nonrelativistic, because its
description contains two space-time invariants t and r. The relativistically covariant
description is not used practically for description of nonrelativistic phenomena, and
most researchers are convinced, that any relativistically covariant description is a
description of a relativistic phenomenon.

The considered example shows that nonrelativistic equation (3.5) can be written
in a relativistically covariant form (3.2), provided one introduces an absolute object
li, describing space-time splitting.

Dirac matrices γk are absolute objects, as well as the metric tensor gkl, which
may be considered as a derivative absolute object determined by the relation (1.2).
It follows from the relation (1.2) that the γ-matrices are to be transformed as 4-
vectors at the linear transformations of the space-time coordinates x, because the
rhs of (1.2) is a tensor at the linear transformations of coordinates x. Although at
the Lorentz transformation rhs of (1.2) is an invariant, we cannot suppose that γi
may be invariants, because γi cannot be invariants under linear transformations of
coordinates.

There are two approaches to the Dirac equation. In the ﬁrst approach [11, 12]
the wave function ψ is considered to be a scalar function deﬁned on the ﬁeld of
Cliﬀord numbers γl,

ψ = ψ(x, γ)Γ,

¯ψ = Γ¯ψ(x, γ),

(3.7)

where Γ is a constant nilpotent factor which has the property ΓF (γ)Γ = aΓ. Here
F (γ) is arbitrary function of γl and a is a complex number, depending on the form of
the function F . Within such an approach ψ, ¯ψ are transformed as scalars under the
Lorentz transformations, whereas γl are transformed as components of a 4-vector.
In this case the symmetry group of γl is a subgroup of the Lorentz group, and
SD is a
nonrelativistic dynamic system. Then the matrix vector γl describes some preferred
direction in the space-time.

In the second (conventional) approach ψ is considered to be a spinor, and γl,
l = 0, 1, 2, 3 are scalars with respect to the transformations of the Lorentz group. In
this case the symmetry group of the absolute objects γl is the Lorentz group, and
SD is considered to be a relativistic dynamic system.
dynamic system
Of course, the approaches leading to incompatible conclusions cannot be both
valid. At least, one of them is wrong. Analyzing the two approaches, Sommerfeld

10

[12] considered the ﬁrst approach to be more reasonable.
In the second case the
analysis is rather diﬃcult due to non-standard transformations of γl and ψ under
linear coordinate transformations T . Indeed, the transformation T for the vector
jl = ¯ψγlψ has the form

∂ ˜xl
∂xs
where the quantities marked by tilde mean the quantities in the transformed coor-
dinate system. This transformation can be carried out by two diﬀerent ways

˜ψ˜γl ˜ψ =

¯ψγsψ,

(3.8)

1 :

˜ψ = ψ,

˜ψ = ψ,

l = 0, 1, 2, 3

(3.9)

2 :

˜γl = γl,

l = 0, 1, 2, 3,

˜ψ = ψS−

1(γ, T ),

The relations (3.9) correspond to the ﬁrst approach and the relations (3.10) cor-
respond to the second one. Both ways (3.9) and (3.10) lead to the same result,
provided

˜γl =

∂ ˜xl
∂xs γs,
˜ψ = S(γ, T )ψ,

S∗(γ, T )γ0 = γ0S−

(cid:17)

The second way (3.10) has two defects. First, the transformation law of ψ depends
on γ, i.e. under linear transformation T of coordinates the components of ψ are
transformed through ψ and γl, but not only through ψ. Note that the tensor com-
ponents in a coordinate system are transformed only through the tensor components
in other coordinate system, and this transformation does not contain any absolute
objects. (for instance, the relation (3.8)). Second, the relation (3.12) is compatible
with (1.2) only under transformations T between orthogonal coordinate systems,
when components glk =
of the metric tensor are invariant. Indeed,
lhs of the relation (1.2) is a scalar under any linear coordinate transformations,
whereas rhs of (1.2) is invariant only under orthogonal (Lorentz) transformations.
Rhs of the relation (1.2) is transformed as a tensor under linear coordinate transfor-
mations. In other words, at the second approach the relation (1.2) is not covariant,
in general, with respect to arbitrary linear transformations of coordinates. In this
case one cannot be sure that the symmetry group of the dynamic system coincides
with the symmetry group of absolute objects.

The fact that the symmetry group of the dynamic system coincides with the
symmetry group of absolute objects was derived with the supposition, that under
the coordinate transformation any object is transformed only via its components.

(3.12)

(3.13)

This condition is violated in the second case, and one cannot be sure that the
symmetry group of dynamic system coincides with that of absolute objects.

After change of variables the action (1.1) is transformed to the form (2.8) –
(2.11), the γ-matrices being eliminated. But after reduction of the action to the
relativistically covariant form two new absolute objects appear: constant 4-vector
f k and constant 4-pseudovector zi. The 4-pseudovector zi appears to be ﬁctitious.
But the action depends really on 4-vector f k, which resembles the vector lk in the
considered example (3.2). It means that the dynamic system
SD is nonrelativistic,
because it supposes an absolute separation of the space-time into the space and the
time.

4 Modiﬁcation of the classical Dirac particle

Not all terms in the action (2.27) – (2.30) contain absolute objects f k and zk. Two
ﬁrst terms of (2.28) and the term (2.29) do not contain absolute objects. It means
SD is described partly relativistically and partly nonrelativis-
that the Dirac particle
tically. To determine what is described relativistically, it is useful to investigate the
classical Dirac particle
SDcl, which is a discrete dynamic system, i.e. the dynamic
system having a ﬁnite number of the freedom degrees. The classical Dirac particle
SD by means of the relativistic pro-
SDcl is determined uniquely by the Dirac particle
cedure (1.5). Investigating the classical Dirac particle
SDcl, we can determine which
degrees of freedom are described nonrelativistically and correct the nonrelativistic
description.

After dynamic disquantization (1.5) of the action (2.8) we obtain the action for

Here ξ0 is arbitrary and ﬁctitious. The 4-vector zk appears to be also ﬁctitious (see
Appendix B of this paper or of the paper [9]). But the 4-vector f k is not ﬁctitious.
The action (4.2) is invariant with respect to a change of independent variable τ 0

τ 0 →

˜τ 0 = F (τ 0)

√ ˙xs ˙xs = 1

where F is an arbitrary monotone function. The variable τ 0 may be chosen in such
a way that

for all values of the independent variable τ 0. Formally the expression (4.6) appears
to be an integral of dynamic equations generated by the action (4.2).

The ﬁrst term in (4.2) is described relativistically, because it does not contain
the absolute object f k. This term describes the translation degrees of freedom. Two
last terms contain the absolute object f k. They describe internal degrees of freedom.
Description of internal degrees of freedom appears to be nonrelativistic.

If we set ¯h = 0 in the action (4.2), we suppress internal degrees of freedom of the
classical Dirac particle, and description of
SDcl becomes relativistical. The classical
Dirac particle becomes relativistic, provided the absolute object f k is changed by
the dynamical variables. For instance, we may identify the unit timelike 4-vector
f k with the constant energy-momentum vector pk, normalized in a proper way. At
such a change the classical Dirac particle
SDcl turns into the modiﬁed classical Dirac
particle

SmDcl.

5 Discussion

Almost eighty years since its appearance the Dirac equation exempliﬁed the most
useful relativistic dynamic equation. Hyperﬁne structure of the hydrogen spectrum
has been explained by means of the Dirac equation. The quantum electrodynamics
is based on the Dirac equation. How can the newly discovered internal degrees of
freedom of the Dirac particle inﬂuence on these well established results?

Only internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle are described incorrectly
(nonrelativistically), whereas the translation degrees of freedom are described cor-
rectly (relativistically). Energetic levels, connected with the internal degrees of free-
dom are very high. They are not excited at the processes, which are considered in
the quantum electrodynamics and in the theory of atomic spectra. In these physical
processes one may ignore the internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle. Thus,
the correct description of the internal degrees of freedom does not change anything
in the quantum electrodynamics and in the theory of atomic spectra. However, in
the theory of the elementary particles, where there are high energetic processes, we
should take into account the internal degrees of freedom of the Dirac particle. We
are to describe them relativistically.

We have produced the minimal modiﬁcation of the classical Dirac particle

SDcl,
SD remains to be not completely relativis-
but the description of the Dirac particle
tic. This defect should be eliminated also. We can make this, adding the eliminated
”quantum” terms with transversal derivatives to the action for the statistical en-
SmDcl. This procedure is
semble
not unique. Besides, we cannot be sure, that the dynamic equations in terms of the
wave function appear to be linear.

SmDcl] of the modiﬁed classical Dirac particles
[

E

Since 1925, when the Dirac equation has been invented, it was considered to
be the completely relativistic equation, describing the particles of spin 1/2 in the
best way. Why was not the incompleteness of its relativity discovered earlier? This
question is very important for the correct evaluation of the microcosm investigation
strategy. The answer is rather unexpected. The nonrelativistic features of the
Dirac equation was discovered in 1995 [14, 15], as soon as the Dirac particle became
to be investigated simply as a dynamic system (but not as the quantum dynamic
system). The quantum dynamic system distinguishes from the usual dynamic system
in its compatibility with the quantum principles. The quantum principles restrict
the way of description of the dynamic system. They demand that the quantum
dynamic system be described in terms of the world function and dynamic equations
be linear in these terms. The quantum principles admit only linear transformation
of dependent variables (wave function).

The quantum principles impose the constraints on the description of a quantum
dynamic system and cumber its investigation. They do not admit to eliminate γ-
matrices, what is necessary for discovery of the dynamic equation incompatibility
with the principles of relativity.

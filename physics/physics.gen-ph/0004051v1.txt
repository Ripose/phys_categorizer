Abstract

It is proved in the manuscript that as long as the proper coordinate transformation is intro-
duced, the equations of geodetic lines described in curved space-time can be transformed into
the dynamic equations in ﬂat space-time. That is to say, the Einstain theory of gravity and
other gravitational theories based on the curved space-time can be identically transformed into
ﬂat space-time to describe. As an example, the Schwarzschild solution of the spherical symmetry
gravitational ﬁeld is transformed into ﬂat space-time to study. The results show that there exists
no any singularity in the all processes and the whole space-time including at the point r=0. So it
seems more rational to discuss the problems of gravitation in ﬂat space-time.

Introduction

The general theory of relativity based on the curved space-time has got great success and becomes
main current theory now. However, there still exist some foundational problems in it just as the
deﬁnition of gravitational ﬁeld’s energy, the quantization of gravitation and the problem of singularity
and so on. So it is always an attractive idea to re-establish gravitational theory in ﬂat space-time.
Since the 1940’s, many theories based on ﬂat space-time were put forward. Though all of those theories
are coincident with the gravitational theory of Einstain under the conditions of weak ﬁelds, it can not
be proved that they are better than the theory of Einstain by experiments at present. So according
to the current viewpoint, the space-time of gravitation ﬁeld should be non-Euclidean one. The ﬂat
space-time is always regarded as the boundary condition where the gravitational ﬁeld is far away.

In the paper, the author does not try to establish an independent theory in ﬂat space-time. But it
can be proved that as long as the proper coordinate transformations are introduced and, the equations
of geodetic lines in curved space-time can be transformed into the dynamic equations in ﬂat space-time.
It means that the Einstein’s theory of gravitation and other theories based on the curved space-time
can also be identically transformed into the ﬂat space-time to describe. Then, the method is used
to discuss the Schwarzschild solution of the spherical symmetry gravitational ﬁeld. The results show
that there exists no any singularity again in the all processes and the whole space-time including the
point . So it seams more rational to discuss gravitational problems in the ﬂat space-time.

The paper includes three chapters. The ﬁrst chapter discusses how to transform the Schwarzschild
solution of Einstein’s theory in the spherical symmetry gravitation ﬁeld into the dynamic equations
in ﬂat space-time. The second chapter provides a general proof to transform all gravitational theories
based on curved space-time into the theories based on ﬂat space-time. The third chapter discusses
some problems of foundational concepts, for example, weather space-time is curved or not when exit
gravitational ﬁelds exist.

1. The Transformation of the Schwarzschild Solution

In the formula, we take α = 2GM/c2 . Let θ = π/2 and put Eq.(1) into the geodetic line equation,
according to the familiar results in the general theory of relativity, we have the integrals

Here L is the angel momentum of unit mass. Eq.(7) is just the conservation formula of angel momen-

It should be noted that each quantity in Eq.(10) is deﬁned in caved space-time. In order to express
the equation in ﬂat space-time, the further transformation is needed. Let r0, ϕ0 and t0 represent the
space-time coordinates in ﬂat space-time, because of the invariability of the 4-diamention interval ds2
, we have

ds2 = c2dt2

Combining Eq.(7)with (10) and let r0 → rthe results of the Einstein’s theory can be expressed in the
similar formula of the Newtonian gravitation in ﬂat space-time

The formula can describe the perihelion precession of the Mercury.

On the other hand, We have used the eigen time τ in Eq.(16). It can be proved that the eﬀect of
special relativity has been considered in the formula. The square of a particle’s speed in the center
gravitational ﬁeld is

V 2 = V 2

Here m is the mass of particle, and dτ is determined by Eq.(15). Because of ~L → ~V × ~r, it can be
seen that there exist the extra two items relative to V 2/c2 comparing with The Newtonian theory.
The problem of energy conservation is discussed below. For simpliﬁcation, we only discuss the
situation with L = 0 . In this case, the particle moves along the radium direction. By using Eq.(20),
Eq.(22) becomes

The motion equation of photon in the center gravitational ﬁeld is discussed as follows. For
photons,ds = 0 so ds can not be used as the parameter of the equation of geodetic line.
In this
case, we take dτ to replace ds and get the same results by solving the equations of gravitational ﬁeld

(39)

It is obvious that V 6= constant, so the speed of light would change with r in gravitational ﬁeld. Then
let’s discuss how to transform the results into the ﬂat reference system. For light’s motion, if we write
the metric in the ﬂat reference system as

ds2 = c2dt2

0 − dr2

0 − dr2

0 − r2

0dϕ2

0 = 0

(40)

the result shows that light move in a uniform speed c in the gravitational ﬁeld. However, this is
improper for it contradicts Eq.(39). Suppose light’s speed is V0 in the ﬂat space-time, the metric
should be written as

From Eq.(34) and (41)we have

There exists one degree of freedom to choose the relations between t0 and t here. If taking t0 = t, we

αL2

(45)

Comparing Eq.(45) with Eq.(39) we obtain V0 = V , that is to say, the speeds of lights are the
same in the both curved and ﬂat space-times. Therefore, by the relation α = dV0/dt0 = dV /dt, the
accelerations and forces are the same, so that the forms of motion equations are also the same. So
by connecting Eq.(32) with (37), we can directly write the motion equation of photons in the vector’s
form in ﬂat space-time as

The formula can be used to describe the deviation of light in the solar gravitational ﬁeld. As for the
time delay experiments of radar waves in the solar gravitational ﬁeld, by considering t0 = t in Eq.(38)
under the condition of week ﬁeld, we can get

cdt0 = (1 +

Suppose radar waves just swept over the surface of the sun with the radium r0 and the speed of radar
waves is the speed of light in vacuum, we have L = cr0 in the light of angular conservation. The
integral of Eq.(48) is

r0
The same result can be reached from the formula (2) .

ct0 =qr2 − r2

0 + αlnpr2 − r2

0 + r

− αpr2 − r2

(49)

However, it can be seen from Eq.(38) that the photon would move in the speed over light’ speed in
vacuum when L = 0 and r < α/2. This is unacceptable (The problem will be discussed again later.).
So we re-deﬁne the transform relations between t0 , t and τ as

Put it into Eq.(36), we have

dt0 = (1 −

(50)

(51)

From the formula, Eq.(49) can also be reached under the condition of weak ﬁeld. It is obvious that
Eq.(50) is the simplest form to obtain the formula (49).from (36). In this way, we have

V0 = cr1 +

αL2
c2r3 (1 +

α

)−1

(52)

Because ~L = ~V0 ×~r ,when r → 0 , V0 → 0 , there is no the motion of over light’s speed again according
to Eq.(52).
It should be noted that Eq.46is not the dynamic equation of the photon in the gravitational ﬁeld.
Because when L = 0 , d2~r/dτ 2 = 0 , it seems that the photon is not acted by force. However, the
photon has acceleration in the gravitational ﬁeld. So there should be a force acting on the photon.
Therefore, Eq.46can only be regarded as the equation of kinematics from which the velocity and
acceleration of the phone can be obtained. But it can not be regarded as the equation of dynamics of
the photon from which the force can be obtained.

Now let’s discuss how to obtain the dynamic equation of the photon based on Eq.(46). Let photon’s
speed V0 → V (as well as r0 → r , t0 → t ) , when r → ∞, V → c . When r < ∞ , V < c , showing
In order to obtain the dynamic
that the photon is acted by repulsion and does retarded motion.
equation of photon in the gravitational ﬁeld, we suppose to have an imaginary particle with speed ~V ′
and

~V ′ = ~c − ~V

(53)

Here V is the speed of photon in the gravitational ﬁeld, c is the speed of photon in vacuum. The
directions of V and c are supposed always the same. When photon’s initial speed V = c , the speed
of imaginary particle is V ′ = 0 . When the photon falls down in the gravitational ﬁeld with V < c
, we have V ′ > 0 . When V = 0 , we have V ′ = c . So it is obvious that the imaginary particle
does acceleration motion in the gravitational ﬁeld similar to the general particles with static masses.
Therefore, the force acted on the imaginary particle in the gravitational ﬁeld of spherical symmetry
can be supposed to be

Here m is the static mass of the imaginary particle. The dynamic equation of imaginary particle is

On the other hand, similar to the particles with static masses, the relativity momentum of a photon
in the gravitational ﬁeld can be deﬁned as

~p =

R

(56)

Here m is so-called photon’s static mass and R = R(r, θ) is the function remained to be decided.
Then, we deﬁne the imaginary particle’s momentum ~p′ as

~p′ = ~pc − ~p = m~c −

(57)

Here ~pc is photon’s momentum in vacuum. Put Eq.(57) into Eq.(55), we get the dynamic equation of

However, it can be seen that it is actually unnecessary for us to introduce imaginary particle. In
fact, we can directly suppose that the dynamic equation of photon in the central gravitational ﬁeld
is just Eq.(58), so long as from it we can reach the identical results comparing with the Einstein’s
theory. The concrete form of function R is discussed as follows. We have from Eq.(56)

(67)

Here x = α/r When x → , R = 1the integral constant C can be determined.
After the function R is determined by the method above, Eq.(58) can be regarded as the dynamic
equation of photon in the gravitational ﬁeld of spherical symmetry in ﬂat space-time. It coincides
with the results of the Einstein’s theory and can be used to explain the deviation of light as well as
the time delay experiments of radar waves in the solar gravitational ﬁeld. Besides, Eq.(58) can also be
used to explain the gravitational red shift of spectral line. Let’s ﬁrst establish the energy conservation
equation of photon in the gravitational ﬁeld. Similar to Eq.(24), we multiply d~r on the two sides of
Eq.(58) and take the integral

Here C is a constant. If we choose another proper constant b and let V0 represent the light’s frequency

photon can be deﬁned as

T (r) = K(r) + mc2(1 −

(75)

In this way, when L = 0 , the formula of energy conservation of photon in the gravitational ﬁeld of

On the other hand, in the general theory of relativity, the red shift of spectral line is considered
caused by time delay of gravitational ﬁeld.
In the gravitational theory of curved space-time, the
photon is actually considered to be free one and moves along the curved geodetic line without potential
energy or no force acted on it. Therefore, the total energy of a photon is equal to its kinetic energy
in the gravitational ﬁeld. But if the formula E = hv is considered tenable in any point in the
gravitational ﬁeld, because is a variable, is also a variable, that is to say, that the energy of photon in
the gravitational ﬁeld is not conservative. This is just the price we have to pay in the gravitational
theory based on the curved space-time to explain the red shift of spectral line, thought now people
seem to avoid this problem. However, this is unacceptable when we describer gravitational force in
ﬂat space-time. In order to keep energy conservation for photon in the description of ﬂat space-time,
the rational way is to suppose that the frequency of photon is only relative to its kinetic energy, and
has nothing to do with its potential energy with T = hv . Here v is the frequency of photon in
the point in the ﬁeld. So the formula of energy conservation of photon in the gravitational ﬁeld is
hv + U (r) = hv0 = mc2 . In this way, the formula of red shift becomes

(79)

The both are the same. But in the strong ﬁeld, they are not the same, especially when α > r, Eq.(79)
becomes meaningless, but Eq.(77)is still meaningful. In fact Eq.(77) can be used to explain the big red
shifts of the quasi-stellar objects. Taking α/r = 7.5, we have the red shift value Z = − △ v/v0 = 2.47
. Suppose the mass of the quasi-stellar object is 1040Kg, it can be calculated that the radium of he
quasi-stellar object is r = 1.98× 1012m and its mean density is ρ = 3.08× 102Kg/m3 . It is only 0.22
times comparing with the mean density of the sun with ρ = 1.40 × 103Kg/m3 . Taking α/r = 12 we
have Z = 3.42 , r = 1.24 × 1012m , ρ = 1.26 × 102Kg/m3 . The even density is similar to the sun’s
density. According to the general theory of relativity, if α/r > 1 r is in the inside of black hole. But
according to Eq.(77), only when r → 0 , we have inﬁnite red shift with Z → ∞ . For the common
stars, r 6= 0 so according to Eq.(77), the black holes do not exist actually.
What is mainly shown above is that the results are the same under the condition of weak ﬁeld
when the gravitational theory is described in the both ﬂat and curved space-time. Besides the red
shift of spectral line, the following discussion will further show their diﬀerences in the strong ﬁelds
owing to the fact that the coordinate times are diﬀerent in the both situations. We also only discuss
particle’s motions along the radial direction of the spherical symmetry gravitational ﬁeld with L = 0
. For a particle with static mass, when L = 0 , the speed is from Eq.(9) and (5)

(80)

In the formula it has been supposed that V = 0 when r → ∞ . Deﬁnite the direction of velocity is

when the particle falls down the gravitational ﬁeld. The acceleration is

(82)

(82) Because t > 0 the negative sign is taken when a particle falls down along the direction of radius
vector. Conversely, it takes positive sign.

Let’s ﬁrst discuss the particle’s motion in the area r ≥ α . When , r > a, V is a negative number.
When r = α , V = 0 the particle arrives at the Schwarzschild event horizon. It can be known from
Eq.(81) that when r = 3α and r = α , acceleration becomes zero. When r > 3α ,α < 0 the particle is
acted by gravitation and is accelerated downward. When α < r < 3α , α > 0 , the particle is acted
by repulsive force and is retarded Gravitation becomes repulsion, it seems unimaginable..When r = α
, the particle is not acted by force and at rest on the surface of event horizon. It can be known from
Eq.(82) that when r = α , t = ∞ , that is to say, it takes the particle an inﬁnite time to reach the
event horizon.
It can be known
from Eq.(82) that the time has no deﬁnition inside the event horizon because the logarithm of a
negative number has no deﬁnition(At present, some peasants think that it means space and time
to be exchanged each other in the black holes. This is absurd. How one dimension’s time can be
transformed into three dimension’s space?). So speaking strictly, it is meaningless to talk about
particle’s speed, acceleration and motion in the area r < α . If this problem is neglected temporary,
we can write Eq.(80)as

Then let’s discuss the particle’s motion beneath the event horizon r < α .

V = ±cr α

r

(1 −

α
r

) + V0

(83)

When r = α , V = 0 so V0 = 0 . Therefore, the velocity and acceleration can still be expressed
by Eq.(80) and (81). It is obvious that we have α < 0 inside the event horizon, meaning that the
particles only acted by gravitation. Suppose a particle at the point r has a velocity upward, it would
be retarded until a = V = 0 when it arrives at the event horizon and stays there at last. If a particle
has a velocity downward, is would be accelerated and reach light’s speed at a certain place. After
that, the particle would move in the speed over light’s speed and reaches an inﬁnite speed at the point
r = 0. The results is the same as that analyzed in the current theory using the method of light cone,
except that the particle’s speed would be over light’s speed.

As for a photon’s motion, when L = 0, from Eq.(38) we have

V =

= ±c(1 −

α =

Let r = r0 when t = 0 , we have integral from Eq.(84)

ct = ±(r − r0 + αln

r − α

)

(84)

(85)

(86)

When a photon falls down in the area r > α , because α > 0 they are retarded by repulsion. When
the photon arrives at the event horizon r = α , the speeds and accelerations are equal to zero and
the inﬁnite time is need. In the area r < α , time has no deﬁnition for the same reason. Despite of
this problem, we have α < 0 in the area r < α. Suppose a photon has a velocity upwards inside the
event horizon, it would be retarded by gravitation and has α = V = 0 when it arrives at the surface
of event horizon. If the photon has a velocity downwards, it would be accelerated. When it arrives at
the point r = α/2 , its speed would reach light’s speed in vacuum again. After that time, the photon
would move in the speed over light’s speed in vacuum. When the photon arrives at the point r = 0 ,
its speed becomes inﬁnite (3).

10

It is obvious that there exist some things irrational, especially particles would move in the speeds
over light’s speed in vacuum. In fact in the current theory of black holes, the motions with the speeds
over light’s speed can not be avoided during the processes in which material collapses toward the
center singularities of gravitational ﬁelds. At present, those problems are attributed to the improper
selections of coordinates.
In order to eliminate those defects, people now transform the problems
into other coordinate systems to discuss, for example, the Eddington and the Kruskal coordinate
system. In the new coordinate system, though the singularities on the surfaces of event horizons can
be eliminated, they can not yet be eliminated at the point r = 0. Hawking even proved that it was
impossible to eliminate all singularities in the general theory of relativity (3).

Now let’s discuss the problems in ﬂat space-time. When t0 = 0 let r = r0 . According to Eq.(19),

when a particle falls free down the gravitational ﬁeld, we have

(88)

(89)

It is obvious that every thing is normal in the area r > α . The particle is monotonously accelerated
by gravitation. There is no any singularity in the whole space-time and in all physical quantities.
When the particle arrives at the point r = 0 , we have

V = − lim

(91)

It can be seen that the particle’s speed tends to light’s speed but can not yet reach it. Besides,
acceleration and time are ﬁnite. When a particle moves along the positive direction of radius vector,
as long as it has a speed at the point r

V ≥ cr α

the particle can escape the gravitational ﬁeld and has a speed V ≥ 0 when it reach the point r → ∞ .
As for a photon, when it falls down the gravitational ﬁeld in ﬂat space-time, according to Eq.(51),
its velocity and acceleration are

It can be seen that the photon is acted by repulsion and dose the retarded motion. When t = 0 let
r = r0 ,we have

There is no any singularity in the area r > α . When the photon arrives at the point r = 0, its speed
V = 0 acceleration is also ﬁnite

Therefore after the Schwazschild solution is transformed into ﬂat space-time to describe, all orig-
inal singularities disappear (In ﬂat space-time, singularity appears in the form of over light speed’s
motion.). So it is obvious that the singularities in the general theory of relativity are actually caused
by describing the theory in the curved space-time. The gravitational ﬁeld itself has no singularities.
Meanwhile, it is known a photon can escape from the gravitational ﬁeld when it moves along the
direction of radius by the action of repulsion as long as it is not at the point r = 0 . In this way, the
black holes, at least the singular black holes with inﬁnite densities and inﬁnite small volumes, do not
exist.

If observers are in the reference system which falls free down the gravitational ﬁeld, in this case,
the time is τ and the distance between the observers and the center mass is r according to Eq.9, we
have

They are just the results of the Newtonian gravitational theory. There are no singularities when r > 0
. But when r < GM/c2r , the relative speed is over light’s speed. When r → 0 , the relative speed
becomes inﬁnite. So the reference system falling free down the gravitational ﬁeld is not yet a good
reference system for the discussion of gravitational problems. The reason will be discuss in the third
chapter.

In brief, at least for the spherical symmetry gravitational ﬁeld, it is more rational to study grav-
itational problems in ﬂat space-time than in curved space-time. By transforming the solution of
gravitational ﬁeld equation to discuss in ﬂat space-time, the problems can become more rational and
simple. Some puzzling problems just as the singularity problems of black holes, the ﬂat problem of
the universal early stage and so on would be expounded. So it is necessary for us to re-examine the
conclusions of the current general relativity by transforming them into ﬂat space-time to study in
order to get more rational results.

2. The transformations in the general situations

Now let’s generally prove that it is possible to transform the gravitational theories described in
the curved space-time into in the ﬂat space-time. In the following discussion, the indexes of Egyptian
letters are used to represent the 4-diamention quantities and the indexes of Latin letters represent the
3-diamention quantities. Let xα represent the 4-diamention coordinates in curved space-time and xα
0
represent the 4-diamention coordinates in ﬂat space-time. The 4-diamention linear elements in both
space-times are individually

(101)

In the formulas, x0 and x0
in a gravitational ﬁeld is

d2xα
ds2 + Γα

βσ

dxβ

= 0

(102)

For a certain gravitational ﬁeld, suppose the metric tensor gαβ has been obtained by solving the
Einstein’s equation of gravitation ﬁeld or other equations based on curved space-time, we can get
from the integrals of Eq.(102)

as well as

xi = xi(s)

x0 = x0(s)

12

(103)

(104)

From Eq.(104), we can obtain

Put it into Eq.(103), we get

s = s(x0)

xi(s(x0)) = xi(x0) = xi(t)

The particle’s velocity and acceleration are

dxi(t)

dt

= V i(t)

d2xi(t)
dt2 =

dV i(t)

dt

= αi(t)

(105)

(106)

(107)

(108)

In addition, two independent equations can be obtained by eliminating time t in the three equations
of (106)

φ1(x1, x2) = 0

(109)
If xi are the coordinates in the Euclidean space, φ1 and φ2 represent the equations of two columnar
surfaces with the axial lines meeting at right angles. The intersecting line of the two columnar surfaces
determined by Eq.(109) presents the orbit of a particle moving in the 3-dimention Euclidean space. If
xi are the non-Euclidean space coordinates, φ1 and φ2 represent the two 2-dimention curved surface
equations in the non-Euclidean space. Their intersecting line also represents the orbit of a particle
moving in the 3-dimention non-Euclidean space

φ2(x1, x3) = 0

On the other hand, as we know, any point on the 2-diamention non-Euclidean curved surface can
ﬁnd a one-to-one point in the 3-diamention Euclidean space, that is to say, the 2-dimention non-
Euclidean curved surface can be inlaid into the 3-dimention Euclidean space. Therefore, any point at
the interesting line of the two 2-dimention non-Euclidean curved surfaces can also ﬁnd a one-to-one
point in the 3-diamention ﬂat Euclidean space. So we have the transformation relation between the
points of geodetic line in the non-Euclidean space and the points in the Euclidean space

xi = xi(xj
0)

or

xi
0 = xi

0(xj)

(110)

In order to get transformation relation between time t and t0 , by the condition ds2 = constant , we
have

or

ds2 = (dx0

0)2 − dxi

0dxi

0 = g00(dx0)2 − 2goidx0dxi − gijdxidxj

c2dt2

0 = c2g00dt2 − 2cg0idtdxi − gijdxidxj + dxi

0dxi
0

(111)

(112)

By considering Eq.(106) and (110), each item on the right side of Eq.(112) can be expressed as the
function of time t, so we get transformation relation of time

i.e.,

t0 =Z rg00 − 2g0i

t0 = t0(t)

or

t = t(t0)

(113)

(114)

After the transformation relations of space-time coordinates are obtained, the equation (107) in the
non-Euclidean space can be transformed into that in the Euclidean space. From Eq.(107),(110) and
(114), we have

∂xi

Put Eq.116and117into Eq.(119), we get the dynamic equation and force of the particle in the gravi-
tational ﬁeld in ﬂat space. In general, they are diﬀerent from the Newtonian theory.

As for photon, we can obtain the corresponding equations (116) and (117) from its geometric
equation in curved space, then deﬁne photon’s momentum in the same form of Eq.(56). After that,
the dynamic equation of photon can be established in ﬂat space-time. But it is unnecessary for us to
discuss it nay more here. In this way, we have achieved the transformation of gravitation’s descriptions
from curved space-time to ﬂat space-time.

In the same, the gravitation’s descriptions can also be transformed from ﬂat space-time into curved

space-time. From Eq.(119) in ﬂat space-time, we can get by solving the equation

(135)

So the metric tensors can be determined by Eq.(134) and (135). It is noted that if Eq.(121) is put
into Eq.(101) directly, we have

ds2 = g ′

αβdxαdxβ

(136)

136 The metric tensor gαβ is diﬀerent from that shown in Eq.(135) in general. The metric tensor g ′
αβ
shown in Eq.(136) is the Euclidean metric in essence for it can return to the original form Eq.(101)
by an inverse transformation. But the metric tensor gαβ determined by Eq.(134) and (135) can not
in general, so they are the non-Euclidean metrics in general.

Up to now we have achieved the transformation of gravitation’s descriptions between the curved
space-time and the ﬂat space-time, and proved their equivalence. The diﬀerence is that in curved
space-time particles move along the geodetic lines without forces acting on them, but in ﬂat space-
time particles move along the non-geodetic lines acted by gravitation. What kinds of descriptive forms
are taken depends on convenience in principle, but as shown above, the practical results should be
considered.

3. Discussions on some foundational concepts

1. Is the space-time curved or ﬂat after all when gravitational ﬁeld exists?
This is ﬁrst a problem of measurement. Whether can we answer this problem by the direct
measurement? The answer is negative. Even thought the space-time is curved when the gravitational
ﬁeld exists, we can not detect it by the direct measurement. This is owing to the fact that before
the measurement we have to deﬁne standard ruler and clock. But only in ﬂat space-time, we can do
them. In curved space-time, we have no deﬁnitions of standard ruler and clock. When the ruler and

15

clock deﬁned in ﬂat space-time are put into gravitational ﬁelds, they would change or become curved
synchronously with the ﬁelds, so that the measurements can not show the changes of curved level of
space-time. The ruler and clock in the gravitational ﬁelds can not free themselves from the eﬀects of
gravitational ﬁelds, so it is impossible to show whether space-time is curved or ﬂat when gravitational
ﬁeld exists by the direct measurement.

What we can do is to use indirect methods, for example, to observe the orbits of test particles orbit
or the red shifts of spectral lines in the gravitational ﬁelds to decide the curved level of space-time.
However, as shown above, we can describe the orbit of test particle in gravitational ﬁeld by either
geometric equation in curved space-time, or the dynamic equation in ﬂat space-time. We can also
explain the red shifts of spectral lines in the gravitational ﬁelds as the results of time delay or the
potential energy’s changes. Two methods are equal to each other. So it is obvious that space-time
itself can not be designated as curved or ﬂat actually. The reality is what kind of reference systems,
curved or ﬂat, we choose to describe it. If the curved reference system is chosen, the space-time is
curved. If the ﬂat reference system is chosen, the pace-time becomes ﬂat. It is meaningless to talk
about space-time itself curved or ﬂat. So we should only use the concept of curved or ﬂat reference
system, in spite of the concept of curved or ﬂat space-time.

2. The equivalent principle
According to the weak equivalent principle, gravitational mass and inertial mass are equivalent to

each other. Let m represent static mass, represent inertial motion mass, we have

m1 =

m

p1 − V 2/c2

(137)

Let mG represent gravitational mass, comparing Eq.(22) with the Newtonian formula of gravitation
and considering the relation ~L = ~V × ~r , we get
mG = mr1 −

3(~V × ~n)2

V 2
c2 [1 +

Here ~n is the unit radius vector. It is obvious m1 6= mG in general situations. Only when V = 0 ,
they are equal to each other. In fact, all completed Eotvos experiments only prove that gravitational
mass and inertial mass are equal to each other when the testing bodies on the two ends of cantilever
beam are at rest each other(4). It has not yet be proved that they are equivalent when there exists
relative motion between them. It should be noted that the formula (138) is the result of Einstein’s
ﬁeld equation, showing that gravitational mass and inertial mass are not equivalent actually when the
factor of speed is considered.

3. The principle of general relativity
The paper’s conclusions are completely based on the Einstein equation of gravitational ﬁeld, no
any new hypothesis is introduced besides transforming the theory to the ﬂat reference system to
discuss. According to the general theory of relativity, it is equivalent to discuss physical problems in
any reference system in nature. No one is more superior. Since we can discuss gravitational problems
in any reference system, we can also discuss them in ﬂat reference system. However, the results show
that ﬂat reference system seems more superior for the discussion of gravitational problems. The results
contradict the principle of general relativity. So we have to discuss this problem further.

Einstein established special relativity that denied the existence of absolutely static reference sys-
tem. Later, he put forwards the principle of general relativity trying to cancel the superior position
of the inertial reference systems. If we consider the principle of general relativity as that the motion
equations are covariant, or the basic forms of the motion equations are the same in any reference sys-
tem, the principle is all right. However, it does not mean that the concrete forms of motion equations
and their solutions are the same. In special relativity, the 4-diamention coordinate transformation
means that the relative speed is introduced. Let pµ represents the 4-diamention momentum, Fµ rep-
resents the 4-diamention force. The basic form of motion equation dpµ/dt = Fµ is unchanged when
an inertial reference system is transformed into another inertial reference system moving in a uniform

16

speed.. But the concrete forms of the 4-diamention force Fµ and particle’s motion, as well as and some
physical quantities would change. For example, length constrict, time delay, moving mass increasing
and the form of force changing and so on, though according to special relativity, these changes only
have relative meanings.

In general relativity, the coordinate transformations involve more problems. At present, it is
considered that a solution of gravitational ﬁeld equation can still represent the same ﬁeld after the
solution has been transformed into another new reference system. This conclusion is worthy of further
discussion and consideration. If the coordinate transformation is carried out in the 3-diamention space,
there is no any problem. But in the 4-diamention space-time, because time is involved, the situation
is completely diﬀerent. In the general theory of relativity, the 4-diamention coordinate transformation
means that acceleration or non-inertial reference system is introduced. According to the principle of
equivalence, non-inertial reference system is equal to gravitational ﬁeld. The transformation from one
non-inertial reference system to another means that a gravitational ﬁeld is changed to another. So the
coordinate transformations would change physical processes. Speaking clearly, for a gravitational ﬁeld
with a determinate form, suppose we have obtained the solution by solving the Einstein’s ﬁeld equation,
if the solution is transformed into another reference system, the form of the solution would change,
though the basic form of ﬁeld equation is unchanged.
In the light of the principle of equivalence,
it means that a new gravitational ﬁeld is introduced and the original solution loses its meaning.
Therefore, a determinate gravitational ﬁeld can only corresponds to a determinate metric, arbitrary
coordinate transformation is forbidden according to the principle of equivalence. Unless the same
results can be reached in new reference system for all problems, but this is impossible in general. For
example, we can not calculate the perihelion precession of Mercury and other experiments and get the
same results in the Edington or Kruskal coordinate systems. This is just the reason why the energy of
gravitational ﬁeld can not be deﬁned well in the current theory. For a deﬁnite gravitational ﬁeld with
a certain of symmetry, we can only deﬁne its energy in the deﬁnite metric with the same symmetry.
But it is allowed to transform the solutions into the inertial or ﬂat reference systems to discuss. In
this case, what is done is to transform the geodesic lines into the dynamic equations of gravitation
without any attached force being introduced. Or speaking more clearly, there exist no relativity and
arbitrariness in the description of gravitation. A certain of absoluteness is needed for us to describe
gravitation. We should establish a united standard for gravitation. Only based on the ﬂat reference
system, we can do it.

It can be seen from discussions above that though the Einstein’s theory of gravitation has obtained
great succession, there still exist some problems in its theoretical and logical foundation which need
to be cleared and reformed so that the theory can become more rational. It is obvious that we need
renewing some ideas about the essence of space-time and gravitation. The author will discuss them
in detail later.

ON THE ORIGIN OF THE DEFLECTION OF LIGHT

Abstract. Action at distance in Newtonian physics is replaced by
ﬁnite propagation speeds in classical post–Newtonian physics. As
a result, the diﬀerential equations of motion in Newtonian physics
are replaced by functional diﬀerential equations, where the delay
associated with the ﬁnite propagation speed is taken into account.
Newtonian equations of motion, with post–Newtonian corrections,
are often used to approximate the functional diﬀerential equations.
In [16] a simple atomic model based on a functional diﬀerential
equation which reproduces the quantized Bohr atomic model was
presented. The unique assumption was that the electrodynamic
interaction has a ﬁnite propagation speed. In [17] a simple grav-
itational model based on a functional diﬀerential equation which
gives a gravitational quantiﬁcation and an explanation of the mod-
iﬁed Titius–Bode law is described. In [18] an explanation of the
anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihelion is given in terms of
a simple retarded potential, which, at ﬁrst order, coincides with
Gerber’s potential of 1898, and which agrees with the author’s
previous works [16, 17]. In this paper, it is shown how the simple
retarded potential presented in [18] also gives the correct value of
the gravitational deﬂection of fast particles of General Relativity.

1. Introduction

At the conclusion of his treatise on Opticks [21] in 1704, Newton
proposed a certain number of queries “in order to a farther search to
be made by others”. The very ﬁrst of these queries was:

Do not Bodies act upon Light at a distance, and by their
action bend its Rays, and is not this action strongest at
the least distance?

Superﬁcially this may not seem like a very radical suggestion, because
on the basis of the corpuscular theory of light, and Newton’s laws of

mechanics and gravitation, it is easy to conjecture that a beam of
light might be slightly deﬂected as it passes near a large massive body,
assuming that particles of light respond to gravitational acceleration
similarly to particles of matter. Johann Georg von Soldner, in 1801,
calculated the bending of light rays grazing the Sun’s disk, also referred
to in [19], using classical mechanics and a hypothetical light velocity of
around 3 · 105 km per second. A hundred years later, Einstein repeated
the prediction (in the context of his theories) that starlight passing by
the Sun would be deﬂected by the Sun’s gravity, so that the apparent
distance between stars either side of the Sun when viewed during an
eclipse would be smaller. For a complete description of the historical
development of the problem see [20] and [26].

For any conical orbit of a small test particle of mass m in a Newtonian
gravitational ﬁeld around a central mass M, the eccentricity of the
unbounded hyperbolic orbit is given by

ε =

1 +

s

2EL2
G2m3M 2 ,

where E = mv2/2−GmM/r is the total energy (kinetic plus potential),
L = mrvt is the angular momentum, v is the total speed, vt is the
tangential component of the speed, and r is the radial distance from the
center of the mass. Since a beam of light travels at such a high speed, it
will be in a shallow hyperbolic orbit around an ordinary massive object
like the Sun.

Letting rp denote the closest approach (the perihelion) of the beam

to the gravitating body, at which v = vt, we have

As expected, the test particle mass m cancels out above. Now we set
vt = c (the speed of light) at the perihelion, and from the geometry of
the hyperbola we know that the asymptotes make an angle of β with
the axis of symmetry, where cos β = 1/ε.

As the hyperbolic orbit shown in Figure 1, the total angular deﬂec-
tion of the beam of light is δN = π − 2β, which for small angles β and
for M much less than rp, is given in Newtonian mechanics by

δN = π − 2 arccos

The best natural opportunity to observe this deﬂection would be to
look at the stars near the perimeter of the Sun during a solar eclipse.
The mass of the Sun in gravitational units is about M = 1475 meters,

hyperbolic orbit about the Sun. For deﬂection on grazing
incidence, the distance of closest approach is rp.

and a beam of light just skimming past the Sun would have a closest
distance equal to the Sun’s radius, rp = 6.95 · 108 meters. Therefore,
the Newtonian prediction would be 0.000004245 radians, which equals
0.875 seconds of arc.

The idea of bending light was revived in 1911 Einstein’s paper, see
[10]. He used the equivalence principle and the equivalent mass-energy
of a photon, together with Special Relativity, to predict that clocks
run at diﬀerent rates in a gravitational potential and the bending of
light-rays in a gravitational ﬁeld, even before he developed the concept
of curved-space time. Oddly enough, the quantitative prediction given
in this paper for the amount of deﬂection of light passing near a large
mass was more or less identical to the old Newtonian prediction 0.83
seconds of arc. It wasn’t until late in 1915, see [12], as he completed the
General Relativity theory, that Einstein realized his earlier prediction
was incorrect, and the angular deﬂection should actually be twice the
size he predicted in 1911. Only in this second calculation, published in
1916, where he included the eﬀect of space-time curvature, he obtained
a value δGR = 4GM/c2rp.

2. Deflection of the light from a retarded potential

Action at distance in Newtonian physics is replaced by ﬁnite prop-
agation speeds in classical post–Newtonian physics. As a result, the

4

J. GIN´E

diﬀerential equations of motion in Newtonian physics are replaced by
functional diﬀerential equations, where the delay associated with the
ﬁnite propagation speed is taken into account. Newtonian equations
of motion, with post–Newtonian corrections, are often used to approx-
imate the functional diﬀerential equations, see, for instance, [5, 6, 7, 8,
15, 24, 25]. In [16] a simple atomic model based on a functional dif-
ferential equation which reproduces the quantized Bohr atomic model
was presented. The unique assumption was that the electrodynamic
interaction has ﬁnite propagation speed, which is a consequence of the
Relativity theory. A straightforward consequence of the theory devel-
oped in [16], and taking into account that gravitational interaction has
also a ﬁnite propagation speed, is that the same model is applicable
to the gravitational 2-body problem.
In [17] a simple gravitational
model based on a functional diﬀerential equation which gives a gravi-
tational quantiﬁcation and an explanation of the modiﬁed Titius–Bode
law is described. In [18] an explanation of the anomalous precession of
Mercury’s perihelion is given in terms of a simple retarded potential,
which, at ﬁrst order, coincides with Gerber’s potential of 1898, and
which agrees with the author’s previous works [16, 17]. In the follow-
ing, we show how the values of the anomalous precession of Mercury’s
perihelion and the gravitational deﬂection of fast particles of General
Relativity can be reproduced by a retarded potential.

First, we review the recent intends to solve the problem of the anoma-
lous precession of Mercury’s perihelion and the gravitational deﬂection
of fast particles of General Relativity in terms of Weber forces.
In
[1], Assis has proposed a theory of gravitation based on Mach’s prin-
ciple, by postulating that the resultant force in any body is zero and
with a Weber type force for gravitation. With a suitable coeﬃcient
for this force he was able to reproduce the advance of the perihelion
of the planets as given by General Relativity, ﬁxing in this way the
only parameter of the theory.
In [23] the gravitational deﬂection of
fast particles was calculated and that the theory does not lead to the
Einstein’s value for the deﬂection of light was shown, see [12]. In fact
the valued obtained is twice as big. Moreover, in [23] it was shown how
both results, the advance of perihelion and fast particle deﬂection, can
be accommodated by using a modiﬁed Weber force. In 1848, Weber
presented a velocity dependent potential

V =

from which the Weber force might be derived. This force form the basis
of the classical Weber’s electrodynamics, see [2].

The basic equation of motion that it was analyzed is

where r is the relative radius vector of the particle with respect to
the Sun. The last term on the right-hand side of (1) is called the
gravitational Weber force per unit of mass. With α = 1/2, (1) is the
expression adopted by Assis, see [1], who needed to ﬁx ξ = 6 to obtain
the right advance of the perihelion of the planets. A law of motion of
type (1) was ﬁrst proposed by Tisserand [27] with α = 1/2 and ξ = 2,
which corresponds to Weber’s law of electrodynamic action. In [23], it
is considered the (small) deﬂection of a fast particle by the Sun with
velocity tending to the speed of light, and with a distance of closest
approach rp much larger than GM/c2. Moreover, the calculation in
Cartesian coordinates, following the same reasoning of Corinaldesi and
Papapetrou [9] for the calculation of the deﬂection of a spinning fast
particle in a Schwarzchild ﬁeld, was performed. Choosing the x axis
perpendicular to the distance of closest approach with the y axis along
it. Therefore, the deﬂection occurs in the plane xy with dy/dx = 0
If the deﬂection is small (rp ≫ GM/c2), it is possible

to write y = rp and x = c t, in the ﬁrst approximation. We then
have r2 = c2t2 + r2
p. Upon integration of d2y/dt2, with the condition
dy/dt = 0 at t = 0, and writing x = c t, the orbit equation becomes

With the value α = 1/2 adopted by Assis and the value ξ = 6 needed
to reproduce the advance of perihelion, we would have δ = 8GM/rp c2,
which is twice as big as the value obtained by Corinaldesi and Papa-
petrou [9] for the deﬂection of a fast, spinless particle by a Schwartzchild
ﬁeld, which is also Einstein’s value δGR for the deﬂection of light, see
also [28]. To reproduce this value, we need to have from (2) the relation

(3)

ξ(2 − α) = 3 .

Therefore, taking into account that the value of ξ needed to reproduce
the advance of perihelion is ξ = 6, if we want to construct a Weber

force which also explains the deﬂection of the light, equation (3) gives
for α the value of α = 3/2, see [23].

In [4], the Weber-like forces are examined from the point of view
of energy conservation and it is proved that they are conservative if
and only if α = 1/2. As a consequence, it is shown that gravitational
theories employing Weber-like forces cannot be conservative and also
yield both the precession of the perihelion of Mercury as well as the
gravitational deﬂection of light.

In [18], the simple retarded potential was presented:

(5)

where r(t − τ − r(t − τ )/c) is the distance between the masses when
the potential was “emitted” to go from the emitting particle to the
receiving particle and come back, and τ = r(t)/c. This retarded po-
tential coincides, at ﬁrst orders, with Gerber’s potential of 1898 and
gives an explanation of the anomalous precession of Mercury’s perihe-
lion because if we develop the retarded potential (4) in powers of τ
(up to second order in τ ), then we ﬁnd that the gravitational force law
associated to this potential is given by

This gravitational force is a Weber type force and it coincides with the
force adopted by Assis [1] (which has the values α = 1/2 and ξ = 6).

In the following, we will see that the simple retarded potential (4)
also gives an explanation of the gravitational deﬂection of fast particles.
Let t0 be the time when the test particle is in closest approach (the
perihelion), i.e., r(t0) = rp. To evaluate the bending we must take
t ≫ t0. If we consider a particle carrying out an unbounded hyperbolic
orbit, at light velocity, and verifying the retarded potential (4) we have
Figure 2, where

d1 = |r(t)| =

where r(t) = (x(t), y(t)). This fact happens because the velocity of the
particle in the orbit is the light velocity. Therefore, from Figure 2, we
have that r(t − τ ) ≪ r(t) and hence, in this case

To develop some easier calculations we can reject, on the right hand side
of expression (7), the term with ¨r (in fact this term is negligible and it
only gives rise to terms of higher order). Hence, at this approximation,
we obtain the velocity–dependent potential

and

(9)

On this basis, of this velocity-dependent potential function (9), the
gravitational force law is given by substituting the potential function

Hence, we obtain a Weber type force with α = 1/2 and ξ = 2. In fact,
the force described in (10) coincides with the Weber type force proposed
by Tisserand [27], which corresponds to Weber’s law of electrodynamic
It is easy to see that these values verify equation (3) and
action.
hence the gravitational force law (10) gives the correct value of the
gravitational deﬂection of fast particles of General Relativity.

3. Concluding remarks

We have seen how the values of the advance of the perihelion of the
planets and the gravitational deﬂection of the fast particles of General
Relativity can be reproduced with the simple retarded potential (4).
In the ﬁrst case, we directly develop the retarded potential in powers of
τ . In the second case, ﬁrst we impose that the velocity of the particle
is close to the light velocity, which implies r(t − τ ) ≪ r(t) and after
we develop the approximation of the retarded potential in powers of
τ . It should also mentioned that, although this model gives identical
results as the one obtained by using General Relativity, these theories
are based on diﬀerent concepts and mathematical tools. In addition,
the diﬀerences appear in the terms of higher order in τ , and the im-
provement of observations and experimental techniques will accomplish
a good test for both theories in the future.

In [1], Assis proposes the postulate that the resultant force acting
on any body is zero. With this postulate and the Weber force law (5)
for gravitation, he obtains equations of motion and concludes that all
inertial forces are due to gravitational interaction with other bodies
in the universe, as it was suggested by Mach. All these arguments
are accomplished in a strictly relational theory, see also [3]. Now, we
have an important landscape which explains the introduction in these
models the Weber’s force. These forces are, in fact, approximations
of retarded forces, taking into account the ﬁnite propagation speed. A
coherent theory of the inertia according with the Mach’s principle lacks
to be given. We hope to give an answer in a future work.

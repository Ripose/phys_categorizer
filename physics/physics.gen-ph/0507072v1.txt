ON THE ORIGIN OF THE GRAVITATIONAL
QUANTIZATION: THE TITIUS–BODE LAW

JAUME GIN´E

Abstract. Action at distance in Newtonian physics is replaced by
ﬁnite propagation speeds in classical post–Newtonian physics. As
a result, the diﬀerential equations of motion in Newtonian physics
are replaced by functional diﬀerential equations, where the delay
associated with the ﬁnite propagation speed is taken into account.
Newtonian equations of motion, with post–Newtonian corrections,
are often used to approximate the functional diﬀerential equations.
In [8] a simple atomic model based on a functional diﬀerential
equation which reproduces the quantized Bohr atomic model was
presented. The unique assumption was that the electrodynamic
interaction has ﬁnite propagation speed. Are the ﬁnite propagation
speeds also the origin of the gravitational quantization? In this
work a simple gravitational model based on a functional diﬀerential
equation gives an explanation of the modiﬁed Titius–Bode law.

1. Introduction

In the last two centuries several attempts were made to express and
explain the distribution of the planetary orbits and other relevant quan-
tities using integer numbers. Titius (1772) and Bode (1776) (see for
instance [12, 22]) proposed the law describing the mean distances of
planets from the Sun of the general form
rn = a + b cn,

where rn means distance characterized by an integer number n. The
constants a, b and c have no convincing physical meaning, neither have
the empirical correlations with deﬁnite parameters for a given system.
Therefore, this law has raised many discussions. Nevertheless, it played
a positive role not only in predicting unknown planets, but also in

stimulating many researches to further work in this direction. In [11]
and [20] there are some reviews about the attempts to test and to
explain the Titius-Bode law.

As a precursor of the modiﬁed Titius-Bode law, Gulak [9] proposed
that the orbital distances are given by rn = (n + 1/2)r0 or rn = nr0,
where r0 is a characteristic of a given system. Here n needs not to in-
crease by 1 in going from one planet or satellite to another one. Gulak
[10] found a theoretical support to his previous results by constructing
an equation of the Schr¨odinger type. In this way, he tried to introduce
the macroquantization of orbits in a gravitational ﬁeld.

In the last years the idea that of a quantization of the gravitational
ﬁeld has been constated. In words of Halton Arp (see [2]): An unex-
pected property of astronomical objects (and therefore an ignored and
suppressed subject) is that their properties are quantized, for instance
the redshifts of galaxies. The most astonishing result was then pointed
to by Jess Artem, that the same quantization ratio that appeared in
quasar redshifts appeared in the orbital parameters of the planets in
the solar system. Shortly, afterward Oliveira Neto et al. [16], Agnese
and Festa [1], L. Nottale et al. [14, 15] and A. and J. Rubˇci´c [20, 21]
independently in Brazil, Italy, France and Croatia began pointing out
similarities to the Bohr atom in the orbital placement of the planets.
Diﬀerent variations of the Bohr-like rn = n2 or rn = n2 + n/2 ﬁt the
planetary semimajor axes extremely well with rather low ”quantum”
numbers n. It is clear that the properties of the planets are not ran-
dom and that they are in some way connected to quantum mechanical
parameters both of which are connected to cosmological properties.

Action at distance in Newtonian physics is replaced by ﬁnite prop-
agation speeds in classical post–Newtonian physics. As a result, the
diﬀerential equations of motion in Newtonian physics are replaced by
functional diﬀerential equations, where the delay associated with the
ﬁnite propagation speed is taken into account. Newtonian equations
of motion, with post–Newtonian corrections, are often used to approx-
imate the functional diﬀerential equations, see, for instance, [3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 18, 19]. In [8] a simple atomic model based on a functional dif-
ferential equation which reproduces the quantized Bohr atomic model
was presented. The unique assumption was that the electrodynamic
interaction has ﬁnite propagation speed, which is a consequence of the
Relativity theory. An straightforward consequence of the theory devel-
oped in [8], and taking into account that gravitational interaction has
also a ﬁnite propagation speed, is that the same model is applicable to

the gravitational 2-body problem. In the following section we present a
simple gravitational model based on a functional diﬀerential equation
which gives an explanation of the modiﬁed Titius–Bode law.

2. The retarded gravitational 2-body problem

We consider two particles of masses m and M, with m ≪ M, in-
teracting through the retarded inverse square force. The force on the
mass m exerted by the mass M is given by

(1)

F = G

M m
r3 r.

Figure 1. The retarded gravitational 2-body problem.

The force acts in the direction of the 3–vector r, along which the mass
M is ”last seen” by the mass m. The 3–vector r may be represented
by

r = rM (t − τ ) − rm(t),
where rM (t) and rm(t) denote respectively the instantaneous position
vectors of the mass M and the mass m, respectively, at time t, and τ
is the delay, so that rM (t − τ ) is the ”last seen” position of the mass
M. Assuming that the two bodies are in rigid rotation with constant
angular velocity ω, and referring back to Fig. 1, we have, in 3–vector
notation,

rm = r1[cos ωt ˆı + sin ωt ˆ],

and

rM = −r2[cos ω(t − τ ) ˆı + sin ω(t − τ ) ˆ].

4

J. GIN´E

Hence, the 3–vector r is given by

r = [−r2 cos ω(t − τ ) − r1 cos ωt] ˆı + [−r2 sin ω(t − τ ) − r1 sin ωt] ˆ,

Now, we introduce the polar coordinates (r, θ) and deﬁne the unitary
vectors l = cos θ ˆı+sin θ ˆ and n = − sin θ ˆı+cos θ ˆ. By straightforward
calculations it is easy to see that the components of the force (1) in the
polar coordinates are

Fr = G

M m
r3 r · l = (−r2 cos(ωτ ) − r1)G

M m
r3

and

(2)

(3)

(4)

Fθ = G

M m
r3 r · n = r2 sin(ωτ )G

M m
r3

The equations of the movement are

m¨r − mr ˙θ2 = Fr,
mr ¨θ + 2m ˙r ˙θ = Fθ.

The second equation (3) can be written in the form

1
r

dL
dt

=

1
r

d

(mr2 ˙θ) = Fθ = r2 sin(ωτ )G

.

If we accurately study equation (4) we see that the analytic function
sin(ωτ ) has a numerable number of zeros given by

ωτ = kπ ,
(5)
with k ∈ Z, which are stationary orbits of the system of equations (2)
and (3). When ωτ 6= kπ we have a torque which conduces the mass
m to the stationary orbits without torque, that is, with ωτ = kπ. In
fact the stationary orbits are limit cycles in the sense of the qualitative
theory developed by Poincar´e, see [17]. On the other hand, in a ﬁrst
approximation, the delay τ can be equal to r/c (the time that the ﬁeld
uses to goes from the mass M to the mass m at the speed of the light).
In this case, from equation (5) we have

(6)

τ =

kπ
ω
Taking into account that ω = vθ/r, from (6) we have vθ/c = kπ.
However, from the Relativity theory we know that vθ/c < 1, then we
must introduce a new constant g in the delay. Hence, τ = g r/c and
the new equation (6) is

r
c

=

.

(7)

τ =

=

kπ
ω

g r

,

and now vθ/c = kπ/g, i.e. vθ = kπc/g and from (7) we also have
r = kπc/(gω). In our model case of a classical rigid rotation we have

THE GRAVITATIONAL QUANTIZATION: THE TITIUS–BODE LAW

θ = ωt with ω > 0. Therefore,
for ωτ = kπ is

˙θ = ω and ¨θ = 0. Hence, equation (3)

2m ˙rω = 0,

which implies ˙r = 0 and r = rk where rk is a constant for each k. On
the other hand, equation (2) for ωτ = kπ takes the form:

(8)

−mr ˙θ2 = −m

= (−r2(−1)n − r1)G

M m
r3 ≈ −rG

M m
r3

,

v2
θ
r

assuming that τ is small and then r ∼ r1 + r2. From the deﬁnition
of angular momentum L = mr2 ˙θ = mr2ω = mrvθ we have that vθ =
L/(mr). Substituting this value of vθ into equation (8) we obtain r =
L2/(GM m2). The energy of the mass m (substituting the values of vθ
and r) is given by

(9)

E =

− G

= −

mv2

M m

G2M 2 m3

.

The angular momentum for ωτ = kπ is

(10)

L = mvθr = m

kπc
g

L2
GM m2 ,

which is an equation for the angular momentum. Isolating the value
of L we obtain L = (GM m g)/(kπc). If we introduce this value of the
angular momentum in the expression of the energy (9) we have

(11)

E = −

mπ2c2
2g2 k2.

The adimensional constant g cannot be determined, of course, unam-
biguously and it must be determined by the experimental data. How-
ever, one may speculate by considering the similarity between the grav-
itational constant force Fg and the electrodynamic force Fe. The ab-
solute ratio of the forces is

where ε0 is the electric permittivity constant of vacuum. By introduc-
ing the well-known ﬁne structure constant α deﬁned by

Fg
Fe

GM m
e2/4πε0

,

α =

e2
4πε0~c

the ratio may be expressed by

Fg

6

where αg is the adimensional gravitational ﬁne structure constant, see
[13]. If we recall the expression of the energy levels for the electrostatic
interaction given by Bohr in 1913
1

m (αc)2 1
n2 ,

E = −

A straightforward generalization gives us that the expression of the
energy levels for the gravitational interaction is

E = −

1
2

m (αgc)2 1
n2 ,

which agrees with the experimental data given in the works [1, 14, 15,
16, 20, 21].

Therefore, comparing with (11) (identifying n = |k|) we must impose
that the constant g = k2g1 where g1 = π/αg and then the energy takes
the form

E = −

m

G2M 2 m2

n2 .

One of the most important diﬀerences between the electrodynamic in-
teraction and the gravitational interaction is that the unit of mass
starts from zero but the basic unit of charge never changes. For this
reason it was diﬃcult to detect the gravitational quantization. The
dependence of the energy levels on the masses M and m makes dif-
ﬁcult to ﬁnd a unique law for the distribution of planets in the solar
system and this is the reason that implies using diﬀerent expressions
for the interior planets and the exterior planets, see [20, 21]. If all the
planets had the same mass m it would be easy to ﬁnd a general law of
distribution similar to the quantization given in atomic models.

Now if we compare this last expression of the energy levels with (11)

we get the explicit value of the Planck constant

(12)

h =

2 GM m g1
c

,

in function of the parameters associated to the particular model system.
The dimensional analysis gives [J · s] = [Nm2/Kg2][Kg][Kg]/[m/s]
which is correct. Therefore we have found the value of the adimensional
constant g1 and consequently the expression of the delay τ which is
= k2 g1r

= k2 πr

(13)

τ =

From the found value of the angular momentum and the value of

vθ = αgc/k we have

Isolating the value of r from equation (14) we obtain

r =

G M k2
g c2 .
α2

Taking into account the value of the gravitational ﬁne structure con-
stant αg and identifying n = |k|, we arrive to the radii of the stationary
orbits

(15)

rn =

h2 n2
2πG M m2 ,

which depends both on M and m. As a consequence of the values of
vθ and rn we have that the period T of revolution of the planets is
proportional to n3 because

Tn =

Therefore, as it must happen, it is satisﬁed the third Kepler’s law, i.e.,
the ratio r3

n does not depend on n.

n/T 2

Summarizing, with the found delay deﬁnition (13), the model pre-
sented in this work explains the modiﬁed Titius–Bode law faithfully.
The gravitational quantization is in fact the ﬁrst approximation in the
value v/c of the delay in the gravitational interaction. This ﬁrst ap-
proach to the macroquantization of orbits is conﬁrmed by the observed
data analyzed in Oliveira Neto et al.
[16], Agnese and Festa [1], L.
Nottale et al. [14, 15] and A. and J. Rubˇci´c [20, 21].

3. Concluding remarks

In [8] the atomic Bohr model is completely described by means
of functional diﬀerential equations.
In this work we have obtained
the “post–Newtonian” approximation of the gravitational ﬁeld. This
“post–Newtonian” approximation is a reminiscent of quantization of
the gravitational ﬁeld. The quantization of the gravitational ﬁeld must
be obtained using the Einstein’s ﬁeld equation and the delay, which
must appear in a natural way in this equation.

As is well known, learning the formal neuron for the reason realization logial operation

faes with beside diffiulties. These problems are bound, first of all, with problem of the branh.

Some algorithms does not manage to realize on apart taken neuron, for instane logial sheme

"exluding or"(XOR).

Some of the problems leaves if realize the neuron as quantum system. As any quantum

objet, neuron is found in vague ondition before proess of the measurement. As suh proess of

exitement, translating neuron in determined ondition, possible onsider presene of the input

signal on synapse of the neuron. Transition in onrete ondition brings about appearane of

the ertain signal on leaving the neuron. Before presenting the input signal an be determined

only probability of the finding of the neuron in a ertain ondition.

We shall Consider two possible realizations of the quantum neuron. Let ondition of neuron

is desribed funtion of the ondition:

here N-amount synapse, ci (cid:21) weighting fators, Ψi (cid:21) set orthogonality funtion:

δij (cid:21) Kronekers symbol, Ψ∗

i (cid:21) funtion omplex assoiate of Ψ∗

i .

Let xi (cid:21) signal given on synapse i. Input signal we an onsider as ondition with funtion

of the ondition:

Then exitement of the neuron will be defined projetion to funtions of the ondition of the

neuron on ondition of the input signal:

Ψ =

ciΨi,

N

Xi=1

y = Θ(hΦ|Ψi − u0)

y = Θ(

cixi − u0)

Xi=1

From orthogonality of funtion we get

Let y (cid:21) the output signal, taking importane zero if neuron in nonexited ondition, and unit

if in agitated. We shall Choose as funtions of the response step-like Θ-funtion:

here u0 (cid:21) threshold of exitement. Neuron does not on signals smaller than u0 , and have reation

on signals greater than u0 .

Substitution (5) in (7) gives:

Given model omplies with lassial neuron, in whih ours the linear summation input signal

with weight. Òíå problem of the eduation of suh neuron is redued to finding weighting

fator ci and threshold of exitement u0 . However exists any problems not allowed within the

framework of suh neuron.

Other possible realization of the quantum neuron is onsideration of importanes of the

input signal as quantum ÷èñåë of the input ondition, on whih is designed neuron. This brings

about restrition of possible importanes of the input signal by rational number.

Neuron is desribed wave funtion:

Ψ =

cn1,...,nkΨ(n1, ..., nk)

Xn1,...,nk

Input signal shall math funtion of the ondition:

Output signal is formed by means of funtions of the response:

Eduation of suh neuron is also redued to hoie of importanes fator cn1,...,nk and u0 .

We shall Consider the realization to logial operation "exluding OR"(XOR), impossible

within the framework of lassial neuron. Let neuron has two ñèíàïòè÷åñêèõ of the entry, that

Φ = Ψ(n1, ..., nk)

y = Θ(hΦ|Ψi − u0)

is to say input vetor X = (x1, x2), xi = 0, 1. We shall require that output signal was zero

(y = 0), if X = (0, 0) or X = (1, 1), and single (y = 1), if X = (1, 0) or X = (0, 1).

As base shall hoose the own funtions of the system two partiles with spin 1/2 eah.

The projetion of spin eah partiles an take importanes +1/2 and −1/2. Funtion of the

ondition of the neuron, with provision for priniple of nondifferentiality of partiles an be

reorded as:

Ψ = 0 · Ψ1(1/2)Ψ2(1/2) + 0 · Ψ1(−1/2)Ψ2(−1/2)

(12)

+ 1 · Ψ1(1/2)Ψ2(−1/2) + 1 · Ψ1(−1/2)Ψ2(1/2).

The Input signal shall form as follows:

The Output signal shall form same step-like funtion by means of all:

Φ = Ψ1(x1 − 1/2)Ψ2(x2 − 1/2).

y = Θ(hΦ|Ψi − 0.5)

Using ondition of normalization

we get the neuron with sought harateristi.

Thereby quantum neuron of the first type equivalent lassial neuron. Quantum neuron of

the seond type allows to realize all elementary logial funtions.

Abstract

It is assumed the existence of the universal potential ﬂuctuations valid for all scales
in the universe which follow the fractal law δU = (∆r/r)2. The value of the uni-
versal potential ﬂuctuations is determined from the data on anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background on degree scales. It is suggested to test the existence of the
universal potential ﬂuctuations in the laboratory experiment.

There are two independent arguments that the universe can be viewed as a fractal with

the law

where m(< r) is the mass restricted within radius r. With the use of heuristic conjecture
Dirac [1] obtained the fractal relation between the microworld scale and the universe scale

m(< r) ∝ r2

where mU and rU are the mass and the radius of the universe, mmic and rmic are the mass
and the radius of microparticle. Pietronero et al. [2] claimed that galaxies have a fractal
distribution

N(< r) ∝ r2

on all scales up to the deepest scales probed until now 1000 h−1 Mpc. Thus it is natural to
assume that the fractal law m(< r) ∝ r2 extends on all scales from the microworld scale to
the universe scale.

Let us assume that there exist universal potential ﬂuctuations valid for all scales in the

universe

That is the universal potential ﬂuctuations follow the above fractal law. The universal po-
tential ﬂuctuations can be registered as angular ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic radiation.
Let us assume that the universal potential ﬂuctuations cause anisotropy of the cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB) on degree scales. The peak of the temperature ﬂuctuations in
the CMB spectrum ∆T /T = 3 × 10−5 is seen at the multipole ℓef f = 260 [3]. These values
can be bounded by the relation

Let us assume that the multipole ℓef f relates with the universal potential ﬂuctuations as

The value ℓef f = 260 yields the value δU = 1.48 × 10−5.

It is interesting to test the existence of the universal potential ﬂuctuations in the labora-
tory experiment. The scheme of the experiment is the following. Two identical sources of the
electromagnetic radiation are placed at the distance ∆r between them and at the distance
r from the detector. The universal potential ﬂuctuations should cause ﬂuctuations of the
temperature of the electromagnetic radiation ∆T /T ∼ 3 × 10−5 at the angle ∆r/r ∼ 1/260.

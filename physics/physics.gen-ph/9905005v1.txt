Recently a duality between superconformal gauge theories on

Dp-branes located at orbifold singularities and supergravities
on AdSp+2 × H 8−p has been established (see [1] and references
therein). Developing this approach, Witten showed [2, 3] that
Grothendieck K-groups of horizon manifolds H 8−p reproduce
spectra of gauge solitons in superconformal gauge theories.

In the present work the K-theory approach is applied to com-

pute the spectrum of gauge solitons in the SU (2, 2|4) supercon-

formal gauge theory.

In terms of grid diagrams [4, 5] the SU (2, 2|4) superconformal

gauge theory is given in Figure 1.

According to [6], the duality identiﬁes this theory with the super-
gravity on AdS5×S5. Our aim can be achieved by computations

of the K-groups

fK(S5) , gKO(S5) , gKSp(S5) .

(1)

To compute K-groups (1), we use the Bott periodicity theorem

[7, 8] recorded in Table 1.

Table 1 tells us that

fK(S5) = 0 , gKO(S5) = 0 , gKSp(S5) = Z2 .

The non-trivial group in (2) reproduces the following spectrum:

Z2 ,

Sp gauge soliton

(where Z2 determines D-brane charges).

The K-theory approach to D-brane charges reminds the ho-

motopy classiﬁcation of vortices in the Landau-Ginzburg theory
of superconductivity [9], where the homotopy group π1(S1) = Z
determines topological charges.

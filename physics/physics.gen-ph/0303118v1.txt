Abstract

We apply the Weber-Fechner’s law, which represents the relation between the magnitude
of physical stimulus and the magnitude of psychological sense in human being, to the utility
function. We conclude that the utility function of n-types of goods is of separable type
u(x1, x2, · · · , xn) = u1(x1) + u2(x2) + · · · + un(xn), which give the relation of the demand
function in the form pi = dui/dxi. The explicit quantitative form of each utility function,
which is suggested by the Weber-Fechner’s law, becomes ui(xi) = Ai log(xi/x(0)
i ). Then we
obtain each demand function in the familiar form pi = Ai/xi.

§1. Introduction

Nowadays it is widely said that the 20-th century was the century of physics but the
21st century is the century of biology. Here and there, the new trend of physics gradually
appears, and pioneers in such new trend physics consider that the physics should treat not
only the science of the nature but also the science of human being[1, 2]. As a result of the
advance of the study of the complex system, we may realize the dream to understand the
origin of life in near future. Today, the progress in biophysics, biochemistry, gene technology,
brain physics etc. is surprising.

In near future, phenomena connected with human being such as behavioral psychological
phenomena will be understand from physics. The important part of economics depend on
the knowledge of behavioral psychology, especially behavioral psychology concerning about
money. In this context, we consider economics as the application of behavioral psychology.
In micro economics, the utility function is one of the most important things, and the func-
tional form of this utility function must be determined from the knowledge of behavioral
psychology. In macro economics, functional dependence of various macro functions such as
the consumption function, the saving function and the investment function etc. must be
determined from the knowledge of behavioral psychology. For example, the consumption

function C is often assumed as C = C(Y − T ) = C0 + c(Y − T ) where Y : national income;
T : tax; c: marginal propensity of consume [3]. This is considered as the law of behavioral
psychology. This law is quite simple but universal and powerful, which govern the behavior
of human being. While, the functional form of the utility function is still in qualitative level
as people use this or that functional form without any scientiﬁc reason.

The most important law in behavioral psychology is Weber-Fechner’s law[4, 5], which
represents the relation between the magnitude of physical stimulus and the magnitude of
psychological sense in human being. In previous paper, we apply this Weber-Fechner’s law
to the utility function, and give the explicit quantitative functional form for the utility
function[6]. In this paper, we give the explicit quantitative functional form for the demand
function by using the utility function proposed in the previous paper. We also give the
interpretation of the relation of this demand function from the view point of consumer’s
surplus.

§2. Demand function from the Weber-Fechner’s law

The well-known and quite important law in behavioral psychology is the Weber-Fechner’s
law[4, 5]. Modiﬁcation of the Weber-Fechner’s law is known as the Stevens’ law, which
is successful in the phenomena of sound[7]. This Weber-Fechner’s law is expressed as ”
the magnitude of psychological sense is proportional to the logarithm of the magnitude of
physical stimulus.” More precisely, we denote the magnitude of psychological sense as u and
the magnitude of physical stimulus as x, then we can express the Weber-Fechner’s law in
the following form

u(x) =

A log
0

x/x(0)
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

if x ≥ x(0)
x < x(0)

(

,

where A is constant and x(0) is the threshold of the magnitude of the physical stimulus. In
the following, we consider only the region where the magnitude of the physical stimulus is
above the threshold value.

We apply this Weber-Fechner’s formula to the utility function[6]. First, we assume that
there is only one type of goods, then the Weber-Fechner’s law suggests that the utility
function u1 is given as the function of the quantity x1 of this goods in the form

(1)

(2)

Next we assume that there are two types of goods, then each utility function u1 and u2
is given as u1(x1) = A1 log(x1/x(0)

1 ) and u2(x2) = A2 log(x2/x(0)

u1(x1) = A1 log(x1/x(0)

1 ).

quantity x1 and x2. It is the natural assumption that the total utility function is just the
sum of each utility function, as each utility obtained by getting each goods is independent.
Then the total utility function in this case is given by

u(x1, x2) = A1 log(x1/x(0)
(x1/x(0)
= log

1 ) + A2 log(x2/x(0)
2 )
1 )A1 × (x2/x(0)
.

2 )A2

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

The second expression in the above means that the total utility function is the logarithm of
the Cobb-Douglas type function. We can generalize this analysis to n types of goods, and
the total utility function is given by

u(x1, x2, · · · , xn) = u1(x1) + u2(x2) + · · · + un(xn),
where
ui(xi) = Ai log(xi/x(0)

i ).

Next, we derive the demand function by using this utility function.
We assume that each price pi of i-th goods is given. According to the standard analysis

to maximize the utility function under budget constraints, we have

∂u/∂x1
p1

=

∂u/∂x2
p2

= · · · =

∂u/∂xn
pn

= k(x1, x2, . . . , xn).

(7)

Using the utility function of separable type Eq(5), we have

du1(x1)/dx1
p1

=

du2(x2)/dx2
p2

= · · · =

dun(xn)/dxn
pn

= k(x1, x2, . . . , xn).

(8)

The above relation is satisﬁed for any number n of types of goods, which means that
k(x1, x2, · · · , xn) = const., because k(x1, x2, · · · , xn) is independent of the type of goods.
This is interpreted as follows. Suppose we consider the (n + 1)-th goods as money itself,
then the (n + 1)-th unility function dun+1(xn+1) Normalizing the utility function, we can
choose k = 1 and obtain the relation of the demand function in the form

(9)

pi =

dui(xi)
dxi

(i = 1, 2, . . . , n),

which is correct for the general utility function of the separable type. The above argument
is interpreted as follows. Suppose we consider the (n + 1)-th goods as money itself, then the
(n + 1)-th utility function dun+1(xn+1), which utility is measured by the unit of money, is

given by dun+1(xn+1) = pn+1xn+1. Then

= 1, which gives k = 1.

dun+1(xn+1)/dxn+1
pn+1

Further, we use the explicit form Eq.(6) of the utility function, which is suggested by the
Weber-Fechner’s law, and we have the explicit quantitative demand function in the familiar
form

pi =

(i = 1, 2, . . . , n).

Ai
xi

(10)

In this way, applying the Weber-Fechner’s law to each utility function and assuming that
total utility is just the sum of the utility of each goods, we obtain the quantitative demand
function in the familiar form.

§3. Demand function from the consumer’s surplus

We derive the relation of the demand function Eq.(9) by using the utility function from
the view point of the consumer’s surplus. Consumer’s surplus is deﬁned in the following way

(Consumer′s surplus) =

p(x′)dx′ − px,

(11)

x

Z

where x and p is the price and the quantity of goods. We deﬁne the concept of ”consumer’s
proﬁt” ρ(x) as ρ(x) = u(x)−px, that is, the ”consumer’s proﬁt” means the proﬁt of money in
mind minus the loss of money paid to obtain goods. Then the concept of the consumer’s sur-
plus is equal to the ”consumer’s proﬁt”, that is, (consumer’s surplus)=(”consumer’s proﬁt”)
= ρ(x) = u(x) − px. This gives the relation

where we assume u(0) = 0 as the utility function should have this property. Then we again
obtain the relation of the demand function in the same form as Eq.(9)

from the view point of the consumer’s surplus.

We deﬁne the ”supplier’s proﬁt” π(x) as π(x) = px − c(x) where c(x) is the cost function.
As is well-known, the supply function is derived by maximizing this ”supplier’s proﬁt”. Then
the relation of the supply function is given by

Supply function :

dπ(x)
dx

= p −

dc(x)
dx

= 0.

Similarly, we can derive the demand function by maximizing the ”consumer’s proﬁt ”,
ρ(x) = u(x) − px. Then the relation of the demand function is given in the same form as
Eq.(9)

Demand function :

dρ(x)
dx

=

du(x)
dx

− p = 0.

In this way, the relation of the demand function is derived just in the same way as the
the relation of the supply function from the view point of the consumer’s surplus and we
again obtain the same relation Eq.(9) for the demand function.

§4. Summary and discussion

We try to reconstruct economics as the application of behavioral psychology. The most
important law in behavioral psychology is the Weber-Fechner’s law, which represent the
relation between the magnitude of physical stimulus and the magnitude of psychological
sense in human being. While the utility function is one of the most important thing in
micro economics. In this paper, we apply the Weber-Fechner’s law to determine the explicit
quantitative utility function. Then utility function becomes in the form of the logarithm
of the Cobb-Douglas type function. We conclude that i) the utility function of n-types of
goods are separable u(x1, x2, · · · , xn) = u1(x1) + u2(x2) + · · ·+ un(xn), ii)each utility function
becomes ui(xi) = Ai log(xi/x(0)
i ). From the property i), we have the relation of the demand
function in the form pi = dui/dxi. Using also the property ii), which is suggested by the
Weber-Fechner’s law, we have the explicit quantitative demand function in the familiar form
pi = Ai/xi. We also derive the relation of the demand function from the view point of the
consumer’s surplus and obtain the same relation pi = dui/dxi for the demand function.

In this way, as the application of the Weber-Fechner’s law to the utility function, we
obtain the quantitative demand function in the familiar form. Our analysis is the zero-th
order approximation for the demand function. If we modify the Weber-Fechner’s law into
Stevens’ law, we obtain the more complicated demand function.

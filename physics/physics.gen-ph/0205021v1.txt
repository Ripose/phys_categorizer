Abstract

From Eq.(2), we obtain

In this paper, we point out that there are at lest six the-
orems in physics sharing common virtue of Pythagoras
theorem, so that it is possible to string these theorems
together with the Pythagoras theorem for physics teach-
ing, the six theorems are Newton’s three laws of motion,
universal gravitational force, Coulomb’s law, and the for-
mula of relativistic dynamics . Knowing the internal re-
lationships between them, which have never been clearly
revealed by other author, will beneﬁt the logic of physics
teaching.

1 Introduction

If there is one mathematical theorem that is familiar
to every university student, it is surely the theorem of
Pythagoras. The theorem was embedded in physics like a
gene even at the initiation of physics, because the physics
begins with describing the motion of a body in a frame of
reference by mathematical language—inevitably includ-
ing the Pythagoras theorem. Therefore, by seizing the
Pythagoras theorem, we hope draw out some deeper re-
lationships in the physics.

Consider a particle of rest mass m in our frame of
reference S(x1, x2, x3, t), the particle moves a distance
∆l during inﬁnitesimal time interval ∆t with speed v,
according to Pythagoras theorem, we have

∆l2 = v2∆t2 = ∆x2

1 + ∆x2

2 + ∆x2

(1)

The above equation directly forms the velocity formula
given by

d( 1

2 mv2)
dt

= f

v

·

(4)

From the above two equations, we have seen what we
want; when f represents the force exerting on the particle,
Eq.(3) is the Newton’s second law of motion, and Eq.(4)
is the kinetic energy theorem.

2 An approach to Newton’s three

laws of motion

We may rewrite the above section in an axiomatical way.
Axiom 1: Pythagoras theorem is valid only in inertial

frame of reference.

quences.

From this Axiom we can derive out some useful conse-

Consequence 1: The Newton’s second law of motion
can be derived from the axiom 1, accompanied by deriving
out the kinetic energy theorem for a particle.

Consequence 2: The Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion can

also be derived from the axiom 1, because of Eq.(3).

Now we consider a composite system which contains
two particles Bob and Alice, whereas both Bob and Al-
ice are also composed of many identical constituent par-
ticles, the number of the constituents in Bob is N , the
number in Alice is N ′. The composite system of Alice
and Bob can be regraded as a single particle whose geo-
metric center has a velocity vc given by

vc =

N v + N ′v′
N + N ′

v2 = v2

1 + v2

2 + v2
3

Multiplying the above equation by the rest mass m, dif-
ferentiating it with respect to time, and deﬁning a symbol
f as

Without the lost of generality, we have supposed that the
N constituents of Bob have the same velocity v, likewise
for Alice with v′. Since the composite system of Bob and
Alice can be regraded as a single particle, it obeys the
Newton’s second law of motion as

f =

d(mv)
dt

d[(N + N ′)mvc]
dt

= fext.

(5)

(6)

(2)

where m is the mass of one constituent, fext. represents
the external force exerting on the composite system. If
the external force vanishes, then the system becomes

d(N mv)
dt

+

d(N ′mv′)
dt

= N f + N

′f ′

= 0

(7)

where f represents the force exerting on each constituent
of Bob, likewise f ′ on each constituent of Alice. Eq.(7)
has expressed the law of action and reaction. So we get
Consequence 3: The newton’s third law of motion can

also be derived from the axiom 1 for composite system.

Even if composite particle is not composed of identi-
cal constituent particles, the Consequence 3 is also valid.
Because it is always possible to divide composite particle
into many identical units, each unit is so small enough
that the each unit has the same mass, it is not necessary
for the unit to be a real elementary particle.

3 An approach to universal grav-

itational force

We continue to consider the composite system composed
of two particles Bob and Alice, If they do not aﬀected by
external force, their motions obey the Newton’s second
law of motion as

Bob : N

d(mv)

= N f

(9)
Let vector r denote the position of Bob with respect to
Alice, according to the Newton’s third law of motion,
N f + N ′f ′ = 0, we obtain that f (or f ′) parallel or anti-
parallel r.

Vector-multiplying Eq.(8) by r, because f parallels r ,

we have

It means

v = h = const.

r

where h is an integral constant. Likewise for Alice. Using
r, we can expand f in a Taylor series in 1/r, this gives

Since bi are the coeﬃcients that are independent from
distance r, integral constant h and integral constant ε,
they take the same values for various cases which have
various man-controlled parameters h and ε. Now we con-
sider two extreme cases.

First case: Bob is at rest forever.
According to the Newton’s ﬁrst law of motion, the in-
teraction between them must completely vanishes. Since
Bob’ speed v should not depend on the distance, accord-
,
ing to Eq.(13), a reasonable solution may be r =
∞
b0 = 0, b1 = 0 and ε = 0. To note that the values of b0
and b1 do not depend on this extreme case.

Second case: with h

0, Bob passes the perihelion

point about Alice with a distance r

0.

→

According to Eq.(14), a reasonable solution may be
that the all coeﬃcients bi are zero but except b2 and
0. Because b3 does not depend on h, we ﬁnd b3 = 0.
b3 →
According to the two extreme cases, we obtain a gen-
eral expression given by

four expressions do not rely on whether the situation is
extreme case.

Alice : N

N N ′r

As the most simple case, the constituents have identical
mass, so the number N of constituents in Bob and N ′ in
Alice can directly represent the mass of Bob and the mass
of Alice, respectively.
If K takes a negative constant,
then, the above equations show that Bob is attracted
by Alice with the Newton’s universal gravitational force.
Thus we get

Consequence 4:

the Newton’s universal gravitational
force can be derived from the axiom 1. But the nature of
being attractive or repulsive depends on experiments.

Even if composite particles are not composed of identi-
cal constituent particles, the Consequence 4 is also valid,
the reason is the same as in the preceding section.

3.1 An approach to Coulomb’s force

In this section we give an explanation of Coulomb’s force
by using the most simple model: all particles are com-
posed of identical constituents.

From the above section, now we can manifestly inter-
pret the quantity f as the force exerting on a constituent
of Bob. It is a natural idea to think of that constituents
have two kinds of charges: positive and negative. If Bob
and Alice are separated by a far distance, and f is the
f is
force acting on a positive constituent in Bob, then
the force acting on a negative constituent in Bob. Re-
gardless of the internal forces in Bob, it follows from
Eq.(8) that the motion of the ith constituent in Bob is
governed by

−

d(mv(i))
dt

= f (i)

d( 1

2 mv(i)2)
dt

= f (i)

v(i)

(23)

·

where v(i) and f (i) denote the velocity and the force act-
ing on the ith constituent, respectively, m denote the
mass of a constituent. Summing over all constituents in
Bob, we get

N

Xi=1

d(mv(i))
dt

=

d

[m

v(i)] =

f (i) = qfc

where vc is the central velocity of Bob, q denotes the net
charge number of Bob, fc denotes the force acting on the
constituent which locates at the geometric center of Bob
( this central constituent may be virtual one because it
features the average action), we obtain

d(N mvc)
dt

= qfc

Like that in the above section, the Newton’s laws of
motion must be valid for the whole composite system of
Bob and Alice, in other words, when they are separated
from a inﬁnite distance they are isolated, whereas they go
to nearest point they should not touch each other, these
requirements lead to

where q′ denotes the net charge number of Alice. We get

The Eq.(31) and Eq.(32) are known as the Coulomb’s
forces.

Consequence 5: Coulomb’s force can be derived from

the axiom 1.

Even if composite particles are not composed of identi-
cal constituent particles, the Consequence 5 is also valid.
Because it is always possible to divide composite particle
into many identical units, each unit is so small enough
that each unit having the same mass is assigned a charge
unit by keeping the net charges unchanged, it is not nec-
essary for the unit to be a real elementary particle.

Obviously, Eq.(43) is just the relativistic energy of the

more, the mass m is called the rest mass of the particle
while

Eq.(36) can be rewritten as

=

dxµ
icdτ

cosh2 α1 + cosh2 α2 + cosh2 α3 + cosh2 α4 = 1

or

cosh αµ cosh αµ = 1(47)

The above equation indicates that there is a deﬁnite like-
Euclidean trigonometry in the Minkowski’s space, despite
all that the fourth axis is imaginary, the quantity αµ may
be understood as the angle between dxµ and icdτ .

As the most simple case, only consider the motion tak-
ing place in the plane (x1, x4), the length icdτ makes an-
gles α1 and α4 with respect to the lengths dx1 and dx4
respectively, we have

cosh2 α1 + cosh2 α4 = 1

(48)

The above equation indicates that the two angles α1 and
α4 have formed a ”right-angled triangle” in the plane
(x1, x4). By deﬁning symbol

sinh α4 = cosh α1

(49)

we get

plane (x1, x4), and becomes another new coordinate sys-

(4)If Bob is at rest at the origin of the system S′, i.e.
x′
1 = 0, from Eq.(55), we know that Bob will be moving
at speed v = dx1/dt in the system S. In other words,
the system S′ is ﬁxed at Bob, while Bob is moving at
the speed v along the axis x1 of the system S. Coupling
with this explanation, Eq.(55) and Eq.(56) are just the
Lorentz transformation.

(5)The constancy of the speed of light, length contrac-
tion and time dilation can evidently be derived from the
Lorentz transformation equations.

Therefore, we get
Consequence 6: The formula of relativistic dynamics

can be derived from the axiom 1.

5 Two kinds of 4-vector forces

(1) In Minkowski’s space, according to Eq.(41) and
Eq.(42), we can deﬁne a 4-vector force as

f

≡
f4 =

(F, f4)
u
F

·
u4

−

(57)

(58)

then Eq.(41) and Eq.(42) may be rewritten as

f =

d(mu)
dτ

or

fµ =

(59)

d(muµ)
dτ

Obviously, the 4-vector force f and 4-vector velocity u
satisﬁes orthogonal relation[3]

u

f = uµfµ = uµ

·

d(muµ)
dτ

= m

d(uµuµ)
dτ

= m

d(

c2)

−
dτ

= 0

(60)

This result is easy to be understood when we note that
the magnitude of the 4-vector velocity keeps constant, i.e.
= √uµuµ = ic, any 4-vector force can never change
u
|
the magnitude of the 4-vector velocity but can change its
direction in the Minkowski’s space.

|

The orthogonal relation of 4-vector force and 4-
vector velocity is a very important feature for basic
interactions[4].

(2) In analogy with the relativistic mechanics, New-

ton’s mechanics may also have its own 4-vector force.

According to Eq.(3) and Eq.(4), we deﬁne 4-vector

v

(3) Both Newton’s mechanics and relativistic mechan-
ics can be derived from the same Pythagoras theorem in
rigorous manner, but modern physics have clearly show
that it prefers to the relativistic mechanics, it was said
that the newton’ mechanics is an excellent approxima-
tion when the motion is slow with respect to the speed
of light.

If we use the speed of sound to replace the speed of
light in Eq.(33), we would obtain a dynamics resemble to
the relativistic mechanics, in which the speed of sound
takes place the role of the speed of light, how do physics
accept it?

(4) Pythagoras theorem has a long history, after Greek
philosopher Pythagoras ( 500 B.C. ). Other ancient civi-
lizations also have the same theorem, such as India ( 500
B.C.—200 B.C.)[7], China ( 1100 B.C.—200 B.C. )[8].
In China, Pythagoras theorem is called the GouGu the-
orem, even today. Both western and eastern share the
common wisdom of their ancient civilizations.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we regard Pythagoras theorem as an axiom,
from this axiom we derived out six important theorems of
physics, they are Newton’s three laws of motion, univer-
sal gravitational force, Coulomb’s force, and the formula
of relativistic dynamics. The results indicate that at least
the mechanics is possible to be geomertrized, so that it is
possible to string together these theorems with Pythago-
ras theorem. Knowing the internal relationships between
them, which have never been clearly revealed by other
author, will beneﬁt our physics teaching.

Generally speaking, we have absolute conﬁdence on
Pythagoras theorem, we have no doubts on the pre-
ceding results which have realize the geometrization of
physics, we must equally treat with the Newton’s me-
chanics and the relativistic mechanics, rather than that
one is another’s approximation. The author is not intent
to shake the established modern physical contents but to
pursue the faith coming from the Pythagoras theorem,
the Pythagoras theorem is also an well established law
which is at least 2500 years old.

Why the nature seems to prefer to the relativistic me-
chanics ? We here gives a trial explanation. In one hand,
to note that all measurements about distance and time
must use facilities whose principles are directly or indi-
rectly based on the light, therefore, all phenomena in our
optical eyes or instruments have had to involve the speed
of light, so that the action we perceive is the force F
of Eq.(41) rather than the force f of Eq.(3), hence the
nature we perceive is the would obeying the relativistic
mechanics. In another hand, if our measurements are ac-
complished by virtue of inﬁnite communicating speed (if
it exists ), the nature we perceive will be the world obey-
ing the Newton’s mechanics. This explanation is com-
pletely compatible with the standard contents of modern
physics, because we knew in textbooks[5][6] that rela-
tivistic mechanics reduces to Newton’s mechanics when
c becomes inﬁnite, prooﬁng that our eﬀort is not intent
to oﬀend the established physics but to provide a new
insight into the subject.

6 Discussion

(1) The six theorem derived from Pythagoras theorem
in the preceding sections form the fundamentals of me-
chanics, from them other useful theorems, such as the La-
grange’s Equation and Hamilton’s principle, etc., can also
be derived out. With this results, we recognize that the
Pythagoras theorem is the origin of the whole mechanics.
It becomes possible to establish an axiomatical system for
the subject, both for teaching and research, especially,
the experiments addressing to to test the mechanics may
be canceled from our classroom because an axiomatical
system couldn’t tolerate the existence of many initiations
in the subject.

(2) What is the inertial frame of reference? Our answer
is that the frame in which Pythagoras theorem is valid
is just the inertial frame of reference. This answer has a
little diﬀerent from that in traditional textbooks.

In an accelerated frame of reference, Pythagoras theo-
rem needs a modiﬁcation, this situation open a way lead-
ing to the subject of general theory of relativity.

(3) Eq.(12) expresses the interaction expanded in a
Taylor series in 1/r.
letting it contain a Taylor series
in r is not necessary, because the r series would be can-
.
celed when we need the interaction vanishes for r
→ ∞

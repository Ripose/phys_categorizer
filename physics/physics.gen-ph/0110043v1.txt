Some simple physical facts about the collapse of
the Twin Towers

Juan Betancort Rijo

July 14, 2011

To understand the collapse of these towers, it is useful to consider the fol-
lowing simple mechanical problem: take a pile of n equal blocks of height s,
put on top of each other separated by empty gaps of height h containing only
the supporting beams. Now, if the beams inmediately below the uppermost
block are suddenly blown oﬀ, it would start falling with acceleration g and zero
initial velocity. After falling a height h, it collides with the next block at a
speed √2gh. If the corresponding kinetic energy of the block is large compared
with with the energy required for bending or breaking the beams, conservation
of linear momentum imply (completely inelastic collision) both blocks moving
together with speed √2gh/2 and acceleration g. After falling a height h, both
blocks collide with the next one at certain velocity, thereby moving the three
blocks together at 2/3 of this speed, and so on. The lower surface of the falling
pile we may call collapse front and its motion is a free fall in between collisions
and discontinuous (considering the collisions instantaneous) changes of velocity
and position (sadden jump by an amount s) at collisions. However, for n large,
it is interesting to consider the average motion of the collapsing front. In the
h (the correction for ﬁnite s/h being trivial) it may easily be shown
limit s
that this average motion is uniformly accelerated with acceleration g/3. More
generally, taking into account the height of the blocks and the energy absorbed
by the beams, one ﬁnds:

where u(t) is the position of the front from its initial position (the lower surface
of the upper block), f is the ratio between the total energy absorbed by the
beams and the potential energy of the pile and t is the time elapsed from the
start of the collapse.

Having mass in between the blocks (i.e. in the form of walls) does not change
the nature of the collapse. If these masses move along with the blocks or are
blown away at collision carrying no momentum, the acceleration is still g/3 (for
s
0). If the fraction of momentum carried away by the falling wall is F , the
collapse is an accelerated motion with acceleration g(1

F )/3.

Now consider the case when the beams blown away are those above the m-th
block. In this case, assuming s = f = F = 0 (corrections being trivial) it may be
shown that, before the uppermost block hit it, the front falls with acceleration
3g/5. The n
m blocks above the front fall together with acceleration g until the
uppermost block hit the front. At this time, the acceleration (average) changes
suddenly to 7g/25 and grows asimptotically to g/3.

However, for this mode of collapse to apply, the blocks must be completely
incompressible, so that the acceleration of the upper and lower surfaces of the
collapsed pile experience not only the same mean acceleration, but also the
same very strong upwardly directed acceleration at collisions. In this case and
assuming that the ratio between the actual statical charge supported and the
maximum possible charge, c, is constant all through the pile, the beams just
over the upper surface of the collapsed pile are equally likely to break as those
below. On the other hand, when the blocks have a ﬁnite compressibility, the
ratio between the statical charge and the dinamical charge at collisions is smaller
above the upper surface. In this case, after the collapsed pile have grown to some
thickness, it provides a suﬃcient cushion for the upper part to fall bodily resting
on the collapsed pile. Then, the acceleration of the collapse front is again g/3.
The upper block falls with the same acceleration at a constant distance from
the front. The tremor of the collapse may cause the collapse from time to time
of the block just above the collapsing pile, but this results in constant average
speed for the motion of the upper block with respect to the front.

If the blocks break into irregular fragments, they would roll down from the
top of the collapsed pile. This mode of mass loss is diﬀerent from the one
considered previously and do not result in uniform acceleration. Asimptotically
the collapsed pile approachs a maximum thickness, the acceleration decreases
and at some stage the beams will be strong enough to halt the collapse.

the collapsing front is about 370 m above the ground. Assuming c = 5 constant
0.02 1. With F = 0, the time
all through the pile, it may be shown that f
for the collapse front to hit the ground given by Eq. (1) is 14.56 s. Since the
actual time seems to be around 17 s, this imply that the fraction of mass blown
away from the pile as the walls are squashed is somewhat above 1/4 (assuming
no matter fall from the back of the collapsed pile).

Abstract

We use the discrete kinetic theory with the free-orientation parameter being ﬁxed (π/4)
to derive the macroscopic velocity ﬁeld for many particles ﬂowing through a microdomain.
Our results resemble qualitatively other hydrodynamical solutions. The V-shaped velocity
ﬁeld changes as the dominant physical parameter (Knudsen number) varies. We also brieﬂy
discuss the possible mechanism due to the entropy production along the boundaries.

Keywords : Knudsen number, discrete kinetic model, dilute gases.

1 Introduction

Discrete kinetic theory [1-2] with the thermostat assumption or diﬀuse scattering boundary con-

dition [3] have been adopted to ad hoc model the many-particle scattering situation along the

gas-surface interacting interface in a plane channel [1]. Speciﬁc orientations relevant to diﬀerent

rarefaction parameters were identiﬁed therein [1]. Motivated by the recent interests in the quan-

tum Boltzmann approach [4] and the relevant studies [5-8], we continue our previous studies [1]

by examining the related velocity and vorticity ﬁelds corresponding to those speciﬁc θ and Kn

we obtained and checking the special case θ = π/4.

Many interesting problems have been successfully solved [9-17] by using the discrete kinetic the-

ory. Carleman (1957) developed 2-velocity models which are deﬁned by abstract properties in

order to produce only mathematical purposes. That model was not constructed on the basis of

detailed analysis of the collision mechanics [9]. Broadwell (1964) devised a 6-velocity model to

handle the simple shock wave problem [10]. At ﬁrst mathematicians have been interested in the

discrete Boltzmann equation with the hope to provide, thanks to the relatively simpler struc-

ture of the equation as compared with that of the full Boltzmann equation, stronger results than

those available for the Boltzmann equation or mathematical results suitable to be technically

generalized to the full Boltzmann equation in the analysis of initial and initial-boundary value

problems. However, the analysis over recent years has shown that this is not the case [5,7-8].

These have been reviewed considering mainly the mathematical aspects of the initial and initial-

boundary value problems in order to provide a ”more detailed” analysis in a ”more specialized”

ﬁeld. In fact the consistency of the mathematical results depends on the structure of the math-

ematical problems : in some cases it is possible to obtain for the discrete Boltzmann equation

”stronger” results than the corresponding ones for the Boltzmann equation, and in other case

”weaker” results. Kawashima has proved the global existence of solutions to the initial-boundary

value problems (I.-B.V.P.) for the discrete Boltzmann Equation in the 1D-region 0 < x <

or

0 < x < d (cf [11]).

Cornille obtained some transient or stationary family of solutions for certain (ﬁxed-orientation)

discrete velocity models without considering the boundary conditions [12].

In this short paper, we plan to reconstruct the macroscopic velocity ﬁeld of many dilute particles

by the veriﬁed 4-velocity model [18] (the free orientation is ﬁxed to be θ = π/4) considering a

simple test problem : many molecules or particles ﬂowing along the bounded-plane channel and

ﬁnally reaching a steady state. The veriﬁcation of our approaches has been done in [1,6] (cf.

Chu), the argues about the diﬀerences between diﬀerent discrete velocity models included. For

θ = π/4 case, using a completely diﬀerent solving procedure, we obtained velocity ﬁelds which

have a V-shaped or chevron-structure.

This short note is organized as follows. We introduce the general orientation-free [5,6] 4-velocity

model in Section 2, and simplify it to a system of four equations for associated unknown func-

tions. The general boundary conditions will be brieﬂy introduced, too. Then, we deﬁne some

macroscopic variables (like u, v) to suit our interest which is to ﬁnd a class of steady (and paral-

lel) non-boundary-driven solutions or ﬂows for particles ﬂowing along a microslab with bounded

(ﬂat-plane) walls. The orientation will be ﬁxed as π/4 here when we solve the time-independent

system of equations with relevant boundary conditions for the test case. As reported in [18],

there will be no dispersion or absorption when we implement the model with this orientation so

that we can resolve sharp velocity proﬁles. These kinds of solutions, u, which collect the main

results of the present paper, are given in explicit form, and are functions of 1D coordinate : y

or Y and are also dependent on certain integration constants or parameters due to the purely

diﬀuse reﬂection boundary conditions. Finally, we analyze the solutions (V-shaped ﬁelds) and

make some physical comments or discussions in comparison with the other ﬂow-pattern selection

due to the relative orientation eﬀect upon binary encounter of many particles or unusual entropy

production along the conﬁned boundaries.

2 Formulations

Considering a simple ﬂuid of particles with mass m and cross-sectional area σ, the ﬁrst step

of the modelling procedures consists in discretizing the velocity directions in a ﬁnite number of

unit vectors ik, k = 1,

, p. One or more moduli are then associated to each direction. The

· · ·

ratio of the moduli has, however, to be properly chosen, so that collisions between particles

with diﬀerent velocity moduli are possible. For one velocity moduli case, ui= cik, k = 1,

, p;

c(x, t) in general. Normally c is determined by the equilibrium distribution.

c

≡

The particles (hard-sphere) move in the whole space and collide by simple elastic collisions

locally in space. The mathematical model is an evolutional equation for the number densities

Ni(x, t) linked to the ﬁnite set of velocities ui. We write a balance equation for the number

where Li and Gi are the loss and the gain of the particles ”i” due to collisions. In case of binary

collisions an exact balance may be obtained, and is expressed with the transitional probabilities

diﬀerential equations of hyperbolic type. Above equation could also be written as

than the physical ones or conservation laws which are corresponding to the number of macro-

scopic variables (in 2D. there are only 4, i.e., one mass, two momenta, one energy). That’s to

say, there are unphysical or spurious invariants or macroscopic variables for q

3 models (which

could be, however, well handled by adding multiple collisions [13]). Thus, we plan to use only

the orientation-free 4-velocity model for our test-case problem below.

2.1 Boundary Conditions

We use purely diﬀuse reﬂection boundary condition [1,3,15-16] here, which means properties of

the reﬂected particles are independent of their properties before the impact. In other words, the

re-emitted stream has completely lost its memory of the incoming stream, except for the conser-

vation of the number of particles. Moreover, we impose the following conditions : the particles

are in Maxwellian equilibrium with the wall (”the wall locally behaves as a thermostat”, i.e., the

particles reﬂect after they have been in thermodynamic equilibrium with the wall-temperature)

satisﬁes Ni(r, t)=γi(r, t)Nwi(r, t), where γi expresses the accomodation of the particles to the

wall quantities, and Nwi is the discrete Maxwellian densities for the ’i’-direction set of particles.

2.2 Flows in a Plane Channel

We ﬁrstly deﬁne the related macroscopic variables n = N1 + N2 + N3 + N4, nU =c(αN1 −
αN3 + βN4), nV = c(βN1 + αN2 -βN3 −
x- and y-directions) with ρ = n m, m is the mass of the molecule, ρ is the macroscopic density

βN2 −
αN4), (the latter two are the momentum ﬂux along

of the gas. Then, set ni = Ni/n, i = 1, 2, 3, 4; and then use non-dimensional u = U/c, v = V /c,

Y = y/d, where c may be related to the external forcing [1,19]. d is the full channel width.

y = 0 is along the center-line.

The geometry of a 2D problem we shall consider is a kind of microchannels with bounded ﬂat-

plane walls which are separated apart by a width d. Particles (driven by an external constant

forcing initially) ﬂowing along this channel will ﬁnally reach a fully developed state (steady state

and ∂u/∂x = 0, v = 0).

We derive the solutions with α(

cos θ) = β(

sin θ) = √2/2 case here. The algorithm is diﬀer-

≡

≡

ent from those previously reported, we must solve the independent number density respectively

then combine them into macroscopic ones since the original macroscopic equation is singular

(cf. equations in [6] by Chu). Meanwhile, from the preliminary results reported in Ref. [1,18], it

seems, for the case of θ = π/4, 4-velocity model will give completely diﬀerent dispersion relations

for the thermodynamic checking of the perturbed Maxwellian equilibrium state. There will be

no dispersion or absorption for this particular case.

This class of solution u obtained by ﬁxing the orientation to be π/4 is in general diﬀerent from

those reported in Ref.

[6] by Chu. Note that, for one extreme case of boundary conditions as

We can easily observe that, from equation (11), that u = 0 everywhere for all Knudsen numbers

(Kn). There is no macroscopic ﬂow [20] for many particles once the boundary conditions are

selected above.

Otherwise, the velocity ﬁeld (from equation (11)) as shown in ﬁgure 2 is qualitatively similar to

the V-shaped or chevron-like structure or pattern [21] reported before in other physical systems.

The velocity ﬁeld is tuned mainly by the Kn and weakly by a and b with the latter due to

the boundary conditions. We note that a might depend on the physical properties of ﬂuids

and the geometry of the solid-wall as it comes from the gas-solid interaction or reﬂection. The

ﬂow-pattern selection mechanism is yet open to the best knowledge of the authors but might be

partially linked to that reported in Ref. [1,6] (cf. Chu) since there will be an essential singularity

when integrating equation (1) for θ = π/4 case. In short, as Kn increases, the chevron front

becomes more ﬂat.

of rarefaction measure for many-particles interactions or collisions) is ﬁxed, the vorticity is a

constant with the related Bij subjected to the constraint in equation (2). In fact, Bij should

depend on the detailed interactions of the gas-solid interface, like a kind of (known) molecules

colliding with speciﬁc walls made of (already) speciﬁed material. It is bounded above but diﬃ-

cult to be ﬁxed even for speciﬁc model and boundary value problem [11].

Our results for the vorticity ﬁeld, at least, qualitatively matches with the hydrodynamic two-

dimensional solution [20] when the weakly compressible (incompressible) particles ﬂow along a

static ﬂat-plane channel and ﬁnally reach a fully developed state even though the particles are

initially driven by a constant pressure-gradient or unit forcing. Interestingly, similar sharp ﬂow

ﬁelds of solitary wave proﬁles (the highest one, cf. Figs. 9 and 10 by Wu et al.

in [22]) and

constant-V vortex was reported recently [22] in other physical system dealing with conﬁned ﬂow

transports.

To further interpret the mechanism, we propose that the complicated rate of entropy produc-

tion along the boundaries (cf. [23-24]) might favor the smearing of viscous diﬀusion (toward the

away-from-wall regions) so that the sharp and strange pattern could form and then there is no

signiﬁcant smoothing of the proﬁles along the cross-section.

Note that, the approach here : ﬁrstly tracing or obtaining (solving the corresponding equation

in (3)) each individual discrete number density (ni) then by summing up the corresponding

projection to obtain u, is diﬀerent from that in [6] (by Chu) : directly construct the macroscopic

solutions from the relevant governing equation for macroscopic variables (u). The boundary

treatment which is relevant to the entropy production there is thus entirely diﬀerent. The cor-

responding non-equilibrium states (due to diﬀerent rates of entropy production and their decay)

8

approaching to the ﬁnal equilibrium states which are used as our boundary conditions might

then be diﬀerent.

In fact, as we noticed, the argument raised in [24] could be applicable to

present approach as evidenced in the boundary operator as expressed in equation (2) (could

be represented as similar divergence form). Otherwise, if our interpretations don’t work, there

might exist other unknown mechanism which need our further works.

We derive generalized ideal gas equations for structureful universe cosisting of clusters. Each
cluster contains smaller clusters. These clusters are divided into even smaller ones and so on. Our
model is independent of the shape and size of the intermediate clusters. Our calculations are valid
within non-relativistic regime.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ideal gas equations are applied to non-interacting dilute gas. The molecules in gas phase are so far away from
one another, it makes no diﬀerence if we ignore the molecular interaction. These molecules are further subject to
Heisenberg uncertainty principle [1]. When dealing with the universe as whole, the molecules or nucleons are not
uniformly distributed over the space. There exists various scales. The nucleons are particles in a star and at larger
scale the stars are particle of galaxy and so on. One is therefore required to generalize the ideal gas equations in order
to incorporate all scales. We derive here such generalized gas equations.

In an earlier paper, based on conﬁguration space, we address future orientation of time with the growth of entropy
[2]. In the present paper we extend the same model to phase space. In this model we assume that the universe is
structureful consisting of clusters. Each cluster contains smaller clusters. These clusters are divided into even smaller
ones and so on. Such a description is called the universal self-similarity [2]. It should be noted that, for instance,
cluster of galaxies are bound, virialized, high overdensity system, held together by the cluster self gravity [3]. In this
perspective we can say that our model intrinsically incorporates gravity.

We assume that on large scale the universe is homogeneous, isotropic [4] and unique [2,5]. We further assume that
all forms of the matter in the universe are contained in clusters. Each cluster contains sub-clusters and so on. We
treat these clusters, at their corresponding scales, are being particles of ideal gas. We conﬁne ourself to nonrelativistic
regime.

We can represent the universe by a set Gn [2]

where Gn−1
i
of set Gn. Similarly

represents ith cluster and Nn is the number of clusters in Gn. We can regard Nn is the cardinal number

We can continue this to sub-atomic level and ﬁnally we get

where G0

k corresponds to constituent particle which has no further substructure.
The spatial distribution of accessible states for this system can be written as [1,2,6]

We can generalize it as follow

As we know that

n is the spatial volume of Gn and ∆V α

n−1 is the volume occupied by Gn−1
where V α
arbitrarily small. It is much smaller at the scale of Gn whereas at the scale of Gn−1

where s is the entropy and kB is the Boltzmann’s constant. On substituting eq. (5) into eq. (4), we get

where sα is the spatial entropy and ∆V α

0 is the spread or uncertainty in volume of the constituent particle.

It is important to note a relation of average value of an element of Gi with an element of Gi−1

where x can be average value of entropy, mass or thermal energy. Using eq.(7) for entropy into eq.(6) and after
iteration we get,

where sα

0 is the average of spatial entropy of the constituent particle whereas

N = 1 + N1 + N1N2 + .... +

Yi=1

It should be noted that the last term of N is the leading term. One can, however, ignore 1 in the expansion of N . It
follows from eq. (7)

where xn (= X) corresponds to average value of entropy, mass or thermal energy of the universe (i.e. Gn). In the last
equation, we have assumed that each Gi have equal number of Gi−1 elements. Using eq.(10) into eq.(8), we obtain
the spatial entropy of the universe.

Next we consider momentum space. The momentum distribution of accessible states for this system can be written

as [1]

Similarly

where mn−1 is the average mass of Gn−1

and un is the average kinetic energy of Gn.

Following the same procedure as of eq. (4), we can write

,

0 = (∆px)

3N1 and ∆px is the uncertainty in momentum of constituent particle. In quantum mechanics
where ∆V β
particles are treated as identical. As we reach smaller and smaller G’s, then we are ultimately in quantum regime.
Therefore a factor of N1! appears in the denominator of r.h.s of eq. (15) in order to avoid over counting of N1 momenta
[1].

We obtain entropy due to momentum distribution as

For large Nn [7]

Sβ =

the universe, Nn is the number of top most clusters (say the number of superclusters in the universe) which makes
the universe and N1 is the number of particles in the bottom cluster (say the number of nucleons in a star). In the
last equation we have omitted the indices α and n over the spatial volume of the universe.

IV. CONCLUSION

where P is pressure and T is temperature. From eq. (20) and eq. (21), we get

This is the generalized average kinetic/thermal energy for an ideal gas. From eq. (20) and eq. (22)

This is the generalized equation of state for an ideal gas.

To check validity of our system of equations, the ideal gas equations for molecules/particles must be deduced from
eqs. (23, 24). These equations can be obtained, if we take n = 1 as a special.case. In this case Nn = Nt = N , where
N is the number of particles in a gas. Moreover we ﬁnd that for such a system N = 1, which can be neglected as
compare to Nt in the denominator of r.h.s. of eq. (23). We ﬁnally get

The last two equations give us the average thermal energy and the equation of state for an ideal gas respectively.

We have considered all scales staring from sub-atomic to super-cluster and beyond. We obtain generalized ideal
gas equations that are applicable to molecules, stars, galaxies and the universe by itself. Our model is independent
of the shape and size of the intermediate clusters. We conﬁned ourselves to non-relativistic regime.

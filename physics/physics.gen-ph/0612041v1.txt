A detailed re-examination of the seminal paper on special relativity, taking into
account recent work on the physical interpretation of the space-time Lorentz trans-
formation as well as the modern understanding of classical elecromagnetism as a
certain limit of the fundamental underlying theory –quantum electrodynamics– is
presented. Many errors both of physical principle and of a mathematical nature are
uncovered. The ‘relativity of simultaneity’ and ‘length contraction’ eﬀects predicted
in the paper are shown to be the spurious consequences of misinterpretations of the
second postulate and the Lorentz transformation, respectively. The derivation of
the latter in the paper is shown to be ﬂawed. In this case, and other instances, due
to cancellation of mistakes, a correct result is obtained in a fallacious manner. Sep-
arate lists of the correct and incorrect predictions of the paper are given. Due to the
unique and revolutionary nature of its epistemological approach (the use of ‘thought
experiments’ and axiomatic derivations) and the experimentally veriﬁed predictions
of time-dilatation and mass-energy equivalence the fundamental importance of the
paper for the development of physics is little aﬀected by the many mathematical
errors and (to modern eyes) physical misconceptions that it contains.

Introduction

The present paper is intended as a companion to another paper on space-time physics [1]
by the present author where it is attempted to construct the theory of ﬂat 1 space-time
on the basis of simpler and more evident axioms than hitherto. When this is done, it is
seen that certain predictions of standard Special Relativity Theory (SRT) – in particular
‘relativity of simultaneity’ of two supposedly synchronised, spatially separated, clocks in
the same inertial frame and the associated ‘length contraction’ eﬀect, derived by Einstein
as a consequence of the Lorentz Transformation, in the seminal 1905 paper on SRT [2],
are spurious 2. They result from confusion between arbitary clock oﬀsets, completely
controlled by the experimenter, and physical time intervals observed in diﬀerent frames,
completely controlled by the Lorentz transformation. As well as in Ref. [1], how this come
about is explained in a series of earlier papers [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. It is also explained, in
the present paper, in the commentary on Einstein’s analysis of the thought experiments
where such eﬀects were ﬁrst introduced.

The motivation for writing the present paper is quite clear. As it is claimed that some
results of Einstein’s original 1905 paper, which have since been propagated unchanged
through several generations of text books, as well as the pedagogical literature 3 during
the last century, are wrong, it is mandatory to explain just where, and for what reason,
these conclusions of Einstein are incorrect.

The corrections to the interpretation of SRT result also in many changes in text-book
formulae of classical elecromagnetism, all dating from well before the advent of SRT.
These formulae, many of which occur in Einstein’s original SRT paper, are referred to
below under the acronym ‘CEM’ for Classical Electro-Magnetism, to be distinguished
from the recent classical electrodynamic theory [11], of the present author, which is fully
consistent with both SRT and, in the appropriate limit, with Quantum Electro-Dynamics
(QED). This theory is referred to below as ‘RCED’ for Relativistic Classical Electro-
Dynamics. The salient points concerning RCED are summarised below in the present
section, while some detailed diﬀerences with CEM will become evident to the reader in
the discussion of the ‘Electrodynamical Part’ of Ref. [2]. These diﬀerences, as well as
others, are also discussed in Refs. [12, 13, 14].

The century since Einstein’s original paper on special relativity was written has seen
an enormous increase in the understanding of physics. Perhaps the qualitatively most
important discovery of 20th Century physics, and the one with the most important prac-
tical ramiﬁcations was that matter (and anti-matter) can be created and destroyed. The
realisation that this was possible followed directly from the concept of the equivalence of

1That is, for cases in which all gravitational eﬀects may be neglected.
2It is important to notice that the relativity of simultaneity eﬀect discussed by Einstein in Ref. [2]
and also a popular book. [3], although, as will be shown below in Section 4, spurious, is not the same as
the ‘text book’ relativity of simultaneity eﬀect derived from a misapplication of the space-time Lorentz
transformation, described in Section 7 below. The source of the relativity of simultaneity eﬀect of
Refs. [2, 3] is more a consequence of a wrong understanding of the operational meaning of Einstein’s
second postulate of SRT, than of that of the Lorentz transformation.

Journal of Physics.

mass and energy introduced in Ref. [2]. The matter that is created or destroyed consists
of elementary particles, the detailed properties of which have been revealed by a fruitful
symbiosis between experiment and theory in the domain of ‘High Energy Physics’ in the
second half of the 20th Century. By a historical quirk, the theory that describes the
creation and destruction of elementary particles is called ‘Quantum Field Theory’ (QFT)
to distinguish it from ‘Quantum Mechanics’(QM) in which matter exists permanently.

Indeed, as formulated by Feynman, the original and most successful QFT, QED [15]
born of the marriage of QM with SRT, and describing the creation and destruction of real
or virtual photons and electrically charged elementary particles, has, as its fundamental
concepts, not ‘ﬁelds’ but the particles (which are what exist) and probability amplitudes
Indeed these are
that describe the histories, in space time, of these existing particles.
both the minimal and suﬃcient concepts to obtain all predictions of QED.

The most revolutionary conceptual discovery of 20th Century physics, apart from the
modiﬁcation of the concept of time required by SRT, at the basis of relativistic kinematics,
is that of QM and QFT. Our best current fundamental knowledge is that the world
is described in a probabilisitic fashion by these theories. The ‘classical’ physics of the
19th Century and earlier ones is given by certain limits of this quantum description,
typically those where the number of elementary particles involved is very large or where
the kinematical properties of objects are such that their corresponding mechanical action
is much larger than Planck’s constant h.

The above preamble is relevant to the subsequent discussion of Ref. [2] because of the
crucial role of CEM in Einstein’s formulation of SRT, in the paper with the title ‘On the
Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies’. Much of the material in even modern text books
on CEM is still presented in terms of 19th Century concepts, and, as already mentioned,
many standard formulae of the subject pre-date the discovery of SRT. It will be found
that several of the electrodynamic problems discussed by Einstein in [2] can be most easily
(and always, unlike in some of Einstein’s analyses, correctly) analysed in the language of
‘CEM as a limit of QED’. i.e. by introducing the photon concept, invented in the same
year in an earlier paper [16] by Einstein as the ‘light quantum’, but never used in the
SRT paper.

In a series of related papers, the present author has explored two related topics:

(i) What can knowledge of CEM teach about QM?

(ii) What can knowledge of QED teach about CEM?

The question (i) was addressed in a paper in which the comparison by ‘inverse corre-
spondence’ of a plane, monochromatic, electromagnetic wave with the equivalent mono-
energtic, parallel, beam of real photons, provides a simple understanding of many key
concepts of QM [17]. The question (ii) was considered for the particular case of inter-
charge forces, mediated by the exchange of virtual photons, in the absence of real photon
radiation, in Ref. [11].

The elementary QED process underlying, say the magnetic force between two current-

laws of physics do not change between the situation in which just two electrons scatter
from each other, or when the conduction electrons in one wire interact with those in
another. This can be considered as an application of Newton’s third rule of reasoning in
philosophy [18]

‘The qualitities of bodies, which admit neither intension nor remission of degrees,
and which are found to belong to all bodies within the reach of our experiments are to
estimated as the universal properties of all bodies whatsoever.’

In the present case, the word ‘bodies’ in this statement should be replaced by ‘elec-
trons’. Two electrons in free space, whose fundamental mutual interaction is described by
the Møller scattering amplitude, are the same as, and have the same mutual interaction
as, the conduction electrons in a wire. There is no reason to believe that this interaction
is modiﬁed, in any way, when the interacting electrons are separated by macroscopic dis-
tances. At lowest order, the QED momentum-space invariant amplitude for Møller scat-
tering involves the exchange of a single, space-like, virtual photon. Fourier transforming
this amplitude, expressed in terms of momenta in the overall centre-of-mass (CM) system,
into space time, demonstrates the instantaeous, not retarded, nature of the inter-charge
interaction [11]. This is also evident from the relativistic velocity formula v = pc2/E to
be discussed below in Section 13. In the CM frame the energy, but not the momentum,
of the virtual photon vanishes so that its velocity, v, is inﬁnite.

If a force is transmitted by istotropic emission and subsequent absorption of particles,
the inverse square law is a simple consequence of conservation of the number of transmitted
particles between the processes of emission and absorption. For large, space-like, intervals
∆s, the Lorentz-invariant Feynman propagator of the corresponding space-like virtual
c2(∆t)2 =
particle, of pole mass m, is
i∆s. Therefore, for space-like intervals with ∆x > ∆t, the propagator does not vanish

as predicted by ‘causality’ (see Section 13 below) but is instead exponentially damped

damping does not occur, so that conservation of the number of virtual particles predicts
that the corresponding exchange force law is inverse square. In this way, both Coulomb’s
inverse square law and the instantanteous nature of the intercharge force are ﬁrst-principle
predictions by QED.

An explicit relativistic formula for the inter-charge force in RCED (Eqn(3.4) below)
has been obtained in Ref. [11] from the three postulates: an instantaneous Coulomb Law
force in the non-relativistic limit, special relativistic invariance and Hamilton’s Principle.
A Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian for two interacting charges is constructed from the space-
time and velocity 4-vectors of the two charges by imposing consistency with the well-
known Lagrangian for the two-body central-force problem in the non-relativistic limit [20].
A logical ‘concept-ﬂow’ diagram of the derivation is shown in Fig.1. All essential physics is
contained in the six upper boxes, surrounded by the dot-dashed line. It is obtained without
the introduction of any ‘force’ or ‘ﬁeld’ concept. However, as shown by the boxes outside
the dot-dashed line, all the concepts and laws of CEM developed during the 19th Century
are derived by simple mathematical substitutions, either in the invariant Lagrangian or
in the intercharge force equation. It is interesting to compare Fig.1 with the concept-ﬂow
diagram of Fig.2 which shows the logical development of the ideas of CEM during the

3

19th Century. The theoretical starting points here are the phenomenological concepts
of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, introduced by Faraday and Maxwell and operationally
deﬁned in terms of forces exerted on a test charge. These are the concepts in terms
of which Einstein originally formulated SRT. Note the similarity between Fig.2 and the
bottom half, below the dot-dashed line, of Fig.1. However all the ‘Empirical Laws’ and
‘Classical Theoretical Predictions’ of Fig.2, with the exception of ‘E M waves’, are included
in the single box ‘Intercharge Force’ of Fig.1.

The RCED predictions of Ref. [11]for the electric ﬁeld of a uniformly moving charge
and its associated magnetic ﬁeld, Eqns(9.19) and (9.20) below do not agree with the pre-
relativistic Heaviside formulae [21]. This has important consequences for the discussion
of the formulae in the ‘Electrodynamical Part’ of Ref [2]. As will be discussed in Section
3 below, the Heaviside formula has been demonstrated to be erroneous by calculating the
electromagnetic induction eﬀect produced by a simple two-charge ‘magnet’ in diﬀerent
reference frames [13]. Also, in Ref. [14], it is shown that there is an important mathemat-
ical error in the derivation if the retarded Li´enard-Wiechert [22] potentials from which the
‘present time’ Heaviside formula for the retarded ﬁelds may be obtained. That is, it is not
only that the intercharge force is instantaneous, not retarded, but also that the Heaviside
formula does not even correctly describe a hypothetical retarded intercharge force.

In Ref. [11] the simplest possible system –just two interacting charges was considered.
However in the ‘Electrodynamic Part’ of Ref. [2], the electric and magnetic ﬁelds intro-
duced exist a priori and nowhere is there any discussion of how they are produced. As
aleady pointed out in Ref [14] this has important consequences both on the very nature,
in a mathematical sense, of the electromagnetic ﬁelds, as well as their transformation
laws and the status of their relativistic covariance in the presence of interactions. This
important point is discussed in some detail in Section 9 below.

Also, in common with most authors of text books on CEM, Einstein makes no distinc-
tion between the ‘force ﬁelds’ which correspond to the ‘Intercharge Forces’ of Fig.1 and
‘Electric Forces’, ‘Magnetic Forces’ and ‘E M Induction’ of Fig.3 and, ‘radiation ﬁelds’,
not considered Fig.1, and describing ‘E M Waves’ in Fig.2, using identical mathematical
symbols to describe them both. Actually the operational meanings of the two types of
ﬁelds are quite distinct [23, 11, 14]. This diﬀerence will be taken into account in the
discussion of the various sections of the ‘Electrodynamic Part’ of Ref. [2].

Turning now to the ‘Kinematical Part’ of Ref. [2] it is clear that Einstein’s presentation
of SRT results in a strong entanglement (in the common, not the quantum mechanical
technical sense) of concepts from space-time physics and CEM. In Fig.3 is shown a concept
ﬂow diagram of the Larmor-Lorentz [24, 25] 4 and Einstein derivations of the LT and of
Voigt’s derivation of his earlier, and closely related5 transformation [28]. Of particular
importance for Einstein’s formulation of SRT is the light-signal synchronisation procedure
for spatially separated clocks, that assumes spatial isotropy of the speed of light. Relaxing

4It is diﬃcult to understand why Larmor’s work, published in 1900, was not cited in Lorentz’ 1904
paper where identical transformation equations were given.The appellation ‘Lorentz Transformation’ is
due to Poincar´e [26]. See Ref. [27] for a discussion of priority issues related to the discovery of the Lorentz
Transformation.

the latter postulate leads to the ‘conventionality’ of clock synchronisation by this method,
a subject on which a vast literature exists [29].

However, applying Ockham’s razor to the derivation of the LT, in a similar way to
that in which it was applied to CEM in Ref. [11] to obtain RCED, is there, in fact,
any necessary connection between SRT and CEM? It was realised very early that the
answer to this question is ‘No’. Of particular importance in this context is the 1910
paper of Ignatowsky [30] in which the necessary existence of a limiting relative velocity,
V , between any two inertial frames was pointed out. Indeed, a very extensive literature
on ‘lightless’ derivations of the LT exists. See Ref. [31] for citations of work prior to
1968, and the paper published some years ago by the present author [32] giving later
citations, and in which the one-dimensional LT was derived from just two postulates,
Single-Valuedness(SV) and the Measurement Reciprocity Postulate (MRP):

SV: Each Lorentz transformation equation must be a single-valued function of its argu-

ments.

MRP: Reciprocal space-time measurements of similar rulers and clocks at rest in two dif-
ferent inertial frames: S,S’ by observers at rest in S’,S, respectively, give identical
results.

Another, much shorter, derivation can be found in Ref. [33] based on the postulates SV
and Space-Time Exchange Invariance (STEI):

STEI: The equations describing physical laws are invariant with respect to the exchange
of space and time coordinates, or more generally, with respect to the exchange of
spatial and temporal components of 4-vectors.

In order to derive the full three-dimensional LT the additional postulate of spatial isotropy
is required in both cases. In the derivation from SV and the MRP the limiting velocity
V appears naturally in the course of the derivation, as was the case in Ref. [30]. In the
one based on SV and STEI the universal parameter, V , with the dimensions of velocity,
must be introduced, for dimensional reasons, in order to deﬁne the space-time exchange
operation, that requires unidimensional space and time coordinates. The concept ﬂow
diagram of the LT derivations of Refs. [32, 33] in Fig.4 may be compared with that in
Fig.3. No appeal is made to CEM, or any other dynamical theory. As discussed below,
Einstein’s second postulate of the constancy of the speed of light is derived (see Fig.4) from
relativistic kinematics and the massless nature of the photon [32]. The LT derivations of
Refs. [32, 33] are recalled in the Appendix of Ref. [1].

In Ref. [1], several clock synchronisation procedures, not making any use of light signals
are introduced. The crucial point (as clearly stated by Einstein himself, although never
correctly applied by him, or by anyone else) is that, as will be shown in the following
section, the space-time LT describes, fundamentally, how times recorded by clocks in
uniform motion appear to a ‘stationary’ observer. If there are several such synchronised
clocks in the same moving inertial frame, at diﬀerent spatial positions, suitable constants
must be added, for each such clock, to the right sides of the equations of the conventional

5

space time LT. The latter describes correctly only a synchronised clock at the origin of
the moving frame. Until now, this has not been done, resulting, as described previously
in Refs
[1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], in the spurious ‘relativity of simultaneity’ (RS) and
‘length contraction’ (LC) eﬀects of conventional SRT. As described in Refs. [6, 7] there
is indeed a genuine relativity of simultaneity eﬀect in SRT for clocks in diﬀerent inertial
frames. However, there is no associated ‘length contraction’ eﬀect. Spatial coordinate
transformations are same for the Galilean and Lorentz transformations.

The following section contains, for the reader’s convenience, a brief summary of the
correct physical interpretation of the space-time LT given in Refs. [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10]. In the subsequent sections the spurious arguments by which Einstein arrived at the
predictions of RS and LC are examined in detail. Sections 3-13 contain commentaries
on
10 of Ref. [2]. Section 14 contains a summary that includes a list of Einstein’s
§
mistakes, and the concluding Section 15 discusses the legacy of the 1905 special relativity
paper in the light of both the ﬁndings of the present reassessement and its historical
context.

Since Einstein did not number the equations of Ref. [2] (there are

140 in the paper)
a complete numbered list is presented, section-by-section, in the Appendix. They are
numbered with an ‘E’ in correspondence with the numbered sections of Ref. [2]. e.g.,
(E10.2) is the second equation of
10. Although all the equations in the Appendix are
§
fair copies of those in the English translation of Ref. [2], in places the notation has been
(v/c)2
changed to be more in conformity with modern usage. For example γ for 1/
and β for v/c, as well as 3-vector notation for components of electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
Also, depending on what is most convenient, in some places Einstein’s original notation
for space-time coordinates, and in others that of Section 2 below, will be employed. The
only ambiguous symbol is τ which stands, in Einstein’s notation, for the apparent time
of clocks in the ‘moving’ frame S’ as viewed from the ‘stationary’ frame S, and in the
notation of Section 2 for the proper time of clocks at rest in S as viewed in this frame.
Forewarned of this, the reader should not be too confused by the use of the two diﬀerent
nomenclatures. For clarity, the most important E-numbered equations are repeated in the
text at the appropriate place. All other equations are numbered according to the section
of the present paper in which they occur.

The space-time LT connects observations of the same space time event in diﬀerent
inertial frames. If the frame S’ moves with speed v along the x-axis of the frame S, and
if the Cartesian axes of the frames are parallel, the LT is written as:

To give an operational meaning to the time coordinates it is necessary to introduce
clocks; say C in S and C’ in S’. The time symbols in the LT are then identiﬁed with the
readings of these clocks. The LT can then describe two diﬀerent experiments:

(i) C’ (in motion) is viewed from S

(ii) C (in motion) is viewed from S’

The appropriate x-t LT equations to describe these two possiblities are, for experiment

Note that (2.7) and (2.8) are not simply the inverse transformation of (2.5) and (2.6) but
four diﬀerent time symbols appear in the equations with diﬀerent operational meanings:

Also four diﬀerent space coordinates: x(C), x(C′), x′(C) and x′(C′) occur. Inspection of
(2.5) and (2.6) shows that t′ = τ = 0 when x = x′ = 0. This means, operationally, that
the clocks C and C’ are synchronised (set to zero) at the instant that the clock C’ at
x′ = 0 is at the x-origin in S. If it is now desired to synchronise, in a similar manner, the
clocks C and C’ when C’ is at x′ = L, and its x coordinate in S is also L, the equations
(2.5) and (2.6) require modiﬁcation. As correctly pointed out by Einstein [34]:

If no assumption whatever be made as to the initial position of the moving

system and as the the zero point of τ , (t′ in the notation used above)an additive
constant is to be placed on the right side of each of these (the LT (2.1)-(2.4))
equations.

Equations (2.17) and(2.18) give the complete space-time description of the clock C’ at

become clear in the following sections of the present paper where Einstein’s predictions
of these eﬀects are critically examined.

It will become apparent in the following discussion of Ref. [2] that Einstein did not
take into account the existence of the four operationally distinct time symbols appearing
in the LTs (2.5)-(2.8). All discussions are based on (2.1) and (2.2) where t is identiﬁed
with the proper time in S and t′ with the proper time in S’. This is equivalent to making
τ ′ in Eqn(2.6). That this is a logical
the substitutions t
absurdity becomes evident on making the same substitutions in (2.18) and (2.20) leading
to the equations:

These equations require that γ2 = 1 or v = 0, in contradiction to the initial hypothesis
that the the velocity, v, of S’ relative to S, is non-vanishing.

In some applications it is convenient to introduce an alternative notation for the

apparent time intervals t′ and t:

Here, τ ′(C′), for example, is a proper time interval recorded by the clock C’, at rest in
S’, and observed in this frame. This is to be contrasted with τ ′ in Eqn(2.16) that is,
instead, the proper time interval in S’ corresponding to the observation of the apparent
time interval t of a clock at rest in S, but observed from S’. Use of the symbols τ , τ ′.
t and t′ has the advantage that they all represent direct observations of time intervals
of clocks, either at rest (τ , τ ′), or in motion (t,t′). Since these times are the same for
all synchronised clocks in the frames, no clock labels are necessary. If (2.29) and (2.30)
are used, all symbols specify proper times but additional clock labels are required to
distinguish, for example, τ and τ (C).

An important application of (2.29) occurs in particle physics where the clock C’is

3 Einstein’s Introduction: The physics of electro-
magnetic induction in diﬀerent reference frames

In the introductory section of Ref. [2] Einstein discusses the phenomenon of electro-
magnetic induction in two reference frames: the ﬁrst in which a magnet is in motion and
a test charge is at rest, and the second in which the magnet is at rest and the test charge
in motion. For the present discussion, the test charge can be conveniently considered
to be at rest in the frame S’, while S is the magnet rest frame. Einstein states that in
the ﬁrst case an electric ﬁeld acts on the test charge, but did not attempt to calculate
this ﬁeld. As shown below, if he had, he might have obtained a very surprising result!
In the case that the magnet is at rest and the test charge in motion, the latter moves
in a inhomogeeous but static magnetic ﬁeld and is subjected a transverse Lorentz force
which, in this case, explains the induction eﬀect. Einstein states that, in this second
case, ‘no electric ﬁeld occurs in the neighbourhood of the magnet’. Later in Ref. [2], after
discussing the transformation laws of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, it is pointed out that
the magnetic (Lorentz) force in one frame (that in which the test charge is in motion)
becomes an electric force in the frame in which the test charge is at rest, as a direct con-
sequence of the transformation laws of electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Thus the magnetic
and electric forces are just the descriptions in diﬀerent frames of the force on the test
charge responsible for electromagnetic induction. The two separate phenomena discussed
by Einstein are thus uniﬁed in special relativity by the transformation laws of electric and
magnetic ﬁelds. However, explicit calculation of the force on the test charge in the two
cases, using standard formulae of CEM, will now be shown to lead to a less satisfactory
conclusion.

Consider a test charge, q, near an elementary ‘magnet’ consisting of two charges of
magnitude Q situated, at some instant, at the points U and D (See Fig.5). The points
U and D lie along the y axis equidistant from the origin, whereas the charge q lies in the
x-y plane displaced, by a small distance, from the x-axis. Fig.5a corresponds to the rest
frame of the magnet (frame S). The charges at U and D move parallel to the positive and
negative z axes, respectively, with speed u. The velocity vectors of the charges are ~uU
and ~uD. The test charge moves with speed v in the positive x-direction. An imaginary
rectangular contour, abcd, parallel to the y-z plane moves together with the test charge.
Fig.5a corresponds to the second case considered by Einstein –stationary magnet and test
charge in motion. Because of the displacement of the test charge from the symmetry axis,
Ox, there is a net magnetic ﬁeld component parallel to the y-axis. The corresponding
Lorentz force is in the direction of the negative z-axis and explains the induction eﬀect

in the rest frame of the magnet.

U and ~u′

In Fig.5b is shown the corresponding conﬁguration in the frame S’ where the test
charge is at rest and the magnet moves with speed v along the negative x′-axis. The
D of the charges at U and D are now at an angle α to the z′-axis
velocity vectors ~u′
u + γ2β2 and βu = u/c. Since the test charge is at rest
β2
where sin α = β/βu′ = γβ/
there is no Lorentz force, so, as pointed out by Einstein, electromagnetic induction can be
produced in this frame only by an electric ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld vectors ~EU and ~ED, at
the point where the plane abcd cuts the x′-axis, are shown as predicted by the Heaviside
formula [21] for the electric ﬁeld of a uniformly moving charge:

(3.1)

The radius vector ~r is that from the source charge to the ﬁeld point (so the electric ﬁeld is
predicted to be radial) and ψ′ is the angle between the radius vector and the source charge
velocity vector ~u′. Because of the radial character of the electric ﬁeld, the vectors ~EU and
~ED associated with the source charges U and D, lie in the x′-y′ plane at every point in
this plane, including that at the position of the test charge. There is therefore no electric
ﬁeld in the z′-direction, and so, according to Eqn(3.1), no electromagnetic induction eﬀect
in the frame S’. The Heaviside Formula (3.1) is therefore inconsistent with SRT for the
conﬁguration of moving charges shown in Fig.5.

In the recent paper by the present author [11], mentioned in the Introduction, a

diﬀerent formula to (3.1) for the electric ﬁeld of a moving charge was obtained:

where ˆu′ is a unit vector parallel to the source charge velocity and ˆt′ is a unit vector
perpendicular to ˆu′ and lies in the plane deﬁned by ˆu′ and the radius vector ~r specifying
the ﬁeld point, on the same side as the ﬁeld point. The electric ﬁeld deﬁned by (3.2) is not
radial and calculation [13] in the frame S’ shows agreement at O(β2) 6 with the induction
eﬀect calculated in the frame S, either by explicitly evaluating the Lorentz force in this
frame, or by use of the integral form of the Faraday-Lenz Law in either S or S’. .

It is interesting to note, in connection with the previous remark, that the problem of
the apparent inconsistency of the description of induction in diﬀerent frames, posed by
Einstein, does not arise if the integral form of the Faraday-Lenz law:

is used to solve the problem. In Fig.5a, the ﬂux φ of magnetic ﬁeld threading the contour
abcd changes because the contour moves in a static, but non-uniform, magnetic ﬁeld,
whereas in Fig.5b, the contour is stationary but φ changes because of the motion of the
magnet. Typically, in text books, it is pointed out that the Faraday-Lenz law can be used

force diﬀers between the frames S and S’ by terms of O(β4) and higher.

to derive electromagnetic induction in either the frame S or S’, whereas a fundamental dy-
namical understanding (the Lorentz force) is available only in the frame S. This situation
provoked the following statement by Feynman [35]:

We know of no other place in physics where such a simple and accurate

rule as the combined effects of two quite separate phenomena. (Italics in the
original).

The ‘separate phenomena’ referred to are the Lorentz force law and the Faraday-Lenz
law (3.3). In fact a completely uniﬁed description of electromagnetic induction as well all
the other mechanical eﬀects7 of classical electromagnetism is provided by the following
formula [11] containing no ﬁelds, that gives the force on a test charge due to a source
charge in arbitary motion:

Here q and ~βc are the charge and velocity of the test charge of Newtonian mass m

Q(γuc, γu~u) is the 4-vector current of
the source charge. The uniﬁed description of of electromagnetic induction provided by
Eqn(3.4) would no doubt have pleased both Einstein and Feynman. As discussed in
Ref. [11] ‘the single deep underlying principle’ underlying Eqn(3.4) is the Feynman path
integral formulation of quantum mechanics, applied to space-like virtual photon exchange
processes, in the classical (h
0) limit. This is the fundamental ‘constructive physics’
underlying both the Coulomb force law and Hamilton’s Principle, from which Eqn(3.4) is
derived.

It has been pointed out in Ref. [14] that there is an important mathematical error in
the derivation of the Li´enard-Wiechert retarded potentials [22] from which the ‘present
time’ Heaviside formula (3.1) is obtained. When this error is corrected then, up to an
overall multiplicative factor, the formula (3.2) (but with a retarded time argument) is
recovered.

After the discussion of electromagnetic induction, Einstein introduces the postulates
on which his analysis of space-time physics is based: The Relativity Principle and the
postulate that the speed of light does not depend upon that of the emitting body. Here,
and later when explicitly deﬁning this postulate it is not stated that the speed of light as
measured in any inertial frame is constant. Einstein refers only to the ‘stationary’ frame
S. Also, in the introduction, the Relativity Principle is applied only to the description
of electromagnetic and optical phenomena in diﬀerent reference frames. In accordance
with the title, it is stated that the aim of the paper is to provide ‘a simple and consistent
theory of the electodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell’s theory of stationary

In the ﬁnal paragraph of the introduction, Einstein stresses the importance of actual
measurements of length intervals with rulers, and time intervals with clocks, in construct-
ing the theory. This is certainly a very important remark. However, as shown in Ref. [1],
the consideration of electromagnetic and optical pheonomena, as in Einstein’s paper, is
inessential to establish the foundations of space time physics in ﬂat space, which are the
space-time LT and its correct physical interpretation. The last sentence of the introduc-
tion is:

Insufficient consideration of these circumstances (i.e. actual, experimental,
space and time measurements) lies at the root of the difficulties which the
electrodynamics of moving bodies at present encounters.

As will be demonstrated below, this sentence remains valid one century after the work
presented in Ref. [2] if the words ‘the physics of space time’ are substituted for ‘the
electrodynamics of moving bodies’ in the sentence just quoted.

§1. Deﬁnition of Simultaneity

At the beginning of this section, Einstein stresses again the importance of actual clock
readings and the concept of simultaneous events in establishing the meaning of physical
time:

We have to take into account that all our judgements in which time plays

a part are always judgements of simultaneous events. If, for instance, I say
‘‘That train arrives here at 7 o’clock’’, I mean something like this:
‘‘The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the
train are simultaneous events’’.

What Einstein is stating here is that any actual time measurement (and therefore
any measurement of a time interval) is built up from pointer-mark coincidences, which
constitute the irreducible experimental raw data, and the concept of simultaneity. In the
above example two, simultaneous, pointer-mark coincidences (between the hand of the
clock and a mark on its dial, and between the front of the train and the position on a
platform of Bern railway station where Einstein happened to be standing) are involved.
In a similar way the raw experimental data of data of any spatial measurement involves,
or is equivalent to, the spatial coincidence of a pointer speciﬁed by the geometry of some
physical object and a mark on a ruler. A mathematically rigorous calculus of such pointer-
mark coincidences in constructing measurement of space and time intervals is developed
by the present author in Ref. [1].

Einstein then addresses the problem of establishing the simultaneity of spatially sepa-
rated events in a given reference frame, and proposes the light-signal clock synchronisation
procedure of Eqns(E1.1) and (E1.2). This procedure immediately couples the concept of
In particular, Einstein’s deﬁnition
simultaneity with the physics of light propagation.

13

of simultaneity (or equivalently of clock synchronisation) assumes spatial isotopy of the
speed of light. However, as shown in Ref. [1] it is perfectly possible to synchronise spatially
separated clocks without using light signals, and so independently of the assumption of
light-speed isotropy. Two such procedures:
‘Pointer Transport’ and ‘Length Transport’
are described in Ref. [1]. Pointer Transport can be used to synchronise an arbitary number
of spatially-separated clocks in the same reference frame, whereas Length Transport syn-
chronises four clocks, two in each of two diﬀerent inertial frames. Given the isotropy of the
speed of light, Einstein’s light-signal synchronisation procedure is, of course, a perfectly
valid one. However applications of this idea to the discussion of the relativity of length
and time intervals and the derivation of the LT in subsequent sections of Ref. [2] lead to
serious errors of interpretation of the physical meaning of Einstein’s second postulate.

§2. On the Relativity of Lengths and Times

At the begining of this section Einstein restates his initial postulates8 of special rela-

tivity:

1.

The laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are

not affected whether these changes of state be referred to one or the other
of two systems of coordinates in uniform translatory motion.

2.Any ray of light moves in the ‘‘stationary’’ system of coordinates with
the determined velocity, c, whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or a
moving body.

Hence:

velocity =

= c

where ‘time interval’ is to be taken in the sense of the definition in
19.
§

Postulate 1 applies equally in classical (Newtonian) mechanics and was well known to
both Galileo and to Newton. The postulate 2 was introduced, for the ﬁrst time, by Einstein
and is the basis of his formulation SRT. The above statement of this postulate refers only
to Einstein’s ‘stationary’ coordinate system (S in the notation of the present paper). It
is only when the relation (E2.1) is further assumed to hold in an arbitary inertial frame
that its highly non-intuitive nature becomes evident. The latter was discussed in some
detail in Einstein’s later popular book on relativity [3]. However, it is quite unnecessary
to introduce Eqn(E2.1) as a stand-alone postulate. Given that light consists of massless
particles, photons (for the discovery of which, in another paper [16], published earlier in
1905, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize) Postulate 2 follows directly from relativistic
kinematics [32]. The deﬁnitions of the relativistic energy and momentum of a physical

Hence, any massless particle has the velocity v = c in any inertial reference frame. This
is exactly the relation (E2.1), not only in the ‘stationary’, but in any inertial reference
frame. The kinematical relations (5.1)-(5.3) are derived and discussed for the case of a
object subject to electromagnetic forces in Section 13 below.

After describing carefully and correctly how the length of a measuring rod is deﬁned
both in the frame S’, in which it is rest, and that, S, in which it is in uniform motion,
Einstein introduces a thought experiment based on the light signal clock synchronisation
procedure (LSCSP) introduced in the previous section. This experiment is purported to
give a direct demonstration of ‘relativity of simultaneity’ (RS):

We imagine further that at the two ends A and B of the rod, clocks are
placed which synchronise with clocks of the stationary system, that is to say
that their indications correpond at any instant to the ‘‘time in the
stationary system’’ at the places that the happen to be.
therefore ‘‘synchronous in the stationary system.

These clocks are

We imagine further that with each clock there is a moving observer and
1
§

that these observers apply to both clocks the criterion established in
for the synchronisation of two clocks.

The clocks are situated at the ends of the rod and so are at rest in S’. It follows from
the TD formula (2.18) that these clocks must be running faster than a clock at rest in S by
the factor γ in order to remain synchronous with it. It is clear however from the discussion
of Section 2 above, in particular Eqn(2.26), that these clocks must also be synchronous
for an observer in S’. Einstein states just the contrary. Why? In fact Einstein does not
discuss the LSCSP in the frame S’ but instead considers a series of events deﬁned in, and
observed from, the frame S:

Let a ray of light depart from A at the time tA where ‘time’ here denotes
‘time of the stationary system’ and also ‘position of the hands of the moving
clock situated at the place under discussion’.

the clocks to be synchronous.

is false. This is because the events observed in S appearing in Eqns(E2.2) and (E2.3)
are not the Lorentz-transformed LSCSP events deﬁned in the frame S’. These latter events
as observed either in S ’ or S, as well as the events in S considered by Einstein are shown
in Table 1 and Fig.6.

It is assumed that, in addition to the mirror, M’, at B, there are also light detectors
(not shown) at A and B connected to the lamps LA and LB which ﬂash when photons are
detected near A and B. For example, in Fig.6a, LA ﬂashes when the light signal is close to
A. The ﬂashes of the lamps are visible to observers in both S and S’ and so establish the
correspondence between the same event seen in the two frames. Events as observed in the
frame S’ are shown on the left side of Fig.6, the same events, as observed in S, on the right
side. Figs.6a, 6b and 6d show the events of the light signal synchronisation procedure as
performed in the frame S’, while Figs.6a, 6c and 6e show the events considered by Einstein
in the frame S. In the frame S, the light signal is reﬂected from the mirror M that is in
spatial coincidence with M’ at the instant of reﬂection in S (Fig.6c, right).

Inspection of Table 1 and Fig.6 shows that there is no correlation between the events
introduced by Einstein in the frame S, with times calculated according to the relations
(E2.2) and (E2.3) and the clock synchronisation events in the frame S’. The times indicated
in Fig.6 are the proper times, as recorded by identical clocks, in these frames. The clocks
at A and B introduced by Einstein, that are synchronous with a clock in S, record times:
τ ′
B = γτ ′ where τ ′ is the proper time in S’ as recorded by a clock identical to the
A = τ ′
one in S. Using Einstein’s notation of (E1.1) for the times of events in S’ (that is, setting,
here, τ ′ = t) the events shown in Table 1 and Fig.6 give:

It is clear however, from the very concept of Einstein’s synchronisation procedure that
both the photon source and the mirror must be at rest in some frame. Only then is the
tB for the events shown
relation (E2.1) valid. The diﬀerence between tB −
in Figs.6c and 6e has a trivial, and purely classical, explanation. The relative velocity of
the light signal and the mirror M’, as observed in S, is c
v before reﬂection and c + v
after reﬂection, whereas formula (E2.1), which is the basis of Einstein’s synchronisation
procedure requires the ‘light path’ to be ﬁxed in some frame, not in motion, as is the case
for equations (E2.2) and (E2.3). There is confusion here between the ‘relative velocity’
between a moving object and a light signal as observed in some frame, which can be
greater of less than c, and the ‘speed of light’, deﬁned by (E2.1), which is the constant c
in any inertial frame.

A misinterpretation, similar to that, just described, of Eqns(E1.1), (E1.2) and (E2.1)
occurs in Einstein’s analysis of his well-known train/embankment thought experiment [36].
This point is discussed at length in Ref. [7].

Einstein mentions ‘relativity of length’ in the title of this section and makes the state-
ment that a moving rod will be measured to have a diﬀerent length from a stationary
one. However no arguments are given to support this assertion, or mention made of the
following

§3. Theory of the Transformation of Co-ordinates
and Times from a Stationary System to another
System in Uniform Motion of Translation Relative
to the Former

In this section Einstein’s notation for space-time coordinates is retained. However, as
is now conventional, Einstein’s frames K, k are denoted, as above, by S, S’ respectively. An
event as observed in S, S’ then has space-time coordinates (x,y,z,t), (ξ,η,ζ,τ ) respectively.

Einstein’s derivation of the LT is based on the LSCSP introduced in

1. However,
§
the same false connection between events in the frames S and S’ is assumed as in the
discussion of relativity of simultaneity in
2. In spite of this, Einstein does succeed to
§
derive the correct LT, at least the one appropriate to a synchronised clock situated at
the origin of S’. Einstein assumes that the LT is linear in the space-time coordinates and
seeks ﬁrst to derive the time transformation equation. It would seem natural to assume
the functional dependence τ = τ (x, y, z, t) for this equation. Einstein however does not
do this. It is assumed instead that τ = τ (x′, y, z, t) where:

x′

≡

−

x

vt = x(t = 0) = constant

(E3.1)

even though the ﬁnal result (E3.7) has the functional dependence τ = τ (x, t). This, unlike
the initial ansatz, does depend on x, (as it should), whereas the x′ dependence (which
must also be there) has been lost. How this comes about is explained below. Actually,
for synchronised clocks, the time transformation (Eqn(2.18), in Einstein’s notation ):

τ = t/γ

(6.1)

depends on neither x′ nor x.
It would seem however to be impossible to derive this
equation by assuming simply τ = τ (t) as an ansatz. Actually, (6.1) has been derived
by combining (2.15) and (2.16). The latter equation has the functional dependence (in
Einstein’s notation) of τ = τ (x′, x, t) as it must have in order to correctly describe syn-
chronised clocks with diﬀerent values of x′. Note that in (2.15) and (2.16) Einstein’s
constant x′ is L. Einstein’s neglect of the essential x dependence of the LT in his initial
ansatz is the ﬁrst error in his derivation. Other, compensating, errors enable the correct
transformation to be ﬁnally obtained.

Einstein next considers a light signal emitted from the origin of S’; parallel to the ξ
axis, that is reﬂected straight back by a mirror, and observed again at the origin of S’.
This is just the sequence of events shown in Figs.6a, 6b, and 6d for which the space-time
coordinates in the two frames are presented in the ﬁrst, second and fourth rows of Table
1. However Einstein assumes, following the argument presented in
2, that the reﬂection
§
event in S’ is that shown in Fig.6c and the third row of Table 1, while the return-to-origin
event in S is that in Fig5e and the ﬁfth row of Table 1.

The LSCSP relation (E3.2) that is the basis of Einstein’s derivation of the LT will now
be discussed, ﬁrst inserting into it the correct times and positions in the frames S and S’
from Table 1, and then, following Einstein’s argument, with the functional dependence

18

τ = τ (x′, y, z, t), and assuming that the corresponding events in S are those in the third
and ﬁfth rows of Table 1.

Since the light signals have y = η = z = ζ = 0, the corresponding time transformation
equation has, in general, the functional dependence τ = τ (x′, x, t). The LSCSP relation
in the frame S’:

2

[τA + τ ′

gives, noting that (see Fig.6) x′ = 0 for the clock at A and x′ = L for the clock at B:

(ii) Subsitution of incorrect corresponding events in the frame S in the LSCSP relation.

When the correct events in S are substituted into Eqn(6.2),(as in Eqn(6.4)), and the
necessary x-dependence of the transformation is taken into account, the spurious relativity

The correct LT (E3.27)-(E3.30) for a synchronised clock at A has now been derived by
misapplication of Eqns(E3.14),(E3.15) to the clock at B, for which, lacking the required x′
(or L) dependence of (2.15) and (2.16), they are not valid, and, in parallel, misinterpreting
the meaning of Einstein’s postulate 2, by assigning incorrect events in S in correspondence
with the LSCSP events in S’ (see Fig.6). It is interesting to note here that Einstein knew
that the LT must depend explicitly on x′ both because of the initial ansatz τ = τ (x′, y, z, t)
and the explicit statement [34] concerning the necessary additional additive constants on
the right sides of (E3.14)-(E3.17), noted in Section 2 above. However, by omitting the
x-dependence of τ in the initial ansatz, the LT for the clock at B (with x′ = L) was found
to be the one that is actually valid for the clock at A (where x′ = 0) and so does not
correctly describe a synchronised clock at B. Such synchronised clocks actually exhibit
the universal TD eﬀect of Eqn(2.18). Afterwards, in the applications of the LT in Ref. [2],
the missing x′ dependence of the ﬁnal LT equations (E3.27)-(E3.30) is forgotten11, leading
to the prediction, as will be seen below, of a spurious ‘length contraction’ eﬀect in

§4. Physical Meaning of the Equations Obtained
In Respect to Moving Rigid Bodies and Moving
Clocks

Einstein ﬁrst considers a rigid sphere of radius R at rest in S’ with its centre at the

origin. The equation of this sphere is

ξ2 + η2 + ζ 2 = R2

(E4.1)

Setting t = 0 in the LT (E3.27)-(E3.30) and using it to eliminate ξ, η and ζ in favour of
x, y and z in Eqn(4.1) gives the equation:

x2
(v/c)2 + y2 + z2 = R2

(E4.2)

1

−

which represents an ellipsoid of revolution. This however does not correctly describe the
moving sphere as seen from S, since the LT (E3.27)-(E3.30) appropriate for ξ = 0 (the
center of the sphere) has been also used to transform points on the surface of the sphere
where it is no longer applicable.

Introducing spherical coordinates θ, φ the coordinates of an arbitary point P on the

sphere are:

ξ = R sin θ cos φ
η = R sin θ sin φ
ζ = R cos θ

(7.1)
(7.2)
(7.3)

(7.4)
(7.5)
(7.6)
(7.7)

(7.8)

Assume that a clock, situated at the point P, is synchronised with a clock in S so that
τ = t = 0 when the center of the sphere is at the origin of coordinates in S. The LT
giving the corresponding space-time coordinates in S is given, in Einstein’s notation by
Eqns(2.15), (2.16), (2.3) and(2.4) as:

ξ

−

τ = γ(t
R sin θ cos φ = γ[x

−
η = R sin θ sin φ = y
ζ = R cos θ = z

Combining (E4.1), (7.5), (7.6) and (7.7) the surface observed in S at time t is therefore:

vt)2 + y2 + z2 = R2

(x

−

which is a sphere centered at x = vt. There is no therefore no shortening of the x-
dimension when it is viewed from from the frame S, as claimed by Einstein.

Einstein’s error is to use the LT (E3.27)-(E3.30), that correctly describes a synchro-
nised clock (i.e. one for which τ = 0 when t = 0) at the origin of S’, that is the center of
the sphere, incorrectly to describe a synchronised clock at the point P on the surface of
the sphere. At t = 0 Eqn(E3.27) gives

τP =

R sin θ cos φ

(7.9)

22

The time in S’ varies with the position of P so that clearly (E3.27) does not describe a
synchronised clock at P. The operation of clock synchronisation is a purely mechanical or
electronic one, entirely under the control of the experimenter and independent of space-
time physics. For example, clocks at diﬀerent positions on the sphere can be synchronised
by signals sent along equal-length cables connected to the centre of the sphere. When the
latter coincides with the origin in S a triggering system sends synchronous signals along
each cable to start the clocks, which each have an initial time oﬀset to compensate for
the signal delays [1]. Since the LT (E3.27)-(E3.30) does not describe such a synchronised
clock, the length contraction eﬀect of Eqn(E4.2) is spurious. For further discusssion of
this important point See Refs. [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

The most important, and correct, conclusion of Ref [2] concerning space-time physics is
the time dilatation formula (E4.5) which is derived in an identical manner to Eqn(2.18) in
Section 2 above. Note that, unlike for the discussion of length contraction, the derivation
of the TD formula is not dependent on the value assigned to Einstein’s parameter x′ =
x(t = 0) (L in Eqns(2.15) and (2.16)). It is indeed precisely assigning incorrect values of
x′ to clocks on the surface of the sphere that results in the spurious prediction of length
contraction.

After deriving the TD formula (6.1) Einstein discusses observations of times recorded
by stationary or moving clocks. The case when a moving clock starts at the same position
as the stationary one, moves along a curve (Einstein considers this curve as the limit of a
polygonal line) is now referred to as the ‘Twin Paradox’ [37] –less time has elapsed during
the round trip according to observations of the moving clock as compared to the stationary
one. However Einstein only considers one moving clock (say C’) and one stationary one
(say C). Since the TD eﬀect depends only on the relative velocity of the two clocks, the
clock C will also appear to be running slow to an observer moving with C’. In order
to demonstrate a genuine asymmetric aging eﬀect clocks must be compared in the same
reference frame before and after a round trip. In this case the eﬀects of acceleration on
one (or both) of the clocks must be taken into account. This was not done by Einstein in
Ref. [2].

Einstein concludes

4 with the statement:
§

Thence we conclude that a balance-clock (Not a pendulum clock which is

physically a system to which the Earth belongs.

precisely similar clock situated at one of the poles under otherwise
identical conditions.

at the equator must go more slowly, by a small amount, than a

This case had to be

The correctness of the phrase ‘go more slowly’ depends on the frame from which the
clock is being observed. Greater clarity would be obtained by replacing ‘go more slowly’
with ‘appears to go more slowly when observed from the frame F than when it is observed
in its own rest frame’. The question then arises: what are the frames F for which this
statement is true? Einstein speciﬁes an observer at a pole of the Earth and a clock at the
equator. However since what is relevant for TD is the relative velocity of the two clocks,
the clock at the pole would also be observed to be running slow by an observer at the
equator.

23

Only special relativistic eﬀects were considered by Einstein in Ref. [2]. In fact, due
to the rotation of the Earth, its surface bulges outward at the equator, which places
an observer there at a higher gravitational potential12 than one at the pole.
It turns
out [38, 39] that, for example, for an atomic clock, the increase of frequency of equator
clock photons observed at the pole due to gravitational blue shift exactly compensates
the TD eﬀect for an observer at a pole. In the case of a clock at the pole observed from
the equator the gravitational red shift reinforces the TD eﬀect to double the apparent
slowing-down eﬀect of the clock. For a distant observer moving with the Earth, both
clocks will appear retarded as compared to an identical local clock at rest due the the
greater gravitational red shift in this case, but only the clock at the equator will be
additionally retarded due to the TD eﬀect resulting from the rotation of the Earth. For a
distant observer, rotating around the Earth with the same angular velocity as the latter,
only the gravitational red shift aﬀects the observed rates of both the polar and equatorial
clocks. These diﬀerent examples show clearly that the changes in the rates of clocks in
motion, or in gravitational ﬁelds, are apparent (i.e observer dependent) not ‘real’ eﬀects.
It is strictly analogous to the eﬀects of linear perspective in visual perception. Distant
objects appear to be smaller, but their true size does not change. Similarly, the rates of
clocks, in motion or subjected to gravity, appear to change, but their true rates (that is,
those observed in the rest frames of the clocks) do not change.

Einstein’s exclusion from consideration of pendulum clocks in the English translation
of Ref. [2] means that he must have later considered the importance of gravitational
eﬀects: if not already gravitational frequency shifts, at least the dependence of the period
of a pendulum on the size of the ambient gravitational ﬁeld.

§5. The Composition of Velocities

Einstein derived the composition laws for longitudinal and transverse velocity compo-

nents by simple substitution of the relations:

ξ = ωξτ,

η = ωητ,

ζ = 0

(E5.1)

in the LT equations (E3.27)-(E3.30). This leads immediately to the relations:

x =

(ωξ + v)t
1 + vωξ
c2

(E5.2)

1
−
y = ωηt q
1 + vωξ
c2

(v/c)2

(E5.3)

Specialising to the case of motion in S’ parallel to the ξ-axis (i.e. ωη = 0) and setting
x = V t (E5.2) yields the parallel velocity addition relation (PVAR)

where

12The gravitational potential is deﬁned to be negative and to vanish at inﬁnity

V =

v + ω
1 + vω
c2

(E5.9)

ω2 = ω2

ξ + ω2

η

(E5.6)

24

Einstein derived the PVAR directly from the LT, but this relation may also be obtained
assuming only Einstein’s second postulate [40, 41] or, alternatively, by assuming that V
is a single-valued function of v and ω and using the Reciprocity Principle [32].

The PVAR really involves three inertial frames S, S’ and S0 where the last is the
proper frame of the moving object. Even so, Einstein’s derivation uses only the LT
(E3.27)-(E3.30) connecting the frames S and S’. To understand the operational meaning
of the symbols used in this derivation it is convenient to revert to the notation af Section
2. The observer in the thought experiment corresponding to the derivation of the PVAR
is at rest in the frame S and the PVAR gives the velocity of the object relative to this
observer, V , in the case that that the velocity of the object relative to an observer at rest
in the frame S’ is ω. The appropriate LT is therefore (2.15) and (2.16) with L = 0 and

where the equivalence of Eqn(2.29) between the apparent time interval t’(S) and a proper
time interval τ ′(C′) has been used. In these equations, whereas τ is a proper time recorded
by a clock at rest in S, t′(S) is the apparent time of a clock at rest in S’ as viewed from
S. The ratio of (8.1) to (8.2) is:

which gives, after rearrangement, (E5.9).

If t0(S) is the apparent time of a clock at rest in S0 (i.e.

in the proper frame of the

moving object), as viewed from S, the TD relation for an observer in the frame S is:

while that for an observer in the frame S’ is:

§6. Transformation of the Maxwell-Hertz Equa-
tions for Empty Space. On the Nature of the Elec-
tromotive Forces in a Magnetic Field During Mo-

In the ﬁrst part of this section Einstein derives the transformation laws for electric
and magnetic ﬁelds in ‘empty space’ from the assumed covariance of Maxwell’s equations
obtaining the well-known results, in modern notation and Gaussian units:

§

As will be seen shortly, a certain tacit asumption concerning the nature of electric and
magnetic ﬁelds underlies the transformation equations (E6.13)-(E6.15). To understand
this assumption it will be found convenient to write the transformation equations in tensor
notation. To render the equations more transparent the notation of Section 2 for space-
time coordinates in the frame S’ (x′,y′,z′,t′) instead of Einstein’s (ξ,η,ζ,τ ) is used. The
electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F αβ is deﬁned by the equations:

With this notation the transformation laws (F6.13)-(E6.15) are all subsumed in the single
tensor equation:

∂x′α
∂xγ
where repeated upper and lower indices are summed over 0,1,2 and 3. In (9.7) the values
of the partial derivatives are derived from the inﬁnitesimal LT between the frames S and

dy′ = dy,

The values of the partial derivatives in (9.7) that give the transformation laws (E6.13)-
(E6.15) require a certain assumption, concerning the space-time functional dependence
of the ﬁelds, that will now be discussed. This assumption is that all components of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds are ‘classical’ ones in the sense that all space-time coordinates
may be considered to be independent variables. If this is the case, then the chain rule of
diﬀerential calculus is valid for for any generic ﬁeld component F [42]:

The transformation law between ∂α and ∂′α is found by using the inverse equations of
(9.8)-(9.10) to eliminate d~x and dx0 in favour of d~x′ and dx′0 in Eqn(9.11). Collecting
terms and equating the coeﬃcients of the three components of d~x′ and of dx′0 in the
second and third members of (9.11) gives, since the ﬁeld F is arbitary, the transformation
laws of the partial diﬀerential operators as:

These equations show that the partial derivatives transform as a 4-vector under the LT.
In virtue of the deﬁnitions (9.2) and (9.3) of F αβ and the 4-vector character of Aα, the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds then transform as a second rank tensor according to Eqn(9.7).

These coeﬃcients, when subsituted into (9.7) give exactly Einstein’s transformation laws
It is important to stress again that, in order derive (9.15)-(9.18) the
(E6.13)-(E6.15).
ﬁeld components F are required to respect the chain rule relation (9.11). This requires,
in particular, that the x-coordinate and the time must be independent variables.

In reality, however the force ﬁelds in ‘empty space’ considered by Einstein do not
exist. Since they are deﬁned by the force they exert on a test charge they can be non-zero
only if, in the problem, there is at least one source charge to produce the ﬁelds. The
space in the region of the test charge therefore cannot be ‘empty’. The simplest possible
electrodynamic system described by force ﬁelds therefore contains at least two electric
charges, one of which may be considered as the ‘source’ of the ﬁelds that act on the other
’test’ charge, although it is clear, from the symmetry of the system, that these roles may
be interchanged. Here the simplest case of a single source charge in uniform motion will
be considered. The corresponding electric and magnetic ﬁelds of pre-relativistic classical
electromagnetism (CEM) are given by the equations [21]:

whereas, in RCED, they are given by [11]:

axes. In (9.19)-(9.22) ~r is speciﬁed at the instant at which the ﬁelds are deﬁned, although
the Heaviside formula (9.19) is commonly derived [43] from retarded Li´enard-Wiechert
potentials [22]. As mentioned in Section 2 above, the pre-relativistic Heaviside formulae
(9.19), (19.20) are actually incorrect, but what is important for the present discussion
is only the functional space-time dependence of the ﬁelds in (9.19)-(9.22) and of the
corresponding 4-vector potential Aα in the deﬁning equations of the ﬁelds (9.2) and (9.3).
In all of these equations, the ﬁeld point, ~x, always appears in combination with the vector,
~xQ, specifying the instantaneous position of the source charge, to deﬁne the radius vector,
~r, giving the relative positions of the source and test charges:

When the source charge is in motion, the functional time dependence of the ﬁelds is
implicit in that of the source charge position ~xQ = ~xQ(t). Because Aα and all the ﬁelds

~r

~xQ

are functions of r =
it follows, for the case of Eqns(9.19)-(9.22) where the source
charge is in motion parallel to the x-axis, that x and t are no longer independent variables,
as assumed in Eqn(9.11), but instead their partial derivatives satisfy the relation [14]:

Also, as demonstrated in Ref. [14] r is a Lorentz-invariant quantity so that in virtue of
Eqns(9.14), and in contrast to Eqn(9.12), the transformation of the x partial derivative
is, like the y and z partial derivatives, time independent:

∂
∂x′ =
A consequence of (9.24) and (9.25) is that the x and t partial derivatives do not transform
as components of a 4-vector according to Eqns(9.12) and (9.13) so that the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds produced by a uniformly moving charge do not transform, according to
(9.7), as components of a second-rank tensor.

The actual transformation laws of the RCED ﬁelds of (9.21) and (9.22) are easily read
oﬀ from these equations. Denoting by ~E∗ the electric ﬁeld in the rest frame S∗ of the
source charge Q, (9.21) gives:

For comparison with Einstein’s transformation equations (E6.13)-(E6.15), suppose that
the velocity of the source charge in the frame S’ is w. Then (9.21) and (9.22) give, for the
ﬁelds in the frame S’:

Eqns(9.34) and (9.36) for the transformation of the transverse electric ﬁeld and the mag-
netic ﬁeld agree with the corresponding equations in (E6.14) and (E6.15). Although the
tensor transformation law is not valid, it gives, fortuitously, the correct transformation
laws for these ﬁelds. Since the transformation coeﬃcients of (9.34) and (9.36) depend only
on the relative velocity of the frames S and S’, and are independent of the velocity of the
source charge, these equations are covariant. It is otherwise with the transformation law
of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld in the ﬁrst of Eqns(9.30) which does not agree with Ein-
stein’s covariant transformation law in (E6.13), E′
x = Ex. In this case the transformation
coeﬃcient does depend on the velocity of the source charge. There is therefore a preferred
frame (the frame in which the source charge is at rest) in the problem. Because of this
relativistic covariance is broken. Fundamentally, the tacit assumption underlying Ein-
stein’s analysis, introduced into theoretical electromagnetism by Faraday and Maxwell,
that electric and magnetic forces may be correctly described by local classical ﬁelds is not
true of the actual force ﬁelds of a uniformly moving charge. This applies both to the
pre-relativity ﬁelds of Eqns(9.19) and (9.20) and the RCED ﬁelds of (9.21) and (9.22).
The actual force ﬁelds are produced by the source charge and the motion of this charge
aﬀects, instantaneously, the force experienced by the test charge. All inertial frames are
not equivalent, so that special relativistic invariance breaks down in the description of
inter-charge forces.

Another consequence of this breakdown of covariance is the frame dependence of some
of the Maxwell equations [14]. For example, the Amp`ere law equation in the ﬁrst of
Eqns(E6.1):

This is demonstrated by direct calculation of the partial derivatives of the ﬁelds of (9.21)
and (9.22), taking into account the relation (9.24) connecting the x and t partial deriva-
tives. A similar calculation of the y- and z-components of Amp`ere’s law show that the

ﬁrst equations of (E6.11) and (E6.12) remain valid. In contrast to the Amp`ere law all

valid for the RCED force ﬁelds of Eqns(9.21) and (9.22) and the CEM ﬁelds of (9.19) and
(9.20). This follows directly from the deﬁning equations of the ﬁelds in terms of Aα, (9.2)
and (9.3), written in 3-vector notation as:

The appearence of a similar covariance-breaking term in the Gauss law (9.41) and the

electric ﬁeld in Eqn(9.19) or (9.21) is conﬁned to the x-y plane, and only the z-component

As shown on Ref [14] the wave equations of all components of the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds derived from Eqns(9.21) and (9.22) are also modiﬁed by the addition of βu depen-
dent covariance-breaking terms, so that Maxwell’s derivation of ‘electromagnetic waves’
associated with these ﬁelds also breaks down. The leading covariance breaking terms in
Gauss’ law and the electric ﬁeld wave equations are of O(β4
u), and for the Amp`ere law and
the magnetic ﬁeld wave equations of O(β5
u), so that no practical applications of Maxwell’s
equations in the non-relativistic domain are aﬀected signiﬁcantly by these modiﬁcations.
However it is clear that the heretofore fundamental physical status of Maxwell’s equations

31

is profoundly modiﬁed by the the lack of covariance of the Amp`ere law and the Gauss’
law for electric ﬁelds.

In the second part of

6 Einstein returns to the general problem of the relationship
§
between electric and magnetic forces that was discussed for the special case of electro-
magnetic induction in the Introduction. Einstein’s remarks here are important, both for
what is said, and for what is left unsaid:

1.

If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic

field there acts upon it, in addition to the electric force, an
‘‘electromative force’’ which, if we neglect the terms multiplied by the
second and higher powers of v/c, is equal to the vector-product of the
velocity of the charge and the magnetic force divided by the velocity of
light.

(Old manner of expression).

2.

If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic

field, the force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is
present at the locality of the charge, and which we ascertain by
transformation of the field to a system of co-ordinates at rest relatively
to the electrical charge (New manner of expression).

The analogy holds for ‘‘electromotive forces’’.

We see that electromotive

force plays in the developed theory merely the part of an auxiliary concept
which owes its introduction to the circumstance that electric and magnet
forces do not exist independently of the state of motion of the system of
coordinates.

Furthermore it is clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the introduction
as arising when we consider the currents produced by the relative motion of
a magnet and a conductor now disappears.
‘‘seat’’ of electrodynamic electromotive forces (unipolar machines) now have
no point.

Moreover, questions as to the

Einstein clearly states here that the essential physical phenomenon is the force on the
test charge and that the electric and magnetic ‘ﬁelds’ serve only as labels for diﬀerent
terms in the force equation, the relative contributions of which vary according to the
inertial frame in which the force is evaluated. It is pointed out that the“electromotive
force” (Lorentz force due to motion in a magnetic ﬁeld) that acts on the test charge may
be annuled by transformation into the rest frame of the test charge, in which only the force
associated with the electric ﬁeld acts. Einstein later uses this argument in
10 to derive,
§
correctly to lowest order in β, the Lorentz force from the transformation laws of electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. Because it can be ‘transformed away’ in this manner the Lorentz
force (and by implication the ‘magnetic ﬁeld’ itself) is assigned the status of an ‘auxiliary
concept’. But by the same token the electric ﬁeld is also an ‘auxiliary concept’ in that it,
like the magnetic ﬁeld, is completly speciﬁed by the conﬁguration of electric charges that
constitute its source. Throughout Ref [2] Einstein discusses only ﬁelds and either their
interactions with test charges or the description they provide of electromagnetic radiation.
In what manner these ﬁelds are produced by their sources, which is essential for a complete
physical description, is not even mentioned. The covariance of Maxwell’s equations with

32

sources is discussed in
9 but not the physical interpretation of the ﬁelds and sources,
§
which, in their most important physical application, the description of radiation, is quite
diﬀerent to that of the force ﬁelds discussed in

6,
§

9 and
§

10.
§

In fact since all mechanical eﬀects on a test charge are described by Eqn(3.4) (or
by its generalistation to the case of multiple source charges) in which only the physi-
cal parameters specifying the spatial and kinematical conﬁguration of the source charges
appear, both the electric and magnetic ‘ﬁelds’, that serve only as labels for the diﬀer-
ent terms on the right side of (3.4), are inessential ‘auxiliary concepts’, or alternatively,
‘mathematical abstractions’. The same is true of the 4-vector potential, Aα, in terms of
which, electric and magnetic ﬁelds are deﬁned by Eqns(9.2) and (9.3). This, in turn, is
unambiguously speciﬁed 13 by the physical parameters that describe the conﬁguration of
source charges [11]. This is shown in Fig.1. All force predictions are contained in the ‘In-
tercharge Force; box inside the dot-dashed line. They are obtained without the necessity
to introduce any ‘ﬁeld’ concept whatever.

At the end of

6, Einstein returns to the problem of induction, as analysed in diﬀerent
§
inertial frames discussed in the Introduction and considers it solved by the comments in
the paragraphs 1. and 2. cited above. If he had actually calculated the electric ﬁeld in
the rest frame of the test charge for the conﬁguration shown in Fig.1b, using the then-
available Heaviside equation with a radial electric ﬁeld he would have found, as explained
in Section 2 above, that the induction force is not the same as the Lorentz force in Fig5a,
but actually vanishes! As described in [13] consistent results in the two frames are given
by the RCED formulae (9.21) and (9.22). The calculation shows that the induction force
is, however, not exactly equal in the frames S and S’, but diﬀers by terms of O(β4
u). The
origin of this diﬀerence is the source velocity dependence of the electric ﬁeld in Eqn(9.21),
which breaks covariance for the longitudinal component of the electric ﬁeld.

The closing remark of

6 concerns the absence, in electromagnetism, of magnetic

10 §7. Theory of Doppler’s Principle and Aberration

Einstein ﬁrst writes down in Eqns(E7.1)-(E7.3) the ﬁeld components, in the frame S,
of an electromagnetic wave propagating in the direction deﬁned by the direction cosines
l, m, n relative to the x, y, z axes. The phase of the wave in S is written as:

Eqn(3.4) is derived. Thus there is no freedom of the choice of gauge used to deﬁne Aα in RCED.

At this point there is a logical hiatus in the discussion. Einstein immediately writes
down the transformation equations giving the quantities ω′, l′, m′ and n′ in terms of ω, l,

The ﬁeld components are also transformed into the frame S’ in Eqn(E7.5)-(E7.7), but the
actual values of the ﬁeld components are irrelevant for the discussion of the Doppler eﬀect
and aberration in this section.

In order to derive (E7.9)-(E7.12) another important hypothesis, not mentioned by
Einstein, is needed: Φ′ = Φ. That is, it must be assumed that the phase of the wave is a
Lorentz invariant quantity. Presumably Einstein did this, used the LT (E3.27)-(E3.30) to
replace τ , ξ, η and ζ in (E7.8) by t, x, y and z, and equating coeﬃcients of these variables
in the thus-transformed Eqn(E7.8) with those in Eqn(E7.4) arrived (after some algebraic
manipulation) at Eqns(E7.9)-(E7.12). This method does yield the correct Doppler eﬀect
and aberration formulae, but, as discussed below, poses a certain problem of mathematical
logic.

From a modern viewpoint The postulate of the invariance of Φ and the fact that
(ω/c; ωl/c, ωm/c, , ωn/c) must also

(ct = x0; x, y, z) is a 4-vector, implies that Ω

X
be a 4-vector so that (E7.4) may be written as:

Where factors 1/c on both sides of (10.5)-(10.8) have been divided out. Eqn(10.5) is
identical to (E7.9) and yields (E7.11) and (E7.12) on eliminating ω/ω′ from (10.7) and

The problem of mathematical logic in Einstein’s surmised proof of Eqns(E7.9)-(E7.12)
arises from the factor in curly brackets in (E7.4). The quantity lx+my +nz is a rotational
invariant that has the value:

The distance s is the displacement of the wave front (i.e. a surface of constant phase) in
its direction of propagation during the time t. Thus, (E7.4) may be written as:

Since the wave front moves at speed c, s = ct and (10.10) gives Φ = 0. Since the ﬁeld
components in Eqns(E7.1)-(E7.3) are all proportional to sin Φ they all vanish identically.
So Einstein’s electromagnetic wave (as deﬁned) does not exist! In a similar way, (E7.8)
may be written as:

Since, by the second postulate, the wave front also moves at speed c in S’, s′ = cτ and
Φ′ = 0. Thus (10.10) and (10.11) reduce to the equation:

φ = ω

0 = ω′

0 = φ′

×

×

which is true for any ﬁnite values of ω and ω′. This would seem to indicate that Einstein’s
presumed derivation of (E7.9)-(E7.12) by (tacitly) setting Φ equal to Φ′, and Lorentz
transforming one set of space-time coordinates, was a mathematically hazardous enterprise
that ﬁnally ‘fell on its feet’ !

At the end of

The quantities A and A′ are called ‘the amplitudes of the electric or magnetic force’
which shows some confusion over the physical meaning of the ﬁeld components in (E7.1)-
(E7.3) and (E7.5)-(E7.7). These are radiation ﬁelds, not force ﬁelds. The squares of these
radiation ﬁelds give the energy density ρE in the electromagnetic wave according to the
well-known formula:

ρE =

( ~E2 + ~B2)

1
8π

(10.13)

→

As pointed out above, as deﬁned, Eqns(E7.1)-(E7.3) and Eqns(E7.5)-(E7.7) imply A =
A′ = 0. This problem is removed by making the permissible substitutions sin Φ
cos Φ
and sin Φ′
cos Φ′ in these equations. However, (E7.17) and (E7.18) derived from the
transformation of force ﬁelds in Eqns(E7.6) and (E7.7) still make no sense physically.
This can be seen by noting that a ‘plane electromagnetic wave’ is in fact a beam of
monochromatic photons [17]. The transformation of the energy density of the wave may
therefore be derived from the relativistic kinematics of photons. Since the energy density
A2 is the product of the photon energy Eγ and the photon number density nγ,
ρE ≃

→

35

which is Lorentz invariant, the transformation law of ρE may be derived from that of the
photon energy. This gives, instead of (E7.17) and (E7.18):

Notice that the transformation law of the the photon energy, and hence of the energy den-
sity of the beam, is the same as that of the photon frequency in Eqns(E7.13) and (E7.14)
not that of the square of the force ﬁelds in Eqns(E7.6) and (E7.7). This is a consequence
of the Planck-Einstein relation, Eγ = hνγ, to be further discussed in the following sec-
tion. Einstein’s error in deriving Eqns(E7.17) and (E7.18) is the misidentiﬁcation of force
ﬁelds, describing the eﬀects of space-like virtual photon exchange between electric charges,
with the radiation ﬁelds appropriate to the description of the monochromatic beams of
real photons, which manifest the Doppler eﬀect and aberration. The distinction between
radiation ﬁelds and force ﬁelds is further discussed in Section 12 below.

Einstein’s ﬁnal statement in

7 :
§

It follows from these results that to an observer approaching the source

of light with velocity c, this source of light must appear of infinite
intensity.

remains true according to (10.15). although the approach to ‘inﬁnite intensity’ is less

rapid than in Eqn(E7.18).

11 §8. Transformation of the Energy of Light Rays.
Theory of the Pressure of Radiation Exerted on
Perfect Reﬂectors

In this section Einstein discusses, ﬁrstly, the transformation law of the energy density
of an electromagnetic wave and, secondly, the radiation pressure due to a plane electro-
magnetic wave at oblique incidence on a uniformly moving plane mirror. Since plane
electromagnetic waves may be identiﬁed with a parallel beam of monochromatic photons,
all the results of this section may, alternatively, be obtained in a simple and transparent
manner by invoking the relativistic kinematics of real photons.

To obtain the energy transformaton law of a ‘light ray’ Einstein considers a ‘ a spherical

surface in the frame S with the equation:

(x

lct)2 + (y

mct)2 + (z

nct)2 = R2

This equation represents a sphere of radius R centered at x = lct, y = mct, z = nct. The
center moves in the same direction and at the same speed as the plane wave considered in
7. Even though the plane wave is of inﬁnite extent in all three dimensions, Einstein con-
§
siders only the energy of the ‘light complex’ (Lichtcomplexe) inside the spherical surface.

36

The spurious ‘length contraction’ in the direction of motion of the spherical surface in S
as viewed from S’ according to (E4.2) is now invoked to claim that the surface (E8.1), as
observed in S’ at τ = 0 is:

This equation, which does correctly describe the tansformation law of the energy density
of an electromagnetic wave, as in Eqn(10.14) above, has been obtained by combining the
incorrect formula for the transformation of the energy density (E7.17) with the spurious
length contraction eﬀect in (E8.2). A factor γ(1
β cos φ) cancels to give the correct
transformation law for a ‘light ray’ identiﬁed with a ‘light complex’.

−

The above calculation has deﬁned a ‘light complex’ as a spherical region inside an
inﬁnite plane electromagnetic wave in the frame S, which is then transformed into the
frame S’. However, from the Reciprocity Principle of special relativity [32] such a spherical
‘light complex’ can equally well be deﬁned for the electromagnetic wave in the frame S’.
Viewed from the frame S, by the same argument leading from (E8.1) to (E8.2), it will
appear as an ellipsoid of revolution with volume V related to the volume of the sphere in
S’, V ′ by Eqn(8.3) with V and V ′ interchanged. The transformtion law of the energy of this
‘light complex’ is then diﬀerent to (E8.4) and inconsistent with that, (10.14), obtained
from photon kinematics. The logical footing of this manifestly incorrect calculation is
identical to that used by Einstein to derive (E8.4). That the latter describes correctly the
transformation of the energy density of an electromagnetic wave is purely fortuitous.

Since the photon number density, nγ, is Lorentz invariant, the relation (E8.4) is most
simply obtained by transformation of unidimensional photon energy-momentum 4-vector:

pγ ≡

(Eγ; (Eγ/c) cos φ, (Eγ/c) sin φ, 0)

(11.1)

according to the space-time symmetric LT (10.3). After the derivation, by a fallacious
argument, of the correct Eqn(E8.4), Einstein makes the following important remark:

It is remarkable that the energy and the frequency of a light complex
vary with the state of motion of the observer in accordance with the same
law.

In a paper written earlier in 1905 [16], Einstein had introduced into physics the concept
of the ‘light quantum’ –light as a particle, later to be called the photon. However, at the

37

time of writing the special relativity paper Einstein was not yet aware of the formalism of
relativistic kinematics, to be developed somewhat later by Planck [46], and so could not
have been known of the simple kinematical derivation of (E8.4) provided by the photon
concept. Had he done so, he may have realised a deep and important connection between
the light quantum and special relativity papers, that is, ultimately, one between quantum
mechanics and special relativity. In fact, in the spirit of Einsten’s remark just quoted,

This is the Planck-Einstein relation.
If Einstein had had more conﬁdence, in 1905, in
the reality of photons the equations (E7.13) and (E8.4) might have lead to an indepen-
dent discovery of Planck’s constant and the associated fundamental quantum mechanical
equation (11.2).

As discussed in Ref. [17], a more detailed comparison of plane electromagnetic waves
with the equivalent photonic description enables other important quantum mechanical
formulae and concepts to be understood as consistency conditions on the wave and particle
representations of the same phenomenon.

The photonic description enables a simple and direct calculation of radiation pressure.
The photon ﬂux per unit area per unit time, fγ, of a beam with angle of incidence φ on a
mirror moving away from the beam with velocity v in the direction normal to its surface
is:

where nγ is the photon number density. The momentum transfer, per photon, perpendic-
ular to the surface of the mirror is:

To understand how Einstein nevertheless obtained the correct result (11.6) by using
the incorrect energy density of the reﬂected wave, given by (E8.12), it is necessary to
examine in more detail the calculation presented. The energy ﬂux per unit area per unit
time, fE, incident on the mirror is:

fE =

A2(c cos φ

(E8.15)

The derivation of this formula is demonstrated in Fig.7a. A portion of the plane wave (or,
equivalently, of a monochromatic, parallel, photon beam) of dimensions ∆y = ∆z = a
is incident on the plane mirror moving with velocity v along the x-axis. It can be seen
from the geometry of this ﬁgure that the number of photons crossing the mirror during
the time interval t is:

N IN

γ = nγaArea(ABCD) = nγa2(c cos φ

since nγEγ = ρE = A2/8π, in agreement with (E8.15). The outgoing energy ﬂux is given
by Einstein as:

fE′′′ =

(A′′′)2(

c cos φ′′′ + v)

−

(E8.16)

This formula is derived from the geometry of Fig.7b. However, the photon ﬂux considered
in this ﬁgure is evidently not that of the reﬂected beam (the number of photons reﬂected
must be equal to the number of photons incident on the mirror) but rather is that of a
beam of the same size and in the same direction as the reﬂected beam but incident behind
the mirror! Indeed it is found from the geometry of Fig.7b that:

which yields (E8.16) for the energy ﬂux. The photon number density must be the same
for the incident and reﬂected beams (the reﬂection process changes only the kinematical
prameters of the photons, not their number). However, it is clear from (11.9) and (11.11)
. In Fig.3, φ = 30◦, and v = 0.25c so that

(E7.17), and the absurd geometrical analysis of the reﬂected wave shown in (Fig.7b).

It remains that Einstein’s ﬁnal remark in this section is of great importance for the

eﬀective application of special relativity to physical problems.

All problems in the optics of moving bodies can be solved by the method
What is essential is, that the electric and magnetic force

of light which is influenced by a moving body be transformed into the system
of co-ordinates at rest relatively to the body.
in the optics of moving bodies will be reduced to a series of problems in
the optics of stationary bodies.

By this means all problems

The essential idea here, that physical problems are solved in the most elegant way
by choosing the reference frame in which the description is simplest, and then using
relativistic transformations to obtain predictions in the frame of interest, has applications
extending far beyond ‘the optics of moving bodies’. A related idea is to express physical
equations, in any conveniently chosen frame, in terms of Lorentz-invariant quantities, to
obtain an equation valid in all inertial reference frames [47, 11].

tions when Convection-Currents are Taken into
Account

In this section the notation of Section 9 will be adopted, i.e. (x′,y′,z′,t′) will be used
for space-time coordinates in S’ rather than Einstein’s (ξ,η,ζ,τ ). Also a ﬁeld point in
the xy-plane is considered where the source charge moves parallel to the x-axis. This
choice of coordinates entails no loss of generality and much simpliﬁes the equations since
~Ez = ~Bx = ~By = 0. Also the substitution ρ = 4πρQ is made in Einstein’s equations to
obtain the conventional charge density ρQ in Gaussian units. In this case (E9.1)-(E9.11)

In these equations the force ﬁelds are speciﬁed at the space point (x,y,0). In general the
source charge density ρQ is an arbitary function of the coordinate (xS,yS,zS) specifying an
element of the source. For deﬁnitinessr, this is specialised to the case of a single point-like
source charge in uniform motion, where the charge density ρ∗
Q in the rest frame S∗ of the
charge is:

ρ∗
Q(~xS) = Qδ(~xS −
where ~xQ is the position vector of the source charge Q. In RCED and QED the force
ﬁelds and the charge density are speciﬁed at the same time, so that the intercharge force
is instantaneous, not retarded [11].

Given that the ‘empty space’ Maxwell equations of

6 already describe the electric
§
and magnetic force ﬁelds at ‘source free’ ﬁeld points in an identical manner to the ‘with
source’ equations of the present section it is perhaps worthwhile to ask what additional
physics information is provided by the latter set of equations? There are two answers to
this question, the ﬁrst ﬁrst concerning predictions for the force ﬁelds and the second the
description of of radiative processes where real photons are created.

The operational meaning of the force ﬁelds is provided by the Lorentz equation (9.1) in
terms of the force on a test charge. The Maxwell equations contain spatial and temporal
partial derivatives of these ﬁelds. What additional information is provided by these ﬁrst-
order partial diﬀerential equations? The answer, insofar as the force ﬁelds are concerned,
is not at all clear. In fact predictions of electromagnetic forces are typically extracted
from Maxwell’s equations by invoking the corresponding integral relations, which, in a
certain sense, annul the partial derivatives:

(12.8)

(12.9)

In highly symmetrical conﬁgurations these integral relations provide a simple manner
to calculate the ﬁelds and hence, by use of the Lorentz equation, the physical predic-
tion, which is the force on a test charge. For example Coulomb’s inverse square force
law for a point charge may be derived from (12.7) [48] and the magnetic ﬁeld due to an
inﬁnite straight conductor from (12.8). Eqn(12.9) gives directly the induction force on
conduction electrons in a circular coil. However, all the intercharge forces of electrody-
namics are described by the single formula (3.4) in which no ‘ﬁelds’ appear and no Lorentz
equation must be invoked. Maxwell’s equations, including their covariance-breaking rel-
ativistic corrections, are all found en route to the derivation of Eqn(3.4) [11, 14] (see
Fig.1). Electric and magnetic force ﬁelds, although of tremendous historical importance
and phenomenological utility, do not provide the most economical and fundamental de-
scription of electromagnetic forces. This is given by quantum electrodynamics, in which

42

the underlying quantum mechanical mechanism is the exchange between electric charges
of space-like virtual photons [11].

The second application of Maxwell’s equations with sources concerns an entirely dif-
ferent process: the production and propagation of real photons, associated, in classical
electrodynamics, with accelerated electric charges. In common with essentially all text
book authors Einstein did not distingish between force ﬁelds (eﬀects of virtual photon ex-
change) and radiation ﬁelds (creation propagation and destruction of real photons) using
identical symbols for the diﬀerent types of ﬁelds and referring in the text to the ‘force’
of the radiation ﬁelds discussed in
8. This is not the place to describe in detail
§
how Maxwell’s equations with sources are used to calculate radiation ﬂuxes. This is done
in all advanced text books on classical electromagnetism. Only the essential steps are
reviewed, and in view of the incorrect transformation law of the energy density of an
electromagnetic wave (E7.17) given by Einstein the (lack of) covariance of the ‘radiation
ﬁelds’ will be commented on

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the Gauss and Amp`ere laws (E9.4A) and (E9.1A)
are replaced by the derivatives of the 4-vector potential Aα according to the deﬁning
equations (9.2) and (9.3) to yield second order partial diﬀerential equations in components
of Aα. The Lorenz condition:

1
c
is then used to obtain separate second-order partial diﬀerential equations (d’Alembert
Equations) for ~A and A0. Solving these equations by the Green’s function technique
and calculating the correponding retarded electric and magnetic ﬁelds, using (9.2) and
(9.3), terms with both 1/r2 and 1/r dependence are obtained. Terms of the second type,
associated with source charge acceleration, are identiﬁed as radiation ﬁelds. Making the
non-relativisic approximation that the maximum source-charge velocity is much less than
c, and using the Poynting vector to calculate the energy ﬂux, the rate of real photon
radiation in, for example, dipole radiation is predicted, in good agreement both with
experiment and, in the appropriate limit with the corresponding quantum mechanical
calculation [14]. At very large distances from the source, the radiation ﬁeld, denoted by
Einstein as A, has the same operational meaning as the probability amplitude to observe
a photon at the corresponding spatial position [14, 17]. The physical interpretation of
the radiation ﬁeld is therefore quite diﬀerent from that of force ﬁelds which are quite
unrelated to the real photon degrees of freedom.

It is interesting to note that the Lorenz condition (12.10) is an identity for the instanta-
neous force-ﬁeld 4-vector potential, being a consequence of the relation (9.24) connecting
temporal and spatial partial derivatives [11]. Nevertheless its introduction is essential for
the derivation of the retarded potential associated with the radiation ﬁelds,

It was found above in Section 10 that the force ﬁelds of Eqns(E7.1)-(E7.3) and
(E7.5)-(E7.7) naively identiﬁed as radiation ﬁelds gave the incorrect transformation laws
(E7.17),(E7.18) for the energy density of a plane electromagnetic wave. Another example
of the inadequacy of classical electromagnetic ﬁelds to give a correct relativistic descrip-
tion of real photon processes is discussed in Ref. [14]. Although radiation ﬁelds derived
from Maxwell’s equations, as outlined above, give a correct description of dipole radiation
in the non-relativistic limit of source charge motion, this is no longer true if the ﬁelds are

43

boosted from the frame in which the average velocity of the source charge vanishes, into a
frame with βu ≃
1. The energy ﬂow predicted by the Poynting vector of the transformed
radiation ﬁelds does then not agree with that obtained by direct Lorentz transformation
of the energy-momentum 4-vectors of the radiated photons.

Einstein closes

§

In addition I may briefly remark that the following important law may be

If an electrically charged body
easily deduced from the developed equations:
is in motion anywhere in space without altering its charge when regarded from
a system of co-ordinates moving with the body, its charge also remains --when
regarded from the ‘‘stationary’’ system S-- constant.

This statement is true insofar as the value of the charge Q in the 4-vector electro-
magnetic current (12.6) is a Lorentz-invariant quantity. However the ‘eﬀective charge’,
proportional to the force on a test charge at a ﬁxed relative position, does vary with the

reduced by the fraction β2
u/2 at lowest order in βu, while the transverse ﬁeld is increased
by the same fraction. On averaging over an isotropic distribution of directions for a source
of ﬁxed velocity the radial electric ﬁeld is increased, at leading order in βu, by the fraction
β2
u/6.

A consequence of this is that a test charge close to a magnetostatic system experiences
I 2 where I is the magnet current. This is because the eﬀective charge of
an electric ﬁeld
moving conduction electrons is diﬀerent to that of the static positive ions of the conductor
I 2 of a superconducting magnet was observed and
material. The static transverse ﬁeld
published [49] in 1976, in agreement with the prediction of the RCED formula (9.21). The
same transverse electric ﬁeld is predicted by the CEM formula (9.19) when ψ = π/2.

It is important to notice that this ‘electrostatic ﬁeld in magnetostatics’ has no eﬀect
on the experiments which have tested, to very high precision, the neutrality of matter
by subjecting it to strong external electric ﬁelds and searching for the eﬀect of electric
forces [50, 51]. This is because, unlike the dependence of electric ﬁeld produced by a
charge on the motion of the charge, the force on a test charge due to an external electric
ﬁeld does not depend on the motion of the charge. See the Lorentz force equation (9.1).

the inﬂuence of electric and magnetic ﬁelds is considered. The particle is assumed to
be instantaeously at rest at the origin of S’ at the instant at which the origins of S and

satisﬁed by (13.2) but not by (E10.13A), is of general validity, following from the invari-

Since the methods used to derive, on the one hand (E10.12A) and(E10.13A), and on
the other (13.1) and (13.2), are diﬀerent it is perhaps not surprising that diﬀerent results
are obtained. Einstein introduces as a hypothesis the equality of the electromagnetic forces
in the frames S’ and S, and simply rewrites the S’ frame ﬁelds in terms of the S frame ones
according to the transformation equations (E10.8). In the case of the RCED equations
(13.1) and (13.2), the ﬁelds are directly calculated from the source currents using (9.21)
and (9.22) for the frame S and (9.28) and (9.29) for the frame S’ and substituted into
the Lorentz force equation (9.1). The left-hand sides of (13.1) and (13.2) are just an
expression of the relativistic version of Newton’s Second Law. The forces calculated in
this way are found not to be equal in the frames S’ and S, in contradiction to Einstein’s
assumption in Eqns(E10.12A) and (E10.13A).

In order to derive the left sides of (E10.12A) and (E10.13A ,the coordinates x′, y′ and t′
of (E10.4A) and (E10.5A) are transformed using the LT of (E10.7) with the replacements
t′. No details were provided of the calculation, so it must
ξ
be conjectured how it was performed. A calculation based on a certain assumption will
now be shown to yield the left sides of (E10.12A) and (E10.13A) from those of (E10.4A)
and (E10.5A). The assumption is that v and γ in the LT in (E10.7) may be considered
constant under the conditions of the problem. This is clearly in the spirit of the title of
10: ‘Dynamics of the Slowly Acclerated Electron’ and the supposed ‘slow’ motion of the
§
dx/dt (and hence v and γ)
electron, the latter meaning, presumably, v
≪
cannot be constant, as assumed, as this implies that d2x/dt2 = 0. Making, in any case,
this assumption, and considering inﬁnitesimal space and time intervals, the ratio of the
ﬁrst to the fourth equation in (E10.7) gives:

The ratio of the second to the fourth equations of (E7.10) gives

Two comments are in order:

(i) The velocity v is not constant under the conditions of the problem.

(ii) Eqn(13.6) does not correctly describe the relation between the t and t′ derivatives.

To demonstrate (ii) consider the diﬀerential form of the LT in (E10.7):

Where the time dependence (non-constant values) of v and γ is explicitly indicated.
Since, by hypothesis, the test charge is at rest at the origin of S’: x′ = 0, dx′/dt = 0 and
dx/dt = v(t), so that (13.11) may be written as:

describing an instantaneous time dilatation eﬀect. The correct relation between the time

These equations should be contrasted with Einstein’s results in (13.9). Correcting (E10.12A)
by replacing the factor γ3 on the left by γ4 it can be seen that this equation is no longer
in agreement with Eqn(13.1). Also the factor γ2 on the left side of (E10.13A) should be
replaced by γ4. This equation of transverse motion will be discussed further below.

The evident diﬀerence between the corrected equations (E10.12A) and (E10.13A) and
the RCED equations of motion (13.1) and (13.2) should come as no surprise. The physical
assumptions underlying these equations are quite diﬀerent. In (E10.12A) and (E10.13A)
the forces in S and S’ are, by hypothesis, equal. Simply, the electric ﬁelds in S’ have been
transformed into the ﬁelds in S according to the transformation laws in (E10.8). Similarly
the derivatives on the left sides are transformed (actually incorrectly), according to the

47

space-time transformations of (E10.7). But there is no physics in such a purely mathe-
matical transformation. In the case of (13.1) and (13.2) the electromagentic forces are
calculated using the appropriate formula in each frame, and are found not be equal. The
left sides of the equations contain no transformations, but are expressions of the relativis-
tic generalisation of Newton’s Second Law –a ‘force’, in any frame, may be operationally
deﬁned as the time derivative of of the momentum in that frame. The agreement between
(E10.12A) and (13.1) as a consequence of the incorrect second derivative transformation
equation in (13.9) must then be regarded as purely fortuitous.

The general relation (13.3), not respected by (E10.13A), will now be proved. It follows

from the invariance of the transverse coordinate interval under the LT:

dy = dy′

and the time dilatation relation (13.12). Eqn(13.16) implies conservation of relativistic
transverse momentum:

p′
T = m

dy′
dt′ = m

dy
dt′ = γm

dy

= pT

Since the transverse force is deﬁned, in any frame, as dpT /dt and (13.17) states that
transverse momentum is conserved, dpT = dp′
T ,

dpT

It is important to remark that if Einstein had consistently applied the condition that

of the source charge u

So, at this order, Einstein has indeed derived the Lorentz force equation as a consequence
of the transformation of the electric ﬁeld in the rest frame of the test charge, as previously
described in
6, concerning
6. In this context it is interesting to recall Einstein’s remark in
§
§
the equality of the forces on a test charge in frames in which it is either in motion or at
rest. The important caveat there mentioned: ‘which, if we neglect the terms multiplied
by the second and higher powers of v/c’, is forgotten in the last members of (E10.12A)
and (E10.13A) where the forces in the frames S and S’ are instead assumed to be exactly
equal, in equations where some terms of ‘the second and higher powers of v/c’ have been
retained

The RCED equations (13.1) and (13.2) are valid for all velocities, not only in the
small β limit.
It is crucial for Einstein’s subsequent arguments that the ﬁrst member
of (E10.13A), although derived on the basis of the false assumptions pointed out in the
remarks (i) and (ii) above, is actually identical to the third member of (13.1) and so is
relativistically correct, that is, valid to all orders in β. This is essential for the derivation
of the seminal equation (E10.17) where Einstein ﬁrst introduces the ‘E = mc2’ concept.

Invoking the Newtonian deﬁnition: Force = mass

acceleration, the concepts of
‘longitudinal’ and ‘transverse’ masses are suggested by the left sides of Eqns(E10.12A)
and (E10.13A) respectively:

Although the deﬁnition of ‘longitudinal mass’ is the same as that given by Lorentz
γ2 to be compared with Lorentz’
in the previous year [25] the ‘transverse mass’ is
γ. Thus Lorentz’ deﬁnitions of both masses are consistent with
deﬁnition where it is
the RCED formulae (13.1) and (13.2). The diﬀerence between the Lorentz and Einstein
deﬁnitions of transverse mass has been described in the literature as a diﬀerent ‘choice of
convention in the expression for force and mass in the dynamics of charged particles.’ [52].
This is misleading. The ‘convention’ happens to be correct for the longitudinal mass but
not for the transverse one. Stated more bluntly. Eqns(10.13A) and (E10.16) are both
wrong since the mathematically illicit calculation by which they are derived does not,
unlike in the case of (10.12A) and (E10.15), give, fortuitously, the correct result.

∝

In the English translation of Ref. [2] a footnote mentioning the work of Planck [46]
states that the Newtonian deﬁnition of force as mass times acceleration is perhaps not the
one best adapted to special relativity, but rather one in which ‘the laws momentum and
energy assume the simplest form’. This prompts another ‘What if?’ speculation similar
to the one in Section 11 above, concerning the Planck-Einstein relation (11.2). What if
Einstein had adopted instead the deﬁnition of a force (suggested by Newton’s First Law),
as the time derivative of the momentum, as in Eqns(13.1) and (13.2)? Having obtained
the correct equation in the ﬁrst member of (E10.12A) this would suggest the following
deﬁnition for the momentum of the electron:

This is just the relativistic momentum, introduced later by Planck [46].

After obtaining the equations of motion in the frame S, (E10.12)-(E10.14), and intro-

ducing Longitudinal and Transverse masses, the following comment is made:

We remark that these results as to the mass are also valid for ponderable

material points, because a ponderable material point can be made into an

49

electron (in our sense of the word) by the addition of an electric charge no
matter how small.

(Italics in the original) This is interesting, because, from a modern viewpoint, it is
understood that the mass variation is a purely kinematical eﬀect, valid for both charged
and neutral particles independently of any dynamics. Einstein derived the formulae for
charged particles in the context of classical electrodynamics and it is not clear from this
statement that dynamical and purely kinematical consequences of special relativity were
clearly separated in his mind at this point.

The next paragraph concerns the most important result of Ref. [2], both as a revolu-
tionary physical concept and for its practical consequences. The kinetic energy, W , of the
electron is calculated by the space integral of the x-component of the force in the frame
S using the ﬁrst member of Eqn(E10.12) or (E10.12A):

There follows the statement:

Thus when v = c, W becomes infinite.

Velocities greater than that of

light have --as in our previous results-- no possiblity of existence.

This has become a paradigm of 20th Century physics, often termed ‘causality’. It is
true of all physical objects with a time-like or light-like energy-momentum 4-vector such
that

It is not, however, true for virtual photons that, according to QED, are responsible for

Einstein did not state in Ref. [2] the equivalence of mass and energy that is implicit
in (E10.17). Later in 1905 he published another paper with the title ‘Does the Inertia of
a Body Depend upon its Energy Content’ [45] in which an ingenious thought experiment
involving (in modern terms) the emission of a pair of photons, as viewed from two diﬀerent
inertial frames, was analysed, to draw the conclusion:

If a body gives off energy L in the form of radiation its mass

diminishes by L/c2.

The analysis of the thought experiment was based on the previously found and correct
(but incorrectly derived) formula (E10.4) for the transformation of the energy of a plane
electromagnetic wave. At this stage light quanta were still ‘heuristic’ and the equations
of relativistic particle kinematics, later to be written down by Planck, were not available.

However, it is already clear from (E10.17) that the term mc2 has the dimensions of
energy and is associated with the mass of the particle. This equation may be rewritten

would have been obtained. This equation, (13.26) and the identity γ2

Combining (13.27) and (13.28):

Thus the equations of relativistic kinematics (13.25)-(13.29) were already implicit in the
formulae given in Ref. [2], so that no further thought experiment was required to obtain
Eqn(13.29).

Finally, after noting that, by energy conservation, a change in potential energy equal
to the kinetic energy W in (E10.12) is obtained (Eqn(E10.19)), the motion of an electron
in a constant magnetic ﬁeld was considered, making use of (E10.13). The magnetic ﬁeld
is parallel to the z-axis, but as throughout the paper, the source remains unspeciﬁed. The

It is informative to compare these results with the prediction of Eqn(13.2). Placing a

the value of the electric ﬁeld in (13.2) from Ey to (1

14 Summary: Einstein’s Mistakes

As stated in the Introduction, and implicit in the title of Ref. [2], the purpose of
Einstein’s formulation of Special Relativity Theory (SRT)14, on the basis of the Special
Relativity Principle and the constancy of the speed of light, was:

...the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the

electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell’s theory for stationary
bodies.

This reliance on the phenomena of Classical Electromagnetism (CEM) in construct-
ing the theory is manifest in the ‘Kinematical Part’ of Ref. [2], through the adoption of
the Light Signal Clock Synchronisation Procedure (LSCSP) to deﬁne simultaneous and
spatially separated events. Since SRT describes the physics of (ﬂat) space-time that un-
derlies all dynamical physical phenomena (with possible exception of gravity), Einstein’s
approach is, a priori, a perfectly valid one. However, applying Ockham’s razor, it is not
the simplest and most economical one (i.e. that with the smallest number of, and the
simplest, necessary initial postulates) to obtain SRT. This was aleady realised as early
as 1910 by Ignatowsky [30]. The space-time Lorentz Transformation (LT), from which
all purely kinematical consequences of SRT may be obtained, does not require, for its
derivation, the consideration of SRT or of any other dynamical theory [53, 1, 32, 33].
The derivations, of the latter type, of the LT, in Refs. [32, 33], shown in Fig.4, may be
compared with Einstein’s (putative) derivation shown in Fig.3.

After establising the LSCSP in

1, Einstein discusses in
§

2 a thought experiment
§
which purports to demonstrate, without invoking the LT, ‘relativity if simultaneity’ (RS)
by applying the LSCSP of
2 to two moving clocks at diﬀerent positions in the same
§
inertial frame. The analysis presented of this thought experiment is Einstein’s ﬁrst major
mistake. The LSCSP is deﬁned for clocks at rest in some inertial frame; it makes no sense
to apply the same equations to moving clocks, the velocities of which, relative to light
signals, in the frame under consideration, are not equal to c. The LSCSP is clearly based
on the assumption of a constant velocity of light signals relative to the to-be-synchronised
clocks, which are at rest in the frame in which the procedure is applied. As shown in
Fig.5 and Table 1 , the events considered by Einstein in the ‘stationary’ frame S are not
the Lorentz-transformed LSCSP events in the ‘moving’ frame S’. The explicit calculation
presented in Section 5 shows that the clocks introduced by Einstein at A and B, which
have an apparent (time dilated) rate equal to that of clocks at rest in S, are judged to be
synchronous by observers in both S and S’, in contradiction to Einstein’s conclusion.

In the derivation of the LT in

3, the false correspondence of the events in S in Fig.5c
§
and 5e with those in S’ in Fig.5b and 5d respectively, assumed in
2, is maintained. As
§
described in detail in Section 6 above, that the correct LT for a synchronisaed clock at
the origin of S’ (E3.27)-(E3.30) is obtained from the incorrect assignment of events in S
and S’ just mentioned, is due to other, compensating, errors in the derivation. The ﬁrst is
the neglect of the x-dependence of the LT in the initial ansatz for the time transformation

14For the reader’s convenience, some acronyms introduced earlier in the paper are redeﬁned in the

present section

52

equation: τ = τ (x′, y, z, t) instead of τ = τ (x′, x, y, z, t) where x′ = L = x(t = 0) is a
clock synchronisation constant. The second is the neglect of this constant in the LT ﬁnally
obtained. In the derivation, the space time coordinates in the ﬁnal equations obtained
are actually those of events at the point B, whereas the LT derived is appropriate only
to a clock at A (the origin in S’). Einstein’s ‘derivation’ of the LT is therefore fallacious,
both with respect to the initial assumptions concerning the transformed events, and with
respect to the correct physical interpretation of the space-time coordinates appearing in
the ﬁnal result; τ is not the proper time in S’, as assumed, for example, in Eqn(E3.8) and
Eqn(E3.10), but the apparent time of a clock at the origin of S’ as viewed from S (see the
discussion of the operational meaning of the symbols in the LT in Section 2 above).

The second major mistake in Ref. [2] is the ‘length contraction’ (LC) eﬀect of Eqn(E4.2)
resulting from the failure to take into account the appropriate value of x′ (or L) for the
clocks concerned. The LT for a synchronised clock at the center of the considered sphere,
at rest in S’, is applied also to points on the surface of the sphere, where in does not
correctly describe synchronised clocks. Use of the correct LT for a point on the surface
of the sphere shows (Eqn(7.8)) that there is no apparent distortion of the sphere due to
the LT when it is viewed from S. Interestingly enough, the standard RS eﬀect (7.9) asso-
ciated with the spurious LC eﬀect of (E4.2), as described in all text books on SRT, is not
mentioned in Ref. [2]. The RS eﬀect of
2, obtained without invoking the LT, although
§
equally spurious, is related to diﬀerent events in S and S’, than those giving (7.9).

Einstein’s discussion of asymmetric aging, by considering observations of a stationary
clock and a moving one, after the correct derivation of the Time Dilatation (TD) formula
(E4.4), is misleading, since only an observer in the ‘stationary’ frame S is considered.
Similar asymmetric aging (but in the opposite sense) will be seen by an observer at rest
in the ‘moving’ frame S’ when clocks at rest in S are compared with those at rest in S’.
In order to investigate the true ‘Twin Paradox’ clocks at rest in the same inertial frame
before and after a round trip must be compared. For this the acceleration and deceleration
of one (or both) of the Twins must be taken into account. Einstein does not do this in
Ref. [2].

Consideration in Section 7 of clocks at diﬀerent positions on the surface of the Earth,
as viewed by observers at diﬀerent positions, shows clearly that both TD and and gravi-
tational frequency shifts are apparent (i.e. observer dependent) not ‘real’ eﬀects. Similar
clocks, in diﬀerent frames, run, unless directly perturbed by gravitational or other envi-
ronmental eﬀects, at the same rate when viewed by an observer in the proper frame of
each clock.

Turning now to the ‘Electrodynamic Part’ of Ref. [2], it should be pointed out that the
transformation laws of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, (E9.13)-(E6.15), obtained by imposing
the covariance of Maxwell’s equations in ‘free space’ under the LT, are based on the tacit
assumption that electric and magnetic ﬁelds are local ‘classical’ ones for which the space
and time coordinates may be taken as independent variables in the diﬀerential calculus.
Recalling the operational meaning of electromagnetic ﬁelds as proportional to the force on
a test charge at the corresponding space-time position, it is clear that such ﬁelds cannot
exist in ‘free space’ –there must be at least one source charge in the proximity of the
ﬁeld point to produce the ﬁelds. Taking this fact into account, the simplest non-trivial

53

electrodynamical system, where mechanical forces act, must consist of a least two charges,
one the ‘test charge’ and the other the ‘source charge’. When such a system is considered
it is clear from the formulae giving the ﬁelds of a uniformly moving charge, in either CEM
or the recently developed relativistic theory (RCED) [11], that, in the case that the source
charge moves along the x-axis, the derivatives with respect to time and the x-coordinate
are not independent, as required for a local classical ﬁeld, but are related by Eqn(9.24).
This formula has been previously given in text books on CEM [54, 55] but its implication
for the transformation laws of electric and magnetic ﬁelds has only recently been worked
out [14]. Because time and the x-coordinate are not independent variables for the force
ﬁelds of both CEM and RCED, these ﬁelds do not necessarily transform as a second-rank
tensor according to the equations (9.7) and (9.15)-(9.18) or Eqns(E6.13)-(E6.15). Explicit
calculation of the transformation laws of the RCED ﬁelds between the frames S and S’
using Eqns(9.21)-(9.22) and (9.28)-(9.29) shows agreement with the tensor transformation
law for the transverse electric and magnetic ﬁelds given by Eqns(E6.14) and (E6.15), but
not for the longitudinal component of the electric ﬁeld. The ﬁrst equation in (E6.13):

is replaced by the ﬁrst formula in (9.30):

E

′
x′ = Ex

E′

x′ =

γu
γw

Ex

(14.1)

(14.2)

where the source charge moves with velocities u,w along the x-axis in the frames S and
S’ respectively. Thus the longitudinal electric ﬁeld, unlike the transverse electric and
magnetic ﬁelds, does not transform in a covariant manner –its value depends on the
source charge velocities in both S and S’. In fact there is, in the problem, a ‘preferred
frame’ that breaks special relativistic covariance –it is the frame, S∗, where the source
charge is at rest.

It is also shown by direct calculation of spatial and temporal derivatives using the
RCED ﬁelds (9.21) and (9.22), and the relation (9.24), that Amp`ere’s Law is a neces-
sary consequence of the electric ﬁeld Gauss Law, thus deriving Maxwell’s ‘Displacement
Current’ term in the former, and that both the x-component of Amp`ere’s Law and the
electric ﬁeld Gauss Law are modiﬁed by covariance-breaking terms that depend on the
velocity of the source charge. Einstein’s initial hypotheis for the derivation of Eqs(E6.13)-
(E6.15) –the covariance of Maxwell’s Equations– is thererefore invalid for the RCED force
ﬁelds. However, the y- and z-components of Amp`ere’s Law, the Faraday-Lenz Law and
the magnetic Gauss Law remain covariant for the RCED force ﬁelds.

At the end of

6, Einstein re-discusses the problem, introduced in the Introduction,
§
of electromagnetic induction in diﬀerent reference frames, in the light of the ﬁeld trans-
formation laws (E6.13)-(E6.15). Already in the Introduction, Einstein indicates that the
‘luminiferous aether’ of the 19th Century will become superﬂuous; here it is further sug-
gested that the ‘electromotive force’ (the magnetic Lorentz force) and, by implication,
the magnetic ﬁeld itself, is only an ‘auxiliary concept’. By the same token it could be
argued that the electric ﬁeld, also deﬁned by the force on a test charge, is a similar ‘aux-
iliary concept’, but Einstein does not take this further step. Somewhat inconsistently,
Einstein is prepared to throw away the aether, but not the ‘electromagnetic waves’ sup-
posed throughout the 19th Century and beyond, to propagate in it. It is tantamount to

throwing away the ocean but not the waves on the shore. What was needed to complete
Einstein’s revolution was the concept of light as a particle, that replaces, in an ontological
sense, the ‘electromagnetic waves’. In spite, however, of having won the Nobel Prize for
the discovery of the photon it is not clear that Einstein, even to the end of his life15, ever
embraced the concept, trivially accepted by all practitioners of experimental High Energy
Physics, that the photon is a elementary particle like any other such. From a modern
viewpoint (see Ref. [11]) both electric and magnetic ﬁelds are second level mathematical
abstractions. The true seat of the fundamental underlying physics is to be found in QED
processes. For the mechanical eﬀects described, classically, by electric and magnetic force
ﬁelds, it is the exchange, in a symmetric manner, of space-like virtual photons between
the source and test charges.

Einstein’s failure to obtain the noncovariant transformation law (14.2) of the longi-
tudinal electric ﬁeld results from the introduction of such ﬁelds as the a priori physical
concepts in terms of which the theory is framed, without properly taking into account
the physical phenomenon (inter-charge forces) that is to be described with the aid of the
ﬁelds. When this is done it is quite clear that the ﬁelds are not classical and local but
have an essential functional dependence on the physical parameters of the source charge
(or charges). Einstein, also, in common with the authors of many text books on CEM
makes no distinction (using identical mathematical symbols) between the ‘force ﬁelds’
considered in
8, although
10 and the ‘radiation ﬁelds’ considered in
§
§
the operational meaning of the ﬁelds is quite diﬀerent in each case.

In

7, devoted to the Doppler eﬀect for electromagnetic waves and the aberration of
§
light, Einstein presumably derives the associated formulae by assuming equality of the
phases deﬁned by Eqns(E7.4) and (E7.8), Lorentz transforming the space-time coordinates
in (E7.8) into the S frame using the LT (E3.27)-(E3.30) and equatiing the coeﬃcients
of the S frame coordinates to obtain the correct relations (E7.9)-(E7.15). However, as
explained in Section 10, such a procedure is of somewhat dubious mathematical validity.
Both phases actually vanish, due to the vanishing of the factor in curly brackets, in each
case. The phases are therefore equal (and zero) for arbitary ﬁnite values of ω and ω′
as well as those satisfying Eqn(E7.9). As shown in Section 10, a less dubious derivation
of (E7.9)-(E7.15) is provided by exploiting the manifestly Lorentz-scalar property of the
phase.

At the end of

7, the formulae (E7.17) and (E7.18) for the transformation law of the
§
square of the amplitude of what Einstein calls ‘the amplitude of the electric of magnetic
force’ are written down, without any derivation. In view of the similarity between the nu-
merators and denominators of the right sides of (E7.13) and (E7.17) it may be conjectured
that Einstein is confusing the concepts of frequency and ﬁeld amplitude (or incorrectly
assuming that they are proportional) at this point. At the beginning of the following
8
§
it is stated that:

Since A2/8π equals the energy of light per unit volume we have to regard
(A′)2/8π, by the principle of relativity, as the energy of light (presumably
also per unit volume) in the moving system.

15In a letter to Besso in 1951, Einstein made the comment on the subject of the light quantum ‘Heute

glaubt zwar jeder Lump, er wisse es, aber er tr¨aucht sich’[56].

55

This statement correctly identiﬁes A and A′ as the ﬁeld amplitudes of a plane elec-
tromagnetic wave in the frames S and S’ respectively. They are not ‘the amplitude of the
electric of magnetic force’ as stated in the previous section. Indeed this last deﬁnition
is physically meaningless, since A and A′ correspond to radiation ﬁelds that describe,
classically, a parallel beam of monochromatic photons [17], not intercharge forces. This
demonstrates Einstein’s confusion concerning the diﬀerent physical interpretations that
must be assigned to force ﬁelds and radiation ﬁelds. Since A2/8π = ρE where ρE is the
energy density of the plane electromagnetic wave, Eqns(E7.17) and (E7.18) give, accord-
ing to Einstein, the transformation law of this energy density. They are incorrect. This is
the third major error in Ref. [2]. The correct transformation law for ρE, Eqn(10.11), is ac-
ρ′
tually given by the later equation (E8.4), on making the replacements E
E.
The quantities E and E′ in Eqn(E8.4) are the total energies of what Einstein calls a
‘light complex’. In order to derive the correct transformation for ρE from the incorrect
transformation law for A2, (E7.17), the ‘light complex’ is deﬁned as an arbitary spherical
region, in the frame S, of an (inﬁnite) plane electromagetic wave, and the spurious LC
4 is applied. The volume of the resulting ellipsoid of revolution, suppos-
eﬀect derived in
§
edly observed in the frame S’, to that of the sphere in S is the reciprocal of the ratio of
A′ to A given by Eqn(E7.17). Consideration of the total energy of the contracted ‘light
complex’ in S’ then leads to the formula (E8.4), which must actually replace the incorrect
formula (E7.17) as the transformation law for ρE or A2. As previously, in the derivation
of the LT, incorrect formulae, (E7.17) and (E8.2) are combined in such a way as to give a
correct result, here the transformation law (E8.4), on replacing the spurious quantity, E:
‘energy of the light complex’, by A2/8π or ρE. Indeed, in view of the frequency transfor-
mation formula (E7.13), the Planck-Einstein relation and the Lorentz invariance of the
photon number density, the correct transformation law of ρE, Eqn(10.11), is an immediate
consequence of (E7.13).

In the discussion of the radiation pressure due to reﬂection of a plane electromagnetic
wave at oblique incidence on a uniformly moving plane mirror in the second part of
8, the
§
incorrect formula (E7.17) for the transformation of the amplitude of an electomagnetic
wave is used, yielding the incorrect formulae (E8.6) and (E8.12) used in the analysis of the
reﬂection problem. The formula ﬁnally obtained for the light pressure (E8.17) is correct,
but in order to derive it using the wrong amplitude transformation equations (E8.6) and
(E8.12) Einstein commits the fourth (and most ﬂagrant) major mistake in Ref. [2]. The
formula (E8.16), that is purported to be the energy ﬂux of the reﬂected wave is actually
the energy ﬂux of a wave of the same dimensions and direction as the reﬂected wave but
incident on the back surface of the mirror! (see Fig.7b). The writer of the present paper
ﬁnds in very diﬃcult to understand why, to his best knowledge, this obvious blunder has
not been pointed out in the century since Ref. [2] was written. Combining this absurd
ﬂux calculation with the incorrect formula (E8.12) for A′′′ , gives, fortuitously, the correct
result (E8.17) for the radiation pressure.
In fact the ﬂux of reﬂected photons is equal
to the ﬂux of incident photons (in the reﬂection process exactly one photon is created
for each photon that is destroyed). The diﬀerent energy ﬂux then results solely from the
transformation of photon energy by reﬂection. The correct result for the radiation pressure
is then obtained by using (E8.4) or (10.11) to transform ρE and assuming equal ﬂuxes
of incident and reﬂected photons. This calculation is in Eqns(11.3)-(11.6). Alternatively
an ‘energy ﬂow’ analysis, as done by Einstein can be performed, usng the correct photon
ﬂuxes and energy densities to obtain the same result. This calculation yields Eqns(11.13)-

56

(11.15).

The ﬁfth and sixth major mistakes in Ref [2] occur in the concluding section
10,
§
‘Dynamics of the Slowly Accelerated Electron’, but as in previous cases discussed above,
the eﬀects of the errors cancel in the ﬁnal, and in this case crucial, result. Thus the
formula (E10.12), that is integrated to obtain the seminal relation (E10.7) demonstrating
the equivalence of mass and energy, is correct.

The ﬁfth error is a conceptual one.

In order to derive the diﬀerential equation of
motion of the ‘Slowly Accelertated Electron’ in the frame S from that in the frame S’
(where it is instantaneously at rest), the coordinates and ﬁelds in the former equation
are simply transformed into those of the frame S’ using the equations (E10.7)-(E10.8).
Such a procedure correctly predicts the Lorentz Force Equation in the frame S to the
lowest order in β (i.e. neglecting corrections of O(β2)). However, since only a change of
variables is performed it is assumed that the force components are equal in the frames S
and S’. Explicit caclulation of the forces for the case of a uniformly moving source charge
using the RCED equations (9.21) and (9.22) shows that the forces are not equal in the two
frames when O(β2) and higher order corrections are included. Einstein’s initial hypothesis
in deriving Eqns(E10.12)-(E10.14) is therefore not correct in the relativistic theory.

≡

The sixth error occurs in the calculation of the Jacobian relating d2ξ/dτ 2 in Eqn(10.4)
to d2x/dt2 in Eqn(10.12). This calculation assumes that v and γ are constant in Eqn(10.7),
dx/dt, this is impossible. Calculating correctly the Jaco-
but that dx/dt is not. Since v
bian, allowing for the time dependence of v and γ, and the Lorentz invariance of spatial in-
tervals dξ = dx, results in the replacement γ3
γ4
in the left sides of (E10.13) and (E10.14). The spatial integration of the so-modiﬁed
Eqn(E10.12) then no longer yields the mass-energy equivalence relation (E10.17). In fact
the γ3 factor on the left side of (E10.12) is correct, but it orginates not from the Jacobian
of a coordinate transformation but from the deﬁnition of force as the time derivative of
momentum and the deﬁnition, (13.32), of relativistic momentum (see Eqn(13.1).

In judging the value of any scientiﬁc work which satisﬁes the necessary pre-requisites
of internal self-consistency and formal correctness, two questions are paramount: ﬁrstly,
is it original? and secondly, is it important? These criteria will ﬁrst be applied, point-
by-point, to the list, (a)-(k), of correct results from Ref. [2] just given, before, ﬁnally,

62

discussing Einstein’s methodology in more general terms, and giving a personal opinion
about the merit of the work presented in Ref. [2] from the perspective of the 21st Century.

Concerning (a), the LT in the form (15.1)-(15.4) was ﬁrst given by Larmor in 1900
[24, 27]. The transformation given by Lorentz in 1904 in his last pre-relativity paper
[25] was identical to that of Larmor [24, 27]. The transformation was given the name
‘Lorentz Transformation’ by Poincar´e in 1905 [26] The essential diﬀerence from earlier,
or contemporary but independent, authors was that Einstein claimed for the ﬁrst time
to derive the LT from some simple axioms. Although, as shown in Section 6 above, the
‘derivation’ of Ref. [2] was actually fallacious, the essential idea was taken up by many
later authors, so that, at the present time, the literature devoted to the derivation of the
LT on the basis of various initial postulates is vast. See Refs. [31, 32] for citations of only
the derivations that do not employ Einstein’s second postulate.

The time dilatation prediction (15.5) in (a) is one of the two key predictions of Ref. [2]
that changed, for ever, a fundamental conception of physics. As a physical consequence of
the relativistic transformation of time it was ﬁrst pointed out by Larmor in 1897 [59, 27]
who noted that orbiting electrons in a uniformly moving inertial frame will appear, to
β2/2 at O(β2). In
a stationary observer, to be moving slow by the factor 1/γ, or 1
diﬀerential form, (15.5) is the basis for relativistic kinematics. The energy-momentum
4-vector, P, in the frame S, of a physical object of mass m, that is at rest in the frame S’,
is derived from the space-time 4-vector X

(cτ ; ~x) in S according to the relation:

−

m

dX
dt′ = mγ

P

≡

= m(γc; γ~v)

mV

≡

≡
dX
dτ

(15.38)

where V is the 4-vector velocity in the frame S.

Although Lorentz had previously introduced the concept of ‘local time’ as early as
1895 [60], and the diﬀerential form of (11.15) appears as an intermediate step (among
many others) in the section of Poincar´e’s 1906 relativity paper [61] entitled ‘Contraction
of Electrons’, it seems reasonable to claim that Einstein was the ﬁrst to publish the
interpretation of the TD relation (15.5) as a universal property of the observed time of
any uniformly moving clock.

The velocity addition formulae of (b) and (h) above were ﬁrst given, independently,

by Einstein in Ref. [2] and Poincar´e [61].

The transformation laws (15.9)-(15.12) of transverse electric ﬁelds and magnetic ﬁelds
in (c) were ﬁrst published by Larmor in 1900 [24, 27]. They were also given, independently
of Einstein’s work, by Lorentz in 1904 [25], and Poincar´e in 1906 [61].

To the present writer’s best knowledge, the formulae in (d) for the relativistic Doppler
shift and aberration of light were given for the ﬁrst time by Einstein in Ref. [2]. They
contain implicitly, in view of the Planck-Einstein relation Eγ = hν, the relativistic kine-
matics of photons. Similarly, given the photon concept, the transformation formulae for
the energy density of a plane electromagnetic wave, (15-16) and (15.17) in (e) also follow
directly from (15.13) and the Planck-Einstein relation.

The correct relativistic light pressure formula, (15.8), in (f) was obtained for the ﬁrst

63

time by Einstein in Ref. [2], albeit as the result of an absurdly incorrect derivation (see
Section 11 above).

The covariance of the transverse components of Amp`ere’s Law and of the Faraday-
Lenz Law in (g) were independently demonstrated by Larmor in 1900 [24, 27], Lorentz in
1904 [25], and by Poincar´e in 1906 [61].

The transformation of the charge and current densities in (15.23)-(15.28) of (h) were
also independently obtained by Poincar´e [61]. It is interesting to note that the 4-vector
character of the charge and current densities in (15.23) and (15.24), also pointed out
by Poincar´e [61], as well the 4-vector character of U

Einstein’s formulae (15.23)-(15.28). Choosing ~u parallel to the x-axis, (15.24), (15.25)

Comparing (15.39) and (15.40) with (15.1) and (15.2), it can be seen that ρQ and ρQu
transform in the same manner as τ and x respectively under the LT, and so constitute a
4-vector. Using the relation (15.28) to transform the charge density in the rest frame of

In (i) the right side of (15.32) gives the Lorentz force, the magnetic part of which also,
as explained in
6: ‘...which if we neglect the terms multiplied by second and higher powers
§
of v/c (my italics) is equal to the vector product of the velocity of the charge and the
magnetic force’ (should be ‘magnetic ﬁeld’)‘multiplied by the velocity of light’. In fact,
the right side of (15.32) gives the Lorentz force correctly to all orders in v/c; the left side,
however, is the Newtonian expression for the time derivative of the momentum. This
elegant derivation of the Lorentz force equation, directly from the transformation laws of
electric and magnetic ﬁelds, although only valid to ﬁrst order in β, gives a deep insight
into what Einstein calls the ‘auxiliary’ nature of the ‘magnetic ﬁeld’ concept relative to the
physical eﬀect –the force on a test charge– considered. It may be contrasted with Lorentz’
derivation of his force formula based on a Lagrangian containing the electromagnetic
potential and the Principle of Least Action. This, also discusssed in detail by Poincar´e [61],
is by comparison, lengthy and rich in mathematical detail, but weak in physical insight. A
similar derivation may be found in the well-known text-book of Landau and Lifschitz [62]
as well as in Ref.[11] by the present author.

Eqn(15.33) gives the correct relativistic generalisation of Newton’s Second Law, for
the problem considered. The last member of this equation was independently given by
Poincar´e in Section 7 of Ref. [61]. However neither Einstein nor Poincar´e introduced
the concept of relativistic momentum implicit in the ﬁrst member of (15.33). The sec-
ond member of the equation is crucial for the derivation of the mass-energy equivalence
relation (15.34) of (j). The most original and, in view of practical applications, most
important, prediction of Ref. [2] is that of (j) –the equivalence of mass and energy. For
this it is necessary to introduce the deﬁnition of relativistic energy of (15.35) by mathe-
matical substitution in (15.34). The resulting formula, as well as the ‘E = mc2’ relation
(15.36) are both of completely general validity. The paper, published by Einstein later
in 1905 [16], containing the (controversial16) thought experiment relating (to the lowest
order in β2 only) the change of mass of an object with radiated eletromagnetic energy is
then unecessary to establish the mass-energy equivalence. Although Poincar´e had noted
as early as 1900 that the momentum of an electromagnetic wave is is 1/c2 times the en-
ergy ﬂux given by the Poynting vector [66], suggesting, in view of the classical deﬁnition
of momentum a mass density 1/c2 times the energy density, Einstein’s equation (15.34)
shows clearly the general equivalence of mass and energy as well as showing that c is the
limiting speed of any object that has a time-like energy momentum 4-vector.

Einstein’s relation for the radius of curvature of the orbit of an electron in a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld was was obtained previously by Lorentz [25] and even demonstrated by
him in the same paper to to be in reasonable agreement with measurements of Kaufmann
dating from 1902 [63]. This means that some experimental evidence for the non-Newtonian
mechanics of SRT existed even before SRT was invented! However other predictions based,
like that of Lorentz, on specﬁc electrodynamical models of the electron due to Abraham
and Bucherer could not be excluded in 1904. It was not until 1908 that the SRT prediction
of (15.36) was experimentally veriﬁed by Bucherer [64].

Einstein is now universally considered to be the founding father of SRT. Is this a
fair assesment in view of the previously published work of Larmor and Lorentz, and
the contemporary, but independent, work of Poincar´e? It is sometimes claimed that it
was Einstein who introduced the Special Relativity Principle into physics and that this
principle was not (or only partially) understood by the other authors just cited. The
present writer ﬁnds it very diﬃucult to understand this ,since this Principle was clearly
stated by Galileo in a graphic manner [65] and was also well known to Newton. Two lines of
algebra suﬃce to to demonstrate the invariance of Newton’s Second Law under Galilean
transformations. This Principle –that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial
frames– is true in both classical Newtonian mechanics and in relativistic mechanics.

One important diﬀerence between Einstein, on the one hand, and Larmor, Lorentz
and Poincar´e on the other, was that the latter authors were all working on aether theories
or electrodynamic models of electron structure whereas Einstein clearly stated that the
aether was ‘superﬂous’ in his approach. However Einstein still clung to the concept of
classical ﬁelds, and of wave motion in such ﬁelds, whereas in all other domains of physics
such ﬁelds require some material support for their existence. The modern solution, after
rejecting the aether, is to embrace the photon concept that renders also ‘superﬂuous’

16In 1952 Ives claimed that the argument in Ref. [16] was circular [57]. Ives’ arguments were contested

by later authors. See Ref. [58] and references therein.

electric and magnetic force ﬁelds [11] and identiﬁes radiation ﬁelds as the classical limit
of quantum mechanical probability amplitudes [17, 14]. Einstein never did this, either in
Ref. [2] or in any later work.

Pro-Einstein advocates often state, with some justiﬁcation, that he was the ﬁrst to
understand that SRT deals with space-time geometry and kinematics, not with dynamics.
This seems not to be borne out by titles of the papers in which the related work was
published: Larmor ,‘On a dynamical theory of the electric and luminiferous medium’ [59]
and ‘Aether and Matter’ [24]; Lorentz, [25] ‘Electromagnetic phenomena in a system
moving with any velocity less than that of light’, Einstein, [2] ‘On the electrodynamics
of moving bodies’; Poincar´e [61] ‘On the dynamics of the electron’. The only paper that
does not speciﬁcally mention dynamics is that of Lorentz. Given that the ‘moving body’
introduced in the mechanical section
10 of Ref. [2] is an ‘electron’ the titles of the Einstein
§
and Poincar´e papers are very similar. However large parts of the latter are an attempt
to describe electrons, considered from a modern viewpoint as just one type of elementary
partical among many others, as a structure generated by the electromagnetic ﬁeld and
other forces of unspeciﬁed origin. This subject was not considered by Einstein. However,
Einstein’s caveat concerning the physical meaning of the diﬀerential equations of motion
and the longitudinal and transverse masses of his ‘electron’ indicates that he did not fully
appreciate, at the time of writing Ref. [2], the purely kinematical nature of these formulae.

Looking at the list, (a)-(h), of formally correct predictions, only the formulae for
Doppler shift and aberration, the radiation pressure formula and the mass-energy euiv-
alence relation are to be found in Einstein’s work and not that of either Larmor and
Lorentz, and/or Poincar´e. In particular, the predictions in (a), (b), (c), (g), (h) and (j)
were also all given (at least as formulae) by Poincar´e in Ref.[61].

Some writers on the history of SRT have tended to be unfair to either Poincar´e [67]
or to Einstein [68, 69], while they, and many others, have largely ignored the work of
Larmor. A notable exception is to be found in Pauli’s monograph on SRT written in 1921
and re-issued in English translation in 1958 [53]. In particular, Larmor’s priority for the
LT is pointed out. Also the space-time geometric aspects of SRT, usually associated with
the work of Minkowski [70], as well as the Group Theory of the LT, both of which were
ﬁrst developed by Poincar´e in Ref. [61], are cited by Pauli.

The major diﬀerence between the work of Einstein and that of his contemporaries lies,
however, not in the mathematical results obtained but rather in style and methodology
– the introduction of thought experiments, not only, as previously in popular scientiﬁc,
but also in research, literature, and concentration on essential points using the minimal
amount of mathematics to resolve the physical problems addressed.
In common with
Newton is the use of the minimum number of, and simplest possible, initial postulates,
from which the conclusions are deduced by mathematical logic17. Einstein saw very clearly
that the space-time LT, if it was not to remain a mathematical abstraction, had to describe
real, physical, clocks. This important concept is to be found nowhere in work of Larmor
and Lorentz, or (in contrast to his popular essays) in the research papers of Poincar´e.
Such clocks were an essential part of the thought experiments discussed in
3
§
4 of Ref. [2]. Unfortunately, as pointed out in Sections 5, 6 and 7 above, both the
and

§

17This point was particularly stressed by Holton [52]

66

light signal clock synchronisation procedure of
2 and the physical meaning of the second
§
postulate deﬁned in this section are misinterpreted. Crucially, the additive constants ‘to
be placed on the right side of each of these (LT) equations’ were also neglected, leading
to a fallacious ‘derivation’ of the LT and spurious LC and RS eﬀects, although only the
LC eﬀect was discussed in Ref. [2].

In fact, the work of the present author, pointing out the spurious nature of the LC
and RS eﬀects, is doing nothing more than interpreting the space-time LT in the way that
it is said in Ref. [2] that it must be –introducing additive constants to correctly describe
synchronised clocks at diﬀerent spatial locations. It is perhaps surprising that Einstein
did not do himself what is clearly stated must be done, if clocks at diﬀerent positions are
considered, in the passage quoted in Section 2 above. Even more surprising is that it has
also been overlooked, for more than a century, by historians of science and practitioners
of SRT

Just as Einstein gave several fallacious proofs of correct formulae in Ref. [2] so a
genuine RS eﬀect does indeed exist in SRT in the case that synchronised clocks in two
diﬀerent inertial frames are viewed from a third one [7, 6]. Also the distance between two
events (although not the dimensions of a physical object) may be diﬀerent as measured
in diﬀerent inertial frames [71], albeit not in the way described by Einstein’s LC eﬀect.

In conclusion, in the present writer’s opinion, the most important message contained
in Ref. [2] is the necessity to modify the mechanical theory established by Newton by
redeﬁning the Newtonian momentum and energy of any physical object according to
Eqns(13.22) and (13.26) above. These formulae were not given explicitly in Ref. [2], but,
as shown above, were implicit, in many places, in the results presented in the paper,
such as in the TD relation (15.5) leading to the velocity 4-vector of Eqn(15.37), in the
transformation laws of the frequency (15.13) and the energy density (15.16) of a plane
electromagnetic wave (a parallel beam of monochromatic photons), in the transformation
laws of charge densities and currents (15.23)-(15.28) and the mass-energy equivalence
relation (15.34). For this alone, and in spite of its many ﬂaws, both of physical principles
and in the mathematical derivations presented, Ref. [2] still remains a serious candidate
to be considered the most important single physics paper to be published during the 20th
Century.

Figure 1: Concept ﬂow diagram of RCED. The steps in the derivation of the intercharge
force equation are inside the dot-dashed line. Downwards-directed lines indicate concept
transfer or derivation, e.g.
in the case of the 4-vector potential or electric or magnetic
ﬁelds, by mathematical substitution in a previously derived equation. The ‘Intercharge
Force’ is given by Eqn(3.4) below. Maxwell’s Equations, which are all derived, to lowest
order in β, in this approach are denoted by ME. The lower part of the ﬁgure, outside
the dot-dashed line, where the ‘Intercharge Force’ is obtained from Maxwell’s Equations
and/or the Biot-Savart and Lorentz Force Laws, corresponds closely with the concept ﬂow
of 19th Century CEM shown in Fig.2.

82

Figure 2: Concept ﬂow diagram of the 19th Century development of CEM. All ‘Empiri-
cal Laws’ and ‘Classical Theoretical Predictions’, with the exception of ‘EM waves’, are
included in the single box ‘Intercharge Force’ of Fig.1.

83

Figure 3: Concept ﬂow diagram of the derivation of the Voigt Transformation, and of the
Larmor-Lorentz and Einstein derivations of the Lorentz Transformation (LT). Einstein’s
second postulate stated only the source velocity independence of the speed of light. The
constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames was considered by Einstein to be a
‘Law of Nature’ and to therefore be a direct consequence of the Special Relativity Principle.
Additional necessary assumptions for Einstein’s derivation are linearity of the equations,
the Reciprocity Principle (if the velocity of the inertial frame S’ relative to S is ~v, then
the velocity of S relative to S’ is -~v) and spatial isotropy.

84

Figure 4: Concept ﬂow diagram of the derivations of the LT in Refs. [32, 33]. No electro-
dynamical concepts or other dynamical laws are invoked. Einstein’s second postulate, as
well as the constancy of the speed of light, are consequences of relativistic kinematics and
the masslessness of the photon. The crucial derivation of the limiting velocity, V , was
already done by Ignatowsky [30] in 1910.

Figure 5: Electromagnetic induction due to a simple two charge ‘magnet’ in: a) the frame
in which the magnet is at rest and the test charge q is in motion and: b) the frame in
which the magnet is in motion and the test charge is at rest. In b) the Heaviside formula
(3.1) predicts that the electric ﬁeld of each source charge is radial and so conﬁned to the
x′y′ plane at the position of the test charge. Since there is then no electrical force in the
z′ direction the induction eﬀect vanishes. Calculation of the electric force parallel to the
z′ axis using the RCED formula (3.4) gives a result consistent with the Lorentz force in
a) or by use of the Faraday-Lenz Law in either a) or b) [13].

Figure 6: Einstein’s light synchronisation procedure is carried out in the frame S’ (left
hand ﬁgures) and observed in the frams S (right hand ﬁgures). The lamps LA and LB in
S’ are triggered by the passage of the light signal in S’ and observed from S. a) left, τ ′ = 0,
light signal passes A, LA ﬁres. b) left τ ′ = L/c, light signal is reﬂected at the mirror at
B, LB ﬁres. d) left τ ′ = 2L/c, light signal arrives back at A, LA ﬁres a second time. The
events observed in S at the corresponding times τ = 0, τ = γL/c, τ ′ = 2γL/c are shown
in the right-hand ﬁgures in a), b), d), respectively. Also shown in a) c) and e) right are
the events in the frame S considered by Einstein, together with (left) the positions of the
light signal in S’ at the corresponding times. The position of the light signal is at the head
of the wavy arrow in each ﬁgure. In this ﬁgure β = c/2, γ = 2/√3.

Figure 7: a) a plane electromagnetic wave (a parallel beam of monochromatic photons) in
the x-y plane is incident at an angle φ on a plane mirror, M, with surface perpendicular
to the x-axis moving with uniform velocity v parallel to the latter. The number of photons
in the beam of y- and z-dimensions a striking the front surface of the mirror in time t is
proportional to the area ABCD. b) a parallel beam of monochromatic photons in the x-y
φ′′′ on the back surface! of the mirror M. The number
plane is incident at an angle π
of photons in the beam of y- and z-dimensions a striking the back surface of the mirror
is proportional to the area A”’B”’C”’D”’. Einstein incorrectly assumed that this was the
number of photons reﬂected from the front surface of the M in time t.

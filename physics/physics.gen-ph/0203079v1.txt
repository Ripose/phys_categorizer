Abstract

We re-examine the non Hermitian position coordinate of Dirac’s
equation, in the light of his own insights and conclude that this, and
the Dirac equation itself is symptomatic of an underlying Noncommu-
tative Geometry.

1 Introduction

Albert Einstein had once observed ”you know, it would be suﬃcient to really
understand the electron” [1]. At the turn of the Twentieth Century sev-
eral valiant attempts were made to model the electron in terms of Classical
Electrodynamics, but all these attempts ultimately failed[2]. As Wheeler
pointed out[3], the real challenge was to introduce into the theory the purely
Quantum Mechanical spin half of the electron. The ﬁrst successful theory
of the electron emerged with Dirac’s equation, which also at the same time
brought about the uniﬁcation of Quantum Theory with the Special Theory
of Relativity.
However the Dirac theory also encountered several problems. One of these
was that the position coordinate turned out to be complex or Non Hermitian,
and as we will see, a related problem, namely that the velocity of the electron
turned out to be the velocity of light. Dirac himself recognized the reason
for all this. He remarked[4], ”... since the theoretical velocity in the above
conclusion is the velocity at one instant of time while observed velocities are
always average velocities through appreciable time intervals...”, and again,

1

”To measure the velocity we must measure the position at two slightly dif-
ferent times and then divide the change of position by the time interval. (It
will not do to measure the momentum and apply a formula, as the ordinary
connection between velocity and momentum is not valid.) In order that our
measured velocity may approximate to the instantaneous velocity, the time
interval between the two measurements of position must be very short and
hence these measurements must be very accurate. The great accuracy with
which the position of the electron is known during the time-interval must
give rise, according to the principle of uncertainty, to an almost complete
indeterminacy in its momentum. This means that almost all values of the
momentum are equally probable, so that the momentum is almost certain to
be inﬁnite. An inﬁnite value for a component of momentum corresponds to
the value ±c for the corresponding component of velocity.”
This realization, which highlights the limitation of space time points in Quan-
tum Theory highlights the fact that we have to deal instead, with minimum
space time intervals, within which there are negative energy solutions and
the zitterbewegung type of unphysical eﬀects. On the other hand negative
energy components of the Dirac bi-spinor are negligible outside the Compton
scale. Thus the averaging prescribed by Dirac eliminates these components
and gives us back a physical theory in terms of Hermitian operators (Cf.[5]).
This realization is the seed of what in recent years has been termed a Non
Commutative Geometry.

2 Positive and Negative Energy Solutions

Let us consider in a little more detail[5] the implications of Dirac’s averaging
over the Compton scale.
We consider for simplicity, the free particle Dirac equation. The solutions
are of the type,

ψ = ψA + ψS

(1)

where

ψA = e

(3)

Equations (2) and (3) show that the negative energy and positive energy
solutions form a coherent Hilbert space and so the possibility of transition
to negative energy states exists. This diﬃculty however can be overcome by
the well known Hole theory which uses the Pauli exclusion principle, and is
described in many standard books on Quantum Mechanics.
However the last or interference term on the right side of (3) is like the
zitterbewegung term. When we remember that we really have to consider
averages over spacetime intervals of the order of ¯h/mc and ¯h/mc2, this term
disappears and eﬀectively the negative energy solutions and positive energy
solutions stand decoupled in what is now the physical universe.
In other
words, the Hole theory and other artiﬁces of point space time theory are
circumvented if, self consistently we use space time intervals instead of points.
The spirit of Dirac’s average spacetime intervals rather than spacetime points
has received attention over the years in the form of minimum spacetime
intervals– from the work of Snyder and Schild to Quantum Superstring theory
In modern language, it is symptomatic of a Non
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
commutative spacetime geometry which again brings out the nature of the
mysterious Quantum Mechanial spin [13, 14]. This is what we will brieﬂy
examine.

3 The Non commutative Structure

Very early on, Newton and Wigner [15] showed that the correct physical
coordinate operator is given by

xk = (1 + γ0)

3/2
p
0
(p0 + µ)1/2

ı∂
∂pk !

−

 

−1/2
0

p

(p0 + µ)1/2 P

where P is a projection operator eliminating negative energy components
and the gammas denote the usual Dirac matrices.
To appreciate the signiﬁcance of (4), let us consider the case of spin zero.
Then (4) becomes

xk = ı

∂
∂pk

+

1
8π Z

exp(−µ|(x − y|)
|x − y|

∂
∂y

dy

The ﬁrst term on the right side of (5) denotes the usual position operator,
but the second term represents an imaginary part, which has an extension
∼ 1/µ, the Compton wavelength, exactly as in the case of the Dirac electron.
Returning to Dirac’s treatment [4], the position coordinate is given by

~x =

+

ıc¯h(~α − c~pH

−1)H

−1 ≡

t + ˆx

(6)

c2pt
H

1
2

c2p
H

H being the Hamiltonian operator and α’s the non-commuting Dirac matri-
ces, given by

(4)

(5)

~α =

~σ 0
0 ~σ #

"

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (6) is the usual (Hermitian) position.
The second term of ~x is the small oscillatory term of the order of the Compton
wavelength, arising out of zitterbewegung eﬀects which averages out to zero.
On the other hand, if we were to work with the (non Hermitian) position
operator in (6), then we can easily verify that the following Non-commutative
geometry holds,

[xı, xj] = αıjl2

(7)

where αıj ∼ 0(1).
The relation (7) shows on comparison with the position-momentum commu-
tator that the coordinate ~x also behaves like a ”momentum”. This can be

4

seen directly from the Dirac theory itself where we have

c~α =

−

ˆxH

c2~p
H

2ı
¯h

(8)

In (8), the ﬁrst term gives the usual momentum. The second term is the
extra ”momentum” ~ˆp due to the relations (7).
Infact we can easily verify from (8) that
H 2
¯hc2 ˆx

~ˆp =

(9)

where ˆx has been deﬁned in (6).
Let us now see what the angular momentum ∼ ~x × ~p gives at the Compton
scale. Using (6), we can easily show that

(~x × ~p)z =

(~α × ~p)z =

(p2α1 − p1α2)

(10)

c
E

c
E

where E is the eigen value of the Hamiltonian operator H. The right side of
(10) is a super position of the α’s which again contain the Pauli σ matrices.
This shows that at the Compton scale, the angular momentum leads to the
”mysterious” Quantum Mechanical spin.
It may be mentioned that Zakruzewski [16] deduced from a diﬀerent point of
view that spin implies non commutativity. On the other hand, the zitterbe-
wegung contribution to spin has been shielded by Barut and coworkers and
Hestenes (Cf.ref.[5] and several references therein).
In the above considerations, we started with the Dirac equation and de-
duced the underlying Noncommutative geometry of spacetime. Interestingly,
starting with Snyder’s Non commutative geometry, based solely on Lorentz
invariance and a minimum spacetime length, at the Compton scale,

Lzetc.

[x, y] =

¯h
that is, in eﬀect starting with (7), it is possible to deduce the relations
(10),(9) and the Dirac equation itself as has been shown in detail elsewhere
[11, 16, 17, 18].
We have thus established the correspondence between considerations start-
ing from the Dirac theory of the electron and Snyder’s (and subsequent)
approaches based on a minimum spacetime interval and Lorentz covariance.
We will now show using Nelson’s analysis that that the above non commu-
tativity is also symptomatic of an underlying stochastic behaviour.

5

4 The Stochastic Underpinning

In Nelson’s approach[19, 20], there is a double Weiner process arising from
the fact that the forward and backward time derivatives,

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

d

d
dt−

∨ = V − ıU

x → x + ıx′

are unequal. Let us consider ﬁrst the problem in one dimension (Cf.[20])) we
have

From (12) we deﬁne two new velocities

d+
dt

x(t) = b+ ,

x(t) = b−,

d−
dt

V =

b+ + b−
2

; U =

b+ − b−
2

It may be pointed out that in general U, given in (13) vanishes while V gives
the usual velocity. It is now possible to introduce a complex velocity

From (14) it appears that the coordinate x goes over to a complex coordinate

This is also true for the Dirac equation (6). Infact it can be shown that this
leads to the special relativistic metric in 1 + 1 dimensions [5].
Following this line of reasoning, in the usual theory, as is well known we work
with (14) to deduce the Schrodinger equation. This could be done in three
dimensions also.
But let us now look upon (15) from a diﬀerent angle and ask, ”Can we
generalise (15) itself to the three dimensional case?” It is known [21] that in
this case, surprisingly,

(1, ı) → (I, ~σ)

(16)

where I is the unit 2 × 2 matrix and ~σ are the Pauli matrices. We get the
Lorentz invariant metric at the same time.
Equation (16) gives a quarternionic description (Cf.[21]). It would lead to a
two component neutrino type equation. However this 2 × 2 description does

6

not preserve spatial and time reﬂections, which are necessary in physical
theories. If we incorporate these reﬂections also then it is known that [22]
we get the 4 × 4 Dirac description and the non commutative geometry [13]

[xı, xj] = l2Θıj

(17)

where l represents a length scale. Equation (17) is, ofcourse, the same as (7)!
All this need not be surprising - equation (6) represents the zitterbewegung
eﬀects due to the interference of the negative and positive energy solutions.
The positive and negative time derivatives (11) of the double Weiner process
described above represent exactly the positive and negative energy interfer-
ence eﬀects, contained in the term U of (13). (It is these interference terms
which, even in the non relativistic Nelsonian theory lead to the Quantum
Mechanical Schrodinger equation).
The important point to note is that whenever we have a complex space co-
ordinate as in (15), then the generalization to three dimensions, infact leads
to (16) and non commutativity.
There is another very interesting and apparently diﬀerent situation where
complex coordinates are used - this is in the derivation of the Kerr-Newman
metric [23, 24, 25]. In this case we consider the Maxwell equations,

~∇ × ~W = ı ~W , ~∇ · ~W = 0

(18)

where

~W = ~E + ı ~B
~E and ~B being the usual electric and magnetic components of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. The interesting point is that if we eﬀect an imaginary
shift of the coordinates, then we obtain the Quantum Mechanical electron
anomalous gyro magnetic ratio g = 2 of the Kerr-Newman metric (Cf.[23]
for details). Newman himself found this association of the imaginary spatial
shift with Quantum Mechanical spin inexplicable [26]. However in the light
of the above comments the connection between the two becomes clear (Cf.
also [27]). Infact this leads to a model of the electron as a Kerr-Newman
black hole, with the naked singularity shielded by a fuzzyness induced by the
non commutativity (17) as was independantly conﬁrmed by Nottale [28].
For completeness we mention that interestingly, as is well known, the hydro-
dynamical formulation of Quantum Mechanics also leads to equations similar

7

to the Nelsonian formulation (Cf.[5] for a brief review). Here also if we con-
sider a one dimensional laminar ﬂow we get a velocity that is both solenoidal
and irrotational and satisﬁes

~∇ · ~V = 0,

~∇ × ~V = 0

(19)

From (19) we can deﬁne a complex velocity potential by standard methods
which again leads to complex coordinates (15) and ultimately we end up with
(17).
We ﬁnally observe that a phase space approach based on relations like (15)
has been worked out in detail by Kaiser [29, 30], though he does not follow the
route through (16), and therefore does not arrive at the above conclusions.
One can see that equation (9) also suggests this approach. Nevertheless it is
interesting to note that in this reverse approach in which we introduce com-
plex coordinates the zitterbewegung as manifested in the complex coordinate
ˆx of (6) disappears.

5 Conclusion

Thus the purely Quantum Mechanical ”mysterious” spin half is symptomatic
of non commutativity and vice versa. Interestingly, this is also symptomatic
of an underlying double Weiner or stochastic process.

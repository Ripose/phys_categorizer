Abstract

In this paper, a method of measuring the entropy is presented. Problems related

to the entropy and the heat are also discussed.

1 Introduction

Among the branches of classical physics, thermodynamics and statistical physics should
be the most fantastic ones, which have attracted so many great minds to devote their
lives and energy to investigating every topic in these ﬁelds. Perhaps among the branches
of classical physics, they are the only ones that leave so many open questions, not only in
the ﬁeld of application, but also in their foundations.

In the last century, most of the physicists were attracted to the quantized physics,
which can be viewed as the opposite side of classical physics. Although quantization
has been the principal melody of physics ever since then, thermodynamics and statistical
physics are still vivid with their own open questions. And, even in the so-called modern
physics, shadows of thermodynamics and statistical physics are also seen: In the black
hole theory, black holes are endowed with the temperature and the entropy[1].
Ideas
and concepts of thermodynamics and statistical physics are also applied to the condensed
matter theory and the string theory[2]. In fact, the history of quantum theory can be
traced back to thermodynamics and statistical physics, where M. Planck use the famous
assumption E = hν to derive Planck’s formula[3], the spectral energy distribution of black
bodies.

On the other hand, there are so many open questions in thermodynamics as well as
statistical physics — there are even no universal theories, neither thermodynamic nor

statistical, for non-equilibrium systems. Thus the foundations of thermodynamics, which
are claimed to be valid for arbitrary thermal systems and arbitrary processes, could not
be tested by comparing the experimental data with the predictions from a universal
thermodynamics. This sounds not so nice to the society of physics.

It will beneﬁt us greatly if we exam the foundations of thermodynamics carefully,
no matter theoretically or experimentally. For example, if we were able to measure the
entropy of a system in an arbitrary given state, it would be a piece of good news. However,
whenever we try to fulﬁll such a scheme, we always ﬁnd that there are some confusing
points or experimental obstacles in thermodynamics, standing in the way to prevent us
from approaching to our goal.

In this paper, a method is given as how to measure the entropy of a system in an
arbitrary given state. In order to simplify our discussion, we assume it to be a gas system
consisting of only one kind of molecules, with equilibrium states being labeled by its
temperature T , its volume V and the amount n of its molecules measured in the unit of
moles. As implied, such a system is an open system.

According to thermodynamics, a reversible process is adiabatic if and only if the
entropy of the system is “conserved”, or, invariant, in the process. This statement is
theoretically explicit, but it is hard to be applied in experiments. Usually a process is
judged to be adiabatic empirically or a priori. In a thermodynamic measurement, one
often wants to assure that a process is adiabatic, or that certain a system, which may
consist of the system to be measured as well as some part of its surroundings, is thermally
isolated from other surroundings. Hence, in thermodynamics, the error in a measurement
concerning heat or thermodynamic functions are hard to be estimated quantitatively.

The situation becomes rather worse in the case of open systems because the concept of
an adiabatic process is much far away from our heuristic ideas. Whenever the amount of
molecules is changed in a reversible process, the entropy accompanying the molecules that
is brought into or out of the open system accounts for certain part of the change of the
entropy of the open system. As a matter of fact, an adiabatic reversible process, namely,
a reversible process which remains the entropy invariant, will be peculiar from the point
of view of empiricism: A reversible process that seems not to absorb or emit heat is not
adiabatic provided the amount of molecules is changing. The detailed analysis is presented
in §2.2, implying that there are serious problems in the theory of thermodynamics. But
this will not be the topic of this paper.

The concept of heat thus is made confusing. It arises to be a question whether we
can measure the heat correctly if one of the amounts of the components of a system is
changed in a process. If there is no problem, then the method in this paper can be applied
to measure the entropy of a system state by state.
This paper is organized as in the following.

In §2, some points that might cause
confusion or arguments are made clear ﬁrst. Especially, the entropy of an open system, as
well as the heat absorbed by it, is analyzed. It seems that the theory of thermodynamics
of reversible processes is not compatible with the thermodynamic laws. It is indeed the
case[4], but this is not the topic of this paper. In §3, we ﬁrst outline of the method of
how to measure the entropy of an equilibrium gas system. Then the formulas are derived
in details. In §4, conclusions and further discussions are given.

For those who are interested in the measuring methods, §3.1 is what the wanted.
Those who want to see the detailed derivation may ﬁnd it in §3.2. If there is any question

about these contents, then §2 is referred to.

2 Problems That Should Be Made Clear

Before we start to discuss how the entropy could be measured, some problems should be
made clear because the author astonishingly ﬁnds that there are so much misunderstand-
ing when the topic of this paper is discussed. Those who does not want to quarrel with
me, when he or she is reading the next section, may safely skip the following contents in
this section. But when he or she feels eager to quarrel with me, I beg him or her to read
this section carefully before he or she comes up to me.

In this paper, we only discuss the open systems consisting of one kind of molecules,
with the amount denoted by n in the unit of moles. For simplicity, we assume that the
system is a ﬂuid system.

First let me emphasize that the correctness of thermodynamics of reversible processes
should never be questioned in this paper, because I am trying to give some possible
experimental methods, in its framework, of how to measure the entropy of a system in
an equilibrium state. From the discussions, it can be revealed that there are some serious
questions rooted deeply in thermodynamics. However, in order for the outline of this
paper to be clear, the correctness of thermodynamics should never be suspected.

2.1 The Absolute Entropy and the Third Law of Thermody-

namics

Perhaps someone wants to remind me that, in thermodynamics, functions such as the
internal energy U and the entropy S can be determined only up to a constant, hence it
should be suspected immediately that the absolute entropy, while not the change of it,
could be measured.

However, one should recall that it is not the case, at all. When any one of the
thermodynamic potentials such as the internal energy U, the enthalpy H = U + pV ,
the Helmholtz free energy F = U − T S or the Gibbs free energy G = U + pV − T S,
et al, is assumed to be additive and to be a homogeneous function of the ﬁrst degree
in its corresponding extensive variables, the arbitrariness of all the constants in these
potentials and the entropy function ends up. For example, when G(T, p, n) is assumed to
be a homogeneous function of the ﬁrst degree in n, it can be obtained that[5, 6]

by using Euler’s theorem for homogeneous functions. Hence U, H and F are all obtained
as in the following:

G = µn

U(V, S, n) = −pV + T S + µn,
H(p, S, n) = T S + µn,
F (T, V, n) = −pV + µn.

S = −

(2)

Since dF = −p dV − S dT + µ dn, the entropy

is also determined1, being a homogeneous function of the ﬁrst degree in V and n. Such
an entropy is what is suggested to be measured in this paper.

Someone may argue that this would make the third law of thermodynamics unnec-
essary. Is that true? Of course, no, because this is not the business that third law of
thermodynamics can do. There are other conclusions, such as that the absolute zero of
temperature cannot be reached by any ﬁnite process, that are not available without the
third law.

Since there are various versions of the third law in literature, it is not strange that
there are lots of gentlemen who think that the third law can be used to determine the
integral constants in entropy2. Here we state the third law as that in [5]: For a system,
S is a constant value that is independent of any variables such as the
the limit S0 = lim
T →0
volume V , the pressure p and the amount n, et al. It is in this sense that the determination
of S0 is not the business of the third law only.

The third law of the thermodynamics concerns only the asymptotic behavior of the
entropy. It is a relatively independent thing to determine the constant S0 for a system.
S = 0 as soon as the
Unfortunately, in the literature it is often boldly assumed that lim
T →0
third law has been described. Even Sommerfeld could not prevent from doing so[5]. One
S = 0 contradict with the assumption such as
may ask the author who did so: Dose lim
T →0
that the Helmholtz free energy F is a homogeneous function of the ﬁrst degree in extensive
variables V and n, et al ? If no, is such an assumption independent of the third law?

In fact, lim
T →0

S = 0 is a corollary of such an assumption together with the third law:
According to eq. (2), S0(V, n) = lim
S(T, V, n) is a homogeneous function of V and n,
T →0
say. At the same time, it is a constant as asserted by the third law of thermodynamics.
Hence, using Euler’s theorem, we obtain

S0 =

V +

n = 0.

∂S0

∂n

To my opinion, the assumption that a particular thermodynamic potential is a homoge-
neous function in its corresponding extensive variables is and must be independent of the
third law. One may name such an assumption as the fourth law of thermodynamics, if
he likes to. As a consequence, the belief that each of thermodynamic potentials as well as
the entropy can be determined only up to a constant3 is incorrect.

1 To be more conﬁrmative, suppose that S′ = S +S0 is another possible entropy for the same system in
the same state, with S0 a constant. Then we obtain another Gibbs free energy G′ = G − T S0 = µn − T S0,
which is no longer a homogeneous function in n whenever S0 6= 0. Constants in other functions can be
similarly discussed.

2 For example, it is written in the famous book[7] of L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, saying that the
entropy of any system vanishes at the absolute zero of temperature. According to A. Sommerfeld, however,
W. Nernst disliked the concept of entropy[5]. If so, it seems that the description of Nernst’s theorem
in [7] is not a faithful version of Nernst’s original statement. And, whatsoever speaking, Sommerfeld’s
description is the representative of the version that is widely accepted, although, in spirit, it is equivalent
to Landau and Lifshitz’s statement in [7]. As for the reason why they are equivalent, see the next two
paragraphs.

3 Strictly speaking, the potentials F and G both have two constants before they are ﬁxed. For example,
let S and S′ = S + S0 describe the same system in the same state, and let the internal energies U and
U ′ = U + U0 describe also the same system in the same state. Then the corresponding Helmholtz free

2.2 The Entropy and the Heat

How to calculate the heat that is absorbed by an open system? If the process is reversible,
then, according to thermodynamics, the heat absorbed by the open system is ¯dQ = T dS
where dS is the total diﬀerential of the entropy of that open system. The answer is
so simple that it seems absurd to ask such a question. However, the following analysis
indicates that the so-called adiabatic process, which is a reversible process with the entropy
S remaining to be constant, is not a process as we have expected from the word adiabatic.

First let us consider a simple example.
Suppose that there is a ﬂuid system consists of one kind of molecules amounted as n0.
The system is in equilibrium at a temperature T and a volume V0. Then, according to
the zeroth law of thermodynamics, there should be no heat transferred from one part of
it to another. Meanwhile, the internal energy of this system is U0 = −pV0 + T S0 + µn0
where S0 is the entropy of the system, as indicated by eq. (1).

Now let us consider a subsystem of it which has a virtual boundary that separates the
subsystem from the whole. Suppose that the virtual boundary of the subsystem expands
slowly such that the center of mass remains unchanged and the process can be considered
as reversible. The subsystem is obviously an open system, whose state is denoted by
(T, V, n) with an entropy S = S(T, V, n).

Since the virtual boundary and the process are just imaginary, the intensive quantities
p, T and µ are constant. Assume the initial and the ﬁnal states of the subsystem are
(T, V1, n1) and (T, V1 + ∆V, n1 + ∆n), respectively, then

∆V
V0

=

∆S
S0

=

∆n

.

(3)

Hence, according to the formulism of thermodynamics, certain amount of heat Q =
T ∆S 6= 0 must be absorbed by the subsystem after its virtual expansion.
In other
words, as a virtual closed surface moves in an equilibrium system, one has to admit that
certain an amount of heat as ¯dQ = T dS has been transferred through it, accompanying
the substance that goes through the surface, even though the system is in equilibrium.

Then questions arise immediately. First, we have seen that the above subsystem,
separated by a virtual surface, does absorb some heat if its volume has been changed. On
the other hand, however, the zeroth law of thermodynamics should have repelled such a
possibility, because heat will not be transferred between two systems or two parts of a
system provided there is no diﬀerence of temperature. Secondly, ever since the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics was accepted, heat has been treated as a form of energy transfer, being
no longer anything accompanying the ordinary substance as that was insisted in the caloric
theory. Now it seems that the caloric theory is somehow restored in thermodynamics.

So, there are serious questions in thermodynamics. We leave these questions to be
discussed in [4]. However, we must make our view points to these questions clear before
we perform further discussions.

(1) For a system, the heat absorbed by it in a reversible process is always calculated to
be ¯dQ = T dS, no matter whether it is an open system or not. To say a reversible process
energies will be F = U − T S and F ′ = U ′ − T S′ = F + U0 − T S0, respectively. The same thing happens
in the Gibbs free energy: G′ = G + U0 − T S0. Rigorously, all the potentials can be determined up to at
most two constants before they are ﬁxed: One comes from the internal energy, and the other comes from
the entropy.

is adiabatic, it is equivalent to say that dS = 0 in the process. As a consequence, in order
that a reversible process is adiabatic if certain a number of molecules have been brought
into the system, it must emit a suitable quantity of heat into the surroundings, because
the newly added molecules always tend to increase the total entropy of the open system.
Therefore the concept of adiabatic processes is far away from what we have expected
intuitively. As for how a process can be identiﬁed to be adiabatic in the experiments, it is
not the topic of this paper.

(2) For simplicity, we only discuss open systems consist of only one kind of molecules.
When the amount n of the molecules in the open system are changed, the contribution of
the newly added molecules to the entropy has been included in dS, because S depends on
n, too, as shown in eq. (2). If the amount of molecules in the system remains constant,
the change of entropy in a reversible process is given by

For a reversible process in which the amount n is changing, the contribution of the added
molecules is

and the total diﬀerential of the entropy, dS, is the sum of the above two parts. In terms
of dS, the contribution of the added molecules needs not to be considered any more.

As an example, let us consider the ﬂuid system with an open subsystem enclosed by
a virtual boundary, as introduced formerly. When the virtual boundary is changed, the
total change of the entropy of the subsystem consists of two parts:

Due to the fact that dV

yielding

(3) Is heat a kind of substance accompanying ordinary matter, as it was said in the
old-fashioned caloric theory, or just the energy transferred from one body to another as
the result of the diﬀerence of temperature? As we know, thermodynamics has chosen the
latter. But the following consideration will make thermodynamics to sink into trouble.

consists of two parts: the ordinary part CV,n dT + T ( ∂S
∂V )T,ndV and the heat “brought into
the system by dn”, T ( ∂S
∂n )T,V dn. The latter makes the heat something like the companion
of the ordinary substances. Thus, reasonably, some of us will feel uncomfortable because
the spirit of the caloric theory is found wandering in thermodynamics. But we do not
want to discuss it, but leaving it into [4].

3 How to Measure the Entropy

3.1 The Outline of the Measuring Methods

For simplicity we only consider the gas systems, each of which consists of only one kind
of molecules. For such a system, its equilibrium state can be speciﬁed by three variables,
the absolute temperature T , the volume V , and the amount n of the molecules, say. Then
there are the equations of state for such a system. One of these equations is p = p(T, V, n),
which can be obtained state by state. The partial derivatives of p with respect to T , V
and n, respectively, can also be measured state by state.

In order to measure the entropy S = S(T, V, n) of such a system in a given state

(T, V, n), suppose that there is a reversible isothermal process

T = constant,

V = V (n).

Let (T, V, n) and (T, V + dV, n + dn) be the states in the above process, with ¯dQ the heat
that is absorbed by the system. Then the entropy of the system in the state (T, V, n) is

S(T, V, n) =

Therefore the entropy can be obtained provided that ¯dQ has been obtained. Especially,
if the process is both isothermal and adiabatic, namely, T = constant and ¯dQ = 0, the
entropy in the state (T, V, n) will be

3.2 The Principles of the Experiment

As we know, for a gas system, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics can be written in the form
of

dU = −p dV + T dS + µ dn.

A Legendre transformation gives the diﬀerential of the free energy as

dF = −p dV − S dT + µ dn,

(8)

where the free energy is deﬁned as F = U − T S. Being a homogeneous function of the
ﬁrst degree in V and n for any given temperature T , Euler’s theorem for homogeneous
functions of the ﬁrst degree must be satisﬁed, in which the temperature is treated as a
parameter, giving

F = −pV + µn.
(9)
The optional form of the above equation can be U = −pV + T S + µn for the internal
energy, or[6] G = µn for the Gibbs free energy, as what have been mentioned in §2.1.

One of the most important consequences of the above equations is that the intensive
quantities p, T and µ are not functionally independent, namely, their diﬀerentials are
constrained by an equation

dµ =

dp −

dT.

V
n

S
n

(10)

(11)

In fact, it can be obtained by the comparison of the diﬀerential of eq. (9) with eq. (8).
The above equation implies that the chemical potential µ is a function of the intensive
variables p and T . Since the pressure p can be viewed as a function of the variables T , V
and n, we can obtain

V
n (cid:18)
by using the chain rule of partial derivatives.

By virtue of the above equation, the heat that is absorbed by an open system in a

reversible process reads

¯dQ = T dS = CV,n dT + T

∂p
∂T (cid:19)V,n
in which the partial derivatives of the entropy S with respect to V and n, respectively,
have been replaced by the partial derivatives of p and −µ, both with respective to T ,

4 Conclusions and Discussions

In §2.1, it was concluded that the concept of abstract entropy makes sense in thermody-
namics. So there should be some methods to measure the entropy. The method presented
in this paper is one of them.

As we have indicated in §3, were it possible that (1) we can design an inﬁnitesimal
reversible process that is isothermal with the amount n of molecules being changed and
that (2) we can measure the heat absorbed by the open system in this process, then the
entropy of the system can be measured. If, (3) in addition, the inﬁnitesimal process is
adiabatic, it could not be better.

However, we have seen in §2.2 that the concept of heat in thermodynamics is not so
simple as it looks. It seems to be a question whether we can measure the heat if, in the
process, any one of the amounts of the components is changed. This is due to the fact, in
thermodynamics, that the molecules that are brought into or out of an open system are
accompanied with certain a quantity of heat, as shown in the example of the subsystem
of an equilibrium ﬂuid system (see, §2.2). As a consequence, it can be asked whether the
method presented in this paper is practical.

We must notice that, in order to measure the entropy S(T, V, n) in a given state
(T, V, n), one process satisfying the conditions (1) and (2) in the above is suﬃcient. If
there is no such a reversible process, we may refer to thermodynamics as a theory speaking
of nothing. As long as we believe in thermodynamics, we have to admit that the method
of measuring the entropy is reasonable and practical.

It is in this sense that the entropy can be measured.

TOWARDS THE UNIFICATION OF
FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS

Abstract

Recent observations of distant supernovae show that the universe,
contrary to popular belief, is expanding for ever. Similarly, recent ex-
periments at the Superkamiokande facility demonstrate that the Neu-
trino has a non vanishing mass. Both these discoveries necessitate,
at the very least, a re-examination of conventional theories–the Big
Bang Theory and the Standard Model. On the other hand, neither
has quantum gravity yielded the desired results, nor can String The-
ory be taken as the last word.
We brieﬂy examine this scenario, and in this light consider the recent
description of Fermions in terms of the Kerr-Newman metric and the
related model of Fluctuational Cosmology. All this is not only con-
sistent with known physics including the latest results alluded to, but
also explains hitherto inexplicable empirical facts like the handedness
of the Neutrino or the large number relations of Cosmology and so
on. It is shown that this scheme leads to a uniﬁed description of the
fundamental interactions. At the same time, pleasingly, we recover
the usual quark picture at the Compton wavelength scale and the Big
Bang scenario at the Planck scale.

1 Introduction

”....the aim is to see complete nature as diﬀerent aspects of one
set of phenomena...”. This is a quotation not from the Up-
anishads but from the celebrated twentieth century Physicist
Richard P. Feynman[1]. This has been the goal pursued over
the millennia in man’s quest for an understanding of the uni-
verse. Today looking back we can see the logic of Occam’s razor
or an economy of hypothesis– a far cry from the times of pre
history when one God was designated for each phenomenon of
nature.
In the words of F.J. Dyson[2], ”.... the very greatest scientists
in each discipline are uniﬁers. This is especially true in Physics.
Newton and Einstein were supreme as uniﬁers. The great tri-
umphs of Physics have been triumphs of uniﬁcation. We almost
take it for granted that the road of progress in Physics will be
a wider and wider uniﬁcation...”.
However at this time when we seem to be on the threshold of the
Theory of Everything (TOE), there are a few cautionary tales
which I would like to recount, and whose signiﬁcance we will
encounter shortly.
The ﬁrst is a sense of perfection and aesthetics, so much a part
of scientiﬁc philosophy from the Greeks, for example Plato to
twentieth century Physicists, for example Dirac. Thus to the
Greeks the circle or sphere were perfect, because of their all
round symmetry and so all planetary orbits had to be circular.
The very word orbit is derived from ”orb” which is Greek for
circle. This lead to the very complicated epicyclic model of the
Greeks which dominated science for nearly 2000 years, till al-
most the 17th century. As observations improved and revealed

2

discrepancies in the Greek model, more and more epicycles were
added to bring theory in tune with observation.
It was only
when Kepler around 1608 ﬁnally introduced his elliptical orbits,
that the Greek umbilical cord had ﬁnally been cut and modern
science emerged. Clearly the Greeks were trying to approximate
a single elliptical motion by a series of complicated circular mo-
tions.
The second incident also involves Kepler who thought that he
had found the answer to the question, ”why are there only ﬁve
planets besides the earth?” Undoubtedly the creator had used
the ﬁve perfect polyhedra as celestial scaﬀolding, in building up
the universe[3]. This idea was not just attractive, but to Kepler
it was breathtaking.
The third story comes from India and is recounted in the fa-
mous English poem, ”The Five Blind Men of Hindustan”. Each
of the blind men felt an elephant, and ofcourse immediately un-
derstood what the elephant was like: It was like a rope, it was
like the trunk of a tree and so on.
Let us now come back to modern science. Sir Isaac Newton
was the ﬁrst great uniﬁer. He discovered the Universal Law of
Gravitation: The force which kept the moon going round the
earth, or the earth round the sun and the force which kept bi-
nary stars going around each other and so on were all basically
the same force of gravitation which brought apples down from
a tree. This apart his Laws of Motion were also universal.
In the 19th Century the work of the likes of Faraday and Am-
pere show the close connection between the apparently totally
dissimilar forces of electricity and magnetism. These studies cul-
minated in the work of Maxwell who uniﬁed not just electricity
and magnetism but optics as well.

3

Another great uniﬁcation of the last Century was that of Ther-
modynamics and the kinetic theory of gases[4].
In the early part of this Century Einstein fused space and time,
giving them an inseparable identity. He went on to unify space-
time with gravitation in his General Theory of Relativity. How-
ever he and subsequent scientists failed in what may be called
Einstein’s IDEE FIXE, namely the uniﬁcation of electromag-
netism and gravitation.
Yet another uniﬁcation in this century, which often is not recog-
nised as such is the fusion of Quantum Mechanics and Special
Relativity by Dirac, through his celebrated equation of the elec-
tron.
Some thirty years ago, another uniﬁcation took place due to the
work of Salam, Weinberg, Glashow and others– the uniﬁcation
of electromagnetism with the weak forces. This is the story to
which we now come.
The weak force is one of two forces, the other being the strong
force, discovered during this Century itself. Studies and work
earlier this Century revealed that there seem to be three basic
particles in the universe, the protons, the neutrons and the elec-
trons.
While the proton and the electron interact via the electromag-
netic force, in the absence of this force the proton and the neu-
tron appear to be a pair or a doublet, because now the dis-
tinction between the electrically charged proton and the neutral
neutron disappears. However the proton and the neutral neu-
tron interact via ”strong forces”, forces which are stronger than
the electromagnetic but have a much shorter range of just about
10−
The existence of the neutrino was postulated by Pauli in 1930 to

13cms.

explain the decay of the neutron, and it was discovered by Reines
and Cowan in 1955. The weak force is associated with neutrino
16cms. The
type particles and has an even shorter range, 10−
neutrino itself has turned out to be one of the most enigmatic
of particles, with peculiar characteristics, the most important of
which is its handedness. This handedness property appears to
be crucial for weak forces.
Later work revealed that while particles like the electron and
neutrino, namely the leptons may be truly elementary, other
particles like protons and neutrons may be composite, infact
made up of still smaller objects called quarks – six in all[5]. To-
day it is believed that the quarks interact via the strong forces.
It must be mentioned that all these ”particles”, or loosely ma-
terial particles are fermions, that is they have half integral spin.
It was realized that the forces or interactions on the other hand
are mediated by messengers like photons which are bosons, that
is, have integral spin.
According to contemporary thinking, the uniﬁcation of the vari-
ous interactions relies on the fact that the messengers have spin
one, that is are gauge forces, where as in this sense gravitation
is not a gauge force as it is thought to be mediated by spin 2
particles.
To picturize the above let us consider the interaction between a
proton and an electron.

5

A proton could be imagined to emit a photon which is then ab-
sorbed by the electron.
Instead of a single mediating particle we could think of multi-
plets, all having equal masses. With group theoretical inputs,
one could shortlist, singlets with one particle like the photon
triplets, octets and so on as possible candidates.
Motivated by the analogy of electromagnetism mediated by the
spin one photon, it was realized in the 1950s that the W + and
W − bosons could be possible candidates for the mediation of
the weak force. However there had to be one more messenger
so that there would be an allowable triplet alluded to earlier.
It was suggested by Ward and Salam that the third candidate
could be the photon itself, which would then provide not only a
description of the weak force but would also unify it with elec-
tromagnetism. However while the W particles were massive, the
photon was massless so that they could not form a triplet. So a
heavy photon or Z 0 was postulated to make up a triplet, while
the photon was also used for the purpose of uniﬁcation, and
moreover a mixing of Z 0 and the photon was required for what
has been called renormalization, that is the removal of inﬁnities.
The question was how could the photon be massless while the
W and Z particles would be massive? It was suggested that this
could be achieved through the spontaneous breaking of symme-
try. For example a bar magnet when heated, looses its mag-
netism, that is it becomes symmetric because one cannot dis-
tinguish between the North and South poles. However as the
magnet cools down, the magnetism or the polarity or assymetry
is regained spontaneously. In other words there would be a phase
transition (from symmetry to asymmetry).
In our case, before the spontaneous breaking of symmetry or

6

1015◦

the phase transition, the W s, Zs and the photon would all be
massless. After the phase transition, while the photons remain
mass less, the others would acquire mass. This phase transition
would occur at temperatures
Centigrade. At higher
∼
temperatures there would be a single electroweak force. As the
temperature falls to the above level electromagnetism and weak
forces would separate out. Clearly the direction to proceed ap-
peared to be to identify the guage character of the strong force–
mediated by spin one particles, the gluons. This force binds the
diﬀerent quarks to produce the diﬀerent elementary particles,
other than the leptons. This is the standard model. However
we have not yet conclusively achieved a uniﬁcation of the elec-
troweak force and the strong force[6].
One proceeds by analogy with the electroweak uniﬁcation to
obtain a new guage force that has been called by Jogesh Pati
and Abdus Salam as the electro nuclear force, or in a similar
It
scheme the Grand Uniﬁed Force by Glashow and Georgi.
must be mentioned that one of the predictions is that of the
proton would decay with a long life time of about 1032 years,
very much more than the age of the universe itself. However we
are near a situation where this should be observable.
The recent super Kamiokande determination of neutrino mass
is the ﬁrst evidence of Physics beyond the standard model. In-
terestingly in this theory we would also require a right handed
neutrino in this case.
Meanwhile extended particles had come into vogue from about
twenty years with string theory. Starting oﬀ with objects of
the size of the Compton wavelength, the theory of superstrings
33cms. We have
now deals with the Planck length of about 10−
noted that all interactions except gravitation are generalizations

7

of the electromagnetic guage theory. String theory combines
Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity
- we need ten, (9 + 1), dimensions for quantizing strings, and we
also get a mass less particle of spin two which is the mediator
of the gravitational force. This way there is the possibility of
unifying all interactions including gravitation. Further, in the
above ten dimensions there are no divergences– this is because
the spatial extension of the string fudges the singularities. How-
ever, we require, for veriﬁcation of the string model, energies

1018mP , as against the presently available 103mP .

∼
Another interesting feature of string theory is duality. There are
ﬁve diﬀerent solutions (compactiﬁcations) leading to the same
physical picture reminiscent of the ”Five Blind Men of Hindus-
tan”. These ﬁve theories are but diﬀerent descriptions of a single
theory.
The exotic dimensions, the large number of solutions and the
non veriﬁable nature of the theory are some of the unsatis-
factory features of this development, just as the 18 arbitrary
parameters[7], and the unseen monopoles are some of the unsat-
isfactory features of the standard model.

2 A New Model Towards Uniﬁcation

In previous communications[8, 9, 10] a model for leptons as Kerr-
Newman type Black Holes was developed, and it was pointed out
that several hitherto inexplicable features turned out to have a
natural explanation, for example the quantum of charge, the
electromagnetic-gravitational interaction ratio, the handedness
of the neutrino and so on. We brieﬂy recapitulate some relevant

8

facts.
It must be mentioned that the possibility that a particle could be
a Schwarzchild black hole has been examined earlier by Markov,
Motz and others[11, 12] and leads to a high particle mass of
5gm, the Planck mass without much insight into other prop-
10−
erties.
So let us approach the problem from a diﬀerent angle. We con-
sider a charged Dirac (spin half) particle. If we treat this as a
spinning black hole, there is an immediate problem:The horizon
of the Kerr-Newman black hole becomes in this case, complex[9],

where G is the gravitational constant, M the mass and a

naked singularity apparently contradicting the cosmic censor-
ship conjecture. However, in the Quantum Mechanical domain,
(1) can be seen to be meaningful.
Infact, the position coordinate for a Dirac particle is given by

and similar equations for y and z where a1 is an arbitrary con-
stant and cα1 is the velocity operator with eigen values
c. The
real part in (2) is the usual position while the imaginary part
arises from zitterbewegung. Interestingly, in both (1) and (2),
¯h
the imaginary part is of the order of
mc, the Compton wave-
length, and leads to an immediate identiﬁcation of these two
equations. We must remember that our physical measurements
are gross as indeed is required by the Uncertainity Principle

±

9

∼

- they are really measurements averaged over a width of the
¯h
order
mc. Similarly, time measurements are imprecise to the
¯h
mc2 . Very precise measurements if possible, would im-
tune
ply that all Dirac particles would have the velocity of light, or
in the Quantum Field Theory atleast of fermions, would lead
to divergences. (This is closely related to the non-Hermiticity
of position operators in relativistic theory as can be seen from
equation (2) itself. Physics as pointed out begins after an av-
eraging over the above unphysical space-time intervals. In the
process (cf.ref. [9]), the imaginary or non-Hermitian part of the
position operator in (2) disappears. That is the above naked
singularity is fudged or shielded by a Quantum Mechanical cen-
sor, namely the minimum Compton scales.
We observe that if we adhoc treat a Dirac particle as a Kerr-
Newman black hole of mass m, charge e and spin ¯h
2 . The grav-
itational and electromagnetic ﬁelds at a distance are given by

which is correct. Infact, (3) also leads to the electron’s anoma-
lous gyromagnetic ratio g = 2.!
We next examine more closely, this identiﬁcation of a Dirac par-
ticle with a Kerr-Newman black hole. We reverse the arguments
after equation (2) which lead from the complex or non-Hermitian
coordinate operators to Hermitian ones: We consider instead the
displacement,

In the case of the electon, we can verify that the equality (5) is
satisﬁed:
We follow the classical picture of a particle as a rotating shell
with velocity c, as indeed is suggested by the Compton wave-
length cut oﬀ and which will be further justiﬁed in the sequel.
The electrostatic potential inside a spherical shell of radius ′a′
is,

That is, we get the rationale for this fundamental relation, which
no longer turns out to be accidental. In any case, we can now
see the connection between the charge, mass and the velocity of
light.
(It may be noted in passing that in the usual displacement op-
erator theory ([13]) the operators like d
dt are indeterminate
to the extent of a purely imaginary additive constant which is
adjusted against the Hermiticity of the operators concerned).
We next consider the spatial part of (4), viz.,

dx or d

given the fact that the particle is now seen to have the charge e
(and mass m). As is well known[15], this leads in General Rel-
ativity from the static Kerr metric to the Kerr-Newman metric
where the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁeld of the particle
is given by (3), including the anomalous factor g = 2. In General
Relativity, the complex transformation (4) and the subsequent
emergence of the Kerr-Newman metric has no clear explanation.
Nor the fact that, as noted by Newman[16] spin is the orbital
angular momentum with an imaginary shift of origin. But in
the Quantum Mechanical context, We can see the rationale: the
origin of (4) lies in the QMBH.
More speciﬁcally, the temporal part of the transformation (4)

12

−

leads to the appearance of charge in (5). The space part then,
as is known leads to the Kerr-Newman metric.
Ever since Einstein put forward his theory of Gravitation in
1915, a problem that has vexed physicists including Einstein
himself is the incorporation of electromagnetism into the theory
of gravitation. Einstein himself said it all in his Staﬀord Little
Lectures delivered in May 1921 at Princeton University[17], ”...
if we introduce the energy tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
into the right hand side of (the gravitational ﬁeld equation) we
obtain (the ﬁrst of Maxwell’s systems of equations in tensor
ds =)τ µ = 0,... This
density form), for the special case (√
inclusion of the theory of electricity in the scheme of General
Relativity has been considered arbitrary and unsatisfactory.... a
theory in which the gravitational ﬁeld and the electromagnetic
ﬁeld do not enter as logically distinct structures would be much
preferable...”
The very early attempt of Hermann Weyl to which we will re-
turn very brieﬂy failed for this reason. As Einstein put it[17],
”H. Weyl, and recently Th.Kaluza, have put forward ingeneous
ideas along with this direction; but concerning them, I am con-
vinced that they do not bring us nearer to the true solution of
the fundamental problem...”. Fruitless attempts over the years
lead to Pauli’s famous remark that one should not put together
what God had intended to be separate viz., electromagnetism
and gravitation (cf. also ref.[18]).
The basic problem is that General Relativity belongs to the
domain of classical physics whereas as Einstein observed in the
above quotation, electromagnetism belongs to the domain of ”el-
ementary electrically charged particles”, that is Quantum The-
ory, more speciﬁcally the theory of the electron. And, as J.A.

13

Wheeler[14] put it, ”the most evident shortcoming of the ge-
ometrodynamic model as it stands is this, that it fails to supply
any completely natural place for spin 1
2 in general and for the
neutrino in particular”, while ”it is impossible to accept any de-
scription of elementary particles that does not have a place for
spin half.” This apart it should be remembered that the space
time we speak of in general relativity is not only deterministic,
but we also speak in terms of deﬁnite points of space time. This
as seen above is forbidden in Quantum Theory by the Uncer-
tainity Principle. Infact four dimensional space time exists only
as a classical approximation [19, 20].
On the other hand, Quantum Gravity wherein one invokes phe-
33cms, has
nomena at the scale of the Planck length, that is 10−
not been satisfactorily concluded. The above Planck length con-
siderations as is well known and brieﬂy alluded to earlier, lead
to what have been sometimes termed as, ”maximons” particles
which are essentially Schwarzchild black holes with the Planck
5gm. Such particles are too
length radius, and with mass
∼
massive to be termed ”elementary”, are transient, with life times
42sec and moreover they do not exhibit the all important

∼
spin.
However the following question is to be clariﬁed: How can an
electron described by the Quautum Mechanical Dirac spinor be
identiﬁed with the geometrodynamic Kerr-Newman black hole
characterized by curved space time? The answer is as follows:
As we approach the Compton wavelength the ”negative energy”
two rowed component χ of the full four rowed Dirac spinor (θχ),
where θ denotes the positive energy two spinor[10], begins to
dominate. Further under reﬂections, while θ goes to θ, χ be-

10−

haves like a psuedo-spinor (cf.ref.[21]),

χ

We can easily identify N Aµ in (7) with the electromagnetic four
potential. The fact that N = 1 explains why the charge is dis-
crete.
In this formulation, electromagnetism is the result of the covari-
ant derivative that arises due to the Quantum Mechanical be-
haviour of the negative energy components within the Compton
wavelength. Thus we have endowed the electron with curvature
and have introduced the double connectivity of spin half into a
geometrodynamic formulation. This may be called a Quantum
Mechanical Black Hole (QMBH).
Equation (7) is apparently identical to Weyl’s formulation for
the uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and gravity. But there is a
ﬁne print. Weyl’s Christofell symbol contains two independent
entities - the metric tensor gµv and the electromagnetic poten-
tial φ[22]. In eﬀect there is no uniﬁcation of electromagnetism
and gravity, which prompted Einstein’s remark quoted earlier.
In our formulation this follows from the Quantum Mechanical
pseudo spinor property.
However, to complete our task we still have to show that the

15

gravitational ﬁeld and the electromagnetic ﬁeld, both emerge
from the above formulation. We will ﬁrst demonstrate the emer-
gence of the mass and the charge.
We start with the metric of a relativistic ”ﬂuid” in the linearized
theory[14] (in units G = 1, c = 1, ¯h = 1),

gµv = ηµv + hµv, hµv = Z

Finally given the mass and charge we take the following short

nary displacement (4) As is well known, in General Relativity

this leads us inexplicably and as if by accident[15, 16], from the
static Kerr-Metric to the full Kerr-Newman metric. Newman
himself observed, ”...one does not understand why it works. Af-
ter many years of study I have come to the conclusion that it
works simply by accident”.
However in the preceding setting of covariant derivatives in a
Quantum Mechanical context one can see the rationale for the
¯h
transformation (4): We take ao
2mc. In other
words we are probing the Zitterbewegung region of the Quan-
tum Mechanical Black Hole. This then leads to (7). This again
indicates how electromagnetism or the Kerr-Newman metric for
the electron emerge from the Zitterbewegung region.
In any case remembering that the Kerr-Newman ﬁeld is a sta-
tionary ﬁeld, and to this extent we are dealing with the approx-
imation of an isolated electron at rest, it can be shown shown
that the electromagnetic mass of the Kerr-Newman ﬁeld coin-
cides with the mass itself, in this theory. This was not possible
in the Classical Theory of the electron[24].
It is worth mentioning that spin can be considered to be the
angular momentum within the Zitterbewegung region[25], while
the electron (and its massless version, the neutrino) have been
considered to be the primary elementary particle[26]. Hestenes
too has argued that the inertial energy could be considered
as due to Zitterbewegung processes within the Compton wave-
length though the general relativistic scheme is absent in this
case. Finally the emergence of the inertial mass from within the
Compton wavelength can be demonstrated without recourse to
General Relativity[9, 27].
In an early paper attempting to describe elementary particles
within the framework of the gravitational ﬁeld equations specif-

19

ically, the Schwarzchild and Kerr solutions,[28], Einstein and
Rosen wondered to what extent Quantum Mechanics had been
included in their scheme. After that, much work has been done
in attempts to unify General Relativity and Quantum Theory,
notwithstanding the diﬃculties mentioned in earlier.
However the fact remains that not only are Planck scale parti-
5gms too massive to be elementary,
cles with mass of about 10−
but as pointed out earlier, they do not exhibit the all important
spin half: they are essentially Schwarzchild Black Holes. On the
other hand spinorial behaviour is a very Quantum Mechanical
characteristic - it is fermions that represent the material content
of the universe.
Neutrinos are also described by the above model. In this case
as pointed out[9], because they have vanishingly small mass,
they have a very large Compton wavelength so that at our usual
spatial scales we encounter predominantly the negative energy
components with the peculiar handedness (cf.ref.[9] for details).
It was shown in ref.[9] that if on the other hand instead of con-
sidering distances >> the electron Compton wavelength we con-
sider the distances of the order of the Compton wavelength itself
(8) leads to a QCD type potential,

The above considerations immediately lead us to consider the
possibility of describing weak interactions on the one hand and
quarks on the other in the above model.
We will now indicate how it is possible to do so [29, 30].

20

3 and 2

Let us start with the electrostatic potential given in equations
(7) and (11).
We will ﬁrst show how the characteristic and puzzling 1
charges of the quarks emerge.
For this we ﬁrst note that the electron’s spin half which is cor-
rectly described in the above model of the Kerr-Newman Black
Hole, outside the Compton wavelength automatically implies
three spatial dimensions[14]. This is no longer true as we ap-
proach the Compton wavelength in which case we deal with low
space dimensionality. So for the Kerr-Newman Fermions spa-
tially conﬁned to distances of the order of their Compton wave-
length or less, we consider two and one spatial dimensionality.
Using now the well known fact[9] that each of the Tıj in is given
by 1
3ǫ, ǫ being the energy density, it follows from (11) that the
3e or 1
particle would have the charge 2
3e, as in the case of quarks.
Moreover, as noted earlier (cf.ref.[8, 9] also), because we are at
the Compton wavelength scale, we encounter predominantly the
components χ of the Dirac wave function, with opposite parity.
So, as with neutrinos, this would mean that the quarks would
display helicity, which indeed is true: As is well known, in the
V
A theory, the neutrinos and relativistic quarks are left-
handed while the corresponding anti-particles are right handed
(brought out by the small Cabibo angle). This also automati-
cally implies that these fractionally charged particles cannot be
observed individually because they are by their very nature spa-
tially conﬁned. This is also expressed by the conﬁning part of
the QCD potential (16). We come brieﬂy to this aspect now.
Let us consider the QCD type potential (16). To facilitate com-
parison with the standard literature[5], we multiply the left hand

to natural units c = ¯h = 1 momentarily. The potential then

(cf.ref.[5]). Interestingly, as a check, one can verify that, as the

Thus both the fractional quark charges (and handedness) and
their masses are seen to arise from this formulation.
To proceed further we consider (11) (still remaining in natural
units):

Comparison with the QCD potential and (18) shows that the

If the scale is such that we do not go into fractional charges, we
get from (18), instead, the mass of the intermediary particle as
274me, which is the pion mass.
All this is ofcourse completely consistent with the physics of
strong interactions.
It has already been noted that in the formulation of leptons as
Kerr-Newman Black Holes, for Neutrinos, which have vanish-
ingly small mass, if at all, so that their Compton wavelength is
inﬁnite or very large, we encounter predominantly the negative
energy components of the Dirac spinor.
It was shown in, for
example, ref.[9], that this explains their characteristic helicity
and two component character. One should expect that from the
above considerations, we should be able to explain weak inter-
actions also.
Even in the early days leading to the electro-weak theory,[31],
it was realized, that with the weak coupling constant set equal
to the electromagnetic coupling constant and with a massive in-

now that (19) is consistent with (15). However, it should be
borne in mind that now (15) is not an adhoc experimental result,

Our starting point is equation (15), which we rewrite, as

3 Discussion

The model of leptons as Kerr-Newman Black Holes, as discussed
above leads to a cosmology[8, 32] in which the universe continues
to expand and accelerate with ever decreasing density.
Inter-
estingly this has been conﬁrmed by several independent recent
observations[33].
On the other hand the model also predicts that near Comp-
ton wavelength scales electrons would display a neutrino type
bosonization or low dimensionality[34]. This type of behaviour
has been noticed, already at nano scales in recent experiments
with nano tubes [35, 36].
What we have shown above is that the Kerr-Newman Black Hole
description of the electron leads to a uniﬁcation of gravitation
and electromagnetism as expressed by e.g. (15). It also gives
a clue to the peculiar fractional charges and also masses of the
quarks and the QCD interaction. Finally the model explains
the handedness of the neutrino and gives a clue to the origin of
weak interactions.
So at the heart of the matter is the description of the electron as
a Kerr-Newman Black Hole, valid at length scales greater than
the Compton wavelength. The other phenomena appear from
here at diﬀerent length (or energy) scales.

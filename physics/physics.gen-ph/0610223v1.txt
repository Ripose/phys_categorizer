In large networks of Dirac spinors individual spinors show space-time properties relative to
quasi-classical clusters of spinors. Three forms of relations between spinors and such clusters are
identiﬁed. These constitute three families of particle-like conﬁgurations, with a mass spectrum in
close agreement with the experimental lepton spectrum.

I. INTRODUCTION

In 1971 R. Penrose [1] made an attempt to describe the geometry of space-time in a purely com-
binatorial way. Penrose studied networks of two-component spinors, which represented the simplest
quantum mechanical objects. He was able to show that large clusters of such spinors, generated prop-
erties of angular direction in three-dimensional space. Despite this success, the concept of SU(2)
based spin networks was not considered rich enough to also describe distance [2]. Penrose’s interest,
therefore, turned to more complex twistor objects. Nowadays various kinds of spin networks are
discussed as models of space-time at Planck scales [3].

This article is based on Dirac spinors. Dirac spinors are understood as four-component spinors.
They transform under the operations of the homogeneous Lorentz group by the application of 4 ×
4-matrices, which are generated from well-known Dirac matrices. They do not have space-time
properties, nor do they carry energy-momentum in the usual sense. Two Dirac spinors can be
distinguished only by their spin. Two spinors in the same spin state are indistinguishable.

A network of Dirac spinors is a set of Dirac spinors, and an instruction of how to link together
spinors, to form clusters with well-deﬁned quantum numbers. The linking of spinors can rapidly lead
to complex structures. This article, therefore, analyses some structures of physical interest within
very large networks of Dirac spinors. In doing so it takes advantage of laws of large numbers and of
symmetry rules.

An elementary rule of quantum mechanics will be used to identify substructures within Dirac spin
networks: If a state is a product of two states, corresponding to two subsets of spinors, then the
two structures are separable, and can, therefore, be treated as independent quantum mechanical
systems. Otherwise the states are entangled, and the structure has to be treated as a coherent
quantum mechanical system.

II. DIRAC SPINORS AND DE SITTER GROUP

Dirac spinors form a complex linear vector space, which can easily be extended to a Hilbert space

H by adding the scalar product

which is well-known from Dirac’s theory of electrons.

Dirac’s γ-matrices generate symmetry transformations in H. They satisfy the anti-commutation

relations

and the commutation relations

where µ, ν = 0, . . . , 3.

form an irreducible representation of the de Sitter group SO(3,2) on the Hilbert space of Dirac
spinors. The proof of this is by inserting (6) into the commutation relation of SO(3,2)

[sµν, sρσ] = −i[gµρsνσ − gµσsνρ + gνσsµρ − gνρsµσ] ,

[sµ4, sν4] = −isµν ,

[sµν, sρ4] = i[gνρsµ4 − gµρsν4] .

The Hilbert space H of Dirac spinors, equipped with symmetry transformations generated by the

4 × 4-matrices (6), will be the basis for this article.

A system of N Dirac spinors is then described by states in a product Hilbert space H ∗ ... ∗ H.
By reducing product representations with respect to SO(3,2), new representations are obtained with
diﬀerent spin quantum numbers. This process links spinor states to form product states with deﬁned
quantum numbers. This process is well-known from quantum mechanics of angular momentum.
Within this article a set of N Dirac spinors, described by means of a Hilbert space H ∗ ... ∗ H, and
equipped with this linkage will be called a Dirac spin network.

III. POINCAR´E GROUP AND SPACE-TIME

Consider a large number of, say N = 1023, Dirac spinors, forming product states with large quasi-
continuous total quantum numbers. Such a cluster will be called a macro-object or simply object and
its state a macro-state for short.

The generators Sab of SO(3,2)-transformations of the macro-objects are deﬁned by the sum over

the corresponding operators sab of the individual spinors.

In the following, the transformations generated by Sµ4 will be restricted to inﬁnitesimal small

transformations. This can be expressed by replacing Sµ4 by operators Pµ, deﬁned by

with a (dimensionless) number R, inserting (10) into (8), dividing both sides by R2 and, ﬁnally,
taking the limit R → ∞. Then the commutator (8) is replaced by

Sµ4 = R Pµ

[Pµ, Pν] = 0 .

(10)

(11)

This limit is known as contraction limit or group contraction [4].

If R is large but ﬁxed, (11) will not be completely satisﬁed, but can nevertheless serve as an
approximation to (8). In this sense the contraction limit is often used in physical problems. In this
way it will be used in the following.

The commutation relations (7), reformulated for Sµν,

[Sµν, Sρσ] = −i[gµρSνσ − gµσSνρ + gνσSµρ − gνρSµσ] ,

(12)

deﬁne the homogeneous Lorentz group SO(3,1) as a subgroup of SO(3,2). They are not changed by
the contraction process. From (9) the commutation relations of Pµ with the generators of Lorentz
transformations are obtained

[Sµν, Pρ] = i[gνρPµ − gµρPν] .

(13)

(11), (12) and (13) are the commutation relations of the Poincar´e group P(3,1). The quasi-continuous
quantum numbers of SO(3,2) are now replaced by the continuous spectrum of Pµ.

The contraction limit delivers an approximate description of the symmetry group SO(3,2) by the
Poincar´e group, which is valid for inﬁnitesimal operations generated by Sµ4. Because of the rescaling,
these correspond to ﬁnite transformations generated by Pµ.

Eigenstates |P i of Pµ have to be considered as approximations to the states of clusters of Dirac
spinors. More accurately, they serve as approximations within an inﬁnitesimal small neighbourhood
N of an arbitrarily chosen origin P, with respect to transformations generated by Sµ4.

These eigenstates can be used to construct new states |Xi that are localised in space-like directions

|Xi := (2π)−3/2

d3P eixµPµ |P i .

(14)

When applied to these states, Pµ generate translations by 4-vectors aµ

∞

Z
−∞

3

eiaµPµ |Xi = |X + ai .

(15)

The 4-vectors aµ span a 4-dimensional real vector space with Minkowskian metric, which, with
respect to P(3,1), has the transformation properties of space-time.

Obviously, space-time is obtained as a property of macro-states. Therefore, in the absence of

macro-objects, space-time is not deﬁned.

of momentum and position.

The quantum mechanical consequences of deﬁnition (14) are the well-known commutation relations

In terms of eigenstates of Pµ, the spin network can now be described in the following way. There
are states of representations of the Poincar´e group P(3,1), which can be linked to form common
states of new representations of P(3,1). In this way a network of momentum states is formed, which
spreads out over the 4-momentum space. Momentum space is obtained as a space of possible values of
quantum numbers that label eigenvectors of Pµ. Through the coverage by a network of momentum
states it materialises as a physical entity. A similar consideration applies to the complementary
picture deﬁned by localised states (14).

Two macro-states can be entangled to form a product state with momentum P

|P i =

Z

d3q c(q) |P1 − qi |P2 + qi .

(16)

The two macro-objects are then linked by the “exchange”’ of three components of momentum q.
They form a coherent system, because their state cannot be written as a product of two states.

Obviously, a macro-object can be entangled also with two or even three other objects as indicated

|P i =

dq1dq2dq3 c(q) |P1 − (q1, q2, q3)i |P2 + (q1, 0, q3)i |P3 + (0, q2, 0)i

and

|P i =

(18)

Z

In all cases the three components of momentum act like chemical valences, allowing the ﬁrst

subsystem to link to a maximum of three other subsystems.

Entanglement of states is a typical quantum mechanical phenomenon, with impressive applications
in quantum computing, encryption and even “teleportation” [5]. Below it will be shown that the type
of entanglement, as deﬁned by (16), (17) or (18), signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the formation of particles
in space-time.

IV. PARTICLES IN SPACE-TIME

Consider a macro-object of N Dirac spinors with total momentum P . Then add another spinor,
described by a 4-component vector ψs to the system. Within the Poincar´e approximation the com-
bined state describes a macro-object of N + 1 spinors with a slightly diﬀerent momentum P + p.
Therefore, relative to the macro-object the spinor has a momentum p.

4

Now apply a Lorentz transformation to the combined system. Then both momenta P and p
transform as 4-vectors, whereas ψs transforms as a Dirac spinor. From the Dirac theory of electrons
it is known that under such a transformation the product γµpµ is invariant.

A numerical value can easily be assigned to this invariant. The energy operator of the combined
system is deﬁned as the approximation to the operator L04 + 1
2γ0. With a spinor state ψ = (1, 0, 0, 0)
and γ0 = diag(1, 1, −1, −1), the value 1
2 is obtained as the contribution of the spinor to the energy
of the macro-object, in units of SO(3,2) quantum numbers. Hence, the state ψ of a Dirac spinor and
its contribution p to the momentum of a macro-object must obey the Dirac equation

(γµpµ − m)|ψsi = 0 ,

(19)

with mass m = 1

2, if p is measured in the same units as m.

The mass m is dimensionless. It is deﬁned in “units of quantum numbers”. Values in units of a
mass will be obtained, when a “standard” i.e. the mass of a special particle is determined, to which
all further measurements of masses are refered. Obviously, a candidate for such a reference has just
been found.

Since the value of the momentum p and the associated spinor state ψs do not depend on any
speciﬁc property of the macro-object, it makes sense to label the spinor state with this value of
p and write ψs(p). This is more than a formal act. Since these spinor states, when attached to
macro-states, add the momentum p to the macro-object, it can be said that, in the environment of
macro-objects, these spinor states “carry” a momentum of p. Recoupling a spinor state from one
macro-object to another, therefore, describes the transport of 4-momentum.

The new degrees-of-freedom, expressed by the momentum p, of course, do not belong to the
spinor itself. Nor do they stand for degrees-of-freedom within the linking of the spinor to the
macro-object. What they express, are degrees-of-freedom in the linkage of the macro-object to
the observing system. This is evident from the way the spectrum of p has been generated by
applying a Lorentz transformation to the combined system of spinor and macro-object. Alternatively,
the Lorentz transformation could have been applied to the observing system. Generally spoken:
the momentum degrees-of-freedom describe the degrees-of-freedom in embedding the spinor into
a network of macroscopic clusters of spinors. A descriptive way of looking at p is, obviously, to
understand it as an orbital momentum relative to the observing system.

The way space-time properties of a Dirac spinor have been introduced may appear rather coarse.
However, as long as the approximate Poincar´e invariance is valid, this, at least, delivers an adequate
description of such processes that are determined by the exchange of energy-momentum between a
single Dirac spinor and macro-objects. In other words, a description of “free” particles has been
obtained. Of course, this model is not adequate for the description of, i.e. two “interacting” parti-
cles without the inclusion of suitable “higher order corrections”. Steps in this direction have been
described in [6,7].

What can be said about the statistics of these particles? By deﬁnition, spinors cannot be distin-
guished except by the spin variable. Therefore, when two spinors are interchanged, their common
state does not change, except for a phase factor. The interchange of spinors in space-time can be

5

performed by a rotation of 180 degrees with respect to a symmetry axis of the system. A simple
calculation delivers a phase factor i for each spinor. Then the total state is changed by a factor of
−1. Therefore, the particles are subjected to Fermi statistics. This derivation of Pauli’s principle
goes back to A. A. Broyles [8] in 1976. Later it was used, obviously independently, by Feynman and
Weinberg [9].

Summarising it can be stated that spinors, when described in relation to macro-objects, show

properties of spin-1/2 fermions in space-time.

V. MASS SPECTRUM

In the last section, a mass-scale was found, which will now be used to determine mass relations

with more complex conﬁgurations.

Assume that the observing system is linked by forms (17) or (18) to two or three macro-objects,
respectively, with an additional spinor linked to this aggregate of macro-objects. In order to compare
the multi-object conﬁgurations to the single object situation treated obove, they must be reduced
to, eventually a direct sum of, representations of the Poincar´e group. Then in each representation,
a partial mass will be found with the same value of 1/2. The eﬀective mass is then determined
by evaluating the sum of representations within the direct sum. Although each representation
may contribute a diﬀerent momentum, the number of representations should not depend on the
momenta involved. Therefore, the determination of the eﬀective mass, primarily means ﬁnding all
representations of P(3,1) that contribute to the multi-object situation. To this aim, ﬁrst a SO(3,2)
representation will be decomposed into a set of SO(3,1) representations.

Let S denote the group of all SO(3,2) transformations. Let L denote the group of Lorentz trans-
formations of SO(3,2), which forms a subgroup of S, and let P denote the transformations of the
(approximate) Poincar´e group P(3,1).

Consider a macro-object with state |Φi in a SO(3,2)-symmetric Hilbert space HS. Assume that
in the neighbourhood N of the origin P this state is approximated by a momentum eigenstate.
When all Lorentz transformations L are applied to this state, a Hilbert space HL, “local” to N , as
a subspace of HS, is obtained.

If a (ﬁnite) transformation s ∈ S, s 6∈ L is applied to a state of HL, a new state is generated, which
is not in HL. Therefore, by applying transformations of the coset Ls, a non-equivalent Hilbert space
H s
L, local to sN , is obtained. There is a one-to-one relation between cosets Ls and Hilbert spaces
H s
L. The set of all cosets Ls generates the total Hilbert space HS.
The set of cosets forms a homogeneous space S/L, where S acts transitive on this space and L is
the isotropy group of the origin P; the projection π : S → S/L makes S a principle bundle on S/L
with ﬁber L [10].

Adding up all the non-equivalent H s

L means an integration over the homogeneous space S/L. The

integral delivers a decomposition of HS in terms of H s

Integrating a constant C over S/L results in the product of C with the volume V of S/L

(22)

Volumes of homogeneous spaces were systematically calculated by L. K. Hua [12,13]. They have

been used with some success in semi-empirical mass formula for more than three decades [14,15].

Recently G. Gonz´alez-Mart´in [11,16] (G-M in the following) has obtained mass relations, based
on an universal structure group SL(4,R). G-M’s idea is that the structure group describes a “sub-
strate”, from which particles are generated as “excitations” with certain symmetric and topological
properties, which are associated with subgroups of the structure group.

G-M has found a mass formula for the three massive leptons

mn = 4π

n = 1, 2 ,

(23)

16π

n

(cid:18)

where me is the electron mass and m1 stands for the myon mass, m2 to the tauon mass. With the
experimental electron mass of 0.5109989 MeV, G-M obtains mµ = 107, 5916 MeV and mτ = 1770, 3
MeV. (The experimental values are 105, 658 and 1776, 99.)

It will be shown that the decomposition (20) of HS leads directly to an identical mass formula.

The proof is as follows.

In the case of two or three macro-objects, the Hilbert space HS is obtained from the direct product
of individual Hilbert spaces H (1)
S . With the decomposition (20) of each
Hilbert space, the integrals contain products of volume factors (Jacobians) V (S/L). The following
factors correspond to one, two and three macro-objects, respectively,

S , and eventually H (3)

(24)

Since the eﬀective spinor mass is determined relative to macro-states in N , only the Hilbert space
HL, local to N , will contribute. Therefore, when HS is decomposed into local Hilbert spaces H s
L,
all H s
L with s 6∈ L can be dropped. This step eliminates one integration over S/L and, therefore,
divides the Jacobians in (24) by a factor of V (S/L).

Next remember that spinors are attached to macro-states of representations of P(3,1), rather than
of SO(3,1). Representations of P(3,1) are obtained from representations of SO(3,1) by applying
inﬁnitesimal transformations t ∈ S. By adding transformations t to L, again cosets Lt can be
deﬁned, forming a homogeneous space P/L with a volume [16]

V (P/L) = V (U(1)) = 4π .

(25)

7

In multi-object cases, this adds an integration over the homogeneous space P/L with a Jacobian of
V (P/L).

A scaling factor, including both steps, is then given by

V (P/L)
V (S/L)

= 4π

= 3/4 .

3
16π

(26)

(27)

(28)

In the one-object case, a modiﬁcation of this factor is required. Here, inﬁnitesimal t applied to HL
are approximated by translations. These do not aﬀect momentum eigenstates, except by a phase
factor. This means, the addition of a translation t to L generates a Hilbert space H t
L that is identical
to HL. Therefore, in the one-object case, V (P/L) has to be replaced by 1. Instead of (26), the scaling
factor

1
V (S/L)

=

16π

must be used.

In multi-object cases, an inﬁnitesimal t, applied to an individual H (i)s

L , generates a mixture of
translations, rotations and boost operations in H (i)s
L . This is a consequence of the commutation
relations between the generators of t and (ﬁnite!) transformations s. Such changes of the individual
states, in general, cannot be reduced to translations in H (i)
L . Therefore, in these cases the factor (26)
does apply.

Multiplying the terms in (24) by the appropriate factors (27) and (26), results in the following

volume factors

1 , 4π

and 4π

16π

.

This means, in N the entanglement of two and three macro-states generate a direct sum of non-
equivalent Hilbert spaces HP , with a multiplicity determined by an integral over a parameter space
with a Jacobian given by (28).

The spinor, linked to a multi-object conﬁguration, is linked to every momentum eigenstate in each
Hilbert space HP . It delivers a contribution to the mass of me = 1/2 in each HP . The total eﬀective
spinor mass is then determined by an integral over a volume corresponding to one of the volume
factors of (28). But since the spinor mass is the same in each HP , the integral can be replaced by a
multiplication of me by the volume factors of (28). This reproduces G-M’s mass relations (23).

The mathematical steps performed before can be illustrated in the following way: Starting from a
neighbourhood N of point P, a macro-state is selected and Lorentz transformations in N are applied
to this state. This generates a Hilbert space HL. In N the states of HL are locally approximated
by momentum eigenstates in the tangential plane at P. A transformation s generates a new Hilbert
space H s
L. In sN its states can again be approximated by momentum eigenstates in the tangential
plane of sP. In this way a coverage of HS by a set of H s
L is obtained. The coverage allows for a
piecewise approximation of any state of HS by (linear combinations of) momentum eigenstates in
neighbourhoods sN of sP. Any state is thereby decomposed into a direct sum of “local” states in
H s
L. By forming a direct product of two such states, each local state of one object is multiplied

8

by each local state of the other. Then all product states are collected into matching tangential
planes. Finally, a spinor is linked to the resulting momentum eigenstates in the tangential plane at
P. The multiplicity of these momentum eigenstates is given by factors of (28), which result from
the piecewise decomposition (20).

The fact that the mass relations agree with experimental data suggests an identiﬁcation of the
three conﬁgurations with a representation of massive leptons. The actual existance of the lepton
mass spectrum then delivers strong experimental support for the concept of a spin network with a
basic SO(3,2) symmetry, as presented here.

The preceding statements, in principle, apply also to the massless solutions of the Dirac equation.
Therefore, each massive lepton is accompanied by a massless, neutrino-like lepton. Hence, the three
types of linkage between macro-objects, which are provided by the three components of momentum,
generate three families of leptons.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this article a rudimental quantum mechanical theory of space-time has been presented.
Minkowskian space-time has been obtained in a rather unspectacular way, as a ﬂat-space approxima-
tion for quasi-classical clusters of Dirac spinors. This approximation is valid for the neighbourhood
of any given point in space-time. It is evident from the structure of the basic symmetry group that
for larger translations, both in space and time, the ﬂat-space approximation will no longer be valid.
This means, higher approximations will result in a curved space-time structure. But even then,
space-time will very likely have to be derived as a property of quasi-classical clusters of spinors.
This will be the subject of further investigations.

In a quantum theory of space-time, one may expect to ﬁnd a quantised analogue of the classical
space-time structure. The network of Dirac spinors seems to serve this purpose, though not in
space-time, but in the complementary space of 4-momentum. However, there is no ﬁne-structure
of space-time itself, as might have been expected, for example some kind of “quantum foams” or
indications of “quantum loops”. The reason is quite simple: space-time has been derived as a
property of quasi-classical structures, and not as an independent physical entity. It is a space made
up by the values of parameters, which describe ﬁnite transformations of a symmetry group, applied
to states with quasi-continuous quantum numbers. Obviously, it does not make sense to ask for any
underlying ﬁne-structure of plain parameters. Of course, the spinor elements, which make up the
quasi-classical structures, form a ﬁne-structure. But this certainly does not imply any ﬁne-structure
of space-time itself, but rather of the matter that is embedded in space-time. In this sense, individual
spinors are manifestations of “internal quantum numbers”, whereas large clusters of spinors develop
space-time as a collective property.

For more than three decades, spin networks have been considered a promising basis for a fun-
damental theory of space-time. Unfortunately, such a theory has been sought for at scales of the
Planck length. This has made it virtually impossible to obtain any seminal support from exper-
imental observations. The approach, presented in this article, has introduced a spin network at

9

the sub-atomic level, with the clear advantage that its results can directly be compared with the
experiments of particle physics. In this sense, the actual observation of the lepton mass spectrum,
delivers experimental evidence in favour of the approach and its interpretation presented here.

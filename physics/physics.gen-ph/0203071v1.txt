ABSTRACT

The Deutsch multiverse is collection of parallel universes.
In this article a formal theory and a topos-theoretic model
of the Deutsch multiverse are given. For this the Lawvere-
Kock Synthetic Diﬀerential Geometry and topos models
for smooth inﬁnitesimal analysis are used. Physical prop-
erties of multi-variant and many-dimensional parallel uni-
verses are discussed. Quantum ﬂuctuations of universe
geometry are considered. Photon ghosts in parallel uni-
verses are found.

This paper was published in Russian journal ”Mathematical Structures and
Modeling”, No.8, 76-90 (2001) (ftp://cmm.univer.omsk.su/pub/sbornik8/guts.zip).

Introduction

In David Deutsch ’s book [1] the sketch of structure of physical reality named
Multiverse which is set of the parallel universes is given. Correct description of
the Multiverse (as Deutsch considers) can be done only within the framework
of the quantum theory.

In this article a formal theory and a topos-theoretic model of the Deutsch

multiverse are given.

We wish to preserve the framework of the mathematical apparatus of the
4-dimensional General theory of the relativity, and so we shall consider the
Universe as concrete 4-dimensional Lorentz manifold < R(4), g(4) > (named
space-time).

Our purpose is to give an opportunity to take into account presence par-
allel universes, i.e. other universes being most various 4-dimensional pseudo-
Riemannian manifolds which are belonged to special hyperspace of any dimen-
sion.

Moreover, hyperspaces should be as is wished much; the geometry, topol-
ogy, dimension of hyperspaces should be as much as various that always it
was possible to ﬁnd uncountable number of the universes as much as simi-
lar to ours, and simultaneously should exist as is wished a lot of installed,
completely unlike the world in which we live.

The structure of a physical reality should take into account whim of a
conceiving essence to see it in every possible conceivable forms, having thus
rather poor research toolkit which basis should be the theory of a relativity
and the quantum mechanics.

We are not going to pass to many-dimensional theories such as Kaluza-
Klein theory. No. We emphasize that a basis of the Multiverse theory should
be the 4-dimensional metric g(4).

1 Formal theory of Multiverse

We create the theory of Multiverse as formal theory T which is maximally
similar to the General theory of Relativity, i.e. as theory of one 4-dimensional
universe, but other parallel universes must appear under costruction of models
of formal theory.

The basis of our formal theory T is the Kock-Lawvere Synthetic Diﬀerential

Geometry (SDG) [2].

SDG has not any set-theoretic model because Kock-Lawvere axiom is in-
compatible with Law of excluded middle. Hence we shall construct formal

2

theory of Multiverse with intuitionistic logic. Models for this theory are topos-
theoretic models.

In SDG the commutative ring R is used instead of real ﬁeld IR. The ring

R must satisfy the following axioms 1:

(A1) < R, +, ·, 0, 1 > is commutative ring.

(A2) R is local ring, i.e.

0 = 1 =⇒ ⊥
∃y (x · y = 1)∃y (1 − x) · y = 1.

(A3) < R, < > is real Euclidean ordered local ring, i.e. < is transitive relation such

that

(a) 0 < 1, (0 < x & 0 < y =⇒ 0 < x + y & 0 < x · y),
(b) ∃y(x · y = 1) ⇐⇒ (0 < x ∨ x < 0),
(c) 0 < x =⇒ ∃y(x = y2) (Euclidean property).

(A4) ≤ is a preorder, i.e. reﬂexive and transitive relation, and

(a) 0 ≤ 1, (0 ≤ x & 0 ≤ y =⇒ 0 ≤ x + y & 0 ≤ x · y), 0 ≤ x2,
(b) (x is nilpotent, i.e. xn = 0) =⇒ 0 ≤ x.

(A5) < and ≤ are compactible in the following sence:

(a) x < y =⇒ x ≤ y,
(b) x < y & y ≤ x =⇒ ⊥.

(A6) (Kock-Lawvere axiom). Let D = {x ∈ R : x2 = 0}. Then

∀(f ∈ RD)∃!(a, b) ∈ R × R ∀d ∈ D(f (d) = a + b · d).

(A7) (Integration axiom).

∀f ∈ R[0.1]∃!g ∈ R[0.1](g(0) = 0 & ∀x ∈ [0, 1] (g′(x) = f (x)),

where [0, 1] = {x ∈ R : 0 ≤ x & x ≤ 1} and g′(x) is the only b such that
∀d ∈ D(g(x + d) = g(x) + b · d).

We use the symbolic record:

Ring R includes real numbers from IR and has new elements named in-

ﬁnitesimals belonging to ”sets”

∆∆ = {x ∈ R : f (x) = 0, all f ∈ mg

0},

{0} is ideal of functions having zero germ at 0, i.e. vanishing in a

where mg
neighbourhood of 0.

We have

D ⊂ D2 ⊂ ... ⊂ Dk ⊂ ... ⊂ ∆∆.

For given system of axioms we can construct [4, 3] Riemmanian geometry
for four-dimensional (formal) manifolds < R4, g(4) >. These manifolds are
basis for the Einstein theory of gravitation.

We postulate that multiverse is four-dimensional space-time in SDG, i.e.
is a formal Lorentz manifold < R4, g(4) > for which the Einstein ﬁeld equations
are held:

A solution of these equations is 4-metric g(4).
Below we consider the physical consequences of our theory in so called
which contain as full subcategory the

well-adapted models of the form SetILop
category of smooth manifolds M.

2 Smooth topos models of multiverse

Let IL be dual category for category of ﬁnitely generated C ∞-rings. It is called
category of loci [7]. The objects of IL are ﬁnitely generated C ∞-rings, and
morphisms are reversed morphisms of category of ﬁnitely generated C ∞-rings.
The object (locus) of IL is denoted as ℓA, where A is a C ∞-ring. Hence,

IL-morphism ℓA → ℓB is C ∞-homomorphism B → A.

A ﬁnitely generated C ∞-ring ℓA is isomorphic to ring of the form C ∞(IRn)/I

(for some natural number n and some ﬁnitely generated function ideal I).

Category SetILop

is topos. We consider topos SetILop
as model of formal
theory of multiverse. Only some from axioms (A1)-(A12) are true in topos
model SetILop 2.

With the Deutsch point of view the transition to concrete model of formal
theory is creation of virtual reality 3. Physical Reality that we perceive was
called by Deutsch Multiverse 4. Physical Reality is also virtual reality which
was created our brain [1, p.140].

A model of multiverse is generator of virtual reality which has some reper-
toire of environments. Generator of virtual reality creates environments and
we observe them. Explain it.

Under interpretation i : SetILop

|= T of formal multiverse theory T in
topos SetILop
the objects of theory, for example, ring R, power RR and so on
are interpreted as objects of topos, i.e. functors F = i(R), F F = i(RR) and so
on. Maps, for example, R → R, R → RR are now morphisms of topos SetILop
,
i.e. natural transformations of functors: F → F , F → F F .

Finelly, under interpretation of language of formal multiverse theory we
must interpret elements of ring R as ”elements” of functors F ∈ SetILop
. In
other words we must give interpretation for relation r ∈ R. It is very diﬃcult

2 One can take as models topoi F , G Z and others [7, Appendix 2]. All axioms (A1)-(A12)

are true for these topoi (see [7, p.300])

task because functor F is deﬁned on category of loci IL; its independent variable
is arbitrary locus ℓA, and dependent variable is a set F (ℓA) ∈ Set. To solve
this problem we consider generalized elements x ∈ℓA F of functor F .

Generalized element x ∈ℓA F , or element x of functor F at stage ℓA, is

called element x ∈ F (ℓA).

Now we element r ∈ R interpret as generalized element i(r) ∈ℓA F . We
have such elements so much how much loci. Transition to model SetILop
causes
”reproduction” of element r. It begins to exist in inﬁnite number of variants
{i(r) : i(r) ∈ℓA F, ℓA ∈ IL}.

Note that since 4-metric g(4) is element of object RR4×R4 then ”intuitionis-
tic” 4-metric begins to exist in inﬁnite number of variants i(g)(4) ∈ℓA i(RR4×R4).
Denote such variant as i(g)(4)(ℓA).

For simpliﬁcation of interpretation we shall operate with objects of models

. In other words, we shall write g(4)(ℓA) instead of i(g)(4)(ℓA).

Every variant g(4)(ℓA) of 4-metric g(4) satisﬁes to ”own” Einstein equa-

Assume that ring R is interpreted as functor y(ℓC ∞(IR)), i.e. i(R) = y(ℓC ∞(IR)).
Write ℓA instead of y(ℓA) and omit symbol i. Then we have

R(−) = ℓC ∞(IR)(−) = HomIL(−, ℓC ∞(IR)).

Similarly

RR4×R4

(ℓA) = HomIL(ℓA, RR4×R4

) = HomIL(ℓA × (R4 × R4), R) =

= HomIL(ℓC ∞(IRm)/I × ℓC ∞(IR4) × ℓC ∞(IR4), ℓC ∞(IR)) =
= HomILop(ℓC ∞(IR), C ∞(IRm)/I ⊗∞ C ∞(IR4) ⊗∞ C ∞(IR4)) =
= HomILop(C ∞(IR), C ∞(IRm+8)/(I, {0})) =
= HomIL(ℓC ∞(IRm+8)/(I, {0}), ℓC ∞(IR)),
where ℓA = ℓC ∞(IRm)/I, ⊗∞ is symbol of coproduction of C ∞-rings and under
calculation the folowing formulas are used:

C ∞(IRn) ⊗∞ C ∞(IRk) = C ∞(IRn+k),

ℓA → ℓC ℓB
ℓB × ℓA → ℓC

.

It follows from this that when ℓA = ℓC ∞(IRm) then

g(4)(ℓA) = [g ∈ℓA RR4×R4

] ≡ g(4)

ik (x0, ..., x3, a)dxidxk, a = (a1, ..., am) ∈ IRm.

(3)

We get (4 + m)-dimensional geometry.

Symbolically procedure of creation of many-dimensional variants of geom-
etry by means of intuitionistic 4-geometry g(4) one can represent in the form
of formal sum

Because number of stages is inﬁnite, we must write integral instead of sum:

g(4) =

D[ℓA]c(ℓA)[g(4) ∈ℓC∞(IRn−4) RR4×R4

].

Use denotations of quantum mechanics 5:

g(4) → |g(4)i,

[g(4) ∈ℓC∞(IRn−4) RR4×R4

Then (4) is rewrited in the form

|g(4)i =

D[ℓA]c(ℓA)|g(4)(ℓA)i.

Consequently, formal the Kock-Lawvere 4-geometry < R4, g(4) > is inﬁnite
sum of of classical many-dimensional pseudo-Riemmanian geometries which
contain foliation of 4-dimensional parallel universes (leaves) (under ﬁxing a =
const). Geometrical properties of these universes as it was shown in [9, 10]
to be diﬀerent even within the framework of one stage ℓA. About nature of
coeﬃcients c(ℓA) we say below in §5.

Now we recall about environments of virtual reality which must appear
under referencing to model of multiverse, in this instance, to model SetILop
.
This model is generator of virtual reality. It is not diﬃcult to understand that
generalised element |g(4)(ℓA)i is metric of concrete environment (=hyperspace
R4(ℓA)) with ”number” ℓA. In other words, study of any object of theory T
at stage ℓA is transition to one of the environments from repertoire of virtual
reality generator SetILop

.

Consider the properties of the Deutsch-G¨odel multiverse at stage ℓA =
ℓC ∞(IR)/(a4) 6, where a ∈ IR. Obviously that it is possible to take inﬁnitesimal
of form ̺(a) = a2. Multiverse at this stage is 5-dimensional hyperspace. This
hyperspace contains a foliation, leaves of which are deﬁned by the equation
a = const. The leaves are parallel universes in hyperspace (environment)
R4(ℓA) with metric g(4)(ℓA) = g(4)
ik (x, a) deﬁned formulas (6), (8). Density of
dust matter ρ = ρ0 + ̺(a) grows from classical value ρ0 ∼ 2 · 10−31 g/cm3
to +∞ under a → ±∞. Cosmological constant grows also inﬁnitely to −∞.
Hence parallel universes have diﬀerent from our Universe physical properties.
At stage ℓA = ℓC ∞(IR)/(a2) ̺(a) = a and ρ = ρ0 + ̺(a) → −∞ under
a → −∞, i.e. ρ is not phisically interpreted (we have ”exotic” matter with
negative density).

Finally, at stage 1 = ℓC ∞(IR)/(a) all ̺(a) = d(a) = λ(a) = 0, i.e. we have

classical the G¨odel universe.

4 Quantum properties of parallel

universe geometry

We apply the ideas of the Wheeler quantum geometrodynamics to our formal
theory of multiverse. So, formula for probability amplitude of transition from
3-geometry g(3) of physical 3-space to 3-geometry h(3) has the form of ”double”
Feinman integral over 4-dimensional trajectories g(4):

We see that this Feinman integral over trajectories g(4) is inﬁnite number

of integrals over (4 + m)-dimensional trajectories g(4)(ℓA) of the form (3).

We can found quantum ﬂuctuations of 4-metric g(4) → g(4) + ∆g(4) which

do not give any distortion in interference picture.

Assume that det||g(4)(ℓA)|| ∼ 1. Then we get for ﬂuctuations in (4 + m)-

izing ”size” of additional dimensions.

It follows from (9) that under L ∼ L∗, L1 ∼ T all ﬂuctuations ∆g(4)(ℓA) ∼ 1,

i.e. geometry and topology froth.

As it is shown in [13, 14] ﬂuctuations can take a place at large scale of
space and time. Here the main role belongs to additional dimensions which
are appeared under consideration of multiverse state at diﬀerent stages ℓA.

5 Electrons-twins

Deutsch has expected that parallel universe is formed from shadow elementary
particles accompanying each real particle. The real particles we can see or ﬁnd
by means of instruments, but the shadow particles are invisible. They can be
found only through their inﬂuence with real particles [1, p.48]. ”Between real
and shadow photons does not exist any diﬀerences: each photon is perceived
in one universe and is not perceived in all other parallel universes”.

The Dirac equation in SDG

Hence, spinor ghost ψ does not possess neither energy, nor momentum. So
they can not be ﬁxed any instrument. E.V. Palesheva has oﬀerred [15] to
identify the spinor ghosts with the Deutsch shadow particles.

θ(a) = 1 − ε(a) =

under ||a|| ≥ r0,
0
> 0 under ||a|| < r0.

(cid:26)

Hence at stage ℓA = ℓC ∞(IRn) ﬁeld ψ is not spinor ghost in our Universe
(a = 0) and in all universes with ||a|| < r0, but is ghost in papallel universes
for which ||a|| ≥ r0. We can take number r0 so small that universes ”labeled”
10Metric is gravitational ﬁeld deﬁning geometry and in some sense topology of space-time.
So it is naturally to identify the state (the environment) |R4(ℓA)i of multiverse at stage ℓA
(see, for instance, pic.1) with state |g(4)(ℓA)i of 4-metric g(4).

by parameter a with ||a|| < r0 must be considered as one universe due to
quantum foam of topologies and geometries (r0 is ”thickness” of universe).
This means that ﬁeld ψ is real particle in our Universe and shadow particle-
twin in all other universes.

If we take θ ∈ ∆∆ such that

θ(a) > 0 under ||a − a0|| < r0 and θ(a) = 0 under ||a|| > r0,

where a0 6= 0 and r0 < ||a0|| then ﬁeld ψ at stage ℓC ∞(IRn) is not spinor ghost
in the universe a = a0 having ”thickness” r0, and is ghost, i.e. particle-twin in
all other universes including our Universe (a = 0).

At stage 1 = ℓC ∞(IR0) = ℓC ∞(IR)/(a1) θ·f (x3+x0)mod{a1} = f (x3+x0).

It means that we have usual particle carryinging energy and momentum.

6 Photon ghosts and photons-twins

It is known that ftat monochromatic electro-magnetic wave is described by
wave equation

and has, for example, the following form

Electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengthes of wave are equal to

~E = i|~k| ~A, ~H = i[~k × ~A].

(17)

For energy-momentum tensor of wave we have

where

is energy density of wave.

d ∈ D, we can get

It follows from these formulas that under substitution ~A → d ~A, where

~E → d~E =⇒ ~E(ℓC ∞(IR)/(a2)) 6= 0 under a 6= 0.

∂ ~A

= ∆~A

~A = ~A0ei(~k~x−ωt).

T ij =

ω2 kikj,

W =

~E2
4π

But W → d2W = 0. Hence Tik ≡ 0, i.e. we have photon ghost in all universes
of multiverse. This photon ghost is electro-magnetic wave which is not carrying
neither energy, nor momentum in all universes, except universe with a = 0,
where it does not exist.

Consider now a number ϑ ∈ R. Let at stage ℓC ∞(IR)/I it is deﬁned by

class functions ϑ(a)mod I, where

ϑ(a) = e−γ|a|2

− 1, γ > 0.

(18)

We get by means of substitution ~A → ϑ~A from (17):

~E = iϑ|~k| ~A, ~H = iϑ[~k × ~A], ~A 6= 0.

Then

but

~E(ℓC ∞(IR)/(ϑ2)) 6= 0,

T ij =

W c2
ω2 kikj(ℓC ∞(IR)/(ϑ2)) mod (ϑ2) = 0.
In other words at stage (environment) ℓC ∞(IR)/(ϑ2) photons-twins which
are not carrying neither energy, nor momentum (i.e. being photon ghosts) are
observed in all universes.

7 Virtual reality as topos models of formal

multiverse

”Set of real numbers” R in SetILop
has no many accustomed properties of
real numbers from IR. Hence existence in environments of this virtual reality
generator implies unexpected or unaccustomed facts and phenomena. Some
such facts were described in giving paper.

Topos SetILop

is not unique model for formal theory T . Other models, i.e.
other virtual reality generators, will demonstrate new properties, new realities.
But it is diﬃcult to say which virtual reality is our own Physical Reality.

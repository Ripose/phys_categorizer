Abstract

We study physical situation considered by Einstein (Ann. Physik,
17, 1905) for his ﬁrst derivation of mass-energy equivalence and show
that the derivation includes hidden conditions which jeopardize cor-
rectness and completeness of Einstein’s derivation for the mass-energy
equivalence.

1 Introduction

Diﬀerent forms of mass-energy equivalence relation existed even before Ein-
stein’s ﬁrst derivation of the relation [1] and which have been reviewed along
[2]
with other developments on the relation after the year 1905 (see Ref.
and references cited therein). The focus here is on a century old Einstein’s
ﬁrst derivation which has remained persistently debatable for its correctness
and completeness [2, 3] after the emergence of Ives’ work [4] suggesting cir-
cular argument in the derivation. Here we show that Einstein’s derivation
can be considered correct and complete only when two hidden conditions, as
described later in this paper, are satisﬁed and which in contrary cannot be
satisﬁed in general. In doing so, we ﬁrst describe Einstein’s derivation brieﬂy
and then present the analysis on hidden conditions concluding Einstein’s
derivation erroneous.

2 Einstein’s Derivation

Consider a ‘stationary’ reference frame Ss and another reference frame Sv
having constant translational velocity v as measured in Ss. Consider a body
of mass Ms at rest in Ss and at some instance it emits in two opposite
directions equal quantity of light having energy L/2 where Ms and L are
measured in Ss. The conservation of energy principle for this situation in Ss
can be written as

where E0 and E1 are, respectively, total energy of the body before and after
the emission of the light as measured in Ss.

The conservation of energy principle for the body as observed from Sv

can be written as

E0 = E1 +

H0 = H1 +

L
q1 − v2/c2

where H0 and H1 are, respectively, total energy of the body before and after
the emission of the light as measured in Sv. Also c is speed of light and
v = |v|. Subtracting Eq. (1) from Eq. (2) yields

(H0 − E0) − (H1 − E1) = L[

q1 − v2/c2

− 1].

Further, by considering

Einstein obtained from Eq. (3)

H0 − E0 = K0 + C,

H1 − E1 = K1 + C,

K0 − K1 = L[

q1 − v2/c2

− 1]

where C is a constant, K0 and K1 are, respectively, kinetic energy of the
body before and after the emission of the light as measured in Sv. Einstein
then neglected fourth and higher orders terms in v in the expansion of right
hand side of Eq. (6) and simpliﬁed Eq. (6) to

and concluded “If a body gives oﬀ the energy L in the form of radiation, its
mass diminishes by L/c2”. We should mention that Stachel and Torretti [3]
showed that the approximation involved in Eq. (7) is not required to arrive
at the conclusion when exact expressions for kinetic energies K0 and K1 are
used in Eq. (6).

3 Hidden Conditions

The correctness and completeness of Einstein’s derivation depend on the va-
lidity of Eqs. (4) and (5). Now we obtain two hidden conditions in Einstein’s
derivation under the assumption that Eqs. (4) and (5) are correct. Subse-
quently we ﬁnd that one condition is invalid and another condition is not yet
proved.

Consider the body as a system in thermodynamic sense. This system is
an open system as mass/light energy cross the boundary of the system when
the mass-energy equivalence exists. The total energy of the body (system)
is summation of potential energy P , kinetic energy K and enthalpy I. We
now write total energies (E0, E1, H0 and H1) before and after the emission
in reference frames Ss and Sv in terms of enthalpy, potential and kinetic
energies.

In Ss, let Φs is potential energy per unit mass due to the potential ﬁeld
at the location of the body, we can write total energy of the body before and
after the emission as

E0 = MsΦs + MsIs,
E1 = (Ms − ms)Φs + (Ms − ms)I ′
s.

(8)
(9)

Here Ms is mass of the stationary body before the emission, ms is decrease
in mass of the body due to the emission, Is and I ′
s are enthalpy per unit mass
of the body before and after the emission, respectively, and all are measured
in Ss in which the body is stationary all the time.

As measured in Sv, we denote the mass of the moving body before the
emission by Mv, rest mass of the body before the emission when at rest in
Sv by M s
v, potential energy
per unit mass by Φv, enthalpy per unit mass of the body before and after the
emission by Iv and I ′
v respectively. With these notations we can write total

v , decrease in rest mass due to the emission by ms

energy of the body before and after the emission as measured in Sv as

H1 = K1 + (M s

H0 = K0 + M s
v − ms

v)Φv + (M s

v Φv + M s
v − ms

v Iv,
v)I ′
v.

Subracting Eq. (8) from Eq. (10) and Eq. (9) from Eq. (11), we obtain

H0 − E0 = K0 + h{M s

v Φv − MsΦs} + {M s

v Iv − MsIs}i,

(12)

and

H1 − E1 = K1 + h{(M s
v − ms

+{(M s

v − ms
v)I ′

v)Φv − (Ms − ms)Φs}

v − (Ms − ms)I ′

s}i.

If Einstein’s Eqs. (4) and (5) are valid then the terms in square brackets
in Eqs. (12) and (13) should be equal to constant C. This implies that the
following two equations

msΦs − ms
v) − Ms(Is − I ′

vΦv = 0,
vI ′
s) + ms

M s

v (Iv − I ′

v − msI ′

s = 0

v and ms = ms

should hold true which are obtained, respectively, by equating potential en-
ergy terms and enthalpy terms of Eqs. (12) and (13). As the value of rest
mass of any body is identical in Ss and Sv i.e. Ms = M s
v, Eqs.
(14) and (15) can be satisﬁed only under the conditions (1) Φs = Φv and (2)
the value of enthalpy per unit mass of any body is identical when measured in
Ss and Sv. The condition (1) does not satisfy in general e.g. our experience
on classical mechanics suggests that the measurement of potential energy
per unit mass in two inertial frames having diﬀerent elevation on the Earth
would diﬀer by some constant value other than zero. Thus the condition (1)
does not satisfy in general but satisﬁes trivially only in a particular case of
absence of potential ﬁeld i.e. Φs = Φv = 0. The second condition requires
to prove that the values of thermodynamic quantities, deﬁning the enthalpy
per unit mass of the body, are identical when measured in Ss and Sv. In
the absence of this proof and when the condition Φs = Φv is not satisﬁed in
general situation, it can be concluded that Einstein’s Eqs. (4) and (5) are
incorrect and his derivation of mass-energy equivalence is incomplete.

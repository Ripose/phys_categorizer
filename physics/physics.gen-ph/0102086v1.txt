NEW HIERARCHIC THEORY OF CONDENSED
MATTER AND ITS COMPUTERIZED
APPLICATION
TO WATER & ICE

Alex Kaivarainen

H2o@karelia.ru
URL: http://www.karelia.ru/˜alexk

This work contains review of original quantum Hierarchic theory of con-
densed matter, general for liquids and solids and its numerous branches. Com-
puter program (copyright, 1997, Kaivarainen), based on new theory, was used
for comprehensive simulations of water and ice physical properties.

Condensed matter is considered as gas of 3D standing waves (collective ex-
citations) of diﬀerent nature: thermal de Broglie waves (waves B), IR photons
and thermal phonons. Quantitative interrelation between microscopic, meso-
scopic (as intermediate) and macroscopic properties of condensed matter are
demonstrated. New theories of total internal energy, including contributions of
kinetic and potential energy, heat capacity, surface tension, vapor pressure, ther-
mal conductivity, viscosity and self-diﬀusion are described. Hierarchic theory
of osmotic pressure, based on new state equation, new theories of light refrac-
tion, Brillouin light scattering and M¨ossbauer eﬀect are presented also in article
and compared with available experimental data for water and ice. Lot of hid-
den parameters, inaccessible for experiment, describing the dynamic and spatial
properties of 24 quantum collective excitations of matter, can be calculated also,
as demonstrated on examples of water and ice.

Total number of physical parameters of liquids and solids in wide T-interval,
including that of phase transitions, to be possible to evaluate using CAMP
computer program, is about 300.

The agreement between theoretical and available experimental results is very
good. The evidence of high-T mesoscopic molecular Bose condensation (BC)
in water and ice in form of coherent clusters is obtained. The new mecha-
nisms of the 1st and 2nd order phase transitions, related to such clusters forma-
tion/melting, their assembly/disassembly and symmetry change is proposed.

Theory uniﬁes dynamics and thermodynamics on microscopic, mesoscopic
and macroscopic scales in terms of quantum physics. The idea of new optoa-
coustic device: Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP) with
huge informational possibilities, based on computer program, elaborated and
its multisided applications are described. This work may be considered as a
theoretical part of MANUEL to CAMP - program. The computer program
(CAMP) is applicable for any condensed matter, if primary four experimen-
tal parameters are known in the same T-interval. It may be ordered from the
author.

theory see at the electronic journal ”Archive of Los-Alamos”: http://arXiv.org/ﬁnd/cond-

1. INTRODUCTION

A quantum and quantitative theory of liquid state, as well as a general
theory of condensed matter, was absent till now. This fundamental problem
is crucial for diﬀerent brunches of science and technology. The existing solid
states theories did not allow to extrapolate them successfully to liquids.

Widely used molecular dynamics method is based on classical approach and
corresponding computer simulations. It cannot be considered as a general one.
The understanding of hierarchic organization of matter and developing of gen-
eral theory needs a mesoscopic bridge between microscopic and macroscopic
physics, between liquids and solids.

The biggest part of molecules of solids and liquids did not follow classical
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This means that only quantum approach is
valid for elaboration of general theory of condensed matter.

Our theoretical study of water and aqueous systems was initiated in
1986.
It was stimulated by necessity to explain the nontrivial phenomena,
obtained by diﬀerent physical methods in our investigations of water-protein
solutions. For example, the temperature anomalies in water physical proper-
ties, correlating with changes in large scale protein dynamics were found in our
group by specially elaborated experimental approaches (Kaivarainen, 1985). It
becomes evident, that the water clusters and water hierarchical cooperative
properties are dominating factors in self-organization, function and evolution
of biosystems. The living organisms are strongly dependent on water proper-
ties, representing about 70% of the body mass. On the other hand, due to
its numerous anomalies, water is an ideal system for testing a new theory of
condensed matter. If the theory works well with respect to water and ice, it is
very probable, that it is valid for other liquids, glasses or crystals as well. For
this reason we have made the quantitative veriﬁcation of our hierarchic concept
(Kaivarainen, 1989, 1992, 1995, 1996, 2000) on examples of water and ice.

Our theory considers two main types of molecular heat motion: translational
(tr) and librational (lb) anharmonic oscillations, which are characterized by cer-
tain distributions in three- dimensional (3D) impulse space. The most probable
impulse or momentum (p) determine the most probable de Broglie wave (wave
B) length (λB = h/p = vph/νB) and phase velocity (vph). Conformational in-
tramolecular dynamics is taken into account indirectly, as far it has an inﬂuence
on the intermolecular dynamics and parameters of waves B in condensed matter.
Solids and liquids are considered as a hierarchical system of collective excita-
tions - metastable quasiparticles of the four new type: eﬀectons, transitons,
convertons and deformons, strongly interrelated with each other.

When the length of standing waves B of molecules exceed the distances be-
tween them, then the coherent molecular clusters may appear as a result of high
temperature molecular Bose-condensation (BC). The possibility of BC in liquids
and solids at the ambient temperatures is one of the most important results of
our model, conﬁrmed by computer simulations. Such BC is mesoscopic one, in
contrast to macroscopic BC, responsible for superﬂuidity and superconductiv-
ity. The value of the standing wave B length, which determine the edges of the
primary eﬀecton (tr or lb) in selected directions (1,2,3) may be considered as a
mesoscopic parameter of order.

The primary transitons and convertons have common features with coherent
dissipative structures introduced by Chatzidimitrov-Dreisman and Br¨andas in

5

1988. Such structures were predicted on the background of complex scaling
method and Prigogin theory of star- unitary transformations.

Estimated from principle of uncertainty, the minimum boson’s ”degrees of

freedom”(nmin) in these spontaneous coherent structures are equal to:

nmin ≥ τ (2πkBT /h)

(1.1)

where τ is relaxation time of coherent-dissipative structures.

If, for example, τ ≃ 10−12c, corresponding to excitation of a molecular sys-
tem by infrared photon, then at T = 300K one get nmin ≃ 250.
It means
that at least 250 degrees of freedom, i.e. [250/6] molecules, able to translations
and librations act coherently and produce a photon absorption/emission phe-
nomenon. The traditional consideration of an oscillating individual molecule as
a source of photons is replaced by the notion of a correlation pattern in such a
model.

The interaction between atoms and molecules in condensed matter is much
stronger and thermal mobility/impulse much lesser, than in gas phase. It means
that the temperature of Bose condensation can be much higher in solids and
liquids than in the gas phase. The lesser is interaction between molecules
or atoms the lower temperature is necessary for initiation of Bose
condensation.

This is conﬁrmed in 1995 by Ketterle’s group in MIT and later by few
other groups, showing the Bose-Einstein condensation in gas of neutral atoms,
like sodium (MIT), rubidium (JILA) and lithium (Rice University) at very low
temperatures, less than one Kelvin. However, at this temperatures the number
of atoms in the primary eﬀectons (Bose condensate) was about 20,000 and the
dimensions were almost macroscopic: about 15 micrometers.

For comparison, the number of water molecules in primary librational eﬀec-
ton (coherent cluster), resulting from mesoscopic BC at freezing point 273 0K
is only 280 and the edge length about 20 ˚A (see Fig. 7).

Our Hierarchic theory of matter unites and extends strongly two earlier

existing most general models of solid state (Ashkroft and Mermin, 1976):

a) the Einstein model of condensed matter as a system of independent quan-

tum oscillators;

b) the Debye model, taking into account only collective phenomena - phonons

in a solid body as in continuous medium.

Among earlier models of liquid state the model of ﬂickering clusters by Frank
and Wen (1957) is closest of all to our model. In our days the quantum ﬁeld
theoretical approach to description of biosystems with some ideas, close to our
ones has been developed intensively by Umesawa’s group (Umezawa, et. al.,
1982; Umezawa, 1993) and Italian group (Del Giudice, et al., 1983; 1988, 1989).
introduced at 1998 the notion of Coherence Domains (CD),
where molecules are orchestrated by the internal electromagnetic waves (IR
photons) of matter [13]. This idea is close to our notion of collective excita-
tions of condensed matter in the volumes of 3D translational and librational IR
photons, termed primary electromagnetic deformons (see next section).

Arani et al.

The new physical ideas required a new terminology. It is a reason
why one can feel certain discomfort at the beginning of reading this work. To

6

facilitate this process, we present below a description of a new quasiparticles,
notions and terms, introduced in our Hierarchic Theory of matter (see Table
1). Most of notions and properties, presented below are not postulated, but a
results of our computer simulations.

2. THE NEW EXCITATIONS, INTRODUCED IN HIERARCHIC
THEORY OF MATTER AND THEIR PROPERTIES
The Most Probable (primary) de Broglie Wave (wave B)

The main dynamics of particles in condensed matter (liquid or solid) repre-
sents thermal anharmonic oscillations of two types: translational (tr) and libra-
tional (lb). The corresponding length of the most probable wave B of molecule
or atom of condensed matter can be estimated by two following ways:

[λ1,2,3 = h/mv1,2,3

gr = v1,2,3

ph /ν1,2,3

B ]tr,lb

(2.1)

where the most probable impulse (momentum): p1,2,3 = mv1,2,3
is equal to
product of the particle mass (m) and most probable group velocity (v1,2,3
). We
prefer to use term impulse, instead momentum, for the end not to confuse the
latter notion with momentum of impulse, deﬁned as:

gr

gr

mv1,2,3

gr λ1,2,3 = h

(2.1a)

The length of wave B could be evaluated, as the ratio of Plank constant to im-
pulse and as the ration of most probable phase velocity (v1,2,3
ph )tr,lb to most prob-
able frequency (ν1,2,3
B )tr,lb. The indices (1,2,3) correspond to selected directions
of motion in 3D space, related to the main axes of the molecules symmetry and
their tensor of polarizability. In the case when molecular motion is anisotropic
one, we have:

λ1 6= λ2 6= λ3

(2.2)

It is demonstrated in our work, using Virial theorem (see eqs. 4.10 - 4.14),
that due to anharmonicity of oscillations - the most probable kinetic energy of
molecules (Tkin)tr, lb is lesser than potential one (V )tr, lb:

(mv2/2) < (kT /2)

where most probable (mean) velocity of particle of matter is equal to corre-
sponding group velocity (v = vgr). Consequently, the most probable 3D wave
B length is big enough:

1/3

V0
N0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

< λ1,2,3 > h/(mkBT )1/2

(2.2a)

It is a condition of mesoscopic molecular Bose condensation (BC).

The Most Probable (Primary) Eﬀectons (tr and lb)

7

(2.3)

(2.4)

A new type of quasiparticles (excitations), introduced as 3D superposition of
three most probable pairs of standing waves B of molecules, are termed primary
eﬀectons. The shape of primary eﬀectons in a general case can be approximated
by parallelepiped, with the length of edges determined by 3 most probable
standing waves B. The volume of primary eﬀectons is equal to:

The number of molecules or atoms forming eﬀectons is:

Vef = (9/4π)λ1λ2λ3.

nm = (Vef )/(V0/N0),

where V0 and N0 are molar volume and Avogadro number, correspondingly.
The nm increases, when temperature is decreasing and may be about hundreds
in liquids or even thousands in solids, as shown in our work.

In liquids, primary eﬀectons may be registered as a clusters and in solids as

domains or microcrystalline.

The thermal oscillations in the volume of corresponding eﬀectons are syn-
chronized. It means the coherence of the most probable wave B of molecules
and their wave functions. We consider the primary eﬀectons as a result of
partial Bose condensation of molecules of condensed matter. Primary eﬀec-
tons correspond to the main state of Bose-condensate with the packing number
np = 0, i.e. with the resulting impulse equal to zero.

Primary eﬀectons (librational in liquids and librational and translational in
solids), as a coherent clusters, represent self-organization of condensed matter
on mesoscopic level, like I. Prigogin dissipative structures. However, revealed in
our work mesoscopic high - T Bose condensation, is a quantum phenomenon. It
is important to note, that the coherent oscillations of molecules in the volume of
the eﬀectons can not be considered as phonons (acoustic waves), because they
are not accompanied by ﬂuctuation of density in contrast to secondary deformons
(see below).

”Acoustic” (a) and ”Optical” (b) States of Primary Eﬀectons

The ”acoustic” a-state of the eﬀectons is such a dynamic state when molecules
or other particles composing the eﬀectons, oscillate in the same phase (i.e. with-
out changing the distance between them). The ”optic” b-state of the eﬀectons
is such dynamic state when particles oscillate in the counterphase manner (i.e.
with periodical change of the distance between particles). This state of primary
eﬀectons has a common features with Fr¨olich’s mode.

kin = T b

It is assumed in our model, that kinetic energies of ”acoustic” (a) and ”opti-
kin] in contrast to potential energies [V a < V b].
cal” (b) modes are equal [T a
It means that the most probable impulses in (a) and (b) states and, conse-
quently, the wave B length and spatial dimensions of the eﬀectons in the
([λ1,2,3]a = [λ1,2,3]b). The energy of intermolecular
both states are equal
interaction (Van der Waals, Coulomb, hydrogen bonds etc.) in a-state are big-
ger than that in b-state. Consequently, the molecular polarizability in a-state
also is bigger than in b-state. It means that dielectric properties of matter may
change as a result of shift of the (a ⇔ b)1,2,3

tr,lb equilibrium of the eﬀectons.

8

Primary Transitons (tr and lb)

Primary transitons represent intermediate transition states between (a) and
(b) modes of primary eﬀectons - translational and librational. Primary tran-
sitons (tr and lb) - are radiating or absorbing IR photons corresponding to
translational and librational bands in oscillatory spectra. Such quantum tran-
sitions are not accompanied by the ﬂuctuation of density but with the change
of polarizability and dipole moment of molecules only. The volumes of primary
transitons and primary eﬀectons coincides (see Table 1).

Primary Electromagnetic and Primary Acoustic Deformons (tr, lb)

Electromagnetic primary deformons are a new type of quasiparticles (excita-
tions) representing a 3D superposition of three standing electromagnetic waves.
The IR photons (tr, lb) are radiated and absorbed as a result of (a ⇔ b)1,2,3
tr,lb
transitions of primary eﬀectons, i.e. corresponding primary transitons. Elec-
tromagnetic deformons appear as a result of superposition of 3 standing IR
photons, penetrating in matter in diﬀerent selected directions (1,2,3). We as-
sume, that each of 3 pairs of counter-phase photons form a standing wave in
the volume of condensed matter.

The linear dimension of each of three edges of primary deformon is deter-
mined by the wave length of three standing IR photons, superposing in the same
space volume:

λ1,2,3 = [(n˜ν)−1]1,2,3
tr,lb

(2.5)

where: n is the refraction index and (˜ν)tr,lb - the wave number of transla-
tional or librational band. These quasiparticles as the biggest ones, are respon-
sible for the long-range (distant) space-time correlation in liquids and solids.

In the case when (b → a)tr,lb transitions of primary eﬀectons are accompa-
nied by big ﬂuctuation of density (like cavitational ﬂuctuation in liquid or defect
formation in solid), they may be followed by emission of phonons instead of pho-
tons. It happens, when primary eﬀectons are involved in the volume of macro-
and supereﬀectons (see below). Primary acoustic deformons may originate or
annihilate in such a way. However, the probability of collective spontaneous
emission of photons during (b → a)tr,lb transition of primary eﬀectons is much
higher than that of phonons, related to similar transition of macroeﬀectons (see
below), as it leads from our theory.

The coherent electromagnetic radiation as a result of self- correlation of
many dipole moments in composition of coherent cluster, like primary eﬀectons,
containing N ≫ 1 molecules is already known as superradiance (Dicke, 1954).
The time of collective transition in the case of superradiance is less than that
of isolated molecule and intensity of superradiance (I ∼ N · hν/τ ∼ N2) is
much bigger than that from the same number of independent molecules (I ∼
N · hν/T1 ∼ N). The (b → a) transition time of the primary eﬀectons has
the reverse dependence on the N (τ ∼ 1/N). The relaxation time for isolated
atoms or molecules (T1) is independent on N. The main energy is radiated in
the direction of most elongated volume, i.e. ends of tubes.

Secondary eﬀectons (tr and lb)

In contrast to primary eﬀectons, this type of quasiparticles is conventional.
They are the result of averaging of the frequencies and energies of the ”acoustic”
(a) and ”optical” (b) states of eﬀectons with packing numbers nP > 0, having
the resulting impulse more than zero. For averaging the energies of such states
the Bose-Einstein distribution was used under the condition when T < T0 (T0
is temperature of degeneration and, simultaneously, temperature of ﬁrst order
phase transition). Under this condition the chemical potential: µ = 0 and
distribution has a form of Plank equation.

Secondary eﬀectons (tr and lb)

In contrast to primary eﬀectons, the ”acoustic” (a) and ”optical” (b) states
of secondary (mean) eﬀectons are the result of averaging the energies of the
eﬀectons with packing numbers nP > 0, having the resulting impulse diﬀerent
from zero. For this averaging the Bose-Einstein distribution was used under
the condition: T < T0 (T0 is temperature of degeneration for mesoscopic
Bose condensation (BC), equal to temperature of ﬁrst order phase transition).
Under this condition it is assumed, that the chemical potential: µ ≃ 0 and
Bose-Einstein distribution has a form of Plank equation [4].

Secondary transitons (tr and lb)

Secondary transitons, like primary ones are intermediate transition state be-
tween (a) and (¯b) states of secondary eﬀecton - translational and librational. As
well as secondary eﬀectons, these quasiparticles are conditional, i.e. a result of
averaging. It is assumed that the volumes of secondary transitons and secondary
eﬀectons coincide. The ( ¯a ⇔ ¯b)tr,lb transition states of secondary eﬀectons, in
contrast to that of primary eﬀectons, are accompanied by the ﬂuctuation of
density. Secondary transitons are responsible for radiation and absorption of
phonons.

Secondary ”acoustic” deformons (tr and lb)

This type of quasiparticles is also conditional as a result of 3D superposi-
tion of averaged thermal phonons. These conventional phonons originate and
annihilate in a process of ( ¯a ⇔ ¯b)1,2,3 thermoactivated transitions of secondary
conventional eﬀectons. These states correspond to translational and librational
transitons.

Convertons (tr ⇔ lb)

These important excitations are introduced in our model as a reversible
transitions between translational and librational primary eﬀectons. The (acon)
convertons correspond to transitions between the (atr ⇋ alb) states of these
eﬀectons and (bcon) convertons - to that between their (btr ⇋ blb) states. As

10

far as the dimensions of translational primary eﬀectons are much less than libra-
tional ones, the convertons could be considered as [dissociation ⇋ association] of
the primary librational eﬀectons (coherent clusters). Both of convertons, (acon)
and (bcon), are accompanied by density ﬂuctuation, inducing phonons with cor-
responding frequency in the surrounding medium. All kinds of Convertons may
be termed ’ﬂickering’ clusters.

The ca- and cb- deformons, induced by convertons

Three-dimensional (3D) superposition of phonons, irradiated by two types
of convertons, acon and bcon, represents in our model the acoustic ca- and
cb-deformons. They have properties similar to that of secondary deformons,
discussed above.

The c-Macrotransitons (Macroconvertons) and c-Macrodeformons

Simultaneous excitation of the acon and bcon types of convertons in the vol-
ume of primary librational eﬀectons leads to origination of big ﬂuctuations, like
cavitational ones, termed c-Macrotransitons or Macroconvertons. In turn, cor-
responding density ﬂuctuations induce in surrounding medium high frequency
thermal phonons. The 3D-superposition these standing phonons forms c- Macrode-
formons.

Macroeﬀectons (tr and lb)

Macroeﬀectons (A and B) are collective simultaneous excitations of the pri-
mary and secondary eﬀectons in the [A ∼ (a, ¯a)]tr,lb and [B ∼ (b, ¯b)]tr,lb states
in the volume of primary electromagnetic translational and librational defor-
mons, respectively. This correlation of primary and secondary states results in
signiﬁcant deviations from thermal equilibrium. The A and B states of macroef-
fectons (tr and lb) may be considered as the most probable volume-orchestrated
(correlated) thermal ﬂuctuations of condensed matter.

Macrodeformons or Macrotransitons (tr and lb)

This type of conventional quasiparticles is considered in our model as an
intermediate transition state of macroeﬀectons. The (A → B)tr,lb and (B →
A)tr,lb transitions are represented by the coherent transitions of primary and sec-
ondary eﬀectons in the volume of primary electromagnetic deformons - transla-
tional and librational. The (A → B)tr,lb transition of macroeﬀecton is accompa-
nied by simultaneous absorption of 3 pairs of photons and that of phonons in the
form of electromagnetic deformons. If (B → A)tr,lb transition occurs without
emission of photons, then all the energy of the excited B-state is transmitted to
the energy of ﬂuctuation of density and entropy of Macroeﬀecton as an isolated
mesosystem. It is a dissipative process: transition from the more ordered struc-
ture of matter to the less one, termed Macrodeformons. The big ﬂuctuations of
density during (A ⇔ B)tr,lb transitions of macroeﬀectons, i.e. macrodeformons
are responsible for the Rayleigh central component in Brillouin spectra of light

11

scattering [15]. Translational and librational macrodeformons are also related
to the corresponding types of viscosity and self-diﬀusion [16]. The volumes of
macrotransitons, equal to that of macrodeformons (tr or lb) and macroeﬀec-
tons, coincide with that of tr or lb primary electromagnetic deformons,
correspondingly.

Supereﬀectons

This mixed type of conventional quasiparticles is composed of translational
and librational macroeﬀectons correlated in space and time in the volumes of
superimposed electromagnetic primary deformons (translational and librational
- simultaneously). Like macroeﬀectons, supereﬀectons may exist in the ground
(A∗
S) states representing strong deviations from thermal equi-
librium state.

S) and excited (B∗

Superdeformons or Supertransitons

This collective excitations have the lowest probability as compared to other
quasiparticles of our model. Like macrodeformons, superdeformons represent
the intermediate (A∗
S) transition state of supereﬀectons. In the course
of these transitions the translational and librational macroeﬀectons undergo
simultaneous

S ⇔ B∗

[(A ⇔ B)tr and (A ⇔ B)lb]

transitions

S → B∗

The (A∗
S) transition of supereﬀecton may be accompanied by the absorp-
tion of two electromagnetic deformons - translational and librational simultane-
ously. The reverse (B∗
S) relaxation may occur without photon radiation.
In this case the big cavitational ﬂuctuation originates. Such a process plays
an important role in the processes of sublimation, evaporation and boiling.

S → A∗

The equilibrium dissociation constant of the reaction:

H2O ⇋ H + + HO−

(2.6)

should be related with equilibrium constant of supertransitons: KB∗
A∗
activation of reversible dissociation of small fraction of water molecules.

S . The
S cavitational ﬂuctuation of supereﬀectons can be accompanied by the

S → B∗

⇋A∗

S

In contrast to primary and secondary transitons and deformons,
the notions of [macro- and supertransitons] and [macro- and superde-
formons] coincide. Such types of transitons and deformons represent the dy-
namic processes in the same volumes of corresponding primary electromagnetic
deformons.

Considering the transitions of all types of translational deformons (primary,
secondary and macrodeformons), one must keep in mind that the librational
type of modes remains the same. And vice versa, in case of librational defor-
mons, translational modes remain unchanged. Only the realization of a con-
vertons and supereﬀectons are accompanied by the interconversions between the
translational and librational modes, between translational and librational eﬀec-
tons.

Each next level in the hierarchy of quasiparticles (I - IV) introduced in
our model, is based on uniﬁcation of the properties of the previous ones. All
of these quasiparticles are constructed on the same physical principles. Part of
them is a result of 3D - superposition of diﬀerent types of standing waves: de
Broglie waves, IR electromagnetic photons and phonons.

Such a system in equilibrium state can be handled as a gas of
quasiparticles. As far each of the eﬀecton’s types: [tr] and [ lb], macroeﬀec-
tons [tr + lb] and supereﬀectons [tr/lb] have two states (acoustic and optic) the
total number of excitations, as one can calculate from the table above, is equal
to:

Nex = 31

This classiﬁcation reﬂects the duality of matter and ﬁeld and represent their

self-organization and interplay on mesoscopic and macroscopic levels.

Our hierarchical system includes a gradual transition from the Order (pri-
mary eﬀectons, transitons and deformons) to Disorder (macro- and superdefor-
mons). It is important, however, that in accordance with the model proposed,
this thermal Disorder is ”organized” by hierarchical superposition of deﬁnite
It means that the ﬁnal dynamics
types of the ordered quantum excitations.
condensed matter only ”looks” as chaotic one. Our approach makes it possible
to take into account the Hidden Order of Condensed Matter in form mesoscopic
Bose condensate and its dynamics for better understanding of Disorder.

The long-distance correlation between quasiparticles is determined mainly
by the biggest ones - an electromagnetic primary deformons, involving in its
volume a huge number of primary and secondary eﬀectons. The volume of
primary deformons [tr and lb] could be subdivided on two equal parts, within

13

the nodes of 3D standing IR electromagnetic waves. The big number of the
eﬀectons in each of these parts is equal also. The dynamics eﬀectons is correlated
in such a way, that when one half of their quantity in the volume of big primary
deformon undergo (a → b)tr,lb transitions, the other half of the eﬀectons undergo
the opposite (b → a)tr,lb transition. These processes may compensate each other
due to exchange of IR photons and phonons in equilibrium conditions.

The increasing or decreasing in the concentration of primary deformons is
directly related to the shift of (a ⇔ b)tr,lb equilibrium of the primary eﬀectons
leftward or rightward, respectively. This shift, in turn, leads also to correspond-
ing changes in the energies and concentrations of secondary eﬀectons, deformons
and, consequently, to that of super- and macro-deformons. It means the ex-
isting of feedback reaction between subsystems of the eﬀectons and
deformons, necessary for long-range self-organization in macroscopic
volumes of condensed matter.

ticles of condensed matter as a hierarchical dynamic system, based

particles, introduced in Hierarchic concept is 24. Six collective ex-
citations, related to convertons- interconversions between primary

14

librational and translational eﬀectons and their derivatives are not
represented here for the end of simplicity.

The situation is possible when spontaneous oscillations between the sub-
systems of eﬀectons and deformons are not accompanied by the change in the
total internal energy due to compensation eﬀect. In such a way a long-period
macroscopic oscillations in liquids, revealed experimentally (Chernicov, 1990a,
1990b), could be explained. Such kind of phenomena, related to equilib-
rium shift of two subsystems, could be responsible for long relaxation
(memory) of water containing systems after diﬀerent perturbations
(like magnetic treatment, ultra high dilution, etc.). The instability of
macrosystem arises from competition between discrete quantum and averaged
thermal equilibrium types of energy distributions of coherent molecular clus-
ters, as it leads from our theoretical calculations.

The total internal energy of substance is determined by the contributions of
all types of quasiparticles with due regard for their own energy, concentration
and probability of excitation. It leads from our simulations, that contributions
of super - and macroeﬀectons and corresponding super - and macrodeformons as
well as polyeﬀectons and coherent superclusters to the internal energy of matter
normally are small, due to their low probability of excitation, big volume and,
consequently, low concentration.

Polyeﬀectons and superclusters are the result of primary eﬀectons assembly
(one-dimensional, two- or three-dimensional), stabilized by Josephson’s junc-
tions.

The sizes of primary eﬀectons (translational and librational) determine the
mesoscopic scale of the condensed matter organization. Domains, nods, crys-
tallites, observed in solid bodies, liquid crystals, polymers and biopolymers are
the consequence of primary eﬀectons and their association.

3. THE MAIN STATEMENTS AND BASIC FORMULAE OF
HIERARCHIC MODEL

As far the acoustic (a) and optical (b) thermal coherent modes of molecules
in composition of elementary cells or bigger clusters of the condensed matter
are anharmonic, the quantum a ⇔ b transitions (beats) with absorption and
radiation of phonons or photons can exist.

The number of acoustic and optical modes is the same and equal
to three (Kaivarainen, 1995), if oscillation of all p-atoms in the basis
are coherent in both optical and acoustic dynamic states. Remnant
modes are degenerated.

The states of system, minimizing the uncertainty relation, when:

[∆p · ∆x ∼ ~ and ∆x = L ∼ ~/∆p]1,2,3

(3.1)

are quantum coherent states.

15

A system of the eﬀectons could be considered as a partially degenerate Bose-
gas. The degree of the degenerateness is proportional to the number of molecules
in the volume of primary eﬀectons. Degeneration in liquids grows up at lowering
temperature and make a jump up as a result of (liquid → solid) phase transition
as it leads from our theory and computer calculations.

It is known from the Bose-Einstein theory of condensation, developed by

London (1938), that if the degeneration factor:

is close to λ ≃1 at a low chemical potential value:

λ = exp(µ/kT )

µ ≪ kT

(3.2)

(3.2a)

then the contribution of bosons with the resulting impulse Pef ≃ 0 (like

primary eﬀectons) cannot be neglected, when calculating internal energy.

We assume in our theory that for all types of primary and secondary eﬀectons

of condensed matter (solids and liquids), the condition (3.2a) is valid.

Partial Bose-Einstein condensation leads to the coherence of the waves B of
molecules and atoms forming primary eﬀectons in the both: acoustic (a) and
optic (b) states. Primary eﬀectons are described with wave functions coherent
in the volume of an eﬀecton.

In non ideal Bose-gas, despite the partial Bose-condensation, the quasiparti-
cles exist with nonzero impulse, termed as secondary eﬀectons. These eﬀectons
obeys the Bose-Einstein statistics.

The sizes of primary eﬀectons determine the mesoscopic scale of the con-
densed matter organization. According to our model, the domains, nods,
crystallites, and clusters observed in solid bodies and in liquid crys-
tals, polymers and biopolymers - can be a consequence of primary
translational or librational eﬀectons.

Stabilization of molecules, atoms or ions in composition of coherent clus-
ters (eﬀectons) and correlation between diﬀerent eﬀectons could be provided
by distant Van der Waals interaction and new Resonant Vibro-Gravitational
Interaction, introduced in our theory (see Section 10.4).

It leads from quantitative consequences of mesoscopic concept, that [gas
→ liquid] phase transition is related with appearance the conditions for par-
tial Bose-condensation, when the primary librational eﬀectons, containing more
than one molecule emerge (Kaivarainen, 1995, 1996). At the same time it means
the beginning of degeneration when the chemical potential µ → 0. At this con-
dition wave B length, corresponding to librations, starts to exceed the mean
distances between molecules in the liquid phase.

It means that the temperature, at which the phase transition [gas → liquid ]
occurs, coincides with the temperature of partial Bose- condensation (Tc), [i.e.
primary librational eﬀectons formation] and degeneration temperature (T0).

The changes of quasiparticles volume and shape in three dimensional

(3D) space are related to corresponding changes in the impulse space.

The total macroscopic Bose-condensation, in accordance with our model,
responds to conditions, when [a ⇔ b] equilibrium of primary eﬀectons strongly
shifts to the main (a)- state and (b)- state becomes thermally inaccessible.

16

At the same time the wave B length tends to macroscopic value. For quantum
systems at temperature (T) higher than degeneration temperature T0 (T > T0),
when chemical potential (µi = ∂Gi/∂ni) < 0 has a negative value, the mean
number of Bose-particles (ni) in state (i) is determined by the Bose- Einstein
distribution:

ni = {exp[(ǫi − µi)/kT ] − 1}−1

(3.3)

where ǫi is the energy of the particle in state (i). For ”normal” condensed
matter ǫi ≫ µ ≪ kT .

The Bose-Einstein statistics, in contrast to the Maxwell- Boltzmann statis-
tics, is applied to the indistinguishable Bose- particles with zero or integer spin
values. The Fermi-Dirac distribution is valid for systems of indistinguishable
particles with a semi-integer spin obeying the Pauli principle.

In the case of condensed matter at the temperature:

N∗ particles of Bose condensate have a zero impulse (Ashkroft, Mermin, 1976):

0 < T < [T0 ∼= Tc]

N ∗ ≃ N [1 − (T /T0)3/2]

(3.4)

where N is the total number of particles in a system.

3.1. Parameters of individual de Broglie waves (waves B)

The known de Broglie relation expressing Wave-Particle Duality, has a simple

form:

where ~k = 2π/~λ = 1/~LB is the wave number of wave B with length ~λ =
2π~LB,
~p is the impulse (momentum) of particle with mass (m) and group
velocity (vgr), ~ = h/2π is the Plank constant.

Each particle can be represented as wave packet with group velocity:

and phase velocity:

where: ωB is the angle frequency of wave B determining the total energy of the
wave B : (EB = ~ωB).

Total energy is equal to the sum of kinetic (Tk) and potential (VB) energies
and is related to particle’s mass and product of phase and group velocities
(vgrvph) as follows (Grawford, 1973):

EB = ~ωB = Tk + VB = (~k)2

(3.4b)

where (m) is particle mass; (c) is light velocity.

sponding primary waves B in the directions 1,2,3 in a and b states of primary

The distribution (3.5) coincides with the Plank formula, for the case when

frequency of a quantum oscillator is equal to the frequency of photon and:

(3.5)

(3.8)

νp = npνp

18

where ¯np = [exp(hνp/kT − 1)]−1 is the mean number of photons with the fre-
quency νp..

The transition a → b means that ¯np

increases by one

νb = νa + νp = nνp + νp = νp(n + 1)

(3.9)

The derivation of the formula (3.5) is based upon the assumption that (a ⇔
b)1,2,3 transitions are analogous to the beats in a system of two weakly inter-
acting quantum oscillators.

In such a case the frequency (ν1,2,3

) of photons is equal to the diﬀerence
between the frequencies of waves B forming a primary eﬀectons in (b) and (a)
states as a frequency of quantum beats (Grawford, 1973):

In our model energies of quasiparticles in each state are thus determined only
by the three selected coherent modes in directions (1,2,3). All remnant degrees
of freedom: (3n − 3), where n is the number of molecules forming eﬀectons or
deformons, are degenerated due to their coherence.

3.3. Phase velocities of standing de Broglie waves, forming new types of
quasiparticles

In crystals three phonons with diﬀerent phase velocities can propagate in
the direction set by the longitudinal wave normal. In a general case, two quasi-
transversal waves ”fast” (vf
⊥) and one quasi-longitudinal (vk)
wave propagate (Ashkroft and Mermin, 1976).

⊥) and ”slow” (vs

The propagation of transversal acoustic waves is known to be accompa-
nied by smaller deformations of the lattice than that of longitudinal waves,
when they are caused by external
impulses. The thermal phonons, sponta-
neously originating and annihilating under conditions of heat equilibrium may
be accompanied by even smaller perturbations of the structure and could be
considered as transversal phonons.

Therefore, we assume, that in the absence of external impulses in solid state:
and the resulting thermal phonons velocity is determined as:

vf
⊥ ≈ vs

⊥ = v1,2,3

ph

s = (v(1)
vres

⊥ v(2)

⊥ v(3)

⊥ )1/3 = vph

(3.24)

21

In liquids the resulting sound speed has an isotropic value:

vliq
s = vph.

According to our model, the resulting velocity of elastic waves in condensed me-
dia is related to the phase velocities of primary and secondary eﬀectons in both
(acoustic and optic) states and that of deformons (translational and librational)
in the following way:

vs = fava

Nevertheless, (a → b)tr,lb or (b → a)tr,lb transitions of primary eﬀectons are
mainly related with absorption or emission of photons, the rate of such process
(relaxation time) is limited by the rate of changing the mode of oscillations in
(a) and (b) state, i.e. by sound velocity (vs = vph). The phonons [absorp-
tion/radiation] during these transitions could accompanied the like processes in
composition of macrodeformons;

are the resulting frequencies of the mean eﬀectons in ¯b and ¯a states. They can
be estimated according to eqs. (3.17 and 3.16).

Using eqs.

(3.25 and 3.30), we ﬁnd the formulas for the resulting phase

velocities of the primary translational and librational eﬀectons in (a) state:

Similarly, for the resulting phase velocity of secondary eﬀectons in (a) state we
get from (3.26) and (3.31):

As will be shown below, it is necessary to know va

the concentration of the primary and secondary eﬀectons. When the values of
resulting phase velocities in a and ¯a states of eﬀectons are known, then from
eqs. (3.30) and (3.31) it is easy to express resulting phase velocities in b and ¯b
states of translational and librational eﬀectons.

3.4. Concentrations of quasiparticles, introduced in Hierarchic model of
condensed matter

It has been shown by Rayleigh that the concentration of the standing waves

of any type with wave lengths within the range: λ to λ + dλ is equal to:

or, expressing wave lengths via their frequencies and phase velocities λ = vph/ν
we obtain:

nλdλ =

4πdλ

For calculation the concentration of standing waves within the frequency range
from zero to the deﬁnite characteristic frequency, for example, to the most
probable (νa) or mean (¯νa) frequency of wave B, then eq.
(3.38) should be

Jeans has shown that each standing wave formed by photons or phonons can
be polarized twice. Taking into account this fact the concentrations of standing
photons and standing phonons in the all three directions (1,2,3) are equal to:

where: [c] and [n] are the light speed in vacuum and refraction index of matter;
vph = vs - velocity of thermal phonons, equal to sound velocity.

The standing waves B of atoms and molecules have only one linear polariza-
tion in directions (1,2,3). Therefore, their concentrations are described by an
equation of type (3.39).

According to our model (see Introduction), superposition of each of three
diﬀerently oriented (1,2,3) standing waves B forms quasi-particles which we have
termed eﬀectons. They are divided into the most probable (primary) (with zero
resulting impulse) and mean (secondary) eﬀectons. Quasiparticles, formed by
3D superposition of standing photons and phonons, originating in the course
of (a ⇔ b) and (¯a ⇔ ¯b) transitions of the primary and secondary eﬀectons,
respectively, are termed primary and secondary deformons (Table 1).

Eﬀectons and deformons are the result of thermal translations (tr) and libra-
tions (lb) of molecules in directions (1,2,3). These quasiparticles are generally
approximated by a parallelepiped with symmetry axes (1,2,3).

24

As far three coherent standing waves of corresponding nature take part in
the construction of each eﬀecton, it means that the concentration of such quasi-
particles must be three times lower than the concentration of standing waves
expressed by eq. (3.39). The coherence of molecules in the volume of the ef-
fectons and deformons due to partial Bose-condensation is the most important
feature of our model, which leads to degeneration of waves B of these molecules.
Finally, we obtain the concentration of primary eﬀectons, primary

transitons and convertons:

4. HIERARCHIC THERMODYNAMICS

4.1. The internal energy of matter as a hierarchical system
of collective excitations

26

The quantum theory of crystal heat capacity leads to the following equation

for the density of thermal internal energy (Ashkroft, Mermin, 1976):

i
P
P
where V - the crystal volume; Ei - the energy of the i-stationary state.

ǫ =

i

1
V

Ei exp(−Ei/kT )
exp(−Ei/kT )

(4.1)

According to our Hierarchic theory, the internal energy of matter is deter-
mined by the concentration (ni) of each type of quasiparticles, probabilities of
excitation of each of their states (Pi) and the energies of corresponding states
(Ei). The condensed matter is considered as an ”ideal gas” of 3D standing
waves of diﬀerent types (quasiparticles and collective excitations). However,
the dynamic equilibrium between types of quasiparticles is very sensitive to the
external and internal perturbations.

The total partition function - the sum of the relative probabilities of excita-

tion of all states of quasiparticles is equal to:

The analogous situation is with probabilities of a, b and cM convertons and
corresponding acoustic deformons excitations: Pac, Pbc and PcMd = PcMt. So
it is a reason for taking them into account in the partition function only ones.

The intramolecular conﬁgurational dynamics of molecules is automatically
taken into account in our approach as it has an inﬂuence on the intermolecular
dynamics, dimensions, and on concentration of quasiparticles as well as on the
energy of excitation of their states. These dynamics aﬀects the positions of the
absorption bands in oscillatory spectra and values of sound velocity, that we use
for calculation of internal energy.

Substituting the parameters of quasiparticles, calculated in this way into
eqs. (4.2 and 4.3), we obtain the total internal energy of one mole of matter
in solid or liquid phase. For water and ice the theoretical results coincide with
experimental one fairly well (see Fig. 2).

It is important that our equations are the same for solid and liq-
uid states. The diﬀerence in experimental parameters, such as molar volume,
sound velocity, refraction index, positions of translational and librational bands
determines the diﬀerence of internal energy and of more than 100 another pa-
rameters of any state of condensed matter, which can be calculated using eq.
(4.3). It is important to stress that our concept is general for solids
and liquids, for crystals, glasses and amorphous matter.

4.2. The contributions of kinetic and potential
energy to the total internal energy

The total internal energy of matter (U tot) is equal to the sum of total kinetic

(T tot) and total potential (V tot) energy:

The kinetic energy of wave B (TB) of one molecule may be expressed using
its total energy (EB), mass of molecule (m), and its phase velocity as wave B
(vph):

The total mass (Mi) of 3D standing waves B forming eﬀectons, transitons and
deformons of diﬀerent types are proportional to number of molecules in the
volume of corresponding quasiparticle (Vi = 1/ni):

the limiting condition for minimum mass of quasiparticle is:

The kinetic energy of coherent primary and secondary deformons and tran-
sitons we express analogously to eq. (4.34), but instead of the phase velocity

respectively:

Total potential energy is deﬁned by the diﬀerence between total internal (eq.
4.3) and total kinetic energy (eq. 4.36):

V tot = U tot − T tot

(4.39)

Consequently, we can separately calculate the kinetic and potential energy con-
tributions to the total thermal internal energy of matter, using four experimental
parameters, obtained at the same temperature and pressure:

1) density or molar volume;
2) sound velocity;
3) refraction index and
4) positions of translational and librational bands in oscillatory spectrum of

condensed matter.

liquids and solids.

It is important to stress that the same equations are valid for

The contributions of all individual types of quasiparticles in thermodynamics
as well as a lot of characteristics of these quasiparticles also may be calculated,
using hierarchic theory.

4.3. Some useful parameters of condensed matter

The total Structural Factor can be calculated as a ratio of the kinetic to

the total energy of matter:

SF = T tot/U tot

(4.40)

The structural factors, related to contributions of translations (SFtr) and to
librations (SFlb) could be calculated separately as:

SF tr = Ttr/U tot

and

SF lb = Tlb/U tot

the life-time of Macroconvertons is:

(4.43)

The cycle-period of (ac) and (bc) convertons are determined by the sum of
life-times of intermediate states of primary translational and librational eﬀec-
tons:

The life-times of primary and secondary eﬀectons (lb and tr) in a- and b-

states are the reciprocal values of corresponding state frequencies:

5. QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION OF HIERARCHIC
THEORY
ON EXAMPLES OF ICE AND WATER

All the calculations, based on Hierarchic theory, were performed on the
personal computers. The special software: ”Comprehensive analyzer of matter
properties” [copyright 1997, Kaivarainen] was worked out. This program allows
to evaluate more than three hundred parameters of any condensed matter if the
following basic experimental data are available in the temperature interval of
interest:

1. Positions of translational and librational bands in IR spectra;
2. Sound velocity;
3. Molar volume;
4. Refraction index.

The basic experimental parameters for ice:

The wave numbers (˜νtr), corresponding to positions of translational and
librational bands in oscillatory IR spectra were taken from book of Eisenberg
and Kauzmann (1969). Wave numbers for ice at 0oC are:

The equality of wave numbers for three directions (1,2,3) indicate the spatial
isotropy of the librations of H2O molecules. In this case deformons and eﬀectons
have a cube geometry. In general case they have a shape of parallelepiped (like
quasiparticles of translational type) with each of three ribs, corresponding to
most probable de Broglie wave length in selected direction.

This velocity and molar ice volume (V0) are almost independent on temperature

via light velocity as: ν = c˜ν

The dependence of sound velocity (vs) in water on temperature within the
temperature range 0 − 1000C is expressed by the polynomial (Fine and Millero,
1973):

The temperature dependence of molar volume (V0) of water within the same
temperature range can be calculated using the polynomial (Kell, 1975; Kikoin,
1976):

vs = 1402.385 + 5.03522t − 58.3087 · 10−3t2 +

/(1 + 1.687985 · 10−2t)]

(cm3/M )

The refraction index for ice was taken as an independent of temperature (nice =
1.35) and that for water as a variable, depending on temperature in accordance
with experimental data, presented by Frontas’ev and Schreiber (1966).

The refraction index for water at 200C is approximately:

42

nH2O ≃ 1.33

The temperature dependences of diﬀerent parameters for ice and water, com-
puted using the formulas of our mesoscopic theory, are presented in Figs.(1-4).
It is only a small part of available information. In principle, it is possible to cal-
culate about 200 diﬀerent parameters for liquid and solid state of any condensed
matter [3].

5.1. Discussion of theoretical temperature dependences and
comparison with experimental data

It will be shown below that our hierarchic theory makes it possible to cal-
culate unprecedented big amount of parameters for liquids and solids. Those
of them that where measured experimentally and taken from literature are in
excellent correspondence with theory.

Fig. 1. (a, b, c). Temperature dependences of the resulting ther-
moaccessibility (Z) (eq.4.2) and contributions related to primary
and secondary eﬀectons and deformons for ice (a,b) and water (c).

43

The resulting thermoaccessibility minimum (Fig. 1a) for ice (Z) corresponds
to the temperature of -1700C. The interval from -198 to -1730C is known indeed
as anomalies one due to the fact that the heat equilibrium of ice establishes very
slowly in the above range (Maeno, 1988). This fact can be explained by the less
probable ice structure (minimum value of partition function Z ) near −1700C.
For the other hand, experimental anomaly, related with maximum heat
capacity (Cp), also is observed near the same temperature. It can be explained,
if we present heat capacity as:

Cp =

∂
∂T

(

1
Z

U ∗) = −

1
Z 2

∂Z
∂T

U ∗ +

1
Z

∂U ∗
∂T

One can see, that heat capacity is maximal, when (∂Z/∂T ) = 0 and Z is min-
imal.
It is a condition of Z(T) extremum, just leading from our theory at
-1700C (Fig.1a).

In liquid water the temperature dependences of Z and its components are
linear. The thermoaccessibility of mean secondary eﬀectons in water decreases,
while that of primary eﬀectons increases with temperature, just like in ice (Fig.
1 b,c).

Fig. 2.

(a,b). Temperature dependences of the total internal
energy (Utot) and diﬀerent contributions for ice (a) and water (b)
(eqs. 4.3 - 4.5). Following contributions to Utot are presented:

(Uef + ¯Uef ) is the contribution of primary and secondary eﬀec-
tons; (Ud + ¯Ud) is the contribution of primary and secondary de-
formons; (Uef + Ud) is the contribution of primary eﬀectons and
deformons;

( ¯Uef + ¯Ud) is the contribution of secondary eﬀectons and defor-

mons.

It leads from our calculations, that contributions of macro- and supereﬀec-
tons to the total internal energy and that of macro- and superdeformons, as

44

well as all types of convertons, are much smaller than those of primary and
secondary eﬀectons and deformons.

On lowering down the temperature the total internal energy of ice (Fig. 2a)
and its components decreases with temperature coming closer to absolute zero.
The same parameters for water are decreasing almost linearly within the interval
(100 − 0)0C (Fig. 2b).

In computer calculations, the values of Cp(t) can be determined by diﬀeren-

tiating Utot numerically at any of temperature interval.

It follows from Fig. 2a that the mean value of heat capacity for ice in the

interval from -75 to 0oC is equal to:

energy is: ∆U = 17 − 9.7 = 7.3kJ/M (Fig.2b). This corresponds to mean value
of heat capacity of water:

These results of our theory agree well with the experimental mean values

Cp = 18 Cal/M K for water and Cp = 9cal/M K for ice.

Mesoscopic molecular Bose condensation at physiological
temperature: possible or not?

The possibility of existence of mesoscopic (intermediate between microscopic
and macroscopic) Bose condensation in form of coherent clusters in condensed
matter at the ambient temperature was rejected for a long time. The reason
of such shortcoming was a wrong primary assumption, that the thermal
oscillations of atoms and molecules in condensed matter are the harmonic
ones (see for example: Beck and Eccles, 1992). The condition of harmonic
oscillations means that the averaged kinetic (T k) and potential (V ) energy of
molecules are equal to each other and linearly dependent on temperature (T).
This condition leads from Virial theorem (Clausius, 1870) for the

case of classical systems:

The averaged kinetic energy of the oscillating particle may be expressed via

its averaged impulse (p) and mass (m):

The most probable wave B length (λB) of such particle, based on assumption

(5.1), is:

(5.1)

(5.1a)

(5.2)

T k = V =

kT

1
2

T k = p2/2m

λB = h/p = h/(mkT )1/2

45

It leads from this formula that around the melting point of ice: T = 273K
the value of λB is less than 1˚A and much less than the approximate distance
between centers of molecules (l ˜ 3˚A) in ice and water:

λB < l

(5.2a)

This result leads to wrong conclusion that water and ice are classical
systems, where Bose condensation (BC) is impossible. The same
wrong conclusion, based on 5.1 and 5.2 follows for any condensed
matter at T around its melting point.

The BC is possible only at conditions, when the wave B of particles
is equal or bigger, than the average distance between their centers
(l):

λB ≥ l = (V0/N0)1/3

(5.2b)

In contrast to low-temperature macroscopic BC, accompanied supercon-
ductivity and superﬂuidity, the condition of mesoscopic high temperature BC
may be expressed as:

L > λB > l

(5.2c)

where L is a macroscopic parameter, comparable with dimensions of the

whole sample.

Condition of partial or mesoscopic BC (5.2c) is general for any liq-
uids and solids as conﬁrmed by our theory and computer simulations
for water and ice.

Correct comparisons of ratio between average kinetic and potential
energy of matter and applying to Virial theorem may give a right
answer to question: is this system classical or quantum ?

It leads from our theoretical dependencies, presented at Fig. 3 a, b that the
total kinetic energy of water (Tkin) is approximately 30 times less than the
potential energy (Vp) at the same temperatures. In the case of ice, they diﬀer
even more: (Tkin/V ) < 1/100. The resulting Tkinof water increases almost twice
over the range (0 − 1000C) : from 313 to 585J/M . However, the change of the
total internal energy (Utot = Tkin + Vp) is determined mainly by the change in
potential energy Vp(t) of ice and water.

potential (Vp) energy for the ice (a) and water (b), calculated, using
eqs.(4.36), .(4.39). . Note that Utot = Tkin + Vp and was calculated
from eq.(4.3).

We can analyze the above ratio between total kinetic and potential energies
in terms of the Viral theorem worked out by Clausius (Clausius, 1870; see also
Prokhorov, 1988). It is important to note, that this theorem is valid for both:
classical and quantum-mechanical systems.

This famous theorem for a system of any kind of particles system - relates
i /2 and potential ¯V (r) energies in the

The potential energy V (r) is a homogeneous n-order function like:

V (r) ∼ rn

(5.3)

where the value of power (n) is equal to ratio of doubled average kinetic

energy to average potential energy:

n =

2Tk(~v)
V (r)

(5.3a)

For example, for a harmonic oscillator: n = 2 and ¯Tk = ¯V . For Coulomb

interaction: n = −1 and ¯T = − ¯V /2.

For water our calculation of Tk and V gives: nw ∼ 1/15 and for ice: nice ∼
1/50. It follows from (5.1) that in water and ice the dependence of potential
energy on distance (r) is very weak:

Vw(r) ∼ r(1/15);

Vice ∼ r(1/50)

(5.4)

These results can be considered as indication of distant interactions in water

and ice, as an associative cooperative systems.

We get here a strong evidence that water and ice can not be con-

sidered as a classical systems, following condition (5.1).

It is important also to note, that the direct interrelation exists between
the inﬁnitive spatial scale of Bose condensation, determined by wave B length:
λ = (h/p) → ∞ (eq.5.2) and condition of nonlocality as independence of
potential on distance at Tk → 0; p → 0; n → 0:

V (r) → const

(5.4a)

This result is true not only for real condensed matter systems,
but also for systems of virtual particles, forming the vacuum (see:
http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0003001).

5.2. Explanation of temperature anomalies,
nonmonotonic T-deviations in aqueous systems

Hierarchic theory is the ﬁrst one enable to predict and give a clear explana-
tion to deviations of temperature dependencies of some physical parameters of
water from monotonic ones.

It clarify also the interrelation between these deviations (transitions) and
corresponding temperature anomalies in properties of biosystems, such as large-
scale dynamics of proteins, the enzymes activity, dynamic equilibrium of [assembly-
disassembly] of microtubules and actin ﬁlaments, etc.

Fig. 4. (a) : The temperature dependencies of the number of

H2O molecules in the volume of primary librational eﬀecton (nlb

right axis);

M )ef , left

The number of H2O molecules within the primary libration eﬀectons
of water, which could be approximated by a cube, decreases from nM = 280
at 00 to nM ≃ 3 at 1000 (Fig. 4a). It should be noted that at physiological
temperatures (35 − 400) such quasiparticles contain nearly 40 water molecules.
This number is close to that of water molecules that can be enclosed in the open
interdomain protein cavities judging from X-ray data. The ﬂickering of these
clusters, i.e. their (dissociation ⇋ association) due to [lb ⇔ tr] conversions
in accordance with our model is directly related to the large-scale dynamics of
proteins.

It is important that the linear dimensions of such water clusters (11˚A) at
physiological temperature are close to dimensions of protein domains (Fig. 4b).
Such spatial correlation indicate that the properties of water ex-
erted a strong inﬂuence on the evolution of biopolymers, namely,
their dimensions and dynamic properties due to ”ﬂickering” of inter-
subunit water clusters.

We assume here that integer and half-integer values of number of water
molecules per eﬀecton’s edge [κ] (Fig. 4a) reﬂect the conditions of increased and

48

decreased stabilities of water structure correspondingly. It is apparently related
to the stability of primary librational eﬀectons as cooperative and coherent
water clusters.

Nonmonotonic behavior of water properties with temperature is widely known
and well conﬁrmed experimental fact (Drost-Hansen, 1976, 1992; Clegg and
Drost-Hansen, 1991; Etzler, 1991; Roberts and Wang, 1993; Roberts and Wang,
1993; Roberts, et al., 1993, 1994; Wang et al., 1994).

We can explain this interesting and important for biological func-
tions phenomenon because of competition between two factors: quan-
tum and structural ones in stability of primary librational eﬀectons.
The quantum factor such as wave B length, determining the value of the

eﬀecton edge:

lef = κ(V0/N0)1/3 ˜ λB

(5.5)

h

lb
i

decreases monotonously with temperature increasing. The structural fac-
lH2O =
tor is a sensitive parameter depending on the H2O eﬀective length:
(V0/N0)1/3
and their number [κ] in the eﬀecton’s edge, approximated by
cube.

We suggest that when (lef ) corresponds to integer number of H2O, i.e.

[κ = (lef /lH2O) = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...]lb

(5.6)

the competition between quantum and structural factors is minimum and pri-
mary librational eﬀectons are most stable. On the other hand, when (lef /lH2O)lb
is half-integer, the librational eﬀectons are less stable (the competition is maxi-
mum). In the latter case (a ⇔ b)lb equilibrium of the eﬀectons must be shifted
rightward - to less stable state of these coherent water clusters. Consequently,
the probability of dissociation of librational eﬀectons to a number of much
smaller translational eﬀecton, i.e. probability of [lb/tr] convertons increases
and concentration of primary librational eﬀectons decreases. Experimentally
the nonmonotonic change of this probability with temperature could be reg-
istered by dielectric permittivity, refraction index measurements and by that
of average density of water. The refraction index change should lead to corre-
sponding variations of surface tension, vapor pressure, viscosity, self-diﬀusion in
accordance to our hierarchic theory (Kaivarainen, 1995, 2000).

In accordance to our model the density of liquid water in compo-
sition of librational eﬀectons is lower than the average in the bulk
water. In the former case all hydrogen bonds of molecules are saturated like in
ideal ice in contrast to latter one.

We can see from Fig.4a that the number of water molecules in primary lb

eﬀecton edge (κ) is integer near the following temperatures:

60(κ = 6); 170(κ = 5); 320(κ = 4); 490(κ = 3); 770(κ = 2)

(5.7)

These temperatures coincide very well with the maximums of relaxation time in
pure water and with dielectric response anomalies (Roberts, et al., 1993; 1994;
Wang, et al., 1994). The special temperatures predicted by our theory are close
also to chemical kinetic (Aksnes, Asaad, 1989; Aksnes, Libnau, 1991), refrac-
tometry (Frontas’ev, Schreiber 1966) and IR (Prochorov, 1991) data. Small

49

discrepancy may result from the high sensitivity of water to any kind of pertur-
bation, guest-eﬀects and additional polarization of water molecules, induced by
high frequency visible photons. Even such low concentrations of inorganic ions
ester and NaOH as used by Aksnes and Libnau (1991) may change water proper-
ties. The increase of H2O polarizability under the eﬀect of light also may lead to
enhancement of water clusters stability and to corresponding high-temperature
shift of nonmonotonic changes of water properties.

The semi integer numbers of [κ] for pure water correspond to temperatures:

00(κ = 6.5); 120(κ = 5.5); 240(κ = 4.5); 400(κ = 3.5);
620(κ = 2.5); 990(κ = 1.5)

(5.7a)

The conditions (5.7a) characterize the less stable water structure than con-
ditions (5.7). The ﬁrst order phase transitions - freezing at 00 and boiling at
1000 of water almost exactly correspond to κ = 6.5 and κ = 1.5. This fact is
important for understanding the mechanism of ﬁrst order phase transitions.

The temperature anomalies of colloid water-containing systems,
discovered by Drost-Hansen (1976) and studied by Etzler and coauthors (1987;
1991) occurred near 14-160; 29-320; 44-460 and 59-620C. At these temperatures
the extrema of viscosity, disjoining pressure and molar excess entropy of water
between quartz plates even with a separation 300-500 ˚A has been observed.
These temperatures are close to predicted by our theory for bulk water anoma-
lies, corresponding to integer values of [κ] (see 5.7). Some deviations can be a
result of interfacial water perturbations, induced by colloid particles and plates.
It is a ﬁrst theory which looks to be able to predict and explain the existence
of Drost-Hansen temperatures.

The dimensions, concentration and stability of water clusters (primary li-
brational eﬀectons) in the volume of vicinal water should be bigger than that
in bulk water due to their less mobility and to longer waves B length.

Interesting ideas, concerning the role of water clusters in biosystems were

developed in works of John Watterson (1988a,b).

It was revealed in our laboratory (Kaivarainen, 1985; Kaivarainen et al.,
1993) that nonmonotonic changes of water near Drost-Hansen temperatures are
accompanied by in-phase change of diﬀerent protein large-scale dynamics, re-
lated to their functioning. The further investigations of like phenomena are very
important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of thermoadaptation of
living organisms.

5.3. Physiological temperature and the least action principle

The Fig.5 a, b shows the resulting contributions to the total kinetic energy
of water of two main subsystems: eﬀectons and deformons. The minimum of
deformons contribution at 430 is close to the physiological temperatures for
warm-blooded animals.

50

Fig. 5. Temperature dependences of two resulting contributions

- eﬀectons (T ef
energy of water.

The minima at temperature dependences of diﬀerent contributions to the total
kinetic energy of water at Fig.5 correspond to the best implementation of the
least action principle in the form of Mopertui-Lagrange.

In such a form, this principle is valid for the conservative holonom systems,
where limitations exist for the displacements of the particles of this sys-
tem, rather than the magnitudes of their velocities. It states that among
all the kinematically possible displacements of a system from one conﬁguration
to another, without changing total system energy, such a displacements are most
probable for which the action (W) is least: ∆W = 0. Here ∆ is the symbol of
total variation in coordinates, velocities and time.

The action is a fundamental physical parameter which has the dimension of

the product of energy and time characterizing the dynamics of a system.

According to Hamilton, the action:

(5.8)

(5.9)

is expressed through the Lagrange function:

where Tkin and V are the kinetic and potential energies of a system or a sub-
system.

According to Lagrange, the action (W) can be expressed as:

W =

2Tkindt

(5.10)

S =

Ldt

t

Zt0

L = Tkin − V,

t

Zt0

51

We can assume that at the same integration limit the minimum value of the
action ∆W ≃ 0 corresponds to the minimum value of Tkin.. Then it can be said
that at temperature about 430 the subsystems of deformons is most stable (see
Fig. 6). This means that the equilibrium between the acoustic and optic states
of primary and secondary eﬀectons should be most stable at this temperature.

5.4. Mechanism of the 1st and 2nd order phase transitions
in terms of the hierarchic theory

The abrupt increase of the total internal energy (U) as a result of ice melting
(Fig. 6a), equal to 6.27kJ/M , calculated from our theory is close to the experi-
mental data (6kJ/M ) (Eisenberg, 1969). The resulting thermoaccessibility (Z)
during [ice → water] transition decreases abruptly, while potential and kinetic
energies increase (Fig. 6b).

Fig. 6. The total internal energy (U = Tkin + Vp) change during
ice-water phase transition and change of the resulting thermoacces-
sibility (Z) - (a); changes in kinetic (Tkin) and potential (Vp) energies
(b) as a result of the same transition.

It is important that at the melting point H2O molecules number in a primary
translational eﬀecton (ntr
M )ef decreases from 1 to ≃ 0.4 (Fig. 7a). It means that
the volume of this quasiparticle type gets smaller than the volume occupied by
H2O molecule. According to our model, under such conditions the individual
water molecules get the independent translation mobility. The number of water
molecules forming a primary libration eﬀecton decreases abruptly from about
3000 to 280, as a result of melting. The number of H2O in the secondary
librational eﬀecton decreases correspondingly from ∼ 1.25 to 0.5 (Fig. 7b).

Fig. 8a, b contains more detailed information on changes in primary libra-

tional eﬀecton parameters in the course of ice melting.

The theoretical dependences obtained allow us to give a clear interpretation
of the ﬁrst order phase transitions. The condition of melting at T = Tcr is
realized in the course of heating when the number of molecules in the volume
of primary translational eﬀectons nM decreases:

The process of boiling, i.e. [liquid → gas] transition, as seen from Fig. 7a,
is also determined by condition (5.11), but at this case it is realized for primary
librational eﬀectons.

This means that [gas → liquid] transition is related to origination (condensa-
tion) of the primary librational eﬀectons which contain more than one molecule
of substance.

In a liquid as compared to gas, the quantity of rotational degrees of freedom
is decreased due to librational coherent eﬀectons formation, but the number of
translational degrees of freedom remains the same.

The translational degrees of freedom, in turn, also decreases, however, during
[liquid → solid] phase transition, when the wave B length of molecules corre-
sponding to their translations begins to exceed the mean distances between the
centers of molecules (Fig. 7a). This process is accompanied by partial Bose-
condensation of translational waves B and by the formation of coherent primary
translational eﬀectons, including more than one molecule. The size of librational
eﬀectons grows up abruptly during [water → ice] transition.

The enlarged primary librational eﬀectons and librational polyeﬀectons, orig-
inating from the eﬀectons ”side-to-side” assembly due to Josephson’ junctions,
may serve as a centers of crystallization, necessary for [liquid → solid] transi-
tion. We assume here that probability of mesoscopic Bose condensation (BC)
of molecules, involved in translations, as a condition of [liquid-solid] transition,
increases in vicinity of crystallization centers, stimulated by interfacial eﬀects.
The process of polyeﬀectons formation in very pure water is slow due to rela-
tively low probability of their collision, necessary for primary eﬀectons assembly.
Such mechanism may be responsible for getting the supercooled water, i.e. liq-
uid water, existing few degrees below 00C. The presence of impurities in form
of colloid particles in water - stimulates the enlargement of librational eﬀectons
and their assembly, increasing in such a way the temperature of [water → ice]
phase transition and making it closer to 00C. The opposite sharp transition
of pure [ice → water], however, occur always at 00C at normal pressure of 1
atm. We may explain this phenomenon because the uniﬁed system of primary
[translational + librational BC] of ice is more cooperative than the system of
only librational BC of water. Consequently, the reaction of ice to temperature
is more sensitive, than that of water and phase transition [ice → water] is more
sharp, than [water → ice].

In contrast to ﬁrst order phase transitions, the 2nd order phase
transitions are not related to the abrupt change of primary eﬀectons volume
and concentration, but only to their stability, related to their (a ⇋ b)1,2,3
tr,lb
equilibrium shift, symmetry changes and polymerization. Such phe-
nomena may be a result of a gradual [temperature/pressure] - dependent de-
crease in the diﬀerence between the energy of ai and bi states of one of three
i

standing waves B, forming primary eﬀectons

The non-monotonic changes of sound velocity and the low-frequency shift
of translational and librational bands in oscillatory spectra, according to our
theory, should be followed by jump of heat capacity, compressibility and coef-
ﬁcient of thermal expansion. The parameters of elementary cells, depending on
geometry, stability and dynamics of primary eﬀectons are changing also. All
these predictions of our theory are in accordance with experimental data.

Consequently, theory propose a new clear mechanism of 1st and 2nd order
phase transitions. The number of molecules in the volume of primary eﬀec-
tons (5.11a) may be considered as a parameter of order for 1st order phase
transition.

5.5. The energy of quasiparticle discrete states.
Activation energy of dynamics in water

Over the entire temperature range for water and ice, excluding conditions
of 2nd order phase transitions, the energies of ”acoustic” a-states of primary
eﬀectons (translational and librational ones) are lower than the energies of ”op-
tic” b-states (Fig.9). The energy of an ideal eﬀecton (3RT) has the intermediate
values.

55

Fig. 9. Temperature dependences for the energy of primary
eﬀectons in ”acoustic” (a) and ”optical” (b) states and that for the
energy of a harmonic 3D oscillator (the ideal thermal eﬀecton: E0 =
3RT ) for water and ice calculated according to the formulae (4.6,
4.7 and 4.12): a) for primary translational eﬀectons of water in a
and b states; b) for primary librational eﬀectons of water in a and b
states; c) for primary translational eﬀectons of ice in a and b states;
d) for primary librational eﬀectons of ice in a and b states.

According to the eq.(4.10 and 4.11) the thermoaccessibility of (a) and (b)

states is determined by the absolute value of the diﬀerence:

| Ea

ef − 3kT |tr,lb;

| Eb

ef − 3kT |tr,lb .

where E0 = 3kT = 3hν0 is energy of an ideal eﬀecton.

The (a ⇔ b) transitions (quantum beats) can be considered as autooscil-
lations of quasiparticles around the thermal equilibrium state (E0), which is
quantum - mechanically prohibited. In terms of synergetics, the primary eﬀec-
tons are the medium active elements.

(b → a) transitions are related to origination of photons, and electromagnetic
deformons, while the reverse ones (a → b) correspond to absorption of them,
i.e. annihilation of deformons.

56

The nonequilibrium conditions in the subsystems of eﬀectons and deformons
can be induced by the competition between discrete quantum and continuous
heat energy distributions of diﬀerent quasiparticles. Sometimes these nonequi-
librium conditions could lead to macroscopic long-period oscillations in con-
densed matter.

thermal equilibrium energy.

M )tr,lb and that for macrodeformons (ǫM

The knowledge of the excitation energies of macrodeformons is important
for calculation the viscosity and coeﬃcient of self-diﬀusion (see sections 6.6 and
6.8).

The A and B states of macro- and supereﬀectons represent the signiﬁcant de-
viations from thermal equilibrium. The transitions between these states termed:
macro- and superdeformons represent the strong ﬂuctuations of polarizabilities
and, consequently, of refraction index and dielectric permeability.

The excitation energies of A and B states of macroeﬀectons are determined

as:

The value (ǫM
D )tr ≈ 11.7kJ/M ≈ 2.8 kcal/M characterizes the activation energy
for translational self-diﬀusion of water molecules, and (ǫM
D )lb ≈ 31kJ/M ≈ 7.4
kcal/M - the activation energy for librational self-diﬀusion of H2O. The latter
value is close to the energy of the hydrogen bond in water (Eisenberg, 1969).

On the other hand,the biggest ﬂuctuations-superdeformons are
responsible for the process of cavitational ﬂuctuations in liquids and
the emergency of defects in solids. They determine vapor pressure
and sublimation, as it will be shown in our work.

The relative distribution of frequencies on Fig.10 is the same as of energies
on Fig. 9. The values of these frequencies reﬂect the minimum life-times of
corresponding states. The real life-time is dependent also on probability of
”jump” from this state to another one and on probability of states excitation.

excitations

The set of formula, describing the dynamic properties of quasiparticles, in-

troduced in mesoscopic theory was presented earlier.

For the case of (a ⇔ b)1,2,3 transitions of primary and secondary eﬀectons
(tr and lb), their life-times in (a) and (b) states are the reciprocal value of
tr,lb . These parameters
corresponding frequencies:
and the resulting ones could be calculated from eqs.(2.27; 2.28) for primary
eﬀectons and (2.54; 2.55) for secondary ones.

[τa = 1/νa and τb = 1/νb]1,2,3

The results of calculations, using eq.(4.56 and 4.57) for frequency of excita-

tions of primary tr and lb eﬀectons are plotted on Fig. 11a,b.

The frequencies of Macroconvertons and Superdeformons were calculated

using eqs.(4.42 and 4.48).

(c) - Frequency of [lb/tr] Macroconvertons (ﬂickering clusters)

excitations, calculated from eq.(4.42);

(d) - Frequency of Superdeformons excitations, calculated from

eq.(4.48).

At the temperature interval (0 - 100)0C the frequencies of translational and

librational macrodeformons (tr and lb) are in the interval of

(1.3 − 2.8) · 109s−1 and (0.2 − 13) · 106s−1

(5.16)

correspondingly. The frequencies of (ac) and (bc) convertons could be deﬁned
also using our software and formulae, presented at the end of Section IV.

The frequency of primary translational eﬀectons [a ⇔ b] transitions at 200C,

calculated from eq.(4.56) is

ν ∼ 7 · 1010 (1/s)

(5.17)

It corresponds to electromagnetic wave length in water with refraction index
(n = 1.33) of:

λ = (cn)/ν ∼ 6mm

(5.18)

For the other hand, there are a lot of evidence, that irradiation of very diﬀerent
biological systems with such coherent electromagnetic ﬁeld exert great inﬂuences
on their properties (Grundler and Keilman, 1983).

59

Between the dynamics/function of proteins, membranes, etc. and
dynamics of their aqueous environment the strong interrelation exists.
The frequency of macroconvertons, representing big density ﬂuctuation in
the volume of primary librational eﬀecton at 370C is about 107(1/s) (Fig 11c),
the frequency of librational macrodeformons at the same temperature is about
106 s−1,i.e. coincides with frequency of large-scale protein cavities pulsa-
tions between open and closed to water states (see Fig.11). This conﬁrm
our hypothesis that the clusterphilic interaction is responsible for stabilization
of the proteins cavities open state and that transition from the open state to the
closed one is induced by coherent water cluster dissociation.

The frequency of Superdeformons excitation (Fig.11d) is much lower:

νs ∼ (104 − 105) s−1

(5.19)

Superdeformons are responsible for cavitational ﬂuctuations in liquids and orig-
ination of defects in solids. Dissociation of oligomeric proteins, like hemoglobin
or disassembly of actin and microtubules could be also related with such big
ﬂuctuations. Superdeformons could stimulate also the reversible dissociation of
water molecules, which determines the pH value

H2O ⇋ HO− + H +

(5.20)

Recombination of HO− and H + may be accompanied by emission of UV
and visible photons. Corresponding radiation could be responsible for fraction
of so-called biophotons.

The parameters, characterizing an average spatial distribution of
primary lb and tr eﬀectons in the bulk water are presented on the next
Fig.12.

cordance to eq.4.62);

(d) - the ratio of space between primary [tr] eﬀectons to their

One can see from the Fig.12 that the dimensions of primary translational
eﬀectons are much smaller and concentration much higher than that of primary
librational eﬀectons. We have to keep in mind that these are the averaged
spatial distributions of collective excitations. The formation of polyeﬀectons -
coherent clusters of lb (in liquids) and tr (in solids) primary eﬀectons, interacting
side-by-side due to Josephson eﬀect is possible also.

mary eﬀectons (translational and librational) in (a) and (b) states:

These dependences can be considered as the quasiparticles
distribution functions.

To get such information using conventional tools, i.e. by means of x-ray
or neutron scattering methods is very complicated task. However, even in this
case the ﬁnal information about properties of collective excitations will not be
so comprehensive as it leads from our theory.

The results, presented above, conﬁrms the correctness of our model
for liquids and solids, as a hierarchic system of 3D standing waves of
diﬀerent nature. It will be demonstrated below that application of
Hierarchic theory could be useful for elucidation and quantitative
analysis of very diﬀerent physical properties.

6. INTERRELATION BETWEEN MESOSCOPIC AND
MACROSCOPIC PARAMETERS OF MATTER

6.1. The state equation for real gas

The Clapeyrone-Mendeleyev equation sets the relationship between pressure
(P ), volume (V ) and temperature (T ) values for the ideal gas containing N0
molecules (one mole):

P V = N0kT = RT

(6.1)

In the real gases interactions between the molecules and their sizes should be
taken into account. It can be achieved by entering the corresponding amend-
ments into the left part, to the right or to the both parts of eq. (1).

It was Van der Waals who choosed the ﬁrst way more than a hundred years

ago and derived the equation:

P +

a
V 2

(cid:16)

(cid:17) (cid:0)

(cid:1)

V − b

= RT

(6.2)

where the attraction forces are accounted for by the amending term (a/V 2),
while the repulsion forces and the eﬀects of the excluded volume accounted for
the term (b).

Equation (2) correctly describes changes in P,V and T related to liquid-gas
transitions on the qualitative level. However, the quantitative analysis by means
of (2) is approximate and needs the ﬁtting parameters. The parameters (a) and
(b) are not constant for the given substance and depend on temperature. Hence,
the Van der Waals equation is only some approximation describing the state of
a real gas.

We propose a way to modify the right part of eq.(1), substituting it for the
part of the kinetic energy (T) of 1 mole of the substance (eq.4.31 in [1, 2]) in
real gas phase formed only by secondary eﬀectons and deformons with nonzero
impulse, aﬀecting the pressure:

The contribution to pressure caused by primary quasiparticles as Bose-condensate
with the zero resulting impulse is equal to zero also.

It is assumed when using such approach that for real gases the model of
a system of weakly interacted oscillator pairs is valid. The validity of such
an approach for water is conﬁrmed by available experimental data indicating
the presence of dimers, trimers and larger H2O clusters in the water vapor
(Eisenberg and Kauzmann, 1975).

Water vapor has an intensive band in oscillatory spectra at ˜ν = 200cm−1.
Possibly, it is this band that characterizes the frequencies of quantum beats
between ”acoustic” (a) and ”optic” (b) translational oscillations in pairs of
molecules and small clusters. The frequencies of librational collective modes
in vapor are absent.

The energies of primary gas quasiparticles (hνa and hνb) can be calculated

on the basis of the formulae used for a liquid (see section...).

However, to calculate the energies of secondary quasiparticles in (¯a) and
(¯b) states the Bose-Einstein distribution must be used for the case when the
temperature is higher than the Bose-condensation temperature (T > T0) and the
chemical potential is not equal to zero (µ < 0). According to this distribution:

¯Ea = h¯νa =

(cid:16)
The kinetic energies of eﬀectons (¯a)tr,lb and (¯b)tr,lb states are equal, only the

(cid:17)

potential energies diﬀer as in the case of condensed matter.

All other parameters in basic equation (6.3) can be calculated as previously

described.

6.2. New state equation for condensed matter

Using our eq.(4.3 from [1,2]) for the total internal energy of condensed matter

(Utot), we can present state equation in a more general form than (3).

For this end we introduce the notions of internal pressure (Pin), including all
type of interactions between particles of matter and excluded molar volume
(Vexc):

63

Vexc =

πα∗N0 = V0

n2 − 1
n2

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(6.5)

where α∗ is the acting polarizability of molecules in condensed matter (see
section...);

N0 is Avogadro number, and V0 is molar volume.
The general state equation can be expressed in the following form:

PtotVf r = (Pext + Pin)(V0 − Vexc) = Uef

(6.6)

where: Uef = Utot(1 + V /T t

kin) = U 2

tot/Tkin

is the eﬀective internal energy and:

(1 + V /Tkin) = Utot/Tkin = S−1

is the reciprocal value of the total structural factor (eq.2.46a of [1]); Ptot =
Pext + Pin is total pressure, Pext and Pin are external and internal pressures;
Vf r = V0 − Vexc = V0/n2 (see eq.5) is a free molar volume; Utot = V + Tkin is
the total internal energy, V and Tkin are total potential and kinetic energies of
one mole of matter.

For the limit case of ideal gas, when Pin = 0; Vexc = 0; and the potential
energy V = 0, we get from (6) the Clapeyrone - Mendeleyev equation (see 1):

PextV0 = Tkin = RT

One can use equation of state (6) for estimation of sum of all types of internal

matter interactions, which determines the internal pressure Pin:

Pin =

− Pext =

− Pext

(6.7)

Uef

tot
V0Tkin

where: the molar free volume: Vf r = V0 − Vexc = V0/n2;
and the eﬀective total energy: Uef = U 2
tot/Tkin = Utot/S.
For solids and most of liquids with a good approximation: Pin ≫ [Pext ∼ 1

atm. = 105P a]. Then from (7) we have:

Pin ∼=

(cid:18)

V
Tkin (cid:19)

(6.8)

where S = Tkin/Utot is a total structural factor; Tkin and V are total kinetic
and potential energies, respectively.

For example for 1 mole of water under standard conditions we obtain:
Vexc = 8.4cm3; Vf r = 9.6cm3; V0 = Vexc + Vf r = 18cm3;
Pin ∼= 380000 atm. = 3.8 · 1010P a (1 atm. =105P a).
The parameters such as sound velocity, molar volume, and the positions
of translational and librational bands in oscillatory spectra that determine
Uef (4.3) depend on external pressure and temperature.

64

The results of computer calculations of Pin (eq.7) for ice and water are

presented on Fig. 14 a,b.

Polarizability and, consequently, free volume (Vf r) and Pin in (6.6) depend

on energy of external electromagnetic ﬁelds.

(a) Theoretical temperature dependence of internal
pressure (Pin) in ice including the point of [ice ⇔ water] phase tran-
sition; (b) Theoretical temperature dependence of internal pressure
(Pin) in water. Computer calculations were performed using eq.
(6.7).

The minima of Pin(T ) for ice at −1400 and −500C in accordance with eq.(9)
correspond to the most stable structure of this matter, related to temperature
transition. In water some kind of transition appears at 350C, near physiological
temperature.

There may exist conditions when the derivatives of internal pressure Pin are

equal to zero:

(cid:18)

(6.9)

This condition corresponds to the minima of potential energy, i.e. to the
most stable structure of given matter. In a general case there may be a
few metastable states when conditions (6.9) are fulﬁlled.

Equation of state (6.7) may be useful for the study of mechanical properties

of condensed matter and their change under diﬀerent inﬂuences.

It seems that our equation of state (6.7) may be used to study diﬀerent
types of external inﬂuences (pressure, temperature, electromagnetic radiation,
deformation, etc.) on the thermodynamic and mechanic properties of solids and
liquids.

6.3. Vapor pressure

When a liquid is incubated long enough in a closed vessel at constant tem-

perature, then an equilibrium between the liquid and vapor is attained.

At this moment, the number of molecules evaporated and condensed back

to liquid is equal. The same is true of the process of sublimation.

There is still no satisfactory quantitative theory for vapor pressure calcula-

tion.

We can suggest such a theory using our notion of superdeformons, represent-
ing the biggest thermal ﬂuctuations (see Table 1 and Introduction). The basic
idea is that the external equilibrium vapor pressure is related to internal one
(P S
in) with coeﬃcient determined by the probability of cavitational ﬂuctuations
(superdeformons) in the surface layer of liquids or solids.

In other words due to excitation of superdeformons with probability (P S

D),
the internal pressure (P S
in) in surface layers, determined by the total contribu-
tions of all intramolecular interactions turns to external one - vapor pressure
(PV ). It is something like a compressed spring energy realization due to trigger
switching oﬀ.

67

For taking into account the diﬀerence between the surface and bulk internal
pressure (Pin) we introduce the semi-empirical surface pressure factor (qS) as:

in = qSPin − Pext = qS ·
P S

n2Utot
V0S

− Pext

where: Pin corresponds to eq.(7); S = Tkin/Utot is a total structure factor.

The value of surface factor (qS) for liquid and solid states is not the same:

for vapor pressure, resulting from evaporation or sublimation, the following
formulae:

68

We can assume, that the diﬀerence in the surface and bulk internal pressure
is determined mainly by diﬀerence in total internal energy (Utot) but not in
kinetic one (Tk). Then a pressure surface factor could be presented as:

qS = γ2 = (Uin/Utot)2

where: γ = U S

Theoretical calculated temperature dependences of vapor pressure, described

by (6.26) coincide very well with experimental ones for water at qS
1.76) and for ice at qS

sol = 18 (γs = 4.24) (Fig. 15).

The almost ﬁve-times diﬀerence between qS

sol and qS

liq means that the surface

properties of ice diﬀer from bulk ones much more than for liquid water.

The surface factors qS

liq and qS
sol should be considered as a ﬁt pa-
rameters. The qS = γ2
is the only one ﬁt parameter that was used
in our hierarchic mesoscopic theory. Its calculation from the known
vapor pressure or surface tension can give an important information
itself.

6.4. Surface tension

The resulting surface tension is introduced in our mesoscopic model as a

sum:

σ = (σtr + σlb)

(6.28)

where: σtr and σlb are translational and librational contributions to surface
tension. Each of these components can be expressed using our mesoscopic state
equation (6.7), taking into account the diﬀerence between surface and bulk total
energies (qS), introduced in previous section:

where (Vef )tr,lb are volumes of primary tr and lib eﬀectons, related to their
concentration (nef )tr,lb as:

is an eﬀective radius of the primary translational and librational eﬀectons, local-
ized on the surface of condensed matter; qS is the surface factor, equal to that
used in eq.(6.24 -6.26);
[Ptot = Pin + Pext] is a total pressure, corresponding to
eq.(6.6); (Pef )tr,lb is a total probability of primary eﬀecton excitations in the
(a) and (b) states:

(Vef )tr,lb = (1/nef )tr,lb;

where:

Using (6.30) and (6.29) the resulting surface tension (6.28) can be presented

as:

(Pef + Pt)tr + (Pef + Pt)lb + (Pcon + PcMt)

(6.31)

where translational component of surface tension is:

σtr = π

Ptot(qs − 1)(Pef )trltr
(Pef + Pt)tr + (Pef + Pt)lb + (Pcon + PcMt)

(6.32)

and librational component of σ is:

σlb = π

Ptot(qS − 1)(Pef )lbllb
(Pef + Pt)lb + (Pef + Pt)lb + (Pcon + PcMt)

(6.33)

Under the boiling condition when qS → 1 as a result of (U S

tot → Utot), then
σtr, σlb and σ tends to zero. The maximum depth of the surface layer, which
determines the σlb is equal to the length of edge of cube (llb), that approximates
the shape of primary librational eﬀectons. It decreases from about 20 ˚A at
00C till about 2.5 ˚A at 1000C (see Fig. 4b). Monotonic decrease of (llb) with
temperature could be accompanied by nonmonotonic change of probabilities of
[lb/tr] convertons and macroconvertons excitations (see comments to Fig 4a ).
Consequently, the temperature dependence of surface tension on temperature
can display anomalies at deﬁnite temperatures. This consequence of our theory
is conﬁrmed experimentally (Adamson, 1982; Drost-Hansen and Lin Singleton,
1992).

The thickness of layer (ltr), responsible for contribution of translational
eﬀectons in surface tension (σtr) has the dimension of one molecule in all tem-
perature interval for liquid water.

The results of computer calculations of σ (eq.6.31) for water and experimen-

tal data are presented at Fig.16.

) and theoretical (- - -) temperature

dependences of the surface tension for water, calculated from eq.(6.31).

It is obvious, that the correspondence between theory and experiment is
very good, conﬁrming in such a way the correctness of our model and Hierarchic
concept in general.

6.5. Mesoscopic theory of thermal conductivity

Thermal conductivity may be related to phonons, photons, free electrons,

holes and [electron-hole] pairs movement.

We will discuss here only the main type of thermal conductivity in condensed

matter, related to phonons.

The analogy with the known formula for thermal conductivity (κ) in the

framework of the kinetic theory for gas is used:

κ =

CvvsΛ

1
3

(6.34)

where Cv is the heat capacity of condensed matter, vs is sound velocity, charac-
terizing the speed of phonon propagation in matter, and Λ is the average length
of free run of phonons.

The value of Λ depends on the scattering and dissipation of phonons at
other phonons and diﬀerent types of defects. Usually decreasing temperature
increases Λ.

Diﬀerent factors inﬂuencing a thermal equilibrium in the system of phonons
are discussed. Among them are the so called U- and N- processes describing
the types of phonon-phonon interaction. However, the traditional theories are
unable to calculate Λ directly.

Mesoscopic theory introduce two contributions to thermal conductivity: re-
lated to phonons, irradiated by secondary eﬀectons and forming secondary

71

translational and librational deformons (κsd)tr,lb and to phonons, irradiated by
a and b convertons [tr/lb], forming the convertons-induced deformons (κcd)ac.bc:

where: free runs of secondary phonons (tr and lb) are represented as:

consequently:

1/(Λsd)tr,lb =

(6.36)

and free runs of convertons-induced phonons:

1/(Λcd)ac,bc = 1/(Λac) + 1/(Λbc) = (νac)/vs + (νbc)/vs

consequently: (Λsd)tr,lb =

The heat capacity: CV = ∂Utot/∂T can be calculated also from our theory (see
Chapter 4 and 5).

ity for water and contributions, related to acoustic deformons and
[lb/tr]convertons. The dependences were calculated, using eq. (37).

Quantitative calculations show that formula (6.35), based on our mesoscopic
model, works well for water (Fig. 17). It could be used for any other condensed
matter also if positions of translational and librational bands, sound velocity
and molar volume for this matter at the same temperature interval are known.
The small diﬀerence between experimental and theoretical data can reﬂect
the contributions of non-phonon process in thermal conductivity, related to
macrodeformons, superdeformons and macroconvertons, i.e. big ﬂuctuations.

6.6. Mesoscopic theory of viscosity for liquids and solids

The viscosity is determined by the energy dissipation as a result of medium
(liquid or solid) structure deformation. Viscosity corresponding to the shift
deformation is named shear viscosity. So- called bulk viscosity is related to
deformation of volume parameters and corresponding dissipation. These types
of viscosity have not the same values and nature.

The statistical theory of irreversible process leads to the following expression

for shear viscosity (Prokhorov, 1988):

η = nkT τp + (µ∞ − nkT )τq

(6.38)

where [n] is the concentration of particles, µ∞ is the modulus of instant shift
characterizing the instant elastic reaction of medium, τp and τq are the relaxation
times of impulses and coordinates, respectively.

However, eq.(38) is inconvenient for practical purposes due to diﬃculties in

determination of τp, τq and µ∞.

is working:

Sometimes in a narrow temperature interval the empirical Ondrade equation

η = A(T ) · exp(β/T )

(6.39)

A(T) is a function poorly dependent on temperature.

A good results in study the microviscosity problem were obtained by com-
bining the model of molecular rotational relaxation and the Kramers equation
(˚Akesson et al., 1991). However, the using of the ﬁt parameters was necessarily
in this case also.

We present here our mesoscopic theory of viscosity. To this end
the dissipation processes, related to (A ⇋ B)tr.lb cycles of translational and li-
brational macroeﬀectons and (a,b)-convertons excitations were used. The same
approach was employed for elaboration of mesoscopic theory of diﬀusion in con-
densed matter (see next section).

In contrast to liquid state, the viscosity of solids is determined by the biggest
ﬂuctuations: supereﬀectons and superdeformons, resulting from simultane-
ous excitations of translational and librational macroeﬀectons and macrodefor-
mons in the same volume.

The dissipation phenomena and ability of particles or molecules to diﬀusion
are related to the local ﬂuctuations of the free volume (∆vf )tr,lb. According to
mesoscopic theory, the ﬂuctuations of free volume and that of density occur in
the almost macroscopic volumes of translational and librational macrodeformons
and in mesoscopic volumes of macroconvertons, equal to volume of primary
librational eﬀecton at the given conditions. Translational and librational types
of macroeﬀectons determine two types of viscosity, i.e. translational (ηtr) and
librational (ηlb) ones. They can be attributed to the bulk viscosity. The con-
tribution to viscosity, determined by (a and b)- convertons is much more local
and may be responsible for microviscosity and mesoviscosity.

Let us start from calculation of the additional free volumes (∆vf ) originat-
ing from ﬂuctuations of density, accompanied the translational and librational
macrodeformons (macrotransitons).

73

For 1 mole of condensed matter the following ratio between free volume and

concentration ﬂuctuations is true:

∆vf
vf (cid:19)tr,lb
where N0 is the average number of molecules in 1 mole of matter

∆N0

Taking into account the dimensions of viscosity and its physical sense, it
should be proportional to the work (activation energy) of ﬂuctuation-dissipation,
necessary for creating the unit of additional free volume: (EM
f ), and the
period of (A ⇋ B)tr.lb cycles of translational and librational macroeﬀectons
τA⇋B, determined by the life-times of all intermediate states (eq.46).

D /∆v0

In turn, the energy of dissipation should be strongly dependent
on the structural factor (S): the ratio of kinetic energy of matter to
its total internal energy. We postulate here that this dependence for
viscosity is cubical: (Tk/Utot)3 = S3.

Consequently, the contributions of translational and librational macrodefor-

mons to resulting viscosity we present in the following way:

Using (6.47, 6.46 and 6.44) it is possible to calculate the contributions of

arately, using (6.45).

Characteristic life-times for ac-convertons and bc-convertons [tr/lb] in the

as:

τac = (τa)tr + (τa)lb = (1/νa)tr + (1/νa)lb
τbc = (τb)tr + (τb)lb = (1/νb)tr + (1/νb)lb

The averaged contribution of the both types of convertons in viscosity is:

ηc = (ηac ηbc)1/2

This contribution could be responsible for microviscosity or better term: meso-
viscosity, related to volumes, equal to that of primary librational eﬀectons.

The resulting viscosity (Fig.18) is a sum of the averaged contributions of

macrodeformons and convertons:

η = ηM + ηc

Fig. 18. Theoretical and experimental temperature dependences
of viscosities for water. Computer calculations were performed using
eqs. (6.44 - 6.53) and (4.3; 4.36).

The best correlation between theoretical and experimental data was achieved
after assuming that only (π/2 = 2π/4) part of the period of above described
ﬂuctuation cycles is important for dissipation and viscosity. Introducing this

76

factor to equations for viscosity calculations gives up very good correspondence
between theory and experiment in all temperature interval (0-1000C) for water
(Fig.18).

ﬂuctuations [ τ

As will be shown below the same factor, introducing the eﬀective time of
π/2 ], leads to best results for self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient calculation.
In the classical hydrodynamic theory the sound absorption coeﬃcient (α)

obtained by Stokes includes share (η) and bulk (ηb) averaged microviscosity:

Bulk viscosity (ηb) is usually calculated from the experimental η and α. It

is known that for water:

(ηb/η) ∼ 3.

The viscosity of solids

In accordance with our model, the biggest ﬂuctuations: supereﬀectons and
superdeformons (see Introduction) are responsible for viscosity and diﬀusion
phenomena in solid state. Superdeformons are accompanied by the emergency
of cavitational ﬂuctuations in liquids and the defects in solids. The presentation
of viscosity formula in solids (ηs) is similar to that for liquids:

(6.56a)

The viscosity of ice, calculated from eq.(6.55) is bigger than that of water
(eq.6.53) to about 105 times. This result is in accordance with available ex-
perimental data.

tion is for translational motion of particle:

If we take the angle ¯ϕ2 = 1/3 in (6.59), then the corresponding rotational
correlation time comes to the form of the known Stokes- Einstein equation:

All these formulas (6.57 - 6.60) include macroscopic share viscosity (η) corre-
sponding to our (6.53). In terms of our model, the Brownian movement is a
consequence of macrodeformons and convertons. Putting our formula (6.53)
for viscosity of liquid into (6.57 - 6.59), we get the possibility of quantitative
analysis of corresponding parameters, using our computer program.

6.8. Self-diﬀusion in liquids and solids

Molecular theory of self-diﬀusion, as well as general concept of transfer phe-
nomena in condensed matter is extremely important, but still unresolved prob-
lem.

Simple semi-empirical approach developed by Frenkel leads to following ex-

pression for diﬀusion coeﬃcient in liquid and solid:

D =

exp(−W/kT )

(6.61)

a2
τ0

where [a] is the distance of ﬂuctuation jump; τ0 ∼ (10−12 ÷ 10−13) s is the
average period of molecule oscillations between jumps; W - activation energy of
jump.

The parameters: a, τ0 and W should be considered as a ﬁt parameters.
In accordance with mesoscopic theory, the process of self-diﬀusion in
liquids, like that of viscosity, described above, is determined by two contribu-
tions:

78

a) the collective, nonlocal contribution, related to translational and

librational macrodeformons (Dtr,lb);

b) the local contribution, related to coherent clusters ﬂickering: [dissocia-
tion/association] of primary librational eﬀectons (a and b)- convertons (Dac,bc).
Each component of the resulting coeﬃcient of self-diﬀusion (D) in liquid
could be presented as the ratio of ﬂuctuation volume cross-section surface:
f ]2/3 to the period of macroﬂuctuation (τ ). The ﬁrst contribution to co-
[∆v0

The averaged component of self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which takes into ac-
count both types of nonlocal ﬂuctuations, related to translational and librational
macroeﬀectons and macrodeformons, can be ﬁnd as:

The formulae for the second, local contribution to self-diﬀusion in
liquids, related to (a and b) convertons (Dac,bc) are symmetrical by form to
that, presented above for nonlocal processes:

account both types of convertons (ac and bc) is:

DC = [(D)ac (D)bc]1/2

(6.67)

79

(6.62)

(6.63)

tons (DMc):

τMc

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(6.67a)

where: PMc = Pac · Pbc is a probability of macroconvertons excitation;
the life-time of macroconvertons is:

τMc = (τac τbc)1/2

(6.67b)

The cycle-period of (ac) and (bc) convertons are determined by the sum of
life-times of intermediate states of primary translational and librational eﬀec-
tons:

τac = (τa)tr + (τa)lb;

and

τbc = (τb)tr + (τb)lb

(6.67c)

The life-times of primary and secondary eﬀectons (lb and tr) in a- and b-

states are the reciprocal values of corresponding state frequencies:

[τa = 1/νa; τa = 1/νa; and τb = 1/νb; τ b = 1/νb]tr,lb

(6.67d)

[νa and νb]tr,lb correspond to eqs. 4.8 and 4.9; [νa and νb]tr,lb could be calculated
using eqs.2.54 and 2.55.

The resulting coeﬃcient of self-diﬀusion in liquids (D) is a sum of nonlocal

(DM ) and local (Dc, DMc) eﬀects contributions (see eqs.6.64 and 6.67):

D = DM + Dc + DMc

(6.68)

The eﬀective ﬂuctuation-times were taken the same as in previous section for
viscosity calculation, using the correction factor [(π/2) τ ].

Fig. 19. Theoretical and experimental temperature dependences
of self-diﬀusion coeﬃcients in water. Theoretical coeﬃcient was cal-
culated using eq. 6.68.

Like in the cases of thermal conductivity, viscosity and vapor pressure, the
results of theoretical calculations of self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient coincide well with
experimental data for water (Fig. 19) in temperature interval (0 − 1000C).

The self-diﬀusion in solids

In solid state only the biggest ﬂuctuations: superdeformons, representing
simultaneous excitation of translational and librational macrodeformons in the
same volumes of matter are responsible for diﬀusion and the viscosity phenom-
ena. They are related to origination and migration of the defects in solids. The
formal presentation of superdeformons contribution to self-diﬀusion in solids
(Ds) is similar to that of macrodeformons for liquids:

where: reduced ﬂuctuating free volume in composition of superdeformons

Characteristic cycle-period of supereﬀectons is related to that of tr and lb

macroeﬀectons like it was presented in eq.(6.56a):

τs = τA∗ + τB∗ + τD∗

(6.71)

The self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient for ice, calculated from eq.6.69 is less than that
of water (eq.6.53) to about 105 times. This result is in accordance with available
experimental data.

Strong decreasing of D in a course of phase transition: [water → ice] pre-
dicted by our mesoscopic theory also is in accordance with experiment (Fig.
20).

81

Fig. 20. Theoretical temperature dependences of self-

diﬀusion coeﬃcients in ice.

All these results allow to consider our hierarchic theory of transfer phe-
nomena as a quantitatively conﬁrmed one. They point that the ”mesoscopic
bridge” between Micro- and Macro Worlds is wide and reliable indeed. It gives
a new possibilities for understanding and detailed description of very diﬀerent
phenomena in solids and liquids.

One of the advantages of our theory of viscosity and diﬀusion
is the possibility of explaining numerous nonmonotonic temperature
changes, registered by a number of physicochemical methods in var-
ious aqueous systems during the study of temperature dependences
(Drost-Hansen, 1976; 1992; Johri and Roberts, 1990; Aksnes, Asaad,
1989; Aksnes, Libnau, 1991; Kaivarainen, 1985; Kaivarainen et al.,
1993).

Lot of them are related to diﬀusion or viscosity processes and may be ex-
plained by nonmonotonic changes of the refraction index, included in our equa-
tions: (6.44, 6.45, 6.50) for viscosity and eqs.
(6.69, 6.70) for self-diﬀusion.
For water these temperature anomalies of refraction index were revealed experi-
mentally, using few wave lengths in the temperature interval 3 − 950 (Frontasev,
Schreiber, 1966). They are close to Drost-Hansen temperatures. The explana-
tion of these eﬀects, related to periodic variation of primary librational eﬀectons
stability with monotonic temperature change was presented as a comments to
Fig.4a.

Another consequence of our theory is the elucidation of a big diﬀerence be-
tween librational ηlb (6.48), translational ηtr (6.45) viscosities and mesoviscosity,
determined by [lb/tr] convertons (6.49 and 6.52).

The eﬀect of mesoviscosity can be checked as long as the volume of a Brow-
nian particle does not exceed much the volume of primary librational eﬀectons

82

(eq. 6.15). If we take a Brownian particle, much bigger than the librational pri-
mary eﬀecton, then its motion will reﬂect only averaged share viscosity (eq.6.53).
The third consequence of the mesoscopic theory of viscosity is the prediction
of nonmonotonic temperature behavior of the sound absorption coeﬃcient α
(6.51). Its temperature dependence must have anomalies in the same regions,
where the refraction index has.

The experimentally revealed temperature anomalies of (n) also follow from
our theory as a result of nonmonotonic (a ⇔ b)lb equilibrium behavior, stabil-
ity of primary lb eﬀectons and probability of [lb/tr] convertons excitation (see
Discussion to Fig.4a ).

Our model predicts also that in the course of transition from the laminar
type of ﬂow to the turbulent one the share viscosity (η) will increases due to
increasing of structural factor (Tk/Utot) in eq. 6.45.

The superﬂuidity (η → 0) in the liquid helium could be a result of inabil-
ity of this liquid at the very low temperature for translational and librational
macroeﬀectons excitations, i.e. τ M → 0.

In turn, it is a consequence of tending to zero the life-times of secondary
eﬀectons and deformons in eq.(6.45), responsible for dissipation processes, due
to their Bose-condensation and transformation to primary ones (Kaivarainen
1998). The polyeﬀectons, stabilized by Josephson’s junctions between primary
eﬀectons form the superﬂuid component of liquid helium.

7. Osmose and solvent activity.
Traditional and mesoscopic approach

It was shown by Van’t Hoﬀ in 1887 that osmotic pressure (Π) in the dilute

concentration of solute (c) follows a simple expression:

Π = RTc

(7.1)

This formula can be obtained from an equilibrium condition between a solvent
and an ideal solution after saturation of diﬀusion process of the solvent through
a semipermeable membrane:

µ0

1(P ) = µ1(P + Π, Xi)

where µ0
1 and µ1 are the chemical potentials of a pure solvent and a solvent in
solution; P - external pressure; Π - osmotic pressure; X1 is the solvent fraction
in solution.

At equilibrium dµ0

Although the osmotic eﬀects are widespread in Nature and are very impor-
tant, especially in biology, the physical mechanism of osmose remains unclear
(Watterson, 1992).

The explanation following from Van’t Hoﬀ equation (7.7) and pointing that
osmotic pressure is equal to that induced by solute molecules, if they are consid-
ered as an ideal gas in the same volume at a given temperature is not satisfactory.
The osmoses phenomenon can be explained quantitatively on the
basis of our mesoscopic theory and state equation (see 6.6 and 6.7).
To this end, we have to introduce the rules of conservation of the
main internal parameters of solvent in the presence of guest (solute)
molecules or particles:

1. Internal pressure of solvent: Pin = const
2. The total energy of solvent: Utot = const

(7.11)

(cid:27)

This conservation rules can be considered as the consequence of Le Chatelier
principle.

Using (6.6), we have for the pure solvent and the solvent perturbed by a

solute the following two equations, respectively:

or using (7.17):

The ratio:

is generally known as a structural factor.

We can see from (7.19) and (7.20) that osmotic pressure is proportional to
the diﬀerence between total kinetic energy of a free solvent (Tk) and that of the
solvent perturbed by guest molecules:

∆Tk = Tk − T 1
k

or related diﬀerence between the total potential energy of perturbed and pure
solvent:

∆V = V1 − V where: ∆Tk = ∆V ≡ Dif (see Fig. 21).

pressure (7.20) in blood at the constant value of Dif = 6.7 · 10−3(J/M ), corre-
sponding on Fig. 21 to physiological temperature (370).

The ratios of this Dif value to total potential (V) and total kinetic energy

(Tk) of pure water at 370(see Fig. 21) are equal to:

(Dif/V ) ≃

6.7 · 10−3
3.5 · 102

∼= 5 · 10−7 and

∼= 2 · 10−5

i.e. the relative changes of the solvent potential and kinetic energies are very
small.

performed using eqs. (7.19) or (7.20).

For each type of concentrated macromolecular solutions the optimum amount
of water is needed to minimize the potential energy of the system determined
mainly by clusterphilic interactions. The conservation rules (7.11) and self-
organization in solutions of macromolecules (clustron formation) may be respon-
sible for the driving force of osmose in the diﬀerent compartments of biological
cells.

Comparing (7.20) and (7.10) and assuming equality of the molar volumes
V0 = ¯V1, we ﬁnd a relation between the diﬀerence in potential energies and
chemical potentials (∆µ) of unperturbed solvent and that perturbed by the
solute:

It is obvious, the application of Hierarchic theory to solvent activ-
ity evaluation might be of practical importance for diﬀerent processes
in chemical and colloid technology.

8. New approach to theory of light refraction
8.1. Refraction in gas

If the action of photons onto electrons of molecules is considered as a force,
activating a harmonic oscillator with decay, it leads to the known classical equa-
tions for a complex refraction index (Vuks, 1984).

The Lorentz-Lorenz formula obtained in such a way is convenient for prac-
tical needs. However, it does not describe the dependence of refraction index
on the incident light frequency and did not take into account the intermolecular
interactions. In the new theory proposed below we have tried to clear up the
relationship between these parameters.

Our basic idea is that the dielectric penetrability of matter ǫ, (equal in the
optical interval of frequencies to the refraction index squared n2), is determined
by the ratio of partial volume energies of photon in vacuum to similar volume
energy of photon in matter:

ǫ = n2 =

[E0
p ]
[Em
p ]

=

mpc2
mpc2
m

=

c2
c2
m

(8.1)

where mp = hνp/c2 is the eﬀective photon mass, c is the light velocity in

vacuum, cm is the eﬀective light velocity in matter.

We introduce the notion of partial volume energy of a photon
in vacuum [E0
p ] as a product of photon energy
(Ep = hνp) and the volume (Vp) occupied by 3D standing wave of
photon in vacuum and in matter, correspondingly:

p] and in matter [Em

[E0

p ] = EpV 0
p

[Em

p ] = EpV m
p

(8.2)

The 3D standing photon volume as an interception volume of 3 diﬀerent
standing photons normal to each other was termed in our mesoscopic model as
a primary electromagnetic deformon (see Introduction).

In vacuum, where the eﬀect of an excluded volume due to the spatial incom-
patibility of electron shells of molecules and photon is absent, the volume of 3D
photon standing wave (primary deformon) is:

V 0
p =

1
np

3λ2
p

90

(8.3)

We will consider the interaction of light with matter in this mesoscopic volume,
containing a thousands of molecules of condensed matter. It is the reason why
we titled this theory of light refraction as mesoscopic one.

Putting (8.3) into (8.2), we obtain the formula for the partial volume energy

of a photon in vacuum:

[E0

p ] = EpV 0

p = hνp

9λ2
p

(8.4)

Then we proceed from the assumption that waves B of photons can not
exist with waves B of electrons, forming the shells of atoms and molecules in
the same space elements. Hence, the eﬀect of excluded volume appears during
It
the propagation of an external electromagnetic wave through the matter.
leads to the fact that in matter the volume occupied by a photon, is equal to

for the case when the external electromagnetic ﬁelds as well as intermolecular
interactions inducing the additional polarization are absent. This situation is
realized at Ep = hνp → 0 and λp → ∞ in the gas phase. As will be shown
below the value of resulting α∗ in condensed matter is bigger.

8.2. Light refraction in liquids and solids

According to the Lorentz classical theory, the electric component of the outer
electromagnetic ﬁeld is ampliﬁed by the additional inner ﬁeld (Ead), related to
the interaction of induced dipole moments in composition of condensed matter
with each other:

Ead =

n2 − 1

(8.15)

The mean Lorentz acting ﬁeld ¯F can be expressed as:

F = E + Ead =

(8.16)

¯F - has a dimensions of electric ﬁeld tension and tends to E in the gas phase

when n → 1.

n2 + 2

92

In accordance with our model, beside the Lorentz acting ﬁeld, the total
internal acting ﬁeld, includes also two another contributions, increasing the
molecules polarizability (α) in condensed matter:

1. Potential intermolecular ﬁeld, including all the types of Van- der-Waals
interactions in composition of coherent collective excitations, even without ex-
ternal electromagnetic ﬁeld. Like total potential energy of matter, this contri-
bution must be dependent on temperature and pressure;

2. Primary internal ﬁeld, related with primary electromagnetic deformons
(tr and lb). This component of the total acting ﬁeld also exist without external
ﬁelds. Its frequencies corresponds to IR range and its action is much weaker
than the action of the external visible light.

Let us try to estimate the energy of the total acting ﬁeld and its eﬀective

frequency (νf ) and wavelength (λf ), that we introduce as:

Af = hνf =

= AL + AV + AD

(8.17)

hc
λf

where: AL, AV and AD are contributions, related with Lorentz ﬁeld, po-

tential ﬁeld and primary deformons ﬁeld correspondingly.

When the interaction energy of the molecule with a photon (Ep = hνp)
is less than the energy of the resonance absorption, then it leads to elastic
polarization of the electron shell and origination of secondary photons, i.e. light
scattering. We assume in our consideration that the increment of polarization of
a molecule (α) under the action of the external photon (hνp) and the total active
ﬁeld (Af = hνf ) can be expressed through the increase of the most probable
radius of the electron’s shell (Le = α1/3), using our (eq. 7.6 from [Kaivarainen,
1995, 2000]):

∆Le =

ωp me
2~ α

where the resulting increment:

∆L∗ = ∆Le + ∆Lf =

(hνp + Af )me
2~2

α

where: α = L3

e is the average polarizability of molecule in gas phase at νf →

0.

For water molecule in the gas phase:

Le = α1/3 = 1.13 · 10−10 m

is a known constant, determined experimentally [4].

The total increment of polarizability radius (∆L∗) and resulting polarizabil-
ity of molecules (α∗) in composition of condensed matter aﬀected by the acting
ﬁeld

α∗ = (L∗)3

(8.18b)

can be ﬁnd from the experimental refraction index (n) using our formula (8.14):

in the

from (8.18) we get a formula for the increment of radius of polarizability (∆Lf ),
induced by the total internal acting ﬁeld:

∆Lf = ∆L∗ − ∆Le =

Af me
2~2 α

Like total internal acting ﬁeld energy (8.17), this total acting increment
can be presented as a sum of contributions, related to Lorentz ﬁeld (∆LF ),
potential ﬁeld (∆LV ) and primary deformons ﬁeld (∆LD):

∆Lf = ∆LL + ∆LV + ∆LD

(8.22)

Increment ∆Le, induced by external photon only, can be calculated from the
known frequency (νp) of the incident light (see 8.18a):

∆Le =

hνp me
2~2 α

It means that ∆Lf can be found from (8.21) and (8.17), using (8.23). Then
from (8.21) we can calculate the energy (Af ), eﬀective frequency (νf ) and wave
length (λf ) of the total acting ﬁeld like:

Af = hνf = hc/λf = 2

∆Lf ~2
meα

The computer calculations of α∗; L∗ = Le + ∆L∗ = (α∗)1/3 and Af
temperature range (0 − 950) are presented on Fig.24.

One must keep in mind that in general case α and L are tensors. It means
that all the increments, calculated on the base of eq.(8.18a) must be considered
as the eﬀective ones. Nevertheless, it is obvious that our approach to analysis
of the acting ﬁeld parameters can give useful additional information about the
properties of transparent condensed matter.

Fig. 24. (a)- Temperature dependencies of the most probable
outer electron shell radius of H2O (L∗) and the eﬀective polarizabil-
ity α∗ = (L∗)3 in the total acting ﬁeld (eq. 8.19);

(b)- Temperature dependence of the total acting ﬁeld (Af ) en-
ergy (8.24) in water at the wavelength of the incident light λp =
5.461 · 10−5cm−1. The experimental data for refraction index n(t)
were used in calculations. The initial electron shell radius is: Le =
α1/3
H2O = 1.13 · 10−8cm.
In graphical calculations in Fig.24a, the
used experimental temperature dependence of the water refraction
index were obtained by Frontas’ev and Schreiber (1966).

The temperature dependencies of these parameters were computed using the
known experimental data on refraction index n(t) for water and presented in
Fig.24a. The radius L∗ in the range 0 − 950C increases less than by 1% at
constant incident light wavelength (λ = 546.1nm). The change of ∆Lf with
temperature is determined by its potential ﬁeld component change ∆LV .

The relative change of this component: ∆∆LV /∆Lf (t = 00C) is about
9%. Corresponding to this change the increasing of the acting ﬁeld energy
Af (eq.8.23) increases approximately by 8 kJ/M (Fig 8.1 b) due to its potential
ﬁeld contribution.

It is important that the total potential energy of water in the same tempera-
ture range, according to our calculations, increase by the same magnitude (Fig.
3b). This fact points to the strong correlation between potential intermolecular
interaction in matter and the value of the acting ﬁeld energy.

It was calculated that, at constant temperature (200) the energy of the acting
ﬁeld (Af ), (eq.8.23) in water practically does not depend on the wavelength of
incident light (λp). At more than three time alterations of λp:
from 12.56 ·
10−5cm to 3.03 · 10−5cm when the water refraction index (n) changes from
1.320999 to 1.358100 (Kikoin, 1976), the value of Af changes less than by 1%.
At the same conditions the electron shell radius L∗ and the acting polar-
izability α∗ thereby increase from (1.45 to 1.5)·10−10 m and from (3.05 to
3.274) · 10−30m3 respectively (Fig.25). These changes are due to the incident
photons action only. For water molecules in the gas phase and λp → ∞ the
e) is equal to 1.44 · 10−24cm3 (Eisenberg, Kauz-
initial polarizability (α = L3
mann,1969), i.e. signiﬁcantly less than in condensed matter under the action of
external and internal ﬁelds.

Obviously, the temperature change of energy Af (Fig.24b) is determined by
the internal pressure increasing (section ..), related to intermolecular interaction
change, depending on mean distances between molecules and, hence, on the
concentration (N0/V0) of molecules in condensed matter.

95

Fig. 25. Dependencies of the acting polarizability α∗ = (L∗)3
and electron shell radius of water in the acting ﬁeld (L∗) on incident
light wavelength (λp), calculated from eq. (8.14) and experimental
data n(λp) (Kikoin, 1976). The initial polarizability of H2O in the
e = 1.44 · 10−24cm3. The
gas phase at λp → ∞ is equal to α = L3
corresponding initial radius of the H2O electron shell is Le = 1.13 ·
10−8cm.

On the basis of our data, changes of Af , calculated from (8.24) are caused
mainly by the heat expansion of the matter. The photon induced increment of
the polarizability (α → α∗) practically do not change Af .

The ability to obtain new valuable information about changes of molecule po-
larizability under the action of incident light and about temperature dependent
molecular interaction in condensed medium markedly reinforce such a widely
used method as refractometry.

The above deﬁned relationship between the molecule polarizability and the
wave length of the incident light allows to make a new endeavor to solve the
light scattering problems.

9. Mesoscopic theory of Brillouin light scattering in condensed
matter

9.1. Traditional approach

According to traditional concept, light scattering in liquids and crystals as
well as in gases takes place due to random heat ﬂuctuations. In condensed media
the ﬂuctuations of density, temperature and molecule orientation are possible.
Density (ρ) ﬂuctuations leading to dielectric penetrability (ǫ) ﬂuctuations
are of major importance. This contribution is estimated by means of Einstein
formula for scattering coeﬃcient of liquids:

mental data:

(9.2)

9.2. Fine structure of scattering

The ﬁne structure - spectrum of the scattering in liquids is represented by
two Brillouin components with frequencies shifted relatively from the incident
light frequency: ν± = ν0 ± ∆ν and one unshifted band like in gases (ν0).

The shift of the Brillouin components is caused by the Doppler eﬀect result-
ing from a fraction of photons scattering on phonons moving at sound speed in
two opposite directions.

This shift can be explained in diﬀerent way as well (Vuks, 1977). If in the
antinodes of the standing wave the density oscillation occurs at frequency (Ω):

ρ = ρ0 cos Ωt,

(9.3)

then the scattered wave amplitude will change at the same frequency. Such a
wave can be represented as a superposition of two monochromatic waves having
the frequencies:(ω + Ω) and (ω − Ω), where

Ω = 2πf

is the elastic wave frequency at which scattering occurs when the Wolf-Bragg
condition is satisﬁed:

that observed in gases, is caused by entropy ﬂuctuations in liquids, without any
changes of pressure (Vuks, 1977). On the basis of Frenkel theory of liquid state,
the central line can be explained by ﬂuctuations of ”hole” number - cavitational
ﬂuctuations (Theiner, 1969).

The thermodynamic approach of Landau and Plachek leads to the formula,
which relates the intensities of the central (I) and two lateral (IM−B) lines of
the scattering spectrum with compressibility and heat capacities:

I
2IM−B

=

Ip
Iad

=

βT − βS
βS

=

Cp − Cv
Cv

(9.10)

where: βT and βS are isothermal and adiabatic compressibilities; Cp and Cv
are isobaric and isohoric heat capacities.

In crystals, quartz for example, the central line in the ﬁne structure of light
scattering is usually absent or very small. However, instead of one pair of shifted
components, observed in liquids, there appear three Brillouin components in
crystals. One of them used to be explained by scattering on the longitudinal
phonons, and two - by scattering on the transversal phonons.

9.3. New mesoscopic approach to problem

In follows from our hierarchic theory that the thermal ”random” ﬂuctuations

are ”organized” by diﬀerent types of superimposed quantum excitations.

According to our Hierarchic model, including microscopic, mesoscopic and
macroscopic scales of matter (see Introduction), the most probable (primary)
and mean (secondary) eﬀectons, translational and librational are capable of
quantum transitions between two discreet states: (a ⇔ b)tr,lb and (¯a ⇔ ¯b)tr,lb
respectively. These transitions lead to origination/annihilation of photons and
phonons, forming primary and secondary deformons.

The mean heat energy of molecules is determined by the value of 3kT, which
as our calculations show, has the intermediate value between the discreet en-
ergies of a and b quantum states of primary eﬀectons (Fig...), making, con-
sequently, the non-equilibrium conditions in condensed matter. Such kind of
instability is a result of ”competition” between classical and quantum distribu-
tions of energy .

98

The maximum deviations from thermal equilibrium and that of the dielec-
tric properties of matter occur when the same states of primary and secondary
quasiparticles, e.g. a,¯a and b,¯b occur simultaneously. Such a situation corre-
sponds to the A and B states of macroeﬀectons. The (A ⇔ B)tr,lb transitions
represent thermal ﬂuctuations. The big density ﬂuctuations are related to ”ﬂick-
ering clusters” (macroconvertons between librational and translational primary
eﬀectons) and the maximum ﬂuctuations correspond to Superdeformons.

Only in the case of spatially independent ﬂuctuations the inter-
ference of secondary scattered photons does not lead to their total
compensation.

The probability of the event that two spatially uncorrelated events coincide

in time is equal to the product of their independent probabilities.

Thus, the probabilities of the coherent (a,¯a) and (b,¯b) states of primary and
secondary eﬀectons, corresponding to A and B states of the macroeﬀectons (tr
and lb), independent on each other, are equal to:

molecules when ∆ = 0, the Cabanne factor is equal to 1.

In the case of isotropic

The depolarization coeﬃcient (∆) could be determined experimentally as

the ratio:

∆ = Ix/Iz,

(9.26)

where Ix and Iz are two polarized components of the beam scattered at right
angle with respect to each other in which the electric vector is directed parallel
and perpendicular to the incident beam, respectively. For example, in water
∆ = 0.09 (Vuks, 1977).

According to the proposed theory of light scattering in liquids the central un-
shifted (like in gases) component of the Brillouin scattering spectrum, is caused
by ﬂuctuations of concentration and self-diﬀusion of molecules, participating in
the convertons, macrodeformons (tr and lib) and superdeformons. The scatter-
ing coeﬃcients of the central line (Rcentr) and side lines (2Rside) in transparent
condensed matter, as follows from (9.24) and (9.25), are equal correspondingly
to:

Rt = Rcent + 2Rside

(9.28)

In accordance with our model the ﬂuctuations of anisotropy (Cabanne factor)
should be taken into account for calculations of the central component only. The
orientations of molecules in composition of A and B states of Macroeﬀectons are
correlated and their coherent oscillations are not accompanied by ﬂuctuations
of anisotropy of polarizability (see Fig.26).

The probabilities of the convertons, macrodeformons and superdeformons
excitations in crystals are much lower than in liquids and hence, the central line
in the Brillouin spectra of crystals is not usually observed.

The lateral lines in Brillouin spectra are caused by the scattering on the
molecules forming (A) and (B) states of spatially independent macroeﬀectons,
as it was mentioned above.

The polarizabilities of the molecules forming the independent macroeﬀec-
tons, synchronized in (A)tr,lb and (B)tr,lb states and dielectric properties of
these states, diﬀer from each other and from that of transition states (macrode-
formons). Such short-living states should be considered as the non equilibrium
ones.

102

In fact we must keep in mind, that static polarizabilities in the more stable
ground A state of the macroeﬀectons are higher than in B state, because the
energy of long-term Van der Waals interaction between molecules of the A state
is bigger than that of B-state.

If this diﬀerence may be attributed mainly to the diﬀerence in the long-therm

dispersion interaction, then from (8.33) we obtain:

The kinetic energy and dimensions of ”acoustic” and ”optic” states of macroef-

In our present calculations of light scattering we ignore this diﬀerence (9.29)

between polarizabilities of molecules in A and B states.

But it can be taken into account if we assume, that polarizabilities in (A)

and (a), (B) and (b) states of primary eﬀectons are like:

αA ≃ αa ≃ α∗; αB ≃ αb

and the diﬀerence between the potential energy of (a) and (b) states is deter-
mined mainly by dispersion interaction (eq.9.28).

Experimental resulting polarizability (α∗ ≃ αa) can be expressed as:

αa = faαa + fbαb + ftα

(9.29a)

where αt ≃ α is polarizability of molecules in the gas state (or transition state);

fa =

αb = αa − ∆αa = αa(1 − νp/νb)

where: ∆αa is a change of each molecule polarizability as a result of the
primary eﬀecton energy changing: Eb → Ea + hνp with photon radiation; νb is
a frequency of primary eﬀecton in (b)- state (eq.9.28).

Combining (9.29) and (9.29b) we derive for αa and αb of the molecules

The ratio of intensities or scattering coeﬃcients for the central component
to the lateral ones previously was described by Landau- Plachek formula (9.10).
According to our mesoscopic theory this ratio can be calculated in another way
leading from (9.27) and (9.28):

scattering.

The known equation for Brillouin shift is (see 9.7):

∆νM−B = ν0 = 2

(9.31)

vs
λ

where: vs is the hypersonic velocity; λ is the wavelength of incident light, n is
the refraction index of matter, and θ - scattering angle.

The deviation from ν0 that determines the Brillouin side line half width may
be expressed as the result of ﬂuctuations of sound velocity vs and n related to
A and B states of tr and lib macroeﬀectons:

∆ν0 is the most probable side line width, i.e. the true half width of Brillouin

line. It can be expressed as:

104

∆ν0 = ∆νexp − F ∆νinc

where ∆νexp is the half width of the experimental line, ∆νinc - the half width of
the incident line, F - the coeﬃcient that takes into account apparatus eﬀects.

Let us analyze the ﬁrst and the second terms in the right part of (9.32)

The traditional theory of Brillouin line shape gives a possibility for calculation

The fading out of acoustic wave amplitude may be expressed as:

A = A0e−αx

or A = A0e−αvs

(9.45)

where α is the extinction coeﬃcient; x = vst - the distance from the source of
waves; vs and t - sound velocity and time, correspondingly.

The hydrodynamic theory of sound propagation in liquids leads to the fol-

lowing expression for the extinction coeﬃcient:

α = αs + αb =

ηs + ηb

where: αs and αb are contributions to α, related to share viscosity (ηs) and
bulk viscosity (ηb), respectively; Ω = 2πf is the angular frequency of acoustic
waves.

When the side lines in Brillouin spectra broaden slightly, the following rela-
tion between their intensity (I) and shift (∆ω =| ω − ω0 |) from frequency ω0,
corresponding to maximum intensity (I = I0) of side line is correct:

where:

One can see from (9.46) that at I(ω) = I0/2, the half width:

and ∆ν1/2 =

It will be shown in Chapter 12 how one can calculate the values of ηs and
consequently αs on the basis of the mesoscopic theory of viscosity.

9.5. Quantitative veriﬁcation of hierarchic theory of
Brillouin scattering

The calculations made according to the formula (9.21 - 9.27) are presented in
Fig.26-28. The proposed theory of scattering in liquids, based on our hierarchic
concept, is more adequate than the traditional Einstein, Brillouin, Landau-
Plachek theories based on classical thermodynamics. It describes experimen-
tal temperature dependencies and the Icentr/2IM−B ratio for water very well
(Fig.28).

The calculations are made for the wavelength of incident light: λph =
546.1nm = 5.461 · 10−5cm. The experimental temperature dependence for
the refraction index (n) at this wavelength was taken from the Frontas’ev and
Schreiber paper (1965). The rest of data for calculating of various light scat-
tering parameters of water (density the location of translational and librational
bands in the oscillatory spectra) are identical to those used above in Chapter 6.

From formula (9.48a) the resulting or eﬀective molecular polarizability

squared (α∗)2 used in eq.(9.21-9.23) is:

On the other hand, from the Lorentz-Lorenz formula (9.49) we have another
value of polarizability:

It is evident that the light scattering coeﬃcients (eq.9.28), calculated using
(9.50) and (9.51) taking refraction index: n = 1.33 should diﬀer more than four
times as far:

At 250 and λph = 546nm the theoretical magnitude of the scattering
coeﬃcient for water, calculated from our formulae (9.28) is equal (see Fig.26)
to:

R = 11.2 · 10−5m−1

(9.53)

This result of our theory coincides well with the most reliable experimental value
(Vuks, 1977):

Rexp = 10.8 · 10−5m−1

Multiplication of the side bands contribution (2Rside) to Cabanne factor in-
creases the calculated total scattering to about 25% and makes the correspon-
dence with experiment worse. This fact conﬁrms our assumption that ﬂuctua-
tions of anisotropy of polarizability in composition of A and B states of macroef-
fectons should be ignored in light scattering evaluation due to correlation of
molecular dynamics in these states, in contrast to that of macrodeformons.

tions of A and B states of translational Macroeﬀectons to the total
scattering coeﬃcient of water (see also Fig.27);

Fig. 30. Theoretical temperature dependencies of the contri-
butions of the A and B states of librational Macroeﬀectons to the
coeﬃcient of light scattering (R).

It follows from the Fig.29 and Fig.30 that the light scattering depends on
(A ⇔ B) equilibrium of macroeﬀectons because (RA) > (RB), i.e. scattering
on A states is bigger than that on B states.

Fig. 31. Theoretical temperature dependencies of the contribu-
tions to light scattering (central component), related to translational
(RD)tr and librational (RD)lb macrodeformons.

Comparing Figs. 26; 28, and 31 one can see that the main contribution to
central component of light scattering is determined by [lb/tr] convertons Rc (see
eq.9.27).

111

Fig. 32. Theoretical temperature dependences for temperature
derivative (dR/dT ) of the total coeﬃcient of light scattering of water.

Nonmonotonic deviations of the dependencies dR/dT (Fig.32) reﬂect the
nonmonotonic changes of the refraction index for water nH2O(T ), as indicated
by available experimental data (Frontas’ev and Schreiber, 1965). The deviations
of dependence nH2O(t) from the monotonic way in accordance with hierarchic
theory, are a consequence of the nonmonotonic change in the stability of water
structure, i.e. nonlinear change of (A ⇔ B)tr,lb equilibrium. Some possible
reasons of such equilibrium change were discussed in Chapter 6.

It is clear from (9.52) that the calculations based on the Lorentz-Lorentz
formula (9.51) give scattering coeﬃcient values of about 4.5 times smaller than
experimental ones. It means that the true α∗ value can be calculated only on
the basis of our mesoscopic theory of light refraction (eq.9.50).

The traditional Smolukhovsky-Einstein theory, valid for the integral light
scattering only (eq. 9.1), yield values in the range of R = 8.85 · 10−5 m−1 to
R = 10.5 · 10−5 m−1 (Eisenberg, Kauzmann, 1969; Vuks, 1977).

The results, discussed above, demonstrate that new theory of light
scattering works better and is more informative than the conventional
one.

9.6. Light scattering in solutions

If the guest molecules are dissolved in a liquid and their sizes are much less
than incident light wavelength, they do not radically alter the solvent properties.
For this case the described above mechanism of light scattering of pure liquids
does not changed qualitatively.

For such dilute solutions the scattering on the ﬂuctuations of concentration
of dissolved molecules (Rc) is simply added to the scattering on the density
ﬂuctuations of molecules of the host solvent (eq.9.28). Taking into account the
ﬂuctuations of molecule polarizability anisotropy (see 9.25) the total scattering
coeﬃcient of the solution (RS) is:

112

RS = Rt + Rc

(9.54)

Eqs. (9.21 - 9.28) could be used for calculating Rt until critical concentra-
tions (Ccr) of dissolved substance when it start to destroy the solvent structure,
so that the latter is no longer able to form primary librational eﬀectons. Pertur-
bations of solvent structure will induce low-frequency shift of librational bands
in the oscillatory spectrum of the solution until these bands totally disappear.
If the experiment is made with a two-component solution of liquids, soluble
in each other, e.g. water-alcohol, benzol-methanol etc., and the positions of
translational and librational bands of solution components are diﬀerent, then
at the concentration of the dissolved substance: C > Ccr, the dissolved sub-
stance and the solvent (the guest and host) can switch their roles. Then the
translational and librational bands pertinent to the guest subsystem start to
dominate. In this case, Rt is to be calculated from the positions of the new
bands corresponding to the ”new” host-solvent. The total ”melting” of the pri-
mary librational ”host eﬀectons” and the appearance of the dissolved substance
”guest eﬀectons” is like the second order phase transition and should be accom-
panied by a heat capacity jump. The like experimental eﬀects take place indeed
(Vuks, 1997).

According to our concept, the coeﬃcient Rc in eq.(9.54) is caused by the ﬂuc-
tuations of concentration of dissolved molecules in the volume of translational
and librational macro- and superdeformons of the solvent. If the destabilization
of the solvent is expressed in the low frequency shift of librational bands,
then the coeﬃcients (RA and RB)lb increase (eq.9.21 and 9.22) with the prob-
ability of macro-excitations.. The probabilities of convertons and macro- and
superdeformons and the central component of Brillouin spectra will increase
also. Therefore, the intensity of the total light scattering increases correspond-
ingly.

The ﬂuctuations of concentration of the solute molecules, in accordance with
our model, occur in the volumes of macrodeformons and superdeformons. Con-
sequently, the contribution of solute molecules in scattering (Rc value in eq.9.54)
can be expressed by formula, similar to (9.23), but containing the molecule po-
g)2 instead of the
larizability of the dissolved substance (”guest”), equal to (α∗
molecule polarizability (α∗) of the solvent (”host”), and the molecular con-
centration of the ”guest” substance in the solution (ng) instead of the solvent
molecule concentration (nM = N0/V0). For this case Rc could be presented as
a sum of the following contributions:

(Rc)tr,lb =

(9.54) is equal to:

113

Rc = (Rc)tr + (Rc)lb + RD
c

∗

(9.56)

If a few substances are dissolved with concentrations lower than (Ccr), then

their Rc are summed up additively.

Formulae (9.55) and (9.56) are valid also for the dilute solutions.
Eqs.(9.21-9.28) and (9.54-9.56) should, therefore, be used for calculating the

resulting coeﬃcient of light scattering in solutions (RS).

The traditional theory represents the scattering coeﬃcient at ﬂuctuations of

concentration as (Vuks, 1977):

where (∂ǫ/∂x) is the dielectric penetrability derivative with respect to one of
the components: ∆¯x2 is the ﬂuctuations of concentration of guest molecules
squared in the volume element v .

(cid:19)

1977) leads to the formula:

For application the mesoscopic theory of light scattering to study of crystals,

liquids and solutions, the following information is needed:

1. Positions of translational and librational band maxima in oscillatory spec-

tra;

2. Concentration of all types of molecules in solutions;
3. Refraction index or polarizability in the acting ﬁeld of each component of

solution at given temperature.

Application of our theory to quantitative analysis of transparent liquids and
solids yields much more information about properties of matter, its mesoscopic
and hierarchic dynamic structure than the traditional one.

10. Hierarchic theory of M¨ossbauer eﬀect

10.1. General background

When the atomic nucleus with mass (M) in the gas phase irradiates γ-

quantum with energy of

E0 = hν0 = mpc2

(10.1)

where: mp is the eﬀective photon mass, then according to the law of impulse
conservation, the nuclear acquires additional velocity in the opposite direction:

The corresponding additional kinetic energy

v = −

E0
M c

ER =

M v2
2

=

E2

2M c2

is termed recoil energy.

When an atom which irradiates γ-quantum is in composition of the solid

body, then three situations are possible:

1. The recoil energy of the atom is higher than the energy of atom - lattice
interaction. In this case, the atom irradiating γ-quantum would be knocked out
from its position in the lattice. That leads to defects origination;

2. Recoil energy is insuﬃcient for the appreciable displacement of an atom
in the structure of the lattice, but is higher than the energy of phonon, equal
to energy of secondary transitons and phonons excitation. In this case, recoil
energy is spent for heating the lattice;

3. Recoil energy is lower than the energy of primary transitons, related to
[emission/absorption] of IR translational and librational photons (hνp)tr,lb and
phonons (hνph)tr,lb. In that case, the probability (f) of γ-quantum irradiation
without any the losses of energy appears, termed the probability (fraction) of a
recoilless processes.

For example, when ER << hνph (νph - the mean frequency of phonons),

then the mean energy of recoil:

Hence, the probability of recoilless eﬀect is

(10.2)

(10.3)

(10.4)

(10.5)

According to eq.(10.3) the decrease of the recoil energy ER of an atom in the
structure of the lattice is related to increase of its eﬀective mass (M ). In our
model M corresponds to the mass of the eﬀecton.

ER = (1 − f )hνph

f = 1 −

115

The eﬀect of γ-quantum irradiation without recoil was discovered by M¨ossbauer

in 1957 and named after him. The value of M¨ossbauer eﬀect is determined by
the value of f ≤ 1.

The big recoil energy may be transferred to the lattice by portions that
are resonant to the frequency of IR photons (tr and lb) and phonons. The
possibility of stimulation of superradiation of IR quanta as a result
of such recoil process is a consequence of our model.

The scattering of γ-quanta without lattice excitation, when ER << hνph, is
termed the elastic one. The general expression (Wertheim, 1964; Shpinel, 1969)
for the probability of such phononless elastic γ-quantum radiation acts is equal
to:

where λ0 = c/ν0 is the real wavelength of γ-quantum; <x2 > - the nucleus
oscillations mean amplitude squared in the direction of γ-quantum irradiation.

The γ-quanta wavelength parameter may be introduced like:

where: L0 = 1.37 · 10−5cm for F e57, then eq.(10.6) could be written as follows:

f = exp

It may be shown (Shpinel, 1969), proceeding from the model of crystal as a
system of 3N identical quantum oscillators, that when temperature (T) is much
lower than the Debye one (θD) then:

10.2. Probability of elastic eﬀects

Mean square displacements <x2 > of an atoms or molecules in condensed
matter (eq. 10.8) is not related to excitation of thermal photons or phonons
(i.e. primary or secondary transitons). According to our concept, < x2 > is
caused by the mobility of the atoms forming eﬀectons and diﬀers for primary
and secondary translational and librational eﬀectons in (a, ¯a)tr,lb and (b, b)tr,lb
states.

We will ignore below the contributions of macro- and supereﬀectons in
M¨ossbauer eﬀect as very small. Then the resulting probability of elastic eﬀects
at γ-quantum radiation is determined by the sum of the following contributions:

In accordance with mesoscopic theory, the wave B length, impulses and group
velocities in a and b states of the eﬀectons are equal. Similarly to (10.23), we
obtain the group velocities of particles, composing secondary eﬀectons:

Substituting eqs.(10.23) and (10.24) into (10.18-10.21), we ﬁnd the important
expressions for the average coherent displacements of particles squared as a
result of their oscillations in the volume of the eﬀectons (tr, lib) in both discreet

Substituting eqs.(10.29) and (10.30) into (10.13), we ﬁnd the total probabil-

ity of recoilless eﬀects (ftot) in the given substance. Corresponding computer
calculations for ice and water are presented on Figs.33 and 34.

As far the second order phase transitions in general case are accompanied
by the alterations of the sound velocity and the positions of translational and
librational bands, they should also be accompanied by alterations of ftot and its
components.

perature of [ice ⇔ water] phase transition.

The total probability (f ) and its components, caused by primary and sec-
ondary quasiparticles were calculated according to formula (10.13). The value of
(f ) determines the magnitude of the M¨ossbauer eﬀect registered by γ-resonance
spectroscopy.

The band width caused by recoilless eﬀects is determined by the uncertainty

principle and expressed as follows:

Γ =

τ

10−27
1.4 · 10−7 = 7.14 · 10−21 erg = 4.4 · 10−9eV

(10.31)

where τ is the lifetime of nucleus in excited state (for F e57 τ = 1.4 · 10−7s).

The position of the band depends on the mean square velocity of atoms, i.e.
on second order Doppler eﬀect. In the experiment, such an eﬀect is compen-
sated by the velocity of γ-quanta source motion relative to absorbent. In the
framework of our model this velocity is interrelated with the mean velocity of
the secondary eﬀectons diﬀusion in condensed matter.

10.3. Doppler broadening in spectra of nuclear gamma-resonance
(NGR)

M¨ossbauer eﬀect is characterized by the unbroadened component of NGR

spectra only, with probability of observation determined by eq.(10.13).

When the energy of absorbed γ-quanta exceeds the energy of thermal IR pho-
tons (tr,lib) or phonons excitation, the absorbance band broadens as a result of
Doppler eﬀect. Within the framework of our mesoscopic concept the Doppler
broadening is caused by thermal displacements of the particles during [a ⇔ b
and ¯a ⇔ ¯b]tr,lb transitions of primary and secondary eﬀectons, leading to orig-
ination/annihilation of the corresponding type of deformons (electromagnetic
and acoustic).

121

The ﬂickering clusters: [lb/tr] convertons (a and b), can contribute in the

NGR line broadening also.

In that case, the value of Doppler broadening (∆Γ) of the band in the NGR
spectrum could be estimated from corresponding kinetic energies of these ex-
citations, related to their group velocities (see eq. 4.31). In our consideration
we take into account the reduced to one molecule kinetic energies of pri-
mary and secondary translational and librational transitons, a-convertons and
b-convertons. The contributions of macroconvertons, macro- and superdefor-
mons are much smaller due to their small probability and concentration:

lated to the corresponding total energies of these excitations (Et and ¯Et), their

The broadening of NGR spectral lines by Doppler eﬀect in liquids is generally
expressed using the diﬀusion coeﬃcient (D) at the assumption that the motion
of M¨ossbauer atom has the character of unlimited diﬀusion (Singvi, 1962):

where: E0 = hν0 is the energy of gamma quanta; c is light velocity and

where: η is viscosity, (a) is the eﬀective Stokes radius of the atom F e57

The probability of recoilless γ-quantum absorption by the matter containing
for example Fe57, decreases due to diﬀusion and corresponding Doppler broad-
ening of band (∆Γ):

where ∆Γ corresponds to eq.(10.32).The formulae obtained here make it possible
to experimentally verify a set of consequences of our mesoscopic theory using the
gamma- resonance method. A more detailed interpretation of the data obtained
by this method also becomes possible.

The magnitude of (∆Γ) was calculated according to formula (10.32).
It
corresponds well to experimentally determined Doppler widening in the nuclear
gamma resonance (NGR) spectra of ice.

dynamics of molecules and ions. Vibro-Gravitational interaction.

During the period of particles thermal oscillations (tr and lb), their in-
stant velocity, acceleration and corresponding forces alternatively and strongly
change.

The change of wave B instant group velocity, averaged during the molecule

From (10.40) one can express the accelerations of particles in the primary eﬀec-
tons of condensed matter, using their phase velocities as a waves B:

The accelerations of particles in composition of secondary eﬀectons have a sim-
ilar form:

These parameters are important for understanding the dynamic properties of
condensed systems. The accelerations of the atoms, forming primary and sec-
ondary eﬀectons can be calculated, using eqs.(3.35; 3.36) to determine phase
velocities and eqs. (3.5; 3.6 and 3.16; 3.17) to ﬁnd a frequencies.

The comparison of calculated accelerations with empirical data of the M¨ossbauer

According to eq.(3.5) in the low temperature range, when hνa << kT , the
frequency of secondary tr and lb eﬀectons in the (a) state can be estimated as:

νa =

(10.44)

For example, at T = 200K we have ¯νa ≈ 4 · 1012s−1.

(cid:1)

If the phase velocity in eq.(10.42) is taken equal to ¯va

ph = 2.1 · 105cm/s and

the mass of water molecule:

m = 18 · 1.66 · 10−24g = 2.98 · 10−23g,

then from (10.42) we get the acceleration of molecules in composition of sec-
ondary eﬀectons of ice in (a) state:

¯aa
gr =

h(¯νa)2
m¯va
ph

= 1.6 · 1016cm/s2

(10.45)

This value is about 1013 times more than that of free fall acceleration (g =
9.8 · 102cm/s2), which agrees well with experimental data, obtained for solid
bodies (Wertheim, 1964).

Accelerations of H2O molecules in composition of primary librational eﬀec-
gr) in the ice at 200K and in water at 300K are equal to: 0.6 · 1013cm/s2
tons (aa
and 2 · 1015cm/s2, correspondingly. They also exceed to many orders the
free fall acceleration.

It was shown experimentally (Sherwin, 1960), that heating of solid body
leads to decreasing of gamma-quanta frequency (red Doppler shift) i.e. increas-
ing of corresponding quantum transitions period. This can be explained as the
relativist time-pace decreasing due to elevation of average thermal velocity of
atoms.

The thermal vibrations of particles (atoms, molecules) in composition of
primary eﬀectons as a partial Bose-condensate are coherent. The increasing
of such clusters dimensions, determined by most probable wave B length, as
a result of cooling, pressure elevation or under magnetic ﬁeld action leads to
enhancement of coherent regions.

Each coherently vibrating cluster of particles with big alternating
accelerations, like librational and translational eﬀectons is a source of
coherent gravitational waves.

125

The frequency of these vibro-gravitational waves (VGW) is equal to fre-
quency of particles vibrations (i.e. frequency of the eﬀectons in a or b states).
The amplitude of VGW (AG) is proportional to the number of vibrating coher-
ently particles (NG) in composition of primary eﬀectons:

AG ∼ NG ∼ Vef /(V0/N0) = (1/nef )/(V0/N0)

(10.46)

The resonant long-distance gravitational interaction between coherent clusters
of the same body or between that of diﬀerent bodies is possible. The formal
description of this vibro-gravitational interaction (VGI) could be like that of
distant macroscopic Van der Waals interaction.

Diﬀerent patterns of virtual Bose-condensate of standing gravitational waves
in vacuum represent the vibro-gravitational replica (VGR) of condensed matter.
Important role of proposed here distant resonant VIBRO - GRAV-
ITATIONAL INTERACTION (VGI) in elementary acts of perception
and memory can be provided by coherent primary librational water
eﬀectons in microtubules of the nerve cells (see article: ”Hierarchic
Model of Consciousness” by Kaivarainen, 2000).

11. ENTROPY-INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OF MATTER,
SLOW RELAXATION, MACROSCOPIC OSCILLATIONS.
AND EFFECTS OF MAGNETIC FIELD

11.1. Theoretical background

One of the consequences of our concept is of special interest. It is the possibil-
ity for oscillation processes in solids and liquids. The law of energy conservation
is not violated thereupon because the energies of two quasiparticle subsystems
related to eﬀectons and deformons, can change in opposite phases. The total
internal energy of matter keeps almost constant.

The equilibrium shift between subsystems of condensed matter can be in-
duced by any external factor, i.e. pressure or ﬁeld. The relaxation time, neces-
sary for system to restore its equilibrium, corresponding to minimum of potential
or free energy after switching oﬀ external factor can be termed ”memory” of
system.

The energy redistribution between primary and secondary eﬀecton and de-
formon subsystems may have a periodical character, coupled with the oscillation
of the (a ⇔ b) equilibrium constant of primary eﬀectons (Ka⇔b) and correlated
oscillations of primary electromagnetic deformons concentration if dissipation
processes are weak or reversible. According to our model (Table 1) the (a → b)
transition of primary eﬀecton is related to photon absorption, i.e. a decrease
in primary electromagnetic deformon concentration, while the (b → a) transi-
¯a ⇔ ¯b
tion on the contrary, radiate photons.
equilibriums are shifted right ward, and equilibrium constants Ka⇔b and ¯Ka⇔b
(cid:3)
decreases, then concentrations of primary and secondary deformons (nd and ¯nd)
also decreases. If Ka⇔b grows up, i.e. the concentration of primary eﬀectons
in a-states increases, then nd increases. We remind that (a) and (b) states of
the primary eﬀectons correspond to the more and less stable molecular clusters

If, therefore, the [a ⇔ b] and

(cid:2)

(see Introduction). In accordance with our model, the strong interrelation exists
between dynamic equilibrium of primary and secondary eﬀectons. Equilibrium
of primary eﬀectons is more sensitive to any perturbations. However, the equi-
librium shift of secondary eﬀectons aﬀect the total internal energy, the entropy
change and possible mass defect (see below) stronger than that of primary ef-
fectons.

As we have shown (Fig. 29, 30), the scattering ability of A-states is more
than two times as high as that of B-states. Their polarizability, refraction index
It makes possible to register the
and dielectric permeability are also higher.
oscillations in the condensed matter in diﬀerent ways.

In accordance with our theory the oscillation of refraction index must induce
the corresponding changes of viscosity and self-diﬀusion in condensed matter.
The diﬀusion variations are possible, for example, in solutions of macromolecules
or other Brownian particles. In such a way self-organization in space and time
gradually may originate in appropriate solvents, solutions, colloid systems and
even in solid bodies.

The period and amplitude of these oscillations depend on the times of relax-
ation processes which are related to the activation energy of equilibrium shifts
in the eﬀectons, polyeﬀectons or coherent superclusters of primary eﬀectons
subsystems.

The reorganizations in the subsystems of translational and librational ef-
fectons, macro- and supereﬀectons, as well as chain-like polyeﬀectons, whose
stabilities and sizes diﬀer from each other, must go on at diﬀerent rates.
It
should, therefore, be expected that in the experiment the presence of several os-
cillation processes would be revealed. These processes are interrelated but going
with diﬀerent periods and amplitudes. Concomitant oscillations of self-diﬀusion
rate also must be taken into account. In such a way Prigogin’s dissipative struc-
tures could be developed (Prigogin, 1984). Instability in the degree of ordering
in time and space is accompanied by the slow oscillation of entropy of the whole
macroscopic system.

The coherent extraterrestrial cosmic factors and gravitational instabilities
can induce long relaxation and oscillation processes in water and other kind of
condensed matter (Udaltsova, et. al., 1987).

11.2. The entropy - information content of matter as a hierarchic
system

The statistical weigh for macrosystem (P), equal to number of
microstates (W), corresponding to given macrostate, necessary for
entropy calculation could be presented as:

W =

N !
N1! · N2! · . . . · Nq!

(11.1)

where:

is the total number of molecules in macrosystem;

N = N1 + N2 + ...Nq

(11.2)

127

Ni is the number of molecules in the i-th state;
q is the number of independent states of all quasiparticles in macrosys-

tem.

We can subdivide macroscopic volume of 1cm3 into 24 types of quasiparticles

in accordance with our hierarchic model (see Table 1).

In turn, each type of the eﬀectons (primary, secondary, macro- and super-
eﬀectons) is subdivided on two states: ground (a,A) and excited (b,B) states.
Taking into account two ways of the eﬀectons origination - due to thermal trans-
lations (tr) and librations (lb), excitations, related to [lb/tr] convertons, macro-
and super deformons, the total number of independent states is 24 also. It is
equal to number of independent relative probabilities of excitations, composing
partition function Z (see eq.4.2 ). Consequently, we have:

The number of molecules, in the unit of volume of condensed matter (1cm3),
participating in each of 24 excitation states (i) can be calculated as:

q = 24

Ni =

(v)i
V0/N0

· ni ·

=

Z

N0

(11.3)

where: (v)i = 1/ni is the volume of (i) quasiparticle, equal to reciprocal value
of its concentration (ni); N0 and V0 are Avogadro number and molar volume,
correspondingly; Z is partition function and Pi are relative probabilities of in-
dependent excitations in composition of Z (eq.4.2).

The total number of molecules of (i)-type of excitation in any big volume of

matter (VMac) is equal to

N i

Mac = NiVMac = VMac

N0
V0

Pi
Z

(11.3a)

Now we can calculate the statistical weight and entropy from eqs.(11.1 and
11.4).

For large values of Ni it is convenient to use a Stirling formula:

Ni = (2πN )1/2(N/e)N · exp(Θ/12N ) ∼ (2πN )1/2(N/Θ)N

(11.3b)

Using this formula and (11.1), one can obtain the following expression for en-

tropy:

S = k · ln W = −k ·

(Ni +

) ln Ni + const = S1 + S2 + ...Si

(11.4)

From this eq. we can see that the temperature increasing or [solid → liquid]
phase transition will lead to the entropy elevation:

q

i
X

2

∆S = SL − SS = k · ln(WL/WS) > 0

(11.5)

128

It follows from (11.4) and (11.3) that under conditions when (Pi) and Ni un-

dergoes oscillations it can lead to oscillations of contributions of diﬀerent types
of quasiparticles to the entropy of system and even to oscillations of total en-
tropy of system as an additive parameter. The coherent oscillations of Pi and
Ni can be induced by diﬀerent external ﬁelds: acoustic, electromagnetic and
gravitational. Macroscopic autooscillations may arise spontaneously also in the
sensitive and highly cooperative systems.

Experimental evidence for such phenomena will be discussed in the next

section.

The notions of probability of given microstate (pi = 1/W ), entropy (Si)
and information (Ii) are strongly interrelated. The smaller the probability the
greater is information (Nicolis 1986):

Ii = lg2

= − lg2 pi = lg2 Wi

(11.6)

p i

where pi is deﬁned from the Boltzmann distribution as:

pi =

exp(−Ei/kT )
∞
m=0 exp(−nmhνi/kT )

(11.7)

where nm is quantum number; h is the Plank constant; Ei = hνi is the energy
of (i)-state.

P

There is strict relation between the entropy and information, leading from

comparison of (11.6), (11.1 and 11.4):

Si = (kB ln 2)Ii = 2.3 · 10−24Ii

(11.8)

The information entropy is given as expectation of the information in the system
(Nicolis,1986; Haken, 1988).

< I >= ΣPi lg2(1/pi) = −Σpi lg2(pi)

(11.9)

From (26) and (22) we can see that variation of probability pi and/or Ni in (20)
will lead to changes of entropy and information, characterizing the matter as a
hierarchical system.

The reduced information (entropy), characterizing its quality, related
to selected collective excitation of any type of condensed matter, we introduce
here as a product of corresponding component of information [Ii] to the number
of molecules (atoms) with similar dynamic properties in composition of this
excitation:

qi = (vi/vm) = N0/(V0ni)

(11.9a)

where: vi = 1/ni is the volume of quasiparticle, reversible to its concentration
(ni); vm = V0/N0 is the volume, occupied by one molecule.

129

The product of (11.9) and (11.9a), i.e. the reduced information gives the
quantitative characteristic not only about quantity but also about the quality
of the information:

(Iq)i = pi lg 2(1/pi) · N0/(V0ni)

(11.9b)

This new formula could be considered as a useful modiﬁcation of known Shennon
equation.

11.3. Experimentally revealed macroscopic oscillations

A series of experiments was conducted in our laboratory to study macro-
scopically coherent oscillations in the buﬀer (pH 7.3) containing 0.15 M NaCl as
a control system and immunoglobulin G solutions in this buﬀer at the following
concentrations: 3 · 10−3; 6 · 10−3; 1.2 · 10−2 and 2.4 · 10−2mg/ml.

The turbidity (D∗) of water and the solutions were measured every 10 sec-
onds with the spectrophotometer at λ = 350nm. Data were obtained automat-
ically with the time constant 5 s during 40 minutes. The number of D∗ values
in every series was usually equal to 256. The total number of the fulﬁlled series
was more than 30.

The time series of D∗ were processed by the software for time series analysis.
The time trend was thus subtracted and the autocovariance function and the
spectral density were calculated.

The empty quartz cuvette with the optical path about 1 cm were used as a

base control.

Only the optical density of water and water dissolved substances, which
really exceeded background optical density in the control series were taken into
account. It is shown that the noise of the photoelectronic multiplier does not
contribute markedly to dispersion of D∗.

The measurements were made at temperatures of 17, 28, 32, and 370. The
period of the trustworthily registered oscillation processes related to changes
in D∗, had 2 to 4 discrete values over the range of (30 − 600) sec under our
conditions. It does not exclude the fact that the autooscillations of longer or
shorter periods exist. For example, in distilled water at 320C the oscillations
of the scattering ability are characterized by periods of 30, 120 and 600 s and
the spectral density amplitudes 14, 38 and 78 (in relative units), respectively.
With an increase in the oscillation period their amplitude also increases. At
280C the periods of the values 30, 41 and 92 seconds see have the corresponding
normalized amplitudes 14.7, 10.6 and 12.0.

Autooscillations in the buﬀer solution at 280C in a 1 cm wide cuvette with
the optical way length 1 cm (i.e. square section) are characterized with periods:
34, 52, 110 and 240 s and the amplitudes: 24, 33, 27 and 33 relative units. In
the cuvette with a smaller (0.5 cm) or larger (5 cm) optical wavelength at the
same width (1 cm) the periods of oscillations in the buﬀer change insigniﬁcantly.
However, amplitudes decreased by 50% in the 5 cm cuvette and by 10-20% in the
0.5 cm-cuvette. This points to the role of geometry of space where oscillations
occur, and to the existence of the ﬁnite correlation radius of the synchronous
processes in the volume. But this radius is macroscopic and comparable with
the size of the cuvette.

130

The dependence of the autooscillations amplitude on the concentration of
the protein - immunoglobulin G has a sharp maximum at the concentration of
1.2 · 10−2 mg/ml. There is a background for considering it to be a manifesta-
tion of the hydrodynamic Bjorkness forces between the pulsing macromolecules
(K¨aiv¨ar¨ainen, 1987).

Oscillations in water and water solutions with nearly the same periods have

been registered by the light-scattering method by Chernikov (1985).

Chernikov (1990d) has studied the dependence of light scattering ﬂuctua-
tions on temperature , mechanic perturbation and magnetic ﬁeld in water and
water hemoglobin and DNA solution. It has been shown that an increase in
temperature results in the decline of long-term oscillation amplitude and in the
increase of short-time ﬂuctuation amplitude. Mechanical mixing removes long-
term ﬂuctuations and over 10 hours are spent for their recovery. Regular ﬂuc-
tuations (oscillations) appear when the constant magnetic ﬁeld above 240A/m
is applied; the ﬂuctuations are retained for many hours after removing the ﬁeld.
The period of long-term oscillations has the order of 10 minutes. It has been
assumed that the maintenance of long-range correlation of molecular rotation-
translation ﬂuctuation underlies the mechanism of long-term light scattering
ﬂuctuations.

It has been shown (Chernikov, 1990b) that a pulsed magnetic ﬁeld (MF), like
constant MF, gives rise to light scattering oscillations in water and other liquids
containing H atoms: glycerin, xylol, ethanol, a mixture of unsaturated lipids.
All this liquids also have a distinct response to the constant MF. ”Spontaneous”
and MF-induced ﬂuctuations are shown to be associated with the isotropic com-
ponent of scattering. These phenomena do not occur in the nonproton liquid
(carbon tetrachloride) and are present to a certain extent in chloroform (con-
taining one hydrogen atom in its molecule). The facts obtained indicate an
important role of hydrogen atoms and cooperative system of hydrogen bonds in
”spontaneous” and induced by external perturbations macroscopic oscillations.
The understanding of such phenomena can provide a physical basis for of
self-organization (Prigogin, 1980, 1984, Babloyantz, 1986), the biological sys-
tem evolution (Shnol, 1979, Udaltsova et al., 1987), and chemical processes
oscillations (Field and Burger, 1988).

It is quite probable that macroscopic oscillation processes in biological liq-
uids, e.g. blood and liquor, caused by the properties of water are involved in
animal and human physiological processes.

We have registered the oscillations of water activity in the protein-cell system
by means of light microscopy using the apparatus ”Morphoquant”, through the
change of the erythrocyte sizes, the erythrocytes being ATP-exhausted and
fulﬁlling a role of the passive osmotic units. The revealed oscillations have a
few minute-order periods.

Preliminary data obtained from the analysis of oscillation processes in the
human cerebrospinal liquor indicate their dependence on some pathology. Per-
haps, the autooscillations spectrum of the liquor can serve as a sensitive test
for the physiological status of the organism. The liquor is an electrolyte and
its autooscillations can be modulated with the electromagnetic activity of the
brain.

The activity of the central nervous system and the biological rhythms

of the organism may be dependent on the oscillation processes in the
liquor. If it is the case, then the directed inﬂuence on these autooscil-

131

lation processes, for example, by means of external electromagnetic
ﬁeld of resonant frequency makes it possible to regulate the state of
the organism. Such way of correction of biorhythms could be simple
and eﬀective.

During my stay in laboratory of G.Salvetty in the Institute of Atomic and
Molecular Physics in Pisa (Italy) in 1992, the oscillations of heat capacity [Cp] in
0.1 M phosphate buﬀer (pH7) and in 1% solution of lysozyme in the same buﬀer
at 200C were revealed. The sensitive adiabatic diﬀerential microcalorimeter was
used for this aim. The biggest relative amplitude changing: [∆Cp]/[Cp] ∼ (0.5±
0.02)% occurs with period of about 24 hours, i.e. corresponding to circadian
rhythm.

Such oscillations can be stimulated by the variation of magnetic
and gravitational conditions of the Earth in location of experiment
during this 24h cycle.

11.4. Phenomena in water and aqueous systems, induced by
magnetic ﬁeld

In the works of (Semikhina and Kiselev, 1988, Kiselev et al., 1988, Berezin
et al., 1988) the inﬂuence of the weak magnetic ﬁeld was revealed on the di-
electric losses, the changes of dissociation constant, density, refraction index,
light scattering and electroconductivity, the coeﬃcient of heat transition, the
depth of super-cooling for distilled water and for ice also. This ﬁeld used as a
modulator a geomagnetic action.

The absorption and the ﬂuorescence of the dye (rhodamine 6G) and protein
in solutions also changed under the action of weak ﬁelds on water. The latter
circumstance reﬂects feedback links in the guest-host, or solute -solvent system.
The inﬂuence of constant and variable magnetic ﬁelds on water and ice in
the frequency range 104 − 108Hz was studied. The maximum sensitivity to
ﬁeld action was observed at the frequency νmax = 105Hz. In accordance with
our calculations, this frequency corresponds to frequency of superdeformons
excitations in water (see Fig..12.d).

A few of physical parameters changed after the long (nearly 6 hour) inﬂuence
of the variable ﬁelds ( ˜H), modulating the geomagnetic ﬁeld of the tension [H =
Hgeo] with the frequency (f ) in the range of (1 − 10) · 102Hz (Semikhina and
Kiselev, 1988, Kiselev et al., 1988):

H = H cos 2πf t

(11.10)

In the range of modulating magnetic ﬁeld (H) tension from 0.08 A/m to 212A/m
the eight maxima of dielectric losses tangent in the above mentioned (f )
range were observed. Dissociation constant decreases more than other param-
eters (by 6 times) after the incubation of ice and water in magnetic ﬁeld. The
relaxation time (”memory”) of the changes, induced in water by ﬁelds was in
the interval from 0.5 to 8 hours.

The authors interpret the experimental data obtained as the inﬂuence of
magnetic ﬁeld on the probability of proton transfer along the net of hydrogen
bonds in water and ice, which lead to the deformation of this net.

in ice is less by almost six orders (≃ 106) than that for water. On the other
hand the values of the ﬁeld - induced eﬀects in ice are several times more than in
water, and the time for reaching them in ice is less. So, the above interpretation
is doubtful.

(11.11)

In the framework of our concept all the aforementioned phenom-
ena could be explained by the shift of the (a ⇔ b) equilibrium of
primary translational and librational eﬀectons to the left.
In turn,
this shift stimulates polyeﬀectons or coherent superclusters growth, under the
inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds. Therefore, parameters such as the refraction in-
dex, dielectric permeability and light scattering have to enhance in-phase, while
the H2O dissociation constant depending on the probability of superdeformons
must decrease. The latter correlate with declined electric conductance.

As far, the magnetic moments of molecules within the coherent su-
perclusters or polyeﬀectons formed by primary librational eﬀectons
are additive parameters, then the values of changes induced by mag-
netic ﬁeld must be proportional to polyeﬀectons sizes. These sizes
are markedly higher in ice than in water and decrease with increas-
ing temperature.

Inasmuch the eﬀectons and polyeﬀectons interact with each other by means
of phonons (i.e. the subsystem of secondary deformons), and the velocity of
phonons is higher in ice than in water, then the saturation of all concomitant
eﬀects and achievement of new equilibrium state in ice is faster than in water.
The frequencies of geomagnetic ﬁeld modulation, at which changes in the
properties of water and ice have maxima can correspond to the eigen-frequencies
of the [a ⇔ b] equilibrium constant of primary eﬀectons oscillations, determined
by [assembly ⇔ disassembly] equilibrium oscillations for coherent super clusters
or polyeﬀectons.

The presence of dissolved molecules (ions, proteins) in water or ice can inﬂu-
ence on the initial [a ⇔ b] equilibrium dimensions of polyeﬀectons and,consequently
the interaction of solution with outer ﬁeld.

Narrowing of 1H-NMR lines in a salt-containing water and calcium bicar-
bonate solution was observed after magnetic ﬁeld action. This indicates that the
degree of ion hydration is decreased by magnetic treatment. On the other hand,
the width of the resonance line in distilled water remains unchanged after 30
minute treatment in the ﬁeld (135 kA/m) at water ﬂow rate of 60 cm/s (Klassen,
1982).

The hydration of diamagnetic ions (Li+, M g2+, Ca2+) decreases, while the
hydration of paramagnetic ions (F e3+, N i2+, Cu2+) increases. It leads from
corresponding changes in ultrasound velocity in ion solutions (Duhanin and
Kluchnikov, 1975).

There are numerous data which pointing to an increase the coagulation of
diﬀerent particles and their sedimentation velocity after magnetic ﬁeld treat-
ment. These phenomena provide a reducing the scale formation in heating sys-
tems, widely used in practice. Crystallization and polymerization also increase
in magnetic ﬁeld. It points to decrease of water activity.

Increasing of refraction index (n) of water and its dielectric per-
meability (ǫ ≃ n2) with in-phase enhancement of liquid viscosity (Mi-

133

nenko, 1981) are in total accordance with our hierarchic viscosity
theory.

It follows from our mesoscopic model that the increase of (n) is related
to the increase of molecular polarizability (α) due to the shift of (a ⇔ b)tr,lb
equilibrium of primary eﬀectons leftward under the action of magnetic ﬁeld. On
the other hand, distant Van der Waals interactions and consequently dimensions
of primary eﬀectons depend on α. This explains the elevation of surface tension
of liquids after magnetic treatment.

The leftward shift of (a ⇔ b)tr,lb equilibrium of primary eﬀectons must
lead to decreasing of water activity due to (n2) increasing and structural fac-
tor (T/Utot) decreasing its structure ordering. Corresponding changes in the
vapor pressure, freezing, and boiling points, coagulation, polymerization and
crystallization are the consequences of this shift and water activity decreasing.
It follows from our theory that any changes in condensed matter properties

must be accompanied by change of such parameters as:

1) density;
2) sound velocity;
3) positions of translational and librational bands in oscillatory spectra;
4) refraction index.
Using our equations and computer simulations by means of elaborated com-
puter program: Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP), it is
possible to obtain from these changes very detailed information (more than 250
parameters) about even small perturbations of matter on meso- and macroscopic
levels.

Available experimental data indicate that all of above mentioned 4 exper-
imental parameters of water have been changed indeed after magnetic treat-
ment. Minenko (1981) has shown that bidistilled water density increases by
about 0.02% after magnetic treatment (540 kA/m, ﬂow rate 80 cm/s). Sound
velocity in distilled water increases to 0.1% after treatment under conditions:
160 kA/m and ﬂow rate 60 cm/s.

The positions of the translational and librational bands of water were also

changed after magnetic treatment in 415kA/m (Klassen, 1982).

11.5. Coherent radio-frequency oscillations in water, revealed by C.
Smith

It was shown experimentally by Smith (1994) that the water display a co-
herent properties in macroscopic scale and memory. He shows that water is
capable of retaining the frequency of an alternating magnetic ﬁeld. For a tube
of water placed inside a solenoid coil, the threshold for the alternating magnetic
ﬁeld, potentiating electromagnetic frequencies into water, is 7.6 µT (rms). He
comes to conclusion that the frequency information is carried on the magnetic
vector potential.

He revealed also that in a course of yeast cells culture synchronously di-
viding, the radio-frequency emission around 1 MHz (106 1/s), 7-9 MHz (7-
9×106 1/s) and 50-80 MHz (5-9×1071/s) with very narrow bandwidth (˜50
Hz) might be observed for a few minutes.

These frequencies could correspond to frequencies of diﬀerent water collective
excitations, introduced in our Hierarchic theory, like [lb/tr] macroconvertons,

134

the [a ⇋ b]lb transitons, etc. (see Fig. 12), taking into account the deviation of
water properties in the colloid and biological systems as respect to pure one.

Cyril Smith has proposed that the increasing of coherence radius in water
could be a consequence of coherent water clusters association due to Joseph-
tunneling of molecules between clusters. As
son eﬀect (Josephson, 1965):
far primary librational eﬀectons are resulted from partial Bose-condensation
of molecules, this idea looks quite acceptable in the framework of our Hierarchic
theory.

The coherent macroscopic oscillations in tube with water, revealed by C.Smith
could be induced by coherent electromagnetic radiation of microtubules of cells,
produced by correlated intra-MTs water excitations in accordance with our Hi-
erarchic model of consciousness (see Kaivarainen, 1998 and ”New Articles” in
homepage: http://www.karelia.ru/˜alexk).

The biological eﬀects of magnetically treated water can have very impor-
tant applications. For example, hemolysis of erythrocytes is more vigorous in
magnetically pretreated physiological solutions (Trincher, 1967). Microwave
radiation induces the same eﬀect (Il’ina et al., 1979). But after boiling such ef-
fects in the treated solutions have been disappeared. It is shown that magnetic
treatment of water strongly stimulates the growth of corn and plants (Klassen,
1982).

Now it is obvious that a systematic research program is needed to understand

the physical background of multilateral eﬀects of magnetized water.

11.6. Inﬂuence of weak magnetic ﬁeld on the properties of solid
bodies

It has been established that as a result of magnetic ﬁeld action on solids
with interaction energy (µBH) much less than kT, many properties of matter
such as hardness, parameters of crystal cells and others change signiﬁcantly.

The short-time action of magnetic ﬁeld on silicon semiconductors is followed
by a very long (many days) relaxation process. The action of magnetic ﬁeld was
in the form of about 10 impulses with a length of 0.2 ms and an amplitude of
about 105A/m. The most interesting fact was that this relaxation had an oscil-
latory character with periods of about several days (Maslovsky and Postnikov,
1989).

Such a type of long period oscillation eﬀects has been found in magnetic and

nonmagnetic materials.

in solids and liquids.

This points to the general nature of the macroscopic oscillation phenomena

The period of oscillations in solids is much longer than in liquids. This may
be due to stronger deviations of the energy of (a) and (b) states of primary
eﬀectons and polyeﬀectons from thermal equilibrium and much lesser probabil-
ities of transiton and deformon excitation. Consequently, the relaxation time
of (a ⇔ b)tr,lb equilibrium shift in solids is much longer than in liquids. The
oscillations originate due to instability of dynamic equilibrium between the sub-
systems of eﬀectons and deformons.

135

11.7. Possible mechanism of perturbations of nonmagnetic materials
under magnetic treatment

We shall try to discuss the interaction of magnetic ﬁeld with diamagnetic
matter like water as an example. The magnetic susceptibility (χ) of water is a
sum of two opposite contributions (Eisenberg and Kauzmann, 1969):

1) average negative diamagnetic part, induced by external magnetic ﬁeld:

¯χd =

(χxx + χyy + χzz) ∼= −14.6(±1.9) · 10−6

(11.12)

1
2

2) positive paramagnetism related to the polarization of water molecule due
to asymmetry of electron density distribution, existing without external mag-
netic ﬁeld. Paramagnetic susceptibility (χp) of H2O is a tensor with the follow-
ing components:

xx = 2.46 · 10−6; χp
χp

yy = 0.77 · 10−6; χp

zz = 1.42 · 10−6

(11.13)

The resulting susceptibility:

χH2 = ¯χd + ¯χp ∼= −13 · 10−6

(11.14)

The second contribution in the magnetic susceptibility of water is about 10 times
lesser than the ﬁrst one. But the ﬁrst contribution to the magnetic moment of
water depends on external magnetic ﬁeld and must disappear when it is switched
out in contrast to second one.

The coherent primary librational eﬀectons of water even in liquid state con-
tain about 100 molecules
at room temperature (Fig.4a ). In ice
(nef
M )lb ≥ 104. In (a)-state the vibrations of all these molecules are synchro-
i
nized in the same phase, and in (b)-state - in counterphase. Correlation of H2O
forming eﬀectons means that the energies of interaction of water molecules with
external magnetic ﬁeld are additive:

(nef
h

M )lb ≃ 100

ǫef = nef

M · µpH

(11.15)

In such a case this total energy of eﬀecton interaction with ﬁeld may exceed
thermal energy:

ǫef > kT

(11.16)

In the case of polyeﬀectons formation this inequality becomes much stronger.
It follows from our model that interaction of magnetic ﬁeld with (a)-state
of the eﬀectons must be stronger than that with (b)-state due to the additivity
of the magnetic moments of coherent molecules:

136

a > ǫef
ǫef

b

(11.17)

Consequently, magnetic ﬁeld shifts (a ⇔ b)tr,lb equilibrium of the eﬀectons
leftward. At the same time it minimizes the potential energy of matter, because
potential energy of (a)-state (Va) is lesser than (Vb):

Va < Vb

and Ea < Eb,

(11.18)

where Ea = Va + T a

kin; Eb = Vb + T b

kin are total energies of the eﬀectons.

We keep in mind that the kinetic energies of (a) and (b)-states are equal:

kin = T b
T a

kin = p2/2m.

These energies decreases with increasing of the eﬀectons dimensions, deter-

mined by the most probable impulses in selected directions:

λ1,2,3 = h/p1,2,3

The energy of interaction of magnetic ﬁeld with deformons as a transition state
of eﬀectons must be even less than ǫef
b due to lesser order of molecules in this
state and reciprocal compensation of their magnetic moments:

ǫd < ǫef

b ≤ ǫef

a

(11.19)

This important inequality means that as a result of external magnetic ﬁeld
action the shift of (a ⇔ b)tr,lb leftward is reinforced by leftward shift of equilib-
rium [eﬀectons ⇋ deformons] subsystems of matter.

If water is ﬂowing in a tube it increases the relative orientations of all ef-
fectons in volume and stimulate the coherent superclusters formation. All the
above discussed eﬀects must increase. Similar ordering phenomena happen in a
rotating tube with liquid.

After switching oﬀ the external magnetic ﬁeld the relaxation of induced ferro-
magnetism in water begins. It may be accompanied by the oscillatory behavior
of (a ⇔ b)tr,lb equilibrium. All the experimental eﬀects discussed above can
be explained as a consequence of orchestrated in volume (a ⇔ b) equilibrium
oscillations.

Remnant ferromagnetism in water was experimentally established using a
SQUID superconducting magnetometer by Kaivarainen et al. in 1992 at Phys-
ical department of University of Turku (unpublished data).

In these experiments water was treated in constant magnetic ﬁeld 50G for
two hours. Then it was frozen and after switching oﬀ external magnetic ﬁeld the
remnant ferromagnetism was registered at helium temperature. Even at this low
temperature the slow relaxation of ferromagnetic signal amplitude was revealed.
These results point to the correctness of the proposed mechanism of magnetic
ﬁeld - water interaction and perturbation. In the future this mechanism can be
developed to quantitative level.

The attempt to make a theory of magnetic ﬁeld inﬂuence on water based on
other model were made already (Yashkichev, 1980). However, this theory does

137

not take into account the quantum properties of water and cannot be considered
as a complete one.

The comprehensive material obtained by group of S. Shnol (1987, 1998)
when studying macroscopic oscillations of very diﬀerent nature reveals their
fundamental character and their dependence on gravitational coherent global
perturbations.

For more detailed discussion of like phenomena see my article: Dynamic
model of wave-particle duality, Bi-vacuum and Superuniﬁcation”, placed at

12. INNOVATION, BASED ON NEW THEORY:
Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP)
[see: www.karelia.ru/˜alexk (CAMP)]

The set of formulae obtained in our theory allows to calculate about 300
parameters of any condensed matter (liquid or solid). Most of them are hidden,
i.e. inaccessible for direct experimental measurements.

Simulations evaluation of these parameters can be done using our computer

program: CAMP (copyright 1997) and the following experimental methods:

1. Far-middle IR spectroscopy for determination the positions of transla-

tional or librational bands: (30-2500) cm-1;

2. Sound velocimetry;
3. Dilatometry or densitometry, for molar volume or density registration;
4. Refractometry.
Corresponding data should be obtained simultaneously at the same temper-
ature and pressure from the SAME SAMPLE in ideal case. Among the param-
eters of matter evaluated are so important as:
internal energy, heat capacity,
thermal conductivity, viscosity, coeﬃcient of self-diﬀusion, surface tension, sol-
vent activity, vapor pressure, internal pressure, parameters of all types of quasi-
particles (concentration, volume, dimensions, energy, probability of excitation,
life-time) and many others.

This leads to idea of new optoacoustic device: Comprehensive Analyzer of
Matter Properties (CAMP), which may provide a huge amount of data of any
condensed system under study. The most complicated and expensive component
of CAMP is FT-IR spectrometer for far and middle region. The most sensitive
parameter is sound velocity. The less sensitive and stable parameter is molar
volume or density.

One of possible CAMP conﬁguration should include special attachment to
FT-IR spectrometer, making it possible registration of reﬂection spectra in
far/middle IR region. Such approach allows to study the properties of sam-
ples with strong IR absorption (i.e. aqueous systems) and non transparent
mediums. The combination of modiﬁed FT-IR spectrometer with other equip-
ment for simultaneous measurement of matter density and sound velocity and
refraction index will provide 4 parameters, necessary for CAMP function. The
sample cell for liquids and solids should have a shape, convenient to make all
these measurements simultaneously.

The another conﬁguration of CAMP may include except FT-IR, the Brillouin
light scattering spectrometer. It makes possible simultaneous measurement of

138

sound velocity (from the Doppler shift of side bands of Brillouin spectra) and
positions of intermolecular bands [tr and lb] in oscillatory spectra in the far IR.
Our hierarchic theory of Brillouin light scattering gives much more information
about condensed matter properties than conventional one.

The interface of CAMP with personal computer will allow monitoring of very

diﬀerent dynamic physical process in real time, using our computer program.

Possible Applications for Comprehensive
Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP)

ties, related to taste and biological activity;

It may be useful for: a) de-infection
of drinking water; b) stimulation of sonoluminiscense; c) development of pure
energy technology; d) cold fusion stimulation.

Application to nonaqueous systems

1. Fundamental research in all branches of condensed matter physics: ther-
modynamics, dynamics, phase transitions, transport process, surface tension,
self-diﬀusion, viscosity, vapor pressure, etc.

2. Monitoring of new materials technology for searching the optimal condi-
tions (T, P, physical ﬁelds) for providing the optimal parameters on mesoscopic
and macroscopic scale for their best quality;

3. Study of mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity;
4. Study of mechanism of superﬂuidity.

Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP) represents a basi-
cally new type of scientiﬁc equipment, allowing to get incomparable big amount
of information concerning physics of liquids or solids. It can be very useful for
investigation of dynamics and mesoscopic structure of pure matter as well as
solid and liquid solutions, the colloid systems and host-guest systems.

139

The market for Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP) is
free and due to its unique informational potential could be much bigger than
that for IR, Raman or Brillouin spectrometers.

CONCLUSION

A quantum based new hierarchic quantitative theory, general for solids
and liquids, has been developed. It is assumed, that anharmonic oscillations of
particles in any condensed matter lead to emergence of three-dimensional (3D)
superposition of standing de Broglie waves of molecules, electromagnetic and
acoustic waves. Consequently, any condensed matter could be considered as a
gas of 3D standing waves of corresponding nature. Our approach uniﬁes and
develops the Einstein’s and Debye’s models.

Collective excitations, like 3D standing de Broglie waves of molecules, rep-
resenting at certain conditions the molecular Bose condensate, were analyzed,
as a background of hierarchic model of condensed matter.

The most probable de Broglie wave (wave B) length is determined by the
ratio of Plank constant to the most probable impulse of molecules, or by ratio
of its most probable phase velocity to frequency. The waves B of molecules are
related to their translations (tr) and librations (lb).

As the quantum dynamics of condensed matter is anharmonic and does not
follow the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the real most probable de
Broglie wave length can exceed the classical thermal de Broglie wave length and
the distance between centers of molecules many times.

This makes possible the atomic and molecular mesoscopic Bose condensa-
tion in solids and liquids at temperatures, below boiling point. It is one of the
most important results of new theory, which we have conﬁrmed by computer
simulations on examples of water and ice and applying to Virial theorem.

Four strongly interrelated new types of quasiparticles (collective excita-

tions) were introduced in our hierarchic model:

1. Eﬀectons (tr and lb), existing in ”acoustic” (a) and ”optic” (b) states

represent the coherent clusters in general case;

2. Convertons, corresponding to interconversions between tr and lb types of

the eﬀectons (ﬂickering clusters);

3. Transitons are the intermediate [a ⇋ b] transition states of the tr and lb

eﬀectons;

4. Deformons are the 3D superposition of IR electromagnetic or acoustic

waves, activated by transitons and convertons.

Primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are formed by 3D superposition of the
most probable standing de Broglie waves of the oscillating ions, atoms or
molecules. The volume of eﬀectons (tr and lb) may contain from less than one,
to tens and even thousands of molecules. The ﬁrst condition means validity
of classical approximation in description of the subsystems of the eﬀectons.
The second one points to quantum properties of coherent clusters due to
mesoscopic Bose condensation (BC), in contrast to macroscopic BC,
pertinent for superﬂuidity and supercoductivity.

The liquids are semiclassical systems because their primary (tr) eﬀectons
contain less than one molecule and primary (lb) eﬀectons - more than one

140

molecule. The solids are quantum systems totally because both kind of their pri-
mary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are mesoscopic molecular Bose condensates. These
consequences of our theory are conﬁrmed by computer simulations.

The 1st order [gas → liquid] transition is accompanied by strong decreas-
ing of number of rotational (librational) degrees of freedom due to emergence of
primary (lb) eﬀectons and [liquid → solid] transition - by decreasing of trans-
lational degrees of freedom due to Bose-condensation of primary (tr) eﬀectons.
In the general case the eﬀecton can be approximated by parallelepiped with
edges determined by de Broglie waves length in three selected directions (1, 2, 3),
related to symmetry of molecular dynamics. In the case of isotropic molecular
motion the eﬀectons’ shape is approximated by cube.

The number of molecules in the volume of primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) is
considered as the ”parameter of order” in our theory of 1st order phase transi-
tions.

The in-phase oscillations of molecules in the eﬀectons correspond to the
eﬀecton’s (a) - acoustic state and the counterphase oscillations correspond to
their (b) - optic state. States (a) and (b) of the eﬀectons diﬀer in potential
energy only, however, their kinetic energies, impulses and spatial dimensions -
are the same. The b-state of the eﬀectons has a common feature with
Fr¨olich’s polar mode.

The (a → b) or (b → a) transition states of the primary eﬀectons (tr and
lb), deﬁned as primary transitons, are accompanied by a change in molecule
polarizability and dipole moment without density ﬂuctuations. At this case
they lead to absorption or radiation of IR photons, respectively.

Superposition of three internal standing IR photons of diﬀerent directions

(1,2,3) - forms primary electromagnetic deformons (tr and lb).

On the other hand, the [lb ⇋ tr] convertons and secondary transitons are
accompanied by the density ﬂuctuations, leading to absorption or radiation of
phonons.

Superposition of standing phonons in three directions (1,2,3), forms sec-

ondary acoustic deformons (tr and lb).

Correlated collective excitations of primary and secondary eﬀectons and de-
formons (tr and lb), localized in the volume of primary tr and lb electromag-
netic deformons, lead to origination of macroeﬀectons, macrotransitons
and macrodeformons (tr and lb respectively).

Correlated simultaneous excitations of tr and lb macroeﬀectons in the vol-
ume of superimposed tr and lb electromagnetic deformons lead to origination
of supereﬀectons.

In turn, the simultaneous excitation of both: tr and lb macrodeformons
and macroconvertons in the same volume means origination of superdefor-
mons. Superdeformons are the biggest (cavitational) ﬂuctuations, leading to
microbubbles in liquids and to local defects in solids.

Total number of quasiparticles of condensed matter equal to 4!=24, reﬂects
all of possible combinations of the four basic ones [1-4], introduced above. This
set of collective excitations in the form of ”gas” of 3D standing waves of three
types: de Broglie, acoustic and electromagnetic - is shown to be able to explain
virtually all the properties of all condensed matter.

The important positive feature of our hierarchic model of matter is that it
does not need the semi-empiric intermolecular potentials for calculations, which

141

are unavoidable in existing theories of many body systems. The potential energy
of intermolecular interaction is involved indirectly in dimensions and stability
of quasiparticles, introduced in our model.

The main formulae of theory are the same for liquids and solids and include
following experimental parameters, which take into account their diﬀerent prop-
erties:

[1]- Positions of (tr) and (lb) bands in oscillatory spectra;
[2]- Sound velocity;
[3]- Density;
[4]- Refraction index.
The knowledge of these four basic parameters at the same temperature and
pressure makes it possible using our computer program, to evaluate more than
300 important characteristics of any condensed matter. Among them are such
as: total internal energy, kinetic and potential energies, heat-capacity and ther-
mal conductivity, surface tension, vapor pressure, viscosity, coeﬃcient of self-
diﬀusion, osmotic pressure, solvent activity, etc. Most of calculated parameters
are hidden, i.e. inaccessible to direct experimental measurement.

This is the ﬁrst theory able to predict all known experimental anomalies for
water and ice. The conformity between theory and experiment is very good
even without adjustable parameters.

The hierarchic concept creates a bridge between micro- and macro- phenom-
ena, dynamics and thermodynamics, liquids and solids in terms of quantum
physics.

Computerized veriﬁcation of our Hierarchic theory of matter on
examples of water and ice has been performed, using special computer
program: Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP,
copyright, 1997, Kaivarainen). The new optoacoustic device (CAMP),
based on this program, with possibilities much wider, than that of IR,
Raman and Brillouin spectrometers, has been proposed by the author
(see URL: http://www.karelia.ru/˜alexk [CAMP]).

The demo (free) and commercial version of program are available

and may be ordered.

Abstract

We consider diﬀerent deductions of the mysterious Weinberg for-
mula and show that this leads us back to the model of ﬂuctuational
cosmology which correctly predicted in advance, dark energy driven,
accelerating universe with a small cosmological constant. All this also
provides us with an interpretation of Gravitation as the distributional
eﬀect of the residual energy of the universe.

1 Introduction

We consider a model in which √N particles were created out of the back-
ground Quantum Vaccuum in an interval τ in a Critical Point phase transi-
tion [1, 2, 3]. That is we have

where N denotes the number of particles and τ a typical elementary particle
Compton time.
The above 1997 model correctly predicted a dark energy driven accelerating
universe with a small cosmological constant. All of this was conﬁrmed by
observation over the next six years [4, 5, 6, 7]. Infact from (1) we have on
integration

1080 is the well known number of
where T is the age of the universe and N
elementary particles, typically pions, in the universe. Infact (2) immediately

leads to the well known so called Eddington formula

Apart from an accelerating universe with a small cosmological constant, the
above model also deduced from theory the so called Dirac large number re-
lations and also (3), all of which were known purely as empirical relations
without any theoretical basis. The model also deduced the mysterious em-
pirical Weinberg formula

where m is the pion mass, H is the Hubble constant and the other symbols
having their usual signiﬁcance. One of the relations deduced is the following:

R = √N l

m =

G =

√N m

We will now examine the implications of all this.

2 Characterizing G

We will now digress a little to arrive at the Weinberg formula (4) from an
alternative route following Sivaram and Landsberg [8, 9]. He uses the gravita-
tional self energy of an elementary particle like the pion with the Uncertainty
relation to deduce

(4).
But if we continue with (6), then we get

H in (6), then we recover the Weinberg formula

The right side of (7) can give back the equation (5). We note that (7) can
be rewritten as

If in (8) we use the well known relations,

R =

GM
c2 , M = Nm

we can get back (5). It must be observed that in the above derivation we
have independently obtained (2). Another point to be stressed is that (5)
gives a diﬀerent interpretation of G. Rather than being fundamental, it turns
out to be “distributional” over the whol4e universe (Cf.Section 4). It is the
residual energy between the elementary particles over the whole universe, as
a result of the Planck scale underpinning of the universe.
To continue, we observe that (7) implies that G, as in the Dirac cosmology
depends on time and is given by

G = G0/T

This time variation given in (10) can be shown to explain standard observa-
tions like the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, the bending of light,
the decrease in the orbital period of binary pulsars and even the otherwise in-
explicable acceleration of the Pioneer spacecrafts [10, 11]. Equally, we could
argue that from (10) we could recover (2) and (1).
There is another way to see this. We use the fact that (Cf. Section 4)
1040) Planck oscillators form the underpinning of a typical elementary
n(
particle like the pion which is the ground state. That is,

∼

10−5gms. The ﬂuctuations in the

∼
ground state of this n oscillator system is given by ∆E given by (11). So the
time for this Uncertainty is given by

In other words there are √n particles due
where τP is the Planck time.
to the uncertainty of ﬂuctuation in the time τP . Whence, the rate of the
ﬂuctuational appearance of these particles is given by

(13) is another form of (1).
In other words, we arrive at the starting point of Section 1 and then the
subsequent relations, from an alternative view point.
Finally, it may be observed that the ground state of the 10120 Planck oscil-
lators which form an underpinning for the universe (Cf.Section 4) has the
mass, 10−65gm.
It is quite remarkable that this is the same mass, which
according to Landsberg [9], is the minimum mass observable in the life time
of the universe.

3 The Bi-Scalar Universe

We now make a few observations. The random walk relations (3) could be
rewritten as, at the Planck scale as,

l2 = nl2
P

(14)

Equation (14) brings out the irreducible Quantum of area at the Planck scale,
as has proved to be very useful and meaningful in recent Quantum Gravity
approaches [12]. It is interesting that we have obtained a rationale for the
Quantum of area in terms of a random process. We could think of this in
the following model. Let us consider the normals to the Planck area.
In
the Quantum vaccuum they would be randomly distributed, as in the Ising
model [14]. At this stage of incoherence we cannot think of a particle like
the pion, which infact as shown above and earlier [13] is a normal mode of
these Planck oscillators. However, let us consider a phase transition at the
critical point for these n oscillators, exactly as in Ising model. Infact from
critical point theory we have [14, 15, 16],
¯Qν = ¯ξβ
(15)
In (15) ¯Q is the reduced order parameter, the ratio of the constituents in the
state of order or coherence to the total number of constituents, while ¯ξ is the
reduced coherence length, that is the ratio of the minimum elemental areas
P to the area l2 that emerges due to the critical point transition.
in our case l2
That is we have

¯Q

∼

√n

, ¯ξ = (lP /l)2,

(16)

Further from the universality of the exponents at the critical point (Cf.refs.[14,
15]), we have

ν

2β

≈

4

whence we get from (15) and (16) the equation

l = √nlP

R = √Nl,

which is nothing but (1) or the area equation (14).
In a similar fashion, working with l and R instead of lP , l and using (15) and
(16), we can recover the relation

that is (3), as indeed is expected in Critical Point theory.
To complete the analysis of this model, we have to consider the behavior
of the coupling constants. We know from Critical Point theory that for the
coupling constants we have

J (1)/kT (1)

c = 1 J (2)/kT (2)

c = 1,

where in our case, in this model,

c /T (2)
T (1)

c = l/R

Thus we get

J (1)/J (2) = l/R
(17)
As J (1) = Gm2 and J (2) = e2 are the coupling constants at the scale of
gravitation in the macro universe and electromagnetism in the micro universe,
we get from (17) on using (2)

Gm2
e2 =

(18)

If our above model is correct (18) should be valid. Indeed it is a well known
empirical relation and validates the above model.
Interestingly we can derive the result (18) directly from the Planck scale
considerations (instead of the Compton scale derivation).
Yet another derivation is from (7). It can be written as

which gives (18) if we remember that ¯hc
This demonstrates how incoherent Planck oscillators can in phase transition
like phenomena form the physical particles of the universe. Similar arguments
would apply for elementary particles leading to equation (3).

4 The Planck, the Compton and the Hubble

Scales

There are a few relations involving microphysical constants and large scale
parameters which have been longstanding puzzles. One of them is the relation
between the mass of the pion, a typical elementary particle, and the Hubble
constant seen earlier, viz. [17]

Another is [18, 19]

H¯h2

R

GM
c2

In (19) m is the pion mass, H the Hubble cosntant, ¯h the reduced Planck
constant, G the gravitational constant, c the velocity of light while in (20) R
is the radius of the universe and M its mass. This apart there are the well
known so called large number coincidences, made famous by Dirac, involving
the number of particles in the universe [7, 20].
In these and other such
relations, the equality is always taken to be in the order of magnitude sense.
Further, we follow Dirac and Melnikov in taking constants like G, c, m etc.
as being microphysical constants (Cf.ref.[7]).
Weinberg noted that the relation (19) is inexplicable as it connects constants
from microphysics to the cosmological parameter H. On the other hand the
relation (20) exhibits the universe as a Schwarzschild black hole (Cf. also
[2]. Infact one can even show that the time taken by light to traverse the
distance R, viz. T the age of the universe is the same as for the interior of a
Schwarzschild black hole.)
We will now argue that relations like (19) and (20) can be explained in terms
of a Planck scale underpinning for the universe [21, 13].
Our starting point is the following observation: The position operator for the
Klein-Gordan equation is given by [22]

From (21) we get [7, 1]

~Xop = ~xop −

Mathematically (22) shows that ˆX 2
op gives a problem identical to the har-
monic oscillator with quantized levels: Infact the quantized “space-levels”
for ~X 2
op turn out to be, as can be easily veriﬁed, multiples of (¯h/mc)2!
From here, we get ∆t = ∆x
the Dirac equation also).
As is well known the minimum value for ¯h/mc is the Planck length, which
10−5gms,
happens to be the Compton length of a Planck mass particle mP ∼
as also its Schwarzschild radius

mc2 . (A similar analysis can be carried out for

c = ¯h

lP = GmP /c2

The minimum Planck length ofcourse plays a crucial role both in Quantum
Super Strings theory and Quantum Gravity [23, 24, 25]. In the modern view,
these Planck oscillators are created out of the Quantum Vaccuum.
Returning to the mathematical Harmonic oscillator problem for the Klein-
Gordon (spinless) equation, as is well known [26],the quantized energy (in our
case length squared) levels are given as multiples of the number of oscillators
N and the minimum (or “ground”) state:

(Length)2

Nl2

∼

l being the Planck /Compton length in question.
We thus have the following equations:

R = √N lP = √ ¯Nl, l = √nlP

where N, ¯N and n are certain large numbers whose value we will get below
and l is the Compton wavelength of a typical elementary particle like the
pion. In the second of (24), we consider the fact that there are ¯N elementary
particles in the universe, while in the third relation, an elementary particle
like the pion has an underpinning of n Planck oscillators.
From (24) it can easily be seen that

If in (24) we use the explicit expression for the Compton length, we can easily
deduce that, m being the pion mass,

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

N = ¯N n

mP = √nm

7

As we have supposed that there are N Planck masses in the universe, their
gravitational energy (they do not have any electromagnetic energy as they
are chargeless) should equal the energy of the universe that is

M being the mass of the universe.
Using the fact that the Planck length is also the Schwarschild radius of the
Planck mass we get with (24),

Similarly if we use the fact that n Planck masses make up the pion, we have

Whence we get

The above equations can also be written as

Whence it also follows that

So,

And

we will get

its energy, that is, using (31),

(27)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

It will be seen that (32) is the same as (20). Infact we could obtain (32)
alternatively from (27) and its preceding equation.
If we use (24) and subsequent equations in (32) we get immediately

G =

c2l
m√ ¯N

(33)

Whence we have

(

¯N =

We have thus deduced the well known number of elementary particles (like
the pions) in the universe, in terms of the microphysical constants in (34).
Immediately we can see that from equations like (25), (29) and (30) that

N
Weinberg formula (19) from these equations. Infact this follows from (19)
and (24) if we remember that

10120 and n

(34)

∼

H = c/R

where H is the Hubble constant. Moreover, it can be seen that equations
like (26), (27) and (28) are all consistent.
Using the fact that from the Klein-Gordan equation, the squares of the length
intervals are quantized, equations (21), (22) and (23) and using the fact
that the minimum length is at the Planck scale, which therefore provides an
underpinning for the universe, and using only the values of the microphysical
constants, all of the hitherto mysterious empirical large number relations and
the Weinberg formula are seen to be a consequence of the theory and are
deducable. They are not adhoc empirical relations as hitherto supposed.

5 Remarks

1. We observe that (32) also be obtained in a Friedman uniformly expanding
universe. Given (32), using (24), we can deduce (27), (29) and (30) and
thence (33) (0r (34)). From (33) we have

ogy.
2. In the context of self energy, we can get a clue to the origin of the energy
of a particle in the Dirac development in the following manner. Following
Dirac [27], we have

Equation (39) shows that, neglecting the external motion of the particle,
within the Compton wavelength the particle behaves like the Harmonic os-
cillator. We can get a better idea of this oscillator system if we consider the
classical equation

On the one hand, (41) can be identiﬁed with (36) on using (37) and (38) and
all this leads us back to the Harmonic oscillator equation (36) which gives
the energy levels for the particle. This can be identiﬁed with the inertial
energy of the particle.

annihilate producing gamma rays. Such MeV particles have been proposed
recently [29] as candidates for the gamma rays. On the other hand, it was

Abstract

Two common misconceptions about the theory of Special Relativity that are actively taught
in textbooks are discussed. It is shown, ﬁrst, that the Lorentz transformations are actually
transformations of the coordinates of a photon, not the coordinates of a particle as taught
by some authors. Secondly, a misconception concerning the relativistic Lagrangian is dis-
cussed. It is shown that the currently accepted formulation of the Lagrangian is missing
an important constant of integration. By incorporating the missing constant of integration,
the new Lagrangian directly supports the conclusions reached previously by the author
concerning the mass-energy equivalence principle.

Preface:

This paper will be the last in my series of pa-
pers on the principle of mass-energy equiva-
lence. Since my previous papers have essen-
tially fallen on deaf ears (with the exception
of a few, truly remarkable individuals), I have
regrettably concluded that it is now time to
stop “preaching to the wind”. Not until all
the logic-defying excuses that started in 1930
(a.k.a. the Neutrino theories) totally collapse
as a result of their ever-increasing state of
chaos, can someone who is truly intelligent re-
alize that something is potentially wrong with
the current state of subatomic physics.

1. Misconception concerning the
Lorentz Transformations:

tions are introduced in many of the contem-
porary references on Special Relativity (SR)
[1, 2] as the transformations of the coordinates
of “an object in motion”, such as a particle. A
careful examination of Einstein’s argument in
his paper of 1905 [3], however, leaves no doubt
that the Lorentz transformations are indeed
transformations that describe the coordinates
of a photon. The error of assuming that the
transformations describe the coordinates of a
material object is usually made because of the
failure to distinguish between the coordinates
of an object and the coordinates of an “event”
in space-time that is described, according to
SR, by the propagation of a light signal. This
observation, of course, will have very impor-
tant implications for the various applications
of the Lorentz transformations, and, in partic-
ular, the principle of mass-energy equivalence.

It is regrettable that the Lorentz transforma-

According to the 1905 paper, the following is

the argument of SR: if a photon is propagating
and is observed simultaneously in two frames
of reference S and S′ (where S is the station-
ary frame and S′ is the moving frame), then
x = ct and x′ = ct′ are two experimentally ver-
iﬁed relationships that we must hold as true.
Hence, in order to accommodate the law of
the constancy of the velocity of light in the
two frames, t 6= t′ (time must be somehow dis-
torted by a factor γ). Accordingly, any Newto-
nian distance must also appear to be distorted
by the same factor γ. The distance traversed
by the moving frame S′, being equal to vt, will
be therefore given by v(γt′) = γvt′. Hence the
x coordinate of the photon will be

x = γx′ + γvt′
= γ(x′ + vt′)

(1)

This is the ﬁrst of the Lorentz transformations.
The rest of the derivation that leads to the
second transformation t = γ(t′ + vx′/c2) then
proceeds by using the reciprocal relationship
and substituting for x and x′ by x = ct and
x′ = ct′. It is therefore very important to note
that x and x′, according to the argument of
SR, are strictly the coordinates of a photon,
not of a particle.

What the coordinates of a particle will be
then? Since the particle is assumed to be at
rest in the moving frame S′, then x′ = 0, and
hence the Lorentz transformations take the re-
duced form

x = γvt′
′
t = γt

The conclusion therefore is that the full
Lorentz transformations apply only to the co-

ordinates of a propagating photon. For a ma-
terial body that is assumed to be at rest in the
moving frame S′, the reduced Lorentz trans-
formations of Eq.(2) will be the correct trans-
formations to apply. Using the full transfor-
mations to describe the coordinates of a par-
ticle does indeed lead to serious errors and in-
explicable results. As was pointed out in [5],
de Broglie’s use of the full Lorentz transforma-
tion of time is essentially what led him to the
amazing velocity c2/v. However, it was also
pointed out in [5] that the full transformations
can still be used to transform quantities such
as velocity and momentum of a material parti-
cle, provided that we pay special attention to
the constant c that is attached to the time co-
ordinate. As was shown in that paper, the full
transformations can be successfully used only
if we treat c as a “light like” velocity compo-
nent that has a non-vanishing derivative with
respect to time.

2. Misconception concerning the
Relativistic Lagrangian:

2.1. The missing constant of integration:

Another common misconception is about the
currently accepted formulation of the relativis-
tic Lagrangian. The relativistic Lagrangian
was never given by Einstein, Lorentz, or
Poincar´e, but was actually derived by a num-
ber of modern authors [2, 6]. The derivation of
the relativistic Lagrangian typically proceeds
as follows: by taking the free-particle equation
of motion

F =

(γm0v) = 0

d

(where F is the force, p is the momentum and
v is the velocity), together with the Euler-
Lagrange equation of motion

rest. We can indeed conﬁrm that Eq.(8) is the
correct result by simply noting the following
fact about the action integral A [2, 7]:

(4)

where L is the Lagrangian and qi are the co-
ordinates, and given that ∂L/∂qi = 0 for a
free particle, we are then directly led to the
condition

∂L
∂v

= γm0v,

(5)

where we have assumed motion along one
Jackson and
dimension only for simplicity.
Goldstein [2, 6] showed that a Lagrangian that
will satisfy this equation will be (which can
be obtained by direct integration; note that
γ = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2)

L = −m0c2

1 − v2/c2

(6)

q
The problem here obviously is that the possi-
ble existence of a constant of integration was
completely ignored. If we integrate Eq.(5) be-
tween the limits 0 and v,

A =

L dt

t2

t1

Z

(9)

If we write the action integral in terms of the
proper time τ , where dτ = dt/γ, it becomes

A =

γL dτ

(10)

τ2

τ1

Z

If we now multiply the expression in Eq.(8) by
γ, it becomes

γL =

m0c2
1 − v2/c2

− m0c2

Hence Eq.(10) can be written as

(Relativistic Kinetic Energy) dτ

(12)

we obtain instead

L = m0c2(1 −

1 − v2/c2)

(8)

q

The missing constant of integration is there-
fore the quantity m0c2 (it is worthwhile to note
that Einstein did not ignore the constant of
integration in his derivation of the relativistic
kinetic energy [3]). Note that for a velocity
v = 0, Eq.(6) gives L = −m0c2 while Eq.(8)
gives L = 0. We should expect L to be equal
to 0 at rest, since, in the absence of external
forces, the Lagrangian is simply the kinetic en-
ergy, and the kinetic energy is equal to 0 at

In the absence of external forces (i.e., po-
tential energy), this is indeed the expression
that we should expect to obtain. Perhaps
what aided in supporting the misconception
is another misconception, namely, that the ac-
tion integral A in Eq.(12) above must be a
Lorentz invariant quantity (see the discussion
in ref.[2]). However, we must distinguish be-
tween Lorentz invariance and path invariance.
The proper time τ in Eq.(12) above is Lorentz
invariant but the quantity A is path-invariant
(note that this is true only for small variations
in the path, due to the extremum condition
∆A = 0). The opposite, however, is not true.

τ is not path-invariant and A should not be au-
tomatically assumed to be a Lorentz-invariant
quantity.

2.2. The relationship between the La-
grangian and the Hamiltonian:

q

If we now take the corrected expression of the
Lagrangian in Eq.(8) and let v ≈ c, we ob-
tain L = m0c2. This result suggests that
there is, at least, a relationship between the
Lagrangian and the mass-energy quantity (it
was demonstrated in ref.[4] that the quan-
tity m0c2(1 −
1 − v2/c2) is indeed the mass-
energy of a particle). To put things into per-
spective, we now make the following distinc-
tion between the deﬁnition of the Lagrangian
in classical mechanics and its deﬁnition in rel-
ativistic mechanics:
in the classical (Newto-
nian) mechanics, the Lagrangian of a free par-
ticle (that is, in the absence of external forces)
is simply its kinetic energy. In relativistic me-
chanics, Eq.(11) shows that the Lagrangian is
given by the ratio of the relativistic kinetic en-
ergy to the Lorentz gamma factor, or Ek/γ.
Now, the emergence of L = m0c2 for v ≈ c
suggests very strongly that the mass-energy
of a free particle is equal to the ratio Ek/γ
(which has an upper limit of m0c2). This point
was also clear from ref.[4]. To summarize, it is
quite apparent from these results that

What does the above result then mean as far as
the concept of the Hamiltonian is concerned?
As we know, the Hamiltonian H of a free par-
ticle is the sum of the kinetic and the mass
energies. Hence,

The conclusion therefore is that the (mathe-
matically correct!) Lagrangian given by Eq.(8)
supports the total energy equation H = mv2.

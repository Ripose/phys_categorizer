Abstract

The concepts of local and global colour singletness in QCD are analyzed
within a framework of a group theoretical technique which can project out
various colour representations of the QGP. A proof of colour singletness is
thereby provided. This also leads to an explanation of the baryon asymmetry
in the universe within the framework of QCD itself. Supersymmetry plays a
basic role in this explanation as well as providing us with a consistent con-
nection between the current and the constituent picture of quarks. Glueballs
as a Dark Matter candidate manifest themselves herein. Baryonlessness of
QGP is a clear prediction of this model.

Colour conﬁnement is an outstanding problem of quantum chromody-
namics. In spite of intense eﬀorts one still does not know as to how it arises
in QCD and even comparisons with the intrinsic diﬃculties of the Fermat’s
Last Problem are being made [1, p.291]. The equally signiﬁcant problem
of baryon asymmetry in the universe is generally believed not to arise from
QCD. One invokes exotic frameworks to understand this phenomena. In this
paper however, it shall be shown that actually the colour conﬁnement and
baryon asymmetry are correlated and can be understood within QCD. This
will help explain the current and constituent quark connection. Supersym-
metry shall appear as basic to this understanding. This will also help in
solving the Dark Matter conundrum.

It is an experimental fact that as of now no convincing case of free coloured
objects has yet been discovered. This is the primary reason for invoking the
colour conﬁnement hypothesis in QCD. Though no violation of the same has
yet been found, the idea is still referred to as a ”hypothesis” as the same
has not been demonstrated to follow from QCD. This is essentially a ’local’
colour conﬁnement hypothesis. ’Local’ is to sense that all known hadrons of
size less than ∼ 1 − 2 fm conﬁne quarks and gluons and are believed to be
in the colour singlet state.

However with the advent of the possibility of quark-gluon plasma it is
believed that at high enough temperatures and densities the quarks and
gluons become deconﬁned. Deconﬁned, with respect to the ’local’ colour
conﬁnement concept stated above. It is commonly believed that this QGP
should still be colour conﬁned ’globally’. In fact, QGP is understood to be
a transition from a local colour singlet framework to a global colour singlet
framework [2]. In the theory of Heavy Ion Collision scenario of the creation of
QGP the ’global’ preﬁx really means that at the scale of two heavy colliding
and overlapping nuclei in sizes of ∼ 10 − 20 fm the QGP is globally conﬁned.
If there be ’quark stars’ of size of a few kilometres, as in some astrophysical
scenarios, then this too is expected to be globally colour singlet over this
large size [3]. In fact this concept of global colour singletness is routinely
extrapolated to invoke colour singletness for the whole universe as well!

The empirical evidence for conﬁnement as stated above is lack of any free
coloured object in various searches. However. this can easily be understood
as a result of the ’local’ colour singlet hypothesis alone. That is just to explain
this one need not invoke global colour singlet hypothesis. Note that there
are no astrophysical scenarios where QGP is being generated spontaneously

2

( though we are trying to create QGP in the laboratory artiﬁcially ) today.
Also there are no known clear cut cases of quark stars. Therefor there is
In fact if
no clearcut empirical support for the ’global’ colour hypothesis.
a quark matter were to exist at the centre of a neutron star then one need
not invoke any colour conﬁnement hypothesis as these quarks would then
be conﬁned automatically by the pressure of the surrounding matter. The
situation is similar to the ”little bag” model of hadrons ( popular sometime
ago ) where the quarks were conﬁned inside baryons by the pressure of the
pions outside. So given all the astrophysical realities, the ”global” colour
hypothesis should basically be treated as an assumption. As such it may be
put to test empirically.

Hence to distinguish these conﬁnement scenarios it would be appropriate
to classify as ”strong” conﬁnement hypothesis as the one which just incor-
porates the ’local’ colour hypothesis. But at large distances it does not
necessarily invoke global colour hypothesis. So in principle the ’strong’ con-
ﬁnement hypothesis takes the philosophy that we really do not know as to
whether colour singletness is guaranteed globally or not and hence we allow
for other colour representations to play a role if necessary. The preﬁx ’strong’
here is used to take account of the fact that as far as we know for sure today
( ie. empirically ) local colour singleteness is all that we are sure of.
In
the same spirit let us label the hypothesis which incorporates global colour
singlet hypothesis as ’weak’ conﬁnement hypothesis. The preﬁx ’weak’ to ac-
count for the fact that no speciﬁc empirical evidence of the same exists and
that it is actually a theoretical assumption. Note though that in the limit of
size 1-2 fm the ”global” colour conﬁnement hypothesis would collapse to the
”local” colour conﬁnement hypothesis.

Let us next ask whether we can completely ignore the ’weak’ conﬁnement
hypothesis and just use the ’strong’ conﬁnement hypothesis. What this would
mean is that globally the QGP (like the one we are trying to create in heavy
ion collisions in the laboratory at present) may actually be globally colour
non-singlet. Coloured objects would not leak out of this global coloured QGP
due to the fact that all the particles would be conﬁned due to the dynamics
of the collision. Later as the QGP cools it will produce only locally colour
singlet objects. By demanding the ’weak’ conﬁnement hypothesis one may be
invoking a spurious global colour conﬁnement and thereby be missing some
essential physics. As we shall show below, indeed we are missing quite a lot
of physical reality by doing so!

3

To understand this let us consider a bunch of quarks, anti-quarks and
gluons at some ﬁnite temperature T. We can obtain partition function for
the same and thereby obtain various quantities of interest in QGP [2]. One
uses the powerful mathematical development of the consistent inclusion of the
internal symmetries ( like SU(3)c of QCD ) in a statistical thermodynamic
description of the quantum gas. This group theoretical technique ( described
in Appendix below ) has been used by other groups to project out colour
singlet representations of the QGP. This projection technique necessarily
projects out the global colour singlet states of QGP [2,4,5]. Thereby the
signiﬁcance of global colour singleteness condition on QGP was pointed out
by the authors [2,4,5,6]. They studied the ratio of the colour singlet projected
to the non-projected energy of the QGP. This is plotted as a function of T V 1/3
(see Figure 1 for this plus other aspects to be discussed below). At high T V 1/3
values the two states, the colour singlet projected and the non-projected, are
degenerate. At smaller T V 1/3 there is a drop oﬀ ( as in a phase transition )
of the colour singlet states. The physical interpretations are given elsewhere
[2,4,5,6]. Here our main intention is to study the degeneracy at high T V 1/3
and the sudden drop oﬀ of the singlet states at small T V 1/3.

All this was for the ”global” colour singlet states. A couple of years ago we
studied this problem in detail. Suppose globally the QGP could be in some
coloured state? How will this manifest itself? The same group theoretical
technique ( see Appendix ) was powerful enough to impose ”global” colour
representations like the 8-plet, the 27-plet etc. These were studied by us
sometime ago [7] and for the sake of completeness and clarity a similar plot
is reproduced here as Figure 1. Again the ratio of diﬀerent colour states is
plotted. The result and discussion has already been presented by us earlier
[7]. Here we would like to re-analyze the information in the light of the
’strong’ and the ’weak’ conﬁnement conditions. This will allow us to extract
further deep physics not perceived earlier [7].

Note that all this was done for total baryon number zero. Others have
tried to incorporate additional explicit baryon number [8,9] to project colour
singlet states. They could do so only by extending the group to U(1)A
and that too for the colour unprojected and the colour singlet states only.
The point to note is that inclusion of an explicit baryon excess necessitates
the enlargement of the QCD group. But this is actually going beyond QCD.
As we wish to stick to the QCD SU(3)c group we ﬁnd that there is no way
that one can have baryon excess in the QGP of SU(3)c

Note from Fig.1 that all the lines converge and merge at high T V 1/3. This
means that for large values of T V 1/3 all representations: singlet, octet, 27-
plet etc are degenerate with the unprojected energy ( here the 27-plet state is
not shown but has similar behaviour ). For suﬃciently large QGP and suﬃ-
ciently high temperatures all the energies of all the representations are found
to be degenerate. Globally there is nothing which favours the colour-singlet
representation over the colour-octet at high temperatures. Note that this re-
sult could directly be seen from the expression Z(p,q) which for the continuum
approximation for suﬃciently large volume and temperature becomes inde-
pendent of representation [7]. Hence energies for each colour representation
are degenerate with each other for large T V 1/3.

Thus we ﬁnd that the ’weak’ conﬁnement hypothesis is incorrect. The
QGP can be any colour representation globally and these are all degenerate.
So QGP can be in all or any of these colour representations globally. Colour
singlet at large T V 1/3 is not favoured. Now this large ( ∼ 10 − 20 fm ) region
attained in heavy ion collisions at about 200 Mev would condense to ∼ 1f m
size colour singlet objects as the system cools. So as such it should be seen to
demonstrate conﬁnement in QCD. Various coloured representations coexist
at high temperatures globally in QGP. So in this phase the quarks and glu-
ons in QGP are deconﬁned. As temperature drops ’local’ colour conﬁnement
of size of ∼ 1f m takes place. So the local colour conﬁnement is a result of
coloured particles in thermodynamic equilibrium at high temperature under-
going phase transition at a lower temperature. Conﬁnement means nothing
more than a clear preference for quark and gluons to choose colour singlet
representation over other colour representations in a size of ∼ 1 fm. In fact
we showed that the colour octet and the colour 27-plet move upto inﬁnite
energies as the temperature drops [7]. This thus is a proof of colour conﬁne-
ment in QCD. In the early universe when the system was hot the QGP soup
was globally in no speciﬁc colour state. As the system cooled and the QCD
phase transition took place, it created small ( ∼ 1 − 2 fm ) size colour singlet
objects. This is what we see at present as colour singlet hadrons. This is our
proof of colour conﬁnement in QCD!

So as per the QGP scenario above, there was no baryon number in the
early universe. But today we know that baryon number dominates in the
universe. The fact, that there are no antibaryon present in any signiﬁcant
number in the universe now, is referred to as the baryon asymmetry problem.
So if as per the above scenario the early universe had no baryon then where

5

did the baryon number come from? Below we shall show that the phase
transition itself which demonstrates ”strong” colour conﬁnement also leads
to creation of baryons. We shall see below that this is a baryon number
violating phase transition.

Fig.1 shows that the colour representation of states: (0,0)-singlet, (1,1)-
octet, (2,2)-27plot are degenerate at high T V 1/3 value. This holds for all
ﬂavours: 0-f, 2-f and 3-f cases. Now the zero ﬂavour case is the pure SU(3)c
gauge case where only gluons are present. These correspond to the self
conjugate Young diagrams (0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3) etc and hence are ”real”. As
the 2-f and 3- f cases are also degenerate with this at high T V 1/3 it implies
that all the states whether colour singlet or not, whether they contain quarks
and antiquarks or not, necessarily correspond to the ”real” representations.
This guarantee of the reality of all relevant representatives is signiﬁcant.
Notice in Fig.1 that at lower values of T V 1/3 the 0-f case decouples from
the ﬁnite quark ﬂavour cases as the singlet for these drop down in a phase
transition. Note that in the 0-f case the colour singlet state is guaranteed
to be ”real”. But as the 2-f, 3-f cases drop down and they are decoupled
from the 0-f case. Hence these are not necessarily restricted by this reality
requirement any more. However the B=0 case is ”real” anyway. But the q − ¯q
and gluons are all intermixed to give a colour singlet state. Remember that
our quarks are ”current” quarks however, now intermixed in a sea of gluons.
As such they are very much looking like the constituent quarks at low T V 1/3.
This picture of constituent quarks arising from a sea of quarks-antiquarks and
gluons [10] will be sharpened below.

The colour-singlet objects that emerge at small T V 1/3 in our picture will

consist of a large number of boxes given symbolically as below.

With the constituent quarks in colour singlet state one requires only

So constituent quarks are basically built from three boxes in a single col-

6

(1)

(2)

umn in SU(3)c. So when considering single boxes ( representing constituent
quarks ) as above in eq. (2), we are basically not presenting all the other
left out boxes. So a large number of colour singlet states made up of cur-
rent quarks and antiquarks and gluons and consisting of a large number of
columns of three boxes stand for the sea of the constituent objects in our
picture.

Before proceeding any further the physical signiﬁcance of the methodol-
ogy used in our projection technique should be emphasized. At relativistic
energies as the number of particles is not conserved hence the concept of
canonical distribution should be modiﬁed. The canonical distribution is no
longer related to the ﬁxed number of particles but rather to the given irre-
ducible representation of the symmetry group - in our case here the SU(3)c
QCD representations [4,2 p. 94]. Hence colour conﬁnement in the form of
colour singletness in the SU(3)c space of QCD is the primary determining
factor as to what happens and what does not happen here. Particle number
is not conserved here. What is conserved is the representation. This has
immediate important implications for our results here.

The colour singlet state in a single column for B=0 case consists of a
constituent quark and an antiquark state. In the colour space SU(3)c the
antiquark is represented by the Young diagram

(3)

For the antiquark this Young digram also provides the baryon number
B=-1/3. Hence colour singlet state would represent as per discussion above
a constituent quark and a constituent antiquark to form a colour singlet
meson. This corresponds to a ”real” representation.

However the same two box Young diagram also stands for baryon number
B=2/3 for a diquark. This is permitted as per the discussion above. Hence
this diquark state would then along with another constituent quark create
a baryon number B=1 state. Hence because of the dominance of the colour
singlet state at low T V 1/3 baryon number violating phase transition can take
place. Now this B=1 Young diagram corresponds to a spinor representation.
Note that at the same time real representation is needed for the B=0 case.
The antiquark with baryon number -1/3 is a fermion while the diquark
with B=2/3 is a boson. Then these two combine with a quark in colour triplet

7

state to form states with B=0 and B=1 which are mesons and baryons re-
spectively. Hence for B=1 to emerge at low energies along with the B=0 state
it is essential that there should exist a fundamental symmetry between the
antiquark and the diquark state. This means that there should be a super-
symmetry between a ﬂavour ¯3 multiplet of antiquarks ( ¯u, ¯d, ¯s ) and a ﬂavour
¯3 multiplet of scalar diquarks ( ds-sd, us-su, ud-du ). These should form the
fundamental multiplet of the supersymmetric group SU(3/3). Indeed such a
dynamic supersymmetry between antiquarks and diquarks is well known to
exist [11]. Starting with the fundamental multiplet of the SU(3/3) supersym-
metry one then associates the pseudoscalar and the vector mesons with the
octet and the decuptet of baryons in a single supermultiplet of the supersym-
metric algebra SU(6/21). Here the quarks belong to a 6-plet of SU(6) and the
diquarks to the 21-plet [12,13,14]. This supersymmetry between B=0 and
B=1 states has been well studied [11,12,13,14,15]. It is this supersymmetry
which ensures that in our model the baryon number is generated at small
T V 1/3 from a system which was baryonless at higher values.

As an additional point our model of hadrons at low temperatures is rem-
iniscent of the statistical model for hadrons [16] and provides a justiﬁcation
for the same. Also as diquarks seem to be playing a fundamental role in the
structure of hadrons, it may be an indication of deformation of nucleons [17].
On the basis of what has been said a constituent quark would be one which
is represented by a single box. Implicit is the fact that we have not shown
attached to it a series of a large number of three column boxes representing
the sea of quark- antiquarks and gluon in a colour singlet state. So also for
antiquark and diquark with a column of two boxes. In fact a gluon in the
octet state (1,1) may also become a constituent gluon by virtue of the fact
that it does have a minimum in Fig. 1. But that can happen only at higher
T V 1/3 values. In fact all the self conjugate representation (2,2), (3,3) may, if
allowed by the dynamics as represented in Fig 1, become constituent objects.
However for the colour singlet case, as the supersymmety SU(3/3) works at
the level of a single antiquark and diquark, single column constituitiveness
is all that may arise. That is we cannot associate constituent character with
colour singlet object with two columns at low T V 1/3. With the colour singlet
state arising in the 0-ﬂavour case we have just one complete composite state
which cannot be broken into any sub-constituent parts.

It is possible that in the early universe there were regions free of quarks
and antiquarks and were populated entirely by gluons. Phase transition in

8

that region would have led to colour singlet glueballs. As there are no quarks
and antiquarks present this 0-f glueball will not participate in electromagnetic
and weak interactions. These glueballs may however interact gravitationally
with each other to create a larger cluster of glueballs. Also they will not
interact with other baryons and mesons because as discussed above their
”intrinsic” constituent characteristics are so very diﬀerent. As these glue-
balls do not have any quarks, quark exchange force with other hadrons is not
possible. Also gluon exchange with other hadrons not possible as this con-
stituent glueball would by emitting a current gluon ﬂuctuate to constituent
glueball octet state, which can exist only at high T V 1/3. In fact as per Fig.
1 ( and [7] ) the 0-f glueball had decoupled very strongly from the ﬂavour
singlet cases and had a sharper and deeper drop. So given an opportunity
the glueball colour singlet clustering would dominate. Ideally speaking the
only interaction these glueballs shall partake in is the gravitational interac-
tion. So as such these are ideal candidates for the Dark Matter of cosmology.
So QCD itself ( without invoking any exotic extensions of the the Standard
Model ) is capable of explaining the problem of DM. In fact a couple of years
ago [18] the the author had looked at the possibility of the octet represen-
tations of the glueball in QCD as a DM candidate. Now that picture can
be further justiﬁed as on the basis of the above discussion these may act as
constituent gluons [18] but at higher T V 1/3. At lower values it is this new
picture which may dominate. Also our picture can explain as to why it is
so hard to produce glueballs in the laboratory. This has to do with the fact
in the Heavy Ion Collisions it is not possible to
that in the laboratory e.g.
create any substantial quark-antiquark free region.

Hybrids are made up of ( q ¯qg ) conﬁguration. Exotics like these have
not been created in the laboratory so far. To form this exotic, say (q ¯q)
subsystem would have to be in colour octet state which along with the gluon
octet would produce a colour singlet state. But both these representations
are suppressed at low T V 1/3 in our picture. Hence it would be hard to
produce it in the laboratory. But in Fig.1 note that in both these cases
there is indeed a minimum at higher T V 1/3 values. Thus it may be possible
to produce hybrids at higher temperatures and also as these may appear as
”constituent” particles there. We have already predicted existence of hybrids
as a possible signature of QGP at higher temperatures [19]. The reluctance
of other exotics to show up in the laboratory can easily be explained in our
model. So diquonia (q ¯q)(q ¯q) to exist as a single composite would require

9

each quark-antiquark pair for example to be in an octet state. But such
representations are suppressed in our picture and these hybrids would not be
produced in the laboratory.

The above was true for the QGP in the early universe scenarios. What
does this new perspective prove for the experiments conducted in the labo-
ratory. As per our picture if we start with two heavy ions each with their
baryon numbers A, A’ then when they collide and form QGP then in this
phase the baryon numbers will disappear. Thus in the QGP here too baryon
numbers will disappear. In this phase the system will globally exist in any
arbitrary colour representations. The QGP would be conﬁned in a ﬁnite size
of ∼ 10 − 20 fm for a short period due to the dynamics of the collision. As
the system cools baryons would be regenerated and due to (global) baryon
number conservation and due to the forward and the backward current con-
servation at suﬃciently higher energies the same baryons would continue to
move out. This will happen as the other colour singlet hadrons with overall
B=0 would be leaking out all over. And this is exactly what is seen in heavy
ion collisions! Hence our picture is vindicated.

Note that as per our model indeed QGP has already been formed in the
laboratory. Baryonlessness of the same is a signal for the formation of QGP.
Our model can be interpreted in the framework of the ”cold plasma” sug-
gested sometime ago [20]. We feel that the 2-10 GeV/nucleon collisions in
the centre of mass as observed by the PLASTIC ball detector [21 p. 108,110]
has already observed the QGP in the laboratory. At higher energies the so
called ”nuclear transparency” is a post QGP phase wherein as per the con-
servation of the baryonic currents one sees the baryons continuing to move
forward and backward. There is no transparency really. In the QGP phase
the whole system had lost all baryon number and it got generated later on
in the cooling phase. Also the so called ’colour transparency’ observed in
p-p and pA collisions should be naturally explained in terms of our picture
here. The regions of high multiplicity ﬂuctuations in hadron-hadron collision
are regions where QGP with B=0 are formed. The proton number continues
through, so to say, as it melts its way through the hadrons. Detailed calcu-
lations shall have to be done to consolidate this new understanding of these
eﬀects. In this paper the aim has been to show the power of the methodol-
ogy adopted to explain and correlate several puzzling eﬀects and phenomena
in hadronic physics within a consistent and coherent picture arising from a
proper understanding of conﬁnement in QCD.

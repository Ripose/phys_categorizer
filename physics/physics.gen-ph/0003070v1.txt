Summary of:

New Hierarchic Theory of Condensed Matter

by: A. Kaivarainen

A basically new hierarchic quantitative theory, general for solids

and liquids, has been developed.

It is assumed, that unharmonic oscillations of particles in any con-
densed matter lead to emergence of three-dimensional (3D) superpo-
sition of standing de Broglie waves of molecules, electromagnetic and
acoustic waves. Consequently, any condensed matter could be con-
sidered as a gas of 3D standing waves of corresponding nature. Our
approach uniﬁes and develops strongly the Einstein’s and Debye’s
models.

Collective excitations, like 3D standing de Broglie waves of molecules,

representing at certain conditions the molecular mesoscopic Bose con-
densate, were analyzed, as a background of hierarchic model of con-
densed matter.

The most probable de Broglie wave (wave B) length is deter-
mined by the ratio of Plank constant to the most probable impulse
of molecules, or by ratio of its most probable phase velocity to fre-
quency. The waves B are related to molecular translations (tr) and
librations (lb).

As the quantum dynamics of condensed matter does not follow in general
case the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the real most probable de
Broglie wave length can exceed the classical thermal de Broglie wave length and
the distance between centers of molecules many times.

This makes possible the atomic and molecular Bose condensation in solids
and liquids at temperatures, below boiling point. It is one of the most important
results of new theory, which we have conﬁrmed by computer simulations on
examples of water and ice.

Four strongly interrelated new types of quasiparticles (collective excita-

tions) were introduced in our hierarchic model:

1. Eﬀectons (tr and lb), existing in ”acoustic” (a) and ”optic” (b) states

represent the coherent clusters in general case;

2. Convertons, corresponding to interconversions between tr and lb types of

the eﬀectons (ﬂickering clusters);

2

3. Transitons are the intermediate [a ⇋ b] transition states of the tr and lb

eﬀectons;

4. Deformons are the 3D superposition of IR electromagnetic or acoustic

waves, activated by transitons and convertons.

Primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are formed by 3D superposition of the
most probable standing de Broglie waves of the oscillating ions, atoms or
molecules. The volume of eﬀectons (tr and lb) may contain from less than one,
to tens and even thousands of molecules. The ﬁrst condition means validity
of classical approximation in description of the subsystems of the eﬀectons.
The second one points to quantum properties of coherent clusters due to
molecular Bose condensation.

The liquids are semiclassical systems because their primary (tr) eﬀectons
contain less than one molecule and primary (lb) eﬀectons - more than one
molecule. The solids are quantum systems totally because both kind of their
primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are molecular Bose condensates. These conse-
quences of our theory are conﬁrmed by computer calculations.

The 1st order [gas → liquid] transition is accompanied by strong decreasing
of rotational (librational) degrees of freedom due to emergence of primary (lb)
eﬀectons and [liquid → solid] transition - by decreasing of translational degrees
of freedom due to Bose-condensation of primary (tr) eﬀectons.

In the general case the eﬀecton can be approximated by par-
allelepiped with edges corresponding to de Broglie waves length in
three selected directions (1, 2, 3), related to the symmetry of the
molecular dynamics. In the case of isotropic molecular motion the
eﬀectons’ shape may be approximated by cube.

The edge-length of primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) can be considered

as the ”parameter of order”.

The in-phase oscillations of molecules in the eﬀectons correspond to the
eﬀecton’s (a) - acoustic state and the counterphase oscillations correspond to
their (b) - optic state. States (a) and (b) of the eﬀectons diﬀer in potential
energy only, however, their kinetic energies, impulses and spatial dimensions -
are the same. The b-state of the eﬀectons has a common feature with Fr¨olich’s
polar mode.

The (a → b) or (b → a) transition states of the primary eﬀectons
(tr and lb), deﬁned as primary transitons, are accompanied by a
change in molecule polarizability and dipole moment without density
ﬂuctuations. At this case they lead to absorption or radiation of IR
photons, respectively.

Superposition (interception) of three internal standing IR pho-
tons of diﬀerent directions (1,2,3) - forms primary electromagnetic
deformons (tr and lb).

On the other hand, the [lb⇋ tr] convertons and secondary transitons are
accompanied by the density ﬂuctuations, leading to absorption or radiation of
phonons.

3

Superposition resulting from interception of standing phonons in three direc-

tions (1,2,3), forms secondary acoustic deformons (tr and lb).

Correlated collective excitations of primary and secondary eﬀectons and
deformons (tr and lb), localized in the volume of primary tr and lb electromag-
netic deformons, lead to origination of macroeﬀectons, macrotransitons
and macrodeformons (tr and lb respectively).

Correlated simultaneous excitations of tr and lb macroeﬀectons in the vol-
ume of superimposed tr and lb electromagnetic deformons lead to origination
of supereﬀectons.

In turn, the coherent excitation of both:

tr and lb macrodeformons and
macroconvertons in the same volume means creation of superdeformons. Su-
perdeformons are the biggest (cavitational) ﬂuctuations, leading to microbub-
bles in liquids and to local defects in solids.

Total number of quasiparticles of condensed matter equal to 4!=24,
reﬂects all of possible combinations of the four basic ones [1-4], intro-
duced above. This set of collective excitations in the form of ”gas” of
3D standing waves of three types: de Broglie, acoustic and electro-
magnetic - is shown to be able to explain virtually all the properties
of all condensed matter.

The important positive feature of our hierarchic model of matter is that it
does not need the semi-empiric intermolecular potentials for calculations, which
are unavoidable in existing theories of many body systems. The potential energy
of intermolecular interaction is involved indirectly in dimensions and stability
of quasiparticles, introduced in our model.

The main formulae of theory are the same for liquids and solids
and include following experimental parameters, which take into ac-
count their diﬀerent properties:

[1]- Positions of (tr) and (lb) bands in oscillatory spectra;
[2]- Sound velocity;
[3]- Density;
[4]- Refraction index (extrapolated to the inﬁnitive wave length of

photon).

The knowledge of these four basic parameters at the same temperature and
pressure makes it possible using our computer program, to evaluate more than
300 important characteristics of any condensed matter. Among them are such
as: total internal energy, kinetic and potential energies, heat-capacity and ther-
mal conductivity, surface tension, vapor pressure, viscosity, coeﬃcient of self-
diﬀusion, osmotic pressure, solvent activity, etc. Most of calculated parameters
are hidden, i.e. inaccessible to direct experimental measurement.

The new interpretation and evaluation of Brillouin light scattering and
M¨ossbauer eﬀect parameters may also be done on the basis of hierarchic the-
ory. Mesoscopic scenarios of turbulence, superconductivity and superﬂuity are
elaborated.

Some original aspects of water in organization and large-scale dynamics of
biosystems - such as proteins, DNA, microtubules, membranes and regulative

4

role of water in cytoplasm, cancer development, quantum neurodynamics, etc.
have been analyzed in the framework of Hierarchic theory.

Computerized veriﬁcation of our Hierarchic concept of matter on
examples of water and ice is performed, using special computer pro-
gram: Comprehensive Analyzer of Matter Properties (CAMP, copy-
right, 1997, Kaivarainen). The new opto-acoustical device (CAMP),
based on this program, with possibilities much wider, than that of
IR, Raman and Brillouin spectrometers, has been proposed

(see URL: http://www.karelia.ru/˜alexk).
This is the ﬁrst theory able to predict all known experimental
temperature anomalies for water and ice. The conformity between
theory and experiment is very good even without any adjustable pa-
rameters.

The hierarchic concept creates a bridge between micro- and macro-
liquids and solids in

phenomena, dynamics and thermodynamics,
terms of quantum physics.

1: New approach to theory of light refraction

1.1. Refraction in gas

If the action of photons onto electrons of molecules is considered
as a force, activating a harmonic oscillator with decay, it leads to
the known classical equations for a complex refraction index (Vuks,
1984).

The Lorentz-Lorenz formula obtained in such a way is convenient
for practical needs. However, it does not describe the dependence
of refraction index on the incident light frequency and did not take
into account the intermolecular interactions. In the new theory pro-
posed below we have tried to clear up the relationship between these
parameters.

Our basic idea is that the dielectric penetrability of matter ǫ,
(equal in the optical interval of frequencies to the refraction index
squared n2), is determined by the ratio of partial volume energies of
photon in vacuum to similar volume energy of photon in matter:

ǫ = n2 =

[E0
p]
[Em
p ]

=

mpc2
mpc2
m

=

c2
c2
m

(1.1)

where mp = hνp/c2 is the eﬀective photon mass, c is the light velocity in

vacuum, cm is the eﬀective light velocity in matter.

We introduce the notion of partial volume energy of a photon
in vacuum [E0
p ] as a product of photon energy
(Ep = hνp) and the volume (Vp) occupied by 3D standing wave of
photon in vacuum and in matter, correspondingly:

p ] and in matter [Em

[E0

p] = EpV 0
p

[Em

p ] = EpV m
p

(1.2)

The 3D standing photon volume as an interception volume of 3 diﬀerent
standing photons normal to each other was termed in our mesoscopic model as
a primary electromagnetic deformon (see Introduction of [1,2,3]).

In vacuum, where the eﬀect of an excluded volume due to the spatial
incompatibility of electron shells of molecules and photon is absent,
the volume of 3D photon standing wave (primary deformon) is:

V 0
p =

1
np

=

3λ2
p
8π

(1.3)

We will consider the interaction of light with matter in this meso-
scopic volume, containing a thousands of molecules of condensed mat-
ter. It is the reason why we titled this theory of light refraction as
mesoscopic one.

6

Putting (1.3) into (1.2), we obtain the formula for the partial volume energy

of a photon in vacuum:

[E0

p] = EpV 0

p = hνp

9λ2
p

(1.4)

Then we proceed from the assumption that waves B of photons can not
exist with waves B of electrons, forming the shells of atoms and molecules in
the same space elements. Hence, the eﬀect of excluded volume appears during
the propagation of an external electromagnetic wave through the matter.
It
leads to the fact that in matter the volume occupied by a photon, is equal to

p = V 0

In the absence of the polarization by the external ﬁeld and intermolecular in-

where Le is the radius of the most probable wave B (Le = λe/2π) of the outer
electron of a molecule. As it has been shown in (7.5) that the mean molecule
polarizability is:

α = L3
e

(1.8)

Then taking (1.7) and (1.6) into account, the excluded volume of primary elec-
tromagnetic deformon in the matter is:

Therefore, the partial volume energy of a photon in the vacuum is determined
by eq.(1.4), while that in matter, according to (1.5):

where: nM = N0/V0 is a concentration of molecules;

In this equation α = L3

e is the average static polarizability of
molecules for the case when the external electromagnetic ﬁelds as
well as intermolecular interactions inducing the additional polariza-
tion are absent. This situation is realized at Ep = hνp → 0 and λp → ∞
in the gas phase. As will be shown below the value of resulting α∗ in
condensed matter is bigger.

1.2. Light refraction in liquids and solids

According to the Lorentz classical theory, the electric component of the outer
electromagnetic ﬁeld is ampliﬁed by the additional inner ﬁeld (Ead), related to
the interaction of induced dipole moments in composition of condensed matter
with each other:

Ead =

n2 − 1

3

E

8

(1.15)

The mean Lorentz acting ﬁeld ¯F can be expressed as:

F = E + Ead =

n2 + 2

3

E (at n → 1, F → E)

(1.16)

¯F - has a dimensions of electric ﬁeld tension and tends to E in the gas phase

when n → 1.

In accordance with our mesoscopic model, except the Lorentz act-
ing ﬁeld, the total internal acting ﬁeld, includes also two another con-
tributions, increasing the molecules polarizability (α) in condensed
matter:

1. Potential intermolecular ﬁeld, including all the types of Van-
der-Waals interactions in composition of coherent collective excita-
tions, even without external electromagnetic ﬁeld. Like total po-
tential energy of matter, this contribution must be dependent on
temperature and pressure;

2. Primary internal ﬁeld, related with primary electromagnetic
deformons (tr and lib). This component of the total acting ﬁeld also
exist without external ﬁelds. Its frequencies corresponds to IR range
and its action is much weaker than the action of the external visible
light.

Let us try to estimate the energy of the total acting ﬁeld and its eﬀective

frequency (νf ) and wavelength (λf ), that we introduce as:

Af = hνf =

hc
λf

= AL + AV + AD

(1.17)

where: AL, AV and AD are contributions, related with Lorentz ﬁeld, po-

tential ﬁeld and primary deformons ﬁeld correspondingly.

When the interaction energy of the molecule with a photon (Ep = hνp)
is less than the energy of the resonance absorption, then it leads to elastic
polarization of the electron shell and origination of secondary photons, i.e. light
scattering. We assume in our consideration that the increment of polarization of
a molecule (α) under the action of the external photon (hνp) and the total active
ﬁeld (Af = hνf ) can be expressed through the increase of the most probable
radius of the electron’s shell (Le = α1/3), using our (eq. 7.6 from [1]):

∆Le =

ωp me

2

α

(1.18)

where the resulting increment:

∆L∗ = ∆Le + ∆Lf =

(hνp + Af )me

22

α

(1.18a)

9

where: α = L3

e is the average polarizability of molecule in gas phase at νf →

0.

For water molecule in the gas phase:

Le = α1/3 = 1.13 · 10−10 m

is a known constant, determined experimentally [4].

The total increment of polarizability radius (∆L∗) and resulting
polarizability of molecules (α∗) in composition of condensed matter
aﬀected by the acting ﬁeld

α∗ = (L∗)3

can be ﬁnd from the experimental refraction index (n) using our
formula (1.14):

L∗ =(cid:20) 3

n2 − 1

n2 (cid:21)1/3

∆L∗ = L∗ − Le

where: L∗ = (α∗)1/3

(1.19)

(1.20)

From (1.18) we get a formula for the increment of radius of polarizability (∆Lf ),
induced by the total internal acting ﬁeld:

∆Lf = ∆L∗ − ∆Le =

Af · me
22 α

(1.21)

Like total internal acting ﬁeld energy (1.17), this total acting increment
can be presented as a sum of contributions, related to Lorentz ﬁeld (∆LF ),
potential ﬁeld (∆LV ) and primary deformons ﬁeld (∆LD):

∆Lf = ∆LL + ∆LV + ∆LD

(1.22)

Increment ∆Le, induced by external photon only, can be calculated from the
known frequency (νp) of the incident light (see 1.18a):

∆Le =

hνp · me
22 α

(1.23)

It means that ∆Lf can be found from (1.21) and (1.17), using (1.23). Then
from (1.21) we can calculate the energy (Af ), eﬀective frequency (νf ) and wave
length (λf ) of the total acting ﬁeld like:

10

Af = hνf = hc/λf = 2

∆Lf · 2

The computer calculations of α∗; L∗ = Le + ∆L∗ = (α∗)1/3 and Af
temperature range (0 − 950) are presented on Fig.1.1.

in the

One must keep in mind that in general case α and L are tensors. It means
that all the increments, calculated on the base of eq.(1.18a) must be considered
as the eﬀective ones. Nevertheless, it is obvious that our approach to analysis
of the acting ﬁeld parameters can give useful additional information about the
properties of transparent condensed matter.

Fig. 1.1. (a)- Temperature dependencies of the most probable
outer electron shell radius of H2O (L∗) and the eﬀective polarizabil-
ity α∗ = (L∗)3 in the total acting ﬁeld;

(b)- Temperature dependence of the total acting ﬁeld (Af ) en-
ergy in water at the wavelength of the incident light λp = 5.461 ·
10−5cm−1. The experimental data for refraction index n(t) were
used in calculations. The initial electron shell radius is: Le =
α1/3
H2O = 1.13 · 10−8cm [4].
In graphical calculations in Fig.1.1a,
the used experimental temperature dependence of the water refrac-
tion index were obtained by Frontas’ev and Schreiber [5].

The temperature dependencies of these parameters were com-
puted using the known experimental data on refraction index n(t)
for water and presented in Fig.1.1a. The radius L∗ in the range
0−950C increases less than by 1% at constant incident light wavelength
(λ = 546.1nm). The change of ∆Lf with temperature is determined by
its potential ﬁeld component change ∆LV .

11

The relative change of this component: ∆∆LV /∆Lf (t = 00C) is
about 9%. Corresponding to this change the increasing of the acting
ﬁeld energy Af (eq.1.23) increases approximately by 8 kJ/M (Fig 1.1
b) due to its potential ﬁeld contribution.

It is important that the total potential energy of water in the
same temperature range, according to our calculations, increase by
the same magnitude (Fig.5b in [1] or Fig.3b in [ 3]). This fact points
to the strong correlation between potential intermolecular interaction
in matter and the value of the acting ﬁeld energy.

It was calculated that, at constant temperature (200) the energy
of the acting ﬁeld (Af ), (eq.1.23) in water practically does not depend
on the wavelength of incident light (λp). At more than three time
from 12.56 · 10−5cm to 3.03 · 10−5cm and the water
alterations of λp:
refraction index (n) from 1.320999 to 1.358100 [6] the value of Af
changes less than by 1%.

At the same conditions the electron shell radius L∗ and the acting
polarizability α∗ thereby increase from (1.45 to 1.5)·10−10 m and from
(3.05 to 3.274) · 10−30m3 respectively (Fig.1.2). These changes are due
to the incident photons action only. For water molecules in the gas
phase and λp → ∞ the initial polarizability (α = L3
e) is equal to 1.44 ·
10−24cm3 [4], i.e. signiﬁcantly less than in condensed matter under
the action of external and internal ﬁelds.

Obviously, the temperature change of energy Af (Fig.1.1b) is de-
termined by the internal pressure increasing (section 11.2 of [1]), re-
lated to intermolecular interaction change, depending on mean dis-
tances between molecules and, hence, on the concentration (N0/V0) of
molecules in condensed matter.

12

Fig. 1.2. Dependencies of the acting polarizability α∗ = (L∗)3
and electron shell radius of water in the acting ﬁeld (L∗) on incident
light wavelength (λp), calculated from eq. (1.14) and experimental
data n(λp) [6]. The initial polarizability of H2O in the gas phase at
λp → ∞ is equal to α = L3
e = 1.44 · 10−24cm3. The corresponding
initial radius of the H2O electron shell is Le = 1.13 · 10−8cm.

On the basis of our data, changes of Af , calculated from (1.24)
are caused mainly by the heat expansion of the matter. The photon
induced increment of the polarizability (α → α∗) practically do not
change Af .

The ability to obtain new valuable information about changes of
molecule polarizability under the action of incident light and about
temperature dependent molecular interaction in condensed medium
markedly reinforce such a widely used method as refractometry.

The above deﬁned relationship between the molecule polarizabil-
ity and the wave length of the incident light allows to make a new
endeavor to solve the light scattering problems.

2. Mesoscopic theory of Brillouin light scattering in

condensed matter

2.1. Traditional approach

According to traditional concept, light scattering in liquids and crystals as
well as in gases takes place due to random heat ﬂuctuations. In condensed media
the ﬂuctuations of density, temperature and molecule orientation are possible.
Density (ρ) ﬂuctuations leading to dielectric penetrability (ǫ) ﬂuctuations
are of major importance. This contribution is estimated by means of Einstein
formula for scattering coeﬃcient of liquids [7]:

R =

I0V

2λ4 kT βT (cid:18)ρ

∂ρ(cid:19)T

(2.1)

where βT is isothermal compressibility.
Many authors made attempts to ﬁnd a correct expression for the variable
∂ρ ).
The formula derived by Vuks [8, 9] is most consistent with experimental

(ρ ∂ǫ

data:

2.2. Fine structure of scattering

The ﬁne structure - spectrum of the scattering in liquids is represented by
two Brillouin components with frequencies shifted relatively from the incident
light frequency: ν± = ν0 ± ∆ν and one unshifted band like in gases (ν0).

The shift of the Brillouin components is caused by the Doppler eﬀect result-
ing from a fraction of photons scattering on phonons moving at sound speed in
two opposite directions [8].

This shift can be explained in diﬀerent way as well. If in the antinodes of

the standing wave the density oscillation occurs at frequency (Ω):

ρ = ρ0 cos Ωt,

(2.3)

then the scattered wave amplitude will change at the same frequency. Such a
wave can be represented as a superposition of two monochromatic waves having
the frequencies:(ω + Ω) and (ω − Ω), where

Ω = 2πf

(2.4)

is the elastic wave frequency at which scattering occurs when the Wolf-Bragg

respectively); ϕ is the angle of sliding; θ is the angle of scattering; n is the

(2.9)

According to the classical theory, the central line, which is analogous to
that observed in gases, is caused by entropy ﬂuctuations in liquids, without
any changes of pressure [8]. On the basis of Frenkel theory of liquid state, the
central line can be explained by ﬂuctuations of ”hole” number - cavitational
ﬂuctuations [10].

The thermodynamic approach of Landau and Plachek leads to the formula,
which relates the intensities of the central (I) and two lateral (IM −B) lines of
the scattering spectrum with compressibility and heat capacities:

I

2IM −B

=

Ip
Iad

=

βT − βS

βS

=

Cp − Cv

Cv

(2.10)

where: βT and βS are isothermal and adiabatic compressibilities; Cp and Cv
are isobaric and isohoric heat capacities.

In crystals, quartz for example, the central line in the ﬁne structure of light
scattering is usually absent or very small. However, instead of one pair of shifted
components, observed in liquids, there appear three Brillouin components in
crystals. One of them used to be explained by scattering on the longitudinal
phonons, and two - by scattering on the transversal phonons.

2.3. New mesoscopic approach to problem

In our hierarchic theory the thermal ”random” ﬂuctuations are
”organized” by diﬀerent types of superimposed quantum excitations.
According to our Hierarchic model, including microscopic, meso-
scopic and macroscopic scales of matter (see Introduction of [1,2,3]),
the most probable (primary) and mean (secondary) eﬀectons, trans-
lational and librational are capable of quantum transitions between
two discreet states: (a ⇔ b)tr,lb and (¯a ⇔ ¯b)tr,lb respectively. These
transitions lead to origination/annihilation of photons and phonons,
forming primary and secondary deformons.

The mean heat energy of molecules is determined by the value
of 3kT, which as our calculations show, has the intermediate value
between the discreet energies of a and b quantum states of primary
eﬀectons (Fig.19 of [1]), making, consequently, the non equilibrium
conditions in condensed matter. Such kind of instability is a result of
”competition” between classical and quantum distributions of energy
.

15

The maximum deviations from thermal equilibrium and that of the dielec-
tric properties of matter occur when the same states of primary and secondary
quasiparticles, e.g. a,¯a and b,¯b occur simultaneously. Such a situation corre-
sponds to the A and B states of macroeﬀectons. The (A ⇔ B)tr,lb transitions
represent thermal ﬂuctuations. The big density ﬂuctuations are related to ”ﬂick-
ering clusters” (macroconvertions between librational and translational primary
eﬀectons) and the maximum ﬂuctuations correspond to Superdeformons.

Only in the case of spatially independent ﬂuctuations the inter-
ference of secondary scattered photons does not lead to their total
compensation.

The probability of the event that two spatially uncorrelated events coincide

in time is equal to the product of their independent probabilities [10].

Thus, the probabilities of the coherent (a,¯a) and (b,¯b) states of primary and
secondary eﬀectons, corresponding to A and B states of the macroeﬀectons (tr
and lib), independent on each other, are equal to:

ef

Z is the sum of probabilities of all types of quasiparticles states - eq.(4.2 of

translational and librational macrodeformons are expressed as the products
(2.11) and (2.12):

where: α∗ is the acting polarizability determined by eq.(1.24) and (1.25).

The resulting coeﬃcient of the isotropic scattering (Riso) is deﬁned as the
sum of contributions (2.21-2.23) and is subdivided into three kinds of scattering:
caused by translational quasiparticles, caused by librational quasiparticles and
by the mixed type of quasiparticles:

Riso = [RM

B + RM

D ] + [RM

(2.24)

Total contributions, related to convertons and superexcitations are corre-

spondingly:

RC = Rac + Rbc + Rabc and RS = Rs

A + Rs

B + Rs
D

The polarizability of anisotropic molecules having no cubic symmetry is a
tensor. In this case, total scattering (R) consists of scattering at density ﬂuctua-

tions (Riso) and scattering at ﬂuctuations of the anisotropy(cid:16)Ran = 13∆

18

R = Riso +

13∆

6 − 7∆

Riso = Riso

6 + 6∆
6 − 7∆

= RisoK

(2.25)

where Riso corresponds to eq.(2.24); ∆ is the depolarization coeﬃcient.

The factor: (cid:16) 6+6∆

6−7∆(cid:17) = K was obtained by Cabanne and is called after him.

In the case of isotropic molecules when ∆ = 0, the Cabanne factor is equal to
1.

The depolarization coeﬃcient (∆) could be determined experimentally as

the ratio:

∆ = Ix/Iz,

(2.26)

where Ix and Iz are two polarized components of the beam scattered at right
angle with respect to each other in which the electric vector is directed parallel
and perpendicular to the incident beam, respectively. For example, in water
∆ = 0.09 (Vuks, 1977).

According to the proposed theory of light scattering in liquids the central un-
shifted (like in gases) component of the Brillouin scattering spectrum, is caused
by ﬂuctuations of concentration and self-diﬀusion of molecules, participating in
the convertons, macrodeformons (tr and lib) and superdeformons. The scatter-
ing coeﬃcients of the central line (Rcentr) and side lines (2Rside) in transparent
condensed matter, as follows from (2.24) and (2.25), are equal correspondingly
to:

Rcent = K(cid:2)(cid:0) RM

D (cid:1)tr +(cid:0) RM

D (cid:1)lb(cid:3) + K(RC + RS)

and

2Rside =(cid:0) RM

A + RM

B (cid:1)tr +(cid:0) RM

A + RM

A (cid:1)lb

(2.27)

(2.27a)

where K is the Cabanne factor.
The total coeﬃcient of light scattering is:

Rt = Rcent + 2Rside

(2.28)

In accordance with our model the ﬂuctuations of anisotropy (Cabanne factor)
should be taken into account for calculations of the central component only. The
orientations of molecules in composition of A and B states of Macroeﬀectons are
correlated and their coherent oscillations are not accompanied by ﬂuctuations
of anisotropy of polarizability (see Fig.2.1).

19

The probabilities of the convertons, macrodeformons and superdeformons
excitations (eqs.2.14, 4.16, 4.27 in [1]) are much lower in crystals than in liquids
and hence, the central line in the Brillouin spectra of crystals is not usually
observed.

The lateral lines in Brillouin spectra are caused by the scattering on the
molecules forming (A) and (B) states of spatially independent macroeﬀectons,
as it was mentioned above.

The polarizabilities of the molecules forming the independent macroeﬀec-
tons, synchronized in (A)tr,lb and (B)tr,lb states and dielectric properties of
these states, diﬀer from each other and from that of transition states (macrode-
formons). Such short-living states should be considered as the non equilibrium
ones.

In fact we must keep in mind, that static polarizabilities in the more stable
ground A state of the macroeﬀectons are higher than in B state, because the
energy of long-term Van der Waals interaction between molecules of the A state
is bigger than that of B-state.

If this diﬀerence may be attributed mainly to the diﬀerence in the long-therm

dispersion interaction, then from (1.33) we obtain:

EB − EA = VB − VA = −

(2.29)

fectons are the same: T A

kin.

In our present calculations of light scattering we ignore this diﬀerence (2.29)

between polarizabilities of molecules in A and B states.

But it can be taken into account if we assume, that polarizabilities in (A)

and (a), (B) and (b) states of primary eﬀectons are like:

αA ≃ αa ≃ α∗; αB ≃ αb

and the diﬀerence between the potential energy of (a) and (b) states is deter-
mined mainly by dispersion interaction (eq.2.28).

Experimental resulting polarizability (α∗ ≃ αa) can be expressed as:

αa = faαa + fbαb + ftα

(2.29a)

where αt ≃ α is polarizability of molecules in the gas state (or transition state);

(2.29b)

αb = αa − ∆αa = αa(1 − νp/νb)

where: ∆αa is a change of each molecule polarizability as a result of the
primary eﬀecton energy changing: Eb → Ea + hνp with photon radiation; νb is
a frequency of primary eﬀecton in (b)- state (eq.2.28).

Combining (2.29) and (2.29b) we derive for αa and αb of the molecules

composing primary translational or librational eﬀectons:

αa =

The calculations by means of (2.30) are approximate in the framework of our
assumptions mentioned above. But they correctly reﬂect the tendencies of αa
and αb changes with temperature.

The ratio of intensities or scattering coeﬃcients for the central component
to the lateral ones previously was described by Landau- Plachek formula (2.10).
According to our mesoscopic theory this ratio can be calculated in another way
leading from (2.27) and (2.28):

(2.30b)

Combining (2.30) and Landau- Plachek formula (2.10) it is possible to cal-

scattering.

2.4. Factors that determine the Brillouin line width

The known equation for Brillouin shift is (see 2.7):

∆νM −B = ν0 = 2

vs
λ

n sin(θ/2)

(2.31)

where: vs is the hypersonic velocity; λ is the wavelength of incident light, n is
the refraction index of matter, and θ - scattering angle.

The deviation from ν0 that determines the Brillouin side line half width may
be expressed as the result of ﬂuctuations of sound velocity vs and n related to
A and B states of tr and lib macroeﬀectons:

∆ν0

=(cid:18) ∆vs

∆n

n (cid:19)

(2.32)

∆ν0 is the most probable side line width, i.e. the true half width of Brillouin

line. It can be expressed as:

∆ν0 = ∆νexp − F ∆νinc

where ∆νexp is the half width of the experimental line, ∆νinc - the half width of
the incident line, F - the coeﬃcient that takes into account apparatus eﬀects.

Let us analyze the ﬁrst and the second terms in the right part of (2.32)

separately.

The vs squared is equal to the ratio of the compressibility modulus (K) and

density (ρ):

(2.39)

we can assume eq.(2.39) as far both parameters: polarizability (α∗) and com-
pressibility models (K) are related with the potential energy of intermolecular
interaction.

For the other hand one can suppose that the following relation is true:

∆α∗

(2.40)

where:

is the energy of an ”ideal” quasiparticle as a superposition of 3D standing waves.
The density ﬂuctuations can be estimated as a result of the free volume (vf )

ﬂuctuations (see 2.45):

obtain the semiempirical formulae for the Brillouin line half width calculation:

The traditional theory of Brillouin line shape gives a possibility for calculation

of ∆ν0 taking into account the elastic (acoustic) wave dissipation.

The fading out of acoustic wave amplitude may be expressed as:

A = A0e−αx

or A = A0e−αvs

(2.45)

where α is the extinction coeﬃcient; x = vst - the distance from the source of
waves; vs and t - sound velocity and time, correspondingly.

The hydrodynamic theory of sound propagation in liquids leads to the fol-

lowing expression for the extinction coeﬃcient:

α = αs + αb =

Ω2
2ρv3

s (cid:18) 4

ηs + ηb(cid:19)

(2.46)

where: αs and αb are contributions to α, related to share viscosity (ηs) and
bulk viscosity (ηb), respectively; Ω = 2πf is the angular frequency of acoustic
waves.

When the side lines in Brillouin spectra broaden slightly, the following rela-
tion between their intensity (I) and shift (∆ω =| ω − ω0 |) from frequency ω0,
corresponding to maximum intensity (I = I0) of side line is correct:

where:

I =

(2.47)

One can see from (2.46) that at I(ω) = I0/2, the half width:

∆ω1/2 = 2π∆ν1/2 = αvs

and ∆ν1/2 =

παvs

(2.48)

It will be shown in Chapter 12 how one can calculate the values of ηs and
consequently αs on the basis of the mesoscopic theory of viscosity.

2.5. Quantitative veriﬁcation of mesoscopic theory of

Brillouin scattering

24

The calculations made according to the formula (2.21 - 2.27) are
presented in Fig.2.1-2.7. The proposed theory of scattering in liquids,
based on our hierarchic concept, is more adequate than the traditional
Einstein, Mandelschtamm-Brillouin, Landau-Plachek theories based
on classical thermodynamics. It describes experimental temperature
dependencies and the Icentr/2IM −B ratio for water very well (Fig.2.3).
The calculations are made for the wavelength of incident light: λph =
546.1nm = 5.461 · 10−5cm. The experimental temperature dependence for
the refraction index (n) at this wavelength was taken from the Frontas’ev and
Schreiber paper (1965). The rest of data for calculating of various light scat-
tering parameters of water (density the location of translational and librational
bands in the oscillatory spectra) are identical to those used above in Chapter 6.

(eq.2.25).

(2.49)

From formula (2.48a) the resulting or eﬀective molecular polarizability

squared (α∗)2 used in eq.(2.21-2.23) is:

(α∗)2 =(cid:20) (n2 − 1)/n2

(4/3)π(N0/V0)(cid:21)2

(2.50)

On the other hand, from the Lorentz-Lorenz formula (2.49) we have another
value of polarizability:

(4/3)π(N0/V0) (cid:21)2
α2 =(cid:20) (n2 − 1)/(n2 + 2)

(2.51)

It is evident that the light scattering coeﬃcients (eq.2.28), calculated using
(2.50) and (2.51) taking refraction index: n = 1.33 should diﬀer more than four
times as far:

R(α∗)

= 4.56

(2.52)

At 250 and λph = 546nm the theoretical magnitude of the scattering
coeﬃcient for water, calculated from our formulae (2.28) is equal (see Fig.2.1)
to:

R = 11.2 · 10−5m−1

(2.53)

This result of our theory coincides well with the most reliable experimental value
(Vuks, 1977):

Rexp = 10.8 · 10−5m−1

Multiplication of the side bands contribution (2Rside) to Cabanne factor in-
creases the calculated total scattering to about 25% and makes the correspon-
dence with experiment worse. This fact conﬁrms our assumption that ﬂuctua-
tions of anisotropy of polarizability in composition of A and B states of macroef-
fectons should be ignored in light scattering evaluation due to correlation of
molecular dynamics in these states, in contrast to that of macrodeformons.

Fig. 2.5. Theoretical temperature dependencies of the contri-
butions of the A and B states of librational Macroeﬀectons to the
coeﬃcient of light scattering (R).

It follows from the Fig.2.4 and 2.5 that the light scattering depends on
(A ⇔ B) equilibrium of macroeﬀectons because (RA) > (RB), i.e. scattering
on A states is bigger than that on B states.

Fig. 2.6. Theoretical temperature dependencies of the contribu-
tions to light scattering (central component), related to translational
(RD)tr and librational (RD)lb macrodeformons.

Comparing Figs. 2.1; 2.3, and 2.6 one can see that the main contribution to
central component of light scattering is determined by [lb/tr] convertons Rc (see
eq.2.27).

29

Fig. 2.7. Theoretical temperature dependences for temperature
derivative (dR/dT ) of the total coeﬃcient of light scattering of water.

Nonmonotonic deviations of the dependencies dR/dT (Fig.2.7) reﬂect the
nonmonotonic changes of the refraction index for water nH2O(T ), as indicated
by available experimental data (Frontas’ev and Schreiber, 1965). The deviations
of dependence nH2O(t) from the monotonic way in accordance with hierarchic
theory, are a consequence of the nonmonotonic change in the stability of water
structure, i.e. nonlinear change of (A ⇔ B)tr,lb equilibrium. Some possible
reasons of such equilibrium change were discussed in Chapter 6.

It is clear from (2.52) that the calculations based on the Lorentz-
Lorentz formula (2.51) give scattering coeﬃcient values of about 4.5
times smaller than experimental ones. It means that the true α∗ value
can be calculated just on the basis of our mesoscopic theory of light
refraction (eq.2.50).

The traditional Smolukhovsky-Einstein theory, valid for the integral light
scattering only (eq. 2.1), yield values in the range of R = 8.85 · 10−5 m−1 to
R = 10.5 · 10−5 m−1 [4, 8].

All the results, discussed above, mean that our mesoscopic theory
of light scattering works better and is much more informative than
the conventional one.

2.6. Light scattering in solutions

If the guest molecules are dissolved in a liquid and their sizes are much less
than incident light wavelength, they do not radically alter the solvent properties.
For this case the described above mechanism of light scattering of pure liquids
does not changed qualitatively.

For such dilute solutions the scattering on the ﬂuctuations of concentration
of dissolved molecules (Rc) is simply added to the scattering on the density
ﬂuctuations of molecules of the host solvent (eq.2.28). Taking into account the
ﬂuctuations of molecule polarizability anisotropy (see 2.25) the total scattering
coeﬃcient of the solution (RS) is:

RS = Rt + Rc

(2.54)

Eqs. (2.21 - 2.28) could be used for calculating Rt until critical concentra-
tions (Ccr) of dissolved substance when it start to destroy the solvent structure,
so that the latter is no longer able to form primary librational eﬀectons. Pertur-
bations of solvent structure will induce low-frequency shift of librational bands
in the oscillatory spectrum of the solution until these bands totally disappear.
If the experiment is made with a two-component solution of liquids, soluble
in each other, e.g. water-alcohol, benzol-methanol etc., and the positions of
translational and librational bands of solution components are diﬀerent, then

30

at the concentration of the dissolved substance: C > Ccr, the dissolved sub-
stance and the solvent (the guest and host) can switch their roles. Then the
translational and librational bands pertinent to the guest subsystem start to
dominate. In this case, Rt is to be calculated from the positions of the new
bands corresponding to the ”new” host-solvent. The total ”melting” of the pri-
mary librational ”host eﬀectons” and the appearance of the dissolved substance
”guest eﬀectons” is like the second order phase transition and should be accom-
panied by a heat capacity jump. The like experimental eﬀects take place indeed
[8].

According to our concept, the coeﬃcient Rc in eq.(2.54) is caused by the ﬂuc-
tuations of concentration of dissolved molecules in the volume of translational
and librational macro- and superdeformons of the solvent. If the destabilization
of the solvent is expressed in the low frequency shift of librational bands,
then the coeﬃcients (RA and RB)lb increase (eq.2.21 and 2.22) with the prob-
ability of macro-excitations.. The probabilities of convertons and macro- and
superdeformons and the central component of Brillouin spectra will increase
also. Therefore, the intensity of the total light scattering increases correspond-
ingly.

The ﬂuctuations of concentration of the solute molecules, in accordance with
our model, occur in the volumes of macrodeformons and superdeformons. Con-
sequently, the contribution of solute molecules in scattering (Rc value in eq.2.54)
can be expressed by formula, similar to (2.23), but containing the molecule po-
g)2 instead of the
larizability of the dissolved substance (”guest”), equal to (α∗
molecule polarizability (α∗) of the solvent (”host”), and the molecular con-
centration of the ”guest” substance in the solution (ng) instead of the solvent
molecule concentration (nM = N0/V0). For this case Rc could be presented as
a sum of the following contributions:

(Rc)tr,lb =

8π4
λ4 (α∗

g)2ng ·h(P D

M )tr,lb + P D∗

S i

RD∗

c =

8π4
λ4 (α∗

g)2ng · (P D∗
S )

(2.55)

(2.55a)

The resulting scattering coeﬃcient (Re) on ﬂuctuations of concentration in

(2.54) is equal to:

Rc = (Rc)tr + (Rc)lb + RD∗

c

(2.56)

If several substances are dissolved with concentrations lower than (Ccr),

then their Rc are summed up additively.

Formulae (2.55) and (2.56) are valid also for the dilute solutions.
Eqs.(2.21-2.28) and (2.54-2.56) should, therefore, be used for calculating the

resulting coeﬃcient of light scattering in solutions (RS).

31

The traditional theory represents the scattering coeﬃcient at ﬂuctuations of

concentration as (Vuks, 1977):

Rc =

π2

∂x(cid:19)2
2λ4 (cid:18) ∂ǫ

∆x2v

(2.57)

where (∂ǫ/∂x) is the dielectric penetrability derivative with respect to one of
the components: ∆¯x2 is the ﬂuctuations of concentration of guest molecules
squared in the volume element v .

The transformation of (2.57) on the basis of classical thermodynamics [8]

leads to the formula:

Rc =

π2

2λ4N0 (cid:18)2n

∂n

∂x(cid:19)(cid:18)

(2.58)

where N0 is the Avogadro number, x1 and x2 are the molar fractions of the
ﬁrst and second components in the solution, V12 is the molar volume of the
solution, f
is the function of ﬂuctuations of concentration determined exper-
imentally from the partial vapor pressures of the ﬁrst (P1) and second (P2)
solution components [8]:

For application the mesoscopic theory of light scattering to study of

crystals, liquids and solutions, the following information is needed:

1. Positions of translational and librational band maxima in oscil-

latory spectra;

2. Concentration of all types of molecules in solutions;
3. Refraction index or polarizability in the acting ﬁeld of each

component of solution at given temperature.

Application of our theory to quantitative analysis of transparent
liquids and solids yields much more information about properties of
matter, its mesoscopic and hierarchic dynamic structure than the
traditional one.

3.1. General background

32

When the atomic nucleus with mass (M) in the gas phase irradiates γ-

quantum with energy of

E0 = hν0 = mpc2

(3.1)

where: mp is the eﬀective photon mass, then according to the law of impulse
conservation, the nuclear acquires additional velocity in the opposite direction:

is termed recoil energy.

When an atom which irradiates γ-quantum is in composition of the solid

body, then three situations are possible:

1. The recoil energy of the atom is higher than the energy of atom
In this case, the atom irradiating γ-quantum
- lattice interaction.
would be knocked out from its position in the lattice. That leads to
defects origination;

2. Recoil energy is insuﬃcient for the appreciable displacement of
an atom in the structure of the lattice, but is higher than the en-
ergy of phonon, equal to energy of secondary transitons and phonons
excitation. In this case, recoil energy is spent for heating the lattice;
3. Recoil energy is lower than the energy of primary transitons,
related to [emission/absorption] of IR translational and librational
photons (hνp)tr,lb and phonons (hνph)tr,lb. In that case, the probability
(f ) of γ-quantum irradiation without any the losses of energy appears,
termed the probability (fraction) of a recoilless processes.

For example, when ER << hνph (νph - the mean frequency of phonons),

then the mean energy of recoil:

Hence, the probability of recoilless eﬀect is

ER = (1 − f )hνph

f = 1 −

ER
hνph

(3.4)

(3.5)

According to eq.(3.3) the decrease of the recoil energy ER of an atom in the
structure of the lattice is related to increase of its eﬀective mass (M ). In our
model M corresponds to the mass of the eﬀecton.

33

The eﬀect of γ-quantum irradiation without recoil was discovered by M¨ossbauer

in 1957 and named after him.

The value of M¨ossbauer eﬀect is determined by the value of f ≤ 1.
The big recoil energy may be transferred to the lattice by portions that
are resonant to the frequency of IR photons (tr and lb) and phonons. The
possibility of superradiation of IR quanta stimulation as a result of
such recoil process is a consequence of our mesoscopic model.

The scattering of γ-quanta without lattice excitation, when ER << hνph, is
termed the elastic one. The general expression [11, 12] for the probability of
such phononless elastic γ-quantum radiation acts is equal to:

f = exp(cid:18)−

4π < x2 >

λ2
0

(cid:19)

(3.6)

where λ0 = c/ν0 is the real wavelength of γ-quantum; <x2 > - the nucleus
oscillations mean amplitude squared in the direction of γ-quantum irradiation.

The γ-quanta wavelength parameter may be introduced like:

where: L0 = 1.37 · 10−5cm for F e57, then eq.(3.6) could be written as follows:

L0 = λ0/2π,

(3.7)

f = exp(cid:18)−

It may be shown [12], proceeding from the model of crystal as a system of 3N
identical quantum oscillators, that when temperature (T) is much lower than
the Debye one (θD) then:

< x2 >=

3.2. Probability of elastic eﬀects

Mean square displacements <x2 > of an atoms or molecules in condensed
matter (eq. 3.8) is not related to excitation of thermal photons or phonons
(i.e. primary or secondary transitons). According to our concept, < x2 > is
caused by the mobility of the atoms forming eﬀectons and diﬀers for primary
and secondary translational and librational eﬀectons in (a, ¯a)tr,lb and (b, b)tr,lb
states.

We will ignore below the contributions of macro- and supereﬀectons in
M¨ossbauer eﬀect as very small. Then the resulting probability of elastic eﬀects
at γ-quantum radiation is determined by the sum of the following contributions
(see eqs.4.2 − 4.4 of [1, 2]):

f =

function.

Mean square displacements within diﬀerent types of eﬀectons in eqs.(3.14-
3.17) are related to their phase and group velocities. At ﬁrst we express the
displacements using group velocities of the waves B(vgr) and periods of corre-
sponding oscillations (T ) as:

of primary translational and librational eﬀectons in a-state;

(va

gr)tr,lb are the group velocities of atoms forming these eﬀectons

equal in (a) and (b) states.

Group velocities of atoms in primary and secondary eﬀectons may be expressed
using corresponding phase velocities (vph) and formulae for waves B length as

tr,lb =

(3.23)

In accordance with mesoscopic theory, the wave B length, impulses and group
velocities in a and b states of the eﬀectons are equal. Similarly to (3.23), we
obtain the group velocities of particles, composing secondary eﬀectons:

tr,lb =

gr (cid:1)2
(cid:0) ¯va,b

h2

ph !2
m2   ¯νa,b

¯va,b

(3.24)

Substituting eqs.(3.23) and (3.24) into (3.18-3.21), we ﬁnd the important ex-
pressions for the average coherent displacements of particles squared as a result
of their oscillations in the volume of the eﬀectons (tr, lib) in both discreet states
(acoustic and optic):

< (xa)2

tr,lb >= (h/mva

lations for ice and water are presented on Figs.3.1 and 3.2.

As far the second order phase transitions in general case are accompanied
by the alterations of the sound velocity and the positions of translational and
librational bands, they should also be accompanied by alterations of ftot and its
components.

The total probability (f ) and its components, caused by primary and sec-
ondary quasiparticles were calculated according to formula (3.13). The value of
(f ) determines the magnitude of the M¨ossbauer eﬀect registered by γ-resonance
spectroscopy.

The band width caused by recoilless eﬀects is determined by the uncertainty

principle and expressed as follows:

Γ =

h
τ

≈

10−27
1.4 · 10−7 = 7.14 · 10−21 erg = 4.4 · 10−9eV

(3.31)

where τ is the lifetime of nucleus in excited state (for F e57 τ = 1.4 · 10−7s).

The position of the band depends on the mean square velocity of atoms, i.e.
on second order Doppler eﬀect. In the experiment, such an eﬀect is compen-
sated by the velocity of γ-quanta source motion relative to absorbent. In the
framework of our model this velocity is interrelated with the mean velocity of
the secondary eﬀectons diﬀusion in condensed matter.

3.3. Doppler broadening in spectra of nuclear gamma-resonance

(NGR)

M¨ossbauer eﬀect is characterized by the nonbroadened component of NGR

spectra only, with probability of observation determined by eq.(3.13).

When the energy of absorbed γ-quanta exceeds the energy of thermal IR pho-
tons (tr,lib) or phonons excitation, the absorbance band broadens as a result of
Doppler eﬀect. Within the framework of our mesoscopic concept the Doppler
broadening is caused by thermal displacements of the particles during [a ⇔ b
and ¯a ⇔ ¯b]tr,lb transitions of primary and secondary eﬀectons, leading to orig-
ination/annihilation of the corresponding type of deformons (electromagnetic
and acoustic).

The ﬂickering clusters: [lb/tr] convertons (a and b), can contribute in the

NGR line broadening also.

In that case, the value of Doppler broadening (∆Γ) of the band in the NGR
spectrum could be estimated from corresponding kinetic energies of these ex-
citations, related to their group velocities (see eq. 4.31). In our consideration
we take into account the reduced to one molecule kinetic energies of pri-
mary and secondary translational and librational transitons, a-convertons and
b-convertons. The contributions of macroconvertons, macro- and superdefor-
mons are much smaller due to their small probability and concentration:

of primary and secondary transitons (eqs.3.5 and 3.7);

(nef )lb = ncon is a concentration of primary librational eﬀectons, equal to
that of the convertons; Pt and ¯Pt are the relative probabilities of primary and
secondary transitons (eqs. 4.26 and 4.27); Pac and Pbc are relative probabilities
of (a and b) -convertons (see Chapter 4 of [1]);

Tt and ¯Tt are the kinetic energies of primary and secondary transitons, re-
lated to the corresponding total energies of these excitations (Et and ¯Et), their
masses (Mt and M t) and the resulting sound velocity (vs, see eq.2.40) in the

The broadening of NGR spectral lines by Doppler eﬀect in liquids is generally

of M¨ossbauer atom has the character of unlimited diﬀusion [13]:

for example Fe57, decreases due to diﬀusion and corresponding Doppler broad-
ening of band (∆Γ):

fD =

Γ

Γ + ∆Γ

(3.37)

where ∆Γ corresponds to eq.(3.32).The formulae obtained here make it possible
to experimentally verify a set of consequences of our mesoscopic theory using the
gamma- resonance method. A more detailed interpretation of the data obtained
by this method also becomes possible.

The magnitude of (∆Γ) was calculated according to formula (3.32). It cor-
responds well to experimentally determined Doppler widening in the nuclear
gamma resonance (NGR) spectra of ice.

molecules and ions.

Hypothesis of Vibro-gravitational interaction

During the period of particles thermal oscillations (tr and lb), their in-
stant velocity, acceleration and corresponding forces alternatively and strongly
change.

The change of wave B instant group velocity, averaged during the molecule
oscillation period in composition of the (a) and (b) states of the eﬀectons, de-
termines the average acceleration:

"aa,b

gr =

dva,b
gr
dt

=

va,b
gr
T

= vgrνa,b#1,2,3

tr,lb

(3.38)

We keep in mind that group velocities, impulses and wave B length in (a) and
(b) states of the eﬀectons are equal, in accordance with our model.

Corresponding to (3.38) forces:

(cid:2)F a,b = maa,b

gr(cid:3)1,2,3

tr,lb

The energies of molecules in (a) and (b) states of the eﬀectons also can be
expressed via accelerations:

(3.39)

(3.40)

hEa,b = hνa,b = F a,bλ = maa,b · λ = maa,b(va,b

ph /νa,b)i1,2,3

tr,lb

From (3.40) one can express the accelerations of particles in the primary eﬀec-
tons of condensed matter, using their phase velocities as a waves B:

"aa,b

gr =

h(νa,b)2
mva,b

ph #1,2,3

tr,lb

(3.41)

The accelerations of particles in composition of secondary eﬀectons have a sim-
ilar form:

"¯aa,b

gr =

h(¯νa,b)2
m¯va,b

ph #1,2,3

tr,lb

(3.42)

These parameters are important for understanding the dynamic properties of
condensed systems. The accelerations of the atoms, forming primary and sec-
ondary eﬀectons can be calculated, using eqs.(2.74-2.75 of [1]) to determine
phase velocities and eqs. (2.27, 2.28, 2.54, 2.55 [1]) to ﬁnd a frequencies.

43

Multiplying (3.41) and (3.42) by the atomic mass m, we derive the most
probable and mean forces acting upon the particles in both states of primary
and secondary eﬀectons in condensed matter:

"F a,b

gr =

h(νa,b)2

va,b
ph

#1,2,3

tr,lb

" ¯F a,b

gr =

h(¯νa,b)2

¯va,b
ph

#

(3.43)

The comparison of calculated accelerations with empirical data of the M¨ossbauer
eﬀect - supports the correctness of our approach.

According to eq.(2.54) in the low temperature range, when hνa << kT , the
frequency of secondary tr and lb eﬀectons in the (a) state can be estimated as:

νa =

νa

exp(cid:0) hνa

kT (cid:1) − 1

≈

kT
h

(3.44)

For example, at T = 200K we have ¯νa ≈ 4 · 1012s−1.

If the phase speed in eq.(3.42) is taken equal to ¯va

Fig.2a) and the mass of water molecule:

ph = 2.1 · 105cm/s (see

m = 18 · 1.66 · 10−24g = 2.98 · 10−23g,

then from (3.42) we get the acceleration of molecules in composition of secondary
eﬀectons of ice in (a) state:

¯aa
gr =

h(¯νa)2
m¯va
ph

= 1.6 · 1016cm/s2

This value is about 1013 times more than that of free fall acceleration (g =
9.8 · 102cm/s2), which agrees well with experimental data, obtained for solid
bodies [11].

Accelerations of H2O molecules in composition of primary librational eﬀec-
tons (aa
gr) in the ice at 200K and in water at 300K are equal to: 0.6 · 1013cm/s2
and 2 · 1015cm/s2, correspondingly. They also exceed to many orders the
free fall acceleration.

It was shown experimentally (Sherwin, 1960), that heating of solid body
leads to decreasing of gamma-quanta frequency (red Doppler shift) i.e. increas-
ing of corresponding quantum transitions period. This can be explained as the
relativist time-pace decreasing due to elevation of average thermal velocity of
atoms [11].

The thermal vibrations of particles (atoms, molecules) in composition of
primary eﬀectons as a partial Bose-condensate are coherent. The increasing
of such clusters dimensions, determined by most probable wave B length, as a
result of cooling, pressure elevation or under magnetic ﬁeld action (see section
14.6 of [1]) leads to enhancement of coherent regions.

44

Each coherently vibrating cluster of particles with big alternating
accelerations, like librational and translational eﬀectons is a source of
coherent gravitational waves.

The frequency of these vibro-gravitational waves (VGW) is equal to fre-
quency of particles vibrations (i.e. frequency of the eﬀectons in a or b states).
The amplitude of VGW (AG) is proportional to the number of vibrating coher-
ently particles (NG) in composition of primary eﬀectons:

AG ∼ NG ∼ Vef /(V0/N0) = (1/nef )/(V0/N0)

The resonant long-distance gravitational interaction between coher-
ent clusters of the same body or between that of diﬀerent bodies is
possible. The formal description of this vibro-gravitational interac-
tion (VGI) could be like that of distant macroscopic Van der Waals
interaction.

Diﬀerent patterns of nonlocal Bose-condensate of standing grav-
itational waves in vacuum represent the ﬁeld-informational copy of
local Bose- condensate of the eﬀectons of condensed matter.

Very important role of proposed here distant resonant VIBRO-
GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION (VGI) in elementary acts of
perception and memory can be contributed by coherent primary li-
brational water eﬀectons in microtubules of the nerve cells (see paper
”Hierarchic Model of Consciousness” in URL: http://www.karelia.ru/˜alexk
and http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0003045).

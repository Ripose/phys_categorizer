Abstract

An inspection of the contemporary physics literature reveals that, while matter
is treated at all levels of study, from Newtonian mechanics to quantum ﬁeld theory,
antimatter is solely treated at the level of second quantization. For the purpose of
initiating the restoration of full equivalence in the treatments of matter and antimatter
in due time, in this paper we present a classical representation of antimatter which
begins at the primitive Newtonian level with expected images at all subsequent levels.
By recalling that charge conjugation of particles into antiparticles is anti–automorphic,
the proposed theory of antimatter is based on a new map, called isoduality, which is also
anti–automorphic, yet it is applicable beginning at the classical level and then persists
at the quantum level. As part of our study, we present novel anti–isomorphic isodual
images of the Galilean, special and general relativities and show the compatibility of
their representation of antimatter with all available classical experimental knowledge,
that on electromagnetic interactions. We also identify the prediction of antigravity
for antimatter in the ﬁeld of matter (or vice–versa) without any claim on its validity,
and defer its resolution to speciﬁc experiments. To avoid a prohibitive length, the
paper is restricted to the classical treatment which had not been suﬃciently treated
until now. Studies on operator proﬁles, such as the equivalence of isoduality and charge
conjugation and the implication of the isodual theory in particle physics, are conducted
n a separate paper.

1 INTRODUCTION

After being conjectured by A. Schuster in 1898, antimatter was predicted by P. A. M.
Dirac [1] in the late 1920’s in the negative–energy solutions of his celebrated equation. Dirac
himself soon discovered that particles with negative–energy do not behave in a physical

1

way and, for this reason, he submitted his celebrated “hole theory”, which subsequently
restricted the study of antimatter to the level of second quantization (for historical aspects
on antimatter see, e.g., Ref. [2]).

The above occurrence created an imbalance in the physics of this century because matter
is described at all levels of study, from Newtonian mechanics to quantum ﬁeld theory, while
antimatter is solely treated at the level of second quantization.

To initiate the study for the future removal of this imbalance in due time, in this paper
we present a theory of antimatter which has been conceived to begin at the purely classical
Newtonian level, and then to admit corresponding images at all subsequent levels of study.
Our guiding principle is to identify a map which possesses the main mathematical struc-
ture of charge conjugation, yet it is applicable at all levels, and not solely at the operator
level.

The main characteristic of charge conjugation is that of being anti–automorphic (or, more
generally, anti–isomorphic). After studying a number of possibilities, a map which is anti–
isomorphic and applicable at all levels of study, is the following isodual map of any given
quantity Q

Q → Qd = −Q†.
which, for consistency, must be applied to the totality of the mathematical structure of the
conventional theory of matter, including numbers, ﬁelds, spaces, geometries, algebras, etc.
This results in a new mathematics, called isodual mathematics, which is at the foundation
of the classical isodual theory of antimatter of this paper.

(1.1)

Since the isodual mathematics is virtually unknown, we shall review and expand it in
Sect. 2. In Sect. 3 we shall then present, apparently for the ﬁrst time, the classical isodual
Galilean, special and general relativities and show that their representation of antimatter
is indeed compatible with available classical experimental data, those of electromagnetic
nature. In the Appendix we outline the classical isodual Lagrangian and Hamiltonian me-
chanics. The operator version of the isodual theory of antimatter is studied in a separate
papers which also prove the equivalence between isoduality and charge conjugation.

The rather limited existing literature in isoduality is the following. The isodual map (1.1)
was ﬁrst proposed by Santilli in Ref.s [3] of 1985 and then remained ignored for several years.
More recently, the isodual numbers characterized by map (1.1) have been studied in paper [4].
The ﬁrst hypothesis on the isodual theory of antimatter appeared for the operator version in
Ref. [5] of 1993 which also contains an initial study of the equivalence between isoduality and
charge conjugation. The fundamental notion of this study, the isodual Poincar`e symmetry,
from which the entirety of the (relativistic) analysis can be uniquely derived, was submitted
in Ref. [6] of 1993 also at the operator level.

The prediction of the isodual theory that antimatter in the ﬁeld of matter experiences
antigravity was ﬁrst submitted in Ref. [7] of 1994. An experiment for the measure of the
gravity of elementary antiparticles in the gfravitational ﬁeld of Earth was also proposed in
Ref. [7]. It essentially consists in commparative measures of the gravity of collimated, low
energy beams of positrons and electrons in horizontal ﬂight on a tube with suﬃcienr vacuum
as well as protection from stray ﬁelds and of suﬃcient length to permit a deﬁnite result, e.g.,
the view by the naked eye of the displacements due to gravity of the positron and electron
beams on a scientillator at the end of the ﬂight.

2

The isodual diﬀerential calculus, which is fundamental for the correct formulation of
dynamical equations all the way to those in curved spaces, was studied only recently in
Ref. [8]. A review of the operator proﬁle up to 1995 is available in monograph [9].

This paper is the classical counterpart of the companion paper [10] in which we study
the operator proﬁle, with particular reference to the equivalence between isoduality and
charge conjugation and the predictions of the new theory in particle physics. The additional
adjoining paper [11] presents a general outline of the isodualities of the broader isotopic,
genotopic and hyperstructural formulations which are under study for antimatter in interior
conditions (such as for the structure of an antimatter star) and they are not considered in
this paper for brevity.

An important independent contribution in the ﬁeld has been made by the experimentalist
A.P. Mills, Jr. [12], who has conﬁrmed the apparent feasibility with current technology of the
test of the gravity of antiparticles proposed in ref. [7] via the use of eletrons and positrons
with energy of the order of milli-eV in horizontal ﬂight in a vacuum tube of approximately
100 m length with a diameter and design suitable to reduce stray ﬁelds and patch eﬀects at
its center down to acceptable levels.

Additional contributions have been made by: J. V. Kadeisvili on the isodual functional
analysis and isodual Lie theory [13]; Lohmus, Paal, Sorgsepp, Sourlas, Tsagas [14]; and
others.

Theoretical and experimental studies on the isodual theory of antimatter were con-
ducted at the International Workshop on Antimatter Gravity and Anti–Hydrogen Atom
Spectroscopy, held in Sepino, Italy, in May 1996 (see the Proceedings [15]).

2 RUDIMENTS OF ISODUAL MATHEMATICS

2.1

Isodual units, numbers, and ﬁelds.

Let F = F (a, +, ×) be a conventional ﬁeld of real numbers R(n, +, ×), complex numbers
C(c, +, ×) or quaternionic numbers Q(q, +, ×) with the familiar additive unit 0, multiplica-
tive unit I, elements a = n, c, q, sum a1 + a2, a + 0 = 0 + a = a, and multiplication
a1 × a2 = a1a2, a × I = I × a = a, ∀a, a1, a2 ∈ F .

The isodual ﬁelds, ﬁrst introduced in ref. [3] and then studied in details in ref. [4], are
the image F d = F d(ad, +d, ×d) of F (a, +, ×) characterized by the isodual map of the unit

which implies: isodual numbers

I → I d = −I † = −I,

ad = a† × I d = −a† × I = −a†,

where † is the identity for real numbers n† = n, complex conjugation c† = ¯c for complex
numbers c and Hermitean conjugation q† for quaternions q†; isodual sum

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

and isodual multiplication

1 +d ad
ad

2 = −(a†

1 + a†

under which I d is the correct left and right unit of F d,

1 ×d ad
ad

2 = ad

1 × I d × ad

2 = = −a†

1 × a†
2;

I d ×d ad = ad ×d I d ≡ ad, ∀ad ∈ F d,

in which case (only) ˆI d is called isodual unit.

We have in this way the isodual real ﬁeld Rd(nd, +d, ×d) with isodual real numbers

the isodual complex ﬁeld C d(cd, +d, ×d) with isodual complex numbers

nd = −n† × I ≡ −n, n ∈ R, nd ∈ Rd;

cd = −¯c = −(n1 − i × n2) = −n1 + i × n2,

n1, n2 ∈ R, c ∈ C, cd ∈ C d;

and the isodual quaternionic ﬁeld which is not used in this paper for brevity.

Under the above assumptions, F d(ad, +d, ×d) veriﬁes all the axioms of a ﬁeld [loc. cit.],
although F d and F are anti–isomorphic, as desired. This establishes that the ﬁeld of numbers
can be equally deﬁned either with respect to the traditional unit +1 or with respect to its
negative image -1. The key point is the preservation of the axiomatic character of the latter
via the isoduality of the multiplication. In other words, the set isodual numbers ad with unit
-1 and conventional product does not constitute a ﬁeld because I d × ad 6= ad.

It is also evident that all operations of numbers implying multiplications must be subjected

for consistency to isoduality. This implies the isodual square root

the isodual quotient

ad/dbd = −(ad/bd) = −(a†/b† =) = cd, bd ×d cd = ad;

(2.9)

and so on.

A property of isodual ﬁelds of fundamental relevance for our characterization of antimat-

ter is that they have negative–deﬁnite norm, called isodual norm [3,4]

|ad|d = |a†| × I d = −(aa†)1/2 < 0.

where |...| denotes the conventional norm. For isodual real numbers nd we therefore have
the isodual isonorm

and for isodual complex numbers we have

|nd|d = −|n| < 0,

|cd|d = −|¯c| = −(c¯c)1/2 = −(n2

Lemma 2.1: All quantities which are positive–deﬁnite when referred to ﬁelds (such
as mass, energy, angular momentum, density, temperature, time, etc.) became negative–
deﬁnite when referred to isodual ﬁelds.

As recalled in Sect. 1, antiparticles have been discovered in the negative–energy solutions
of Dirac’s equation [1] and they were originally thought to evolve backward in time (Stueck-
elberg, and others, see [2]). The possibility of representing antimatter and antiparticles via
isodual methods is therefore visible already from these introductory notions.

The main novelty is that the conventional treatment of negative–deﬁnite energy and
time was (and still is) referred to the conventional contemporary unit +1, which leads to a
number of contradictions in the physical behavior of antiparticles whose solution forced the
transition to second quantization.

By comparison, the negative-deﬁnite physical quantities of isodual methods are referred
to a negative–deﬁnite unit I d < 0. As we shall see, this implies a mathematical and physical
equivalence between positive–deﬁnite quantities referred to positive–deﬁnite units, charac-
terizing matter, and negative–deﬁnite quantities referred to negative–deﬁnite units, charac-
terizing antimatter. These foundations then permit a novel characterization of antimatter
beginning at the Newtonian level, and then persisting at all subsequent levels.

Deﬁnition 2.1:A quantity is called isoselfdual when it is invariant under isoduality.

The above notion is particularly important for this paper because it introduces a new
invariance, the invariance under isoduality. We shall encounter several isoselfdual quantities.
At this introductory stage we indicate that the imaginary number i is isoselfdual,

id = −i† = −¯i = −(−i) = i.

(2.13)

This property permits to understand better the isoduality of complex numbers which can

be written explicitly [4]

cd = (n1 + i × n2)d = nd

1 + id ×d nd
We assume the reader is aware of the emergence here of basically new numbers, those
with a negative unit, which have no connection with ordinary negative numbers and which
are the true foundations of the proposed isodual theory of antimatter.

2 = −n1 + i × n2 = −¯c.

(2.14)

2.2

Isodual functional analysis.

All conventional and special functions and transforms, as well as functional analysis at large
must be subjected to isoduality for consistent applications of isodual theories, resulting in a
simple, yet unique and signiﬁcant isodual functional analysis, whose study was initiated by
Kadeisvili [13].

We here mention the isodual trigonometric functions

sind θd = − sin(−θ), cosd = θd = − cos(−θ),

(2.15)

with related basic property

5

cosd 2d θd + sind 2d θd = 1d = −1,

(2.16)

sinhd wd = − sinh(−w), coshd wd = − cosh(−w),

(2.17)

the isodual hyperbolic functions

with related basic property

the isodual logarithm

coshd 2d wd − sinhd 2d wd = 1d = −1,

logd nd = −log(−n),

Interested readers can then easily construct the isodual image of special functions,

etc.
transforms, distributions, etc.

2.3

Isodual diﬀerential calculus.

The conventional diﬀerential calculus is indeed dependent on the assumed unit. This prop-
erty is not so transparent in the conventional formulation because the basic unit is the trivial
number +1, thus having null diﬀerential. However, the dependence of the unit emerges rather
forceful under its generalization.

The isodual diﬀerential calculus, ﬁrst introduced in ref. [8], is characterized by the isodual

diﬀerentials

ddxk = I d × dxk = −dxk, ddxk = −dxk,

with corresponding isodual derivatives

∂d/∂dxk = −∂/∂xk, ∂d/∂dxk = −∂/∂x,

and other isodual properties.

Note that conventional diﬀerentials are isoselfdual, i.e.,

but derivatives are not in general isoselfdual,

(dxk)d = ddxkd ≡ d xk,

(∂f (x)/∂xk)d = ∂df d/d∂dxkd = −∂f /∂xk.

Other properties can be easily derived and shall be hereon assumed.

2.4

Isodual Lie theory.

Let L be an n–dimensional Lie algebra with universal enveloping associative algebra ξ(L),
[ξ(L)]− ≈ L, n-d-imensional unit I = diag.(1, 1, ..., 1) for the regular representation, ordered
set of Hermitean generators X = = X † = {Xk}, conventional associative product Xi×Xj,
and familiar Lie’s Theorems over a ﬁeld F (a, +, ×).

The isodual Lie theory was ﬁrst submitted in ref. [3] and then studied in Ref. [9] as well
as by other authors [13,14]. The isodual universal associative algebra [ξ(L)]d is characterized
by the isodual unit I d, isodual generators X d = −X, and isodual associative product

X d

i ×d X d

j = −Xi × Xj,

(2.24)

with corresponding inﬁnite–dimensional basis (isodual version of the conventional Poincar´e–
Birkhoﬀ–Witt theorem [3]) characterizing the isodual exponentiation of a generic quantity
A

edA

= I d + Ad/d1!d + Ad ×d Ad/d2!d + ... = −eA†

,

(2.25)

where e is the conventional exponentiation

The attached isodual Lie algebra Ld ≈ (ξd)− over the isodual ﬁeld F d(ad, +d, ×d) is

characterized by the isodual commutators [loc. cit.]

[X d

i , X d

j ]d = −[Xi, Xj] = C kd

ij ×d X d

(2.26)

with a classical realization given in Appendix A.

Let G be the conventional, connected, n–dimensional Lie transformation group on S(x,
g, F ) admitting L as the Lie algebra in the neighborhood of the identity, with generators Xk
and parameters w = {wk}. The isodual Lie group Gd [3] admitting the isodual Lie algebra
Ld in the neighborhood of the isodual identity Id is the n–dimensional group with generators
X d = {−Xk} and parameters wd = {−wk} over the isodual ﬁeld F d with generic element

U d(wd) = edid

dwd

×

×

dXd

= −ei×(−w)×X = −U(−w).

(2.27)

The isodual symmetries are then deﬁned accordingly via the use of the isodual groups
Gd and they are anti–isomorphic to the corresponding conventional symmetries, as desired.
For additional details, one may consult Ref. [9].

In this paper we shall therefore use:

1) Conventional Lie symmetries, for the characterization of matter; and

2) Isodual Lie symmetries, for the characterization of antimatter.

2.5

Isodual Euclidean geometry.

Conventional (vector and) metric spaces are deﬁned over conventional ﬁelds. It is evident
that the isoduality of ﬁelds requires, for consistency, a corresponding isoduality of (vector
and) metric spaces. The need for the isodualities of all quantities acting on a metric space

7

(e.g., conventional and special functions and transforms, diﬀerential calculus, etc.) becomes
then evident.

Let S = S(x, g, R) be a conventional N–dimensional metric space with local coordinates
x = {xk}, k = 1, 2, ..., N, nowhere degenerate, suﬃciently smooth, real–valued and
symmetric metric g(x, ...) and related invariant

x2 = xigijxj,

(2.28)

over the reals R.

The isodual spaces, ﬁrst introduced Ref. [3], are the spaces Sd(xd, gd, Rd) of S(x, g, R)

with isodual coordinates xd = x × I d, isodual metric

gd(xd, ...) = −g†(−x, ...) = −g(−x, ...),

(2.29)

and isodual interval

(x − y)d2 d = [(x − y)id ×d gd

ij ×d (x − y)jd] × I d = [(x − y)i × gd

ij × (x − y)jd] × I d, (2.30)

deﬁned over the isodual ﬁeld Rd = Rd(nd, +d, ×d) with the same isodual isounit I d.
The basic space of our analysis is the three–dimensional isodual Euclidean space,

Ed(rd, δd, Rd) : rd = {rkd} = {−rk} = {−x, −y, −z},

δd = −δ = diag.(−1, −1, −1), I d = −I = diag.(−1, −1, −1).

(2.31)

The isodual Euclidean geometry is then the geometry of the isodual space Ed over Rd
and it is given by a step–by–step isoduality of all the various aspects of the conventional
geometry.

We only mention for brevity the notion of isodual line on Ed over Rd given by the isodual
image of the conventional notion of line on E over R. As such, its coordinates are isodual
numbers xd = x × 1d with unit 1d = = −1. By recalling that the norm on Rd is negative–
deﬁnite, the isodual distance among two points on an isodual line is also negative deﬁnite
and it is given by Dd = D × 1d = −D, where D is the conventional distance. Similar
isodualities apply to all remaining notions, including the notions of parallel and intersecting
isodual lines, the Euclidean axioms, etc. The following property is of evident proof:

Lemma 2.2: The isoeuclidean geometry on Ed over Rd is anti–isomorphic to the con-

ventional geometry on E over R.

The isodual sphere is the perfect sphere in Ed over Rd and, as such, it has negative radius,

Rd2d = [xd2d + yd2d + zd2d] × I d .

(2.32)

A similar characterization holds for other isodual shapes which characterize the shape of

antimatter in our isodual theory.

The group of isometries of Ed over Rd is the isodual euclidean group studied in Ref. [9].

8

2.6

Isodual Minkowskian geometry.

The isodual Minkowski space, ﬁrst introduced in Ref.s [3], is given by

M d(xd, ηd, Rd) : xd = {xµd} = {xµ × I d} = {−r, −cot} × I,

ηd = −η = diag.(−1, −1, −1, +1), I d = diag.(−1, −1, −1, −1).

(2.33)

The isodual Minkowskian geometry [6] is the geometry of isodual spaces M d over Rd. It
is also characterized by a simple isoduality of the conventional Minkowskian geometry and
its explicit presentation is omitted for brevity.

We here merely mention the isodual light cone

xd 2 d = (xµd ×d ηd

µν ×d xνd) × I d = (−x x − y y − z z + tc2

ot) × (−I) = 0.

(2.34)

As one can see, the above cone formally coincides with the conventional light cone,
although the two cones belong to diﬀerent spaces. The isodual light cone is used in these
studies as the cone of light emitted by antimatter in empty space (exterior problem).

The group of isometries of M d over Rd is the isodual Poincar`e symmetry P d(3.1) =

Ld(3.1) × T d(3.1) [6] and constitutes the fundamental symmetry of this paper.

2.7

Isodual Riemannian geometry.

Consider a Riemannian space ℜ(x, g, R) in (3 + 1) dimensions with basic unit I = diag.
(1, 1, 1, 1) and related Riemannian geometry in local formulation. The isodual Riemannian
spaces are given by

ℜd(xd, gd, Rd)

:

xd = {−ˆxµ},
gd = −g = (x), g ∈ ℜ(x, g, R),
I d = diag.(−1, −1, −1, −1)

(2.35)

with interval x2d = [xdt ×dgd(xd) ×dxd] × I d = [xt ×gd(xd) ×x] ×I d on Rd, where t stands
for transposed.

The isodual Riemannian geometry is the geometry of spaces ℜd over Rd, and it is also
given by step–by–step isodualities of the conventional geometry, including, most importantly,
the isoduality of the diﬀerential and exterior calculus.

As an example, an isodual vector ﬁeld X d(xd) on ℜd is given by X d(xd) = −X(−x).

The isodual exterior diﬀerential of X d(xd) is given by

DdX kd(xd) = ddX kd(xd) + Γd
i

j ×d X id ×d ddxd = DX k(−x),
k

(2.36)

where the Γd’s are the components of the isodual connection. The isodual covariant derivative
is then given by

X id(xd)|dk = ∂dX id(xd)/d∂dxkd + Γd
i

j ×d X jd(xd) = −X i(−x)|k .
k

(2.37)

The interested reader can then easily derive the isoduality of the remaining notions of

It is an instructive exercise for the interested reader to work out in detail the proof of

the conventional geometry.

the following:

Lemma 2.3: The isoduality of the Riemannian space ℜ(x, g, R) to its anti–automorphic

µν = −Rµν,

The reader should be aware that recent studies have identiﬁed the universal symmetry of
conventional gravitation with Riemannian metric g(x), the so–called isoPoincar`e symmetry
ˆP (3.1) = ˆL(3.1) × ˆT (3.1) [6]. The latter symmetry is the image of the conventional
symmetry constructed with respect to the generalized unit

where T (x) is a 4 × 4 matrix originating from the factorization of the Riemannian metric
into the Minkowskian one,

ˆI(x) = [T (x)]−1,

g(x) = T (x) × η.

In particular, since T (x) is always positive–deﬁnite, we have the local isomorphism

ˆP (3.1) ≈ P (3.1).

The same Ref. [6] has constructed the operator version of the isodual isoPoincar`e sym-
metry ˆP d(3.1) ≈ P d(3.1), whose classical realization is the universal symmetry of the isodual
Riemannian spaces ℜd over Rd.

In summary, the geometries signiﬁcant in this paper are:

1) The conventional Euclidean, Minkowskian and Riemannian geometries, which

are used for the characterization of matter; and

2) The isodual Euclidean, Minkowskian and Riemannian geometries, which are

used for the characterization of antimatter.

3 CLASSICAL ISODUAL THEORY OF ANTIMAT-

TER

3.1 Fundamental assumption.

As it is well known, the contemporary treatment of matter is characterized by conventional
mathematics, here referred to conventional numbers, ﬁelds, spaces, etc. with positive unit
and norm, thus having conventional positive characteristics of mass, energy, time, etc.

In this paper we study the following:

Hypothesis 3.1: Antimatter is characterized by the isodual mathematics, that with
isodual numbers, ﬁelds, spaces, etc., thus having negative–deﬁnite units and norm. All
characteristics of matter therefore change sign for antimatter represented via isoduality.

The above hypothesis evidently provides the correct conjugation of the charge at the
desired classical level. However, by no means, the sole change of the sign of the charge is
suﬃcient to ensure a consistent classical representation of antimatter. To achieve consis-
tency, the theory must resolve the main problematic aspect of current classical treatments of
antimatter, the fact that their operator image is not the correct charge conjugation of that
of matter, as evident from the existence of a single quantization procedure.

It appears that the above problematic aspect is indeed resolved by the isodual theory.
The main reason is that, jointly with the conjugation of the charge, isoduality also conjugates
all other physical characteristics of matter. This implies two channels of quantization, the
conventional one for matter and a new isodual quantization for antimatter (see App. A) such
that its operator image is indeed the charge conjugate of that of matter.

In this section we shall study the physical consistency of the theory in its classical formu-
lation. The novel isodual quantization, the equivalence of isoduality and charge conjugation
and related operator issues are studied in papers [5,10].

To begin our analysis, we note that Hypothesis 3.1 removes the traditional obstacles
against negative energies and masses. In fact, particles with negative masses and energies
referred to negative units are fully equivalent to particles with positive energy and masses
referred to positive units. Moreover, as we shall see shortly, particles with negative energy
referred to negative units behave in a fully physical way. This has permitted the study in
ref. [10] of the possible elimination of necessary use of second quantization for the quantum
characterization of antiparticles, as the reader should expect because our main objective is
the achievement of equivalent treatments for particles and antiparticles at all levels, thus
including ﬁrst quantization.

Hypothesis 3.1 also resolves the additional, well known, problematic aspects of motion
backward in time. In fact, time moving backward referred to a negative unit is fully equivalent
to time moving forward referred to a positive unit. This conﬁrms the plausibility of the ﬁrst
conception of antiparticles by Stueckelberg and others as moving backward in time (see the
historical analysis of Ref. [2]), and creates new possibilities for the ongoing research on the
so-called ”time machine” to be studied in separate works.

In this section we construct the classical isodual theory of antimatter at the Galilean,

ibility with available classical experimental evidence (that on electromagnetic interactions
only). We also identify the prediction of the isodual theory that antimatter in the ﬁeld of
matter experiences gravitational repulsion (antigravity), and point out the ongoing eﬀorts
for its future experimental resolutions [12,15]. For completeness, the classical isodual La-
grangian and Hamiltonian mechanics are provided in the Appendix as the foundation of the
isoquantization of the joining paper [10].

3.2 Representation of antimatter via the classical isodual Galilean

relativity.

We now introduce the isodual Galilean relativity as the most eﬀective way for the classical
nonrelativistic characterization of antimatter according to Hypothesis 3.1.

The study can be initiated with the isodual representation of antimatter at the most
primitive dynamical level, that of Newton’s equation. Once a complete symmetry between
the treatment of matter and antimatter is reached at the Newtonian level, it is expected to
persist at all subsequent levels.

The conventional Newton’s equations for a system of N point-like particles with (non-
null) masses ma, a = 1, 2, ..., N, in exterior conditions in vacuum are given by the familiar
expression

ma × d vka / dt = Fka(t, r, v), r = {x, y, z}, a = 1, 2, ..., N, v = dr/dt,

(3.1)

deﬁned on the 7-dimensional Euclidean space ET ot(t, r, v) = E(t, Rt) × E(r, δ, Rr) ×
E(v, δ, Rv) with corresponding 7-dimensional total unit IT ot = It × Ir × Iv, where one
usually assumes Rr = Rv, It = 1, Ir = Iv = Diag.(1, 1, 1).

The isodual Newton equations here submitted for the representation of n point-like an-

tiparticles in vacuum are deﬁned on the isodual space

Ed(td, rd, vd) = Ed(td, Rd
T ot = I d

(3.3)

It is easy to see that, when projected in the original space S(t, r, v), isoduality changes the
sign of all physical characteristics, as expected. It is also easy to see that the above isodual
equations are anti-isomorphic to the conventional forms, as desired.

We now introduce the isodual Galilean symmetry Gd(3.1) as the step-by-step isodual
image of the conventional symmetry G(3.1) (see, e.g., Ref. [16]). By using conventional
symbols for the Galilean symmetry of a system of N particles with non-null masses ma, a =
1, 2, ..., N, Gd(3.1) is characterized by isodual parameters and generators

(3.8)

(3.9)

In accordance with rule (2.26), the structure constants and Casimir invariants of the
isodual Lie algebra Gd(3.1) are negative–deﬁnite. From rule (2.27), if g(w) is an element of
the (connected component) of the Galilei group G(3.1), its isodual is characterize by

gd(wd) = ed−id

dwd

×

dXd

= −ei×(−w)×X = −g(−w) ∈ Gd(3.1).

(3.7)

The isodual Galilean transformations are then given by

td → t′d = td + td

o = −t′, rd → r′d = rd + rd

o = −r′

rd → r′d = rd + vd

o ×d td

o = −r′, rd → r′d = Rd(θd) ×d rd = −R(−θ).

where Rd(θd) is an element of the isodual rotational symmetry ﬁrst studied in the original
proposal [3].

The desired classical nonrelativistic characterization of antimatter is therefore given by
imposing the Gd(3.1) invariance of isodual equations (3.3). This implies, in particular, that
the equations admit a representation via the isodual Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
outlined in Appendix A.

We now verify that the above isodual representation of antimatter is indeed consistent
with available classical experimental knowledge for antimatter, that under electromagnetic
interactions. Once this property is established at the primitive Newtonian level, its veriﬁca-
tion at all subsequent levels of study is expected from mere compatibility arguments.

Consider a conventional, classical, massive particle and its antiparticle in exterior con-
ditions in vacuum. Suppose that the particle and antiparticle have charge −e and +e,
respectively (say, an electron and a positron), and that they enter into the gap of a magnet
with constant magnetic ﬁeld B.

As it is well known, visual experimental observation establishes that particles and an-
tiparticles have spiral trajectories of opposite orientation. But this behavior occurs for the
representation of both the particle and its antiparticle in the same Euclidean space. The
situation under isoduality is diﬀerent, as described by the following:

Lemma 3.1: The trajectory of a charged particle in Euclidean space under a magnetic
ﬁeld and the trajectory of the corresponding antiparticle in isodual Euclidean space coincide.

Proof: Suppose that the particle has negative charge −e in Euclidean space E(r, δ, R),
that is, the value −e is deﬁned with respect to the positive unit +1 of the underlying ﬁeld
of real numbers R = R(n, +, ×). Suppose that the particle is under the inﬂuence of
the magnetic ﬁeld B. The characterization of the corresponding antiparticle via isoduality
implies the reversal of the sign of all physical quantities, thus yielding the charge (−e)d = +e

13

in the isodual Euclidean space Ed(rd, δd, Rd), as well as the reversal of the magnetic ﬁeld
Bd = −B, although now deﬁned with respect to the negative unit (+1)d = −1. It is then
evident that the trajectory of a particle with charge −e in the ﬁeld B deﬁned with respect
to the unit +1 in Euclidean space and that for the antiparticle of charge +e in the ﬁeld −B
deﬁned with respect to the unit -1 in isodual Euclidean space coincide. q.e.d.

An aspect of Theorem 3.1 which is particularly important for this paper is given by the

following

Corollary 3.1.A: Antiparticles reverse their trajectories when projected from their iso-

dual space into the conventional space.

Lemma 3.1 assures that isodualities permit the representation of the correct trajectories
of antiparticles as physically observed, despite their negative energy, thus providing the
foundations for a consistent representation of antiparticles at the level of ﬁrst quantization
studied in paper [10]. Moreover, Lemma 3.1 tells us that the trajectories of antiparticles
may appear to exist in our space while in reality they may belong to an independent space,
the isodual Euclidean space, coexisting with our own space.

To verify the validity of the isodual theory at the level of Newtonian laws of electromag-
netic phenomenology, let us consider the repulsive Coulomb force among two particles of
negative charges −q1 and −q2 in E(r, δ, R),

F = K × (−q1) × (−q2)/r × r > 0,

(3.10)

where the operations of multiplication × and division / are the conventional ones of the
underlying ﬁeld R(n, +, ×). Under isoduality to Ed(rd, δd, Rd) we have

F d = K d ×d (−q1)d ×d (−q2)d/drd ×d rd = −F < 0,
where ×d = −× and /d = −/ are the isodual operations of the underlying ﬁeld
Rd(nd, +, ×d).

(3.11)

But the isodual force F d = −F occurs in the isodual Euclidean space and it is therefore
deﬁned with respect to the unit -1. As a result, isoduality correctly represents the repulsive
character of the Coulomb force for two antiparticles with positive charges.

The Coulomb force between a particle and an antiparticle can only be computed by

In the projection of the

F d = K d ×d (−q1) ×d (−q2)d/drd ×d rd > 0.

(3.13)

But this force is now referred to the unit -1, thus resulting to be again attractive.
In conclusion, the isodual Galilean relativity correctly represent the electromagnetic in-

teractions of antimatter at the classical Newtonian level.

14

3.3 Representation of antimatter via the isodual special relativity.

We now introduce the isodual special relativity as the best way to represent classical rela-
tivistic antimatter according to Hypothesis 3.1.

In essence, the conventional special relativity (see, e.g., Pauli’s historical account [17])

is constructed on the fundamental 4 – dimensional unit of the Minkowski space I =
Diag. {1, 1, 1}, 1), which represents the dimensionless units of space {+1, +1, +1}, and the
dimensionless unit of time +1, and is the unit of the Poincar`e symmetry P(3.1). The isodual
special relativity is characterized by the map

I = diag.({1, 1, 1}, 1) > 0 → I d = −diag.({1, 1, 1}, 1) < 0.

(3.14)

namely, it is based on negative units of space and time. The isodual special relativity is then
expressed by the isodual image of all mathematical and physical aspects of the conventional
relativity in such a way to admit the negative–deﬁnite quantity I d ass the correct left and
right unit.

This implies the reconstruction of the entire mathematics of the special relativity with
respect to the single, common, 4-dimensional unit I d, including: the isodual ﬁeld Rd =
Rd(nd, +d, ×d) of isodual numbers nd = n × I d = −n × I with fundamental unit I d =
−Diag.(1, 1, 1 =, 1); the isodual Minkowski space M d(xd, ηd, Rd) with isodual coordinates
xd = x × I d, isodual metric ηd = −η and basic invariant over Rd

(x − y)d2d = [(xµ − yµ) × ηd

µν × (xν − yν) × I d ∈ Rd;

the fundamental isodual Poincar`e symmetry [6]

P d(3.1) = Ld(3.1) ×d T d(3.1),

where Ld(3.1) is the isodual Lorentz symmetry, ×d is the isodual direct product and T d(3.1)
represents the isodual translations, whose classical formulation is given by a simple relativistic
extension of the isodual Galilean symmetry of the preceding section.

The algebra of the connected component P ↑d

+ (3.1) of P d(3.1) can be constructed in terms
of the isodual parameters wd = {−wk} = {−θ, −v, −a} and isodual generators X d =
−X = {−Xk} = {−Mµν, −Pµ}, where the factorization by the four-dimensional unit I is
understood. The isodual commutator rules are given by

[M d

xdµ′ = πd ×d xd = −π × x = (−r, x4), τ d ×d xd = −τ × x = −(r, −x4), (3.19)

where

βd = vd/dcd

o = −β, βd2d = −β2, γd = −(1 − β2)−1/2.

(3.20)

and the use of the isodual operations (quotient, square roots, etc.), is implied.

The isodual spinorial covering of the Poincar`e symmetry P ⌈(3.1) = SLd(2.C d) ×d T d(3.1)

can then be constructed via the same methods.

The basic postulates of the isodual special relativity are also a simple isodual image of
the conventional postulates. For instance, the maximal isodual causal speed is the speed of
light in M d, i.e.,

Vmax = cd

o = −co,

(3.21)

with the understanding that it is referred to a negative–deﬁnite unit, thus being fully equiv-
alent to the conventional maximal speed co referred to a positive unit. A similar situation
occurs for all other postulates.

A fundamental property of the isodual theory is the following:

Theorem 3.1: The line elements of metric or pseudo-metric spaces are isoselfdual (Def-
inition 2.1), i.e., they coincide with their isodual images. In particular, isoduality leaves
invariant the fundamental space-time interval of the special relativity,

xd 2 d = (xµd ×d ηd

µν ×d xνd) =

= (−x1x1 − x2x2 − x3x3 − x4x4) × (−I) ≡ (x1x1 + x2x2 + x3x3 − x4x4) × I = x2. (3.22)

The above novel property evidently assures that conventional relativistic laws for matter
are also valid for antimatter represented via isoduality, since they share the same fundamental
space-time interval.

The above property illustrates that the isodual map is so natural to creep in un-noticed.
The reason why, after about a century of studies, the isoduals of the Galilean, special and
general relativities escaped detection is that their identiﬁcation required the prior knowledge
of new numbers, those with a negative unit.

Note that the use of the two Minkowskian metrics η and ηd = = −η has been popular
since Minkowski’s times. The point is that both metrics are referred to the same unit I,
while in the isodual theory one metric is referred to the unit I on the ﬁeld R(n, +, ×) of
conventional numbers, and the other metric is referred to the new unit I d = −I on the
new ﬁeld Rd(nd, +d, ×d) of isodual numbers nd = n × I d.

The novelty of the isodual relativities is illustrated by the following

Lemma 3.3. Isodual maps and space-time inversions are inequivalent.

16

In fact, space-time inversions are characterized by the change of sign x → −x by always
preserving the original metric referred to positive units, while isoduality implies the map
x → xd = −x but now referred to an isodual metric ηd = −η with negative units
I d = −I. Thus, space-time inversions occur in the same space while isoduality implies
the map to a diﬀerent space. Moreover, as shown by lemma 3.2 isodualities interchange the
space and time inversions.

The interested reader is encouraged to verify that the physical consistency in the repre-
sentation of electromagnetic interactions by the isodual Galilean relativity carries over in its
entirety at the level of the isodual special relativity, thus conﬁrming the plausibility of the
isodual theory of antimatter also at the classical relativistic level.

3.4 Representation of antimatter via the isodual general relativity.

We ﬁnally introduce the isodual general relativity as the most eﬀective gravitational charac-
terization of antimatter according to Hypothesis 3.1. The new image is also characterized
by the isodual map of all aspects of the conventional relativity (see, e.g., [18]), now deﬁned
on the isodual Riemannian spaces ℜd(xd, gd, Rd) of Sect. 2.7

The primary motivation warranting the study of the above new image of general relativity
is the following. A problematic aspect in the use of the Riemannian geometry for the
representation of antimatter is the positive–deﬁnite energy-momentum tensor.

In fact, such a gravitational representation of antimatter has an operator image which is
not the charge conjugate of that of matter, does not admit the negative-energy solutions as
needed for operator treatments of antiparticles, and may be one of the reasons for the lack
of achievement until now of a consistent grand uniﬁcation inclusive of gravitation. Afetr all,
gauge theories are bona-ﬁde ﬁeld theories which, as such, admit both positive- and negative-
energy solutions, while the contemporary formulation of gravity admits only positive-energy
states, with an evident structural incompatibility.

Isoduality oﬀers a new possibility for a future resolution of these shortcomings.
In
fact, the isodual Riemannian geometry is deﬁned on the isodual ﬁeld of real numbers
Rd(nd, +d, ×d) for which the norm is negative–deﬁnite, Eq. (2.11). As a result, all quantities
which are positive in Riemannian geometry become negative under isoduality, thus including
the energy-momentum tensor.

Explicitly, the electromagnetic ﬁeld follows the simple rule under isoduality

ν/d∂dxdµ = −Fµν,
and for the energy-momentum tensor we have the corresponding law

µ/d∂dxνd − ∂dAd

µν = ∂dAd

(3.24)

As such, antimatter represented in isodual Riemannian geometry has negative–deﬁnite
energy-momentum tensor and other physical quantities, as desired, thus oﬀering new possi-
bilities for attempting a grand uniﬁed theory.

For completeness, we mention here the isodual Einstein equations for the exterior gravi-

tational problem of antimatter in vacuum

It is instructive for the interested reader to verify that the preceding physical consistency
of the isodual theory carries over at the above gravitational level, including the attractive
character of antimatter-antimatter systems and their correct behavior under electromagnetic
interactions.

Note in the latter respect that curvature in isodual Riemannian spaces is negative–deﬁnite
(Sect. 2.7). Nevertheless, such negative value for antimatter-antimatter systems is referred
to a negative unit, thus resulting in attraction.

The universal symmetry of the isodual general relativity, the isodual isoPoincar`e symme-
try ˆP d(3.1) ≈ P d(3.1), has been introduced at the operator level in Ref. [6]. The construction
of its classical counterpart is straightforward, although it cannot be reviewed here because
it requires the broader isotopic mathematics, that based on generalized unit (2.39).

3.5 The prediction of antigravity.

We close this paper with the indication that the isodual theory of antimatter predicts the
existence of antigravity (here deﬁned as the reversal of the sign of the curvature tensor in
our space–time) for antimatter in the ﬁeld of matter, or vice–versa.

The prediction originates at the primitive Newtonian level, persists at all subsequent
levels of study [10], and it is here identiﬁed as a consequence of the theory without any

18

claim on its possible validity due to the lack of experimental knowledge at this writing on
the gravitational behavior of antiparticles.

In essence, antigravity is predicted by the interplay between conventional geometries and
their isoduals and, in particular, by Corollary 3.1.A according to which the trajectories we
observe for antiparticles are the projection in our space–time of the actual trajectories in
isodual space. The use of the same principle for the case of the gravitational ﬁeld then yields
antigravity.

Consider the Newtonian gravitational force of two conventional (thus positive) masses

m1 and m2

F = −G × m1 × m2/r × r < 0,

(3.31)

where the minus sign has been added for similarity with law (3.10).

Within the context of contemporary theories, the masses m1 and m2 remain positive
irrespective of whether referred to a particle or an antiparticle. This yields the well known
Newtonian gravitational attraction among any pair of masses, whether for particle–particle,
antiparticle–antiparticle or particle–antiparticle.

Under isoduality the situation is diﬀerent. First, the particle–particle gravitational force
yields exactly the same law (3.6). The case of antiparticle–antiparticle under isoduality
yields the diﬀerent law

F d = −Gd ×d md

1 ×d md
But this force is deﬁned with respect to the negative unit -1. The isoduality therefore
correctly represents the attractive character of the gravitational force among two antiparticles.
The case of particle–antiparticle under isoduality requires the projection of the antipar-
ticle in the space of the particle, as it is the case for the electromagnetic interactions of
Corollary 2.1.A

2/drd ×d rd > 0.

(3.32)

F = −G × m1 × md

2/r × r > 0,

(3.33)

(3.34)

which is now repulsive, thus illustrating the prediction of antigravity. Similarly, if we project
the particle in the space of the antiparticle we have

F d = −Gd ×d m1 ×d md

2/drd ×d rd < 0,

which is also repulsive because referred to the unit -1.

We can summarize the above results by saying that the classical representation of an-
tiparticles via isoduality renders gravitational interactions equivalent to the electromagnetic
ones, in the sense that the Newtonian gravitational law becomes equivalent to the Coulomb
law. Note the impossibility of achieving these results without isoduality.

The interested reader can verify the persistence of the above results at the relativistic

and gravitational levels.

We should indicate that the electroweak behavior of antiparticles is experimentally estab-
lished nowadays, while there no ﬁnal experimental knowledge on the gravitational behavior
of antiparticles is available at this writing.

19

A ﬁrst experiment on the gravity of antiparticles was done by Fairbank and Witteborn [20]
via low energy positrons in vertical motion, although the measurements were not conclusive
because of interferences from stray ﬁelds and other reasons.

Additional data on the gravity of antiparticles are those from the LEAR machine on
antiprotons at CERN [21], although these data too are inconclusive because of the excessive
energy of the antiprotons as compared to the low magnitude of gravitational eﬀects, the
sensitivity of the measures and other factors.

Other information on the gravity of antiparticles is of theoretical character, as reviewed,
e.g., in Ref. [22], which outlines various arguments against antigravity, such as those by
Morrison, Schiﬀ and Good and others. The latter arguments do not apply under isodualities
owing to their essential dependence on positive units, as one can verify.

The argument against antigravity based on the positronium [22] also do not apply under
isoduality, because systems of elementary particle–antiparticle are attracted in both ﬁelds of
matter and antimatter under the isodual theory, as studies in the joint paper [10].

Review [22] also indicates models in which the gravity of antimatter in the ﬁeld of matter

is weakened, yet it remains attractive.

experimentally unsettled at this writing.

We can therefore state that the gravitational behavior of antiparticles is theoretically and

The true scientiﬁc resolution is evidently that via experiments, such as that proposed
by Santilli [7] via the use of a suitably collimated beam of very low energy positrons in
horizontal ﬂight in a vacuum tube of suﬃcient length and diameter to yield a resolutory
answer, that is, a displacement under gravity at the end of the ﬂight up or down which is
visible by the naked eye.

According to Mills [12], the above experiment appears to be feasible with current tech-
nology via the use of µeV positrons in a horizontal vacuum tube of about 100 m in length
and 1 m in diameter for which stray ﬁelds and patch eﬀects should be small as compared to
the gravitational deﬂection. A number of additional experimental proposals to measure the
gravity of antiparticles are available in Proceedings [15], although their measures are more
sophisticated and not ”visible by the naked eyes” as test [7,12].

In closing we indicate that the most forceful argument favoring the existence of antigrav-
ity is given by studies on the origin of the gravitational ﬁeld. In fact, the mass of all particles
constituting a body has a primary electromagnetic origin, with second–order contributions
from weak and strong interactions. By using this established physical evidence, Ref. [23]
proposed the identiﬁcation (rather than the ” uniﬁcation ”) of the gravitational ﬁeld with the
ﬁelds originating mass. This can be done by identifying the τ –tensor in Eqs. (3.26) with the
electromagnetic ﬁeld originating mass, and the τ –tensor with the weak and strong contri-
butions. Since the latter are short range, in the exterior problem in vacuum we would only
have the identiﬁcation of the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds which would evidently
imply the equivalence of the respective phenomenologies, thus including the capability for
attractive and repulsive forces for both ﬁelds.

Note that this implies the existence of a ﬁrst–order nowhere null electromagnetic source
also for bodies with null total charge (see Ref. [23] for details). Note also the full compat-
ibility of the above argument with the isodual representation of antimatter, because both
approaches imply the equivalence of Coulomb’s law for charges with Newton’s law for masses.
The forceful nature of the above argument is due to the fact that the lack of antigravity

20

would imply the lack of identity of gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. In turn,
this would require a revision of the contemporary theory of elementary particles in such a
way to avoid the primary electromagnetic origin of their mass.

APPENDIX A.

A.1: Isodual Lagrangian mechanics.
After having veriﬁed the isodual theory of antimatter at the primitive Newtonian level,
it may be of some value to outline its analytic representation because it constitutes the
foundations of the novel quantization for antimatter studied in the joint paper [10].

A conventional (ﬁrst–order) Lagrangian L(t, x, v) = 1

2 mvkvk + V (t, x, v) on the con-
ﬁguration space E(t, x, v) = E(t, Rt) × E(r, δ, Rr) × E(v, δ, Rv) of Newton’s equations is
mapped under isoduality into the negative value Ld(td, rd, vd) = −L deﬁned on isodual
space Ed(td, rd, vd) of Eq. (3.2). The isodual Lagrange equations are then given by

dd
ddtd d

∂dLd(td, rd, vd)
∂dvkd

d −

∂dLd(td, rd, vd)
∂drkd

d = 0,

(A.35)

All various aspects of the isodual Lagrangian mechanics can then be readily derived.

It is easy to see that Lagrange’s equations change sign under isoduality and can therefore
provide a direct representation (i.e., a representation without integrating factors) of the
isodual Newton’s equations,

SA(t, r, v) = 0.

(A.36)

Where SA stands for variational selfadjointness, i.e., veriﬁcation of the conditions to be
derivable from a potential. The compatibility of the isodual Lagrangian mechanics with the
primitive Newtonian results then follows.

A.2: Isodual Hamiltonian mechanics.
The isodual Hamiltonian is evidently given by

H d = pd

k ×d pdk/d(2m)d + V d(td, rd, vd) = −H.

(A.37)

It can be derived from (nondegenerate) isodual Lagrangians via a simple isoduality of the
Legendre transforms and it is deﬁned on the 7–dimensional carrier space (for one particle)

Ed(td, rd, pd) = Ed(td, Rd

t ) × Ed(rd, δd, Rd) × Ed(pd, δd, Rd).

(A.38)

The isodual canonical action is given by

A◦d =

(pd

k ×d ddrkd − H d ×d ddtd) =

Z

[R◦d

µ (bd) ×d ddbµd − H d ×d ddtd], R◦ = {p, 0}, b = {x, p}, µ = 1, 2, ..., 6. (A.39)

Conventional variational techniques under simple isoduality then yield the isodual Hamilton
equations which can be written in disjoint form

ddxkd
ddtd =

∂dH d(td, xd, pd)
∂dpd
k

,

ddpd
k
ddtd = −

∂dH d(td, xd, pd)
∂dxdk

,

or in the uniﬁed notation

where ωd

µν is the isodual canonical symplectic tensor

µν ×d ddbdν
ωd

ddtd =

∂dH d(td, bd)
∂dbdµ

,

(ωd

µν) = (∂dR◦d

ν /d∂dbdµ − ∂dR◦d

µ /d∂dbdν) =

= −(ωµν).

(A.42)

I
0
−I 0 !

 

Note that in matrix form the canonical symplectic tensor is mapped into the canonical

Lie tensor.

The isodual Hamilton–Jacobi equations are then given by

∂dA◦d/d∂dtd + H d = 0, ∂dA◦d/d∂dxd

k − ˆpk = 0, ∂dA◦d/d∂dpd

k ≡ 0.

(A.43)

The isodual Lie brackets among two isodual functions Ad and Bd on Sd(td, xd, pd) then

become

where

[Ad, Bd]d =

∂dAd

∂dbdµ d ×d ωdµν ×d ∂dBd

∂dbdν d = −[A, B]

ωdµν = [(ωd

αβ)−1]µν,

is the isodual Lie tensor. The direct representation of the isodual Newton equations in
ﬁrst–order form is self–evident.

In summary, all properties of the isodual theory at the Newtonian level carry over at
the level of isodual Hamiltonian mechanics. In so doing, there is the emergence of a fun-
damental notion of these studies, the characterization of antimatter via isodual space–time
symmetries, i.e., the isodual Galilean symmetry Gd(3.1) for nonrelativistic treatments, the
isodual Poincar`e symmetry P d(3.1) for relativistic treatments and the isodual isoPoincar`e
symmetry for gravitational treatments [6].

Isodual naive quantization. The isodual Hamiltonian mechanics and its underlying
isodual symplectic geometry permit the identiﬁcation of the novel naive isodual quantization

A◦d → −id ×d ¯hd ×d Lndψd(td, rd),
∂dA◦d/d∂dtd + H d = 0 → id ×d ∂dψd/d∂dtd = H d ×d ψd = Ed ×d ψd,
∂dA◦d/d∂dxdk − ˆpk = 0 → pd

k ×d ψd = −id ×d ∂dψd,

or more reﬁned isodualities of symplectic quantization (see, e.g., Ref. [24] for the conventional
case), which characterize a novel image of quantum mechanics for antiparticles, called isodual
quantum mechanics, studied in the joint paper [10].

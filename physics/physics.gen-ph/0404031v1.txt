Abstract

The motion of a system of particles under electromagnetic interac-
tion is considered. Under the assumption that the force acting on an
electric charge is given by the sum of the electromagnetic ﬁelds pro-
duced by any other charged particles in its neighborhood, we prove
that the vector potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld has to be con-
sidered for the balance of kinetic momentum. The theory cannot be
quantized in the usual form—because it involves a mass matrix that
depends on spatial variables—and the Hamilton’s function becomes
singular at a distance equal to the geometric mean of the electrody-
namic radiuses of electrons and protons.

1 Introduction

In previous works [1] [2], we have shown that, according to classical
mechanics and electrodynamics: a neutral system of electric charges
that passes through a region where there is an inhomogeneous mag-
netic ﬁeld, experiences a force, even if its internal kinetic angular mo-
mentum is equal to zero. Given that this challenges the common in-
terpretation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment—as evidence that there
are intrinsic angular momenta—we have considered necessary to study
the motion of systems of electric charges where the internal magnetic
force is not neglected, as it is usual in common classical treatments.

1

In this paper we study the motion of electric charges under electro-
magnetic interaction. Neglecting radiative eﬀects, we assume that the
force acting on an electric charge is given by the sum of the electro-
magnetic ﬁelds produced by any other particles in its neighborhood.
From the invariance of the Lagrange’s function, we ﬁnd that the vec-
tor potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld must be considered for the
balance of linear and angular momentum, thus predicting a classical
Bohm-Aharonov Eﬀect.

A Hamilton’s function is obtained also for the system of two par-
ticles. The result is a theory that cannot be quantized but approxi-
mately in the usual form, since it involves a mass matrix that depends
on spatial variables. Also, the Hamilton’s function becomes singular
where the distance between the particles satisﬁes the relation:

r =

e2
c2(memp)1/2 .
For the sake of completeness, we include a section where the La-
grange’s function and the equations of motion for the center of mass
and the vector of relative position are obtained.

2 The General Law of Motion

We study the classical motion of an electron and a proton, under
electromagnetic interaction.

Neglecting any retardation and/or radiative eﬀects, we use the

formulas

φ(~x, t) =

q
k~x − ~r(t)k

and ~A(~x, t) =

q
c

~v(t)
k~x − ~r(t)k

,

to ﬁnd the electrodynamic potentials associated to a punctual charge
q moving along the path ~r(t). (Where ~v = d~r
dt .) The corresponding
electromagnetic ﬁeld is

~E(~x, t) = −∇φ −

~H(~x, t) = ∇ × ~A =

Further, we suppose—as it’s done when only Coulomb’s ﬁeld is
considered—that the force that acts on the electron is that due to
the proton’s electromagnetic ﬁeld, and vice versa. The equations of
motion are:

From equations 8, 10, and 11—and the identity ~a × (~b × ~c) = (~a ·~c)~b −
(~a ·~b)~c— we can easily prove that equation 8 is equivalent to equation
5.

where ~Ae(~r) and ~Ap(~r) are the vector potentials for the ﬁeld of the
electron and the ﬁeld of the proton, respectively.

The Lagrange’s function 7 is invariant under translations and ro-
tations of the reference system; therefore, the sum of the generalized
momenta

~pe + ~pp = me~ve + mp~vp −

~Ap(~re) +

~Ae(~rp),

(14)

and the total angular momentum (which is not equal to the kinetic
momentum and, therefore, the dipolar ﬁeld is not enough to describe
the magnetic properties of the system)

are constants of motion.
system,

In consequence, the center of mass of the

~L = ~re × ~pe + ~rp × ~pp,

~R =

me~re + mp~rp
me + mp

,

does not move according to Newton’s First Law. This was expected
given that equations 4 & 5 are not in compliance with Newton’s Third
Law either.

In the case of a system of n particles with masses m1, · · · , mn and

charges q1, · · · , qn, the Lagrange’s Function assumes the form

where ~Ai is the vector potential of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the
other particles.

Given that the function 17 is also invariant under arbitrary trans-
lations and/or rotations, we come again to the conclusion that the
sum of the generalized momenta and the angular momentum, are con-
stants of motion. Therefore, as it has been conﬁrmed by Bohm and
Aharonov[3], the vector potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld acting on
each particle must be considered for the balance of linear momentum.
The problem of gauge invariance is not an issue for us. Under the

this function coincides with the function used in [4] to approximate
the eigenvalues of the corresponding quantum system.

Further, we notice that 25 is singular where

r =

e2
c2(memp)1/2 .

At this distance the equations of motion 4 and 5 cannot be solved
for the accelerations, which is fundamental for the applicability of the
theorem of existence and uniqueness of solutions. Therefore, even
if the Principle of Least Action is valid, to determine a particular
solution additional conditions have to be imposed. There are another
two possibilities which we shall not investigate further in this paper:

1. That inequality 26 deﬁnes the limits of validity of electrodynam-

ics.

2. That a fully relativistic approach is required. In this case the
eﬀects of retardation have to be considered; the equations of mo-
tion are diﬀerence-diﬀerential equations; and there is not room
for a variational approach. (At least not for a variational ap-
proach that does not explicitly accounts for the action of the
entire electromagnetic ﬁeld.)

3 Separation of the Internal Motion

As it was shown before, the center of mass of the system does not
move according to Newton’s First Law. Notwithstanding, and for the
sake of completeness, we’ll carry out the decomposition of the motion

into the motion of the center of mass and an internal motion. Let’s
consider the substitutions:

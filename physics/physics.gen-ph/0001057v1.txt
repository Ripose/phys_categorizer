Abstract

In this paper, we apply Ritz variational approach to a new iso-
chemical model of H2 molecule suggested by Santilli and Shillady. We
studied Gaussian, Vg, and exponential, Ve, screened Coloumb poten-
tial approximations, as well as the original Hulten potential, Vh, case.
Both the Coloumb and exchange integrals have been calculated only
for Ve owing to Gegenbauer expansion while for Vg and Vh cases we
achieved analytical results only for the Coloumb integrals. We con-
clude that the Ve-based model is capable to ﬁt experimental data on
H2 molecule in conﬁrmation of the results of numerical HFR approach
by Santilli and Shillady. Also, we achieved the energy-based estima-
tion of the weight of the isoelectronium phase which is appeared to be
of the order of 1%...6%, for the case of Ve. However, we note that this
is not the result corresponding to the original Santilli-Shillady model,
which is based on the Hulten potential Vh. An interesting result is
that in order to prevent divergency of the Coloumb integral for Vh the
correlation length parameter rc should run discrete set of values. We
used this condition in our Ve-based model.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we consider the four-body Santilli-Shillady isochemical model
of H2 molecule [1, 2, 3] characterized by additional short-range attractive
Hulten potential between the electrons. This potential is assumed to lead
to bound state of electrons called isoelectronium. The restricted three-body
Santilli-Shillady model (stable and point-like isoelectronium) of H2 has been
studied in ref. [4], in terms of exact solution. For the mass of isoelectronium
M = 2me, this solution implied much lower energy than the experimental
one so we varied the mass and obtained that M = 0.308381me ﬁts the experi-
mental binding energy, Eexper[H2] = −1.174474 a.u. up to six decimal places,
although at bigger value of the internuclear distance, R = 1.675828 a.u. in
contrast to Rexper[H2] = 1.4011 a.u. We realize that the three-body model
is capable to represent the binding energy but it is only some approxima-
tion to the four-body model, and one should study the general four-body
hamiltonian of the Santilli-Shillady model as well.

In the present paper, we use Ritz variational approach to the four-body
Santilli-Shillady isochemical model of H2 molecule, i.e. without restriction
that the isoelectronium is stable and point-like particle, in order to ﬁnd the
ground state energy and bond length of the H2 molecule.

In Sec. 2, we analyze some features of the four-body Santilli-Shillady

isochemical model of H2 molecule.

In Sec. 3, we apply Ritz variational approach to the four-body Santilli-
Shillady model of H2 molecule. We calculate Coloumb integral for the
cases of Hulten potential (Sec. 3.1.1), exponential screened Coloumb po-
tential (Sec. 3.1.2), and Gaussian screened Coloumb potential (Sec. 3.1.3).
Owing to Gegenbauer expansion, exchange integral has been calculated for
the case of exponential screened potential, with some approximation made
(Sec. 3.1.4). Exchange integrals for the Hulten potential and the Gaussian
screened Coloumb potential have not been derived, and require more study.
We present main details of calculations of the Coloumb and exchange inte-
grals which have been appeared to be rather cumbersome, especially in the
case of Hulten potential.

In Sec. 3.2, we make numerical ﬁtting of the variational energy for the
case of exponential screened Coloumb potential Ve. Also, we estimate the
weight of the isoelectronium phase. However, we use all the important results
of the analysis made for the Hulten potential Vh.

1

1) We conclude that the Ve-based model with the one-level isoelectronium
is capable to ﬁt the experimental data on H2 molecule (both the binding
energy E and the bond length R). This is in conﬁrmation of the results of
numerical HFR approach (SASLOBE routine) to the Vg-based model of ref.
[1].

2) One of the interesting implications of the Ritz variational approach to
the Hulten potential case is that the correlation length parameter rc, entering
the Hulten potential, and, as a consequence, the variational energy, should
run discrete set of values during the variation. In other words, this means that
only some ﬁxed values of the eﬀective radius of the one-level isoelectronium
are admitted, in the original Santilli-Shillady model, within the framework of
the Ritz approach. This highly remarkable property is speciﬁc to the Hulten
potential Vh while it is absent in the Ve, or Vg-based models.

3) Also, we achieved an estimation of the weight of the isoelectronium
phase for the case of Ve-based model which is appeared to be of the order
of 1%...6%. This weight has been estimated from the energy contribution,
related to the exponential screened potential Ve, in comparison to the con-
tribution related to the Coloumb potential.

4) Another general conclusion is that the eﬀective radius of the isoelec-

tronium rc should be less that 0.25 a.u.

We note that the weight of the phase does not mean directly a time share
between the two regimes, i.e., 1...6% of time for the pure isoelectronium
regime, and 99...94% of time for the decoupled electrons regime. This means
instead relative contribution to the total energy provided by the potential Ve
and by the usual Coloumb potential between the electrons, respectively. As
a consequence, the weight of the isoelectronium phase, which can be thought
of as a measure of stability of the isoelectronium, may be

1. Diﬀerent from the obtained 1...6% when calculated for some other char-
acteristics of the molecule, e.g., for a relative contribution of the pure
isoelectronium to the total magnetic moment of the H2 molecule;

2. Diﬀerent from the obtained 1...6% for the case of the original Hulten

potential Vh.

So, the result of the calculation made in this paper is not the ﬁnal result
implied by the general four-body Santilli-Shillady model of H2 molecule since
the latter model is based on the Hulten potential Vh. This paper can be
viewed only as a preliminary study to it. However, we have made some

2

essential advance in analyzing the original Hulten potential case (Sec. 3.1.1),
which we have used in the Ve-based model.

Below, we describe the procedure used in Sec. 3 in a more detail.

In
Ritz variational approach, the main problem is to calculate analytically so
called molecular integrals. The variational molecular energy, in which we are
interested in, is expressed in terms of these integrals; see Eq.(3.2). These
integrals arise when using some wave function basis (usually it is a simple
hydrogen ground state wave functions) in the Schr¨odinger equation for the
molecule. The main idea of the Ritz approach is to introduce parameters into
the wave function, and vary them, together with the internuclear distance
parameter R, to achieve a minimum of the molecular energy.
In the case
under study, we have two parameters, γ and ρ, where γ enters hydrogen-
like ground state wave function (3.10), and ρ = γR measures internuclear
distance. These parameters should be varied (analytically or numerically) in
the ﬁnal analytical expression of the molecular energy, after the calculation
is made for the associated molecular integrals.

However, the four-body Santilli-Shillady model of H2 molecule suggests
additional, Hulten potential interaction between the electrons. The Hulten
potential contains two parameters, V0 and rc, where V0 is a general factor,
and rc is a correlation length parameter which can be viewed as an eﬀective
radius of the isoelectronium; see Eq. (3.23). Thus, we have four parameters
to be varied, γ, ρ, V0, and rc. The introducing of Hulten potential leads
to modiﬁcation of some molecular integrals, namely, of the Coloumb and
exchange integrals; see Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7). The other molecular integrals
remain the same as in the case of usual model of H2, and we use the known
analytical results for them. So, we should calculate the associated Coloumb
and exchange integrals for the Hulten potential to get the variational energy
analytically. In fact, calculating of these integrals, which are six-fold ones,
constitutes the main problem here. Normally, Coloumb integral, which can
be performed in bispherical coordinates, is much easier than the exchange
one, which is performed in bishperoidal coordinates.

Calculation of the Coloumb integral for Hulten potential, Vh, appeared
to be rather nontrivial (Sec. 3.1.1). Namely, we used bispherical coordinates,
and have faced several special functions, such as polylogarithmic function,
Riemann ζ-function, digamma function, and Lerch function, during the cal-
culation. Despite the fact that we see no essential obstacles to calculate this
six-fold integral, we stopped the calculation after ﬁfth step because sixth (the

3

last) step assumes necessity to calculate it separately for each integer value of
λ−1 ≡ (2γrc)−1, together with the need to handle very big number of terms.
During the calculations, we were forced to use the condition that λ−1 should
take integer values in order to prevent divergency of the Coloumb integral
for Hulten potential. Namely, some combination of terms containing Lerch
functions gives a ﬁnite value only if this condition holds. This condition is
speciﬁc to Hulten potential. Note also that we can not get general form
of a ﬁnal expression for the Coloumb integral for Hulten potential because
Lerch functions entering the intermediate expression (after the ﬁfth step, see
Eq.(3.80)) can be integrated over only for a concrete numerical value of their
third argument.

In order to proceed with the Santilli-Shillady approach, we invoke to two
diﬀerent simpliﬁed potentials, the exponential screened Coloumb potential,
Ve, and the Gaussian screened Coloumb potential, Vg, instead of the Hulten
potential Vh. They both mimic well Hulten potential at short and long
range asymptotics, and each contains two parameters, for which we use the
notation, A and rc. In order to reproduce the short range asymptotics of
Hulten potential the parameter A should have the value A = V0rc, for both
the potentials. The Coloumb integrals for these two potentials have been
calculated exactly (Secs. 3.1.2 and 3.1.3) owing to the fact that they are
much simpler than the Hulten potential. Particularly, we note that the ﬁnal
expression of the Coloumb integral for Vg contains only one special function,
the error function erf(z), while for Ve it contains no special functions at all.
Having these results we turned next to the most hard part of work: the
exchange integral. Usually, to calculate it one has to use bispheroidal coordi-
nates, and needs in an expansion of the potential in some orthogonal polyno-
mials, such as Legendre polynomials, in bispheroidal coordinates. Here, only
the exponential screened potential Ve is known to have such an expansion but
it is formulated, however, in terms of bispherical coordinates (the Gegenbauer
expansion). Accordingly, we calculated exactly the exchange integral for Ve,
at zero internuclear separation, R = 0, at which case one can use bispherical
coordinates. After that, we recovered partially the R dependence using the
standard result for the exchange integral for Coloumb potential (Sugiura’s
result). Thus, we achieved some approximate expression of the exchange
integral for the case of Ve. So, all the subsequent results correspond to the
Ve-based model.

Inserting obtained Ve-based Coloumb and exchange integrals into the to-

4

tal molecular energy expression, we get the ﬁnal analytical expression con-
taining four parameters, γ, ρ, A, and rc. Prior to going into details of the
energy minimization for the Ve-based (approximate) model, we analyze the
set of parameters, and the conditions which we derived in the original Hulten
potential case.

(1) From the analysis of Hulten potential, we see (Sec. 2.1) that the
existence of a bound state of two electrons (which is proper isoelectronium)
leads to the following relationship between the parameters for the case of
one energy level of the electron-electron system: V0 = ¯h2/(2mr2
c ). So, using
the above mentioned relation A = V0rc we have A = 1/rc ≡ 2γ/λ, in atomic
units (¯h = me = c = 1). Thus note that, in this paper, we conﬁned our
consideration to the case of one-level isoelectronium.

(2) From the analysis of the Coloumb integral for Hulten potential, we
see (Sec. 3.1.1) that the condition, λ−1 = integer number, should hold, and
one can use it as well.

We use the above two conditions, coming from the Hulten potential anal-
ysis, in the energy minimization calculations for the case of our Ve-based
model. The ﬁrst condition diminishes the number of independent parame-
ters by one (they become three, γ, ρ, and λ) while the second condition means
a discretization of the λ parameter, λ−1 = 4, 5, 6, . . . Here, we used the con-
dition λ−1 > 3 which we obtained during the calculation of the Coloumb
integral for Ve.

With the above set up, we minimized the total molecular energy of the
Ve-based model. Numerical analysis shows that the λ dependence does not
reveal any minimum, in the interval of interest, 4 < λ−1 < 60, while we have
a minimum of the energy at some values of γ and ρ. So, we calculated the
energy minima for diﬀerent values of λ, in the interval of interest, 4 < λ−1 <
60. Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. One can see that the binding
energy decreases with the increase of the parameter rc, which corresponds to
the eﬀective radius of the isoelectronium.

The following remarks are in order.
(i) Note that the discrete character of rc does not mean that the iso-
electronium is some kind of a multilevel system, with diﬀerent eﬀective
radia of isoelectronium assigned to the levels. We remind that we treat
the isoelectronium as one-level system due to the above mentioned relation
V0 = ¯h2/(2mr2
c ). In fact, this means that there is a set of one-level isoelec-
tronia of diﬀerent ﬁxed eﬀective radia from which we should select only one,

5

to ﬁt the experimental data.

(ii) The use of the exponential screened potential Ve can only be treated as
some approximation to the original Hulten potential, and, thus, to the original
Santilli-Shillady model of H2 molecule. So, the numerical results obtained
in Sec. 3.2 are valid only within this approximation. Hulten potential makes
a diﬀerence (one can see this, e.g., by comparing Sec. 3.1.1 and Sec. 3.1.2),
and it is worth to be investigated more closely by, for example, combination
of analytical and numerical methods.

(iii) The results obtained in ref. [1] are based on the Gaussian screened
Coloumb potential Vg approximation, to which the present work gives sup-
port in the form of exact analytical calculation of the Coloumb integral for Vg
(Sec. 3.1.3). Also, the present work gives possibility to make a comparative
analysis of ref. [1], due to some similarity of the used potentials, Ve and Vg.
(iv) Both the Coloumb integrals, for Ve and Vg, reveal a minimum in
respect with λ = 2γrc, i.e. in respect with rc (see Figures 6 and 9) since min-
imization in Ritz parameter γ is made independently. In principle, this gives
us an opportunity to minimize the total molecular energy Emol with respect
to rc. However, there are two reasons that we can not provide this minimiza-
tion. First, these minima correspond to rather large values of rc, namely,
rc ≥ 1 a.u. for Ve (Fig. 6), and rc > 2 a.u. for Vg (Fig. 9). Of course, this
is not an obstacle to do minimization but we note that we generally assume
that the eﬀective radius of the isoelectronium rc is much less than the inter-
nuclear distance, rc ≪ R = Rexper[H2] = 1.4011 a.u. Second, and the main,
reason is that for the exponential screened potential case (Sec. 3.1.2) the pa-
rameter λ should be less than 1/3 to provide convergency of the associated
Coloumb integral. Typically, γ ≃ 1.2, from which we obtain the condition
rc = λ/2γ < 0.2 a.u. Also, for the Hulten potential case (Sec. 3.1.1), we
obtained λ < 1/2, and hence rc < 0.25 a.u. This means that, in fact, it is
impossible to reach ﬁnite minimum of the total molecular energy Emol in re-
spect with rc since the Coloumb integrals blow up, at rc > 0.25 a.u., leading
thus to inﬁnite total energy Emol. So, in our approach we arrive at a strict
theoretical conclusion that the eﬀective radius of the isoelectronium rc must
be less than 0.25 a.u. Clearly, this supports our assumption that rc is much
less than the internuclear distance R.

2 Santilli-Shillady model and the barrier

In this Section, we consider the general four-body Santilli-Shillady model
[1] of H2 molecule, in Born-Oppenheimer approximation (i.e. at ﬁxed nu-
clei). Shr¨odinger equation for H2 molecule with the additional short range
attractive Hulten potential between the electrons is of the following form:

where r12 is distance between the electrons, V0 and rc are real positive pa-
rameters. Here, ﬁrst term, VC, is usual repulsive Coloumb potential, and the
second term, Vh, is an attractive Hulten potential.

(2.7)

Eq.(2.6) means expansion of Hulten potential with the use of Bernoulli coef-
ﬁcients.

Eq.(2.4) implies that to have an attraction near r12 = 0, which is necessary

for forming of isoelectronium, we should put the condition

(2.8)
We note that, in view of the asymptotics (2.4), Q = √V0rc can be thought
of as Hulten charge of the electrons.

V0rc > e2.

Under this condition, V (r12) has one maximum at the point deﬁned by
Eq.(2.3). This is the equilibrium point at which the Coloumb potential is
equal to the Hulten potential. So, we have barrier (B) separating two asymp-
totic regions, (A) r → 0 and (C) r → ∞, with Coloumb-like attraction and
Coloumb-like repulsion, respectively.
In the region A, attractive Hulten potential Vh dominates, and there-
fore two electrons form bound state (isoelectronium), while in the region C
Coloumb repulsion VC dominates, and they are separated. This separation is
limited by the size of the neutral molecule. For example, assuming that H2
molecule is in the ground state we have r ≤ rmol = 3.46 bohrs, where we have
assumed that separation between the protons is R = 1.46 bohrs = 0.77r12A.
Existence of the bound state of the electrons and of the barrier B is a
novel feature provided by the model. The asymptotic states, in regions A
and C, pertube each other due to the barrier eﬀect in region B.

2.1 Region A

In the case

V0rc ≫ e2

(2.9)
we can ignore Coloumb repulsion VC, and region A is a Hulten region, |Vh| ≫
|VC|; see Eq.(2.4). Then, exact solution of one-particle Schr¨odinger equation
with Hulten potential Vh, where wave function has the boundary conditions
ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(∞) = 0 (see [5], problem 68), can be used to establish the
relation between the parameters V0 and rc, and to estimate rc.

8

Energy spectrum for Hulten potential is given by

, n = 1, 2, . . . .

(2.10)

where

β2 =

2mV0
¯h2 r2
c ,

(2.11)

and m is mass of the particle. Assuming that there is only one energy level,
namely, ground state n = 1, we obtain the condition

which can be rewritten as

β2 = 1,

rc = ¯hs 1

2mV0

.

(2.12)

(2.13)

Note that this state is characterized by approximately zero energy, E1 = 0,
due to Eq.(2.10); strictly speaking, β2 must be bigger but close to 1 in
Eq.(2.12).

We should to note that the number of energy levels for Hulten potential
is always ﬁnite due to Eq.(2.10). Assumption that there are more than one
energy levels in the bound state of two electrons, i.e. that β > 1, leads to
drastical decrease of ground level energy E1 < 0, and relatively small increase
of characteristic size of isoelectronium in the ground state.

As the conclusion, the model implies ”quantization” of the distance be-
tween two electrons, r = r12, namely, forming of relatively small quasiparticle
(isoelectronium) characterized by total mass M = 2me, charge q = −2e, spin
zero, s = 0, and small size in the ground one-level state. This quasiparticle,
as a strongly correlated system of two electrons, moves in the potential of
two protons of H2 molecule, and one can apply methods developed for H +
2
ion, with electron replaced by isoelectronium, to calculate approximate en-
ergy spectrum of H2 [4]. However, this quasiparticle is not stable, being a
quasi-stationary state, due to ﬁnite height and width of the barrier B. So,
we must take into account eﬀects of both regions B and C to obtain correct
energy spectrum of H2 molecule, within the framework of the model.

9

2.2 Region B

Quasiclassically, due to smooth shape of the barrier, and because of expo-
nential decrease of wave functions inside the barrier, electrons are not much
time in region B, so we can ignore this transient phase in subsequent consid-
eration.

We should to point out that the existence of the bound state in the region
A and repulsion in the region C unavoidably leads to existence of the barrier.

2.3 Region C
In general, region C is inﬁnite, rC < r < ∞, where rC is the distance
between two electrons at which the Hulten potential is much smaller than
the Coloumb potential, |Vh| ≪ |VC|.
In this region, electrons are not strongly correlated, in comparison to
that in region A. Here, correlation is due to usual overlapping, Coloumb
repulsion, exchange eﬀects, and Coloumb attraction to protons. Shortly, we
have the usual set up as it for the standard model of H2 molecule.

Discarding, for a moment, eﬀects coming from the consideration of regions
A and B, we have ﬁnite motion of the electrons in region C. Namely, in the
ground state of H2, the distance between electrons is conﬁned by r = rmol =
3.46 bohrs. We restrict consideration by the ground state of H2 molecule.

Due to this ﬁniteness of the region C, r < rmol, two electrons on the same
orbit have constant probability to penetrate the barrier to form strongly
correlated system, isoelectronium, and vice verca.

2.4 Model of decay of isoelectronium

Below, we assume that the isoelectronium undergoes decay, and the resulting
two electrons are separated by suﬃciently large distance, in the ﬁnal state.
This leads us to consideration of the eﬀective life-time of isoelectronium. To
estimate the order of the life-time, we use ordinary formula for radioactive α-
decay since the potential V (r) is of the same shape, with very sharp decrease
at r < rmax and Coloumb repulsion at r > rmax. This quisiclassical model is a
crude approximation because in fact the electrons do not leave the molecule.
Moreover, we have the two asymptotic regimes simultaneously, with some
distribution of probability, and it would be more justiﬁed here to say on

10

frequency of the decay-formation process. However, due to our assumption
of small size of isoelectronium, in comparison to the molecule size, we can
study an elementary process of decay separately, and use the notion of life-
time.

Decay constant is

(2.14)

¯h = 1, e = 1, m = 1/2, Z = 1, rmax = 0.048, E = 1.

(2.15)

Here, E = 1 a.u. = 27.212 eV is double kinetic energy of the electron on ﬁrst
Bohr’s orbit, a0 = 0.529r12A, that corresponds approximately to maximal
relative kinetic energy of two electrons in ground state of H2, and m = 1/2
is reduced mass of two electrons.

We obtain the following numerical estimation for the life-time of isoelec-

tronium:

1/λ = D0 · 1.6 · 10−17 sec,

(2.16)
i.e. it is of the order of 1 atomic unit of time, τ = 2.42 · 10−17 sec. For lower
values of the relative energy E, we obtain longer lifetimes; see Table 2.
The quasiclassical model for decay we are using here is the following.
Particle of reduced mass m = 1/2 penetrate the barrier B. This means a
decay of isoelectronium. In the center of mass of electrons system, electrons
undergo Coloumb repulsion and move in opposite directions receiving equal
speed so that at large distances, r ≫ rmax, each of them have some kinetic
energy. This energy can be given approximate upper estimation using linear
velocity of electron on ﬁrst Bohr’s orbit, v = 2.19· 106 cm/sec, since electrons
are in the ground level of H2 molecule (this is the eﬀect of the nuclei). This
upper estimation corresponds to assumption of zero velocity of the center
of mass in respect to protons which we adopt here. Kinetic energy of the
particle of reduced mass is then double kinetic energy of electron, in center
of mass system.

As the conclusion, in the framework of the model, H2 molecule can be
viewed as a mixed state of H +
2 ion like system, i.e. strongly correlated phase
(Hulten phase), when electrons form isoelectronium, and standard model of

idently, the (statistical) weight of each phase depends on the characteristics
of the potential V (r12).

For extremally high barrier, only one of the phases could be realized with
some energy spectra in each phase, namely, either spectrum of H +
2 ion like
system (with electron replaced by isoelectronium), or usual spectrum of H2
molecule (without Hulten potential), respectively.

For high but ﬁnite barrier, each phase receives perturbation, and their
(ground) energy levels split to two levels corresponding to simultaneous re-
alization of both the phases. Note that the value Vmax is indeed high,
Vmax ∼ 500 eV, under the given values of the parameters.
In general, existence of the strongly correlated phase (isoelectronium)
leads to increase of the predicted dissociation energy, D, of H2 molecule.
Indeed, the mutual infuence of the regions A and C decreases the ground
energy level E of H2 due to the above mentioned splitting. The general
formula for D is

D = 2E0 − (E +

1
2

¯hω),

(2.17)

where 2E0 = −1 is total energy of two separated H atoms, and 1
2¯hω is zero
mode energy of the protons in H2. So, decreasing of E < 0 causes increase
of D.

It is remarkable to note that experimental data give dissociation energy

12

Dexper[H2] = 4.45 eV for H2 molecule (see, e.g.
[5] and references therein)
while theoretical predictions within the standard model are D = 2.90 eV
(Heitler-London), D = 3.75 eV (Flugge), and D = 4.37 eV (Hylleraas). We
observe that improvement of the variational approximation gives better ﬁts
but still it gives lower values (about 2% lower) partially due to the fact that
variational technique used there predicts generally bigger value (upper limit)
for the ground energy.

Below, we use the same Ritz variational technique as it had been used by
Heitler, London and Hylleraas but the feature of the model is the existence of
additional attractive short range potential between the electrons suggested
by Santilli and Shillady.

3 Variational solution for ground state en-

ergy of H2 molecule

In the limiting case of large distances between the nuclei, R → ∞, we have
the total wave function of the electrons in the form

|ψi = f (ra1)f (rb2) ± f (rb1)f (ra2),

(3.1)

where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the case when electron 1 is placed close to
nucleus a and f (ra1) is wave function of the corresponding separate H atom
while the second term corresponds to the case when electron 1 is placed close
to nucleus b. Symmetrized combination (′+′ sign) corresponds to antiparal-
lel spins of the electrons 1 and 2, and, as the result of the usual analysis,
leads to attraction between the H atoms. Below, we use this symmetrized
representation of the total wave function as the approximation to exact wave
function.

3.1 Analytical calculations

By using Ritz variational approach and representation (3.1), we obtain from
the Schr¨odinger equation (2.1) the energy of H2 molecule in the following
form (cf. [5]),

function), and r = ra1, rb1, ra2, rb2. With the help of γ we should make better
approximation to an exact wave function of the ground state. Namely, we
should calculate all the integrals presented above analytically, and then vary
the parameters γ away from the value γ = 1 and R in some appropriate
region, say 1 < R < 2, to minimize the energy (3.2). As the energy min-
imum will be identiﬁed the found value of the parameter R corresponds to

which can be taken as a second Ritz variational parameter in addition to
γ. The most hard part of work here is the exchange integral (3.15), which
was calculated for the ﬁrst time by Sugiura (1927), and contains one special
function, the exponential integral function E1(ρ).

Our problem is thus to calculate analytically the Hulten potential parts
of the Coloumb integral (3.5) and of the exchange integral (3.7), and then
vary all the Ritz variational parameters in order to minimize the ground state
energy (3.2),

Emol(parameters) = minimum.

(3.20)

In general, we have four parameters in our problem, Emol = Emol(γ, ρ, V0, rc),
with the ﬁrst two parameters characterizing inverse radius of electronic orbit

17

and the internuclear distance, respectively, and the last two parameters com-
ing from the Hulten potential. However, assuming that the isoelectronium
is characterized by one energy level, i.e. β = 1, we have the relation (2.13)
between V0 and rc so that we are left with three independent parameters, say,
Emol = Emol(γ, ρ, rc). In fact, we have three independent parameters for any
ﬁxed number β of the levels due to the general relation (2.11),

V0 =

β2¯h2
2mr2
c

,

β = 1, 2, . . . .

(3.21)

Behavior of the energy Emol as a function of γ and ρ is more or less clear
owing to known variational analysis of the standard model of H2 molecule.
Namely, Emol reveals a local minimum at some values of γ and ρ. Thus, we
should closely analyze the rc dependence of the energy which is speciﬁc to
the Santilli-Shillady model of H2 molecule.

Below, we turn to the Coloumb integral for the Hulten potential.

3.1.1 Coloumb integral for Hulten potential

To calculate the Hulten part of the Coloumb integral (3.5) we use spher-
ical coordinates, (rb2, θ2, ϕ2), when integrating over second electron, and
(rb1, θ1, ϕ1), when integrating over ﬁrst electron.

tively,

x = (rb1 − rb2)/rc,

rb1/rc < x < 0,

y = (rb2 − rb1)/rc,

L1 = Z dx e2γrcx ln(1 − ex)
L2 = Z dy e−2γrcy ln(1 − ey),

(3.37)

(3.38)

and

and diﬀerentiate them in parameter rc to reproduce I21 and I22. (One can
use parameter γ for this purpose, or introduce an independent parameter
putting it to one after making calculations, with the same result.) Namely,
by using deﬁnitions of L1 and L2 we have

that the Lerch function arises when dealing with Fermi-Dirac distribution,
e.g.,

(3.46)

Now, we have to use the above derivatives (3.45) and (3.46) of Lerch function
to obtain ﬁnal expressions for I21 and I22. Then, we should take the limits

x → rb1/rc, x → 0, and y → 0, y → ∞, respectively. The endpoints
x = rb1/rc and y = ∞ can be inserted easily, with the endpoint y = ∞
yielding zero, while the limits x → 0 and y → 0 require some care because
of the presence of some divergent terms.
To collect all the terms, we sum up I21 and (−1)I22 given by (3.47) and
(3.48), put x = y, and take common limit x → 0, inserting x = 0 for
polynomial and exponential (welldeﬁned) terms. We get

entering (3.51) are welldeﬁned. For example, at γ = 1.4 and rc = 0.0048, we
have

ζ(2,±2γrc) ≃ 5537,

ζ(3,±2γrc) ≃ 2462.

(3.53)

Now, we turn to close consideration of the limit (3.50) entering (3.51).
Let us calculate it for the particular value 2γrc = 1/100. Using expansion of
each term of B around x = 0, we obtain

B(

Using elementary properties of gamma function we obtain from Eq.(3.54)

B(

) = 100 − 2C − ψ(

) − ψ(

99

),

(3.56)

so one can see that the logarithmic divergent terms cancel each other, and
the limit is welldeﬁned for 2γrc = 1/100. The same is true for any integer
value of

k =

2γrc

(3.57)

while at noninteger k the limit B( 1

(3.58)

This highly remarkable result means that to have ﬁnite value of the
Coloumb integral we should use the condition that λ−1 ≡ (2γrc)−1 = k

is an integer number. Recalling that typically γ ≃ 1.5 and rc ≃ 0.01 we have
the integer number k ≃ 30.
Now, we turn to the next integral, I3. It is similar to I2 so that we present
the ﬁnal expression,

(3.66) and (3.67) in rc, we reproduce the second term of I41, up to a factor.
So, collecting these results and inserting x0 = rb1/rc we obtain after some
algebra

where ψ′(z) = dψ(z)/dz is derivative of digamma function.

To calculate I42 we use a similar method. However, care should be exerted
when taking limit y → 0. The basic integral, which we will use to calculate
I42, is

M2 = −Z dy e2γrcyLi2(e−y),

(3.69)

where we have replaced y → −y so that the endpoints will be due to 0 <
y < −∞. The result for M2 is
M2 =

3 e2γrcy(1 + 2γrceyΦ(ey, 1, 1 + 2γrc) + 2γrc ln(1 − e−y)− (3.70)

We should insert here the endpoints y = 0 and y = −∞.

In the limit

Φ(ey, 1, 1 + 2γrc) + ln(1 − e−y)|y→0 = −(

Now, we are ready to make integration over the last remaining variable, r, to
obtain complete analytical expression of the Coloumb integral for the Hulten
potential.

28

However, Lerch functions entering Eq.(3.80) make obstacle to do integral
(3.82) for a general case because they have diﬀerent functional form for dif-
ferent values of the parameter λ. So, each of the above integrals J1,2,3 should
be calculated independently for every numerical value of λ. Moreover, for
the values of interest, e.g., λ = 1/30, each Lerch function is expressed in the
form of sum of elementary functions with too big number of nontrivial terms
to handle them (incomplete Euler beta function arises here). So, the integral
cannot be reliably calculated even for a single value of λ, within the interval
of interest, λ = 1/30, 1/31, . . . , 1/100. Also, elementary analysis shows that
we can not implement the assumption of small rc into Eq.(3.80), to use ﬁrst
order approximation in rc. Indeed, Lerch functions in (3.80) contain rc both
in ﬁrst and third argument so that their asymptotics at rc → 0 make no
sense.
h getting,
however, as our main result the fact that (2γrc)−1 should be integer number,
in the variational approach to the model, to have ﬁnite energy of the ground
state. We consider this as very interesting result deserving rather involved
calculations made above.

Thus, we stop here further calculation of the Coloumb integral C′

Also, we have a detailed technical view on the problems which arise when
dealing with molecular integrals with the Hulten potential. Practically, this
means that there is a very little hope that the exchange integral (3.7), which
is structurally much more complicated than the above considered Coloumb
one, can be calculated exactly for the case of Hulten potential.

Because of these diﬃculties, below we use appropriate simpliﬁed poten-
tials, instead of Hulten potential, to have some analytical set up for the
variational analysis of the Santilli-Shillady model. Clearly, by this we go to
some approximation to the original Santilli-Shillady model.

3.1.2 Coloumb integral for exponential screened Coloumb poten-

tial

We use simple function to mimic Hulten potential. Namely, we approximate
the general potential (2.2) by

V (r12) = VC + Ve =

e2
r12 −

Ae−r12/rc

r12

,

(3.86)

29

where A and rc are positive parameters. It has similar behavior both at short
and long distances. Indeed, at long distances, r12 → ∞, we can ignore Ve and
the behavior is solely due to the Coloumb potential while its series expansion
about the point r12 = 0 (short distances) is

V (r12)|r12→0 =

e2 − A

(3.87)

Here, we should put A = V0rc to have the same coeﬃcient at r−1
in the
12
r12 → 0 asymptotics as it is in the case of Hulten potential; see Eq.(2.4).
Using Eq.(3.21) we have

A = V0rc =

β2¯h2

β = 1, 2, . . . ,

where β is a number of energy levels of isoelectronium. Taking β = 1 we
have, in atomic units (¯h = 1, m = me/2 = 1/2),

A =

tively. We use spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates (rb2, θ2, ϕ2),
with polar axis directed along the vector ~rb1, we have

r12 = qrb1

We use these coordinates when integrating over second electron. In spherical

totally cancel each other so the ﬁnal expression turns out to be automatically
ﬁnite.

3.1.4 Exchange integral

Our general remark is that all calculations for the above Coloumb integrals
are made in spherical coordinates, which correspond to spherical symme-
try of the charge distributions of both 1s electrons, |ψ(ra1)|2 and |ψ(ra2)|2,
each moving around one nucleus. One can use prolate spheroidal coordi-
nates, which are exploited sometimes when integrating over coordinates of
last electron, but we have encountered the same problem of big number of
terms in the intermediate expressions, with no advantage in comparison to
the use of spherical coordinates.

Unlike to Coloumb integral, calculation of exchange integral should be
made in the spheroidal coordinates, which correspond to spheroidal symme-
try of charge distributions of the electrons, ψ∗(ra1)ψ(rb1) and ψ∗(ra2)ψ(rb2),
each moving around both the nuclei, a and b.

Calculation of the exchange integral,

E ′ = Z dv1dv2 V (r12)f ∗(ra1)f (rb1)f ∗(ra2)f (rb2),

(3.131)

essentially depends on the form of the potential V (r12) in the sense that
the integration can be made only in spheroidal coordinates, (x1, y1, ϕ1) and
(x2, y2, ϕ2), and one should use an expansion of V (r12) in the associated
Legendre polynomials.

For the usual Coloumb potential, V (r12) = r−1

12 , it is rather long (about
12 pages to present the main details) and nontrivial calculation, where Neu-
mann expansion in terms of associated Legendre polynomials, in spheroidal
coordinates, is used (celebrated result by Sugiura, see Eq.(3.15)).

In general, any analytical square integrable function can be expanded in
associated Legendre polynomials. However, in direct calculating of the ex-
pansion coeﬃcients by means of integral of the function with Legendre poly-
nomials, one meets serious problems even for simple functions. Practically,
one uses, instead, properties of special functions to derive such expansions.
We mention that there is Gegenbauer expansion [6], having in a particular

case the form [5]

ﬁrst kind, respectively, θ12 is angle between vectors ~r1 and ~r2, and r1 = |~r1|,

41

r2 = |~r2|; r1 < r2. Spherical harmonics Yl,0(θ12) can be rewritten in terms of
Legendre polynomials due to the summation theorem.
We note that this expansion can be used, at k = i/rc, to reproduce ex-
ponential screened potential, Ve(r12), and to calculate associated exchange
integral (3.131) but, however, it concerns spherical (not spheroidal) coordi-
nates, (r1, θ1, ϕ1) and (r2, θ2, ϕ2).

For Hulten potential Vh(r12), exponential screened potential, Ve(r12), and
Gaussian screened potential, Vg(r12), which are of interest in this paper, we
have no such an expansion in spheroidal coordinates. To stress that this
is not only the problem of changing coordinate system, we mention that
the solution of usual 3-dimensional wave equation, ∆ψ + k2ψ = 0, is given
by function ei~k~r/r, in spherical coordinates, to which one can apply Gegen-
bauer expansion, while in spheroidal coordinates its solution is represented
by complicated function containing inﬁnite series of recurrent coeﬃcients [7];
see also [4], Sec. 3.4. As the result, we have no possibility to calculate exactly
exchange integrals for these non-Coloumb potentials.

In order to obtain approximate expression for the exchange integral for the
case of the above non-Coloumb potentials, we make analysis of asymptotics
of the standard exchange integral (i.e.
that for the Coloumb potential),
Eq.(3.15). It is easy to derive that

at long distances between the nuclei, and

(3.133)

(3.134)

in the case of coinciding nuclei. At r−1
c → 0, we should have the same
asymptotics for exchange integral for each of the above non-Coloumb poten-
tials because these potentials behave as Coloumb potential at r−1

In both the limiting cases, ρ → ∞ and ρ = 0, the exchange integral for the
non-Coloumb potentials is simpliﬁed, and one can use spherical coordinates
since the two-center problem is reduced to one-center problem. We consider
two limiting cases.
a) ρ = ∞ case.
This case is trivial because exchange integral tends to zero due to lack of

c → 0.

overlapping of the wave functions of two H atoms.

42

b) ρ = 0 case.
In this case , we have ra1 = rb1 = r1 and ra2 = rb2 = r2 so that Eq.(3.131)

becomes

E ′ = Z dv1dv2 V (r12)|f (r1)|2|f (r2)|2,

(3.135)

One can see that this is the case of He atom with two electrons in the ground
state. Evidently, in terms of our anzatz (3.1) we have complete overlapping
of the wave functions.

Even the above mentioned simpliﬁcation of the exchange integral and use
of spherical coordinates does not enable us to calculate straightforwardly the
integral (3.135) for the non-Coloumb potentials, Vh, Ve, or Vg; the integrands
are still too complicated. This indicates that we should use expansion of these
potentials in Legendre polynomials, in spherical coordinates, to perform the
integrals. Only exponential screened potential Ve is given such an expansion
here. Namely, this is Gegenbauer expansion (3.132), owing to which we can
calculate the exchange potential for exponential screened potential Ve, to
which we turn below.

tial Ve, at ρ = 0.

where we have used Eq.(3.134) for the usual Coloumb potential part of the

duce the potential Ve(r12). Since the wave functions f (r1) and f (r2) given by
Eq.(3.10) do not depend on the angles, only l = 0, m = 0 term of the expan-
sion (3.132) contributes to the exchange integral (3.136) due to orthogonality
of Legendre polynomials. Using

We have a good accuracy of the approximation (3.146). Indeed, exchange
integrals make sensible contribution to the total molecular energy at deep
overlapping of the wave functions, S > 0.5, and we have made calculation
just for the case of complete overlapping, S = 1, with the necessary asymp-
totic factor, e−2ρ, provided by E ′

we have Ve → A/r12. In addition, although there is no possibility to restore

got information on λ dependence, which is of most interest here.

3.2 Numerical calculations for the Ve-based model

In this Section, we consider the case of exponential screened potential Ve =
Ae−r12/rc/r, for which we have calculated all the needed molecular integrals.

where the speciﬁc terms are the Coloumb integral C′
e given by Eq.(3.107) and
the exchange integral E ′
e given by (3.146). We should ﬁnd extremum of Emol
as a function of our basic parameters, γ, R, A, and rc. We are using notation
ρ = γR and λ = 2γrc so that our four parameters are γ, ρ, A, and λ. In
general, the number of energy levels of isoelectronium can also be viewed
as a parameter of the model. However, we restrict our consideration by the
one-level case, β2 = 1; see Sec. 2.1.

3.2.1 Minimization of the energy

First, we analyze the A dependence of Emol. Due to Eq.(3.89), for one-level
isoelectronium we have A = r−1

, that can be identically rewritten as

c

A =

(3.148)

Thus the A dependence converts to γ and λ dependence. This is the conse-
quence of consideration of the Hulten potential interaction for the electron
pair made in Sec. 2.1.

47

Second, we turn to γ dependence. Due to (3.148), the A dependent parts,
e, acquire additional γ factor and thus become γ2 dependent. The
C′
e and E ′
other molecular integrals depend on γ linearly so that we deﬁne accordingly,

are forced to use numerical calculations.

Figure 14: The total energy E = Emol as a function of ρ, Eq. (3.156), at
λ = 1/60, 1/40, 1/20, 1/10, 1/5. The lowest plot corresponds to λ = 1/5
(ρ = γR, λ = 2γrc).

It appears that the λ dependence does not reveal any local energy mini-
mum while the ρ dependence does. Below, we use the condition, λ−1 = in-
teger number, obtained during the calculation of the Coloumb integral with
Hulten potential Vh; see Eq.(3.57). Although there is obviously no necessity
to keep this condition for the case of exponential screened potential Ve, we
consider it as a prescription for allowed values of λ.

Since the λ dependence of the energy has no minimum we can use ﬁtting
of the predicted energy Emol(λ) to the experimental value by varying λ. This
allows us to estimate the value of the parameter λ, and thus the value of the
eﬀective radius of the isoelectronium rc = λ/2γopt.

3.2.2 Fitting of the energy and the bond length

The procedure is the following. We ﬁx some numerical value of λ, and iden-
tify minimal value of Emol(ρ, λ), given by Eq.(3.156), in respect with the
parameter ρ. This gives us minimal energy and corresponding optimal value
of ρ, at some ﬁxed value of λ. Then, we calculate γopt by using Eq.(3.155),
and use obtained values of ρopt and γopt to calculate values of Ropt and rc.

49

We calculated minimal values of Emol in ρ, for a wide range of integer
values of λ−1. The results are presented in Tables 2 and 3, and Figures 15
and 16. One can see that the energy Emol decreases with the increase of rc
(proportional to size of isoelectronium), as it was expected to be.

We note that all the presented values of Emol in Tables 2 and 3 are lower
than that, Evar
mol = −1.139 a.u., obtained via two-parametric Ritz variational
approach to the standard model of H2 (see, e.g., [5]), which is the model
without the assumption of short-range attractive potential between the elec-
trons. This means that the Ve-based model gives better prediction than the
one of the standard model, for any admitted value of the eﬀective radius of
isoelectronium rc > 0. Indeed, the standard prediction Evar
mol = −1.139 a.u.
is much higher than the experimental value Eexper[H2] = −1.174474 a.u.

3.2.3 The results of ﬁtting

Best ﬁt of the energy Emol.

Due to Table 2 (see also Fig. 15), the experimental value, Eexp[H2] =
−1.174... − 1.164 a.u. (here we take 0.9% uncertainty of the experimental
value) is ﬁtted by
(3.157)

rc = 0.0833...0.0600 a.u.,

i.e. λ = 1/5...1/7, with the optimal distance, Ropt = 1.3184...1.3441 a.u.
We see that the predicted Ropt appeared to be about 6% less than the ex-
perimental value Rexper[H2] = 1.4011 a.u. We assign this discrepancy to the
approximation we have made for the exchange integral (3.146).

Below we ﬁt Ropt, to estimate the associated minimal energy.

Best ﬁt of the internuclear distance R.

Due to Table 2 (see also Fig. 16), the experimental value of the inter-
nuclear distance, Rexp = 1.4011 a.u., is ﬁtted by rc = 0.0115 a.u., with the
corresponding minimal energy Emin = −1.144 a.u., which is about 3% big-
ger than the experimental value. Again, we assign this discrepancy to the
approximation we have made for the exchange integral (3.146), and take

rc = 0.0115 a.u.,

(3.158)

50

i.e. λ = 1/37, as the result of our ﬁnal ﬁt noting that (a) in ref. [1] the value
rc = 0.0112 a.u. has been used to make exact numerical ﬁt of the energy,
with corresponding R = 1.40 a.u., and (b) we have less discrepancy.

The weight of the pure isoelectronium phase.

To estimate the weight of the pure isoelectronium phase, which can be
viewed as a measure of stability of the pure isoelectronium state, we use the
above obtained ﬁts and the fact that this phase makes contribution to the
total molecular energy via the Coloumb and exchange integrals.

According to Eq.(3.147), the isoelectronium phase displays itself only by
the term Pe ≡ |C′
e(γ, ρ, λ)| while the Coloumb phase displays
itself by the corresponding term PC ≡ |C′
C(γ, ρ)|. Putting the

The weight for the best ﬁt of R.

At the values λ = 1/37 (i.e. rc = 0.0115), γ = 1.1706, and ρ = 1.6320, for
which we have minimal Emol = −1.144 and optimal R = 1.40, we get the
numerical values of the weights,

We = 0.84%

(3.160)

for the pure isoelectronium phase, and WC = 100% − We = 99.16% for the
Coloumb phase.

The weight for the best ﬁt of Emol.

At the values λ = 1/5 (i.e. rc = 0.0833 a.u.), γ = 1.2005, and ρ = 1.5827,
for which we have minimal Emol = −1.173 a.u. and optimal R = 1.318 a.u.,
we obtain
(3.161)

We = 6.16%, WC = 93.84%.

From the above two cases, one can see that the weight of pure isoelectronium
phase is estimated to be

We ≃ 1...6%,

(3.162)

for the predicted variational energy Emol = −1.143... − 1.173 a.u.
Note that in our Ve-based model the biggest allowed value of λ is λ = 1/4

The biggest possible weight.

(i.e. rc = 0.1034) because λ < 1/3, to avoid divergency of the Coloumb
integral Ce. For this value of λ, we obtain minimal Emol = −1.182 a.u. and
optimal R = 1.297 a.u. This value corresponds to the biggest possible weight
of the pure isoelectronium phase,

We = 7.32%,

(3.163)

within our approximate model.

The following three remarks are in order.
(i) We consider the existence of this upper limit, We ≤ 7.32%, as a highly
remarkable implication of our Ve-model noting however that it may be artifact
of the use of the exponential screened Coloumb potential.

(ii) Another remarkable implication is due to the condition, λ−1 = integer
number, obtained for the case of Hulten potential. One can see from Table 2
that the energy Emol varies discretely with the discrete variation of λ−1. This
means that there is no possibility to make a “smooth ﬁt”. For example, at
λ = 1/5, we have Emol = −1.173, and the nearest two values, λ = 1/4 and
λ = 1/6, give us Emol = −1.182 and Emol = −1.167, respectively. Therefore,
owing to the above condition the model becomes more predicitive.
(iii) Numerical calculation shows that the formal use of the exact Coloumb
integral C′
g, given by Eq.(3.128), of the Gaussian screened Coloumb potential,
instead of C′
e, in Eq.(3.147) gives us approximately the same ﬁts. Namely,
the best ﬁt of the energy is achieved at λ = 1/5, with rc = 0.1042, optimal
R = 1.323, and minimal Emol = −1.172. Also, the best ﬁt of R = 1.40
is at λ = 1/29, for which rc = 0.0147 and minimal Emol = −1.144. Here,
we have used the same exchange integral as it is for the case of exponential
screened potential so these ﬁts have been presented just for a comparison with
our basic ﬁts, and to check the results. Note that for the case of Gaussian
screened Coloumb integral we have no restriction on the allowed values of λ.
Analysis shows that, at big values of λ, e.g. at λ > 4, the integral C′
g, given
by (3.128), rapidly oscillates in the region of small ρ (ρ < 0.5). This means
that when the correlation length rc becomes comparable to the internuclear
distance an eﬀect of instability of the molecule arises. This can be viewed as
a natural criterium to ﬁx the upper limit of λ. Normally, we use the values
λ < 1, for which case there are no any oscillations of C′

g (see Fig. 9).

Various models are under consideration with metric type ﬂat FRW i.e. with k=0 whose energy-
momentum tensor is described by a perfect ﬂuid whose generic equation state is p = ωρ and taking
into account the conservation principle div(Tij) = 0, but considering some of the “constants” as
variable. A set of solutions through dimensional analysis is trivially found. The numeric calcula-
tions carried out show that the results obtained are not discordant with those presently observed for
cosmological parameters. However, the model seems irreconcilable with electromagnetic and quantum
quantities. This makes us think that we are working with faulty hypothesis from the start.

Key words: FRW cosmologies, variable constants.

I. INTRODUCTION.

In a recent paper (see [1]) a study was carried out of
the behaviour of G and Λ “constants” in the framework
described by a cosmological model with ﬂat FRW sym-
metries and whose moment-energy tensor was described
by a perfect ﬂuid whose state equation is : (p = ωρ /
ω = const.) taking into account the conservation princi-
ple. In light of coincidences encountered with O’Hanlon
and Tam’s work (see [2]) it was decided to demonstrate
that we could also reach the same results as those of
the authors in the case of a model describing a Universe
with predominance of matter. With the hypothesis car-
ried out in previous work (see [1]) i.e. the only real con-
stants taken into consideration are the speed of light c
and the Boltzmann constant kB. In this work the “con-
stants” G, , a, e, mi and Λ are considered as scalar func-
tions dependent on time showing that one of our models
reaches the same results of those of O’Hanlon and Tam.
It should also be pointed out how the use of Dimensional
Analysis (DA) enables us to ﬁnd in a trivial way, a set of
solutions to this type of models with k = 0 y taking into
account the conservation principle, as it will be seen that
the diﬀerent equations posed are not trivially integrable,
but “without going overboard” as the method has certain
limitations. The numerical calculations carried out show
that the results obtained are not discordant with those
presently observed for cosmological parameters, however,
the model seems irreconcilable with electromagnetic and
quantum quantities. The idea of being able to unite in
one ﬁeld both gravitation and the rest of the forces has
been, since the beginning of the century, a very active
ﬁeld of work. The inconsistencies observed in our mod-
el makes us think “momentaneously” that the approach
to the problem is inadequate, that is to say, that we are
working with faulty hypothesis from the start.

The paper is organized as follows: In the second sec-

1

tion the equations of the model are presented and some
small considerations on the dimensional method followed
are made. In the third section, use is made of dimension-
al analysis to obtain a solution to the main quantities
appearing in the model. In the fourth section two specif-
ic models are studied - one with radiation predominance
and the other with matter predominance and ﬁnally in
the ﬁfth section a brief summary and concise conclusions
are made.

II. THE MODEL.

The modiﬁed ﬁeld equations are as follows:

Rij −

1
2

gijR − Λ(t)gij =

8πG(t)

c4

Tij

(2.1)

and it is imposed that:

div(Tij) = 0

where Λ(t) represent the cosmological “constant”. The
basic ingredient of the model are:

1. The line element deﬁned by:

ds2 = −c2dt2+f 2(t)(cid:20) dr2

1 − kr2 + r2(cid:0)dθ2 + sin 2θdφ2(cid:1)(cid:21)

we only consider here the case k = 0.

2. The energy-momentum tensor deﬁned by:

Tij = (ρ + p)uiuj − pgij

p = ωρ

where ω is a numerical constant such that ω ∈ [0, 1]

Whit this supposition the equation that govern the

model are as follows:

2

f ′′
f

(f ′)2
f 2 = −

8πG(t)

c2

p + c2Λ(t)

(2.2)

3

(f ′)2
f 2 =

8πG(t)

c2

ρ + c2Λ(t)

(2.3)

{L, M, T, θ} where θ stands for dimensions of tempera-
ture. The dimensional equations of each of the governing
parameters is:

div(Tij) = 0 ⇔ ρ′ + 3(ω + 1)ρ

f ′
f

= 0

(2.4)

[t] = T

[c] = LT −1

[Aω] = L2+3ωM T −2

integrating equation (2.4) it is obtained the well-known
relationship.

ρ = Aωf −3(ω+1)

(2.5)

where f represent the scale factor that appear in the
metric and Aω is the constant of integration that has
diﬀerent dimensions and physical meaning depending on
the state equation imposed i.e. depends on ω.

Following the Kalligas et al‘s work (see [3]), if we derive
equation (2.3) and it is simpliﬁed with (2.2) it is obtained
the relationship:

Gρ′ + 3(1 + ω)ρG

f ′
f

+ ρG′ +

Λ′c4
8π

= 0

(2.6)

From equations (2.6) and (2.4) we obtain the next

equation that relate G with Λ

G′ = −

Λ′c4
8πρ

(2.7)

from all these relationship it is obtained the following
diﬀerential equation that it is not immediately integrated
(see [3]):

ρ′ρ′′

ρ (cid:19)3
ρ2 −(cid:18) ρ′

= 12π(ω + 1)2 Gρ′
c2

(2.8)

for this reason we utilize the dimensional method. This
equation also we can integrate through similarity and di-
mensional method following a well- established way to
integrate pde and odes. This last option is studied in
other paper (see [4]). In this case we work a naive Di-
mensional Analysis.

The followed dimensional method needs to make these
distinctions. It is necessary to know beforehand the set
of fundamental quantities together with one of the un-
avoidable constant (in the nomenclature of Barenblatt
designated as governing parameters).
In this case the
only fundamental quantity is the cosmic time t as can be
easily deduced from the homogeneity and isotropy sup-
posed for the model. The set of unavoidable constant are
in this case the speed of light c, the integration constant
Aω (obtained from equation (2.5) that depending on the
state equation will have diﬀerent dimensions and physi-
cal meaning) and the Boltzman constant kB that will be
taking into account to relate thermodynamics quantities
In a previous paper (see [5]) the dimensional base
was calculated for this type of models, being this B =

[kB] = L2M T −2θ−1

All the derived quantities will be calculated in function
of these governing parameters, that is say, in function of
the cosmic time t and the set of unavoidable constants
c, kB and Aω with respect to the dimensional base B =
{L, M, T, θ} .

III. SOLUTIONS THROUGH D.A.

We are going to calculate through dimensional analysis
D.A. i.e. applying the Pi Theorem, the variation of G(t)
in function on t and temperature θ, G(θ) (see [6]), the
Planck’s constant (t),the radiation constant a(t), the
charge of the electron e(t), the mass of an elementary par-
ticle mi(t), the variation of the cosmological “constant”
Λ(t), the energy density ρ(t), the matter density ρm(t),
the radius of the universe f (t), the temperature θ(t), the
entropy S(t) and ﬁnally the entropy density s(t)

A. Calculation of G(t).

As we have indicated above, we are going to ac-
complish the calculation of the variation of G applying
the Pi theorem. The quantities that we consider are:
G = G(t, c, Aω). with respect to the dimensional base
B = {L, M, T, θ} . We know that [G] = L3M −1T −2

Through a direct aplication of Pi Theorem we obtain
a single monomial that leads to the following expression
for G

G(t) ∝

t1+3ωc5+3ω

Aω

(3.1)

If we want to relate G with θ (see [6]) the solution
that DA give us is: G = G(t, c, Aω, a, θ). We need to
introduce a new dimensional “constant” a, in this case
thermodynamics, to relate the temperature whit the rest
of quantities. The same result is obtained if we consider
kB.

[mi] = M

kBθ(t) ∝ Aωc−3ωt−3ω

mi(t) ∝ Aωc−2−3ωt−3ω

(3.6)

we may check that this relationship is veriﬁed:

ρ = aθ4 = Aω(ct)−3(ω+1) = Aω(f )−3(ω+1)

it is observed that not depends on Aω i.e.

both models.

IV. DIFFERENT CASES.

All the following cases can be calculated without dif-
ﬁculty. Two speciﬁc models are studied: in ﬁrst place a
universe with radiation predominance which corresponds
to the imposition of ω = 1/3 in the state equation; and in
second place a model describing a universe with matter
predominance corresponding to the imposition of ω = 0
as state equation.

H. Calculation of the radius of the Universe f (t).

f = f (t, c, Aω) where its dimensional equation is [f ] =

L =⇒

f (t) ∝ ct

(3.9)

it is observed that no depends on Aω i.e. is not depend
on state equation. This solution is valid for both models.
Then:

A. Model with radiation predominance

In this case the behaviour of the “constants” obtained

is the following:

G(t) ∝ A−1

ω t2c6

G ∝ t2

G ∝ c4 (Aωa)− 1

2 θ−2

G ∝ θ−2

 ∝ Aωc−1t0

 ∝ const.

a ∝ k4

e2ǫ−1

0 ∝ const.

mi ∝ Aωc−3t−1

mi ∝ t−1

Λ ∝ c−2t−2

Λ ∝ t−2

While the result obtained for the rest of quantities is:

f ∝ ct

f ∝ t

ρ ∝ Aω (ct)−4

ρ ∝ t−4

θ ∝ k−1

B Aωc−1t−1

θ ∝ t−1

S ∝ (cid:0)A3
ωa(cid:1)
4 (ct)−3
s ∝ (cid:0)A3
ωa(cid:1)

1

S ∝ const.

s ∝ t−3

In the ﬁrst place it should be pointed out that with re-
gard to the values obtained for G, Λ, f, ρ and θ the same
were obtained as those already found in literature (see [3],
[7], [8] and [9]) demonstrating in this way that DA is a
good tool for dealing with these types of problems. In the
same way the result obtained for G(θ) ∝ θ−2 coincides
with that obtained by Zee (see [6]). It is proven, amazing-
ly, that the result obtained for the remainder of the “con-
stants” is that these are constant in the model in spite of
considering them as variable, with the exception of the
mass of an elemental particle which varies as mi ∝ t−1.
Observe that with regards to the “indissoluble” relation-
ship e2ǫ−1
0 ∝ const. it can be said that e2 ∝ ǫ0 in such a
way that the product e2ǫ−1
0 ∝ const. remains constant. If
Moller and Landau et al ‘s observations (see [10]) are tak-
en into account, in which the following relation ǫ0 ≈ f (t)
is shown , in our case ǫ0 ≈ f (t) ∝ t we therefore ﬁnd
that e2 ∝ ǫ0 ∝ t of the relation c2 = (1/ǫ0µ0) we obtain

B

ǫ0 ∝ µ−1
0 . In the same way the following coincidences can
be observed:  ∝ Aωc−1being and a ∝ k4
c3h3 if substituted
the expression obtained though D.A. i.e. a ∝ k4
ω can
be recovered and results consistent. On the other hand,
from the relation e2ǫ−1
0 ∝ Aω and  ∝ Aωc−1 it can be
seen that e2ǫ−1
0 ∝ c a relation known by all. All these
results are coherent with the behaviour of all energies,
as E = kBθ ∝ t−1 , E = mc2 ∝ t−1if not this relation
would be constant ¡! E = γ ∝ t−1 and the total Borh
energy ET B = me4

2 ∝ t−1.

BA−3

ǫ2
0

It will now be checked if the results obtained are com-

patible with the observational data available.

From the equation (2.5) the value of the constant
Aω is obtained (as in this model ω = 1/3 thus the
denomination henceforth will be as A1).
It is known
that ρ ≈ 10−13.379Jm−3 and f ≈ 1028m with this da-
ta A1 ≈ 10100.5m3kgs−2 is obtained. With this value
of A1 it is checked whether the value of G predicted
by our model is obtained. As G(t) ∝ A−1
ω t2c6 where
c ≈ 108.47ms−1 and t ≈ 1020s

G(t) ∝ A−1

ω t2c6 ≈ 10−10.17m3kg−1s−2

i.e. our model is capable of recovering the value presently
accepted of the “constant” G. If we proceed in the same
way with the formula for G(θ) a value for G about G ≈
10−9.562m3kg−1s−2 is obtained i.e. a little below that
presently observed. With regards to the cosmological
if t ≈ 1020s and c ≈
“constant” it is observed that :
108.4ms−1 ⇒ Λ ≈ 10−56m−2 which corresponds to that
presently accepted.

If the value obtained for A1 is taken into account it
can be seen with ease that the following value of the
cosmic background radiation temperature is obtained
i.e θ ≈ 100.4361K if the “constant” a takes a value of
1
a ≈ 10−15.1211Jm−3K −4 in the expression a
4 θ(t) ∝
ω (ct)−1 i.e. we can also deduce through this result
A
the value presently accepted of the cosmic background
radiation temperature also recovering the expression for
energy density ρ = aθ4. Finally it should be pointed out
that our model is without the nominated problem of hori-
zon although it is not yet rid of the problem of entropy,
also constant here.

For the moment , we can see that the model works
well (fantastic) but we shall now see how it functions
with respect to the electromagnetic and quantum con-
stants. With the values calculated previously we observe,
much to our disappointment, that we do not obtain (with
the expressions indicated) any of the values presently ac-
cepted for each of these “constants”. For example we
see that  ∝ A1c−1 ≈ 1091.5Js−1 while for the radia-
tion constant a ∝ k4
ω ≈ 10−300 m−1kgs−2K −4 and
e2ǫ−1
0 ∝ A1 ≈ 10100.5 m3kgs−2 i.e. we are obtaining
totally “preposterous results”. We can see that we are

BA−3

4

unable to reconcile our results with the present values of
the said “constants”.

Let us think now in a diﬀerent way: from the relation
e2ǫ−1
0 ∝ A1 we obtain the value of the constant A1which
we shall now call A′
1 to avoid as far as possible confusion
through excessive notation. The value of this new con-
1 ≈ 10−26m3kgs−2.so with this
stant is in the region of A′
value of A′
1 we can recover the present values both of 
and a but none of the cosmological parameters such as
G, ρ etc. how strange.

We can see that even if by one path we can perfectly
describe the cosmological parameters G, f, ρ, θ and Λ we
cannot recover the values of , a, e, ǫ0 etc. and vice versa.
This makes us think that this approach (I can now dare
to qualify it as simplistic as it is indeed a “toy model”) is
not correct and that previous hypothesis should be taken
into account or perhaps create an adequate theoretical
framework capable of describing both worlds ... ( I think
we have rediscovered America!).

However, the approach displayed here is not totally
wild for the following reasons: J.A. Wheeler (see [11])
stated that if the constants of Physics must vary, these
would do so in function of universal time. This time is
our universal time function which we can deﬁne in our
model as we have built it through a FRW metric type
i.e. that our ST space-time can be foliated in 3-spaces
and these are diﬀerent from one another in the value of
slice-labeling i.e. trK. The uranian mine in Gabon has
given the evidence necessary to be able to aﬃrm that
the masses and charges of particles have changed with
time, but which time? Proper or universal? One can
suddenly think that we are talking about proper time as
changes of masses and charges are proper ones! The col-
lapse syndrome puts a limit in the region of 10−37/year
on the variation of the charge of the electron e (with re-
spect to proper time). A more thorough analysis of this
last section shows a series of diﬃculties “the collapse syn-
drome” hindered by Pauli’s exclusion principle. The idea
expressed by Wheeler is, therefore, that the “constants”
vary with respect to universal time and not proper time.
This argument sets universal time in a place of privilege
in the argument about the “change” in microphysics on
cosmological scales. On the other hand, as previously in-
dicated, Moller and Landau et al (see [10])) have shown
a relation, now ﬁrmly established , by which ǫ0 should
vary according to the radius of the universe, ǫ0 ≈ f (t) .

For all these reasons we have decided to carry out a
similar study (i.e. it seems our suppositions are not com-
pletely preposterous) however, the results obtained sur-
prise us.

B. Model with matter predominance.

In this case the behaviour of the “constants” obtained

is the following:

G(t) ∝ A−1

ω c5t

G ∝ t

 ∝ Aωc0t

 ∝ t

a ∝ k4

BA−3

ω c−3t−3

a ∝ t−3

e2ǫ−1

0 ∝ Aωct

e2ǫ−1

0 ∝ t

mi ∝ Aωc−2t0

mi ∝ const.

Λ ∝ c−2t−2

Λ ∝ t−2

While the result obtained for the rest of quantities is:

f ∝ ct

f ∝ t

ρ ∝ Aω (ct)−3

ρ ∝ t−3

θ ∝ k−1

B Aωc0t0

θ ∝ const.

1
4

ωa(ct)3(cid:1)
4 (ct)−9/4

1

S ∝ (cid:0)A3

s ∝ (cid:0)A3
ωa(cid:1)

S ∝ t3

s ∝ t−9/4

In the same way as for the previous model it is seen
that with respect to quantities G, f, ρ and Λ the same
results found in literature (see [3], [8] and [9]) are ob-
tained. With regards to the rest of “constants” studied
we see that in this case they do vary.

In particular regarding G, , e and ρ the same results
as O’Hanlon et al (see [2]) are obtained. These authors
set out from the Dirac model , its LNH, and by means of
some pertinent modiﬁcations ﬁve dimensionless numbers
are obtained, in the same way as that of the Dirac model,
but this time reaching totally diﬀerent results. With their
ﬁve dimensionless numbers together with the hypothesis
that the mass of the universe is constant (we do not need
to make a similar hypothesis, the model tells us mi ∝
const.) they are brought to the only way in which G, e2
and  vary. The ρ average density of the universe mass
varies thus ρ ∝ t−3 while G ∝ t, e2 ∝ t and  ∝ t while
energy is conserved. This models responds, at the same
time, to the axioms of Milne’s Kinematic Relativity (see
[12]).

If ρ is considered as mass density then Aω (constant
denoted by A0) [A0] = M represents the universe mass,
and the expression G(t) remains thus:

G ∝ Aωc3t

G ∝ t

verifying the Sciama formula ρGt2 ≈ 1 (on inertia). Fur-
thermore if we take into account the numeric values of the
constant and the quantity t we obtain the present value of
G ≈ 10−10.1757m3kg−1s−2 i.e. t ≈ 1020s, c ≈ 108.5ms−1
and A0 ≈ 1056kg. This result was already obtained by
Milne in 1935 (see [12]). In the same way as in the previ-
ous case we are capable (with the value obtained of A0)
of recovering all the cosmological quantities but not those
corresponding to electromagnetism and the Planck “con-
stant”. And vice versa. With regards to the cosmological
“constant” in the same way as in the previous case we see
that if t ≈ 1020s and c ≈ 108.4ms−1 ⇒ Λ ≈ 10−56m−2 a
value which corresponds to that presently accepted.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.

We have resolved through Dimensional Analysis DA a
ﬂat FRW model i.e. with k = 0 whose energy-momentum
tensor is described by a perfect ﬂuid and taking into
account the conservation principle for said tensor i.e.
div(Tij) = 0 in which some constants are considered as
variable i.e. as scalar functions dependent on time. It
has been proven that the dimensional technique used re-
solves in a trivial manner the problem posed and that
the results reached correspond to those already existing
in literature. New solutions have been contributed as our
model is more general as the variation of the “constants”
, e, a, ǫ0 , µ0 and mi is contemplated.

In the two models studied it is proven that the solu-
tions obtained are coherent with reference to cosmolog-
ical parameters while for electromagnetic and quantum
quantities our model is not capable of adjusting itself to
data presently accepted for these. “At this time” we be-
lieve that the approach is erroneous, an unsettling ques-

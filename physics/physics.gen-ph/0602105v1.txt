In this paper we present deﬁnitions of diﬀerent four-dimensional (4D) geometric quantities (Cliﬀord multivectors).
New decompositions of the torque N and the angular momentum M (bivectors) into 1-vectors Ns, Nt and Ms, Mt
respectively are given. The torques Ns, Nt (the angular momentums Ms, Mt), taken together, contain the same
physical information as the bivector N (the bivector M ). The usual approaches that deal with the 3D quantities E,
B, F, L, N, etc. and their transformations are objected from the viewpoint of the invariant special relativity (ISR).
In the ISR it is considered that 4D geometric quantities are well-deﬁned both theoretically and experimentally in the
4D spacetime. This is not the case with the usual 3D quantities. It is shown that there is no apparent electrodynamic
paradox with the torque, and that the principle of relativity is naturally satisﬁed, when the 4D geometric quantities
are used instead of the 3D quantities.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is almost generally accepted that the covariant quantities, e.g., the covariant angular momentum four-tensor
M µν, the torque four-tensor N µν , the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength tensor F αβ, etc. are only auxiliary mathematical
quantities from which “physical” three-dimensional (3D) quantities, the angular momentum L, the torque N, the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B, etc., are deduced. (The vectors in the 3D space will be designated in bold-face.)
The transformations of the 3D quantities are derived from the Lorentz transformations (LT) of the corresponding
(For such approaches see, e.g., [1-4].) However a geometric approach to special relativity
covariant quantities.
(SR) is recently developed, which exclusively deals with 4D geometric quantities; it is called the invariant special
relativity (ISR). In the ISR one considers that the 4D geometric quantities are well-deﬁned both theoretically and
experimentally in the 4D spacetime, and not, as usual, the 3D quantities. This geometric approach is presented in
[5-8] (tensor formalism, with tensors as geometric quantities) and [9-13] (geometric algebra formalism). (See also [14]
in which the covariant 4-momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is expressed in terms of 4-vectors of the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds.) It is shown in the mentioned references that such geometric approach is in a complete agreement
with the principle of relativity and, what is the most important, with experiments, see [7] (tensor formalism) and
[9-13] (geometric algebra formalism).

In this paper the investigation with 4D geometric quantities will be done in the geometric algebra formalism, see,
e.g., [15, 16]. Physical quantities will be represented by 4D geometric quantities, multivectors, that are deﬁned without
reference frames, i.e., as absolute quantities (AQs) or, when some basis has been introduced, they are represented as
4D coordinate-based geometric quantities (CBGQs) comprising both components and a basis.

In Sec. II we present the expressions for diﬀerent 4D AQs and CBGQs; the Lorentz force KL (1-vector) expressed
in terms of the electromagnetic ﬁeld F (x) (bivector), Eq. (1), or in terms of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B
(1-vectors), Eq. (8), the angular momentum M (bivector) and the torque N (bivector), Eq. (11). The decomposition
of F (x) into 1-vectors E and B is given in (3). The new decomposition of the torque N into two 1-vectors, the
“space-space” torque Ns and the “time-space” torque Nt is given in (13); they together contain the same physical
information as the bivector N . The similar decomposition of the angular momentum M into two 1-vectors Ms and
Mt is presented in (17). F (x) for a charge Q moving with constant velocity uQ (1-vector) is given in (2). The new
expressions for the 1-vectors E and B for the same case are given in (6).

In Sec. III we ﬁrst discuss Jackson’s [2] paradox with the 3D torque N. The paradox consists in the fact that there
is a 3D torque N and so a time rate of change of 3D angular momentum (N = dL/dt) in one inertial frame, but no
3D angular momentum L′ and no 3D torque N′ in another relatively moving inertial frame. Then it is shown that,
contrary to the general opinion, the transformations of the components of the 3D quantities (e.g., Eq. (22) for the
components of the 3D angular momentum L) drastically diﬀer from the LT of the corresponding 4D quantities (e.g.,
Eq. (24) for the components of the 4D angular momentum Ms). Furthermore, a 4D geometric quantity, for example,
1-vector Ms, is an invariant quantity under the LT, as can be seen from Eq. (25); it is the same quantity for relatively
moving inertial observers, which can use diﬀerent systems of coordinates. On the other hand the corresponding 3D
vector L in the inertial frame S is completely diﬀerent than L′ in the relatively moving S′ frame, as seen from Eq.

(23). The same fundamental diﬀerence between the 3D quantities and their transformations and the corresponding
4D geometric quantities and their LT is discussed for some other quantities and equations with them.

In Secs. IV - IV C the 4D geometric quantities from Sec. II are used to resolve Jacson’s paradox. First, in Sec.
IV A, we considered the whole problem using the bivector N as an AQ and a CBGQ. It is shown that the paradox
with the 3D torque arises since all space-space components of N as a CBGQ in the S′ frame, N ′ij , are zero but, as
shown in (35), N 12 is diﬀerent from zero in the S frame. Since the components of the 3D torque are associated with
the space-space components of N this means that N′ = 0 but N 6= 0. From the point of view of the ISR the fact
that N′6= N means that N is not obtained by the LT from N′ and thus it is not the same 4D quantity for observers
in the S′ and S frames. On the other hand when the 4D torque N is used then it is shown that N as a CBGQ in
S (see (34)) is obtained by the LT from N as a CBGQ in S′ (see (32)); they represent the same 4D quantity in two
relatively moving inertial frames, N ((32)) = N ((34)). Hence in the approach with the 4D torque N the principle of
relativity is naturally satisﬁed and there is no paradox. In Secs. IV B and IV C we have considered the same problem
using the decomposition of N into the “space-space” torque Ns and the “time-space” torque Nt, (13). Again the
same result that there is no paradox is achieved. These solutions with 4D geometric quantities can be simply applied
to the explanation of the Trouton-Noble experiment as shown in [12] and [13].

In Sec. V the conclusions are presented.

II. DEFINITIONS OF DIFFERENT 4D ABSOLUTE QUANTITIES

In this section, as already mentioned in the Introduction, we shall examine diﬀerent AQs and CBGQs. For simplicity
and for easier understanding only the standard basis {γµ; 0, 1, 2, 3} of orthonormal 1-vectors, with timelike vector γ0
in the forward light cone, will be used for CBGQs. It is worth noting that the standard basis corresponds, in fact, to
the speciﬁc system of coordinates that we call Einstein’s system of coordinates. In Einstein’s system of coordinates
the standard, i.e., Einstein’s synchronization [17] of distant clocks and Cartesian space coordinates xi are used in
the chosen inertial frame. However diﬀerent systems of coordinates are allowed in an inertial frame and they are
all equivalent in the description of physical phenomena. For example, in [5, 6] and the second and third paper in
[7], two very diﬀerent, but physically completely equivalent, systems of coordinates, Einstein’s system of coordinates
and the system of coordinates with a nonstandard synchronization, the everyday (radio) (“r”) synchronization, are
exposed and exploited throughout the paper. In order to treat diﬀerent systems of coordinates on an equal footing
we have developed such form of the LT which is independent of the chosen system of coordinates, including diﬀerent
synchronizations, [5, 6] (tensor formalism) and [9] (Cliﬀord algebra formalism). Furthermore in [6] we have presented
the transformation matrix that connects Einstein’s system of coordinates with another system of coordinates in the
same reference frame. For the sake of brevity and of clearness of the whole exposition, we shall only work with the
standard basis {γµ}, but remembering that the approach with 4D geometric quantities holds for any choice of basis.
Now let us write diﬀerent physical quantities as 4D AQs and CBGQs. The equations with them will be manifestly
Lorentz invariant equations. The position 1-vector in the 4D spacetime is x. Then x = x(τ ) determines the history
of a particle with proper time τ and proper velocity u = dx/dτ . The Lorentz force as a 4D AQ (1-vector) is

where u is the velocity 1-vector of a charge q (it is deﬁned to be the tangent to its world line). The bivector ﬁeld
F (x) (i.e., the electromagnetic ﬁeld F (x)) for a charge Q moving with constant velocity uQ (1-vector) is

KL = (q/c)F · u,

3
F (x) = kQ(x ∧ (uQ/c))/ |x ∧ (uQ/c)|

,

where k = 1/4πε0, see [13] and references therein. (For the charge Q at rest, uQ/c = γ0.)

All AQs in Eq. (2) can be written as CBGQs in some basis. We shall write them in the standard basis {γµ}.
In the {γµ} basis x = xµγµ, uQ = uµ
Qγµ, F = (1/2)F αβγα ∧ γβ; the basis components F αβ are determined as
F αβ = γβ · (γα · F ) = (γβ ∧ γα) · F . Every 4D CBGQ is invariant under the passive Lorentz transformations (LT);
the components transform by the LT and the basis by the inverse LT leaving the whole CBGQ unchanged. (This
is the reason for the name ISR.) The invariance of some 4D CBGQ under the passive LT reﬂects the fact that such
mathematical, invariant, 4D geometric quantity represents the same physical quantity for relatively moving inertial
observers. Due to the invariance of any 4D CBGQ under the passive LT it will hold that, e.g., F = (1/2)F µνγµ ∧ γν =
(1/2)F ′µνγ′
µ are the basis 1-vectors in two relatively moving
inertial frames S and S′ respectively.
(Of course one could also use another basis, e.g., the basis {rµ} with “r”
r rµ ∧ rν = (1/2)F ′µν
synchronization, in which F will be represented as F = (1/2)F µν
ν, where the primed
quantities are the Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones.) The use of CBGQs enables us to have clearly and
correctly deﬁned concept of sameness of a physical system for diﬀerent observers. In the ISR only quantities that do

not change upon the passive LT have an independent physical reality, both theoretically and experimentally. When
the physical laws are written with such Lorentz invariant quantities as in ISR then the principle of relativity is
automatically satisﬁed and there is no need to postulate it as in Einstein’s SR. It is worth noting that Einstein’s [17]
formulation of SR deals with Lorentz contraction, dilatation of time and the usual transformations of the 3D vectors
E and B (see, e.g., Eqs. (11.148) and (11.149) in [1]). However, e.g., the rest length and the Lorentz contracted
length are not the same 4D quantity for relatively moving observers, since the transformed length L0(1 − β2)1/2 is
diﬀerent than the rest length L0. Rohrlich [18] named the Lorentz contraction and other transformations which do
not refer to the same 4D quantity as the “apparent” transformations (AT). Similar ideas are expressed by Gamba [19].
Both Rohrlich [18] and Gamba [19] considered that the same quantity for relatively moving frames is a covariantly
deﬁned quantity (components of tensors) that retain the same form under the LT. But any covariant quantity, e.g.,
the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength tensor F αβ, consists of components (numbers) that are taken (implicitly) in some
basis. It is true that these components refer to the same tensor quantity, but they cannot be equal since the bases are
not included, e.g., F µν 6= F ′µν, where F ′µν are Lorentz transformed components. When the 4D geometric quantities
are used, as in the ISR, the concept of sameness becomes very clear since, as mentioned above, every 4D CBGQ is
invariant under the passive LT. Using 4D geometric quantities and the concept of sameness we have shown in [6]
and [7] that not only the Lorentz contraction but the dilatation of time as well are the AT. Recently a fundamental
result is achieved in [8, 10] and [11] (both in the tensor formalism and in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism). There it
is proved that the usual transformations of the 3D E and B are also the AT; they markedly diﬀer from the LT of
the 4D geometric quantities that represent the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. This result indicates that, contrary to
the general belief, which prevails from Einstein’s fundamental paper [17], the usual transformations of E and B are
not relativistically correct. Comparison with experiments in [7] and [10-12] clearly showed that the approach to SR
with 4D geometric quantities, i.e., the ISR, is in a true agreement with all considered experiments. That agreement
is independent of the chosen frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it.

Now let us see how the bivector ﬁeld F can be decomposed. Usually the spacetime split is used for the decomposition
of F into the electric and magnetic ﬁelds that are represented by bivectors, see Eqs. (58)-(60) in Hestenes’ paper [15].
This means that Hestenes’ decomposition is an observer dependent decomposition; an observer independent quantity
F is decomposed into observer dependent bivectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

Instead of using the observer dependent decomposition from [15,16] we shall make an analogy with the tensor
formalism [20] (see also [5, 6] and [8]) and represent the electric and magnetic ﬁelds by 1-vectors E and B [9] that
are deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., as AQs

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v,

E = (1/c)F · v, B = −(1/c

)I(F ∧ v),

2

where I is the unit pseudoscalar. (I is deﬁned algebraically without introducing any reference frame, as in [21], Sec.
1.2.) The velocity v and all other quantities entering into the relations (3) are AQs. That velocity v characterizes
some general observer. We can say, as in tensor formalism [20,6,8] that v is the velocity (1-vector) of a family of
observers who measures E and B ﬁelds. Of course the relations for E and B, Eq. (3), hold for any observer; they are
manifestly Lorentz invariant equations. Note that

E · v = B · v = 0,

which yields that only three components of E and three components of B are independent quantities. The relations
(3) (and (4)) that connect F and 1-vectors E and B are explained in more detail in [9-11]. We also remark that a
complete and consistent formulation of classical electromagnetism with the bivector ﬁeld F as the primary quantity
is presented in [12].

(It is shown in [10,11] that one can use another equivalent decomposition of F into bivectors EHv and BHv

F = EHv + cIBHv, EHv = (1/c2)(F · v) ∧ v,

BHv = −(1/c3)I[(F ∧ v) · v],

IBHv = (1/c3)(F ∧ v) · v.

However we shall use the decomposition (3) into 1-vectors E and B since it is much simpler and closer to the usual
formulation with the 3D E and B.)

The 1-vectors E and B for a charge Q moving with constant velocity uQ can be determined from (3) and the

expression for the bivector ﬁeld F (2). They are

E = (D/c2)[(x ∧ uQ) · v]
B = (−D/c3)I(x ∧ uQ ∧ v),

3

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

3
where D = kQ/ |x ∧ (uQ/c)|

. Note that B in (6) can be expressed in terms of E as

B = (1/c3)I(uQ ∧ E ∧ v).

When the world lines of the observer and the charge Q coincide, uQ = v, then (6) yields that B = 0 and only an
electric ﬁeld (Coulomb ﬁeld) remains.

The Lorentz force can be written in terms of 4D AQs, 1-vectors E and B, as [9,10]

KL = (q/c) [(1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v] · u.

Particularly from the deﬁnition of the Lorentz force KL and the relation E = (1/c)F · v (from (3)) it follows that
the Lorentz force ascribed by an observer comoving with a charge, u = v, is purely electric KL = qE. When KL is
written as a CBGQ in S and in the {γµ} basis it is given as

KL = (q/c2)[(vν uν)Eµ + eεµ

νρuνcBρ − (Eνuν)vµ]γµ,

where eεµνρ ≡ ελµνρvλ is the totally skew-symmetric Levi-Civita pseudotensor induced on the hypersurface orthogonal
to v.

When the force, e.g., the Lorentz force KL (8), is known we can solve the equation of motion, Newton’s second law,

written as

where p is the proper momentum (1-vector); p as a CBGQ in S and in the {γµ} basis is p = pνγν, pν =
u)−1/2, βu = |u| /c.
(γumc, γupx, γupy, γupz), where px,y,z are the components of the 3D momentum p =mu, γu = (1−β2
Furthermore the angular momentum M (bivector), the torque N (bivector) for the force K and manifestly Lorentz

invariant equation connecting M and N are deﬁned as

K = dp/dτ, p = mu,

M = x ∧ p, N = x ∧ K;
N = dM/dτ.

When M and N are written as CBGQs in the {γµ} basis they become

M = (1/2)M µνγµ ∧ γν, M µν = m(xµuν − xν uµ),
N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν , N µν = xµK ν − xν K µ.

We see that the components M µν from (12) are identical to the covariant angular momentum four-tensor given by
Eq. (A3) in Jackson’s paper [2]. However M and N from (11) are 4D geometric quantities, the 4D AQs, which are
independent of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it, whereas the components M µν
and N µν that are used in the usual covariant approach, e.g., Eq. (A3) in [2], are coordinate quantities, the numbers
obtained in the speciﬁc system of coordinates, i.e., in the {γµ} basis. Notice that, in contrast to the usual covariant
approach, M and N from (12) are also 4D geometric quantities, the 4D CBGQs, which contain both components and
a basis, here bivector basis γµ ∧ γν.

In the same way as F is decomposed in (3) into 1-vectors E and B and the unit time-like 1-vector v/c we can
decompose the bivector N deﬁned either as 4D AQs (by the relation (11)) or as 4D CBGQ (by equation (12) into two
1-vectors Ns and Nt

with the condition

N = (v/c) ∧ Nt + (v/c) · (NsI),
Nt = (v/c) · N, Ns = I(N ∧ v/c),

Ns · v = Nt · v = 0;

only three components of Ns and three components of Nt are independent since N is antisymmetric. Here, as in
(3), v is the velocity (1-vector) of a family of observers who measures N . All quantities in (13) are 4D AQs. It is
worth noting that the introduction of Ns and Nt and the decomposition of the bivector N into 1-vectors Ns and Nt,
equations (13) and (14), are not earlier mentioned in the literature, as I am aware. When Ns and Nt are written as
CBGQs in the {γµ} basis they become

Ns = (1/2c)εαβµνNαβvµγν, Nt = (1/c)N µνvµγν.

It is seen from (15) that in the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, in which the observers who measure Ns and Nt are at

rest, and in the {γµ} basis, vµ = (c, 0, 0, 0), N 0

s = N 0

Thus in our approach the torque in the 4D spacetime is the bivector N deﬁned either as 4D AQs (by the relation
(11)) or as 4D CBGQ (by equation (12). From the bivector N we have constructed two 1-vectors, the “space-space”
torque Ns and the “time-space” torque Nt (the relation (13) with the condition (14)), which together contain the same
physical information as the bivector N . Hence both Ns and Nt are 4D torques which taken together are equivalent
to the 4D torque, the bivector N .

The whole discussion with the torque can be completely repeated for the angular momentum replacing N , Ns and

Nt by M , Ms and Mt. Thus we have

whith the condition

M = (v/c) ∧ Mt + (v/c) · (MsI),
Mt = (v/c) · M, Ms = I(M ∧ v/c),

Ms · v = Mt · v = 0.

1-vectors Ms and Mt correspond to L and K from [2] respectively in the usual 3D picture. It has to be remarked
that, according to my knowledge, the relations (17) and (18) were not earlier mentioned in the literature. It is usually
considered that only Ms is angular momentum, see, e.g., Ludvigsen’s book, [20] Sec. 8.3 (with tensors as geometric
quantities). In our approach both Ms and Mt are angular momentums, which have to be treated on an equal footing.
They contain the same physical information as the bivector M only when they are taken together.

When Ms and Mt are written as CBGQs in the {γµ} basis.they become

Ms = (1/2c)εαβµνMαβvµγν, Mt = (1/c)M µνvµγν .

The representation of the angular momentum with two 1-vectors Ms and Mt will surely have important consequences

in the quantum theory and in the quantum ﬁeld theory.

Instead of using decompositions of N and M into 1-vectors Ns, Nt and Ms, Mt we could decompose them into
bivectors in a complete analogy with the decomposition of F into the bivectors EHv and BHv (5), but it will not be
done here.

III. JACKSON’S PARADOX. THE 3D QUANTITIES AND
THEIR APPARENT TRANSFORMATIONS

Having discussed diﬀerent 4D geometric quantities we now examine the corresponding 3D quantities and their
transformations. A nice example from the recent literature will help to better understand the essential diﬀerence
between the approach with 4D geometric quantities and the usual approach with 3D quantities.

In a recent paper Jackson [2] discussed the apparent paradox of diﬀerent mechanical equations for force and torque
governing the motion of a charged particle in diﬀerent inertial frames. Two inertial frames S (the laboratory frame)
and S′ (the moving frame) are considered (they are K and K ′ respectively in Jackson’s notation). In S′ a particle of
charge q and mass m experiences only the radially directed electric force caused by a point charge Q ﬁxed permanently
at the origin. Consequently both the angular momentum L′ and the torque N′ are zero in S′, see Fig. 1(a) in [2]. In
S the charge Q is in uniform motion and it produces both an electric ﬁeld E and a magnetic ﬁeld B. The existence
of B in S is responsible for the existence of the 3D magnetic force F = qu × B and this force provides a 3D torque
N (N = x × F) on the charged particle, see Fig. 1(b) in [2]. Consequently a nonvanishing 3D angular momentum of
the charged particle changes in time in S, N = dL/dt. Thus there is a 3D torque and so a time rate of change of 3D
angular momentum in one inertial frame, but no 3D angular momentum and no 3D torque in another. Jackson [2]
considers that there is no paradox and that such result is relativistically correct result. (It has to be mentioned that
exactly the same paradox appears in the Trouton-Noble experiment, see, e.g., [4] and references therein.)

In Sec. III in [2] Jackson discusses “Lorentz transformations of the angular momentum between frames.” He starts
with the usual covariant deﬁnition of the angular momentum tensor M µν = xµpν − xν pµ, Eq. (8) in [2]. Notice that
the standard basis {γµ}, i.e., Einstein’s system of coordinates, is implicit in that deﬁnition, actually, the implicit basis

6

(20)

(21)

is bivector basis as in (12). Then the components Li of the 3D vector L (which is called the angular momentum) are
identiﬁed with the space-space components of M µν and the components Lt,i of the 3D vector Lt (for which a physical
interpretation is not given) are identiﬁed with the three time-space components of M µν (we denote Jackson’s Ki with
Lt,i, K with Lt). (Note that instead of the 3D L and Lt we are dealing with 4D geometric quantities, 1-vectors Ms
and Mt, deﬁned by (17) and (18).)

This is in a complete analogy with the way in which (see [1] Sec. 11.9) the components of 3D vectors B and E are

identiﬁed with the space-space and the time-space components respectively of F µν

(It is worth noting that Einstein’s fundamental work [22] is the earliest reference on covariant electrodynamics and
on the identiﬁcation of components of F αβ with the components of the 3D E and B.)

The mentioned identiﬁcation for Li and Lt,i is

Bi = (1/2c)εiklF lk, Ei = F i0.

Li = (1/2)εiklM kl, Lt,i = M 0i.

The relations (20) and (21) show that the components Li correspond to −Bi and Lt,i to −Ei. In (20) and (21) the
components of the 3D vectors B, E and L, Lt respectively are written with lowered (generic) subscripts, since they
are not the spatial components of the 4D quantities. This refers to the third-rank antisymmetric ε tensor too. The
super- and subscripts are used only on the components of the 4D quantities. The 3D vectors L and Lt, as geometric
quantities in the 3D space, are constructed multiplying the components M µν of a 4D geometric quantity M , (21), by
the unit 3D vectors i, j, k, e.g., L =M 23i + M 31j + M 12k. Such procedure clearly shows that in the approach from [2]
the physical reality is attributed to the 3D vector L (but what is with a physical interpretation for Lt) and not to the
whole set of components M µν, i.e., the 4D geometric quantity M . Note that exactly the same procedure is applied
to construct geometric quantities in the 3D space B and E from the components F µν and the unit 3D vectors i, j, k.
The objections to such procedure for the construction of B and E are considered in detail in, e.g., [8, 10] and [11],
and they apply in the same measure to the construction of L and Lt. Some of them are the following.

(i) The whole procedure is made in an inertial frame of reference with the Einstein system of coordinates, i.e., the
standard basis {γµ}. In another system of coordinates that is diﬀerent than the Einstein system of coordinates, e.g.,
diﬀering in the chosen synchronization (as it is the ’r’ synchronization considered in [5-7]), the identiﬁcation of Ei
with F i0, as in (20) (and also for Bi), or Lt,i with M 0i in (21), is impossible and meaningless.

(ii) Furthermore the components Ei, Biand Lt,i, Li, of the 3D vectors E, B and Lt, L respectively are determined
from 4D quantities written in the standard basis {γµ} . Hence when forming the geometric quantities the components
would need to be multiplied with the unit 1-vectors γi and not with the unit 3D-vectors.

It is considered in [2] that the relations (21) hold both in S′, the rest frame of the charges q and Q, and in S, the
laboratory frame, which then leads to the usual transformations of the components of the 3D vector L that are given
by Eq. 11 in [2]. We write them as

Note that the components Li in S are expressed by the mixture of components L′
t,i from S′. It is clear from
the usual transformations (22) that the components of the 3D angular momentum do not vanish in the laboratory
frame S, even if they do in S′. In this case L3 is diﬀerent from zero due to contribution from L′
t,2. Then Jackson [2]
calculates dL3/dt, where L3 is obtained “via a Lorentz transformation,” i.e., via the transformations (22) (note that
in [2] the derivative of L3 is relative to the coordinate time t and not, as in (11), relative to the proper time τ ). It
is shown in [2] that dL3/dt is = N3, where the torque N3 (Nz in Eq. (7) in [2]) is “directly obtained from the force
equation in the laboratory.” Nz in Eq. (7) in [2] is obtained using the force equation (Eq. (4) in [2]) with the 3D
vectors p, F, E and B, but again the derivative is relative to the coordinate time t. Jackson [2] ﬁnds the consistency
in both calculations and states: “The time rate of change of the particle’s angular momentum obtained via a Lorentz
transformation is equal to the torque directly obtained from the force equation in the laboratory, as it must.” In our
opinion what is found in [2] is that when using the 3D vectors and their transformations (like Eq. (22)) the paradox
is always obtained and, actually, the principle of relativity is violated.

Let us examine in more detail the transformations of components of the 3D quantities and also of the 3D vectors.
As already said both L′ and L, as geometric quantities in the 3D space, are constructed multiplying the components
L′
i and Li (given by (22)) by the unit 3D vectors i′, j′, k′ and i, j, k respectively. This gives another objection to the
usual construction of L′ and L.

(iii) The components Li are determined by the transformations (22), but there is no transformation which transforms
the unit 3D vectors i′, j′, k′ into the unit 3D vectors i, j, k. Hence it is not true that the 3D vector L =L1i + L2j + L3k

Thus contrary to the general opinion, the transformations (22) are not the LT but the AT of the 3D L. The same
situation happens with the transformations of the 3D B and E as explained in detail in [8, 10] and [11].

On the other hand, as already mentioned in Sec. II, every 4D CBGQ is invariant under the passive LT, which
means that such 4D geometric quantity represents the same physical quantity for relatively moving inertial observers.
Hence, it holds, e.g., Mt = (1/c)M µνvµγν = (1/c)M ′µνv′
µγ′
ν, where all primed quantities are obtained by the LT from
the unprimed ones. Ms and Mt, written as 4D CBGQs, transform under the LT as every 1-vector (as 4D CBGQ)
′µ
transforms, which means that the components M µ
t ; there
is no mixing of components. Thus the equation corresponding to Eq. (11) in [2], i.e., to Eq. (22), will be

and the same for M µ

k and L′
by the mixture of components L′
t,k. Furthermore Ms and Mt are geometric quantities in the 4D spacetime
s and M µ
since the components M µ
t are multiplied by the unit 1-vectors γµ, while, as we mentioned, the 3D angular
momentum L is formed multiplying the components M µν (i.e., Li determined by (21)) of a 4D geometric quantity
M , by the unit 3D vectors i, j, k. Of course, it holds that Ms is the same quantity for observers in S and S′, which
can use diﬀerent basis, e.g., {γµ}, {rµ} and so on. Thus

where the primed quantities are the Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones; see the discussion at the beginning of
Sec. II.

This is in a complete analogy with the fundamental diﬀerence between the AT of the 3D E and B and the LT of
1-vectors E and B that are deﬁned by (3); see, e.g., [10, 11], in which this fundamental diﬀerence is exactly proved.
There, it is also shown that the LT of 1-vectors E and B are in a complete agreement with experiments on motional
emf and Faraday disk, while it is not the case with the AT of the 3D E and B. (Regarding the mentioned analogy,
e.g., the AT for the components of the 3D B are the same as the AT for Li that are given by (22); Li, L′
i have to

The above consideration suggests that the transformations of other 3D quantities are the AT as well. For example,
the AT of the 3D torque N, which are the same as (22), are found, e.g., in Jeﬁmenko’s book [3] and given in [4] Eqs.
(1)-(3). In Sec. 8 of [3], under the title: “From relativistic electromagnetism to relativistic mechanics,” the AT of
diﬀerent 3D quantities are presented. Notice that the AT of the 3D E, B, L and N may all be obtained in the same
way by the identiﬁcation of the components of the 3D vectors with the components of second-rank 4D tensors, i.e.,
bivectors in the 4D spacetime.

Furthermore the transformations of the 3D force F are also the AT; they are given, e.g., by Eqs. (8-5.4)-(8-5.6) in

[3] (or by Eqs. (1.53)-(1.55) in [23])

x = [Fx − (βu/c)(Fu)]/(1 − (βuux/c)), F

(26)

where u is the 3D velocity of a particle. All previously mentioned objections, (i) - (iii), regarding the construction
of the 3D vectors, are also at place here. The 3D forces F, F′ are constructed from the components Fx,y,z, F ′
x,y,z
(determined by (26)) and the unit 3D vectors i, j, k, and i′, j′, k′ respectively and i′, j′, k′ are not obtained by any
transformations from i, j, k. Particularly it is visible from (26) that F′ 6= F; they do not refer to the same quantity
in the 4D spacetime and the transformations (26) are not the LT but the AT. The same holds for the well-known
transformations of the 3D velocity u that are given, e.g., by equations (11.31) in [1], or by equations (7-2.5)-(7-2.7)
in [3].

From the ISR viewpoint, the correctly deﬁned quantities in the 4D spacetime, both theoretically and experimentally,
are 1-vectors K = K νγν and u = uνγν, or in another basis {rν} these 1-vectors are K = K ν
r rν . In
contrast to awkward transformations of the components of the 3D force F (26) the LT of the components K ν of the
1-vector K are very simple (the LT (24) but with K µ, K ′µ replacing M µ
s ). When the components of the 4-force
K and of the 4-velocity u are determined in the standard basis {γν} then they can be expressed in terms of components
of the 3D force F, (Fx, Fy, Fz), and of the 3D velocity u, (ux, uy, uz). They are K ν = (γuFu/c, γuFx, γuFy, γuFz) and
2
/c2)−1/2. We see that, in general, the spatial components K i, ui
uν = (γuc, γuux, γuuy, γuuz), where γu = (1 − |u|

r rν and u = uν

s , M ′µ

diﬀer from the components of the 3D quantities F, u. Only in the case when the considered particle is at rest, i.e.,
ux,y,z = 0, γu = 1 and consequently uν = (c, 0, 0, 0), then K ν will be exclusively determined with the components
Fx,y,z, i.e., K ν = (0, Fx, Fy, Fz). However even in that case uν and K ν are the components of the 4D geometric
quantities u = uνγν and K = K νγν in the {γν} basis and not the components of some 3D geometric quantities u
and F, see also the discussion in [10] Sec. 3.2. This discussion additionaly shows that the transformations (26) have
nothing in common with the LT of the 1-vector K.

It is generally accepted, e.g., [1, 3, 23], that the “relativistic” equations of motion have the same form in two

relatively moving inertial frames S and S′

F = dp/dt, p =mγuu

see, for example, Eqs. (1.39) and (1.40) in [23], or Sec. 12.2 and 12.4 (with the Lorentz force) in [1].

In Einstein’s formulation [17] of SR the principle of relativity is a fundamental postulate that is supposed to hold
for all physical laws including those expressed by 3D quantities, e.g., the Maxwell equations with the 3D E and B;
Einstein [17] used that postulate to derive the transformations of the 3D E and B. It is proved in [11], both in the
geometric algebra and tensor formalisms, that the usual Maxwell equations with the 3D E and B change their form
under the LT and thus that they are not covariant under the LT. This result explicitly shows that the principle of
relativity does not hold for physical laws expressed by 3D quantities (a fundamental achievement). The results from
this section also reveal that a 3D quantity cannot correctly transform under the LT, which means that it does not
have an independent physical reality in the 4D spacetime; it is not the same quantity for relatively moving observers
in the 4D spacetime. Hence it is not true that Eqs. (27) are the relativistic equations of motion since the primed 3D
quantities are not obtained by the LT from the unprimed ones, but they are obtained in terms of the AT for the 3D
force F (26) and the 3D momentum p, i.e., the 3D velocity u, Eq. (11.31) in [1]. Instead of Eqs. (27) one has to use
equation of motion with 4D geometric quantities (10).

Similarly it is generally accepted in usual approaches that the Lorentz force law remains of the same form in

relatively moving inertial frames S and S′

where all primed quantities are considered to be obtained by the LT from the unprimed ones. For example, it is
argued, e.g., in [3] Sec. 8: “This law does not depend on the inertial reference frame in which q, u, E, and B are
measured.” The same assertions about the form of the Lorentz force law in two inertial frames can be found in [23],
Eqs. (6.42) and (6.43). There, this form invariance of the Lorentz force, together with the AT of the 3D force F (26)
and the AT of the 3D velocity u, Eqs. (1.26)-(1.28) in [23], are used to derive the AT for the 3D E and B. However
the above discussion clearly shows that the 3D quantities in S′ are not obtained by the LT from the corresponding
3D quantities in S than by the use of the AT. Therefore the Lorentz force law has to be written by means of 4D
geometric quantities, e.g., Eq. (1) with bivector ﬁeld F , or Eq. (8) with 1-vectors E and B and, of course, so deﬁned
KL is an invariant quantity under the LT.

IV. THE RESOLUTION OF JACKSON’S PARADOX USING 4D TORQUES

Instead of dealing with 3D quantities E, B, L and N and their AT as in [2] we shall examine Jackson’s paradox
using the expressions for the 4D geometric quantities from Sec. II. First we write N from (11) using the expression
(1) for KL and (2) for F . Then N becomes

3
where D is already deﬁned in (6), D = kQ/ |x ∧ (uQ/c)|
torque N written as an AQ. Then Ns and Nt are determined from (13) and (29) as

. This is the most general expression for the considered

Comparison with (6) shows that Ns and Nt can be expressed in terms of B and E as

N = (Dq/c2)(u · x)(uQ ∧ x),

Ns = (Dq/c3)(u · x)I(x ∧ v ∧ uQ),
Nt = (Dq/c3)(u · x)[(x ∧ uQ) · v].

Ns = q(u · x)B,
Nt = (q/c)(u · x)E.

As already said, in connection with (6), when uQ = v then B = 0. The relations (30) and (31) reveal that in that
case Ns = 0 as well.

A. N as a CBGQ in S′ and S frames

Let us now write all AQs from (29) as CBGQs in S′, the rest frame of the charge Q, in which uQ = cγ′

The components x′µ are x′µ = (x′0 = ct′, x′1, x′2, 0) where x′1 = r′ cos θ′, x′2 = r′ sin θ′. In S′ the velocity 1-vector

It can be easily seen that all N ′αβ are zero in the S′ frame when it is supposed that at t′ = 0 the charge q is still
at rest, i.e., u′µ = (c, 0, 0, 0). From the invariance of any 4D CBGQ under the passive LT it follows that at t′ = 0 the
whole N is zero not only in S′ but in the laboratory frame S as well. This case explicitly refers to the Trouton-Noble
paradox as discussed in [12, 13].

L − x′ν K

′

Similarly in order to ﬁnd the torque N in the S frame we write all AQs from (29) as CBGQs in S and in the {γµ}

basis. In S the charge Q is moving with velocity uQ = γQcγ0 + γQβQcγ1, where βQ = |uQ| /c and γQ = (1 − β2
Another way to ﬁnd N in S is to make the LT of N in S′ ((32)). The result is

N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν = N 01γ0 ∧ γ1 + N 02γ0 ∧ γ2 + N 12γ1 ∧ γ2,

where N 01 = N ′01, N 02 = γQN ′02 and N 12 = γQβQN ′02. When N is written explicitly in terms of quantities in S it
becomes

N = (Dq/c)(uµxµ)[γQ(x1 − βQx0)(γ0 ∧ γ1)
+ γQx2(γ0 ∧ γ2) + βQγQx2(γ1 ∧ γ2)].

We see that in the laboratory frame, where the charge Q is moving, the components N µν that are diﬀerent from zero
are not only N 01 and N 02 but also N 12 = βQN 02.

Of course, we could start with the 4D angular momentum M = x ∧ p and calculate it in both frames S′ and S.

Then using the relation N = dM/dτ one can again ﬁnd the same expressions (32) and (34) for N .

The component N 12 can be written in the form similar to the expression for Nz, Eq. (7) in [2]. Thus

L = βQctK 2

N 12 = βQctK 2

K 2
N 12 from (35) we see that instead of the components of the 3D Lorentz force F, we have the components K 2
of the 4D Lorentz force KL, which is deﬁned by (1).

L − βQyK 0
L = (q/c)(F 20u0 + F 21u1). Comparing Nz from Eq. (7) in [2] and our
L and K 0

L can be determined from (1) and it is K 2

L − (q/c)βQy(F 0iui).

This form for N 12 clearly shows the essential diﬀerence between our approach and the usual approach, e.g., [2].
The paradox with the 3D torque arises since all N ′ij are zero but, according to (35), N 12 is diﬀerent from zero in the
S frame, which means that N′ = 0 but N 6= 0. From the point of view of the ISR the fact that N′6= N means that
N is not obtained by the LT from N′ and thus it is not the same 4D quantity for observers in the S′ and S frames.
In contrast to the usual approach [2] with 3D quantities, N determined by (34) is obtained by the LT from N given
by (32); they represent the same 4D quantity in two relatively moving inertial frames, N ((32)) = N ((34)). Hence
the principle of relativity is naturally satisﬁed in our geometric approach and there is not any paradox.

(35)

L

This consideration indicates that in order to check the validity of the above relations with 4D quantities, and thus
the validity of the principle of relativity and, more generally, of the SR, the measurements must be changed relative
to the usual measurements of the 3D quantities. For the 4D quantities the experimentalists have to measure all
components of N and M in both frames S′ and S. The observers in S′ and S are able to compare only such complete
set of data which corresponds to the same 4D geometric quantity. Such point of view is illustrated in much more
detail in [7].

B. Ns and Nt as CBGQs in S′ and S frames. S′ is
the frame of “ﬁducial” observers

10

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

Let us now make the same consideration as in Sec. IV A, but with Ns and Nt as CBGQs. From the relations (13)
and (14) we see that 1-vectors Ns and Nt are not uniquely determined by N , but their explicit values depend also on
v. This means that it is important to know which frame is chosen to be the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, in which
the observers who measure Ns and Nt are at rest. As seen from (3), (4) and (17), (18) the same conclusions refer also
to the determination of E, B and Ms, Mt from F and M respectively.

First, it will be assumed that S′, the rest frame of the charge Q is the γ0-system, i.e., the frame of “ﬁducial”
0 = v, and the velocity 1-vector of the charge q at any t′ is u = u′µγ′
observers. Hence, in S′ ({γ′

where u′µ = (u′0, u′1, u′2, 0). The results for 1-vectors Ns and Nt can be simply obtained using (30) which yields that
the “space-space” torque Ns as a CBGQ in S′ is

where D = kQ/r′3 and N ′01, N ′02 are given by (32).

The same results for Ns and Nt in S′ can be obtained using Eqs. (31) and (6), but written in terms of CBGQs. In

that case B and E from (6) are

2).

Note that the spatial components of E are the same as the components of the 3D E′ as it must.

At t′ = 0 and when u′µ = (c, 0, 0, 0) all N ′αβ are zero and consequently both Ns and Nt are zero not only in S′ but

in the laboratory frame S as well.

Let us now determine 1-vectors Ns and Nt as CBGQs in S ({γµ} basis). Relative to the S frame both the charge
Q and the “ﬁducial” observers are moving with velocity uQ = v = γQcγ0 + γQβQcγ1. Then Ns and Nt in S can be
obtained either directly from (30), or by means of the LT of the 1-vectors Ns (36) and Nt (37). Due to invariance of
any 4D CBGQ under the passive LT the “space-space” torque Ns is zero in the laboratory frame S too

The “time-space” torque Nt as a CBGQ in S is

Nt = γQβQN 01γ0 + γQN 01γ1 + (1/γQ)N 02γ2,

Ns = N µ

s γµ = 0.

where N 01 and N 02 are determined by (34).

The same Ns and Nt in S can be found using (31) and (6) and writing all AQs as CBGQs in the S frame. E and
B in S are determined as the LT of the 1-vectors E and B given by (38) (for the LT of E and B see [10]). This yields

B = Bµγµ = 0, E = Eµγµ,
E0 = DβQγ2

Q(x1 − βQx0), E1 = E0/βQ, E2 = Dx2, E3 = 0.

Hence Ns = N µ

s γµ = 0 and the same Nt in S is obtained as in (40).

Again, we could start with the 4D angular momentums Ms and Mt deﬁned by (17) and (18) and calculate them in
both frames S′ and S. Then using the relations Ns,t = dMs,t/dτ one can again ﬁnd the same expressions (36), (37)
and (39), (40) for Ns, Nt in S′ and S respectively.

It can be easily checked that Nt given by (37) in S′ is the same 4D CBGQ as Nt given by (40) in S, i.e., that
N ′1

t γ2, and it is seen from (36) and (39) that Ns is the same 4D CBGQ for observers
in S′ and S. This again shows that the principle of relativity is naturally satisﬁed in our ISR and that there is not
any paradox.

t γ1 + N 2

t γ0 + N 1

1 + N ′2

2 = N 0

t γ′

Inserting Ns and Nt from (36), (37) and (39), (40) into the relation (13) (written with CBGQs), we can directly

check the validity of these relations.

According to our result (39) the 1-vector Ns is zero both in S′ and S at any t′ when the “ﬁducial” frame is the S′
frame. However Nt is diﬀerent from zero in both frames. As already said only Ns and Nt taken together are equivalent
to the bivector N , which means that validity of the above relations can be checked measuring all six independent
components of Ns and Nt in both frames. It has to be remarked that the usual 3D N is connected with the three
spatial components of Ns.

Note that the usual 3D rotation requires measurement of only three independent variables. Therefore in order to
test SR, e.g., by means of the Trouton-Noble type experiments, it is not enough, as usually done, to measure three

11

independent parameters of the 3D rotation (i.e., three independent components of Ns, or Ms), but also one has to
measure the other three relevant variables (i.e., three independent components of Nt, or Mt).

C. Ns and Nt as CBGQs in S′ and S frames. S is
the frame of “ﬁducial” observers

Let us now assume that the laboratory frame S is the γ0-system, i.e., the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, in which
the observers who measure Ns and Nt are at rest, that is, v = vµγµ = cγ0, vµ = (c, 0, 0, 0). Then from (15), i.e., (16),
it follows that in S the temporal components of the 1-vectors Ns and Nt are zero and only their spatial components
remain. In the laboratory frame S the charge Q is moving and the components of the CBGQ uµ
Qγµ are given as
uµ
Q = (γQc, γQβQc, 0, 0).
The 1-vectors Ns and Nt will be determined either directly from (30) and the above expressions for v and uQ, or
by the use of the already known expression (34) for the bivector N in S and the relation (15), i.e., (16). This yields
that

12

Ns = N µ

(42)
where N 12 is from (34) or (35) and N 01, N 02 are from (34). It is visible from (42) that in the case when S is the
frame of “ﬁducial” observers the “space-space” torque Ns is diﬀerent from zero.

γ3, Nt = N

s γµ = N

γ1 + N

γ2,

In the same way as in Sec. IV B we ﬁnd Ns and Nt using (31) and (6). Now the charge Q moves in the frame of

“ﬁducial” observers, the S frame, which yields that both E and the magnetic ﬁeld B are diﬀerent from zero. Then
E = Eµγµ, E0 = E3 = 0, E1 = DγQ(x1 − βQx0), E2 = DγQx2,

(43)

02

and the magnetic ﬁeld is

B = Bµγµ, B0 = B1 = B2 = 0, B3 = (D/c)γQβQx2 = βQE2/c.
The spatial components Ei and Bi from (43) and (44) are the same as the usual expressions for the components of
the 3D vectors E and B for an uniformly moving charge. Inserting (43) and (44) into (31) we again ﬁnd Ns and Nt
as in (42). Ns is diﬀerent from zero since B given by (44) is diﬀerent from zero.

(44)

Instead of expressing components of KL in (35) in terms of components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld F we shall now
write Ns from (42) in terms of 1-vectors E and B, which are explicitly given by Eqs. (43) and (44). Then Ns becomes

Ns = N 3γ3 = N 12γ3 = (βQctK 2

L + (q/c)βQy(Eµuµ)γ3.

(45)
Remember that E0 = B0 = 0, Eqs. (43) and (44), when S is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers. In the usual approach,
e.g., [2], it is considered that in the S frame the whole physical torque is the 3D N, i.e., Nz, given by Eq. (7) in [2].
We see that in the 4D spacetime the physical torque is the bivector N that is given by relation (34) as a CBGQ in
S and in the {γµ} basis. When that S is chosen to be the frame of “ﬁducial” observers then N can be represented
by two 1-vectors Ns and Nt given by (42) and (45), which are both physical and have to be determined theoretically
and experimentally. Only when the laboratory frame S is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers the spatial components
of Ns have some resemblance with the components of the 3D N. However note that in (45) all components are the
components of the 4D quantities, 1-vectors x, u, KL, E and B, while in Eq. (7) in [2] only the corresponding 3D
vectors are involved.

Let us now determine 1-vectors Ns and Nt as CBGQs in S′. Relative to the S′ frame the charge Q is at rest
uQ = cγ′
1. Then Ns and Nt in S′ can be
obtained either directly from (30) or by means of the LT of 1-vectors Ns and Nt as CBGQs, which are given by (42).
We ﬁnd that Ns is diﬀerent from zero not only in S but in the S′ frame as well

0, but the “ﬁducial” observers are moving with velocity v = γQcγ′

The same results for Ns and Nt in S′ can be obtained using (31) and (6) and writing all AQs as CBGQs in the S′
frame. E and B in S′ are determined by the LT of 1-vectors E and B given by (43) and (44) respectively. They are

Inserting (48) into (31) the same Ns and Nt are found as in (46) and (47). Ns in S′ is diﬀerent from zero since B
given by (48) is diﬀerent from zero.

Of course it can be again easily seen that Ns (Nt) from (42) is equal to Ns (Nt) from (46) ((47)); it is the same 4D

CBGQ for observers in S and S′.

Inserting Ns and Nt from (42) and also from (46) and (47) into the relation (13), which connects N with Ns and
Nt, we ﬁnd the same expressions (34) and (32) for N in S and S′, and we already know that they are equal, N ((32))
= N ((34)).

The above discussion shows that the explicit expressions for Ns and Nt depend on the choice for the frame of
“ﬁducial” observers. For example, in the S frame Ns and Nt are given by the relations (39) and (40), or (42), when
S′, or S, are chosen for the frame of “ﬁducial” observers. However when they are inserted into (13) they will always
give the same N .

The paradox does not appear in the considered representations for the torques since the principle of relativity is
automatically satisﬁed in such an approach to SR which exclusively deals with 4D geometric quantities, i.e., AQs
or CBGQs. In the standard approach to SR [17] the principle of relativity is postulated outside the framework of a
mathematical formulation of the theory, and, as we already discussed, it is considered that the principle of relativity
holds for the equations written with the 3D quantities.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The whole consideration exposed in previous sections strongly suggests that the violation of the principle of relativity
and the existence of the electrodynamic paradox come from the use of the 3D quantities, as physical quantities in
the 4D spacetime, and from using their apparent transformations. We have shown that, in the 4D spacetime, the
well-deﬁned angular momentum with relativistically correct transformation properties is not the 3D vector L, with
its apparent transformations (22), but the Lorentz invariant 4D geometric quantities, the bivector M , or 1-vectors Ms
and Mt, which are derived from M and which together contain the same physical information as M . The same result
refers to the 3D torque N and the bivector N , or the torques Ns and Nt that together correspond to the torque N . It
is already proved in, e.g., [8 - 12], that the same situation exists with the 3D vectors E and B and the 4D geometric
quantities, the bivector F , or, derived from it, the 1-vectors E and B.

We hope that the results obtained in this paper will have important consequences for all branches of physics in which
the relativistic eﬀects have to be taken into account, particularly for classical and quantum relativistic electrodynamics.

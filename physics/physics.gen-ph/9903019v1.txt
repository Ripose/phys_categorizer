The phenomenon of frustrated total internal reﬂection illus-

trated in Figure 1 has been the subject of a considerable amount

of research (see [1] and references therein).

The explicit expression for the transit time in frustrated total

internal reﬂection has been obtained by Ghatak and Banerjee

[2]. This expression infered from the stationary phase analysis

has the form

k1 and k2 are wavenumbers in regions I and II, K is the
evanescent-wave wavenumber , v1 and v2 are group velocities
in regions I and II, n1 and n2 are refractive indexes, θi is the
incidence angle, ω is the frequency of the incoming wave, d is

the barrier width.

Another expression for the transit time has been recently

proposed by Jakiel, Olkhovsky and Recami [3]. This expression

infered from the analogy between photon and nonrelativistic-

particle tunneling has the form

for Kd

Note that formula (1) is valid for all available values of pa-

Therefore the main result (2) achieved in [3] can be derived by

the elementary computation from the Ghatak-Banerjee formula

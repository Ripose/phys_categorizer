Abstract

Space-like and time-like invariant space-time intervals are used to analyse measurements
of spatial and temporal distances. The former are found to be Lorentz invariant –there is no
‘relativistic length contraction’, whereas the latter exhibit the experimentally conﬁrmed ‘time
dilatation’ eﬀect, without, however, ‘relativity of simultaneity’. It is shown how the spurious
predictions of length contraction and relativity of simultaneity arise from the use of inconsistent
synchronisation procedures for spatially separated clocks.

PACS 03.30.+p

With a particular choice of coordinate axes and clock synchronisation convention, to

be discussed below, the space-time Lorentz transformationa (LT) may be written as:

x′ = γ[x − vt]
vx
t′ = γ[t −
c2 ]
y′ = y
z′ = z

where

γ ≡

1
p1 − ( v
In (1)-(4) the space-time coordinates x, y, z, t (E) and x′, y′, z′, t′ (E’) specify the same
event as observed in two inertial frames S and S’ respectively. The frame S’ is in uniform
motion relative to S with velocity v in the direction of the positive x-axis. The x-,x’-axes
and the y-,y’-axes are parallel and c is the speed of light in vacuum.

It was shown by Minkowski [6] that with every pair of events, E and E0 in S, and E′
0 in S’, with space-time coordinates connected by a LT , may be associated space-

and E′
like and time-like invariant intervals ∆s, ∆τ , respectively, according to the deﬁnitions:

(∆s)2 ≡ −c2(∆τ )2

≡ (∆x)2 + (∆y)2 + (∆z)2 − c2(∆t)2
= (∆x′)2 + (∆y′)2 + (∆z′)2 − c2(∆t′)2

aThe Lorentz Transformation (1)-(5) was ﬁrst written down in the Literature by Larmor in 1900 [1]. See [2] for
a discussion of the historical priority issues. It was independently derived by Einstein [3] and given by Poincar´e [4]
in 1905. The appellation ‘Lorentz Transformation’ is due to Poincar´e.
In Lorentz’s last pre-relativity paper [5]
another space-time transformation was given, from which the Lorentz Transformation (1)-(5) may be obtained by the
substitution: x → x − vt.

where ∆x ≡ x − x0, ∆t ≡ t − t0 etc. Suppose now that E′ and E′
0 are events on the world
line of a clock, A’, that is at rest in S’ at some ﬁxed position on the x’ axis. Since, in this
case, ∆x′ = ∆y′ = ∆z′ = 0, (6) may be written as:

c2(∆τ (A′))2 = c2(∆t(A′))2 − (∆x(A′))2 = c2(∆t′(A′))2

Since the clock A’ moves with uniform velocity v in the positive x-direction in S:

∆x(A′) = v∆t(A′)

Substituting (8) in (7) gives:

c2(∆τ (A′))2 = c2(∆t(A′))2(1 −

v2
c2 ) =

c2(∆t(A′))2
γ2

= c2(∆t′(A′))2

or

∆t(A′) = γ∆t′(A′) = γ∆τ (A′)

This equation describes the time dilatation eﬀect of SR – the clock A’ appears to be
running slower, to an observer in the frame S, by a factor 1/γ, as compared to the rate
seen by an observer in the frame S’ in which the clock is at rest.

Consider now a second clock, B’, also at rest on the x’ axis in S’. In terms of clock

times the time dilatation formulae for the clocks A’ and B’ are:

t(A′) − t0(A′) = γ[τ (A′) − τ0(A′)]
t(B′) − t0(B′) = γ[τ (B′) − τ0(B′)]

The parameters t0(A′), τ0(A′), t0(B′) and τ0(B′) describe the synchronisation of the clocks
A’ and B’. They can be given a simple operational deﬁnition by imagining that at the
ﬁrst the clocks are stopped and then, at a certain instant in S’, they are both started. In
this case τ0(A′) and τ0(B′) are the initial settings of the clocks. If this setting is the same
for A’and B’:

τ0(A′) = τ0(B′) ≡ τ ′

0(A′, B′)

and the clocks are said to synchronised. At the instant of synchronisation (i.e. when the
clocks are started) (11), (12) and (13) give the relation:

t0(A′) = τ0(A′) = τ ′

0(A′, B′) = τ0(B′) = t0(B′) = τ0(A′, B′)

(14)

Where τ0(A′, B′) is the time recorded by local synchronised clocks in S at the instant
when A’ and B’ are started. After synchronisation, (11) and (12) are then written as:

t(A′) − τ0(A′, B′) = γ[τ (A′) − τ ′
t(B′) − τ0(A′, B′) = γ[τ (B′) − τ ′

0(A′, B′)]
0(A′, B′)]

It follows from these equations that events which are simultaneous in S’ at the positions
of the clocks A’ and B’: τ (A′) = τ (B′) ≡ τ ′(A′, B′) are also observed to be simultaneous
in S:

′
t(A

) − τ

′
′
0(A

, B

)] + τ0(A

′

, B

) = t(B

)

′

A quite general consequence of this equation is that events which are judged to be simul-
tanous in S’ according to local synchronised clocks are also observed to be simultaneous
by such clocks in S –there is no ‘relativity of simultaneity’.

Suppose now that the separation of the clocks A’ and B’ is L′, i.e. L′ ≡ x′(B′)−x′(A′).

A space-like Lorentz-invariant interval ∆s(B′, A′) may be deﬁned as:

(∆s(B′, A′))2 ≡ (∆x(B′, A′))2 − c2(∆t(B′, A′))2 = (L′)2 − c2(∆τ ′(B′, A′))2

(18)

where

∆t(B′, A′) ≡ t(B′) − t(A′),

∆τ ′(B′, A′) ≡ τ (B′) − τ (A′)

(19)

In the frame S, the clocks are moving with a ﬁxed separation, L, in the direction of the
positive x-axis. This distance is measured by noting the positions of the clocks at some
instant, t, in the frame S and subtracting the corresponding x-coordinates:

L ≡ x(B′, t) − x(A′, t) ≡ ∆x(B′, A′)

where t = t(B′) = t(A′) or

When t(B′) = t(A′), (15) and (16) give τ (B′) = τ (A′) or

∆t(B′, A′) = 0

∆τ (B′, A′) = 0

∆s(B′, A′) = L = L′

Substituting (20),(21) and (22) in (18), and taking the positive square root gives:

Contrary, then, to what is claimed in the usual interpretation of special relativity, the
distance between two objects that are at rest in some inertial frame is a Lorentz invariant
quantity –there is no ‘length contraction’.

By considering the time dilatation eﬀect for two clocks A and B at rest along the
x-axis in S, and separated by the same distance, L, as A’ and B’ in S’, the following
formulae analogous to (15) and (16) are obtained.

t′(A) − τ ′
t′(B) − τ ′

0(A, B) = γ[τ (A) − τ0(A, B)]
0(A, B) = γ[τ (B) − τ0(A, B)]

0(A′, B′) and τ0(A, B) = τ ′

The parameters τ0(A′, B′) = τ ′

0(A, B) in(15),(16),(24) and
(25) are the readings of each pair of synchronised clocks (A’ and B’ in S, A and B in
S) at the instant of synchronisation and may be freely chosen without changing any
physical predictions. It still remains however to synchronise the clock pairs A-A’ and B-
B’. Suppose that the clocks A and A’ are synchronised at the instant at which they both
have the same x- and x’-coordinates. This could be done, for example, by stopping the
clocks, setting each clock to indicate the time τ0, and starting them both at the instant
at which their x- and x’-coordinates coincide. This means that:

so that (14) and the analogous relation for the clocks A and B gives: :

(26) and (27) imply that (15),(16), (25) and (26) become, after synchronisation of A with
A’ and B with B’:

t(A′) − τ0 = γ[τ (A′) − τ0]
t(B′) − τ0 = γ[τ (B′) − τ0]
t′(A) − τ0 = γ[τ (A) − τ0]
′
(B) − τ0 = γ[τ (B) − τ0]
t

The choice of clock setting parameters in (26) and (27) deﬁne a ‘sychronisation con-
vention’ for any pair of clocks, one in the frame S and the other in the frame S’. This
synchronisation convention has been applied above to the clock pairs A-A’ and B-B’, the
clock pairs A’-B’ and A-B having been previously synchronised in the frames S’ and S
according to (15),(16) and (24),(25) respectively.

The results just obtained concerning distance and time interval measurements were
derived solely from the operational deﬁnitions of such measurements and the Lorentz-
invariant interval relation (6). No particular coordinate system was speciﬁed. The results
will now be rederived using the LT. This calculation will reveal why the usual ‘length
contraction’ and ‘relativity of simultaneity’ predictions of conventional SR are erroneous.
The standard space-time LT of (1)-(5) corresponds to a particular choice of coordinate
axes and clock synchronisation convention. For an arbitary choice of these the LT is
written as:

(32)

x′ − x′

0 = γ[x − x0 − v(t − t0)]
v(x − x0)
c2

]

0 = γ[t − t0 −

0 = y − y0
0 = z − z0

t′ − t′
y′ − y′
z′ − z′
. The ‘standard’ LT of (1)-(5) corresponds to the choice t0 = t′
0 = 0 for the synchronisation
0 = y0 = y′
convention and x0 = x′
0 for the choice of coordinate axes. Thus
when x′ = t′ = 0 also x = t = 0. Placing the clock A’ at the origin of the x’ axis and
using the standard LT give, for events on the world line of A’, the transformations:
x′(A′) = γ[x(A′) − vt(A′)] = 0

0 = z0 = z′

(34)
(35)

(33)

(36)

Using (36) to eliminate x(A′) in (37) gives, after use of (5) and transposition

τ (A′) = γ[t(A′) −
y′(A′) = y(A′) = z′(A′) = z(A′) = 0

]

vx(A′)
c2

t(A′) = γτ (A′)

which is just the time dilatation relation (28) for the clock A’, with the choice τ0 = 0 for
the clock setting at the time of synchronisation. Using the same synchronisation conven-
tion as for A’ the LT of events on the world line of the clock B’ when it is synchronised
with A’

in S’ is:

Using (40) to eliminate x(B′) in (41), gives similarly to (39):

t(B′) = γτ (B′)

in agreement with (29) for τ0 = 0. The LT (36),(37) may be more simply written as:

x′(A′) = 0,

x(A′) = vt,

t = γτ ′

and that in (40),(41) as

x′(B′) = L,

x(B′) = vt + L,

t = γτ ′

where

t(A′) = t(B′) ≡ t,

τ (A′) = τ (B′) ≡ τ ′

(46)
Here τ ′ is the proper time of all synchronised clocks at rest in S’, while t is the apparent
(time-dilatated) time of all such clocks as viewed from S, or equivalently, the proper
time τ of all synchronised clocks at rest in S. Inspection of (44) and (45) shows that
x′(B′) − x′(A′) ≡ L′ = x(B′) − x(A′) ≡ L, for all values of t, in accordance with the
Lorentz invariant relation (23).

The standard text-book derivation of the ‘length contraction’ and ‘relativity of simul-
taneity’ eﬀects is now presented and discussed. What is done is to apply the standard
LT (1)-(5) not only to the clock A’ but also to B’. When this is done, in place of (40)
and (41) the following equations are obtained:

Subsituting t(A′) = 0 in (36),(37) and t(B′) = 0 in (47),(48) gives

Equation (51) may be re-witten as:

or

L = γLapp
(54)
where Lapp ≡ x(B′) − x(A′) is the apparent distance between A’ and B’ in S at t =
t(A′) = t(B′) = 0, according to (36),(37),(47) and (48). This is the ‘length contraction’
eﬀect of conventional special relativity. Equation (52) is interpreted as ‘relativity of
simultaneity’ – since τ (B′) 6= τ (A′), events which are simultaneous in S are not so in S’.
What it really shows however is that the use of the LT (1)-(5) for the clock B’ at x′ = L
does not synchronise the clock pair B-B’
in the same way as the pair A-A’. In fact, this
ansatz uses diﬀerent synchronisation conventions for the clock pairs A-A’ and B-B’. To

5

understand this, introduce the clocks A and B in S, coincident along the x-axis with A’
and B’ respectively, at the instant when t(A′) = τ (A) = t(B′) = τ (B) = 0. For the clock
A’, (39) gives τ (A′) = t(A′)/γ = 0. The LT (1)-(5) applied to A’ then corresponds to the
synchronisation convention of (26) for the clock pair A-A’ with τ0 = 0. i.e.

τ0(A) = τ0(A′) = τ0 = 0

where replacements τ (A′) → τ0(A′) etc have been made for consistency with the notation
of equations (13)-(16) and (24)-(27). If the clocks A and B are synchronised in S then
τ0(B) = τ0(A) = 0. However, according to (51) and (52) τ0(B′) = −vL/(γc2). The
synchronisation convention for the clock pair B-B’ is then:

(55)

(56)

τ0(B) = τ0(B′) +

vL
γc2 = τ0 = 0

which is evidently diﬀerent to that of the clock pair A-A’ in (55). Actually, comparison of
the (55) and (56) shows that with the synchronisation convention of (56) unlike the clocks
A and B in S, the clocks A’ and B’ are not synchronised in the frame S ’. This (and only
this) is the origin of the ‘relativity of simultaneity’ eﬀect of conventional special relativity
where the standard form (1)-(5) of the LT is universally employed for clocks at arbitary
spatial locations in the frame S’

Use of (43), following from the LT (40)-(41), shows instead that τ0(B′) = 0 when
t(A′) = t(B′) = 0. The synchronisation of the clocks A and B in S gives τ0(B) = τ0(A) = 0
so that instead of (56) the synchronisation convention for the clock pair B-B’ becomes:

τ0(B) = τ0(B′) = τ0 = 0

(57)

identical with that for the clock pair A-A’ in (55). In this case, unlike in (56), the clocks
A’ and B’ are synchronised in the frame S’ and the clocks A and B are synchronised in
the frame S.

The essential message of the present paper is then that, in an operational sense, i.e.
in its application to experimental physics, the LT does not primarily describe ‘space-time
geometry’ but rather how the times displayed by synchronised clocks appear to observers
in diﬀerent inertial reference frames.
Inspection of (44) and (45) shows that there is
a universal time dilatation eﬀect for clocks at rest in S’ and in motion in S but that
the equations containing spatial coordinates are the same as for a Galilean space-time
transformation, given by the c → ∞ limit of (1) and (2). Special relativity therefore
changes the classical concept of time but not that of space. A more detailed study
of this subject, including rigorous experimental deﬁnitions for measurements of spatial
and temporal intervals, as well as suggestions for several practical clock synchronisation
procedures, not making use of light signals, is presented in Ref. [7].

An immediate application of the above results is to the analysis of the train/embankment

gedankenexperiment [8] proposed by Einstein to introduce the concept of ‘relativity of
simultaneity’ before any mention of the LT. Two lightning strokes hit the embankment at
two points that coincide with the front and the end of the moving train at that instant.
There are observers mid-way between the points on the embankment and at the middle
of the train. The question is asked whether these observers will judge the strokes to be
simultaneous. It is clear from the time transformation equations in the LT (44) and (45)

6

that if the strokes are simultaneous in the embankment frame they will be observed to
be also simultaneous in the train frame, so that both observers must judge the strokes to
be simultaneous on receiving light signals generated by the strokes. Why the analysis of
these light signals lead Einstein to the erroneous conclusion that the strokes would not be
judged simultaneous by the observer on the train is discussed elsewhere [9]. In the same
paper it is shown that a ‘relativity of simultaneity’ eﬀect is indeed predicted by special
relativity, but not the one proposed by Einstein in Ref. [3, 8] nor that derived above from
the LT (47) and (48).

In order to use the same synchronisation convention for both pairs of clocks with one
in S’ and the other in S, the general prescription is always to use a ‘local’ LT, i.e. one in
which the coordinate origin of the frame in which the clock is at rest is at the position of
the clock. Such a local LT is deﬁned for the clock A’ discussed above by the LT (36)-(38).
The LT in (40) and (41) is converted to a local one by the coordinate transformations:
x − L → X and x′ − L → X ′. For the clock B’ for which x′(B′) = L, X ′(B′) = 0 so
that the coordinates (X, t), (X ′, t′) are local ones for the clock B’. In fact, after these
coordinate transformations, (40) and (41) are identical to the ’standard’ transformations
(1) and (2) with the replacements x → X and x′ → X ′. An extensive discussion of the
physical motivation and use of the local LT is presented in Ref. [10]. Unlike in some
applications of the standard LT, translational invariance is always respected and some
causal paradoxes [11, 12] of conventional special relativity are resolved.

Satellite borne experiments to test, for the ﬁrst time, the existence (or not) of the
‘relativity of simultaneity’ eﬀect arising from the exclusive use of the standard LT (1)-(5)
are proposed in Ref. [13].

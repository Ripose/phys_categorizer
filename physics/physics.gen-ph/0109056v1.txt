1 Introduction

In the recent papers [1-3], the detection of anomalous forces formed within
electron discharge from a superconductive ceramic emitter to a targeting
electrode has been described. It has been hypothesed that these forces are
of gravitational nature. The whole time of a discharge was 10−5 to 10−4 s,
the peak value of the current at the discharge was of the order 104 A, the
voltage varied in the range of 500 kV to 2 MV. The distance between the
electrodes was 15 cm to 2 m. Based on the total charge localized on the
0.1 C) the discharge energy approached 105 J. The gravity impulse
emitter (
accompanying the discharge propagated as a coherent beam in the same

∼

direction as the discharge and penetrated through diﬀerent media (air, brick
wall, steel plate) without any noticeable loss of energy. It acted on mobile
objects such as spherical 10 to 50 g weighing pendulums made from diﬀerent
materials (rubber, glass, metal, plastics) hanging on a cotton thread like a
repulsive force independent on the pendulum material and proportional to
their mass. Measurements of the impulse taken at the distance of 3 m, 6 m
and 150 m gave identical results.

The experiment was theoretically rationalized by Modanese [3] who stated
that the phenomenon could not be understood in the framework of general
relativity. He proposed an explanation combining a quantum gravity ap-
proach and anomalous vacuum ﬂuctuations.

In this contribution, an independent rationalization of the physical nature
of the Podkletnov’s experiments, explanation of diﬀerent eﬃciency reached
using two generators, and proposals for improvement of the eﬃciency are
oﬀered stemming from the background of the model of Expansive Nondecel-
erative Universe [4-8].

2 Background of the model of Expansive Non-

decelerative Universe

The basic principles of the Expansive Nondecelerative Universe model were
presented in a series of papers [4-8]. The model diﬀers from more frequently
used models of inﬂationary universe in the following features:
a) Schwarzschild metric is replaced by Vaidya metric,
b) the Universe permanently expands by the velocity of light c,
c) simultaneous creation of matter and the equivalent amount of gravitational
energy (which is, however, negative and thus the total value of mass-energy
is constant and equal zero) occurs.
d) the Einstein cosmological constant and the curvature index are of zero
value.

Statement b) can be expressed as follows

where a is the gauge factor, tc is the cosmological time, mU is the Universe
1052 kg, tc ∼=
mass (their present values are a ∼= 1.3
1.4

1026 m, mU ∼= 8.6

1010 yr).

Application of Vaidya metric in Cartesian Kerr-Schild coordinates was

nents are published elsewhere [11], in case of weak ﬁelds, its main component

the energy of a quantum of gravitational ﬁeld induced by a body with the

3 Interpretation of the Podkletnov’s results

stemming from the ENU

Within the Podkletnov’s experiments [1-3], electrostatic ﬁeld with the mean
voltage intensity

was applied which corresponds to the mean energy density

Comparing this value with that given by (14) it is obvious that

Our explanation of the Podkletnov’s phenomenon lies in a hypothesis
that the Earth gravitational ﬁeld interferes with the electrostatic ﬁeld cre-
ated within a discharge. The gravitational attractive force of the Earth

results from the attraction of a body (pendulum) by the whole Earth. Pro-
vided that it is the only force exerting on a body, its direction is vertical
as a result of the vector sum of attractive forces exerted by all the Earth
parts. Should the Earth gravitational ﬁeld be attenuated in a certain loca-
tion (direction) the other attractive forces prevail. The observed deﬂection of
pendulum thus results from ,,non-vertical“ Earth attraction. The pendulum
deﬂection is, therefore, not a consequence of a repulsive force created within
a discharge but lies in a local attractive force decreasing due to reducing the
Earth gravitational ﬁeld caused by its interference with electrostatic ﬁeld.

In the mathematical language the above ideas can be expressed as follows.
The energy density of the electrostatic ﬁeld is deﬁned as

where V is the applied voltage and rx is the distance between electrodes.
Based on (13), (14), (26), and (27) for the conditions on the Earth surface it
then follows that

εE =

εo.V 2
2r2
x

V 2

∼=

3m(Earth).c2.r2
x

(Earth).a

It is obvious that the optimal distance between the electrodes is

rx ∼= 0.2m
for the applied voltage of V = 500 kV, and

rx ∼= 0.85m

for V = 2 MV.

A theoretical treatment of (28) leads to a conclusion that to discharge
only one electron from the emitor at the voltage of V ∼= 1 V, it should hold
rx ∼= 10−7m

(31)

Such an electron would obtain the energy of 1 electronvolt, i.e.

which is close to the energy of a gravitational quantum at the Earth sur-
face (23). It can be, therefore, supposed that in cases when the requirement
(26) is fulﬁlled, each discharged electron creates one quantum of the Earth
It directly followed
gravitational ﬁeld irrespective to the voltage applied.

from (18) that the energy of a gravitational quantum depends on the energy
density only. At the Podkletnov’s experiment, the total charge localized on
the emitor at the voltage of 2 MV reached

(37)

which corresponds to a number of electrons

Q ∼= 0.1C

n(e) =

e ∼= 1018

Within a discharge at 2 MV, 1018 quanta of gravitational ﬁeld are formed,
each of them bearing the energy of about 10−19 J.

Podkletnov observed [3] that the total energy of a deﬂection depended on
the pendulum mass. This observation is consistent with (4) and (8) stating
that the higher the mass, the higher the eﬀective gravitational radius.
It
must hold for the potential energy of a displaced pendulum

∆E = m(P ).n(e).
|

Eg|

(kg−1)

where m(P ) is the mass of pendulum. For m(P ) = 18.5 g (data in [3] are
related to this pendulum mass) relation (35) leads to

∆E ∼= 1.8x10−3J
which is in good accordance with the experimental data obtained using both
a newer equipment (emitter 2)

(36)

∆E ∼= 1.3x10−3J

and an older one (emitter 1), where

(38)

∆E ∼= 2.3x10−3J
Stemming from (30) and comparing the values in (37) and (38) it is ob-
vious that the actual distance between the electrodes in a newer equipment
(0.15 to 0.4 m) was far from the optimal distance 0.85 m. We believe that
the rearrangement of a discharge chamber so as to permit to reach a higher
distance between the electrodes will lead to a higher alteration in the pen-
dulum potential energy. In addition, to preserve a high level of coherency
when applying higher voltages, the space between two electrodes should be
localized in an external magnetic ﬁeld having the intensity proportional to
rx.

Relation (35) can be obtained by an independent way too. A ﬂow of
the gravitational energy of the Earth, σ(Earth) through its surface unit (here-
inafter, all data are related to the surface of one square meter) is

σ(Earth) =

Pg(Earth)
4π.c.r(Earth)

where Pg(Earth) is the gravitational output of the Earth (15). Due to a close
proximity of the emitter and the pendulum and owing to coherent nature of
the pulses, it can be written

σ(P ) ∼= n(e).

where σ(P ) is the gravitational energy ﬂow from Podkletnov equipment through
a surface unit. In such a case it must hold for the energy of pendulum de-
ﬂection

The expression in parentheses is a constant of the value close to 1 C−1
m2 s−2. This is why (43) can be rewritten in a simpler form (and expressed
in the above unit) as

∆E ∼= Q.m(P )
Based on (34) and (35), as well as on the close numerical values of

and e, relations (44) and (35) become thus almost identical.

For a vertical deﬂection of the pendulum, h it can be written

h ∼=
where g is the Earth gravitational acceleration. Once again, it is obvious
from (45) that the vertical deﬂection of the pendulum depends only on the
total charge, i.e. on the voltage between the electrodes.

4 Prospectives of application of the Podklet-

nov’s phenomenon

The Podkletnov’s phenomenon seems to be in principle of qualitatively new
nature. If theoretically and experimentally proved more deeply, it could form
an advantageous standpoint to rationalize several open phenomena. In this
part its connection to the problems of ﬁre balls stability, the hydrogen atom
stability, and solar corona temperature is brieﬂy outlined (the treatment of
the problems in more details will be published elsewhere).
a) Stability of ﬁre-ball-like plasmatic bodies
Our calculations indicate that in a case of simultaneous shortening the
time of discharge and increasing the external magnetic ﬁeld intensity at the
voltage exceeding 500 kV, a stable plasmatic body with the radius of about
10 - 30 cm, similar to a ﬁre ball, might be formed. From the technical
point of view such an experiment is realizable since the kinetic energy of an
electron at V
500 kV is comparable to its rest energy. The success of the
experiment is conditioned mainly by the type of superconductive emittor.

≥

b) The hydrogen atom
The density of electromagnetic energy in the hydrogen atom is

ε(H) =

e2
4π.εo.r2

(H)

∼= 1012J/m3

(46)

Putting the hydrogen atom into the gravitational ﬁeld with a higher energy
density, it would transform to a neutron. It is surely not a coincidence that
the surface of a neutron star with the mass approaching 1030 kg and radius of
about 10 km (common parameters of neutron stars) is characterized by the
gravitational energy density close to that given by (46) (cf. 13). Evaluating
the issue from another angle, based on (13) and (46) it is possible to estimate
the parameters of neutron stars.

×

c) Solar corona temperature
The magnetic ﬁeld density of a pulse magnetic ﬁeld with the intensity
103 A/m is identical to the absolute value of the Earth
of about H ∼= 7
gravitational ﬁeld density. If a pendulum was positioned in such a magnetic
ﬁeld, each pulse would cause a displacement of the pendulum. A mean in-
tensity of the Sun magnetic ﬁeld is about 102 A/m, at some processes of
magnetic ﬁeld changes, however, the magnetic ﬁeld intensity rises up to 105
104 A/m
A/m. It is worth pointing out that at the intensity of about 4
the magnetic ﬁeld density is equal to the energy density of the Sun gravita-
tional ﬁeld. Interference of both the ﬁelds might, at certain circumstances,
increase the kinetic energy of particles forming the solar corona by means

×

of Podkletnov-like eﬀect and rise its temperature up to the present value of
106 K. The apparent uniformity of the solar corona temperature might be a
consequence of periodicity of the magnetic eﬀects.

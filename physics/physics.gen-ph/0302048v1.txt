Abstract

The non-linear relations between polarization strength and electric ﬁeld strength for
ferroelectrics, as well as magnetization strength and magnetic ﬁeld strength for ferromag-
netics, can be achieved by introducing the retarded electromagnetic interactions. The
electric and magnetic hysteretic loops in medium frequency alternating electromagnetic
ﬁelds can be described well. The basic phenomenological formula in current non-linear
optics can also be obtained in the high frequency ﬁelds. The results show that all of these
non-linear phenomena come from the retarded electromagnetic interaction.

PACS numbers: 75., 75.50-y, 77.80.-e, 42.65-k
According to classical electromagnetic theory, the Maxwell equations in medium are

∇ × ~E = −

∂ ~B
∂t

∇ · ~D = ρf

∇ × ~H = ~Jf +

∂ ~D
∂t

∇ · ~B = 0

The experiments show that for general non-ferroelectrics and non-ferromagnetics in weak
electromagnetic ﬁelds, the relations between electric polarization strength ~P and ~E, as well as
magnetization strength ~M and ~H are linear, connected by the so-called constructive equations

~D = ε0ε ~E = ε0 ~E + ~P

~B = µ0µ ~H = µ0( ~H + ~M )

~P = ε0χe ~E

~M = µ0χm ~H

Here χe is polarizability and χm is magnetic susceptibility individually with ε = 1 + χe,
µ = 1 + χm. For non-isotropy electric and magnetic mediums, the relations are still linear
with simple forms

~~χe : ~E
Here ~~χe is polarizability tensor and ~~χm is magnetic susceptibility tensor.

~M = µ0

~~χm : ~H

~P = ε0

However, the experiments also show that for ferroelectrics and ferromagnetics, as well
as in the strong ﬁelds, the relations between ~P and ~E, as well as ~M and ~H are non-linear
with great complexity. Their relations cant be deduced from theory at present. We now get
them only by phenomenological hypothesis. In the polarization and magnetization processes
of ferroelectrics and ferromagnetics, there exist hysteretic phenomena.
In the alternating
electromagnetic ﬁelds of low frequency (for example 0.1Hz), the magnetic hysteretic loops
and magnetization curve are shown in Figure 1. For ferromagnetics, M is much big than

(1)

H, so the shape of M ∼ H curve is similar to the shape of B ∼ H curve. The magnetic
hysteretic loops are near rectangle. In the ﬁgure, the maximum values M0 and H0 are at the
same point. By ﬁxing the frequency of magnetic ﬁeld and changing H0, we can get a series
of loops. Connecting the vertex of each loop, we get a curve, i.e., magnetization curve.

When the frequency becomes high, the hysteretic loops become smooth ellipses. When
the frequency becomes higher, the ellipses become near circular. Figures 2 and 3 are the
magnetic hysteretic loops of nickel-zinc ferrite in the magnetic ﬁelds with frequencies 1500Hz
and 500Hz individually.

When the frequencies are high enough, the maximum values B0 and H0 are not at the
same point. So we cant get the magnetization curves by the same method shown in Figure
1. By considering continuity of magnetization processes, in medium frequency ﬁelds, we
can estimate the basic sharps of magnetization curves below when the frequency and the
maximum value of magnetic ﬁeld are ﬁxed. Because magnetization curves must reach the
maximum value of magnetic ﬁeld but cant pass over the value, the magnetization curves can
take three forms shown in Figure 3, described in broken lines a, b and c. The curves a and b
are unclosed at ﬁrst several cycles. It needs some time for them to become stationary loops.
Curve c can smoothly enter stationary loop at its ﬁrst cycle before it reaches the maximum
point of magnetic ﬁeld.
In fact, the situation is the same for magnetization curve in low
frequency ﬁelds. The Loops shown in Figure 1 are only stationary ones. At the beginning
of magnetization processes, they should also be unclosed. The forms of hysteretic loops and
polarization curves ferroelectrics are the same as ferromagnetics.

Figure 4:

It is still an unsolved problem how to deduce the function forms of hysteretic loops and
polarization curves in theory now. What we have at present are the experimental formulas
for ferromagnetics provided by L.Rayleigh in 1887 (1)

B = µ0(µH + bH 2)

B = µ0(µ + bH0)H ± µ0

(H 2

0 − H 2)

(6)

The formulas are only suitable for weak ﬁelds. In the formula, µ is initial magnetic suscepti-
bilities, b is a constant. The positive sign is for the up-line of formula of magnetic hysteretic
loop and the negative sign for down-line. Suppose alternating magnetic ﬁeld is H = H0 sin ωt,
let α = bH0/µ, Eq.(6) can be written as

B = µ0µH0(sin ωt + αsin2ωt)

B = µ0µH0[(1 + α) sin ωt ±

α
2

cos2ωt]

(7)

Take α = 1, let H0 as the unit of abscissa, B0/(2µ0µ) as the unit of ordinate, we can get the
magnetic hysteretic loop and magnetization curve shown in Fig.4. It can be seen that the
loop is not an approximate rectangle, so it dose not consistent with Figure 1 in low frequency
condition. It is not smooth and continuous at the maximum points, so it dose not consistent
with Figure 2 and 3 in medium frequency ﬁelds. Meanwhile,. B0 and H0 are at the same
point in ﬁgure 3, but the real situation is that they should not for the existence of phase
diﬀerence between them.

It is proved below that after retarded electromagnetic interaction is introduced, the non-
linear relations between polarization strength and electric ﬁeld strength, as well as magneti-
zation strength and magnetic ﬁeld strength can be obtained. Based on soft modal theory, the
electric and magnetic hysteretic loops, as well as polarization and magnetization curves can
be described well in the alternating electromagnetic ﬁelds of low and medium frequencies.
The phenomenological formula used in non-linear optics can also be obtained by the same
method in high frequency ﬁelds, meaning that the retarded electromagnetic interaction is the
origin of all these non-linear phenomena.

The polarization of ferroelectrics is discussed at ﬁrst. According to the current theory,
there exist small electrical domain structures in ferroelectrics under critical temperature.
When the electrical polar moments in domains arrange in parallel, energy is lowest so that
the system is most stable. Owing to the random distribution of polarization directions of
electrical domains, when there exist no external ﬁelds, whole ferroelectrics are electrically
neutral. When external electrical ﬁeld is added, the polarization directions of domains are
turned to the direction of electrical ﬁeld, so that ferroelectrics show strong polarization. In
alternating electrical ﬁeld E = E0 sin ωt, the motion equation of an electrical polar moment
is

The second item on the left side of equation represents the damping forces caused by collision
and radiation and so on with β > 0. The third item represents restoring force and, ω0 is the
nature frequency of dipole and q is dipoles charge. The solution of Eq.(8) is

r = A sin(ωt − θ0) + Ce−βt sin(qω2

0 − β2t − ϑ)

A =

θ0 = tg−1(

On the other hand, according to the soft modal theory of ferroelectrics (2), under critical
temperature, the vibrations of lattices are frozen for the Coulombian forces and restoring

(8)

(9)

(10)

forces of irons are just oﬀset each other, when there exist no external electric ﬁelds. In this
case, the dipoles would not vibrate with ω0 = 0.

So let ω0 = 0 in Eq.(8), the solution of the i-th dipoles motion equation becomes

(11)

Here Bi and Ci are constants depending on initial condition. According to the theory of soft
modal, when t = 0 we have ri = ri0 and vi = vi0 = 0. For simpliﬁcation, let Bi = 0, by
relation, tgθi0 = −2βi/ω, we get

ri0 = −Ai sin θi0

positive, θi0 is in the third or fourth quadrant. From tgθi0 = −2βi/ω, θi0 is in the second or
the fourth quadrant. So θi0 should be in the fourth quadrant. Similarly, if ri0 is negative, θi0
should be in the second quadrant. From Eq.(11) and (12) we get

ri = Ai sin(ωt − θi0) −

vi = Aiω cos(ωt − θi0) − Aiω cos θi0e−2βit (13)

The retarded electromagnetic interaction is introduced below. Let t, ~ri, ~vi, ~ai and ˙~ai rep-
resent retarded time, coordinate, velocity, acceleration and acceleration of acceleration, t, ~ri,
~vi, ~ai and ˙~ai represent non-retarded time, coordinate, velocity, acceleration and acceleration
of acceleration. A particle with charge qi, velocity ~vi and acceleration ~ai at space point ~ri(t)
and time t would cause retarded potentials at point ~ri(t) and time t as follows

4πε0(1 − ~vi·~nij

)rij

c

~Aij =

qi~vi

4πε0c2(1 − ~vi·~nij

)rij

c

(14)

In the formula ~rij(t, t) = ~ri(t) − ~ri(t), t = t − rij(t)/c, rij =| ~rij |, ~nij = ~rij/rij. When
vi << c, the retarded distance rij(t) at retarded time t can be replaced approximately by
non-retarded distance rij(t), i.e., we can let t = t − rij(t)/c → t − rij(t)/c and get

rij(t, t) =| ~rj(t) − ~ri(t) |=| ~rj(t) − ~ri[t − rij(t)/c] |→| ~rj(t) − ~ri[t − rij(t)/c] |= rij(t)

(15)

It is noted that rij(t) 6= rij(t), for rij(t) is the approximate retarded distance, but rij(t) is
not the retarded distance. In this case, we can develop retarded quantities into series in light
of small quantity rij/c. By relation ~vi = d~ri/dt, ~ai = d2~ri/dt2, ˙~ai = d3~ri/dt3 · ··, we get (3)

~rij(t, t) ≃ ~ri(t) − ~rj(t − rij/c) = ~ri(t) − ~rj(t) +

When t is big enough, we have e−2βit → 0, the second item on the left side of Eq.(13) can be
omitted, so we have ~rij = ~Ai sin(ωt − θ0) as well as

~vi = ~Aiω cos(ωt − θi0)

~ai = − ~Aiω2 sin(ωt − θi0)

˙~ai = − ~Aiω3 cos(ωt − θi0)

(19)

If there is only one electrical dipole, the directions of ~rij, ~vi, ~ai and ˙~ai are on the same straight
line. In this case, Eq.(18) can be written as

Pi =

Here αi = qi cos θi0/(cmiω). In this way, the non-linear relation between polarization strength
of ferroelectrics and electrical ﬁeld strength is introduced automatically. The order of mag-
nitude of non-linear items or the value of parameter αi = qi/(cmiω) is estimated below.
For ferroelectrics composed of BaT iO3, mi = 8.02 × 10−26Kg is the mass of Ti iron with
qi = 4e. Let θi0 = 0 for simpliﬁcation, we can get αi = 2.66 × 10−2/ω. Taking ω = 2π × 103,
E0 = 103 V /M , we have αiE0 = 0.42. The non-linear eﬀect is quite strong. Similar, for O
iron, mi = 2.67 × 1.67 × 10−26Kg, qi = −2e, we have αiE0 = −0.64. If frequency becomes
lower, the non-linear eﬀect would become bigger, for example, taking ω = 20π, E0 = 103V /A,
we have αiE0 = 4.2 for T i iron and αiE0 = 64 for O iron. When frequency becomes high,
the non-linear items become small, when frequency become high enough, the non-linear ef-
fect would become small enough so that it cant be observed. The frequency is just so-called
cut-oﬀ frequency. On the other hand, if the natural frequency of dipole ω0 6= 0, we have
ω0 = 1014 ∼ 1016 >> ω. When electrical ﬁeld is not very strong, for example E0 = 106V /M ,
we have αiE0 = 10−6 ∼ 10−8, the non-linear eﬀect is too weak to be observed. So the
hypotheses of lattice vibrating frozen in soft modal theory is important for us to get observ-
able non-linear relation. It is obvious that all results above coincide with experiments. The
parameters of each item in Eq.(20) are ±(αiE0)n/n!. Because αiE0 is ﬁnite, when n → ∞
we have (αiE0)n/n! → 0. Write the n item of the series as Sn, we have Sn+1/Sn ∼ αiE0/n.
When n → ∞ we have Sn+1/Sn → 0, So the series is convergent. Though when frequency
is low and electric ﬁeld is not very high and n is not very big, we can have (αiE0)n/n! > 1,
even (αiE0)n/n! >> 1. In this case many items are needed to engage enough accuracy.

Eq.(20) is based on simple model, but practical ferroelectrics are very complex. For
practical ferroelectrics, many factors should be considered, for example, the practical lattice
structure, pseudo spin waves and statistical nature of system, interactions between dipoles,
as well as interactions between irons and electrons and so on. We can put all of those factors
in a nutshell as a factor ki, and write the polarization relation of practical ferroelectrics as

In the formula, x1 and y1 can be regarded independent each other, so we regard them as the
ordinates of the points in a plane. Let χe1 = qx2
1, y1/x1 = tgθ1, we can always write
x1 and y1 as x1 = χe1 cos θ1 and y1 = χe1 sin θ1. So Eq.(23) can be re-written as

Because of sin θi0 = cos(π/2 − θi0), it can be considered to be the same to take sum over
sin θi0 | cos θi0 | and over cos θi0 | sin θi0 |. So we have z2 = z2. In this way, there are three

write Eq.(26) as

Similarly, the third item has four independent parameters χ3, θ4, θ5, θ6, and the third item
has ﬁve independent parameters χ4, θ7, theta8, θ9, θ10, and so on. At last, Eq.(22) can be
written as

The parameters χen and θn are diﬀerent for diﬀerent ferroelectrics and can be determined by
experiments. The formula can also be written as

Here bn = χen−1En−1
/χe1 with bn → 0 when n → ∞. Then, we consider the simplest
situation to take two items in (31). Let b1 = 0.1, bn = 0(n > 1) and θ1 = θ2 = θ3 = θ. When
ωt = θ we get P = 0. In this case θ is just the polarization hysteretic phase. Take θ = 300
and 600. Tate E0 as the unit of abscissa, let P0 represent the maximum value of P and take
P0/(ε0χe1) as the unit of ordinate, we get the hysteretic loops shown in Fig.5 and 6. They
coincide with practical results in the medium frequency ﬁelds.

For low frequencies ﬁelds, we stochastically take b1 = 0.400, b2 = 0.256, b3 = 0.461,
b4 = 0.164, b5 = 0.665, b6 = 0.184, b7 = −0.419, b8 = 0.0420, b9 = 0.034, b10 = 0.027,

θ7 = 6.000, θ8 = 1.200, θn>8 = 1.050 + (2n)mod6, get Fig.7. Similarly, take b1 = 0.464,
b2 = 0.147, b3 = 0.067, b4 = 0.164, b5 = 0.475, b6 = 0.021, b7 = −0.042, b8 = 0.042,
b9 = 0.034, b10 = 0.027, bn>10 = 0, θ1 = 0.270, θ2 = 3.180, θ3 = 1.780, θ4 = 0.080,
θ5 = 0.160, θ6 = 3.030, θ7 = 5.580, θ8 = 5.560, θn>8 = 1 + 0.200n, get Fig.8. Two of them
are good rectangles, showing that Eq.(31) can also be used to describe the hysteretic loops
in low frequency ﬁelds.

As for polarization curves, by using Eq.(12), Eq.(22) can be written as

sin θi0

Similar to Eq.(30), by considering relation 2βit =| tgθi0 | ωt, the formula above can be written
as

P = ε0χe1E0{sin(ωt − θ1) + g1e−k1|tgθ1|ωt
+b1[cos(ωt − θ2) + g2e−k2|tgθ2|ωt] | sin(ωt − θ3) + g3e−k3|tgθ2|ωt |} · ··

(33)

Though each electrical domain is polarized, whole ferroelectrics are medium generally at
beginning. The initial condition is P = 0 when t = 0. Only taking ﬁrst two items, we have
g1 = sin θ1, g3 = sin θ3 and get at last

P = ε0χe1E0{sin(ωt − θ1) + sin θ1e−k1|tgθ1|ωt

+b1[cos(ωt − θ2) + g2e−k2|tgθ2|ωt] | sin(ωt − θ3) + sin θ3e−k3|tgθ2|ωt |}

(34)

The parameters ki > 0, the value should be decided by experiments. Taking θ1 = θ2 = θ3 =
θ = 300, b = 0.1, k1 = k2 = k3 = 1, g2 = 1, we get polarization curve shown in Fig.5. Taking
θ = 600, b = 0.1, k1 = k2 = k3 = 0.1, g2 = − cos 600 = −0.5, we get polarization curve shown
in Fig.6.

The results are the same for the magnetic hysteretic loops and magnetization curves of
ferromagnetics. As we known that magnetic phenomena can be equivalently described by
the concept of magnetic charges. According to quantum mechanics, there exist the exchange
forces between charges. When magnetic moments in magnetic domains are arranged in
parallel, the systems energy is lowest so that the system is most stable. Magnetic moments are
caused when electrons move around atomic nucleuses. If there is no external ﬁeld, electrons
motions are stationary and the magnetic moments of atoms are also stationary without
varying with time. The situation is similar to the soft modal theory of ferroelectrics. So we
can thinks that the vibration of magnetic dipole is frozen with nature frequency ω0 = 0 when
external ﬁelds do not exist. In this way, Eq.(11) can also be used to described the motion of
magnetic dipole in alternating magnetic ﬁeld. Similar to Eq.(20), in the alternating magnetic
ﬁeld ~H = ~H0 sin ωt, the magnetic moment of a single magnetic dipole is

Mi =

The order of magnitude of parameter αi = qi/(cmiω) is estimated below. It is known that
only out-shell electrons have contribution to magnetic moments. Suppose there is only one
out-shell electron in an atom, each atom has a magnetic moment called Bohr magneton
Mi = µ0e¯h/(2m3) ≃ 1.2 × 10−29W b · M . Suppose the distance between atoms is about
ri ≃ 10−10N · M/A, according to the deﬁnition of magnetic moment, Mi = riqi, we have
the value of equivalent magnetic charge qi ≃ 1.2 × 10−19W . The value is similar to electrons
charge. If atomic nucleus or iron is considered at static and electron moves, mi should be
electrons mass, we have αi = 4.4 × 102/ω, much big than that of ferroelectrics. Taking
ω = 2π × 102, H0 = 0.1A/M , we have αiH0 = 0.7 with strong non-linearity. If mi is regarded

(35)

as the masses of atomic nucleus or iron, the order of magnitude of αi is similar to that of
ferroelectrics. In practical situations, eﬀective masses will be taken. Similar to Eq.(30), we
have

M = µ0H0[µ1 sin(ωt − θ1) + µ2H0 cos(ωt − θ2) | sin(ωt − θ3) |

+µ3H 2

0 sin(ωt − θ4) | sin(ωt − θ5) sin(ωt − θ6) |

+µ4H 3

(36)

The magnetic hysteretic loops can also be described well by the formula above. We can also
get similar formula to describe magnetization curves of ferromagnetics, but discuss no any
more here.

The same method can be used to describer the non-linear phenomena in optics.
In
the current non-linear optics, interaction between light and materials is described by half-
classical method, i.e., to use classical theory of electromagnetic ﬁeld to describe lights motion
and quantum theory to describe interaction between photons and material particles. The
non-linear phenomena can be dealt with well by the non-linear polarization formula (4)

~P = ε0(χe1 ~E + χe2 · ~E ~E + ~~χe3 : ~E ~E ~E · ··)

(37)

Because optical crystal is not ferroelectrics in general, we regard atoms and molecular
as dipoles with nature frequency ω0 6= 0. The motion equation and solution of dipoles are
Eq.(8) and (9). When t → ∞, the polarization can also be described by Eq.(30). Taking
θ1 = θ3 = θ5 = θ6 = θ7 = θ8 = θ9 = θ10 = θ, theta2 = θ7 = θ + 3π/2, in spite of the phase
diﬀerence θ thought it exist actually, we get

~P = ε0(χe1 ~E + χe2 · E ~E + χe3E2 ~E · ··)

(38)

The result is similar to Eq.(37), from it most of non-linear phenomena just as multiple
frequencies, sum frequencies and diﬀerent frequencies and so on will be described. If non-
isotropy of crystal is considered, we should write (38) as (37). Tt should be noted that
Eq.(37) is only a special situation of Eq.(30).

Because nuclear mass is much big than electrons mass, the displacement of electron caused
by external ﬁeld is much big than nuclear one, so we can think that nucleus is at rest in
center and electron vibrates around center. Suppose the wavelength of incident light is
λ = 4 × 10−7M , mi is electron mass, we have αi = qi/(cmiω) ≃ 1.2 × 10−13M/V The
strength of electric ﬁeld of laser used in non-linear optics is about E0 ∼ 1010V /M in general,
so αiE0 ∼ 10−3means that the radio between the ﬁrst item and second item in Eq.(38) is about
10−3. The value coincides with experiments with αi = 10−12 ∼ 10−13, αiE0 = 10−3 − 10−4(5).
If the light used is not laser with E0 < 107V /M in general, we have αiE0 < 10−6, the
non-linear eﬀects are too weak to be observed.

In order to explain the origin of non-linear phenomena in optics and get Eq.(37) in theory,
the non-linear oscillator model is used at present. The motion equation of oscillator is written
as (4)

d2r
dt2 + 2β

dr
dt

+ ω2

0r + Dr2 =

F
m

(39)

In the formula, mDr2 is a non-linear force to cause non-linear eﬀects. However, it can be seen
that the origin of this item is still unclear. Where it comes from? Why does it not taking the
form such as mDr1/2 or mDr3 and so on? The current theory cant provide clear explanation.
Meanwhile, the value of parameter D cant be decided by theory now. Quantum mechan-
ics provides a method of perturbation approximation to calculate polarizability, but cant
yet explain the origin of non-linear phenomena. It is obvious that by introducing retarded
electromagnetic interaction, we can explain the origin of non-linear eﬀects in ferroelectrics,

ferromagnetics and optics well in a united form from the macro-angle of classical electromag-
netic theory. The result also prompts us to consider retarded interaction in quantum theory
to get more accurate description of ferroelectrics, ferromagnetics, non-linear optics and other
ﬁelds.

On the other hand, it can be seen that Eq.(14) can not keep unchanged under time reversal
with ~vi → −~vi, meaning that retarded electromagnetic interaction is asymmetry under time
reversal. It is the same in Eq.(16) under time reversal with ~vi → −~vi, ~ai → ~ai, ˙~ai → − ˙~ai,
meaning that ~r also violates symmetry of time reversal. So in the non-liner processes of
ferroelectrics, ferromagnetics and non-linear optics, symmetry of time reversal is violated
obviously. In fact, the polarization and magnetization processes that electromagnetic ﬁelds
change along positive directions are just the time reversal processes in which the ﬁelds change
along negative directions. The hysteresis loops shapes are similar to that in the cycle processes
of heat engines, both are irreversible to produce dissipative heat. For the polarization and
magnetization processes of ferroelectrics and ferromagnetics, only electromagnetic interaction
is involved. So the irreversibility is caused only by electromagnetic interaction itself, or
speaking strictly, by retarded electromagnetic interaction.
It is impossible to explain this
kind of irreversibility by the theories of coarse graining and mixing current and so on as
advocated in current statistical mechanics.

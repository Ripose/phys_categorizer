On Possibility of Coulomb Interaction between Masses and

Electrical Charges

Dmitriy Palatnik∗

Abstract

From non-linear modiﬁcation of Maxwell-Einstein theory, considered in
[3], follows modiﬁed Coulomb law for interaction between charged objects.
Namely, if (m, e) and (m′, e′) are masses and charges of two objects, then the
potential energy of interaction, V (r) = [ee′ − kmm′ − κ(em′ + e′m)]/r, where
κ = lc2 tan ψ. It follows, that the Earth possesses negative electric charge,
QE = −κME. Obtained result explains, why do primary cosmic rays consist
mainly of positive charges. Knowing the fairweather electric ﬁeld at surface
of Earth [1], and associating it with the charge QE in the center of the Earth,
one obtains an estimate κ ≈ 10−13 (CGS).

In [3] a non-linear in vector potential modiﬁcation of the Maxwell theory was suggested.

According to formula (2.14) in [3], electrical charge, e, contributes to gravitational mass, i.e.

∆m =

tan ψ e ,

lc2
k

where l and ψ are constants of the theory, and c and k are speed of light and Newtonian

constant of gravitational interaction. In non-relativistic limit and in linear approximation

in l, the electromagnetic potential, A0 = l−1 sin(lϕ) + l−1 tan ψ cos(lϕ), satisﬁes equation,

∆ϕ = −4π (cid:16)ρ − lc2 tan ψ µ(cid:17) ,

where ρ and µ are charge and mass densities, respectively, given in standard units. From

eq. (0.2) follows, that mass, m, contributes to observable electrical charge of the object:

Introducing a new constant, κ, according to relation

one may ﬁnd observable charge, Q = e + ∆e, and mass, M = m + ∆m:

∆e = −lc2 tan ψ m .

κ = lc2 tan ψ > 0 ,

Q = e − κ m ;

M = m +

e .

k

Consider now interaction between charges (e′, m′) and (e, m). Potential energy of (e′, m′)

in the ﬁeld generated by (e, m), is V (r) = (e′Q − km′M)/r, which follows from the theory.

Substituting (0.5), (0.6) into this formula, one obtains the potential energy,

V (|r − r′|) =

ee′ − kmm′ − κ(em′ + e′m)
|r − r′|

.

New eﬀect (proportional to κ) may be responsible for interaction between cosmic charged

particles (protons, electrons, etc.) and the Earth’s charge, QE = −κME. Here ME is the

Earth’s mass. Negative contribution of the Earth’s mass to observable charge explains, why

be estimated if the fairweather electric ﬁeld (100 Volts per metre at surface of the Earth)

[1] is attributed to charge QE, placed in the center of the Earth. The estimate is κ ≈ 10−13

(CGS).

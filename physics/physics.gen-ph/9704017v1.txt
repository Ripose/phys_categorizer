Abstract

If textbook Lorentz invariance is actually a property of the equations describing a
sector of the excitations of vacuum above some critical distance scale, several sectors of
matter with diﬀerent critical speeds in vacuum can coexist and an absolute rest frame (the
vacuum rest frame) may exist without contradicting the apparent Lorentz invariance felt by
”ordinary” particles (particles with critical speed in vacuum equal to c , the speed of light).
Sectorial Lorentz invariance, reﬂected by the fact that all particles of a given dynamical
sector have the same critical speed in vacuum, will then be an expression of a fundamental
sectorial symmetry (e.g. preonic grand uniﬁcation or extended supersymmetry) protecting
a parameter of the equations of motion. Furthermore, the sectorial Lorentz symmetry
may be only a low-energy limit, in the same way as the relation ω (frequency) = cs
(speed of sound) k (wave vector) holds for low-energy phonons in a crystal. We study the
consequences of such a scenario, using an ansatz inspired by the Bravais lattice as a model
It then turns out that: a) the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin
for some vacuum properties.
cutoﬀ on high-energy cosmic protons and nuclei does no longer apply; b) high-momentum
unstable particles have longer lifetimes than expected with exact Lorentz invariance, and
may even become stable at the highest observed cosmic ray energies or slightly above.
Some cosmological implications of superluminal particles are also discussed.

1 . VACUUM EXCITATIONS AND ”ELEMENTARY” PARTICLES

Sparnay and Lamoreaux [1] have experimentally conﬁrmed the Casimir eﬀect [2 - 4]
based on the quantum-ﬁeld-theoretical interpretation of elementary particles, which states
that quantum ﬁelds are harmonic oscillators in vacuum and have therefore a nonzero
ground energy. Thus, the so-called ”elementary particles” are actually quantum oscillators
of vacuum degrees of freedom and conventional quantum ﬁeld theory is based on the
harmonic approximation to these oscillators. Quantum mechanics seems to arise at a
deeper level than the description of the so-called ”free particles”. This raises a fundamental
question: can matter be understood just from a phenomenological study of the excitations
of vacuum? Obvioulsy, the matter forming a ionic crystal cannot be described just in
terms of the crystal phonon spectrum. On the other hand, our present knowledge of
vacuum excitations (quarks, leptons, gluons, electroweak gauge bosons, string models...)
is likely to contain, if correctly interpreted, important information on vacuum dynamics
itself. A most remarkable fact is that all the above-mentioned excitations of vacuum seem
to have the same critical speed in this medium. The dynamical origin of such a symmetry
is far from trivial if we adopt the philosophy that the apparent structure of space and time,
as seen by matter, is actually determined by the properties of matter itself (e.g. [5 - 11]).
This would not really be an unorthodox approach, as standard (inﬂationary) cosmology
generates space from the expansion (creation) of matter.

1a. Vacuum and particles: an analogy with the Bravais lattice

To understand, in the absence of absolute prescriptions from an intrinsic space-time
geometry, the meaning of this apparent universality of the critical speed in vacuum, we can
attempt a simple analogy with solid state physics. Assume a classical system similar to
the monoatomic one-dimensional Bravais lattice [12] with a very large number of coupled
oscillators regularly spaced by a , π times the inverse of the critical wave vector k0 (k0
and −k0 leading to the same wave function). On each site n , a complex parameter φ(n)
satisﬁes an equation implying nearest-neighbour coupling, i.e. :

d2/dt2 [φ (n)] = K [2 φ (n) − φ (n − 1) − φ (n + 1)] − ω2

rest φ

(1)

which admits, for wave vector k (−k0 ≤ k ≤ k0), solutions of the type:

φk(n , t) = φk (0) exp [i (k n a − ω t)]

(2)

with

ω2 (k) = 2 K [1 − cos (k a)] + ω2

rest = 4 K sin2 (ka/2) + ω2

rest

(3)

which, at low k and taking positive energy solutions, can be written as:

ω (k) ≃ [K (a k)2 + ω2

rest]1/2

(4)

as in standard special relativity. We expect ωrest = 0 as long as global ﬂuctuations have
no energy. Each plane wave φk(n , t) can be viewed as a complex harmonic oscillator. The

2

speed dω/dk is basically determined by the spring constant K and the critical wavelength
k0 = π a−1 . With the above approximations, and interpreting the lattice as the physical
vacuum, a classical massive ﬁeld is obtained which can be quantized to give a charged
massive particle. By this simple procedure, a particle has been generated whose critical
speed in vacuum is explicitly related to dynamical parameters of this vacuum (K , a).
If, as it seems to occur in our world, many particles have the same critical speed in
vacuum, they must correspond to oscillators with the same values of these dynamical
parameters. The observed symmetries must correspond to symmetries of the inner vacuum
dynamics (preonic symmetry, supersymmetry...) and may survive beyond the scales where
the particles cease to exist. Instead of a complex parameter, we can take in the previous
example a unitary operator u (n , n − 1) associated to links between sites. If u (n , n − 1)
belongs to the unitary group U (N) , λ is a hermitic generator of U (N) and α a real
parameter, the plane wave:

uk (n , n − 1 ; t) = exp [i (k n a − ω t)] exp (i α λ)

(5)

satisﬁes the equation:

d2/dt2 [u (n , n − 1)] = K [2 u (n , n − 1) − u (n − 1 , n − 2) − u (n + 1 , n)] (6)

for:

ω2 (k) = 2 K [1 − cos (k a)] = 4 K sin2 (ka/2)

The hermitic vector ﬁeld, which satisﬁes (6) and (7) similar to u , is actually:

A (n , n − 1) = (2i)−1 [u (n , n − 1) − u (n − 1 , n)]

(7)

(8)

where u (n − 1 , n) = u† (n , n − 1) . A is hermitic and contains both positive and
negative frequencies:

2 Ak (n , n − 1) = a†

k exp [−i (k n a − ω t)] + ak exp [i (k n a − ω t)]

(9)

where ak = − i exp (i α λ) . In this way, nine massless bosons can be generated, as
λ varies, possibly equivalent to a set of U(N) gauge bosons. Matter ﬁelds will exhibit
(up to a mass) the same relation between energy and momentum as gauge ﬁelds if they
oscillate with the same parameters K and a as the internal symmetry links, which can be
a natural assumption if in both cases we are dealing with nearest-neighbour interactions of
the same family of degrees of freedom. In this scenario, the violation of Lorentz symmetry
introduced at high energy by equations (3) and (7) will not be accompanied by a breaking
of the universality of the relation between energy and momentum in the zero-mass limit.
Although masses and other related phenomena will introduce low-energy corrections to
this universality, the high-momentum dynamics can keep it unbroken. An ansatz for a
general formula describing kinematics in the vacuum rest frame can be as before:

ω2 (k) = 2 K [1 − cos (k a)] + (2π)2 h−2 E2

rest

(10)

where h is the Planck constant and Erest the rest energy of the particle. The ”speed of
light”, as measured at low energy in the limit k → 0 , is c = K 1/2 a . The inertial mass
of the particle in the same limit is, as usual, m = Erest c−2 .

3

In such an analogy, no basic principle would prevent the vacuum from having other
sets of degrees of freedom oscillating with diﬀerent values of a and K . These degrees of
If Ki
freedom may generate superluminal sectors of matter, as considered in [5 - 11] .
and ai are the values of K and a for the i-th superluminal sector, we may try for these
superluminal particles in the vacuum rest frame the ansatz:

ω2 (k) = 2 Ki [1 − cos (k ai)] + (2π)2 h−2 E2

rest

(11)

i

, and ci = K

ai = π Ki k−1

where, from [5 - 10] , the mass of the particle is related to its rest energy by the relation
Erest = m c2
, where ki is the critical wavelength.
i
Interaction between diﬀerent dynamical sectors would then lead to energy and momentum
transfer between diﬀerent kinds of excitation modes. As stressed in [5 - 11] , the superlu-
minal particles we consider would not be tachyons and would have quite diﬀerent physical
properties from those predicted for tachyonic objects [13] . Contrary to tachyons, the
new superluminal particles necessarily violate the relativity principle [14] and would pro-
duce ”Cherenkov” radiation (spontaneous emission of particles with lower critical speed)
in vacuum (see [5 - 11] , and also [15]). They can play an important role in high-energy
phenomena, as well as in cosmology, and yield detectable signatures at accelerators (e.g.
LHC) or in cosmic ray experiments (e.g. AMANDA [16]).

Obviously, kinematics from (10) and (11) is just a rough example parameterizing possi-
ble trends of scenarios where Lorentz invariance is only a low-energy limit and ”ordinary”
particles (those with critical speed in vacuum equal to c , the speed of light) cease to exist at
distance scales below a . However, it may allow for useful discussions of Lorentz symmetry
violation and of other related phenomena. Consequences in cosmology can be important,
especially for the Big Bang scenario [17 , 18] . Quantum ﬁeld theory [19 - 21] should take
these penomena into account, especially when discussing cutoﬀs and renormalization, but
its validity is not in principle altered by their existence. Contrary to tachyons [22 , 23] ,
the proposed superluminal particles would not violate causality [10] . From formula (10) ,
the velocity of an ”ordinary” particle would be (E = energy, p = momentum):

v = dE/dp = dω/dk = K 1/2 c ω−1 sin (k a)

(12)

which tends to zero as k approaches ±πa−1 . Thus, a particle with the highest per-
mitted energy and wave vector would be at rest (zero speed) with respect to the vac-
uum rest frame, even if it has a high momentum. In this limit, the frequency tends to
ωmax = [4 K + (2π)2 h−2 E2
rest]1/2 . Similar expressions can be obtained for superlumi-
nal particles. In the early Universe, the characteristic phase transition temperature sclaes
[2 , 9] would be:

for the ordinary sector, kB being the Boltzmann constant, and:

(13)

(14)

for each superluminal sector. The cosmological phase transition temperatures depend, for
each sector, on the sectorial spring constant and not on the critical wavelength scale. An

interesting scenario would be, for all i : ai = a ; Ki ≫ K . Then, the ”Planck scale”
may still make sense as a distance scale, but the ”Planck temperature” (equivalent to a
Debye temperature) would be diﬀerent for diﬀerent sectors. Above T0 , only superluminal
particles would in principle exist and ”Cherenkov” radiation in vacuum may have been in-
hibited by the very short time scale. In this case, the Universe would have quickly cooled
down just after having reached each critical temperature (T0 and the Ti’s). Another pos-
sible scenario would be: ai ≫ a ; ci ≫ c which requires very large values of Ki but is
not prevented by any basic principle. In such case, a question arises: since superluminal
particles remain ”elementary” at scales where the internal structure of ordinary particles
(quarks, leptons, gauge bosons...) shows up, are the former part of the constituents of the
vacuum structure generating the latter? If the answer is positive for one of the superlumi-
nal sectors, transparency of vacuum with respect to superluminal particles of this sector
would not be a trivial problem. Superluminal particles raise several fundamental questions
concerning their origin and properties as possible components of vacuum dynamics.

1b. Further analogies

The analogy with solid state physics raises in itself two interesting questions:

i

- Do umklapp processes [12] take place at very high energy? In such processes, the
total momentum would be conserved only up to an integer multiple of h a−1 ~u for ordinary
particles, and of h a−1
~u for superluminal particles, where ~u is a unitary vector. This (or
a more involved scenario) cannot be excluded, as there is no guarantee that translation
invariance remains valid below the a and ai distance scales. Dynamics would then depend
crucially on the topology of momentum space. This topological space can be the product
of three circles like in a crystal lattice. But it can also be, for instance, a sphere with
antipodes identiﬁed on its surface (i.e. k0 ~u = − k0 ~u for any unitary vector ~u). Then,
rotation invariance would be preserved and expression (10) can naturally apply to three
space dimensions. We can also consider a momentum topology where all points on the
surface | ~u | = k0 of the momentum sphere would be identiﬁed to a single point (making
the momentum space topologically similar to the SU(2) group). Umklapp processes would
modify the thermal conductivity of the very early Universe, and make more diﬃcult heat
exchanges between diﬀerent regions of space at high temperature.

- Is the ”acoustic branch” [12] the only dynamical branch of ordinary or superluminal
particles? The question is not merely academic, as the contrary may imply the existence
of ”optical” particles with: a) negative inertial mass at zero momentum, but positive rest
energy; b) minimum energy at maximum momentum. Such particles would be very heavy
and, at high energy, undergo a repulsive acceleration in the presence of a static, attractive,
gravitational feld. They may have crucially inﬂuenced the expansion of the Universe.
”Optical” particles can be generated replacing in the previous analogy the monoatomic
lattice by a diatomic one. We would then be led in the vacuum rest frame, in a similar
way to [12] in one space dimension and assuming rotation invariance when generalizing
the ansatz to the three-dimensional case, to the frequency spectrum:

ω2 = K0 ± K1 (k)

(15)

5

with:

K0 = K + G + λ1 + λ2
K1 = [K 2 + G2 + 2 K G cos (ka) + (λ1 − λ2)2]1/2

(16)

(17)

where 2λ1 , 2λ2 are monoatomic elastic constants similar to ω2
rest in the previous example
and K , G govern nearest-ion interactions [12] . All these constants are positive in realistic
examples based on harmonic oscillators. The solution with the − sign (”acoustic” particles)
can be dealt with in a similar way to the monoatomic case, and leads to a massless particle
if λ1 = λ2 = 0 . Writing δ = λ1 − λ2 , the solution with a + sign (the ”optical
branch”) has rest (zero momentum) frequency:

Erest (optical) = (2π)−1 h [K0 + (K 2 + G2 + 2 K G + δ2)1/2]1/2

(18)

and negative values of d2ω/dk2 . In the limit where k approaches ±π a−1 , the energy
approaches the positive value:

Emin (optical) = (2π)−1 h [K0 + (K 2 + G2 − 2 K G + δ2)1/2]1/2

(19)

and the particle would also be at rest (zero speed) in this limit, where it has its minimum
possible energy and its maximum permitted momentum. Since this is the less energetic
state, it is likely that ”optical” particles tend to be in such a state in the present epoch.
There, for ~k = k0 ~u where ~u is an arbitrary unitary vector, they would have a large,
positive inertial mass in the direction of their momentum and inﬁnite inertial mass in
the two other directions. More precisely, we can write for an ”optical” particle around
maximum wavelength ~k = k0 ~u submitted to a static external force the hamiltonian:

H = (2π)−1 h [K0 + K1 (k)]1/2 + V (~r)

(20)

where ~r is the position vector and, with the relation ~k = 2π h−1 ~p where ~p is the
momentum, the classical Hamilton equations:

~v = 2π h−1 ~∇k H = − (a k−1/2) [K0 + K1 (k)]−1/2 sin (ka) ~k dK1/d[cos(ka)] (21)

d ~k/dt = − 2π h−1 ~∇ V (~r)

(22)

where ~∇k stands for gradient in wave vector space. For a unitary vector ~u :

d ~v/dt |~k = k0~u = − [2 Emin (optical)]−1 K G [K (k0)]−1 a2 [~u.~∇ V (~r)] ~u

(23)

Therefore, an ”optical” particle at minimum energy can be accelerated only by a force
parallel to its momentum. A condensate of ”optical” particles in vacuum may then sponta-
neously break rotation invariance, as ”optical” particle-antiparticle pairs would be at rest
with maximum momenta pointing, locally, in arbitrary directions. The observed isotropy of
cosmic microwave background radiation as well as our daily experience and the long range
of gravitational forces seem to indicate that such an eﬀect, as felt by ”acoustic” particles,
must be very small when observed at large distance scales. At shorter distance scales (e.g.
those reached by accelerator experiments), it may be worth to perform precision tests of
rotation invariance. The threshold for ”optical” particle production would be given by the

6

energy at maximum wave vector (we expect masses ≈ 1019 GeV c−2 for a ≈ 10−33 cm),
and not by the k = 0 rest energy as for ”acoustic” particles. Particles of the ”acoustic
branch” would be faster than those of the ”optical branch”, but their maximum energy
would be lower than the minimum energy of ”optical” particles. ”Optical” particles, or
instead more complicated objects, may indeed appear at very high energy as a consequence
of nontrivial vacuum structure. As they seem to be in ”one-to-one” correspondence with
”acoustic” particles, we consider them as being part of the same dynamical sector. The
question arises whether such ”optical” objects, whatever they are, can play a role in the
renormalization of quantum ﬁeld theories. In any case, it seems diﬃcult to imagine how
”bare” particles could reasonably be deﬁned without taking into account physics at the
natural cut-oﬀ scales where ”point-like” interactions do no longer make sense.

In principle, there is no basic reason for ”optical” particles to couple to the ”acoustic”
graviton in the same way as ”acoustic” particles. For instance, the low-momentum Lorentz
symmetry becomes euclidean and with a diﬀerent value of the critical speed. ”Optical”
particles correspond to fundamentally diﬀerent vacuum excitations and would not neces-
sarily decay into ”acoustic” ones. If such decays do not occur, some ”optical” particles
may be stable. Since they are in one-to-one correspondence with ”acoustic” particles,
”optical” particles can possibly couple to ”acoustic” internal-symmetry gauge bosons. If
ordinary particles are excitations of vacuum degrees of freedom associated to a condensate
of particles of the i-th superluminal sector and involving a long range superluminal force,
ordinary ”optical” particles at small wave vector may mix with the superluminal ﬁeld, in
the same way as optical phonons mix with the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a ionic crystal [12].
This would give rise to superluminal ”polaritons” propagating in vacuum.

If ”optical” particles have signiﬁcant couplings to ”acoustic” gravitation and internal-
Interactions
symmetry gauge bosons, several interesting phenomena can be expected.
between ”optical” and ”acoustic” particles would present rather unconventional features.
The low-energy hamiltonian for a system formed by an ”acoustic” particle of mass ma and
an ”optical” particle of eﬀective inertial mass MO will be in the vacuum rest frame:

H ≃ p2

a (2 ma)−1 + (2MO)−1 (2π a)−2 h2 sin2(ka) + V (~r)

(24)

where ~pa is the momentum of the ”acoustic” particle, ma its mass, MO the eﬀective inertial
mass of the ”optical” particle, ~k its wave vector, ~r = ~ra − ~rO , ~ra and ~rO the position
vectors of the ”acoustic” and the ”optical” particle, and V (~r) the potential energy. If the
”optical” particle is close to k = k0, we can write:

sin2 (k a) = sin2 (k a − k0 a) ≈ (k a − k0 a)2

H ≃ p2

a (2 ma)−1 + (2MO)−1 (pO − h a−1/2)2 + V (~r)

where ~pO is the momentum of the ”optical” particle, and Hamilton equations lead to:

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

dpO/dt = − dpa/dt = ~∇ V (~r)

~va = m−1

a ~pa

7

~vO = M −1

O (pO − h a−1/2) p−1

O ~pO

where ~va and ~pO stand for the velocity of the ”acoustic” and ”optical” particle. The last
equation can be turned into:

~pO = ~vO v−1

O (MO vO) + h a−1/2)

so that the conserved total momentum ~P is given by:

~P ≃ ma ~va + MO ~v + h a−1 v−1

O ~vO/2

(29)

(30)

(31)

It directly follows from this expression that, if the momentum transfer amounts only
to a rotation of ~pO , it will be mainly spent in the rotation of the zero-speed component
of the momentum of the ”optical” particle. Only a fraction ≃ 2 MO vO h−1 a would in
such case lead to a modiﬁcation the eﬀective momentum MO vO of the ”optical” particle.
In the limit where the ”optical” particle is initially at rest, there will be no acceleration
for a transverse inﬁnitesimal momentum transfer. Thus, naive conservation laws will not
apply to the ”eﬀective” total momentum ma ~va + MO ~vO .

”Optical” particles may be unconventional dark matter candidates playing an impor-
tant role in the formation of structure in the early Universe. As for ”acoustic” particles,
annihilation may have been prevented by matter-antimatter asymmetry. If such particles
exist, are stable and have not annihilated, they will be present in the matter-dominated
Universe. If their density is of the order of standard cosmological matter densities, and if
they are practically at rest with respect to the vacuum rest frame (assumed to be close
to that deﬁned by cosmic microwave background), they will move at a speed ≈ 2.10−3 c
with respect to the Local Group. We can then expect on earth ﬂuxes ≈ 10−6 m−2 year−1
which would not be unaccessible to future cosmic ray detectors. An interesting question
is whether they can be found in ”acoustic” matter. If they have a signiﬁcant cosmological
density, couple to ”acoustic” gravitation and have accreted with ”acoustic” matter, they
should be present in terrestrial materials. However, it should be noticed that the gravi-
tational force they would feel on the surface of earth is ≈ 1012 eV m−1 GO,a G−1
N for a
mass MO ≈ 10−5 gm (the mass scale suggested by the above considerations), GO,a being
the gravitational coupling constant between ”acoustic” and ”optical” particles, and GN
Newton’s constant. If GO,a G−1
N is not much below 1 , this force may have been strong
enough to favour the diﬀusion of ”optical” particles trough terrestrial matter towards the
center of the earth. Dedicated experiments could, for instance, search in ﬁne powders for
very heavy particles with unconventional responses to external forces.

1c. The low-energy limit

The above analogies remind simple, well-known examples of how dynamics at a small
scale of distance (the interatomic distance) with energy scale ≈ 1 keV (T ≈ 107 K)
can generate, and naturally protect, objects (the phonons) existing as massless excitations
down to microkelvin temperatures (≈ 10−10 eV ). A new dynamical interpretation of
massless particles and gauge interactions may potentially emerge from such analogies,
with inner vacuum dynamics replacing the standard geometric formulation of the gauge

8

principle and chiral symmetries. For instance, rather than associating gauge ﬁelds to a
mathematical way to compare local deﬁnitions of space-time or internal symmetry frames,
we can admit that there is a well-deﬁned physical way to make such comparisons but
that the local frames and parameters ﬂuctuate. Because of nearest-neighbour interactions,
ﬂuctuating dynamical links between sites are generated giving rise to the gauge bosons.
In the above simple-minded model of links, the masslessness of the gauge boson would
be equivalent to assuming that, whatever its value, no energy is spent in setting the
matrix u (n , n − 1) to be diﬀerent from the identity provided its value is the same
for all links. Gauge ﬁelds could possibly be interpreted as polarization states of vacuum
with nearest-neighbour interaction between polarizations (similar to spin systems). The
concept of ”vacuum polarization” already appeared long ago in quantum electrodynamics
without any explicit use of a precise vacuum structure [19 , 21] . With more than one
space dimension, since the local polarization variable would naturally be a vector, we can
associate it with links between sites but also with the sites themselves. In this last case,
the above u (n , n − 1) would rather become a space-vector U(N) matrix ~P (n) describing
the polarization state of each site on the lattice. The use of links or of site variables would
depend on the details of the dynamics and, possibly, on the scale at which the lattice is
built. More fundamental is the absence of local elastic constants, such as ωrest in (1) , in
order to preserve the masslessness of the gauge bosons.

Apart from gravitational lenses and similar experiments able to feel the eﬀect of dark
matter, all the above phenomena would remain invisible to low-energy experiments. For
instance, in the ordinary sector with h k ≈ 1 keV /c and a ≈ 10−33 cm , one has (k a)2 ≈
10−52 , which is clearly much too small to produce any detectable eﬀect. High-energy
experiments would be the only way to possibly reach sensitivity to this kind of Lorentz
symmetry violation. Thus, the impressive bounds derived from low-energy experimental
tests of Lorentz invariance (e.g. [24 , 25]) are not incompatible with the proposed scenario.
A basic question can be raised: can we still justify the existence of gravity as a gauge
interaction, if Lorentz invariance is just a low-energy limit? In the previous analogy, an
answer could be that local ﬂuctuations of the vacuum rest frame and of local dynamical
parameters exist in any case. For instance, if gµν is the eﬀective metric tensor in the low-
energy Lorentz-invariant limit of the equations of motion, a ﬂuctuation of the coeﬃcients of
the time derivative and of the nearest-neighbour interaction in (1) amounts to a ﬂuctuation
of the metric. More generally, we can consider (1) as a particular conﬁguration of the
equation:

A d2/dt2 [φ (n)] + H d/dt [ φ (n + 1) − φ (n − 1)] −

− Kf l [2 φ (n) − φ (n − 1) − φ (n + 1)] − ω2

rest φ = 0

(32)

In the continuum limit, the coeﬃcients A = g00 , H = g01 = g10 and −Kf l = g11
can be regarded as the matrix elements of a space-time bilinear metric with equilibrium
values: A = 1 , H = 0 and Kf l = K . Then, a small local ﬂuctuation:

A = 1 + γ

Kf l = K (1 − γ)

9

(33)

(34)

with γ ≪ 1 would be equivalent to a small, static gravitational ﬁeld created by a far away
source. The ”graviton” would remain massless if the local ﬂuctuations of A , Kf l and H ,
δA (n) , δKf l (n) and δH (n) , satisfy equations like (1) without the rest-frequency term
(as is the case for the vibrations of a crystal, where only nearest-neighbour interactions
play a role). Then, gravitation would still exist even if Lorentz symmetry is no longer an
exact linear symmetry. The graviton would lead to a long-range force, as long as global
ﬂuctuations of A , Kf l and H would cost no vibrational energy. No obvious incompatibility
seems to arise between this scenario and the violation of Lorentz symmetry at very high
energy, which is related to the ﬁnite value of a and, as we shall see in the next chapter,
can produce detectable eﬀects even at very small values of k a .

2. LORENTZ SYMMETRY VIOLATION IN HIGH-ENERGY PHYSICS

The study of high-energy phenomena must incorporate the fact that, if Lorentz in-
variance is broken, relativistics kinematics can no longer be applied. As an illustrative
example, we shall use the kinematics derived from the analogy with the one-dimensional
monoatomic Bravais lattice. But, obviously, our basic arguments have a more general
validity. Several consequences can follow from this modiﬁcation of the usual framework:

2a. The GZK cutoﬀ does no longer apply

Assume that, in the vacuum rest frame, the kinematics of ”ordinary” particles is indeed
given by (10) with universal values of K and a , and K 1/2 a = c . As an example, we
take a ≃ 10−33 cm and K ≃ 1087 s−2 . At the distance scales associated to the highest
cosmic ray energies, i.e. energy E ≈ 1020 eV and (k a)2 ≈ 10−17 , we can expand E as
follows:

E ≃ (2π)−1 h [K (k2a2 − k4 a4/12) + (2π)2 h−2 E2

rest]1/2

(35)

and, at high energy, we can write:

rest − k2 a2/24]

E ≃ (2π)−1 h c k [1 + 2π2 (h c k)−2 E2

(36)
Corrections from Lorentz symmetry breaking are thus of order 10−18 , i.e. ≈ 100 eV .
This is to be compared with the term from rest energy in (36) which, for a proton and at
the same energy, is ≈ 10−2 eV . Thus, Lorentz symmetry violation can play an important
role in kinematics at these energies. A proton with E > 1020 eV interacting with a cosmic
microwave background photon would be sensitive to these corrections. For instance, after
having absorbed a 10−3eV photon moving in the opposite direction, the proton gets an
extra 10−3eV energy, whereas its momentum is lowered by 10−3eV /c . In the conventional
scenario with exact Lorentz invariance, this is enough to allow the excited proton to decay
into a proton or a neutron plus a pion, losing an important part of its energy. However,
it can be checked that in our scenario with Lorentz invariance violation such a reaction is
strictly forbidden. Writing for the maximum allowed energy transfer the equation:

2π (h c)−1 [E (k + 2π.10−3 eV /hc) + 10−3 eV ] − k = δp + δπ

with

δp = (k − kπ) [2π2 h −2(k − kπ)−2 m2

pc2 − (k − kπ)2 a2/24]

(37)

(38)

10

δπ = kπ [2π2 (h kπ)−2 m2

π c2 − k2

π a2/24]

(39)

where mp and mπ are respectively the proton and the pion mass, kπ the momentum of the
produced pion, and the left-hand-side of the equation can be approximated by:
2π (h c)−1 [E (k + 2π.10−3 eV /hc) + 10−3 eV ] ≈ E (k) + 2.10−3 eV

(40)

it turns out that corrections due to Lorentz symmetry violation completely preclude the
reaction. Elastic p + γ scattering is permitted, but allows the proton to release only a
small amount of its energy, as can be seen writing:

2π (h c)−1 [E (k + 2π.10−3 eV /hc) + 10−3 eV ] − k = δp + δγ

(41)

γ a2/24

with δp deﬁned as before replacing kπ by the outgoing photon wave vector kγ and:
δγ = − k3

(42)
whose solution is in the range kγ ≈ 10−5 k . Thus, the outgoing photon energy for
an incoming 1020 eV proton cannot exceede ∆Emax ≈ 10−5 E = 1015 eV instead of
the value ∆Emax ≈ 1019 eV obtained with exact Lorentz invariance. Similar or more
stringent bounds exist for channels involving lepton production. Furthermore, obvious
phase space limitations will also lower the event rate, as compared to standard calculations
using exact Lorentz invariance which predict photoproduction of real pions at such cosmic
proton energies. The eﬀect seems strong enough to invalidate the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin
(GZK) cutoﬀ [26] and explain the existence of the highest-energy cosmic rays [27] . It will
become more important at higher energies, as we get closer to the a−1 wavelength scale.
Similar arguments apply to heavy nuclei, again invalidating the GZK cutoﬀ. Since, in both
cases, the cosmic ray energy was expected to degrade over distances ≈ 1024 m according to
conventional estimates, the correction by several orders of magnitude we just introduced
applies to distance scales much larger than the estimated size of the presently observable
Universe. It is not possible to extend the argument to photons of E ≈ 1014 eV , because
in this case one would have (k a)2 ≈ 10−29 leading to too small corrections.

Thus, compared to the model considered by Coleman and Glashow [15] , the present
scenario (where K and a have an exactly universal value for all ”ordinary” particles)
produces the reverse eﬀect. Not only the existence of very high-energy cosmic rays is
not an evidence against Lorentz symmetry violation, but the experimental failure of the
GZK cutoﬀ for protons and nuclei would be an evidence for a deviation from relativistic
kinematics. Obvioulsy, a better understanding of the dynamics at Planck scale is needed.

2b. Unstable high-momentum particles live longer than naively expected

In standard relativity, we can compute the lifetime of any unstable particle in its
rest frame and, with the help of a Lorentz transformation, obtain the Lorentz-contracted
lifetime for a particle moving at ﬁnite speed. This is no longer possible with the kinematics
deﬁned by (10). If a particle of mass m and momentum k decays into two particles (particles
1 and 2) with masses m1 and m2 , m > m1 + m2 , we can write at high energy, in the
energetically most favourable conﬁguration (no transverse energy):

E (k , m) = E (k′ , m1) + E (k − k′ , m2)

(43)

11

which, with a simple change of variables using (10) can be turned into:

[sin2 (θ/2) + α]1/2 = [sin2 (θ1/2) + α1]1/2 + [sin2 (θ2/2) + α2]1/2

(44)

where θ = k a , α = (π m c a)2 h−2 and similarly for θ1 , θ2 , α1 and α2 . Writing
for simplicity α1 = α2 and setting the conﬁguration θ1 = θ2 , (always allowed with
exact Lorentz invariance in which case it requires nonzero transverse energy), the equation
becomes:

sin2 (θ/2) + α = 4 [sin2 (θ1/2) + α1]

and, for θ1 = θ2/2 :

1 − cos (k a/2) = (α − 4 α1)1/2

and, for α , α1 and k a ≪ 1 , can be approximated by:

k ≃ 21/2 (π c)1/2 (a h)−1/2 (m2 − 4 m2

1)1/4

(45)

(46)

(47)

so that the conﬁguration is forbidden above this value of k . This implies an important
reduction of phase space for the decay of very high-energy particles: their lifetimes get
longer than it was expected with exact Lorentz invariance. More complicate expressions
6= m2 . If m1 and m2 are both nonzero, a
with similar meaning can be derived for m1
stronger constraint can be obtained which forbids the decay at very high energy. To derive
it, we can write: θ = θ1 + θ2 , and expand equation (44). We are thus led to:

α − α1 − α2 = 2 [sin2 (θ1/2) sin2 (θ2/2) + D (θ1, θ2, α1, α2)]

(48)

where:

D (θ1, θ2, α1, α2) = [sin2 (θ1/2) + α1]1/2 [sin2 (θ2/2) + α2]1/2 −

− sin (θ1/2) sin (θ2/2) cos (θ1/2) cos (θ2/2)

(49)

If m1 or m2 vanishes, it will always be possible to keep the left-hand side of (48) larger
than the right-hand side taking, for instance, m1 = 0 and sin (θ1/2) small enough
(although most of the usual phase space would then be lost). However, this possibility
does no longer exist if none of the two masses vanish. In general, any decay with at least
two massive particles being part of the ﬁnal state is forbidden at very high energy. We can
check the existence of such bounds minimizing the right-hand side in (48) . If m2 is the
smallest mass, a typical bound will forbid the decay for E > Est where:

Est ≈ c3/2 h1/2 (a m2)−1/2 (m2 − m2

1 − m2

2)1/2

(50)

Thus, as a result of Lorentz symmetry violation, unstable particles and nuclei may become
stable when accelerated to very high momenta, provided all decay channels contain at least
two massive particles. The energy scale above which the decay is forbidden varies like the
inverse square root of the mass of the lightest particle produced by the decay.

The neutron would become stable for E >∼ 1020 eV . At the same energies or slightly
above, some unstable nuclei would also become stable. Similarly, some hadronic resonances

12

(e.g. the ∆++ , whose decay product must contain at least a proton and a positron) would
become stable at E >∼ 1021 eV . Most of these objects will decay before they can be
accelerated to such energies, but they may result of a collision at very high energy or of
the decay of a superluminal particle. The study of very high-energy cosmic rays can thus
reveal as stable particles objects which would be unstable if produced at accelerators.

Neutrino masses and oscillations are also important in order to discuss the lifetimes
of high-energy particles, as we are often confronted to decay modes involving muon and
electron neutrinos. For instance, if one of the light neutrinos (νe , νµ) has a mass in the
≈ 10 eV range, the muon would become stable at energies above ≈ 1022 eV . Let E1 , E2 ,
m1 and m2 be the energies and masses of neutrinos ν1 and ν2 , which mix to give neutrinos
ν and ν′ with energies E , E′ and masses m , m′ . We write (10) as: E = F (k , m)
for neutrino ν , and similar expressions for the other neutrinos. A simple mixing scheme
would be to add to the hamiltonian non-diagonal elements:

< ν1 | H | ν2 > = < ν2 | H | ν1 > = ∆ (k)

(51)

and require that the hamiltonian has eigenvalues E and E′ given by the above described
expressions. We then get:

∆2 (k) = F (k , m1) F (k , m2) − F (k , m) F (k , m′)

and a mixing angle ψ given by:

tan (2 ψ) = 2 ∆(k) [F (k , m1) − F (k , m2)]−1

Going back to a more fundamental level, if φ1 and φ2 are two diﬀerent (but related)
degrees of freedom satisfying equation (1) and describing ν1 and ν2 with the same value of
K and diﬀerent values of ω2
rest , adding a term proportional to | φ1 − φ2 |2 to the lagrangian
would indeed result in a pure mass mixing of the type we just presented with constant ψ ,
without changing the eﬀective value of K (therefore leaving the critical speed in vacuum
unchanged). However, since Lorentz invariance does no longer hold, the form of the disper-
sion relation (10) may be modiﬁed at high wavelength by anharmonic eﬀects. Mixing with
superluminal particles would produce diﬀerent eﬀects, as it necessarily implies particles
associated to oscillations with diﬀerent values of K and cannot leave sectorial kinematics
unchanged. Such a mixing can strongly modify the parameters of our above discussion
(see also [11] for an explicit example), but in any case it contributes to invalidate the GZK
cutoﬀ and to possibly permit unstable particles to become stable at high momentum.

3. SUPERLUMINAL PARTICLES AND STANDARD COSMOLOGY

It is well known that, in the standard Big Bang model without inﬂation [17 , 18] ,
the horizon problem arises basically from the fact that the most distant sources we can
observe now with microwave antennae pointing in opposite directions must have been
≈ 100 horizon lengths apart when the cosmic microwave background radiation decoupled
(T , temperature, ≈ 3 . 103 K , t , age of the Universe, ≈ 1013 s). Given the observed
isotropy of cosmic background radiation, it seems diﬃcult to understand how regions of

(52)

(53)

13

the Universe that were not in causal contact could have acquired the same temperature
up to ≈ 10−5 ﬂuctuations. Temperature ﬂuctuations are related to density ﬂuctuations
which were in principle generated much earlier in the history of the Universe.

Superluminal particles may provide a natural alternative to inﬂation in order to solve
the horizon problem. For instance, assuming that the size of the presently observable
Universe is ≈ 1026 m and its age ≈ 1017s , and a standard evolution for R (the cosmological
distance scale measured by the radius of the presently observable Universe), we ﬁnd a ratio
R t−1 ≈ 104 c at cosmic time t ≈ 107 s and kB T ≈ 1 keV . A superluminal particle with
critical speed ci ≈ 1012 c and rest energy Erest = mc2
i ≈ 100 GeV (m ≈ 10−13 eV c−2)
in thermal equilibrium (i.e. with v ≈ 108 c) can cross the Universe provided it can keep
most of its energy for more than ≈ 107 s . The eﬀect of collisions has been taken into
account, assuming that the particle undergoes a few scatterings per second. This scenario
requires ”Cherenkov” radiation in vacuum to be very weak. At such energies, the emitted
ordinary particles woud necessarily be photons and neutrino-antineutrino pairs. Therefore,
the superluminal particle should have weak enough electroweak couplings. By traveling
at very high speed, such particles can emit pairs of ”back-to-back” ordinary photons and
neutrinos (see, e.g. [9 , 10]) or locally thermalize slower (therefore, heavier) superluminal
particles which in turn would thermalize ordinary matter. In this way, it may be possible to
solve the horizon problem and simultaneously ﬁnd dark matter candidates, if superluminal
particles are abundant enough to compensate the expected weak coupling between diﬀerent
sectors. More precise considerations would require building a global cosmological model,
of which we give some possible ingredients below.

To attempt a description of the cosmological role of superluminal particles, we assume
that a theory of all gravitation-like forces can be built, taking at each point the vacuum
rest frame, and generalize Friedmann equations writing for a ﬂat Universe in the present
epoch (where pressure can be neglected):

R−1 d2R/dt2 ≈ − 4π Z2 Z −1

1 /3 + Λ/3

(R−1 dR/dt)2 ≈ 8π Z2 Z −1

1 /3 + Λ/3

where Λ is the cosmological constant [17 , 18] and, in a simpliﬁed scheme:

Z1 = ρa + ρO + Σi (ρa,i + ρO,i)

Z2 = Ga ρ2

a + GO ρ2

O + Σi (Ga,i ρ2

a,i + GO,i ρ2

O,i)

where Ga = GN is Newton’s gravitational constant, ρa the density of ”acoustic” ordinary
matter, ρO the density of ”optical” ordinary matter (taken to be positive), ρa,i and ρO,i the
densities of ”acoustic” and ”optical” matter of the i-th superluminal sectors (again, taking
the densities of ”optical” particles to be positive), and the G’s are eﬀective gravitation-like
coupling constants. Z2 Z −1
replaces the usual expression GN ρ in standard Friedmann
1
equations. Z1 is the total density of ”particle matter”, where the expression ”particle
matter” designs all possible excitations of vacuum that we can describe as particles.

Expressions (54) to (57) can be derived, for instance, by associating standard Friedmann
equations (with only one ”gravitational” component) to a lagrangian in terms of R and

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

14

dR/dt , and generalizing the expressions for kinetic and potential energies in the limit
where gravitational couplings between diﬀerent components of Z1 are small. An interaction
between the diﬀerent ”gravitational” components of Z1 is, even in this case, implicitly
generated by the constraint that R and dR/dt are space-time variables common to all
the kinds of matter we consider. Since, at the same time, cosmology considers space-time
as being generated by matter, this is indeed an eﬀective dynamical interaction between
matter from diﬀerent sectors. The role of vacuum is crucial in the generation of a single,
absolute space-time with a local absolute rest frame.

The new formulae reﬂect the fact that the ”graviton” coupled to superluminal matter
is in principle not the same which couples to ”ordinary” matter (indeed, local ﬂuctuations
of the vacuum rest frame and dynamical constants can be sector-dependent), assume for
simplicity a similar separation between ”optical” and ”acoustic” matter inside the same
sector and, to a ﬁrst approximation, neglect eﬀects due to the mixing between the eﬀective
gravitons coupled to diﬀerent components. Modiﬁcations to this schematic description can
be readily introduced, but would not change our basic reasoning and conclusions concerning
the new ﬂexibility of cosmological ﬁts and the allowed values of the cosmological constant.
For instance, we can add to Z2 ”non-diagonal” terms due to gravitation-like interactions
between diﬀerent components of Z1 . Deﬁning, as usual [17 , 18], the critical density ρc as
the ”acoustic” ordinary matter density which, alone, would make the standard Friedmann
equations compatible with a ﬂat Universe without cosmological constant and with the
measured value of Hubble’s constant, i.e. ρc = 3 (8π GN )−1 H 2
0 where H0 is the current
value of R−1 dR/dt , we can write:

ΩΛ = (8π GN ρc)−1 Λ = (3 H 2
α (GN ρc Z1)−1 = (3 Z1 H 2

0 )−1 Λ
0 )−1 Gα ρ2
α

Ωα = Gα ρ2

(59)
α is one of the components of Z2 in (57) , i.e. α = a , O , (a , i) , (O , i) .

(58)

where Gα ρ2
We then get, for a ﬂat Universe, the relation:

Ω = ΩΛ + Σα Ωα = 1

(60)

In the recent years, there have been claims [28 , 29] in favour of a comparatively
large cosmological constant which could amount, using the above deﬁnitions of the Ω-
like parameters, to values of ΩΛ (the contribution of the cosmological constant to the
expansion of the Universe) as large as ≈ 0.6. The scenario we propose, with many
components of Z1 and Z2 , would allow for rather small values of Z2 Z −1
(typically, if
1
there are many components with similar weights and weakly interacting with eachother),
and therefore possibly for ΩΛ naturally close to 1 in a ﬂat Universe, even if ρa/ρc is equal
to 0.3 or larger. Thus, at the price of considerably weakening the connection between the
density of ordinary ”acoustic” matter and the parameters governing the expansion of a
ﬂat Universe but possibly getting closer to reality, the new formulation would really make
easier cosmological ﬁts willing to simultaneously describe matter in the Universe, galaxy
formation, the age of the Universe, and the spectrum and isotropy of cosmic microwave
background. If the Universe is not ﬂat, the following term accounting for cosmic curvature
should be added to the right-hand side of (55):
Zcurv = − kc R−2

1 Σα ρα c2

(61)

U Z −1

α

15

where kc = ± 1 is the curvature constant, RU the curvature radius of the Universe (most
likely, RU ≫ R) and cα the critical speed of each component of Z1 . From (54 - 57), the
formula for the deceleration parameter q [17 , 18] becomes:

q = − (R d2R/dt2) (dR/dt)−2 = H −2 (4π Z2 Z −1

1 − Λ)/3

(62)

where H = R−1 dR/dt is Hubble’s ”constant” and, writing:

− Zcurv = − H 2 + (8π Z2 Z −1

1 + Λ)/3 = H 2 (2 q − 1) + Λ

(63)

we generalize the well-known relation between curvature, deceleration and Hubble’s con-
stant [17 , 18] in the presence of a nonvanishing cosmological constant. Deﬁning Ω as
before, expression (60) applied to the present Universe becomes now:

Ω = ΩΛ + Σα Ωα = 1 − Zcurv H −2
0

= 1 + kc R−2

U H −2

0 Z −1

1 Σα ρα c2
α

(64)

or, eliminating Zcurv in terms of the present value of q , q0 :

Ωparticles = Σα Ωα = 2 (q0 + ΩΛ)

which is similar to standard formulae, but with the deﬁnitions (58) and (59). Whether the
Universe is ﬂat or curved, the equalities (64) and (65) lead to the standard relations:

ΩΛ = (1 − 2q0 − Zcurv H −2

0 )/3

Ωparticles = 2 (1 + q0 − Zcurv H −2

0 )/3

with Zcurv = 0 in a ﬂat Universe. The requirement that Ωparticles be positive, combined
with experimental bounds on q0 , puts bounds on a positive value of Zcurv (corresponding to
k = − 1). The situation seems less obvious for negative values of Zcurv , if superluminal
particles exist.
In recent ﬁts [28 , 29] , ΩΛ tends to get close to its maximum value
compatible with experimental lower bounds on q0 , and a negative Zcurv would allow for
a larger ΩΛ provided the contribution of superluminal sectors to Ωparticles is large enough.
In (54) and (55), the cosmological constant Λ is actually:

Λ = Z −1

1 Σα Λα ρα

(68)

where the Λα are sectorial cosmological constants, varying much slower than R . The
expansion of the Universe seems thus to generate the vacuum matter which produces the
sectorial cosmological constants. It is quite naturally that a signiﬁcant cosmological con-
stant would arise in our approach. If Z1 and Z2 describe the role of vacuum excitations, but
the expansion of the Universe is still generating the matter which forms the ground state
of vacuum (i.e. ”vacuum” itself), this evolution is expected to spend a sizeable amount of
energy in the creation of new matter: it must be driven by vacuum dynamics and vacuum
energy. Then, the presence in (54) and (55) of terms describing inner vacuum dynam-
ics seems compelling, even at a deeper level than for inﬂationary models. For instance,
vacuum may have two sets of degrees of freedom: a) one, presently at low temperature,
which produces all the objects that we call ”particles”; b) a second one at higher tem-
perature (possibly undergoing a second-order phase transition and weakly coupled to the

(65)

(66)

particles we observe), whose cooling generates vacuum matter and drives vacuum expan-
It is well kown, in condensed matter physics, that two weakly interacting sets of
sion.
degrees of freedom can remain for a long time at diﬀerent temperatures (e.g. in adiabatic
demagnetization). It is not obvious how well the simpliﬁed approach we adopted allows
to describe the possibly complex role of vacuum, as a dynamical system with many de-
grees of freedom, in the present expansion of the Universe. Most likely, in spite of the
important successes of present models [30 , 31] , crucial ingredients describing the role of
inner vacuum dynamics are still missing in standard cosmology. Current ”Pre-Big Bang”
cosmology [32] is based on a superstring approach where vacuum dynamics is accounted for
by the spectrum and properties of the complete set of vacuum excitations described by the
superstrings. Alternatives approaches could be directly based on inner vacuum dynamics,
naturally generating superluminal particles and Lorentz symmetry violation.

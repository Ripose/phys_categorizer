In this paper we have resolved the apparent paradox of diﬀerent mechanical
equations for force and torque governing the motion of a charged particle in
diﬀerent inertial frames. The same paradox arises in all usual “explanations” of
the Trouton-Noble experiment. It is shown that the real cause of the paradoxes
is - the use of three dimensional (3D) quantities, e.g., E, B, F, L, N, their
transformations and equations with them.
Instead of using 3D quantities we
deal with 4D geometric quantities, their Lorentz transformations and equations
with them. In such treatment the paradoxes do not appear. The explanation
with 4D geometric quantities is in a complete agreement with the principle of
relativity and with the Trouton-Noble experiment.

1. Introduction

In a recent paper Jackson [1] discussed the apparent paradox of diﬀerent me-
chanical equations for force and torque governing the motion of a charged par-
ticle in diﬀerent inertial frames. Two inertial frames S (the laboratory frame)
and S′ (the moving frame) are considered. S′ moves uniformly in the +x di-
rection with a speed V = cβ. A point charge Q is ﬁxed permanently at the
origin in S′. In S′ a particle of charge q and mass m experiences only the ra-
dially directed electric force caused by Q at the origin. At time t′ = 0 in S′
the particle of charge q is released at rest with r′(0) = r′
0, see ﬁgure 1(a) in
[1]. Such initial conditions give that the particle has no angular momentum; it
moves radially outward without torque. Thus both the angular momentum L′
and the torque N′ are zero in S′. (Vectors in the three dimensional (3D) space
will be designated in bold-face.) In the laboratory frame S the charge Q is in
uniform motion and it produces both an electric ﬁeld E and a magnetic ﬁeld B
that are given by equations (3a) and (3b) respectively in [1]. The existence of
the magnetic ﬁeld B in S is responsible for the existence of the 3D magnetic
force F = qV × B and this force provides a 3D torque on the charged particle
relative to the ﬁxed origin in the laboratory N = x × F, see ﬁgure 1(b) in [1].
Consequently a nonvanishing 3D angular momentum of the charged particle
changes in time in S, N = dL/dt. Here we repeat Jackson’s words [1] about
such result: “How can there be a torque and so a time rate of change of angular
momentum in one inertial frame, but no angular momentum and no torque in
another? Is there a paradox? Some experienced readers will see that there is no
paradox - that is just the way things are, ...” (my emphasis) Such reasoning is

1

considered to be correct by many physicists. However in the considered case the
principle of relativity is violated and the “explanation” of the type “that is just
the way things are” does not remove the violation of the principle of relativity
but only accept that violation as something natural. We consider that such an
explanation as in [1] is not natural and not relativistically correct; the paradox
remained completely untouched in the approach from [1]. (In the following the
paradox examined in [1] will be called Jackson’s paradox.)

In this paper it will be shown that - it is not the way things are, but that
there is a simple solution of the above problem which is in a complete accordance
with the principle of relativity. The real cause of the paradox is - the use of
3D quantities, e.g., E, B, F, L, N, their transformations and equations with
them. The 3D quantities are considered as physical, measurable quantities in
the 4D spacetime. Instead of using 3D quantities we shall deal from the outset
with 4D geometric quantities, their Lorentz transformations (LT) and equations
with them. In such treatment the paradox does not appear and the principle of
relativity is naturally satisﬁed. It is considered in our approach that in the 4D
spacetime the physical reality, both theoretically and experimentally, is attributed
only to the 4D geometric quantities.

The same paradox arises in all usual “explanations” of the Trouton-Noble
experiment. Here it will be shown that in the explanation with 4D geometric
quantities the Trouton-Noble paradox does not appear and such an explanation
is in a complete agreement with the principle of relativity and with experiments.
In section 2 the standard transformations of the 3D E and B are quoted.
In sections 3-5 diﬀerent 4D geometric quantities are introduced and discussed
using geometric algebra formalism. This includes the bivector ﬁeld F , section 3,
the 4D electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B (1-vectors) and the relations that
connect F with E and B, section 4, then the 4D Lorentz force KL (1-vector),
the angular momentum M (bivector) and the torque N (bivector), section 5.
In section 6 we have presented the Lorentz transformations of the 4D E and
B and of other multivectors. In section 7 the standard transformations of the
electric and magnetic ﬁeld are derived and it is shown that they diﬀer from
the Lorentz transformations of the 4D E and B. The most important sections
are sections 8-8.4 and 9.2. The resolution of Jackson’s paradox is presented in
four diﬀerent ways in sections 8-8.4 using 4D geometric quantities. In the same
way the resolution of the Trouton-Noble paradox is given in section 9.2. Finally
section 10 refers to conclusions.

2. Standard transformations of the 3D E and B

Both E and B given by (3a) and (3b) in [1] can be also obtained using the
relations that connect the 3D E and B in relatively moving inertial frames. In
general they are given by equation (11.149) from [2], which we repeat here

E′ = γ(E + β×cB) − (γ2/γ + 1)β(β · E)
B′ = γ(B + β × E/c)−(γ
/γ+1)β(β · B).

The inverse transformations are found by interchanging primed and unprimed
quantities and putting β → −β. The transformations (1) are derived by Lorentz
[3], Einstein [4], and it seems that according to [5] and [6] Poincar´e was the ﬁrst
who gave a mathematically valid derivation of the transformations of the 3D
E and B, see two fundamental Poincar´e’s papers with notes by Logunov [6].
According to such relations, e.g., the electric ﬁeld E in one inertial frame is
expressed by the mixture of E′ and B′ from relatively moving inertial frame.
They are considered by almost all physicists to be the LT of the 3D E and B, but
for the reasons explained below, we shall call them the standard transformations
(ST), while the name LT will be reserved for the LT of the 4D quantities.
In our case the relations (1), when written in components, become

Ex = E′
Bx = B′

x, Ey = γ(E′

Denoting the event of the release of the particle as A we write its coordinates

A = yA, z′
A = 0 than also
tA = 0. With such an assumption the relations (3) become equations (3a) and
(3b) in [1] but, in fact, it is not correct in this case to take that tA = 0 as
well. Namely the event of the coincidence of the origins of S′ and S, let it be
O = 0, 0, 0, 0) in S′ and O(tO = 0, 0, 0, 0) in S. Thus
O, has the coordinates O(t′
the events O and A are simultaneous in S′, t′
A = 0 and they cannot be
simultaneous at the same time in S, i.e., tA must be 6= 0. However we are not
interesting in it since only what is important here is the appearance of Bz 6= 0 in
S. This leads to dL/dt and N diﬀerent from zero in S and thus to the violation
of the principle of relativity in the laboratory frame S.

O = t′

3. The electromagnetic ﬁeld F

Now consider the same problem using geometric 4D quantities. This investi-
gation will be done in the geometric algebra formalism which is presented in
[7-11]. Physical quantities will be represented by geometric 4D quantities, mul-
tivectors that are deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., as absolute quantities
(AQs) or, when some basis has been introduced, they are represented as 4D

3

coordinate-based geometric quantities (CBGQs) comprising both components
and a basis. Usually [7-11] one introduces the standard basis. The generators
of the spacetime algebra are taken to be four basis vectors {γµ} , µ = 0, ...3 (the
standard basis) satisfying γµ · γν = ηµν = diag(+ − −−). This basis is a right-
handed orthonormal frame of vectors in the Minkowski spacetime M 4 with γ0
in the forward light cone. The γk (k = 1, 2, 3) are spacelike vectors. The basis
vectors γµ generate by multiplication a complete basis for the spacetime algebra:
1, γµ, γµ ∧ γν, γµγ5,γ5 (16 independent elements). γ5 is the pseudoscalar for the
frame {γµ}, γ5 = γ0 ∧ γ1 ∧ γ2 ∧ γ3.

It is worth noting that the standard basis corresponds, in fact, to the speciﬁc
system of coordinates that we call Einstein’s system of coordinates. In Einstein’s
system of coordinates the standard, i.e.,Einstein’s synchronization [4] of distant
clocks and Cartesian space coordinates xi are used in the chosen inertial frame.
However diﬀerent systems of coordinates of an inertial frame are allowed and
they are all equivalent in the description of physical phenomena. For example,
in [12,13] and in the second and the third paper in [14], two very diﬀerent, but
physically completely equivalent systems of coordinates, Einstein’s system of
coordinates and the system of coordinates with a nonstandard synchronization,
the everyday (radio) (“r”) synchronization, are exposed and exploited through-
out the paper. For the sake of brevity and of clearness of the whole exposition,
we shall mainly work with the standard basis {γµ}, but remembering that the
approach with 4D quantities that are deﬁned without reference frames holds for
any choice of basis.

Note that our living arena is the 4D spacetime in which, according to our
opinion, physical reality, both theoretically and experimentally, is attributed
only to geometric 4D quantities, AQs or CBGQs, and to physical laws expressed
by such geometric 4D quantities. When physical laws are written with 4D AQs
or 4D CBGQs then there is no room for the preference of any synchronization,
standard or nonstandard, or, better to say, of any system of coordinates even in
an inertial frame. This is examined in a geometric approach to special relativity
(SR), i.e., the invariant SR, which is developed in [12-19] and compared with
experiments in [14] and [17-19]. (The name invariant SR comes from the fact
that such geometric approach to SR exclusively deals with AQs or with the
corresponding CBGQs and every CBGQ is invariant upon the passive LT; the
components transform by the LT and the basis by the inverse LT leaving the
whole CBGQ unchanged. This will be explained in section 6.)
In addition
we remark that the usual covariant formalism does not work with geometric
quantities but only with components (numbers) taken usually in the {γµ} basis;
the basis is only implicit not explicit in the covariant formalism.

Although we shall utilize the geometric algebra formalism in a manner very
similar to that one in the above mentioned references [7-11], our results in the
electromagnetic ﬁeld theory markedly diﬀer from all previous results including
[1-11]. These results are already published in the tensor formalism [12,13,16]
(with tensors as AQs or equivalently as CBGQs) and also presented as e-prints
[15], [17-19] both in tensor and geometric algebra formalisms.
(In [12] and
again in [13] it is found in a manifestly covariant way that there is, contrary to

4

the generally accepted opinion, a second-order electric ﬁeld outside stationary
superconductor with steady current.) It is important to note that these new
results are completely in agreement with the principle of relativity and with ex-
periments that test SR as can be clearly seen, e.g., from [17-19] and particularly
[14].

First let us write the bivector ﬁeld F (x) (or, we shall also call it the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld F (x)) for a charge Q with constant velocity uQ (1-vector), see,
e.g., [10] equation (7.94) or [11] equation (26), or the discussion in [19] section
IV.B,

F (x) = kQ(x ∧ (uQ/c))/ |x ∧ (uQ/c)|3 .

In (4) F (x) is written as an AQ, i.e., it is deﬁned without reference frames. For
the charge Q at rest, uQ/c = γ0, whence

F(0)(x) = kQ(x ∧ γ0)/ |x ∧ γ0|3 .

(4)

(5)

All AQs in equations (4) and (5) can be written as CBGQs in some basis.
We shall write them in the standard basis {γµ}. In the {γµ} basis x = xµγµ,
uQ = uµ
Qγµ, F = (1/2)F αβγα ∧ γβ (the basis components F αβ are determined
as F αβ = γβ · (γα · F ) = (γβ ∧ γα) · F ).

4. The relations that connect F with 4D E and B

From the given F one can construct electric and magnetic ﬁelds represented
by diﬀerent algebraic objects, e.g., 1-vectors or bivectors. Instead of using the
spacetime split and the bivectors (relative vectors and relative bivectors) for the
representation of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds as in [7-11], we shall make an
analogy with the tensor formalism [20] and represent the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds by 1-vectors E and B that are deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., as
AQs. Such representation with 1-vectors E and B and their real and complex
combination is examined in, e.g., [15] and also in [17-19]. (The formulations
of the classical electromagnetism in terms of the 4-vectors (components not
geometric quantities) of the electric Eα and magnetic Bα ﬁelds are presented in
[21-23] in the usual covariant tensor formalism. In [23] the relativistically correct
deﬁnition of the electromagnetic 4-momentum with Eα and Bα is presented
and used to resolve the famous “4/3” factor appearing in the problem of the
electromagnetic mass of the classical electron.) The electric and magnetic ﬁelds
deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., independent of the chosen reference frame
and of the chosen system of coordinates in it, thus as AQs, are given as

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v
E = (1/c)F · v, B = −(1/c2)I(F ∧ v)

(6)

where I is the unit pseudoscalar. (I is deﬁned algebraically without introduc-
ing any reference frame, as in [24], section 1.2.) The velocity v and all other
quantities entering into the relations (6) are AQs. That velocity v characterizes

5

some general observer. We can say, as in tensor formalism [20], that v is the
velocity (1-vector) of a family of observers who measures E and B ﬁelds. Of
course the relations for E and B, equations (6), are coordinate-free relations
and thus they hold for any observer. The relations (6) are manifestly Lorentz
invariant equations. Note that E · v = B · v = 0, which yields that only three
components of E and three components of B are independent quantities.

E and B from (6) can be written as CBGQs in the {γµ} basis and they are

E = Eµγµ = (1/c)F µνvν γµ
B = Bµγµ = −(1/2c2)εαβνµFαβvν γµ

where εαβνµ is the totally skew-symmetric Levi-Civita pseudotensor, ε0123 = 1.
When some reference frame is chosen and the standard basis {γµ} in it and
when v is speciﬁed to be in the time direction in that frame, i.e., v = cγ0 (the γ0
- system), which means that the observers who measure the ﬁelds are at rest in
that frame, then results of the classical electromagnetism are recovered in that
γ0 - system. Notice that we can select a particular, but otherwise arbitrary,
inertial frame of reference as the γ0 - system, to which we shall refer as the
frame of our “ﬁducial” observers (for this name see [21]). In the γ0 - system
equation (6) becomes

F = Ef ∧ γ0 + (γ5Bf ) · γ0
Ef = F · γ0, Bf = −(1/c)γ5(F ∧ γ0)

where in the {γµ} basis the pseudoscalar I from (6) is γ5, I = γ5. The subscript
“f ” in the above relations (8) stands for “ﬁducial” and denotes the explicit
dependence of these quantities on the γ0 - observer, i.e., “ﬁducial” - observer.
It can be seen that in the γ0 - system Ef and Bf do not have the temporal
components E0
f = 0. Namely in the γ0 - system with the {γµ} basis Ef
and Bf , written as CBGQs, are

f = B0

Ef = Eµ
Bf = Bµ

f γµ = 0γ0 + F i0γi
f γµ = 0γ0 + (−1/2c)ε0kliFklγi.

Thus Ef and Bf actually refer to the 3D subspace orthogonal to the speciﬁc
timelike direction γ0. It is seen from (9) that the components of Ef and Bf in
the {γµ} basis are

Ei

f = F i0, Bi

f = (−1/2c)ε0kliFkl.

The relation (10) is nothing else than the standard identiﬁcation of the com-
ponents F µν with the components of the 3D vectors E and B, see, e.g., [2]
equation (11.137) and the relations (8) and (9) are, in fact, the spacetime split
as in [7-10].

In Hestenes’ decomposition of F , e.g., [9] equations (58)-(60), the bivector
ﬁeld F is expressed in terms of the sum of a relative vector EH and a relative

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

6

bivector γ5BH by making a spacetime split in the γ0 - system

F = EH + cγ5BH , EH = (F · γ0)γ0

BH = −(1/c)γ5(F ∧ γ0)γ0.

(11)

where the subscript H is for “Hestenes.” Both EH and BH are, in fact, bivec-
tors. These relations, in the same way as the relations (8), are not manifestly
Lorentz invariant equations; they are observer dependent relations. The ex-
plicit appearance of γ0 in these expressions implies that the spacetime split is
observer dependent and thus all quantities obtained by the spacetime split in
the γ0 - system are observer dependent quantities. The diﬀerence between our
approach and Hestenes’ one in electromagnetism is that Hestenes deals from the
outset with the spacetime split and the decomposition (11), while we start with
Lorentz invariant decomposition (6) and introduce the spacetime split specifying
the general velocity v to be equal cγ0.

This suggests that the relations (11) can also be made manifestly Lorentz
invariant equations, as are the equations (6), by replacing cγ0, the velocity of
observers at rest, with some general velocity v. Then the obtained equations
are

F = EHv + cIBHv EHv = (1/c2)(F · v) ∧ v

BHv = −(1/c3)I[(F ∧ v) · v].

(12)

(The subscript Hv is for “Hestenes” with v and not, as usual [7-10], with γ0.)
Now the relations (12) completely correspond to the equations (6). The relations
(12) were ﬁrst presented in [17, 18]. However, it is worth noting that it is much
simpler and, in fact, closer to the classical formulation of electromagnetism with
the 3D E and B to work with the decomposition of F into 1-vectors E and B,
as in (6), or in the γ0 - system in (8), instead of decomposing F into bivectors
EHv and BHv (12), or in the γ0 - system in (11). Thence we proceed using only
the decomposition of F into 1-vectors E and B (6), or (8).

5. KL, M , N as 4D AQs or 4D CBGQs

All quantities that appear in the problem discussed by Jackson [1] can be writ-
ten as 4D AQs and equations with them will be manifestly Lorentz invariant
equations. Thus the position 1-vector in the 4D spacetime is x. Then x = x(τ )
determines the history of a particle with proper time τ and proper velocity
u = dx/dτ . The Lorentz force as a 4D AQ (1-vector) is KL = (q/c)F · u, where
u is the velocity 1-vector of a charge q (it is deﬁned to be the tangent to its
world line). In the usual geometric algebra approaches [7-10] to SR one makes
from the outset the spacetime split and writes the Lorentz force KL (1-vector)
in the Pauli algebra of γ0. Since this procedure is observer dependent we express
KL in terms of AQs 1-vectors E and B as

KL = (q/c)F · u = (q/c) [(1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v] · u

(13)

7

see also [15,17]. (Of course the whole consideration could be equivalently made
using EHv and BHv from (12) but with more complicated expressions.) The
equivalent expression in the tensor formalism, with tensors as AQs, is given,
e.g., in [20], by Vanzella, Matsas and Crater. In the general case when charge
and observer have distinct worldlines the Lorentz force KL (13) can be written
as a sum of the v− ⊥ part KL⊥ and the v− k part KLk, KL = KL⊥ + KLk,
where

KL⊥ = (q/c2)(v · u)E + (q/c)((IB) · v) · u

KLk = (−q/c2)(E · u)v

respectively. Of course KL, KL⊥ and KLk are all 4D quantities deﬁned without
reference frames, the AQs, and the decomposition of KL into KL⊥ and KLk is an
observer independent decomposition. It can be easily veriﬁed that KL⊥ · v = 0
and KLk ∧ v = 0. Particularly from the deﬁnition of the Lorentz force KL =
(q/c)F · u and the relation E = (1/c)F · v (from (6)) it follows that the Lorentz
force ascribed by an observer comoving with a charge, u = v, is purely electric
KL = qE.

Both parts of KL can be written as CBGQs in the standard basis {γµ}

KL⊥ = (q/c2)(vν uν)Eµγµ + (q/c)

νρuνBργµ

εµ
e

where
induced on the hypersurface orthogonal to v and

εµνρ ≡ ελµνρvλ is the totally skew-symmetric Levi-Civita pseudotensor
e

KLk = (−q/c2)(Eν uν)vµγµ.

Speaking in terms of the prerelativistic notions one can say that in the approach
with the 1-vectors E and B K⊥ plays the role of the usual Lorentz force lying
on the 3D hypersurface orthogonal to v, while Kk is related to the work done
by the ﬁeld on the charge. However in our invariant SR only both components
together, equations (14) and (15), have physical meaning and they deﬁne the
Lorentz force both in the theory and in experiments.

Further the angular momentum M (bivector), the torque N (bivector) about
the origin for some force K (1-vector) and manifestly Lorentz invariant equation
connecting M and N are deﬁned as

M = x ∧ p, p = mu,
N = x ∧ K; N = dM/dτ

where for the Lorentz force KL the torque N about the origin becomes N =
x ∧ KL.

When M and N (for the Lorentz force KL) are written as CBGQs in the

{γµ} basis they become

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

M = (1/2)M µνγµ ∧ γν, M µν = m(xµuν − xν uµ),
N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν, N µν = xµK ν

L − xνK µ

We see that the components M µν (M αβ = γβ · (γα · M )) from (19) are identi-
cal to the covariant angular momentum four-tensor given by equation (A3) in
Jackson’s paper [1]. However M and N from (18) are geometric 4D quantities,
the AQs, which are independent of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen
system of coordinates in it, whereas the components M µν and N µν that are used
in the usual covariant approach, e.g., equation (A3) in [1], are coordinate quan-
tities, the numbers obtained in the speciﬁc system of coordinates, Einstein’s
system of coordinates, i.e., in the {γµ} basis. Notice that, in contrast to the
usual covariant approach, M and N from (19) are also geometric 4D quantities,
the CBGQs, which contain both components and a basis, here bivector basis
γµ ∧ γν .

It is worth noting that the principle of relativity is automatically included
in such a theory with geometric 4D quantities, AQs or CBGQs, whereas in the
standard approach to SR [4] the principle of relativity is postulated outside the
framework of a mathematical formulation of the theory.

6. The LT of 4D E and B and of other multivectors

In the usual Cliﬀord algebra formalism [7-11] the LT are considered as ac-
tive transformations acting on multivectors as AQs. When AQs are written
as CBGQs in some basis then the components of, e.g., some 1-vector relative
to a given inertial frame of reference (with the standard basis {γµ}) are trans-
formed by the active LT into the components of a new 1-vector relative to the
same frame (the basis {γµ} is not changed). Furthermore the LT are described
R = 1, in the usual way as p → p′ = Rp
µγµ
with rotors R, R
e
when the {γµ} basis is introduced. To an observer in the {γµ} basis the vector
p′ appears the same as the vector p appears to an observer in the (cid:8)γ′
µ(cid:9) basis.
(Reversion is an invariant kind of conjugation, which is deﬁned by
A,
B
e
e
a = a for any vector a, and it reverses the order of vectors in any given expres-
e
sion.) But every rotor in spacetime can be written in terms of a bivector as
R = eθ/2. For boosts in arbitrary direction

R and it is = p′
e

AB =
g

R = eθ/2 = (1 + γ − γβγ0n)/(2(1 + γ))1/2,

(20)

θ = αγ0n, β is the scalar velocity in units of c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2, or in terms of
an ‘angle’ α we have tanh α = β, cosh α = γ, sinh α = βγ, and n is not the basis
vector but any unit space-like vector orthogonal to γ0; eθ = cosh α + γ0n sinh α.
One can also express the relationship between the two relatively moving frames
S and S′ in terms of rotor as γ′
R. For boosts in the direction γ1 the rotor
R is given by the relation (20) with γ1 replacing n (all in the standard basis
{γµ}). Then for any multivector M the active LT are deﬁned by the relation

µ = Rγµ e

When the active LT (21) are applied to 1-vectors Ef and Bf from Eq. (9)

Actually, as we said, this is the way in which every 1-vector transforms upon
the active LT. The LT of the 4D E and B in the tensor formalism are already
presented in [16] and in geometric algebra formalism in [17, 18].

The same results can be obtained with the passive LT, either by using a
coordinate-free form of the LT (such one as in [12,13,15]), or by using the stan-
dard expressions for the matrix of the LT in the Einstein system of coordinates
from, e.g., [2], see also the discussion about passive and active LT in Hestenes’
paper [9] and equations (93) - (95) therein. The passive LT always transform
the whole 4D quantity, basis and components, leaving the whole 4D quantity
unchanged. Thus under the passive LT the ﬁeld bivector F as a well-deﬁned
µ ∧ γ′
4D quantity remains unchanged, i.e., F = (1/2)F µνγµ ∧ γν = (1/2)F ′µνγ′
ν
(all primed quantities are the Lorentz transforms of the unprimed ones).
In
the same way it holds that, e.g., Eµ
µ. The invariance of some 4D
CBGQ upon the passive LT reﬂects the fact that such mathematical, invari-
ant, geometric 4D quantity represents the same physical object for relatively
moving observers. Thus in the invariant SR we consider that quantity which
does not change upon the passive LT has an independent physical reality, both
theoretically and experimentally.

f γµ = E′µ

The importance of the concept of sameness of a physical system for diﬀerent
observers is ﬁrst emphasized in papers by Rohrlich [25] and Gamba [26] and fur-
ther developed and clariﬁed in, e.g., [12-14], where it is proved that the Lorentz

10

contraction and the dilatation of time belong to the “apparent” transformations
and not to the “true” transformations. The “apparent” transformations do not
refer to the same quantity in the 4D spacetime but to the same measurements,
whereas the “true” transformations, as are the LT, refer to the same 4D quan-
tity. For example, as explained in [12-14], in the Lorentz contraction the rest
spatial length L0 of a rod in its rest frame S and the spatial length L′ of that
rod in relatively moving inertial frame S′ do not refer to the same 4D tensor
quantity but to two diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime. These quantities are
obtained by the same measurements in S and S′; the spatial ends of the rod
are measured simultaneously at some t = a in S and also at some t′ = b in
S′, and a in S and b in S′ are not related by the LT or any other coordinate
transformation; see ﬁgure 3 in [13] and compare it with ﬁgure 1 in [13] for the
correct 4D geometric quantity, the spacetime length for a moving rod. The
names “apparent” and “true” transformations are introduced in Rohrlich’s pa-
per [25]. The comparisons [14] with well-known experiments that test SR as
are the Michelson-Morley experiment, the ”muon” experiments, the Kennedy-
Thorndike type experiments and the Ives-Stilwell type experiments explicitly
show that all these experiments are in a complete agreement with the geometric
approach of the invariant SR, whereas, contrary to the general belief, it is not
the case for the usual approach that deals with the “apparent” transformations,
the Lorentz contraction and the dilatation of time.

7. The derivation of the ST of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds

Let us now see how the ST (1) or (2) are obtained in a rigorous mathematical
way from the geometric approach to SR, .i.e., in the invariant SR. The ST for
E′
st (the subscript st is for standard) are derived assuming that the
quantities obtained by the active LT of Ef and Bf are again in the 3D subspace
of the γ0 - observer. Thus

st and B′

(i’) it is supposed that for the transformed E′

st and B′

st again hold that

E′0

st = B′0

st = 0, i.e., that E′

st · γ0 = B′

st · γ0 = 0 as for Ef and Bf .

Thence, in contrast to the LT of Ef and Bf , (22) and (23) respectively, it is

assumed in all Cliﬀord algebra formalisms, e.g., [7-11], that

The ST of, e.g., Ef , are given by (24) and this relation shows that only F is
transformed while γ0 is not transformed. This is the fundamental diﬀerence be-
tween the LT (22) and (23) and the ST (24) and (25). From the transformations

which is the relation (10) with the primed quantities. As can be seen from
equations (24), (25) and (26) the transformations for E′i
st. are the ST
of components of the 3D vectors E and B, equation (2) (and for the 3D E
and B, equation (1)), which are quoted in almost every textbook and paper on
relativistic electrodynamics including [3-5], see, e.g. Jackson’s book [2] section
11.10. These relations (24), (25) and (26) are explicitly derived and given in the
Cliﬀord algebra formalism, e.g., in [7] equation (18.22), [8] chapter 9 equations
(3.51a,b), [10] equation (7.33) and in [11] chapter 7 equations (20a,b). Notice
that, in contrast to the active LT (22) and (23),

st.

In all previous treatments of SR the transformations for E′i

st. are
considered to be the LT of the 3D electric and magnetic ﬁelds. However our
analysis shows that the transformations for E′i
st., equation (26), are
derived from the transformations (24) and (25), which diﬀer from the LT; the
LT are given by the relations (22) and (23).

What is with the concept of sameness when the ST (24) and (25), i.e., (1)
or (2), are used. It can be easily shown that Eµ
µ. This means that,
e.g., Eµ
µ are not the same quantity for observers in S and S′,
and that the ST are also the “apparent” transformations. As far as relativity is
f γµ and E′µ
concerned the quantities, e.g., Eµ
µ, are not related to one another.
The fact that they are measured by two observers (γ0 - and γ′
0 - observers) does
not mean that relativity has something to do with the problem. The reason is
that observers in the γ0 - system and in the γ′
0 - system are not looking at the
same 4D physical object but at two diﬀerent 4D objects. Every observer makes
measurement on its own object and such measurements are not related by the
LT. Thus the transformations for E′i
st., (24), (25) and (26) or (1) and
(2), are not the same as the LT of well-deﬁned 4D quantities, (22) and (23). (All
these results are presented in the tensor formalism in [16] and in the geometric
algebra formalism in [17-19], where they are also compared with experiments.)
The knowledge of this fundamental diﬀerence between the ST and the LT
enables us to resolve in a simple way Jackson’s paradox [1] that there is a torque
and so a time rate of change of angular momentum in one inertial frame, but
no angular momentum and no torque in another.

st. and B′i

8. The resolution of the paradox

First let us formulate the problem using AQs. The torque N about the origin
as an AQ is N = x ∧ KL, where KL is the Lorentz force given by (13) or
(14) and (15). E and B for a charge Q moving with constant velocity uQ can

12

be determined from (6) and the expression for the electromagnetic ﬁeld F (4).
They are

E = (D/c2)[(uQ · v)x − (x · v)uQ]
B = (−D/c3)I(x ∧ uQ ∧ v),

(27)

where D = kQ/ |x ∧ (uQ/c)|3 and, as before, k = 1/4πε0. (The relation (27) is
already derived in [19].) All these quantities are AQs, i.e., they are independent
of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it.
When the world lines of the observer and the charge Q coincide, uQ = v, then
(27) yields that B = 0 and only an electric ﬁeld (Coulomb ﬁeld) remains.

The next step is to write all AQs as CBGQs in some conveniently chosen
inertial frame with an appropriate basis in it. The main advantage of such
geometric approach is that when CBGQs are determined in a chosen inertial
frame they remain unchanged in all other relatively moving inertial frames and
they are independent of the chosen system of coordinates in these frames.

In our case one choice for the starting, convenient, frame is the S′ frame,
in which a point charge Q is ﬁxed permanently at the origin (uQ = cγ′
0), and
in that frame let the observers who measure the ﬁelds are at rest, i.e., in S′,
0 in (27). Thus the S′ frame is the frame of our “ﬁducial” observers or
v = cγ′
the γ0 - system in which results of the classical electromagnetism with the 3D
E and B are recovered. However in contrast to the classical electromagnetism
we are not concerned with the 3D E and B than by the 4D E and B, which
have only spatial components in the frame of “ﬁducial” observers. (Notice that,
as already said, the results do not depend on our choice for the γ0 - system.)
Further in S′ we choose Einstein’s system of coordinates, that is, the {γµ} basis.
ν = 0 in S′ then due to
When we show that the torque N = (1/2)N
the invariance of any CBGQ upon the passive LT N will be zero in all other
relatively moving inertial frames, thus in the laboratory frame, the S frame, as
well,

The paradox does not appear since the principle of relativity is automatically
satisﬁed in such an approach to SR which exclusively deals with geometric 4D
quantities, i.e., AQs or CBGQs.

8.1. The proof that all N

µν are zero in S′. N ′µν = x′µK ′ν

L −
Now let us show that all components N
x′ν K ′µ
L . The components x′µ are as in section 2 but we write them without
the subscript “A,” x′µ = (ct′ = 0, x′1, x′2, 0). The components of the Lorentz
force KL are determined from the relations (16) for KL⊥ and (17) for KLk.
The electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B respectively, are determined from
the relation (27) taking into account that in S′ v = cγ′
0, which yields that their
temporal components are zero in S′ (as in (9)). (The S′ frame is the frame of
“ﬁducial” observers.) Further in S′ uQ = cγ′
0 as well, which, from (27), yields,

13

µ = 0. (Notice that due to
as already said, that the whole B = 0; B = B
invariance of any CBGQ upon the passive LT the magnetic ﬁeld Bµγµ = 0 in
the laboratory frame S too.) The electric ﬁeld is

′

µγ′

E = E′µγ′

µ = D(x′1γ′

1 + x′2γ′

2),

(29)

where D = kQ/r′3. Of course, the spatial components of E are the same as the
A = 0) from section 2 as it must. In S′ the velocity 1-vector
components of E′(t′
of the charge q (at t′ = 0) is u = cγ′
0; in S′ both charges
Q and q are at rest. This yields that in KL, which is purely electric, KLk = 0
and KL⊥ = q(E′1γ′

0, i.e., u = v(= uQ) = cγ′

2). Thus it holds that

1 + E′2γ′

KL = KL⊥ = qE = qE′µγ′
µ

(30)

and it is = qEµγµ in S. Then the torque N becomes

N = (x′1K ′2

L )(γ′

1 ∧ γ′

2) = qD(x′1x′2 − x′2x′1)(γ′

1 ∧ γ′

2) = 0.

(31)

Taking into account the relations (28) and (31) we conclude that there is no
violation of the principle of relativity and consequently the paradox does not
appear in our approach with geometric 4D quantities.

8.2. The proof that N µν = 0 in S using the LT of KL and x

Although the relations (28) and (31) complete the proof that the torque N is
zero in all relatively moving inertial frames if it is zero in any one of them we
shall, for readers’ convenience, explicitly show that the torque N is zero in the
laboratory frame, the S frame, if it is zero in the S′ frame. This can be shown
in diﬀerent ways.

One way is to explicitly show that all N µν = 0 when N

µν = 0 using directly
Lγµ and xµγµ. The components of N in the S

fact, the whole CBGQs x′µγ′
L γ′
µ are transformed by the passive LT
from S′ to S, and it holds that x = x′µγ′
µ = xµγµ and similarly for KL. Then
it is easy to see that all components N µν are zero except N 02 = (−N 20) =
γβ(x′1K ′2
L ), but due to
(31) they are also zero, whence it follows that all N µν = 0 and consequently
N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν = 0.

8.3. The proof that N µν = 0 in S using the LT of E and B. The frame

14

µ and B′µγ′

Another way is, e.g., to use the passive LT corresponding to the active ones (22)
for the transformations of CBGQs E′µγ′
µ to Eµγµ and Bµγµ. We
suppose, as above, that the observers who measure the ﬁelds are at rest in S′,
0, thus v′µ = (c, 0, 0, 0) in S′. (It is already mentioned that with this
i.e., v = cγ′
µ is given by (29) and all B′µ are
choice u = v(= uQ) = cγ′
zero, i.e., B = B′µγ′
µ = 0. The CBGQs Eµγµ and Bµγµ in S are determined
by the passive LT of ﬁelds (corresponding to the active LT (22)), whence the
components in S are

0.) The CBGQ E′µγ′

Eµ = (γβE′1, γE′1, E′2, 0), Bµ = 0.

(33)

Notice that in S there is a temporal component E0 = γβE′1 and there is no
magnetic ﬁeld in relatively moving inertial frame S if it was zero in the frame
of “ﬁducial” observers, here the S′ frame. This is, as already mentioned, a fun-
damental diﬀerence relative to the ST (24) and (25), i.e., (1) or (2). Remember
that upon the passive LT the unit 1-vectors γ′
µ transform to γµ and it holds
µ = Eµγµ (the same quantity for observers in S′ and S) and also
that E = E′µγ′
B = B′µγ′
µ = Bµγµ = 0. When KL is written as a CBGQ in S and in the {γµ}
basis it is given as the sum of (16) and (17)

KL = (q/c2)[(vν uν)Eµ +

εµ
e
Now comes an important point. The CBGQs vµγµ and uµγµ in S are also
determined by the passive LT from those in S′; the observers who were at rest
in S′, the “ﬁducial” observers, are now moving in S, and the charge q is also
moving in S. Thence in S the components are

νρuνcBρ − (Eν uν)vµ]γµ.

(34)

vµ(= uµ) = (γc, γβc, 0, 0)

(for the whole CBGQ it again holds v = v′µγ′
Equation (35) together with (34) leads to

µ = vµγµ and the same for u).

L = q(1 − γ2)E0 + qβγ2E1,
L = q(1 + β2γ2)E1 − qβγ2E0,
L = qE2, K 3

L = qE3.

It is worth noting that the magnetic ﬁeld B does not appear in the Lorentz force.
Such result for B is obtained not only in S′, the frame of “ﬁducial” observers,
but in the laboratory frame S as well. Using the LT of Eµ (33) we get

K 0

L = qβγE′1, K 1

L = qγE′1, K 2

L = qE′2, K 3

L = qE′3 = 0.

(37)

Then it can be seen that only N 02 = x0K 2
L − x2K 1
L
remain. However they are also zero N 02 = qβγ(x′1E′2 − x′2E′1) = 0 and
N 12 = qγ(x′1E′2 − x′2E′1) = 0, since E′1,2 = Dx′1,2. Once again it is obtained
that N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν = 0.

L and N 12 = x1K 2

L − x2K 0

Of course if instead of using the passive LT of E and B (corresponding to
(22)) we deal with the ST (2), i.e., (24), then the 3D magnetic ﬁeld will appear

15

in the Lorentz force in the S frame. This will cause that in S the 3D torque
will be diﬀerent from zero and the principle of relativity will be violated.

8.4. The proof that N µν = 0 in S using the expressions (27) for E

and B. The frame of “ﬁducial” observers is the S frame

Let us now assume that the laboratory frame S is the frame of “ﬁducial” ob-
servers (v = cγ0, vµ = (c, 0, 0, 0) in S) in which the temporal components of
In the
the 4D E and B are zero and only their spatial components remain.
laboratory frame S both charges Q and q are moving and the components in
the CBGQs uµ

Qγµ and uµγµ are given as

uµ
Q = uµ = (γc, γβc, 0, 0).

(38)

The ﬁelds E and B as AQs are given by (27) and when they are written as
CBGQs in S then v = cγ0 and the components of uQ are determined by (38).
The components Eµ become E0 = E3 = 0, E1 = Dγ(x1 − βx0), E2 = Dγx2.
Taking into account that in S′ t′ = 0, i.e., x′0 = γ(x0 − βx1) = 0, the relation
x0 = βx1 is obtained. Inserting this last relations into expressions for Eµ we
ﬁnd

E0 = E3 = 0, E1 = Dx1/γ, E2 = Dγx2.

(39)

The charge Q moves in the S frame (now it is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers),
which yields that the magnetic ﬁeld B = Bµγµ is now diﬀerent from zero. The
components Bµ are

B0 = B1 = B2 = 0, B3 = (1/c)Dγβx2 = βE2/c.

(40)

The spatial components Ei and Bi from (39) and (40) are the same as the usual
expressions for the components of the 3D vectors E and B. Inserting (39) and
(40) into (34) we ﬁnd the expression for the Lorentz force KL in the laboratory
frame S. The components of KL in S are

Lk = qγβE1, K i
K 0
L⊥ = qγE1, K 2
K 1

Lk = 0, K 0
L⊥ = K 3
L⊥ = qγ(E2 − βcB3) = qE2/γ.

L⊥ = 0,

We see that in the laboratory frame S, when it is the frame of “ﬁducial” ob-
servers, there is the 4D magnetic ﬁeld (40) which enters into the expression for
the total 4D Lorentz force KL. Then using (39), (40), (41) and the relation
x0 = βx1 one easily ﬁnds all components N µν

x3 = 0, K 3
L = βK 1
K 0
L = qγ(E2 − βcB3) = qE2/γ ⇒ N 02 = N 12 = 0.
K 2

L = 0 ⇒ N 03 = N 13 = N 23 = 0,
L ⇒ N 01 = x1(βK 1

L − K 0

L) = 0,

(41)

(42)

Thus although in S there is the 4D magnetic ﬁeld (40) and a part of KL (in
K 2
L in (41)), which corresponds to the magnetic force, it is again obtained that

16

all components N µν are zero, N µν = 0, and consequently N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧
γν = 0. This proof is very instructive since it nicely clariﬁes the fundamental
diﬀerence between the usual approaches with 3D quantities and our approach
with 4D geometric quantities. In the usual approaches the 3D magnetic ﬁeld B
(which arises from the ST (1) of the 3D E′) yields the 3D magnetic force qV × B
and this causes that the 3D torque N is diﬀerent from zero in the laboratory
frame S. On the other hand when geometric 4D quantities are used then the
4D torque N is zero despite of the fact that in S the charge Q, which is moving
in S, produces both the 4D E and B (given by equation (27)). The conclusion
that can be drawn from this proof is that the real cause of the violation of the
principle of relativity and of Jackson’s paradox is the use of 3D quantities as
physical quantities in the 4D spacetime.

We see that always the same result (28) is obtained. This consideration
explicitly shows the consistency of the approach with geometric 4D quantities.
In addition the proofs from sections 8.1-8.3 once again reveal that the relativis-
tically correct transformations of the 4D electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which are
in a complete agreement with the principle of relativity, are the LT (22) and
(23) and not, as generally believed, the ST (24), (25) and (26) or (1) and (2).

9. Comparison with the Trouton-Noble experiment

The main diﬀerence between our geometric approach to the considered problem
and the approach in Jackson’s paper [1] is that in the geometric approach the in-
dependent physical reality is attributed only to the geometric 4D quantities, AQs
or CBGQs, and not, as usual, to the 3D quantities. In [1] even the covariant
quantities, e.g., M µν, xµ, uν, F αβ, etc. are considered as auxiliary mathemat-
ical quantities from which “physical” 3D quantities are deduced. However the
considerations in the preceding sections and in [12-19] show that the geomet-
ric approach is, as already said, in a complete agreement with the principle of
relativity and with experiments, see [14] and [16-18].

In this section we shall discuss the Trouton-Noble experiment [27], see also
[28], comparing the usual explanations with our geometric approach that explic-
itly uses AQs or CBGQs. In the experiment they looked for the turning motion
of a charged parallel plate capacitor suspended at rest in the frame of the earth
in order to measure the earth’s motion through the ether. The explanations,
which are given until now (see, e.g., [29-33] and references therein) for the null
result of the experiments [27] ([28]) are not correct from the invariant SR view-
point, since they use quantities and transformations that are not well-deﬁned in
the 4D spacetime; e.g., the Lorentz contraction, the nonelectromagnetic forces
of undeﬁned nature, the ST for the 3D E and B (1) (or (24), (25) and (26)) and
for the 3D torque, etc.. In all previous treatments it is found that there is no
3D torque N for the stationary capacitor since there is only a 3D electric force
qE in the rest frame of the capacitor. However, a 3D torque is always obtained
for the moving capacitor that is caused by the 3D magnetic force qV × B; the
existence of a 3D magnetic ﬁeld B in that frame comes from the transformations

17

(1). Everything happens in the same way as in the above discussed Jackson’s
paradox. Then, in order to get the agreement with experiments (and with the
principle of relativity), diﬀerent explanations are oﬀered for the existence of
another 3D torque, which is equal in magnitude but of opposite direction giv-
ing that the total 3D torque is zero. In our approach the explanation for the
null result is very simple and natural; all quantities are invariant 4D quantities,
which means that their values are the same in the rest frame of the capacitor
and in the moving frame. Thus if there is no torque (but now as a geometric,
invariant, 4D quantity) in the rest frame then the capacitor cannot appear to
be rotating in a uniformly moving frame. This explanation is the same as that
one for Jackson’s paradox which is presented in sections 8-8.4.

We shall not discuss previous explanations given in [29-32] but only the
recent “resolution” presented in [33]. It is argued there that the Trouton-Noble
paradox is resolved once the electromagnetic momentum of the moving capacitor
is properly taken into account. First it is obtained that there is a 3D mechanical
torque on the moving capacitor, due to the 3D magnetic force, and then it is
shown that the rate of change of the 3D angular electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum
associated with the moving capacitor completely balances the 3D mechanical
torque.The consideration with 4D quantities and their LT will reveal that there
is no need either for the nonelectromagnetic forces and their torque, [29-32], or
for the angular electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum and its rate of change, i.e., its
torque [33]. Therefore we shall examine in more detail the calculation of the 3D
torque that is presented in [33], but we do not need to consider the calculation
of the 3D angular electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum. (It is worth noting that the
resolution of the the Trouton-Noble paradox using geometric 4D quantities is
already presented in [19], but there we dealt with the electromagnetic ﬁeld F .)

9.1. Jeﬁmenko’s calculation [33] of the 3D torque

First let us discuss Jeﬁmenko’s calculation [33] of the 3D torque. The rest frame
of a thin parallel-plate capacitor is the S′ frame. In the S frame the capacitor
moves with uniform 3D velocity V in the positive direction of the x1 - axis.
(ﬁgure 1 from [33] is actually a projection onto the hypersurface t′ = const.,
which means that x, y and Θ from that ﬁgure 1 would need to be denoted as
x′1, x′2 and Θ′ respectively.) In the S′ frame A denotes the surface area of
the capacitor’s plates, a is the distance between the capacitor’s plates and Θ′
is the angle between the line joining the axis of rotation (i.e., the middle of the
negative plate) with the middle of the positive plate and the x′2 axis. That line
is taken to be in the x′1, x′2 plane. The uniform surface charge density on the
capacitor’s plates is σ. In the S′ frame there is only a 3D electric force and, in
the same way as in Jackson’s paradox with two charges, the 3D torque on the
stationary capacitor is zero N′ = r′ × F′ = 0; the total 3D force F′ and r′ are
along the same line. In components N′ becomes

i′ and j′ are unit 3D vectors in the direction of the x′ - and y′ - axis, respec-
tively and q is the total charge residing on the positive plate.) In equations
(43)-(46) the components of the 3D vectors N′, r′ and F′ are written with
lowered (generic) subscripts, since they are not the spatial components of 4D
quantities. This refers to the third-rank antisymmetric ε tensor too. The super-
and subscripts are used only on components of 4D quantities. Then in [33] the
3D torque experienced by the moving capacitor is determined by using “rela-
tivistic” (my quotation-marks) transformation equations for the torque. These
“relativistic” transformation equations for the 3D torque given in [33] are

where β = V /c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2. Equations (47) are equations (1)-(3) in [33].
The transformations (47) of the 3D N are found, e.g., in Jeﬁmenko’s book
[34]. In section 8 in [34], under the title: “From relativistic electromagnetism to
relativistic mechanics,” the transformations of diﬀerent 3D quantities are pre-
sented. Among others in section 8-6 in [34] the transformations of a 3D torque
are presented. Jeﬁmenko [34], as all others, considers that the transformations
(47) are the LT, but we shall call them the ST of the 3D N (in analogy with the
ST of the 3D E and B (1) or (2)) since they are not the LT of 4D quantities.
The same name, the ST, will be used for the transformations of all other 3D
quantities, e.g., the usual transformations of components of the 3D angular mo-
mentum L that are given by equation (11) in [1], then the transformations of the
3D force F that are given by equations (8-5.1)-(8-5.3) in [34], or by equations
(1.56)-(1.58) in [35], then the well-known transformations of the 3D velocity V
given, e.g., by equations (11.31) in [2], or equations (7-2.5)-(7-2.7) in [34], etc.
All mentioned transformations of the 3D quantities are, in fact, the “apparent”
transformations that are discussed in section 6.

Now let us proceed with the derivation of the 3D torque from [33]. Taking
3 = 0 Jeﬁmenko

into account in the ST of the 3D N (47) that N ′
[33] ﬁnds that N3 component is diﬀerent from zero

This result is commented in [33] in the following way: “We have thus obtained
a paradoxical result: contrary to the relativity principle, although our stationary
capacitor experiences no torque, the same capacitor moving with uniform veloc-
ity along a straight line appears to experience a torque. What makes this result
especially surprising is that we have arrived at it by using relativistic transfor-
mations that are based on the very same relativity principle with which they now
appear to conﬂict.” (my emphasis) Thus again the same paradox arises with
the violation of the principle of relativity as in the above discussed Jackson’s
paradox. It is assumed in [33], as in many other papers including [29-32], that
the transformations (47)) are the relativistic transformations, i.e., the LT, that
are based on the principle of relativity. Such opinion implicitly supposes that
3D quantities, their transformations and physical laws written in terms of them
are physically real in the 4D spacetime and in agreement with the principle of
relativity. Actually such opinion prevails already from Einstein’s fundamental
work on SR [4].

9.2. Resolution of the Trouton-Noble paradox in the invariant SR

The approach of the invariant SR [12-19] is completely diﬀerent. There, as
already explained, the physical reality in the 4D spacetime is attributed only
to geometric 4D quantities, AQs or CBGQs, their LT and physical laws written
in terms of them. The principle of relativity is automatically included in such
formulation.

Thence in the 4D spacetime we are dealing with the Lorentz force K =
(q/c)F · u, where u is the velocity 1-vector of a charge q. The torque N , as a
4D AQ, is deﬁned as a bivector

N = r ∧ K, r = xP − xO,

(49)

where r is 1-vector associated with the lever arm, xP and xO are the position 1-
vectors associated with the spatial point of the axis of rotation and the spatial
point of application of the force K, P and O are the events whose position
1-vectors are xP and xO.

In general, as in (18), the proper velocity u for a point particle is u = dx/dτ ,
τ is the proper time, p is the proper momentum p = mu, the proper angular
momentum of a particle is the bivector M = x ∧ p and the torque N about
the origin is the bivector N = dM/dτ = x ∧ K, where in this relation K is
an arbitrary force 1-vector. When K is written as a CBGQ in the standard
basis {γµ} then its components are K µ = (γuFiUi/c, γuF1, γuF2, γuF3), and
the components of u in the {γµ} basis are uµ = (γuc, γuU1, γuU2, γuU3). γu =
(1 − U 2/c2)−1/2, Fi are components of the 3D force F and Ui are components
of the 3D velocity U. We see that only when the considered particle is at rest,
i.e., Ui = 0, γu = 1 and consequently uµ = (c, 0, 0, 0), then K µ contains only
the components Fi, i.e., K µ = (0, F1, F2, F3). However even in that case uµ and
K µ are the components of geometric 4D quantities u and K in the {γµ} basis

20

and not the components of some 3D quantities U and F. The LT correctly
transform the whole 4D quantity, which means that there is no physical sense
in such transformations like (47); these transformations are not relativistic and
they are not based on the principle of relativity. All conclusions derived from
such relations as are equations (47) have nothing in common with SR as the
theory of the 4D spacetime.

After this digression we go back to the resolution of the Trouton-Noble para-
dox in the invariant SR. Since we have the same problem as in the above dis-
cussed Jackson’s paradox we could use any of the proofs from sections 8.1 -
8.4, but, for simplicity, we shall consider only the proof from section 8.1. As in
section 8.1 the S′ frame is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers and it is the rest
frame of the capacitor. In that frame we choose that r′0 = x′0
O = 0. The
system of coordinates is chosen in such a way that r′3 = 0 (as in ﬁgure 1 in
2, 0), where r′i are the same as in (44)
1, r′
[33]) giving that r′ = r′µγ′
(remember the convention about lowered (generic) subscripts for 3D quantities
that is mentioned in connection with equation (43)). Further, for the same rea-
sons as in section 8.1, we have that K ′µ = (0, F ′
2, 0), where K ′1 and K ′2 are
the same as in (46), i.e.,

µ, r′µ = (0, r′

P − x′0

1, F ′

K ′ = (σA)(E′1γ′

1 + E′2γ′

2) = C(r′1γ′

1 + r′2γ′

2).

This yields that N ′i0 = N ′13 = N ′23 = 0 and only remains N ′12 = r′1K ′2 −
r′2K ′1, which, taking into account (50), becomes

N ′12 = C(r′1r′2 − r′2r′1) = 0.

(50)

(51)

Thus all N ′αβ are zero in the S′ frame in which the capacitor is at rest. Since
the CBGQ (1/2)N ′µνγ′
ν is an invariant quantity upon the passive LT we
have proved, as in section 8.1, that not only the components N ′αβ are zero but
at the same time that the whole torque N is zero

µ ∧ γ′

N = (1/2)N ′µνγ′

µ ∧ γ′

ν = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν = 0.

(52)

Thence the torque is zero not only for the stationary capacitor but for the
moving capacitor as well. We see that in the approach with geometric 4D
quantities there is no Trouton-Noble paradox, as there is no Jackson’s paradox.

10. Conclusions

In both considered paradoxes there is a 3D torque and so a time rate of change of
3D angular momentum in one inertial frame, but no 3D angular momentum and
no 3D torque in another. The principle of relativity is violated and also there is
no agreement with the Trouton-Noble experiment. In all usual approaches the
3D magnetic ﬁeld B arises from the ST (1) of the 3D E′. This B ﬁeld determines
the 3D magnetic force qV × B and this causes that the 3D torque N is diﬀerent
from zero in the laboratory frame S, where the charges are moving. However

21

the proofs from sections 8.1-8.4 and 9.2 reveal that the relativistically correct
transformations of the 4D electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which are in a complete
agreement with the principle of relativity, are the LT (22) and (23) and not, as
generally believed, the ST (24), (25) and (26) or (1) and (2). In our geometric
approach, i.e., in the invariant SR [12-19], the independent physical reality in
the 4D spacetime is attributed only to geometric 4D quantities, AQs or CBGQs,
their LT and physical laws written in terms of them and not, as usual, to the
3D quantities. When geometric 4D quantities are used then it is consistently
obtained in diﬀerent manners that the 4D torque N is always zero, see sections
8.1-8.4 and 9.2. The principle of relativity is automatically satisﬁed with such
quantities and there is not either Jackson’s paradox or the Trouton-Noble para-
dox. The main conclusion that can be drawn from the whole consideration in
this paper is that the relativistically correct description of physical phenomena
can be achieved with geometric 4D quantities as physical quantities in the 4D
spacetime and not, as usual, with 3D quantities. This conclusion is in a full
agreement with all other results obtained in [12-19] and [23].

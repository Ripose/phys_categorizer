Possible Orientation Eﬀects to the Phase Diagram of
Fundamental Composite Particles

Abstract

We obtain possibly valuable information about the phase diagram of rather dense com-
posite particles at high fermion as well as boson number density but low temperature, which
is not accessible to relativistic heavy ion collision experiments. Our calculations could quali-
tatively measure the number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom at the time at which the
matter (produced in heavy ion collisions which might be a deconﬁned quark-gluon plasma)
comes into approximate local thermal equilibrium and begins to behave like a hydrodynamic
ﬂuid. Possible observational signatures associated with the theoretically proposed states of
matter inside compact stars are discussed as well.

1 Introduction

The only place in the universe where we expect suﬃciently high densities and low temperatures

is compact stars, also known as ’neutron stars’, since it is often assumed that they are made pri-

marily of neutrons (for a recent review, see [1]). A compact star is produced in a supernova. As

the outer layers of the star are blown oﬀ into space, the core collapses into a very dense object.

Neutron stars are among the most fascinating bodies in our Universe. They contain over a solar
10 km at densities of the order of 1015 g/cc. They probe the
properties of cold matter at extremely high densities and have proven to be fantastic test bodies

mass of matter within a radius of

∼

for theories of general relativity. In a broader perspective, neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions

provide access to the phase diagram of matter at extreme densities and temperatures, which is

basic for understanding the very early Universe and several other astrophysical phenomena.

Astrophysicists distinguish between three diﬀerent kinds of compact stars. These are white

dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. The former contain matter in one of the densest forms

found in the Universe which, together with the unprecedented progress in observational as-

tronomy, makes such stars superb astrophysical laboratories for a broad range of most striking

physical phenomena. These range from nuclear processes on the stellar surface to processes

in electron degenerate matter at subnuclear densities to boson condensates and the existence

of new states of baryonic matter such as color superconducting quark matter at supernuclear

densities. More than that, according to the strange matter hypothesis strange quark matter

could be more stable than nuclear matter, in which case neutron stars should be largely com-

posed of pure quark matter possibly enveloped in thin nuclear crusts. Neutron stars and white

dwarfs are in hydrostatic equilibrium, so at each point inside the star gravity is balanced by the

degenerate particle pressure, as described mathematically by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoﬀ

equation [2].

It is often stressed that there has never been a more exciting time in the overlapping areas

of nuclear physics, particle physics, and relativistic astrophysics than today [3]. This comes

at a time where new orbiting observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope, Rossi X-ray

Timing Explorer (RXTE), Chandra X-ray satellite, and X-ray Multi Mirror Mission (XMM)

have extended our vision tremendously, allowing us to see vistas with an unprecedented clarity

and angular resolution that previously were only imagined, enabling astrophysicists for the ﬁrst

time ever to perform detailed studies of large samples of galactic and extragalactic objects. On

the Earth, radio telescopes (e.g., Arecibo, Green Bank, Parkes, VLA) and instruments using

adaptive optics and other revolutionary techniques have exceeded previous expectations of what

can be accomplished from the ground. The gravitational wave detectors LIGO, LISA, VIRGO,

and Geo-600 are opening up a window for the detection of gravitational waves emitted from

compact stellar objects such as neutron stars and black holes.

Neutron stars are dense, neutron-packed remnants of massive stars that blew apart in super-

nova explosions [1]. They are typically about twenty kilometers across and spin rapidly, often

making several hundred rotations per second. Many neutron stars form radio pulsars, emitting

radio waves that appear from the Earth to pulse on and oﬀ like a lighthouse beacon as the star

rotates at very high speeds. Neutron stars in X-ray binaries accrete material from a companion

star and ﬂare to life with a burst of X-rays. Measurements of radio pulsars and neutron stars

in X-ray binaries comprise most of the neutron star observations. Improved data on isolated

neutron stars (e.g. RX J1856.5-3754, PSR 0205+6449) are now becoming available, and fu-

ture investigations at gravitational wave observatories such as LIGO and VIRGO will focus on

neutron stars as major potential sources of gravitational waves. Depending on star mass and

rotational frequency, gravity compresses the matter in the core regions of pulsars up to more

than ten times the density of ordinary atomic nuclei, thus providing a high pressure environment

in which numerous subatomic particle processes compete with each other.

The most spectacular ones stretch from the generation of hyperons and baryon resonances to

quark deconﬁnement to the formation of boson condensates. There are theoretical suggestions

of even more exotic processes inside neutron stars, such as the formation of absolutely sta-

ble strange quark matter, a conﬁguration of matter more stable than the most stable atomic
nucleus, 62Ni. Instead these objects should be named nucleon stars, since relatively isospin sym-
metric nuclear matter-in equilibrium with condensed K − mesons-may prevail in their interiors
[3], hyperon stars if hyperons (Σ,Λ,Ξ, possibly in equilibrium with the ∆ resonance) become

populated in addition to the nucleons, quark hybrid stars if the highly compressed matter in the

centers of neutron stars were to transform into u, d, s quark matter, or strange stars if strange

quark matter were to be more stable than nuclear matter. Of course, at present one does not

know from experiment at what density the expected phase transition to quark matter occurs.

Neither do lattice Quantum ChromoDynamical (QCD) simulations provide a conclusive guide

∼

1fm, nuclei begin to touch each other at densities of

yet. From simple geometrical considerations it follows that, for a characteristic nucleon radius
0.24 fm3, which
of rN
is less than twice the baryon number density of ordinary nuclear matter, ρ0 = 0.16 fm3 (energy
density ǫ0 = 140 MeV/fm3). Depending on the rotational frequency and stellar mass, such
densities are easily surpassed in the cores of neutron stars so gravity may have broken up the

neutrons (n) and protons (p) in the centers of neutron stars into their constituents. The phase

diagram of quark matter, expected to be in a color superconducting phase, is very complex [3,4].

At asymptotic densities the ground state of QCD with a vanishing strange quark mass is the

color-ﬂavor locked (CFL) phase. This phase is electrically charge neutral without any need for

electrons for a signiﬁcant range of chemical potentials and strange quark masses.

An intriguing aspect of quantum mechanics is that even at absolute zero temperature quantum

ﬂuctuations prevail in a system, whereas all thermal ﬂuctuations are frozen out. These quantum

ﬂuctuations are able to induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-

body system, when the ratio of two competing terms in the underlying Hamiltonian is varied

across a critical value [5]. The instability of the quantum critical behavior with respect to (w.r.t.)

the disorder can be interpreted as a signal for phenomena of localization. One example is the

strongly-interacting electron (non-Fermi) liquid with diﬀerent strengths of disorder. Interesting

issues are the quantum phase transition (QPT) and quantum critical point (QCP).
Quite recently McLaughlin et al.

[6] searched for radio sources that vary on much shorter

timescales. They found eleven objects characterized by single, dispersed bursts having dura-

tions between 2 and 30 ms. The average time intervals between bursts range from 4 min to

3 h with radio emission typically detectable for < 1 s per day. From an analysis of the burst

arrival times, they have identiﬁed periodicities in the range 0.4-7 s for ten of the eleven sources,

suggesting origins in rotating neutron stars. Meanwhile as all pulsars from which giant pulses

have been detected appear to have high values of magnetic ﬁeld strength at their light cylinder
105 G
[6], this value ranges from only 3 to 30G for these sources, suggesting that the bursts originate

radii [7]. While the Crab pulsar has a magnetic ﬁeld strength at the light cylinder of 9.3

×

from a diﬀerent emission mechanism. They therefore concluded that these sources represent a

previously unknown population of bursting neutron stars, which they call rotating radio tran-

sients (RRATs). These interesting new observations make us to investigate the rotation (e.g.,

it is still controversial how much angular momentum the iron cores have before the onset of the

gravitational-collapse) [1,6] as well as Pauli-blocking eﬀects [8] in compact stars considering the

phase diagram [4].

In present approach the Uehling-Uhlenbeck collision term [9-10] which could describe the collision

of a gas of dilute hard-sphere Fermi- or Bose-particles by tuning a parameter γ : a Pauli-blocking

factor (or γf with f being a normalized (continuous) distribution function giving the number of

particles per cell) is adopted together with a free-orientation θ (which is related to the relative

direction of scattering of particles w.r.t. to the normal of the propagating plane-wave front)

into the quantum discrete kinetic model [10] which can be used to obtain dispersion relations

of plane (sound) waves propagating in diﬀerent-statistic gases (of particles). We then study the

critical behavior based on the acoustical analog [12] which has been veriﬁed before. The possible

phase diagram (as the temperature is changed) related to the eﬀective number of thermodynamic

degrees of freedom (which is useful in QCD thermodynamics, it is one observable whose value

changes by more than an order of magnitude across the crossover transition from hadron gas to

quark-gluon plasma (QGP)[11]) we obtained resemble qualitatively those proposed before.

3 Numerical Results and Discussions

We ﬁrstly introduce the concept of acoustical analog [12] in brief. In a mesoscopic system, where

the sample size is smaller than the mean free path for an elastic scattering, it is satisfactory

for a one-electron model to solve the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation :

V (~r)]ψ = 0, here, the eigenvalue parameter q is ω/c0, where ω is a natural frequency

and c0 is a reference wave speed. Comparing the time dependencies one gets the quantum and

classical relation E = ¯hω. The localized state could thus be determined via E or the rarefaction

parameter (h) which is related to the ratio of the collision frequency and the wave frequency

[12].
The complex spectra (λ = λr+ i λi; the real part λr = krc/(√2ω): sound dispersion, a relative
measure of the sound or phase speed; the imaginary part λi = kic/(√2ω) : sound attenuation
or absorption) could be obtained from the complex polynomial equation above. Here, the

Pauli-blocking parameter (B) could be related to the occupation number of diﬀerent-statistic

particles of gases [10]. To examine the critical region possibly tuned by the Pauli-blocking

measure B = γN0 and the free orientation θ, as evidenced from previous Boltzmann results

[12] (cf. Chu therein) : λi = 0 for cases of θ = π/4 (or B =

decreases from 1 to -1), respectively. Note that, as the free-orientation θ is not zero, there will

≈

be two kinds of propagation of the disturbance wave : sound and diﬀusion modes [13-14]. The

latter (anomalous) mode has been reported in Boltzmann gases (cf. Ref. 12 by Chu) and is

related to the propagation of entropy wave which is not used in the acoustical analog here. The

absence of (further) diﬀusion (or maximum absorption) for the sound mode at certain state (h,

corresponding to the inverse of energy E; cf. Chu in Ref. 12) is classiﬁed as a localized state

(resonance occurs) based on the acoustical analog [12]. The state of decreasing h might, in one

6

case [15], correspond to that of T (absolute temperature) decreasing as the mean free path is

increasing (density or pressure decreasing).

We have observed the max. λi (absorption of sound mode, relevant to the localization length
according to the acoustical analog [12]) drop to around four orders of magnitude from θ = 0.005

to 0.78535 (please see Chu (2001) in [12])! This is a clear demonstration of the eﬀect of free

orientations. Meanwhile, once the Pauli-blocking measure (B) increases or decreases from zero

(Boltzmann gases), the latter (Fermi gases : B < 0) shows opposite trend compared to that of

the former (Bose gases : B > 0) considering the shift of the max. λi state : δh. δh > 0 is for
increasing), and the reverse (δh < 0) is for Bose gases (B increasing)! This

illustrates partly the interaction eﬀect (through the Pauli exclusion principle). These results will

be crucial for further obtaining the phase diagram (as the density or temperature is changed)

tuned by both the free orientation and the interaction. Here, B =

1 or θ = 0, π/4 might be

ﬁxed points.

To check what happens when the temperature is decreased (or h is decreased) to near T = 0

or T = Tc, we collect all the data based on the acoustical analog from the dispersion relations
(especially the absorption of sound mode) we calculated for ranges in diﬀerent degrees of the

orientation (here, θ is up to π/4 considering single-particle scattering and binary collisions; in

fact, eﬀects of θ are symmetric w.r.t. θ = π/4 for 0

π/2; cf. Chu (2001) in Ref. 12)

and Pauli-blocking measure. After that, we plot the possible phase diagram for the inverse of

ﬁgure shows that as the temperature decreases to a rather low value, the orientation will decrease

sharply (at least for either Bose or Fermi gases). There is no doubt that this result resembles

qualitatively that proposed before [16] for cases of the pressure vs. temperature analogue.

On the other hand, qualitatively similar results (cf. Fig. 4 in [17] : theirin higher relative

pressure corresponding to λr here) show that (i) once the orientation θ increases, for the same h
(or temperature [15]), the dispersion λr (or the relative pressure [17]) increases (please refer to
(B: the Pauli-blocking parameter) increases, the dispersion (λr)
Chu (2001) in [12]); (ii) as
will reach the continuum or hydrodynamical limit (larger h or high temperature regime) earlier.

The phase speed of the plane (sound) wave in Bose gases (even for small but ﬁxed h) increases

more rapid than that of Fermi gases (w.r.t. to the higher temperature conditions : larger h) as

the relevant parameter B increases. For all the rarefaction measure (h), perturbed plane waves

propagate faster in Bose-particle gases than Boltzmann-particle and Fermi-particle gases (e.g.,

see [18] or [13]). In fact, the real part (λr) also resembles qualitatively those reported in [19] for
T > Tc cases.
As for the imaginary part (λi), there is the maximum absorption (or attenuation) for certain h
(the rarefaction parameter) which resembles that reported in [20] (cf. Fig. 1 (b) therein). We

observed a jump of the (relative) sound speed in the multiple scattering case (cf. Chu (2002) in

[12]) which was also reported in [21](at the phase transition between hadronic phase and QGP).

To know the detailed eﬀects of interactions (tuned by the Pauli-blocking parameter : B here)

7

and the orientation, which could be linked to the eﬀective number of thermodynamic degrees

of freedom (as stated in [11] : ν, for an ideal gas of massless, non-interacting constituents, ν

counts the number of bosonic degrees of freedom plus the number of fermionic degrees of freedom

weighted by 7/8), we plot θ (of which the localization or resonance occurs for speciﬁc B) vs.

T (the temperature, in arbitrary units) in Figs. 2 and 3 by referring to two possibly localized

states (θ = 0 or π/4; cf. Chu (2001) in [12]). The trends here resemble that of Fig. 1 in [11]

once the eﬀective number of thermodynamic degrees of freedom is proportional to the product

of the orientation and the Pauli-blocking parameter (ν

θ

B

behaviors separated by crossover regions as shown in Fig. 2. We remind the readers that for

the case of θ = π/4 dominated (Fig. 3), as the lower temperature is associated with the higher

density, fermions (B < 0) link to the lower temperature regime (under the same orientation).

It is clear that depending on the temperature regime investigated, there would be diﬀerent

values of ν. If there are diﬀerences between ours and those in [11] (presumed that the matter

under study is in (approximate) local thermal equilibrium. At RHIC, such evidence is believed

to be provided by the agreement of the elliptic ﬂow [22] measured in noncentral collisions with

hydrodynamic model predictions. Such predictions are based on the assumption that the matter

behaves like a ﬂuid in local thermal equilibrium, with arbitrarily short mean free paths and

correspondingly strong interactions.), one possible explanation could be that the assumption of

a completely thermal medium is a simpliﬁcation [23]. The acoustic perturbations we treated are

close to the thermodynamic equilibrium (for Bose or Fermi gases). Other reasoning is related to

the diﬀerent types of particles (with or without fragmentation) being considered. One interesting

observation is that the attenuation of jet (quenching) observed at RHIC resembles qualitatively

the attenuation of plane (sound) waves (cf. Chu in [12]).

With above results, then our approach could provide an eﬀective theory based on the opposite

picture of very strong interaction (via the tuning of B and θ) and very small mean free paths

(h is large) [24]. This can also be useful to the study of problems in astrophysics : like compact

stars. For instance, one of the most striking features of QCD is asymptotic freedom: the

force between quarks becomes arbitrarily weak as the characteristic momentum scale of their

interaction grows larger. This immediately suggests that at suﬃciently high densities and low

temperatures (corresponding to the case of Fig. 3 here; cf. Chu (2001) in [12] since θ = π/4

is also possible and thus dominates the localized behavior or transition) matter will consist of

a Fermi sea of essentially free quarks, whose behavior is dominated by the freest of them all:

the high-momentum quarks that live at the Fermi surface. If the strange matter hypothesis is

true, a new class of compact stars called strange stars should exist. They would form a distinct

and disconnected branch of compact stars and are not a part of the continuum of equilibrium

conﬁgurations that include white dwarfs and neutron stars. In principle, strange and neutron

stars could coexist.

To conclude in brief, our illustrations here, although are based on the acoustical analog of our

quantum discrete kinetic calculations, can indeed show the Fermi and Bose liquid (say, Cooper

pairs) and their critical behavior for the transition (at least valid to the regime T > Tc considering
the QGP) once the temperature is decreased to rather low values. We shall investigate more

complicated problems in the future [24-26] (e.g., the saturated orientation shown in Fig. 3

8

which is almost the same for all diﬀerent-statistic gases of particles might be relevant to the

Stefan-Boltzmann limit; cf. Fig. 5 in [25] by Rischke).

orientation (θ) and Knudsen number (Kn
the mean free path/wave length).
B > 0 : bosonic particles; B < 0 : fermionic particles [10]. The orientation is
related to the scattering. Kn might be transformed to the dimensionless or relative

∝

temperature (cf. Fig. 3 in [15] ).

The unit of T is arbitrary. B > 0 : bosonic particles; B < 0 : fermionic particles [10].
The trend here resembles that of Fig. 1 in [11] once ν (the eﬀective number
of thermodynamic degrees of freedom ) is

h (the rarefaction measure).

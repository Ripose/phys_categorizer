Abstract

The tree amplitudes in scalar ﬁeld theories are presented at all n. The momentum
routing of propagators is given at n-point in terms of a speciﬁed set of numbers, and
the mass expansion of the massive theories is generated. A group structure on the
diagrams is given. The tree amplitudes can be used to ﬁnd the eﬀective action.

Introduction

The tree amplitudes of gauge theories have been recently under a large amount of
interest, in view of the simpliﬁed derivation using the weak-weak duality of the gauge
theory with a twistor formulation. In general the tree amplitudes of quantum ﬁeld
theories are required in order to ﬁnd the L ≥ 1 loop amplitudes (the general form
is necessary also in the quantum derivative expansion [2]-[11]). In this work, scalar
ﬁeld theories are examined in order to generate the coeﬃcients of the scattering in
the mass expansion, and the general form of the classical amplitudes.

The mass expansion of the scalar graphs is direct to obtain. An obstacle is a
compact formula that spells out the momentum routing of the individual diagrams.
One way of generating this formula is by iterating the amplitudes through attaching
trees to the ladder diagrams. The means presented gives a mapping between a set
of integers that parameterize the diagram to another set of numbers that label the
propagators. (The ladders are eﬀectually rooted trees and can be useful for other
purposes, such as illustrating symmetry.)

The general momentum is suﬃcient to also specify massless scalar ﬁeld classical
scattering. The massless φ3 diagrams and their speciﬁcation are required in order
to notate all gauge theory and gravity theory tree-level amplitudes. The latter may
be obtained in a non-spinor helicity basis, but in closed form via the known string-
inspired tree-level rules. The complete speciﬁcation of the spin-1 and spin-2 classical
scattering is forthcoming [1].

with v the number of φ3 vertices, I the number of internal lines, and E the number
of external lines. The case of φ4 vertices is included by setting m = 2 and n = 0.

A derivation of loop amplitudes in either a coupling expansion involving the
parameters λi or in momenta require the general form of the classical scattering,
i.e. tree-level scattering. The general form at all n-point has not appeared in the
literature and is presented here. The φ3 and φ4 scalar ﬁeld theories pertinent to four
dimensions are examined in this work, although general theories may be examined as
well. The latter theories are of import to higher dimension operators (i.e. ’irrelevant’
ones from the deﬁnition of the renormalization group ﬂow) and to theories in various
dimensions.

φ3 Theory

The classical amplitudes considered are placed in a color ordered form; the pri-
mary ordering is (1, . . . , n); the non-colored theory’s amplitudes are derived by sum-
ming the sets permutations. A general scalar ﬁeld theory diagram at tree-level is
parameterized by the set of propagators at the momenta labeling them. The dia-
grams are labeled by

Dσ = λn−2

tσ(i,p) − m2 ,

Y

with the Lorentz invariants tσ(i,p) deﬁned by,

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

tσ(i,p) = (kσ(i) + . . . + kσ(i+p−1))2 .

The sets of permutations σ are what are required in order to specify the individual
diagrams. The full sets of combinatorics σ(i, p) form all of the diagrams. These
combinatorics, for a given uniform mass m, change between φ3 and φ4 theory, but
are necessary and suﬃcient to label all of the diagrams. An example 6-point graph
has the collection of the numbers as:

3

σ(1, 2) = σ(3, 2) = σ(5, 2) = σ(1, 4) = σ(3, 4) = σ(5, 4) = 1 .

(7)

These numbers parameterize the diagrams with the momenta on the external legs
following a cyclic ordering.

An additional vector η(i) is required in order to specify the color ordering. As

only the primary ordering of 1, . . . , n is considered, this vector is not relevant.

The individual terms in the scattering are parameterized by all of the individual
momenta ﬂows, found by the diagrams in (5); these terms are to be expanded in
momenta, using the mass parameter. Such an expansion is described in the ’eﬀective’
action by terms such as

Leﬀ =

λ3
m2 φ5 +

λ4
m3 (∂2φ3)φ3 + . . . .

(8)

In general all operators are found by expanding the classical scattering (i.e. the tree
diagrams) in derivatives, or rather in the mass. The coeﬃcients and the momenta
ﬂow are determined from the diagram’s momentum structure. The terms in the
action (8) can be constrained in the placement of the derivatives in the individual
terms of Leﬀ; as an example, at ﬁve-point only the φ2∂2φ3 are allowed due to the
momentum ﬂow of the contributing diagrams. This restriction on the momentum
structure becomes more apparent when the theory is quantized (classically) together
with higher dimension operators.

The general term of the classical scattering written in momentum space is,

The mass expansion of the diagrams in (9), i.e. with only the three-point coupling, is

with the coeﬃcient Cσ determined from the tree graphs. The additional set of per-
mutations ˜σ is required in order to specify the expansion of the propagators.

The momenta invariants tσ(i,p) at n-point are deﬁned in (6). In specifying the
eﬀective action comprised of all the terms in (10) the numbers and the orderings of

σ(i, p) (and ˜σ(i, p)) must be given. In general at n-point, the invariants are deﬁned for
i = 1 to i = n with a non-cyclic ordering of the numbers when p forces the numbers
of σ(j) to go beyond σ(n) (these numbers pertain to an n-point graph). For example,
at 6-point the sets of numbers of σ are labeled by a collecting the indices from 1 to
n in particular orderings such as (e.g. (1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 4).

The general φ3 n-point diagram, upon color ordering, is constructed from a pre-
ferred ladder diagram with n − 4 internal legs. At each of these legs is attached an
internal m < n point tree diagram. The sum of all of these ladder diagrams from
m = 1 to m = n − 4, with the currents attached, generates the complete sum of
graphs at tree level. These ladder diagrams at a ﬁxed ordering possess 2m permuta-
tions; they are illustrated in Figure 2. The propagator structure of these diagrams
can be found by iterating the lower-point ladder diagrams. The preferred basis in
terms of the ladder trees can be avoided, but some symmetry will be lost in in the
process.

The internal vertices are labeled so that the outer numbers from a two-particle
tree are carried into the tree diagram in a manner so that j > i is always chosen from
the two numbers. The numbers are carried in from the n most external lines. An
example diagram with the labeling is illustrated in Figure 3 in the case of four-point
currents which are to be attached to a ladder tree, and in Figure 4 for a ladder tree
with four internal lines.

The labeling of the vertices is such that in a current the unordered numbers are
suﬃcient to reconstruct the current. For an m-point current there are m − 1 vertices
and hence m − 1 numbers contained in φm(j). These m − 1 numbers are such that
the greatest number may occur m − 1 times, and must occur at least once, the next
largest number is m − 2, and so on. The smallest number can not occur in the set
contained in φm(j).

count. There are 5 and 15 in the counts. The set of numbers in φ(j) is ordered from
largest to least.

The 4 + m point ladder is labeled as κ = (a1; a2; . . . ; am+2). Each of the numbers
ai are from the last node of the current; the a1 and am+2 are the external 2-point trees.
The vertex numbers are found by the previous clockwise j > i labeling; the ladder
node numbers aj are used in this deﬁnition. (The construction could also be made
direct on an ordinary tree graph, without the use of currents, but some symmetry
would be lost.)

The numbers κ(i) and φ(j) are used to ﬁnd the propagators in the labeled dia-

The labeling of the kinematics, i.e. t[p]

, is direct from the deﬁnition of the vertices.

The numbers φn(i) can be arranged into the numbers (pi, [pi]), in which pi is
the repetition of the value of [pi]. Also, if the number pi equals zero, then [pi] is
not present in φn. These numbers can be used to obtain the t[q]
invariants without

The branch rule has to be iterated to obtain all of the poles. This rule checks the
number of vertices and matches to compare if there is a tree on it in a clockwise
manner. If not, then the external line number linitial is changed to linitial and the tree
is checked again. The i and q are labels to t[q]

The previous recipe pertains to currents, i.e. amplitudes with one leg oﬀ-shell
and without a line factor. There are m − 1 poles in an m-point current (does not
include the oﬀ-shell line in m, but does include the pole). In order to apply the recipe
to an amplitude, the three-point vertex is attached; the counting is clear when the
attached vertex has two external lines with numbers less than the smallest external
line number of the current. There are n − 3 poles in an n-point diagram, and these
lines are accounted for in the amplitude with this formula; the ladder diagrams with
their legs can be analyzed with this approach, or simply a current with the numbers
φm(i).

An example set of σ(i, p) pertains to several seven point diagrams, with the indices

i and p,

The inclusion of the φ4 term requires the additional coupling λ4 (in d = 4) that
alters the coeﬃcients Cσ. Higher dimension operators such as φ6/Λ2 for example, re-
quire further modiﬁcation of the tree results. The addition of these higher dimensional
operators is relevant to model the full quantum ﬁeld theory and its deformations, in
general QFTs.

The derivation of the general term in (10) is obtained by expanding the general

n-point graph using the standard propagators via

and collecting the terms in the power series. Due to the combinatorics σ(i, p) which
parameterize the momenta, the second factor ˜σ(i, p) is essentially arbitrary due to
the inﬁnite number of terms in the expansion (17); the entries are non-vanishing on
the support of the σ(i, p).

As an example, the zeroeth order term at n-point without the derivatives is simply
found by collecting the number of coupling constants and mass terms from propagator
expansions; the term at n-point is,

ing to these non-derivative terms are,

Cσ,˜σ = 1 ,

(19)

with σ essentially undetermined for the n-point amplitude. The remaining terms
require the expansions of the internal tree propagators, with momenta following the
routings of these lines.

these nodes. The label pertains to the external trees’ number.

The crux then to ﬁnding the general term in (10) is in the orderings of σ(i, p).
The coeﬃcients are direct, due to the unity coeﬃcient of (17) in the expansion of the
individual propagators. The powers in the mass expansion are labeled via all integers
attached to the propagators, i.e. ˜σ(i, p). The symmetry factors of the diagrams are
relevant, in addition to the signature of space-time due to the sign in p2 ± m2. The
set of σ(i, p) are required to determine all of the terms in the classical eﬀective action.
The classical ’quantization’ could be carried on the basis of the σ(i, p), or φn(j), as
all diagrams are constructable with these vectors.

The general σn(i, p) can be determined via the collection of numbers in φn(i) in

(13) or (14), and the latter can be labeled by the polynomials,

P (σ) = X σn(i, p)ypxi ,

(20)

with the coeﬃcients (i, p) generating the expansion; the coeﬃcients are unity as the
propagator either exists or not (i.e. zero or one). The numbers i are constrained
between 1 and n, and those of p are bounded by 2 to n − 1; the polynomial is
essentially a matrix.

This polynomial in (20) should satisfy a diﬀerential equation due to its polynomial
nature. For example, a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator generates solutions in

11

terms of Hermite polynomials, with a speciﬁed degeneracy at level n1 + n2. The
expansion of the polynomials in the wavefunction ψ(x, y) = Hn1n2e−x2−y2
generate
sets of coeﬃcients; alternatively an OSp(n, n) wavefunction with the grassmann and
base expansion could generate the P (σ) expansion. An example diﬀerential equation
at level n-point could generate all of the coeﬃcients, and one of the form

(cid:16)∂2

x + ∂2

y + Vn(x, y)(cid:17) ψn(x, y) = εnψn(x, y) ,

(21)

is desired (or an OSp(n, n) eigenoperator), with degeneracy and form of the wavefunc-
tion ψn(x, y) that of the tree-level ﬁeld theory diagrams. The momenta associated
with the operator in (21) is obtained with the ordering of the σ in a cyclic fashion,
i.e. the principle color ordered series of 1, 2, . . . , n.

The degeneracy of diagrams in ﬁeld theory for various ﬁeld theories at n-point
goes as n!, and in gauge theory the number of indepedent ones at tree level taking
into account Ward identities and color orderings follows approximately as (n − 2)!.
The speciﬁc counting of color ordered φ3 graphs at n-point for low orders of n at tree
level is,

The count of φ4 graphs at low orders of n is,

The general count of the tree diagrams follows from the various number theoretic
combinations of φn(i); that is, the count of sets of n numbers from n to 2 with the
maximal occurence of each number being n − 1 to 1. This is clearly a factorial. The
count of the φ4 diagrams is obtained by eliminating propagators in φ3 graphs.

The algebra associated to tree diagrams can be made clear with the explicit
parameterization in this section (see [12], [13] to ﬁnd deﬁnitions of Hopf structures on
rooted trees). The set of numbers φn(i) form a basis with an OSp structure. The jth
number may repeat at most j times in a set of n − 1 elements; the set of numbers and
the combinations is more algebraic. The operations on trees have an action on these

vectors φn(i), such as eliminating nodes or propagators or exchanging the orders of
legs. The sets of numbers φn(i) make the Hopf algebra of the rooted trees explicit,
and the algebra can be obtained without reference to diagrams.

Another structure in the scalar theory is obtained from the currents attached to
the ladder diagrams, which is not the most general one. These trees may be associated
with elements Gi and a Z2 which orients the branch, illustrated in Figure 5. Bracket
operations such as [Gi, Gj] can be placed on the trees, in accord with the labeling
and dimension of the currents’ vector space.

Algebras in further classical scalar theories presumably may be obtained by pinch-
ing the φ3 diagrams to obtain their graphs, and then using the set of numbers φn(i).
The classical quantization can be performed by using these numbers directly to ob-
tain the tree diagrams. The discrete symmetry of the set of φn, for all n, may be
understood as an extension of the Poincare algebra (which generates the Lagrangian).
It should be useful in the quantization.

φ4 Theory

In the case of φ4 theory the momentum routing of the individual diagrams is also

modeled by a set of polynomials at n-point,

13

P (σn) = X σ4(i, p)xiyp .

(24)

The determination of the general term in the scattering at tree-level follows in almost
the same manner, except that the coupling constant has mass dimension in d = 4 and
appears with a diﬀerent factor at n-point (λn/2−1
). The color ordered
φ4 diagrams can be obtained by pinching the propagators, i.e. removing non-adjacent
propagators in certain φ3 trees.

instead of λn−2

Several ladder φ4 diagrams are illustrated in Figure 5. The pinching of φ3 dia-
grams is straightforward to obtain. These ladder diagrams are relevant for the same
reason as the φ3 ones are: the potential sewing of currents to obtain amplitudes
(which is not required), and the manifestation of an algebra of the currents and of
the theory’s classical scattering.

The diagrams are deﬁned by the φ(4)

n (i) numbers, which can be found by prop-
n (i). The pinches occur on every other propagator, and this

agator pinching of φ(3)
translates to an altering of the set of φ(3)

n (i).

The expansion in momenta (or in the mass) is accomplished via the power expan-
sion of the individual propagators. The general term in the scattering as a function
of the kinematic invariants is given by (with σ4 → σ),

The primary diﬀerences between the φ3 and φ4 theories are: 1) the powers of
the coupling and mass diﬀer due to the diﬀerence in the number of propagators, and
2) the combinatoric factor φ(4)
n (i) (or σ4(i, p)) which labels the diﬀerent momentum
routing along the φ4 diagrams.

The degeneracy of the solutions should match the number of sets of vertex numbers
σ4(i, p), which generate the tree amplitudes of the theory.

φ3 and φ4 Theory

The combination of φ3 and φ4 scalar interactions can be examined in the same
context as φ4 theory. The momentum ﬂow of diagrams in this theory, as in the φ3
theory, can be used to generates the propagator momentum ﬂow in gauge theories
although this theory is not required for that purpose. Tuning the couplings also
interpolates between the two scalar examples.

The general form of the tree diagrams are more complicated as the number of
propagators at a given n-point varies and is not a function only of the number of
external lines (4). For example, at 6-point there may be one propagator in a pure φ4
graph or three propagators in a φ3 graph. The general form of the momenta routing
is,

The coeﬃcients Cσ˜σ factors, i.e. the momentum tensor factors, diﬀer from the individ-
ual φ3, φ4 theories. These may be obtained from pinching any numbers of propagators
in a φ3 diagram.

The σ(i, p) combinatorics is again to be generated by the vector space of functions
σ3,4xiyj, with degeneracy at level n that of the number of n-point diagrams.

Conclusions

The set of tree amplitudes in φ3 and other scalar ﬁeld theories is given. These
amplitudes are obtained through sets of numbers φn which describe the propagator
structure. The sets of numbers are quite simple; there are n − 1 of them from 2 to
n and the jth one cant occur more than j − 1 times. The φ4 and φ3 theories, with
higher dimensional operators such as φ6/Λ2, are also number theoretic classically; the
amplitudes of these theories can be found by pinching propagators of the φ3 theory
in a systematic fashion, which generates a map to φn. Two dimensional models (and
other dimensions) can also be examined in this content, in which the φm interactions
are perturbatively renormalizable.

16

Classical scattering of these scalar theories are relevant examples for theories with
non-vanishing spin. The routing of the propagators in these examples is necessary
for the latter theories. These amplitudes can be covariantized in order to ﬁnd the
classical eﬀective action.

The symmetries of the tree level scattering are obtainable through the vertex
algebra associated with the diagrams, i.e. φn(i). The sets of numbers and their
group aspect can be considered a discrete extension of the Poincare algebra. These
numbers may be used for a direct classical quantization of the scattering, as given in
the text. Further sets of numbers, which label the propagators, and their symmetries,
are necessary for the quantization of higher loops by a direct writing down of the loop
amplitudes without performing integrals.

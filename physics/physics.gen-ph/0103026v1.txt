Di(cid:27)erent formulations of speial relativity are theoretially disussed. First an invariant formu-

lation, i.e., the (cid:17)true transformations (TT) relativity,(cid:17) is exposed. There a physial quantity is

represented by a true tensor whih omprises both omponents and a basis. Also the usual o-

variant formulation and the (cid:17)apparent transformations (AT) relativity(cid:17) are onsidered. It is shown

that all the experiments are in agreement with the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) but not always with the (cid:17)AT

relativity.(cid:17)

1 INTRODUCTION

In the reent papers [1℄ and [2℄ an invariant formulation of speial relativity (SR) is proposed and

it is alled the (cid:17)true transformations (TT) relativity.(cid:17) Furthermore the di(cid:27)erenes between this

formulation, the usual ovariant approah to SR and the traditionally used (cid:17)apparent transforma-

tions (AT) relativity(cid:17) (a typial example of the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) is Einstein's [3℄ formulation of SR)

are also examined in [1℄ and [2℄. Some parts of these formulations are disussed in [4℄, [5℄ as well.

The notions of the TT and the AT are (cid:28)rst introdued by Rohrlih [6℄, and, in the same meaning,

but not under that name, disussed in [7℄ too. In [1, 2℄ (and [4, 5℄) we have also presented the

theoretial disussion of the TT of the spaetime length for a moving rod and a moving lok, and

of the AT for the same examples, i.e., the AT of the spatial distane, the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration,(cid:17)

and the AT of the temporal distane, the time (cid:17)dilatation.(cid:17)

In this paper we expose the main

theoretial results from [1, 2, 4, 5℄ and ompare them with some experimental results.

It is usually interpreted that the experiments on (cid:17)length ontration(cid:17) and (cid:17)time dilatation(cid:17) test

SR, but the theoretial disussion from [1, 2℄ shows that suh an interpretation of the experiments

refers exlusively to the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) and not to the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17)

It has to be noted that in the experiments in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) in the same way as in the

theory, see [1, 2℄, the measurements in di(cid:27)erent inertial frames of referene (IFRs) (and di(cid:27)erent

oordinatizations) have to refer to the same four-dimensional (4D) tensor quantity. In the hosen

IFR and the hosen oordinatization the measurement of some 4D quantity has to ontain the

measurements of all parts of suh a quantity. However in almost all experiments that refer to

SR only the quantities belonging to the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) were measured. From the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

viewpoint suh measurements are inomplete, sine only some parts of a 4D quantity, not all,

are measured. This fat presents a serious di(cid:30)ulty in the reliable omparison of the existing

experiments with the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) and, atually, we shall be able to ompare in a quantitative

manner only some of the existing experiments with the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17)

To examine the di(cid:27)erenes between the nonrelativisti theory, the ommonly used (cid:17)AT relativ-

ity,(cid:17) and the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) we shall make the omparison of these theories with some experiments

in the following setions.

First in Se. 2 we brie(cid:29)y expose the main theoretial results from [1, 2℄ about the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

and its theoretial omparison with the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and with the usual ovariant approah. In

Se. 4 we disuss the (cid:17)muon(cid:17) experiment in the nonrelativisti approah, in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)

and in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) Sine the Mihelson-Morley experiment is disussed in detail in [2℄ we

expose in Ses. 5 and 5.1 only the main results from [2℄ in order to use them for the onsideration

of the modern laser versions in Se. 5.2 and for the disussion of the Kennedy-Thorndike type

experiments in Se. 6. In Ses. 7, 7.1 and 7.2 we onsider di(cid:27)erent Iwes-Stillwel type experiments

both in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) Se. 7.1, and in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) Se. 7.2. Finally in Se. 8 the

disussion and onlusions are presented.

2 A BRIEF THEORETICAL DISCUSSION OF THE THREE

APPROACHES TO SR

Rohrlih [6℄, and also Gamba [7℄, emphasized the role of the onept of sameness of a physial

quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. The prinipal di(cid:27)erene between the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and the (cid:17)AT

relativity(cid:17) stems from the di(cid:27)erene in that onept of sameness of a physial system, i.e., of a

physial quantity, for di(cid:27)erent observers. This onept of sameness of a physial quantity for

di(cid:27)erent observers atually determines the di(cid:27)erene in what is to be understood as a relativisti

theory. Our invariant approah to SR, i.e., the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) and the onept of sameness of a

physial quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers in that approah, di(cid:27)ers not only from the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)

approah but also from the usual ovariant approah (inluding [6℄ and [7℄).

In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) SR is understood as the theory of a 4D spaetime with pseudo-Eulidean

geometry. All physial quantities (in the ase when no basis has been introdued) are desribed

by true tensor (cid:28)elds, that are de(cid:28)ned on the 4D spaetime, and that satisfy true tensor equations

representing physial laws. When the oordinate system has been introdued the physial quantities

are mathematially represented by the oordinate-based geometri quantities (CBGQs) that satisfy

2

the oordinate-based geometri equations. The CBGQs ontain both the omponents and the basis

one-forms and vetors of the hosen IFR. Speaking in mathematial language a tensor of type (k,l)

is de(cid:28)ned as a linear funtion of k one-forms and l vetors (in old names, k ovariant vetors and l

ontravariant vetors) into the real numbers, see, e.g., [8, 9, 10℄. If a oordinate system is hosen

in some IFR then, in general, any tensor quantity an be reonstruted from its omponents and

from the basis vetors and basis 1-forms of that frame, i.e., it an be written in a oordinate-

based geometri language, see, e.g., [10℄. The symmetry transformations for the metri gab , i.e.,
then (Φ∗g)ab = gab. Thus
the isometries [8℄, do not hange gab ; if we denote an isometry as Φ∗

an isometry leaves the pseudo-Eulidean geometry of 4D spaetime of SR unhanged. At the

same time they do not hange the true tensor quantities, or equivalently the CBGQs, in physial

equations. Thus isometries are what Rohrlih [6℄ alls the TT. In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) di(cid:27)erent

oordinatizations of an IFR are allowed and they are all equivalent in the desription of physial

phenomena. Partiularly two very di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations, the Einstein ((cid:17)e(cid:17)) [3℄ and (cid:17)radio(cid:17)

((cid:17)r(cid:17)) [11℄ oordinatization are disussed in [1, 2℄ and [5℄ and will be exploited in this paper as

well. (In the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization the Einstein synhronization [3℄ of distant loks and artesian

spae oordinates xi

are used in the hosen IFR. The main features of the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization

will be given below. For the reent disussion of the onventionality of synhronization see [12℄

and referenes therein.) The CBGQs representing some 4D physial quantity in di(cid:27)erent relatively

moving IFRs, or in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of the hosen IFR, are al l mathematial ly equal sine

they are onneted by the TT (i.e., the isometries). Thus they are really the same quantity for

di(cid:27)erent observers, or in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations. Hene in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the same quantity

for di(cid:27)erent observers is either the true tensor quantity or the CBGQ. Therefore it is appropriate

to all the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) approah (whih deals with the true tensors or with the CBGQs) as an

invariant approah in ontrast to the usual ovariant approah (whih deals with the omponents

of tensors taken in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization). We suppose that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) suh 4D

tensor quantities are wel l-de(cid:28)ned not only mathematial ly but also experimental ly, as measurable

quantities with real physial meaning. The omplete and wel l-de(cid:28)ned measurement from the (cid:17)TT

relativity(cid:17) viewpoint is suh measurement in whih al l parts of some 4D quantity are measured.

In the usual ovariant approah one does not deal with the true tensors, or equivalently with

CBGQs, but with the basis omponents of tensors (mainly in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) and with the

equations of physis written out in the omponent form. Mathematially speaking the onept of a

tensor in the usual ovariant approah is de(cid:28)ned entirely in terms of the transformation properties

of its omponents relative to some oordinate system. Hene in the usual ovariant approah the

same quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers is the omponent form of a true tensor, or equivalently of a

CBGQ, in some spei(cid:28) oordinatization. The de(cid:28)nitions of the same quantity in [6℄ and [7℄ also

refer to suh omponent form in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization of tensor quantities and tensor equations.

Although it is true that the omponents of some tensor refer to the same tensor quantity onsidered

in two relatively moving IFRs S and S′

and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, but they are not the same

4D quantity sine the bases are not inluded. This will be expliitly shown below.

The third approah to SR uses the AT of some quantities.

In ontrast to the TT (i.e., the

isometries) the AT are not the transformations of spaetime tensors and they do not refer to the

same 4D quantity. The AT refer exlusively to the omponent form of tensor quantities and in that

form they transform only some omponents of the whole tensor quantity. In fat, depending on the

used AT, only a part of a 4D tensor quantity is transformed by the AT. Suh a part of a 4D quantity,

when onsidered in di(cid:27)erent IFRs (or in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of some IFR) orresponds to

di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D spaetime. Some examples of the AT are: the AT of the synhronously

de(cid:28)ned spatial length [3℄, i.e., the Lorentz ontration, and the AT of the temporal distane, i.e., the

onventional dilatation of time that is introdued in [3℄ and onsidered in [1, 2℄. Any formulation

of SR whih uses the AT we all the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) An example of suh formulation is Einstein's

formulation of SR whih is based on his two postulates and whih deals with all the mentioned

AT. Thus in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) the same quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers is onsidered to be a part

of a 4D tensor quantity whih is transformed by the AT.

In this paper I use the same onvention with regard to indies as in [1, 2℄. Repeated indies

imply summation. Latin indies a, b, c, d, ... are to be read aording to the abstrat index notation,

see [8℄, Se.2.4.; they (cid:17)...should be viewed as reminders of the number and type of variables the

tensor ats on, not as basis omponents.(cid:17) They designate geometri ob jets in 4D spaetime. Thus,

A,B are (1,0) tensors and they are de(cid:28)ned independently of any oordinate
system. Greek indies run from 0 to 3, while latin indies i, j, k, l, ... run from 1 to 3, and they both
designate the omponents of some geometri ob jet in some oordinate system, e.g., xµ(x0, xi) and
xµ
oordinate systems S and S′. Similarly the metri tensor gab denotes a tensor of type (0,2) (whose
Riemann urvature tensor Ra
bcd is everywhere vanishing; the spaetime of speial relativity is a

(cid:29)at spaetime, and this de(cid:28)nition inludes not only the IFRs but also the aelerated frames of

the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, i.e., in the {eµ} basis, by the 4 × 4 diagonal matrix of omponents of
gab , gµν,e = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1), and this is usually alled the Minkowski metri tensor. Note that the

subsript

stands for the Einstein oordinatization.

In the following we shall also need the expression for the ovariant 4D Lorentz transformations

Now we an better explain the above mentioned di(cid:27)erene between three approahes to SR in

the understanding of the onept of the same quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. We shall onsider

some simple examples in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17): the spaetime length for a moving rod and then for

a moving lok. The same examples will be also examined in the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17)

2.1 The spaetime length for a moving rod and a moving lok

Let us take, for simpliity, to work in 2D spaetime. Then we onsider a true tensor quantity, a

distane 4-vetor (the (1,0) tensor) la
4-vetors xa
orresponds to an ob jet, a rod, that is at rest in an IFR S and situated along the ommon x1

A between two events A and B (with the position

in the oordinate-based geometri language in di(cid:27)erent bases, {eµ} and {rµ} in an IFR S, and {eµ′ }
and {rµ′ } in a relatively moving IFR S′, as la
AB = lµ
r rµ′ , where, e.g., eµ
are the basis 4-vetors, e0 = (1, 0, 0, 0) and so on, and lµ
e are the basis omponents when the (cid:17)e(cid:17)
oordinatization is hosen in some IFR S. The deompositions lµ

(in a relatively moving IFR S′

These examples provide a nie possibility to disover the di(cid:27)erene in the onept of the same

quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers between the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and the usual ovariant approah to SR.

The usual ovariant approah does not onsider the true tensor quantity, e.g., the distane 4-vetor

la
AB (or equivalently the CBGQ lµ
oordinatization. The basis omponents (e.g., lµ

not equal, lµ

From the mathematial point of view the omponents of, e.g., a (1, 0) tensor are its values (real
numbers) when the basis one-form, for example, eα, is its argument (see, e.g., [9℄). Thus, for
example, la

2.2 The (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and the AT of speial and temporal distanes

As already said the AT refer exlusively to the omponent form of tensor quantities and in that form

they transform only some omponents of the whole tensor quantity. Suh a part of a 4D quantity,

when onsidered in di(cid:27)erent IFRs (or in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of some IFR), orresponds to

di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D spaetime. The usual, i.e., Einstein's formulation of SR is based on two

postulates: the priniple of relativity and the postulate that the oordinate, one-way, speed of light

is isotropi and onstant. In that formulation the AT of the synhronously de(cid:28)ned spatial length

[3℄ and the AT of the temporal distane [3℄ are onsidered as the main (cid:17)relativisti(cid:17) onsequenes of

the postulates. Namely the Lorentz transformations are derived from the two mentioned postulates

and then the Lorentz ontration and the dilatation of time are interpreted as that they are the

Lorentz transformations of spatial and temporal distanes. However the Lorentz transformations

are the TT, as an be seen from the preeding setions; they always transform the whole 4D tensor

6

quantity and thus they refer to the same quantity in 4D spaetime, see, e.g., the relations (8) and

(11), or (9) and (12). Sine the Lorentz transformations are the TT, i.e., the isometries, they also

do not hange the pseudo-Eulidean geometry of the spaetime. On the other hand, as will be

shown below, the Lorentz ontration and the dilatation of time are typial examples of the AT.

The Einstein formulation of SR uses the AT, e.g., the Lorentz ontration and the dilatation of

time, as important ingredients of the theory (and also in experimental testing of the theory). Any

formulation of SR, whih uses some of the AT, we all the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17)

In order to better explain the di(cid:27)erene between the TT and the AT we now onsider the

same two examples as above but from the point of view of the onventional, i.e., Einstein's [3℄

interpretations of the spatial length of the moving rod and the temporal distane for the moving

lok. These examples are already onsidered in [1, 2℄ and [5℄ and here we only quote the main

results and the de(cid:28)nitions.

The synhronous de(cid:28)nition of the spatial length, introdued by Einstein [3℄, de(cid:28)nes length as

the spatial distane between two spatial points on the (moving) ob jet measured by simultaneity

in the rest frame of the observer. The onept of sameness of a physial quantity is quite di(cid:27)erent

in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) but in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17)

Indeed, in the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) one takes

only some basis omponents of the whole 4D tensor quantity la
and lµ

e eµ
) in S and S′, then performs some additional manipulations with them, and onsiders

AB (that is, of the CBGQs lµ

′

e eµ′

that the onstruted quantities represent the same physial quantity for observers in two relatively

. Thus for the Einstein's de(cid:28)nition of the spatial length one onsiders only

moving IFRs S and S′
the omponent l1
e is taken = 0, i.e., the spatial ends of the rod at rest in
S are taken simultaneously at t = 0) and ompares it with the quantity whih is obtained in the
′
following way; (cid:28)rst one performs the Lorentz transformation Lµ
ν′,e of the basis omponents lµ
e
(but not of the basis itself ) from S′

e eµ (when l0

e = L0 of lµ

to S, whih yields
e = γel0′

e = γel1′
l1

e + γeβel1′
e
e + γeβel0′
e .

(13)

(14)

Then one retains only the transformation of the spatial omponent l1
(13)) negleting ompletely the transformation of the temporal part l0
Furthermore in the transformation for l1
the spatial ends of the rod moving in S′
quantity obtained in suh a way will be denoted as L1′
transformation equations (13)) This quantity L1′
determined spatial length of the moving rod in S′

e (the (cid:28)rst equation in (13)).
e one takes that the temporal part in S′ l0′
e = 0, ( i.e.,
are taken simultaneously at some arbitrary t′ = b). The

e (it is not equal to l1′

e appearing in the

e de(cid:28)nes in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) the synhronously
. The mentioned proedure gives l1
e , that

e = γeL1′

e (the seond equation in

is, the famous formula for the Lorentz ontration,

L1′
e = l1

e/γe = L0/γe,

This quantity, L1′
and L1′
The omparison with the relation (8) learly shows that onstruted quantities L0 and L1′

e = L0/γe, is the usual Lorentz ontrated spatial length, and the quantities L0
e are onsidered in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) to be the same quantity for observers in S and S′

.

e are two

di(cid:27)erent and independent quantities in 4D spaetime. Namely, these quantities are obtained by

the same measurements in S and S′; the spatial ends of the rod are measured simultaneously at
; a in S and b in S′
some te = a in S and also at some t′
transformation Lµ
ν,e or any other oordinate transformation. Thus, in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the same
quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers is the tensor quantity, the 4-vetor la
r rµ =
lµ
r rµ′ ; only one quantity in 4D spaetime. However in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D
spaetime, the spatial l distanes l1

e (or in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization l1

e = b in S′

r ) are onsidered as

e eµ′ = lµ

e eµ = lµ

AB = lµ

e, L1′

r, L1′

′

′

are not related by the Lorentz

the same quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. The relation for the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) of the moving

rod in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization an be easily obtained performing the same proedure as in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

oordinatization, and it is

L1′
r = L0/K = (1 + 2βr)

−1/2L0,

see also [1, 2℄ and [5℄. We see from (15) that there is a length dilatation ∞ ≻ L1′
−1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0 and the standard length (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) L0 ≻ L1′

r ≻ L0 for
r ≻ 0 for positive βr, whih learly

(15)

shows that the (cid:17)Lorentz ontration(cid:17) is not physially orretly de(cid:28)ned transformation. Thus the

7

Lorentz ontration is the transformation that onnets di(cid:27)erent quantities (in 4D spaetime) in S
and S′, or in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations, whih implies that it is - an AT.

The same example of the (cid:17)muon deay(cid:17) will be now onsidered in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) (see also

[1, 2℄). In the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization the events A and B are again on the world line of a muon that
is at rest in S. We shall see one again that the onept of sameness of a physial quantity is quite
di(cid:27)erent in the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) Thus for this example one ompares the basis omponent l0
e = cτ0
e eµ with the quantity, whih is obtained from the basis omponent l0′
of lµ
e in the following manner;
(cid:28)rst one performs the Lorentz transformation of the basis omponents lµ
itself ) from the muon rest frame S to the frame S′

e (but not of the basis

in whih the muon is moving. This proedure

yields

l0′
e = γel0
l1′
e = γel1

e − γeβel1
e
e − γeβel0
e.

(16)

Similarly as in the Lorentz ontration one now forgets the transformation of the spatial part l1′
(the seond equation in (16)) and onsiders only the transformation of the temporal part l0′

e

e (the

(cid:28)rst equation in (16)). This is, of ourse, an inorret step from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint.

Be = x1

Then taking that l1
e = 0 (i.e., that x1
one (cid:28)nds the new quantity whih will be denoted as L0′
transformation equations (16)). The temporal distane l0
(cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, the muon lifetime at rest, while L0′
e is onsidered in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) and in
the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, to de(cid:28)ne the lifetime of the moving muon in S′. The relation onneting
L0′
e with l0
e, whih is obtained by the above proedure, is then the well-known relation for the time

e (it is not the same as l0′

e de(cid:28)nes in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) and in the

Ae ) in the equation for l0′

e (the (cid:28)rst equation in (16))

e appearing in the

(cid:17)dilatation,(cid:17)

L0′
e /c = t

′

e = γel0

e/c = τ0(1 − β2
e )

−1/2.

(17)

By the same proedure we an (cid:28)nd (see also [1, 2℄) the relation for the time (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) in the (cid:17)r(cid:17)

oordinatization

L0′
r = Kl0

r = (1 + 2βr)1/2cτ0.
This relation shows that the new quantity L0′
r , whih de(cid:28)nes in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) the temporal
separation in S′, where the lok is moving, is smaller - (cid:17)time ontration(cid:17) - than the temporal
separation l0
r = cτ0 in S, where the lok is at rest, for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0, and it is larger - (cid:17)time
dilatation(cid:17) - for 0 ≺ βr ≺ ∞. From this onsideration we onlude that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the
same quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers is the tensor quantity, the 4-vetor la
e eµ′ =
r rµ = lµ
lµ
r rµ′ ; only one quantity in 4D spaetime. However in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) di(cid:27)erent quantities
r, L0′
in 4D spaetime, the temporal distanes l0

r are onsidered as the same quantity for

e eµ = lµ

AB = lµ

e, L0′

e , l0

(18)

di(cid:27)erent observers. This shows that the time (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) is the transformation onneting di(cid:27)erent

quantities (in 4D spaetime) in S and S′, or in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations, whih implies that it is

- an AT.

The onsideration performed in the preeding setions and in this setion reveals that the basi

elements of the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) as an (cid:17)invariant(cid:17) formulation of SR, and of the usual Einstein

formulation of SR, as an (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) formulation, are quite di(cid:27)erent. Einstein's formulation is

based on two postulates: (i) the priniple of relativity and (ii) the postulate that the oordinate,

one-way, speed of light is isotropi and onstant. In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the primary importane is

attributed to the geometry of the spaetime; it is supposed that the geometry of our 4D spaetime

is a pseudo-Eulidean geometry. The physial quantities are represented by geometri quantities,

either by true tensors (when no basis is hosen) or equivalently (when the oordinate basis is

introdued) by the CBGQs. Thene in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) there is no need to postulate the

priniple of relativity as a fundamental law. It is replaed by the requirement that the physial

laws must be expressed as true tensor equations or equivalently as the oordinate-based geometri

equations in the 4D spaetime. Sine the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) deals on the same footing with all possible

oordinatizations of a hosen referene frame then the seond Einstein postulate (ii) also does not

hold, in general, in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) Namely, as we have remarked earlier, only in Einstein's

oordinatization the oordinate, one-way, speed of light is isotropi and onstant, while in, e.g.,

the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, it is not the ase.

In numerous textbooks and papers the Lorentz ontration and the dilatation of time are

onsidered as very important (cid:17)relativisti e(cid:27)ets.(cid:17)

In the disussions about these e(cid:27)ets it is

always understood that the oordinate Lorentz transformation Lµ
transforms the rest length L0 to the Lorentz ontrated length L1′

′

ν,e (2) in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization

e , i.e., the formula for the Lorentz

ontration (14) is interpreted as the Lorentz transformation of the synhronously determined rest

length L0. Similarly happens with the formula for the time dilatation (17), whih is interpreted as
the Lorentz transformation of the proper time interval τ0 (both events happen at the same spatial
point) to the time interval L0′
e /c in the moving frame in whih these events happen at di(cid:27)erent

spatial points. Our onsideration about the spaetime length and the AT of spatial and temporal

distanes reveals that the Lorentz ontration and the dilatation of time are the AT and have

nothing to do with the Lorentz transformation as the TT. Thus the Lorentz ontration and the

dilatation of time are ertainly not true relativisti transformations, or to be more preise, they have

nothing in ommon with SR. They surely are not important relativisti e(cid:27)ets. Already in 1967.

physis, it will probably ontinue to remain in the books as an historial reli for the fasination

of the layman.(cid:17) From our onsideration follows that the same an be said for the dilatation of

time. However, what is really surprising, after more than thirty years from Rohrlih's paper [6℄

and Gamba's paper [7℄ the Lorentz ontration and the dilatation of time are still intensively

investigated theoretially and experimentally as relativisti e(cid:27)ets in numerous sienti(cid:28) papers

and books.

It is generally believed that the apparatus for high-energy experiments in partile

physis are aready designed in suh a way that they take into aount longer deay time (the

dilatation of time) for moving partile. In the leading physial journals, e.g., in Physial Review

C under the heading - Relativisti Nulear Collisions, one an permanently enounter theoretial

and experimental artiles in whih the Lorentz ontration is understood as an essential part of the

relativisti theory. Thus, for example, it is generally aepted in ultra-relativisti nulear ollisions,

see, e.g., [14℄: (cid:17)that in the enter-of-mass frame two highly Lorentz ontrated nulei (my emphasis)

pass through eah other ....

.(cid:17) Also it is taken in ultrarelativisti heavy-ion reations that, e.g.,

[15℄: (cid:17)While the longitudinal extension of the valene quarks in a fast-moving nuleon does indeed

look Lorentz ontrated (my emphasis) to a stationary observer in the usual way... .(cid:17) This issue of

ultra-relativisti nulear ollisions will be disussed in more detail elsewhere.

2.3 The disussion of some other de(cid:28)nitions of the spatial length

Next we onsider two other de(cid:28)nitions of the spatial length. The (cid:28)rst one is an (cid:17)asynhronous(cid:17)

de(cid:28)nition, see, e.g., [17℄ and [18℄ and the referenes therein. (Atually one an speak about the

asynhronous formulation of SR.) Aording to the asynhronous desription the spatial length of a

moving body is de(cid:28)ned as the spatial distane between two points on it, as measured by simultaneity

in the rest frame of the body. Namely in the asynhronous formulation of SR the distane 4-vetor

B − xa

A between two events A and B (with the position 4-vetors xa

la
AB = xa
B ) is written
only in the omponent form and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. In S, the rest frame of the body, it
is (in 2D spaetime) lµ
AB = (0, L0) (L0 is the rest length and it is determined synhronously in
S ). In S′, where the body is moving, the omponent form in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization of la
AB is
lµ
AB = (−βeγeL0, γeL0). Now omes the main point in the asynhronous de(cid:28)nition. It is interpreted
in the asynhronous formulation of SR that the spatial part l1′
(cid:17)asynhronous(cid:17) length L′
frame S′

AB is the
, determined asynhronously (sine the temporal part is 6= 0), in the

AB = γeL0 = L′

A and xa

of lµ

in whih the body is moving. One an say that there is a Lorentz lengthening in the

′

′

asynhronous formulation, instead of the usual Lorentz ontration that exists in the (cid:17)synhronous,(cid:17)

i.e., the Einstein formulation of SR. It is onsidered in the asynhronous formulation that L′
S′

and L0 in S refer to the same quantity. The ommon feature for both formulations is that the

in

spatial length of a moving body is assumed to be a wel l de(cid:28)ned physial quantity in 4D spaetime.

Our formulation with true tensors (or the CBGQs) reveals that this is not true; a well de(cid:28)ned

physial quantity in 4D spaetime that is onneted with a moving body an be only a 4D tensor

quantity, e.g., either the spaetime length l (10), or the distane 4-vetor la

AB = xa

B − xa

A. If,

for example, one does not use the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization but the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, then both

formulations (synhronous and asynhronous), whih deal with the spatial length as a well de(cid:28)ned

9

physial quantity, beome meaningless.

It is lear from the disussion in Ses. 2 and 2.1 that

omparison of only spatial (or temporal) parts of the omponents of the distane 4-vetor la
S and S′

AB in

is physially meaningless in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) sine some omponents of a 4D tensor

quantity, when they are taken alone, do not atual ly represent any 4D physial quantity. Also we

remark that the whole tensor quantity la
AB omprising omponents and the basis is transformed by
the Lorentz transformation from S to S′. This disussion shows that the asynhronous formulation

of SR also belongs to the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17)

The next de(cid:28)nition whih will be examined is the relativisti (or radar) length [19℄. (One an

speak about the radar formulation of SR.) It is assumed in [19℄ that the relativisti length (the

length of a fast-moving rod) is de(cid:28)ned as (the third artile in [19℄): (cid:17)the half-sum of distanes

overed by a light signal in diret and opposite diretions along the rod.(cid:17)

In the 4D spaetime

Strel'tsov de(cid:28)nes the 4-vetor of relativisti length lµ

rel (atually this length is not the 4-vetor but

it is the omponent form in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization of a 4-vetor) as: (cid:17)the half-di(cid:27)erene of two

d and lµ

b = (cL0/c, −L0, 0, 0), while in S′, where the rod is moving, they are lµ

light 4-vetors (i.e., the omponent form) lµ
b whih desribe the orresponding proesses of
light propagation (in the diret and opposite diretions).(cid:17) Then ,in S, the rest frame of the rod,
lµ
d = (cL0/c, L0, 0, 0) and lµ
d =
(cγL0(1+β)/c), γL0(1+β), 0, 0), and lµ
b = (cγL0(1−β)/c), −γL0(1−β), 0, 0). Thene in S one (cid:28)nds
b )/2 = (0, L0, 0, 0) and in S′
lµ
rel = (lµ
is lµ
ompares only the spatial parts of lµ
rel ≡ l1′
l′
quantities l1′

rel = (γβL0, γL0, 0, 0). Now Strel'tsov, in the similar way as in the asynhronous de(cid:28)nition,

rel are onsidered to be the same quantity for observers in S′

rel and de(cid:28)nes that the relativisti length in S′

rel in S by the (cid:17)elongation formula(cid:17) l′

rel, whih is related with lrel ≡ l1

rel = γlrel. These
and in S. It

′

′

is

is argued in [19℄ that suh (cid:17)approah has a manifestly relativisti ovariant harater.(cid:17) But, as

already said, the formulation of SR with true tensors (or the CBGQs), i.e., the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17)

shows that omparison of only spatial (or temporal) parts of the omponents of the distane 4-

AB in S and S′

vetor la
observers in S′

is physially meaningless. Thus l1′

rel and l1

rel are not the same quantity for
and in S. In general, as an be onluded from the preeding setions, the spatial

or temporal distanes are not well de(cid:28)ned physial quantities in 4D spaetime. Consequently the

radar formulation of SR, together with the asynhronous formulation and Einstein's formulation

of SR, belongs to the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) Having disussed di(cid:27)erent theoretial formulations of SR we

an go to the omparison with experiments.

3 THE COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

In numerous papers and textbooks it is onsidered that the experiments on (cid:17)length ontration(cid:17)

and (cid:17)time dilatation(cid:17) test SR, but the disussion from the previous setions shows that suh an

interpretation of the experiments refers exlusively to the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) and not to the (cid:17)TT

relativity.(cid:17) We have shown that when SR is understood as the theory of 4D spaetime with

pseudo-Eulidean geometry then instead of the Lorentz ontration and the dilatation of time one

has to onsider the 4D tensor quantities, the spaetime length l (10), or the distane 4-vetor
AB = xa
la
A. Namely in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the measurements in di(cid:27)erent IFRs (and di(cid:27)erent

B − xa

oordinatizations) have to refer to the same 4D tensor quantity, i.e., to a CBGQ, (of ourse the

same holds for the theory). In the hosen IFR and the hosen oordinatization (this hoie de(cid:28)nes

what are the basis 4-vetors and 1-forms) the measurement of some 4D quantity has to ontain

the measurements of all parts (all the basis omponents) of suh a quantity. However in almost all

experiments that refer to SR only the quantities belonging to the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) were measured.

From the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint suh measurements are inomplete, sine only some parts of a

4D quantity, not all, are measured. This fat presents a serious di(cid:30)ulty in the reliable omparison

of the existing experiments with the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) and, atually, we shall be able to ompare

in a quantitative manner only some of the existing experiments with the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) This

will be examined in the omparison of the theoretial results for the spaetime length in the

(cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and the spatial and temporal distanes in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) with the existing

experiments (see also [16℄). We note that di(cid:27)erent test theories of SR have been proposed (see,

e.g., [12℄ and referenes therein), but ultimately all of them use the time dilatation and length

10

ontration parameters. (For example, even in the reent test theory [20℄ whih poses the question

[20℄: (cid:17).. how aurately the bakground spaetime of physial phenomena, at least loally, is a

Minkowski spaetime?(cid:17) the authors states in the abstrat: (cid:17)It is shown that the time dilatation

and length ontration parameters measure the deviation from a Riemannian geometry.(cid:17) Thene

all of the existing test theories are not atually test theories of SR, but test theories of the usual (cid:17)AT

relativity(cid:17) approah to SR. Our aim in the following setions, whih deal with the omparison with

experiments, is not the omparison of some test theories with experiments, but the omparison of

the existing experimental results with di(cid:27)erent theoretial approahes to SR, i.e., with the usual

(cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) It will be shown that the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) theoretial results

agree with all experiments that are omplete from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint, i.e., in whih

all parts of the onsidered tensor quantity are measured in the experiment. However the (cid:17)AT

relativity(cid:17) results agree only with some of the examined experiments and this agreement will exist

only for the spei(cid:28) oordinatization, i.e., the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization.

4 THE (cid:17)MUON(cid:17) EXPERIMENT

First we shall examine an experiment in whih di(cid:27)erent results will be predited for di(cid:27)erent

synhronizations in the onventional approah to SR, i.e., in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) but of ourse the

same results for all synhronizations will be obtained in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) This is the (cid:17)muon(cid:17)

experiment, whih is theoretially disussed in Ses. 2.1 and 2.2. The (cid:17)muon(cid:17) experiment is quoted

in almost every textbook on general physis, see, e.g., [21℄ and [22℄. Moreover, an experiment [23℄

was the basis for a (cid:28)lm often shown in introdutory modern physis ourses: (cid:17)Time dilation: An

experiment with µ mesons.(cid:17)

In these experiments [23℄ (see also [24℄) the (cid:29)uxes of muons on a mountain, Nm , and at sea
level, Ns , are measured, and the number of muons whih deayed in (cid:29)ight is determined from their

di(cid:27)erene. Also the distribution of the deay times is measured for the ase when the muons are at

rest, giving a lifetime τ of approximately 2.2µs. The rate of deay of muons at rest, i.e., in the muon

frame, is ompared with their rate of deay in (cid:29)ight, i.e., in the Earth frame. In [23℄ high-veloity

muons are used, whih auses that the frational energy loss of the muons in the atmosphere is

negligible, making it a onstant veloity problem. The disussion of the (cid:17)muon(cid:17) experiment in Ses.

2.1 and 2.2 referred to the deay of only one partile. When the real experiments are onsidered,

as in [23℄, then we use data on the deay of many suh radioative partiles and the harateristi

quantities are avareged over many single deay events.

4.1 The nonrelativisti approah

In the nonrelativisti theory the spae and time are separated. The oordinate transformations

onneting the Earth frame and the muon frame are the Galilean transformations giving that tE ,

the travel time from the mountain to sea level when measured in the Earth frame, is the same

as tµ , whih is the elapsed time for the same travelling but measured in the moving frame of
the muon, tE = tµ . Also, in the nonrelativisti theory, the lifetimes of muons in the mentioned
two frames are equal, τE = τµ = τ. Muon ounts on the mountain Nm, and at sea level Ns, as

experimentally determined numbers, do not depend on the frame in whih they are measured and

on the hosen oordinatization. This result, i.e., that Nsµ=NsE = Ns and Nmµ = NmE = Nm,

has to be obtained not only in the nonrelativisti theory but also in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and in the

(cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) The di(cid:27)erential equation for the radiotive-deay proesses in the nonrelativisti

theory an be written as

dN/dt = −λN, Ns = Nm exp(−t/τ ).

(19)

The travel time tE is not diretly measured by loks, but, in the Earth frame, it is determined
as the ratio of the height of the mountain HE and the veloity of the muons v , tE = HE/v.

The equation (19) holds in the Earth frame and in the muon frame too, sine the two frames are

onneted by the Galilean transformations, and, as mentioned above, the orresponding times are

equal, tE = tµ and τE = τµ. Hene we onlude that in the nonrelativisti theory the exponential

fators are the same in both frames and onsequently the orresponding (cid:29)uxes in the two frames

are equal, Nsµ=NsE and Nmµ = NmE , as it must be. However the experiments show that the

11

atual (cid:29)ux at sea level is muh higher than that expeted from suh a nonrelativisti alulation,

and thus the nonrelativisti theory does not agree with the experimental results.

4.2 The usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) approah

In the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) di(cid:27)erent physial phenomena in di(cid:27)erent IFRs must be invoked to explain

the measured values of the (cid:29)uxes; the time (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) is used in the Earth frame, but in the muon

frame one explains the data by means of the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration.(cid:17) In order to exploit the results

of Ses. 2.1 and 2.2 we analyse the (cid:17)muon(cid:17) experiment not only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization but

also in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization. As shown in Se. 2.2 the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) onsiders that the spatial

and temporal parts of the spaetime length are well-de(cid:28)ned physial quantities in 4D spaetime.

Then, as in the nonrelativisti theory, the equation for the radioative-deay in the (cid:17)AT rela-

tivity(cid:17) an be written as

dN/dx0 = −λN, Ns = Nm exp(−λx0).

(20)

The equation (20) ontains a spei(cid:28) oordinate, the x0

oordinate, whih means that the equation

(20) will not remain unhanged upon the Lorentz transformation, i.e., it will not have the same

form in di(cid:27)erent IFRs (and also in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations). But in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) it is

not required that the physial quantities must be the 4D tensor quantities that orretly transform

upon the Lorentz transformations. Thus the quantities in (20) are not the 4D tensor quantities, i.e.,

they are not the true tensors or the CBGQs. This will ause that di(cid:27)erent phenomena in di(cid:27)erent

IFRs will need to be invoked to explain the same physial e(cid:27)et, i.e., the same experimental

data.

In the Earth frame and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization we an write in (20) that x0
E = ctE,
λE = 1/cτE, whih gives that the radioative-deay law beomes NsE = NmE exp(−tE/τE). In the
experiments [23℄ NsE, NmE, and tE = HE/v are measured in the Earth frame (taitly assuming

the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization). However the lifetime of muons is measured in their rest frame. Now,

in ontrast to the nonrelativisti theory where τE = τµ and tE = tµ, the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) assumes

that in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization there is the time (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) determined by (17), whih gives the

onnetion between the lifetimes of muons in the Earth frame τE and the measured lifetime in the
muon frame τµ as

τE = γτµ.

Using that relation one (cid:28)nds that the radioative-deay law, when expressed in terms of the mea-

sured quantities, beomes

NsE = NmE exp(−tE/τE) = NmE exp(−tE/γτµ).

(21)

(22)

This equation is used in [23℄ to make the (cid:17)relativisti(cid:17) alulation and ompare it with the experi-

mental data. In fat, in [23℄, the omparison is made between the predited time dilatation fator

γ of the muons and an observed γ. The predited γ is 8.4 ± 2, while the observed γ is found to be
8.8 ± 0.8, whih is a onvining agreement. The predition of γ is made from the measured ener-

gies of muons on the mountain and at sea level; these energies are determined from the measured

amount of material whih muons penetrated when stopped, and then the energies are onverted to

the speeds of the muons using the relativisti relation between the total energy and the speed. The

observed γ is determined from the relation (22), where the measured rates were NsE = 397 ± 9 and
NmE = 550 ± 10, and the measured height of the mountain is HE = 1907m. The lifetime of muons
τµ in the muon frame is taken as the information from other experiments (in order to obtain more
aurate result) and it is τµ = 2.211 · 10−6s.

Let us now see how the experiments are interpreted in the muon frame. (We note that [23℄

ompared the theory (the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)) and the experiments only in the Earth frame, but using τµ

from the muon frame.) First we have to (cid:28)nd the form of the law for the radioative-deay proesses

(20) in the muon frame. As onsidered above the radioative-deay law NsE = NmE exp(−tE/τE)

in the Earth frame and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization is obtained from the equation (20) using the

relations x0

E = ctE and λE = 1/cτE. But, as already said, the equation (20) does not remain

unhanged upon the Lorentz transformation. Aordingly it annot have the same form in the

Earth frame and in the muon frame. So, atually, in the 4D spaetime, the equation for the

12

radioative-deay proesses in the muon frame ould have, in priniple, a di(cid:27)erent funtional form

than the equation (22), whih desribes the same radioative- deay proesses in the Earth frame.

However, in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) despite of the fat that the quantities in the Earth frame and in the

muon frame are not onneted by the Lorentz transformations, the equation for the radioative-

deay proesses in the muon frame is obtained from the equation (20) in the same way as in the

Earth frame, i.e., writting that x0

µ = ctµ, and λµ = 1/cτµ, whene

Nsµ = Nmµ exp(−tµ/τµ).

(23)

The justi(cid:28)ation for suh a proedure an be done in the following way. In the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) the

priniple of relativity ats as some sort of (cid:17)Deus ex mahina,(cid:17) whih resolves problems; the relation

(20) is prolaimed to be the physial law and the priniple of relativity requires that a physial

law must have the same form in di(cid:27)erent IFRs. (This is the usual way in whih the priniple

of relativity is understood in the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17)) Therefore, one an write in the equation (20)

that x0

E = ctE and λE = 1/cτE in the Earth frame and x0

µ = ctµ, and λµ = 1/cτµ in the muon

frame. With suh substitutions the form of the law is the same in both frames, as it is required by

the priniple of relativity. Then, as we have already seen, when the onsideration is done in the

Earth frame, the relation (21) for the time dilatation is used to onnet quantities in two frames,

instead of to onnet them by the Lorentz transformations. When the onsideration is performed

in the muon frame another relation is invoked to onnet quantities in two frames. Namely it is

onsidered in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) that in the muon frame the mountain is moving and the muon

(cid:17)sees(cid:17) the height of the mountain Lorentz ontrated,

whih is Eq. (14) for the Lorentz ontration, giving that

Hµ = HE/γ,

tµ = Hµ/v = HE/γv = tE/γ.

(24)

(25)

This leads to the same exponential fator in (23) as that one in the Earth frame in (22), exp(−tµ/τµ) =
exp(−tE/(γτµ)). From that result it is onluded that in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)
oordinatization the orresponding (cid:29)uxes are equal in the two frames, Nsµ=NsE = Ns and
Nmµ = NmE = Nm. Stritly speaking, it is not the mentioned equality of (cid:29)uxes, but the equality of
ratios of (cid:29)uxes, NsE/NmE = Nsµ/Nmµ , whih follows from the equality of the exponential fators
in (22) and (23). In [23℄ the time tµ that the muons spent in (cid:29)ight aording to their own loks

was inferred from the measured distribution of deay times of muons at rest. Sine the predited

(cid:29)uxes NsE and NmE are in a satisfatory agreement with the measured ones, and sine the theory

(whih deals with the time dilatation and the Lorentz ontration) predits their independene on

the hosen frame, it is generally aepted that the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) orretly explains the measured

data.

The above omparison is worked out only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, but the physis demands

that the independene of the (cid:29)uxes on the hosen frame must hold in all permissible oordinatiza-

tions. Therefore we now disuss the experiments [23℄ from the point of view of the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)

but in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization. Then, using (20), we an write the relation for the (cid:29)uxes in the (cid:17)r(cid:17)

oordinatization and in the Earth frame as

Nr,sE = Nr,mE exp(−λr,Ex0

r,E) = Nr,mE exp(−x0

r,E/x0

r,E(τE)),

where x0
the Earth frame in terms of the measured quantity x0

r,E(τE) = 1/λr,E. Again, as in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, we have to express x0

r,E(τE) in
r,µ(τµ) using the relation (18) for the time

(cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization,

r,E(τE) = (1 + 2βr)1/2cτµ.
x0

Hene, the radioative-deay law (20), in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, and when expressed in terms of

the measured quantities, beomes

Nr,sE = Nr,mE exp(−x0

r,E/(1 + 2βr)1/2cτµ),

(26)

13

and it orresponds to the relation (22) in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. If we express βr in terms of β =
v/c as βr = β/(1−β) (see (7)) and use (6) to onnet the (cid:17)r(cid:17) and (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatizations, x0
E −
x1
E = ctE−HE, then the exponential fator in (26) beomes = exp n−(ctE − HE)/ [(1 + β)/(1 − β)]
Using HE = vtE this exponential fator an be written in the form that resembles to that one in
(22), i.e., it is = exp(−tE/ΓrEτµ), and (26) an be written as

r,E = x0

1/2

cτµo .

Nr,sE = Nr,mE exp(−tE/ΓrEτµ).

We see that γ = (1 − β)−1/2

in (22) (the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) is replaed by a di(cid:27)erent fator

ΓrE = (1 + β)1/2(1 − β)

−3/2 = (1 + β)(1 − β)

−1γ

in (27) (the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization). The observed ΓrE in the experiments [23℄ must remain the
same, the observed ΓrE = 8.8 ± 0.8, (it is determined from (27) with the measured values of
Nr,sE, Nr,mE, tE and τµ ), but the predited ΓrE, using the above relation for Γr and the known,
predited, γ = 8.4 ± 2, beomes ≃ 250γ,

(27)

(28)

(29)

ΓrE ≃ 250γ.

We see that from the ommon point of view a quite unexpeted result is obtained in the (cid:17)r(cid:17)

oordinatization; the observed ΓrE is as before = 8.8, while the predited ΓrE is ≃ 250 · 8.4 = 2100.

Similarly, one an show that there is a great disrepany between the (cid:29)uxes measured in [23℄ and the

(cid:29)uxes predited when the (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) of time is taken into aount but in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization

and all is in the Earth frame. Furthermore, it an be easily proved that predited values in the

(cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization and in the muon frame will again greatly di(cid:27)er from the measured ones. Suh

results expliitly show that the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) is not a satisfatory relativisti theory; it predits,

e.g., di(cid:27)erent values of the (cid:29)ux Ns (for the same measured Nm) in di(cid:27)erent synhronizations

and for some synhronizations these predited values are quite di(cid:27)erent but the measured ones.

These results are diretly ontrary to the generally aepted opinion about the validity of the (cid:17)AT

relativity.(cid:17)

4.3 The (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) approah

Let us now examine the experiments [23℄ from the point of view of the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) In the (cid:17)TT

relativity(cid:17) all quantities entering into physial laws must be 4D tensor quantities, and thus with

orret transformation properties; the same 4D quantity has to be onsidered in di(cid:27)erent IFRs and

di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations. In the usual, (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) analysis of the (cid:17)muon(cid:17) experiment, for

example, the lifetimes τE and τµ are onsidered as the same quantity. Although the transformation
onneting τE and τµ (the dilatation of time (21)) is only a part of the Lorentz transformation
written in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, it is believed by all proponents of the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) that τE
and τµ refer to the same temporal distane (the same quantity) but measured by the observers in

two relatively moving IFRs. However, as shown in the preeding setions and in [1℄ (see Fig.4),

in 4D spaetime τE and τµ refer to di(cid:27)erent quantities, whih are not onneted by the Lorentz
transformation. To paraphrase Gamba [7℄: (cid:17)As far as relativity is onerned, quantities like τE
and τµ are di(cid:27)erent quantities, not neessarily related to one another. To ask the relation between
τE and τµ from the point of view of relativity, is like asking what is the relation between the
measurement of the radius of the Earth made by an observer S and the measurement of the radius
of Venus made by an observer S′. We an ertainly take the ratio of the two measures; what is

wrong is the tait assumption that relativity has something to do with the problem just beause

the measurements were made by two observers.(cid:17)

spei(cid:28) oordinate, x0

quantities, i.e., the CBGQs, as

Hene, in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) instead of the equation (20), whih expliitly ontains only the

oordinate, we formulate the radioative-deay law in terms of true tensor

dN/dl = −λN, N = N0 exp(−λl).

(30)

l is the spaetime length de(cid:28)ned by (10), where la(lb) is the distane 4-vetor between two events

muons (here on the mountain; we denote it as the event O) and their arrival (here at sea level;
the event A). λ = 1/l(τ ); l(τ ) is the spaetime length for the events of reation of muons (here
l, de(cid:28)ned in
on the mountain; the event O) and their deay after the lifetime τ, the event T .

suh a way, is a geometrial quantity. Then in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and in the muon frame the

OA, when written as the CBGQ, beomes la

µ)1/2. The distane 4-vetor la

µ,OT lµ,βOT )1/2 = (−c2τ 2

(30) we (cid:28)nd the expression for the radioative-deay law in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

Ns = Nm exp(−lOA/lOT ),

(31)

(32)

whih in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and in the muon frame takes the same form as the relation (23)

(the radioative-deay law in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and in the muon frame),

Ns = Nm exp(−lOA/lOT ) = Nm exp(−tµ/τµ).

Sine the spaetime length l is independent on the hosen IFR and on the hosen oordinatization

the relation (31) holds in the same form in the Earth frame and in the muon frame and in both

oordinatizations, the (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatizations. Hene we do not need to examine Eq. (31)

in the Earth frame, and in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, but we an simply ompare the relation (32)

with the experiments. (The relation (11) gives the distane 4-vetors la
OT written as the
CBGQs in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization in the muon frame (the S frame) and in the Earth frame (the
S′

OA and la

frame) and similarly happens with Eq. (12) in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization.)

Thus we onlude that, in order to hek the validity of the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) in the (cid:17)muon(cid:17)

experiment, we would need, stritly speaking, to measure, e.g., the lifetime τµ and the time tµ in
the muon frame, where they determine lOT and lOA respetively, and then to measure the same
events (that determined τµ and tµ in the muon frame) in an IFR that is in uniform motion relative

to the muon frame (at us it is the Earth frame). Of ourse it is not possible to do so in the real

(cid:17)muon(cid:17) experiment but, nevertheless, in this ase we an use the data from experiments [23℄ and

interpret them as that they were obtained in the way required by the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) The reasons

for suh a onlusion are the identity of miropartiles of the same sort, the assumed homogeneity

and isotropy of the spaetime, and some other reasons that are atually disussed in [23℄ (although

from another point of view). Here we shall not disuss this, in priniple, a very omplex question,

than we take the measured values of τµ, tµ, Ns and Nm and ompare them with the results predited
by the relation (32). In [23℄ τµ is taken to be τµ = 2.211µs, Ns = 397 ± 9, Nm = 550 ± 10, but tµ
is not measured than it is estimated from Fig. 6(a) in [23℄ to be tµ = 0.7µs. Inserting the values of
τµ, tµ and Nm from [23℄ (for this simple omparison we take only the mean values without errors)
into (32) we predit that Ns is Ns = 401, whih is in an exellent agreement with the measured
Ns = 397. As it is already said, the spaetime length l takes the same value in both frames and
both oordinatizations, le,µ = le,E = lr,µ = lr,E. Hene, for the measured Nm = 550 and if the
distane 4-vetors la
OT would be measured in the Earth frame, and in both frames in
the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, we would (cid:28)nd the same Ns = 401. This result undoubtedly on(cid:28)rms the

OA and la

onsisteny and the validity of the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17)

The nonrelativisti theory predits the same value of the exponential fator in both frames,

exp(−tE/τE) = exp(−tµ/τµ), sine it deals with the absolute time, i.e., with the Galilean trans-
formations. But, for the measured Nm the nonrelativisti theory predits too smal l Ns. The (cid:17)AT
relativity(cid:17) orretly predits the value of Ns in both frames but only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization,
while in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization the experimental Ns and the theoretial ly predited Ns drastial ly

di(cid:27)er. The (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) ompletely agrees with the experiments in al l IFRs and al l permissible o-

ordinatizations. Thus, the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) as the theory of 4D spaetime with the pseudo-Eulidean

geometry, is in a omplete agreement with the experiments.

15

4.4 Another time (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) experiments

The same onlusion an be ahieved omparing the other partile lifetime measurements, e.g., [25℄,

or for the pion lifetime [26℄, with all three theories. However, as it is already said, all the mentioned

experiments, and not only them but all other too, were designed to test the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) Thus

in the experiments [25℄, whih preeded to the experiments [23℄ and [24℄, the relation similar to

(22) is used but with tE replaed by HE (=vtE ) and τE (the lifetime of muons in the Earth frame)
replaed by L = vτE (L is the (cid:17)average range before deay(cid:17)), and also the onnetion between the
lifetimes (21) (τE = γτµ ) is employed. Obviously the preditions of the results in the experiments

[25℄ will depend on the hosen synhronization, sine they deal with the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and use

the radioative-deay law in the form that ontains only a part of the distane 4-vetor. The

preditions obtained by the use of the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) will be again independent on the hosen IFR

and the hosen oordinatization. However the omparison of these experiments [25℄ with the (cid:17)TT

relativity(cid:17) is di(cid:30)ult sine, e.g., they have no data for tµ. Similarly happens with the experiments

reported in [26℄.

The lifetime measurements of muons in the g-2 experiments [27℄ are often quoted as the most

onvining evidene for the time dilatation, i.e., they are laimed as high-preision evidene for

SR. Namely in the literature the evidene for the time dilatation is ommonly onsidered as the

evidene for SR. The muon lifetime in (cid:29)ight τ is determined by (cid:28)tting the experimental deay

eletron time distribution to the six-parameter phenomenologial funtion desribing the normal

modulated exponential deay spetrum (their Eq.(1)). Then by the use of the relation τ = γτ0
and of τ0 (our τµ ), the lifetime at rest (as determined by other workers), they obtained the time-
dilatation fator γ, or the kinematial γ. This γ is ompared with the orresponding dynamial γ
fator (γ = (p/m)dp/dE ), whih they alled γ (the average γ value). γ is determined from the
mean rotation frequeny f rot by the use of the Lorentz fore law (the (cid:17)relativisti(cid:17) expression);
the magneti (cid:28)eld was measured in terms of the proton NMR frequeny fp (for the disussion of
g − 2 experiments within the traditional (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) see also [28℄). Limits of order 10−3
(γ − γ)/γ at the kinematial γ = 29.3 were set.
lifetime at rest τ +
the µ+
0 = (2 ± 9) × 10−4, (this is the same omparison as
experiment τ +/γ, and obtained (τ +
the mentioned omparison of γ with γ ). They laimed: (cid:17)At 95% on(cid:28)dene the frational di(cid:27)erene
between τ +

0 and τ +/γ is in the range (−1.6 − 2.0) × 10−3

0 (from the other preise measurements) with the value found in their

0 − τ +/γ)/τ +

In that way they also ompared the value of

.(cid:17) and (cid:17)To date, this is the most aurate

in

test of relativisti time dilation using elementary partiles.(cid:17) The ob jetions to the preision of the

experiments [27℄, and the remark that a onvining diret test of SR must not assume the validity

of SR in advane (in the use of the (cid:17)relativisti(cid:17) Lorentz fore law in the determination of the

mean rotation frequeny and thus of γ, and τ0 ), have been raised in [29℄. The disussion of these

ob jetions is given in [30℄.

However, our ob jetions to [27℄ are of a quite di(cid:27)erent nature. Firstly, the theoretial relations

refer to the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and, e.g., Eq.(1) in the (cid:28)rst paper in [27℄ annot be transformed in

an appropriate way to the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization in order to ompare the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) in di(cid:27)erent

oordinatizations with the experiments.

If only the exponential fator is onsidered then this

fator is again, as in [23℄, a(cid:27)eted by synhrony hoie. Although the time t in that exponential
fator may be independent of the hosen synhronization (when t is taken to be the multiple of
the mean rotation period T ), but τ does not refer to the events that happen at the same spatial

point and thus it is synhrony dependent quantity. This means that in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization

one annot use the relation τ = γτ0 to (cid:28)nd the (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) fator γ, but the relation (18) for the
time (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, x0
r(τ ) = (1 + 2βr)1/2cτ0 must be employed. Hene, the
whole omparison of γ with γ holds only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization; in another oordinatization the
(cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) predits quite di(cid:27)erent τ0 for the same x0(τ ) (that is inferred from the exponential

deay spetrum).

Let us now examine the measurements [27℄ from the point of view of the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) But

for the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) these experiments are inomplete and annot be ompared with the theory.

Namely, in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) as already said, it is not possible to (cid:28)nd the values of the muon

lifetime in (cid:29)ight τ by analyses of the measurements of the radioative deay distribution, sine,
there, the radioative deay law is written in terms of the spaetime lengths and not with t and
τ. Also, in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) there is not the onnetion between the muon lifetime in (cid:29)ight τ

16

and the lifetime at rest τ0 in the form τ = γτ0, sine τ, in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) does not exist as

a well de(cid:28)ned quantity. Thus, in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) there is no sense in the use of the relation

τ = γτ0 to determine γ. An important remark is in plae here; in priniple, in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17)

the same events and the same quantities have to be onsidered in di(cid:27)erent frames of referene.

This means that in the muon experiment [27℄ the lifetime at rest τ0 refers to the deaying partile

in an aelerated frame and for the theoretial disussion we would need to use the oordinate

transformations onneting an IFR with an aelerated frame of referene. (An example of the

generalized Lorentz transformation is given in [31℄ but they are written in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization

and thus not in fully ovariant way, i.e., not in the way as we have written the ovariant Lorentz

transformation (1).) Furthermore, in the experiments [27℄ the average value of γ (γ ), i.e., the
dynamial γ, for the irulating muons is found by analysis of the bunh struture of the stored
muon and the use of the relation onneting γ and the mean rotation frequeny f rot. This relation

is obtained by the use of the expression for the (cid:17)relativisti,(cid:17) i.e., the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) Lorentz

fore law, whih is expressed by means of the 3-vetors

and

E

B. However, in ontrast to the (cid:17)AT

relativity,(cid:17) and also to the usual ovariant formulation, in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) the Lorentz fore as

the true tensor K a = (q/c)F abub (F ab
a harge q , see [8℄, [32℄ and [1℄) annot be expressed in terms of the 3-vetors

that the measurements [27℄ annot be ompared with the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) But, as we explained

before, in ontrast to the usual opinion, these experiments do not on(cid:28)rm the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)

either. Namely if the exponential deay spetrum is analyzed in another oordinatization, e.g., the

(cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, then, similarly as for the experiments [23℄, one (cid:28)nds that for the given N0 the
theoretial and the experimental N di(cid:27)er.

5 THE MICHELSON-MORLEY EXPERIMENT

These onlusions will be further supported onsidering some other experiments, whih, ustomar-

ily, were assumed to on(cid:28)rm the usual (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) that is, the Einstein formulation of SR. The

(cid:28)rst one will be the famous Mihelson-Morley experiment [34℄, and some modern versions of this

experiment will be also disussed. Sine the Mihelson-Morley experiment is onsidered in detail

in [2℄ we only brie(cid:29)y disuss some results.

In the Mihelson-Morley experiment two light beams emitted by one soure are sent, by half-

silvered mirror O, in orthogonal diretions. These partial beams of light traverse the two equal (of
the length L) and perpendiular arms OM1 (perpendiular to the motion) and OM2 (in the line

of motion) of Mihelson's inteferometer and the behaviour of the interferene fringes produed on

bringing together these two beams after re(cid:29)etion on the mirrors M1 and M2 is examined. In order

to avoid the in(cid:29)uene of the e(cid:27)et that the two lengths of arms are not exatly equal the entire

17

inteferometer is rotated through 900. Then any small di(cid:27)erene in length beomes unimportant.

The experiment onsists of looking for a shift of the intereferene fringes as the apparatus is rotated.

The expeted maximum shift in the number of fringes (the measured quantity) on a 900

rotation

is

△ N = △(φ2 − φ1)/2π,

(33)

where △(φ2 − φ1) is the hange in the phase di(cid:27)erene when the interferometer is rotated through
900. φ1 and φ2 are the phases of waves moving along the paths OM1O and OM2O, respetively.

5.1 The (cid:17)TT relativity (cid:17) approah

The Mihelson-Morley experiment will be examined from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint and then

it will be shown how the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) results are obtained. The relevant quantity is the

phase of a light wave, and it is (when written in the abstrat index notation)

φ = kagablb,

(34)

(35)

′

(36)

where ka

is the propagation 4-vetor, gab is the metri tensor and lb

is the distane 4-vetor. All

quantities in (34) are true tensor quantities. As disussed in Se. 2 these quantities an be written

in the oordinate-based geometri language and, e.g., the deompositions of ka

in S and S′

and in

the (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatizations are

eµ′ = kµeµ = kµ

r rµ′ = kµ

r rµ,

where the basis omponents kµ
ν,e)−1 = Lµ
(2), while the basis vetors eµ are transformed by the inverse transformation (Lµ
Similarly holds for the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization where the Lorentz transformation Lµ
ν,r (7) has to be
used. By the same reasoning the phase φ (34) is given in the oordinate-based geometri language

tries, and hene gµν,e = gµ′ν′,e , gµν,r = gµ′ν′,r , what is already taken into aount in (36).) The
traditional derivation of △N (see [2℄ and, e.g., [21℄, [22℄, or an often ited paper on modern tests of
2 in S′, but does
speial relativity [35℄) deals only with the alulation of t1 and t2 in S and t′

1 and t′

not take into aount either the hanges in frequenies due to the Doppler e(cid:27)et or the aberration

of light. (The Earth frame is the rest frame of the interferometer, i.e., it is the S frame, while
the S′
v. In the S
frame t1 and t2 are the times required for the omplete trips OM1O and OM2O respetively, while
2 are the orresponding times in S′.) The (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulations [36℄ and [37℄ improve

t′

frame is the (preferred) frame in whih the interferometer is moving at veloity

the traditional proedure taking into aount the hanges in frequenies [36℄ and the aberration

of light [37℄. But all these approahes explain the experiments using the AT, the Lorentz ontra-

tion and the time dilatation, and furthermore they always work only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization.

None of the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulations deal with the true tensors or with the CBGQs (omprising

both omponents and a basis). In this ase suh 4D tensor quantity is the phase (34) or (36).

In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) approah to SR neither the Doppler e(cid:27)et nor the aberration of light exist

separately as wel l de(cid:28)ned physial phenomena. The separate ontributions to φ (34), or (36), of
the ωt (i.e., k0l0 ) fator [36℄ and
(i.e., kili ) fator [37℄ are, in general ase, meaningless in
the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) From the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint only their indivisible unity, the phase φ
(34), or (36), is a orretly de(cid:28)ned 4D quantity. All quantities in (34), i.e., ka
and φ, are

, gab, lb

kl

the true tensor quantities, whih means that in all relatively moving IFRs and in all permissible

oordinatizations always the same 4D quantity, e.g., ka, or lb, or φ, is onsidered. (Eq. (36) shows
it for φ.) This is not the ase in the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) There, for example, the relation for the time
dilatation t′
1 = γt1, whih is used in the usual explanation (see, e.g., [21℄, [22℄ and [35℄) of the
Mihelson-Morley experiment, is not the Lorentz transformation of some 4D quantity, and t′
1 and
t1 do not orrespond to the same 4D quantity onsidered in S′
and S respetively but to di(cid:27)erent
4D quantities, as an be learly seen from Se. 2.2 (see 17). Only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization the ωt

kl

and

fators an be onsidered separately. Therefore, and in order to retain the similarity with

18

the prerelativisti and the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) onsiderations, we (cid:28)rst determine φ (34), (36), in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)
oordinatization and in the S frame (the rest frame of the interferometer). This means that φ will
e gµν,e lν
be alulated from (36) as the CBGQ φ = kµ

Let now A, B and A1 denote the events; the departure of the transverse ray from the half-
silvered mirror O, the re(cid:29)etion of this ray on the mirror M1 and the arrival of this beam of light
after the round trip on the half-silvered mirror O, respetively.

notation we omit the subsript 'e' in all quantities. Then kµ

AB in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and in S ) for the wave on the trip OM1 (the events

is usually a few wavelengths (≺ 25) and is essential for obtaining useful interferene fringes.(cid:17) L, L
and ν are determined in S , the rest frame of the interferometer. Using the Lorentz transformation

Then it an be easily shown that φ′

these quantities an be determined in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization and in S′

in aordane with (36). Note that gµν,r (4) from Se. 2 has to be used in the alulation of φ in the
(cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization. As an example we quote kµ
AB,r = ((ω/c) − 2π/λ, 0, 2π/λ, 0)

φ1 − φ2 = −2ω(tM1 − tM2 ) + 2(2π/λ)(L − L).

Partiularly for L = L, and onsequently tM1 = tM2 , one (cid:28)nds φ1 − φ2 = 0. It an be easily

shown that the same di(cid:27)erene of phase (39) is obtained in the ase when the interferometer

is rotated through 900, whene we (cid:28)nd that △(φ1 − φ2) = 0, and △N = 0. Aording to the
onstrution φ (34), or (36), is a frame independent quantity and it also does not depend on the

hosen oordinatization in a onsidered IFR. Thus we onlude that

This result is in a omplete agreement with the Mihelson-Morley [34℄ experiment.

Drisoll [36℄ improved the traditional (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) derivation of the fringe shift taking into

aount the hanges in frequenies due to the Doppler e(cid:27)et. This improvement resulted in a

1)/2π = 4(Lν/c)β2,

(41)

and we see that the entire fringe shift is due to the Doppler shift (see [36℄ and [2℄). It is expliitly

shown in [2℄ that Drisoll's result an be easily obtained from our (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) approah taking

only the produt k0′

e l0′e in the alulation of the inrement of phase φ′

e in S′

in whih the apparatus

is moving.

We remark that the non-null fringe shift (41) would be quite di(cid:27)erent in another oordinatiza-

tion, e.g., in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, sine only a part k0′
e l0′e of the whole 4D tensor quantity φ
(34) or (36) is onsidered. Thus when only a part of the whole phase φ (34) or (36) is taken into

aount then it leads to an unphysial result.

As shown in [2℄ the same alulation of ki

li′, the ontribution of the spatial parts of kµ

and lµ′

′

′

e, shows that this term exatly anel the k0′

to △N ′
(41)), yielding that △N ′

l0′

e = △Ne = 0. Thus the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)approah to SR naturally explains

ontribution (Drisol l's non-nul l fringe shift

the reason for the existene of Drisoll's non-null fringe shift (41).

The results of the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation an be easily explained from our true tensor

formulation of SR taking only the part k0
of the inrement of phase φ′
onsiders the part k0
e l0′e in S′
and k0
Thus the inrement of phase φ1 for the round trip OM1O in S , is

e l0′e of the whole phase φ (34) or (36) in the alulation
e in S′. In ontrast to Drisoll's treatment the traditional analysis
e l0e (of the whole phase φ (34), (36)) in S, the rest frame of the interferometer,
e is not hanged in transition from S to S′

φ

AB l0′AB + k0

BA1 l0′BA1 = −2(ω/c)(γctM1) = −2ω(γtM1).

This is exatly the result obtained in the traditional analysis (see [21℄ or [22℄) whih is inerpreted

1 = γt1 . In the same way we (cid:28)nd that the inrement of phase

as that there is a time (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) t′
φ2 for the round trip OM2O in S , is

CA2l0′CA2 = −2(ω/c)(γctM2) = −2ω(γtM2).

This is again the result of the traditional analysis, the time (cid:17)dilatation,(cid:17) t′
2 = γt2 . For t1 = t2 ,
i.e., for L = L, one (cid:28)nally (cid:28)nds the null fringe shift that is obtained in the traditional analysis
△N ′
e = △Ne = 0. We see that suh a nul l fringe shift is obtained taking into aount only a part of
the whole phase φ (34) or (36), and additional ly, in that part, k0
e is not hanged in transition from
S to S′
. Obviously this orret result follows from a physially inorret treatment of the phase φ

(34) or (36). Furthermore it has to be noted that the usual alulation is always done only in the

(cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization.

Sine only the part k0

e l0e of the whole phase φ (34) or (36) is taken into aount (and also
e ) the results of the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation are oordinatization dependent. We

k0′
e = k0

expliitly show it using the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization.

In the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization the inrement of phase φr is alulated from φr = k0

and from φ′

r = k0

r g00,r l0′

r in S′. Hene we (cid:28)nd that φ1r for the round trip OM1O in S is

r g00,r l0

r in S

and φ2r for the round trip OM2O in S is

φ1r = −2(ωtM1 + (2π/λ)L),

φ2r = −2(ωtM2 + (2π/λ)L).

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

For L = L, and onsequently tM1 = tM2 , we (cid:28)nd that φ1r −φ2r = 0, whene △Nr = 0. Remark that
the phases φ1r and φ2r di(cid:27)er from the orresponding phases φ1e and φ2e in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization.
As shown above this is not the ase when the whole phase φ (34) or (36) is taken into aount.

However, in S′, we (cid:28)nd for the same trips that

Obviously φ′

1r − φ′

1r = −2(γωtM1(1 + β) + (2π/λ)L),
φ

φ

′
r 6= 0,

△ N

(48)

(49)

(50)

whih holds even in the ase when tM1 = tM2 . This result learly shows that the agreement between

the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation and the Mihelson-Morley experiment is only an (cid:17)apparent(cid:17)

agreement. It is ahieved by an inorret proedure and it holds only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization.

We also remark that the traditional analysis, i.e., the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) gives di(cid:27)erent values for the

phases, e.g., φ1e, φ′
1r, sine only a part of the whole phase φ (34) or (36) is onsidered.
These phases are frame and oordinatization dependent quantities. When the whole phase φ (34)

1e, φ1r and φ′

or (36) is taken into aount, i.e., in (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) al l the mentioned phases are exatly equal

quantities; they are the same, frame and oordinatization independent, quantity.

5.2 The modern laser versions

The modern laser versions of the Mihelson-Morley experiment, e.g., [38℄ and [39℄, are always

interpreted aording to the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) They rely on highly monohromati (maser) laser

frequeny metrology rather than optial interferometry; the measured quantity is not the maximum

shift in the number of fringes than a beat frequeny variation and the assoiated (maser) laser-

frequeny shift. In [38℄ the authors reorded the variations in beat frequeny between two optial

maser osillators when rotated through 900

in spae; the two maser avities are plaed orthogonally

on a rotating table and they an be onsidered as two light loks. It is stated in [38℄ that the highly

monohromati frequenies of masers; (cid:17)...allow very sensitive detetion of any hange in the round-

trip optial distane between two re(cid:29)eting surfaes.(cid:17) and that the omparison of the frequenies

of two masers allows: (cid:17)...a very preise examination of the isotropy of spae with respet to light

propagation.(cid:17) The result of this experiment was: (cid:17)... there was no relative variation in the maser

frequenies assoiated with orientation of the earth in spae greater than about 3 k/se.(cid:17) Similarly

[39℄ ompares the frequenies of a He-Ne laser loked to the resonant frequeny of a higly stable

Fabry-Perot avity (the meter-stik, i.e., (cid:17)etalon of length(cid:17)) and of a CH4 stabilized (cid:17)telesope-
laser(cid:17) frequeny referene system. The beat frequeny of the isolation laser (CH4 stabilized-laser)

with the avity-stabilized laser was the measured quantity; a beat frequeny variation is onsidered

when the diretion of the avity length is rotated. The authors of [39℄, in the same way as [38℄,

onsider their experiment as: (cid:17)isotropy of spae experiment.(cid:17) Namely it is stated in [39℄ that:

(cid:17)Rotation of the entire eletro-optial system maps any osmi diretional anisotropy of spae into

a orresponding frequeny variation.(cid:17) They found a null result, i.e., a frational length hange

of △l/l = (1.5 ± 2.5) × 10−15

(this is also the frational frequeny shift) in showing the isotropy

of spae; this result represented a 4000-fold improvement on the measurements [38℄. In [35℄ the

experiment [39℄ is quoted as the most preise repetition of the Mihelson-Morley experiment, and

it is asserted that the experiment [39℄ onstrained the two times, our t′
a frational error of 10−15

1 and t′
2 refer to the round-trips in two maser avities in

. The times t′

2 , to be equal within

1 and t′

[38℄, and to the round-trips in the Fabry-Perot avity in [39℄. These times are alulated in the

same way as in the Mihelson-Morley experiment.(see, for example, [35℄).

The above brief disussion of the experiments [38℄ and [39℄, and the previous analysis of the

usual, (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) alulation of t′

1 and t′

2 in the Mihelson-Morley experiment, suggest that

the same remarks as in the Mihelson-Morley experiment hold also for the experiments [38℄ and

[39℄. For example, the re(cid:29)etions of light in maser avities or in Fabry-Perot avity happen on

the moving mirrors as in the Mihelson-Morley experiment, whih means that the optial paths

between the re(cid:29)eting ends have to be alulated taking into aount the Doppler e(cid:27)et, i.e., as

21

in Drisoll's proedure [36℄. In fat, the interferene of the light waves, e.g., the light waves with

lose frequenies from two maser avities in [38℄, is always determined by their phase di(cid:27)erene

and not only with their frequenies. Also it has to be noted that the theoretial preditions for the

beat frequeny variation are strongly dependent on the hosen synhronization. Hene, although

the measurement of the beat frequeny variation is more preise than the measurement of the shift

in the number of fringes, it atually does not improve the testing of SR. Thus, ontrary to the

generally aepted opinion, the experiments [38℄ and [39℄ do not on(cid:28)rm the validity of the usual

(cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17)

Regarding the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) the modern laser versions [38℄ and [39℄ of the Mihelson-Morley

experiment are inomplete experiments (only the beat frequeny variation is measured) and annot

be ompared with the theory; in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the same 4D quantity has to be onsidered in

relatively moving IFRs and the frequeny, taken alone, is not a 4D quantity.

6 THE KENNEDY-THORNDIKE TYPE EXPERIMENTS

In the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment [40℄ a Mihelson interferometer with unequal armlengths

was employed and they looked for possible diurnal and annual variations in the di(cid:27)erene of the

optial paths due to the motion of the interferometer with respet to the preferred frame. The

measured quantity was, as in the Mihelson-Morley experiment, the shift in the number of fringes,

and in [40℄ the authors also found that was no observable fringe shift. We shall not disuss this

experiment sine the whole onsideration is ompletely the same as in the ase of the Mihelson-

Morley experiment, and, onsequently, the same onlusion holds also here, i.e., the experiment [40℄

does not agree with the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) but diretly proves the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) A modern version

of the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment was arried out in [41℄, and the authors stated: (cid:17)We have

performed the physially equivalent measurement (with the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment, my

remark) by searhing for a sidereal 24-h variation in the frequeny of a stabilized laser ompared

with the frequeny of a laser loked to a stable avity.(cid:17) The result was:

(cid:17)No variations were

found at the level of 2 × 10−13.” Also they delared:

(cid:17)This represents a 300-fold improvement

over the original Kennedy-Thorndike experiment and al lows the Lorentz transformations to be

dedued entirely from experiment at an auray level of 70 ppm.(cid:17) (my emphasis) The experiment

[41℄ is of the same type as the experiment [39℄, and neither the experiment [39℄ is physially

equivalent to the Mihelson-Morley experiment, as shown above, nor, ontrary to the opinion

of the authors of [41℄, the experiment [41℄ is physially equivalent to the Kennedy-Thorndike

experiment; the measurement of the beat frequeny variation is not equivalent to the measurement

of the hange in the phase di(cid:27)erene (in terms of the measurement of the shift in the number of

fringes). Namely suh equivalene an exist only in the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) treatment sine there

the phase di(cid:27)erene is determined only by the time di(cid:27)erene. And, additionally, the Mihelson-

Morley and the Kennedy-Thorndike experiments an be ompared both with the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)

and the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17), while the modern laser versions [39℄, [38℄ and [41℄ of these experiments are

inomplete experiments from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint and annot be ompared with the (cid:17)TT

relativity.(cid:17) Furthermore, the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) deals with the ovariant 4D Lorentz transformations

La

b (1), or with their representations Lµ

ν,e (2) in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and with Lµ

ν,r (7)

′

′

in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, and none of them an be dedued from the experiment [41℄. Thus

the treatment of the Mihelson-Morley experiment with true tensor quantities from [2℄ and Se.

5.1 here reveals that the relevant quantity for the measurements both in the Mihelson-Morley and

the Kennedy-Thorndike type experiments is the phase (34) and in the experiments it has to be

determined aording to the relation (36).

7 THE IVES-STILLWEL TYPE EXPERIMENTS

Ives and Stilwell [42℄ performed a preision Doppler e(cid:27)et experiment in whih they used a beam of

exited hydrogen moleules as a moving light soure. The frequenies of the light emitted parallel

and antiparallel to the beam diretion were measured by a spetograph (at rest in the laboratory).

22

The measured quantity in this experiment is

△ f /f0 = (△fb − △fr)/f0,

(51)

where f0 is the frequeny of the light emitted from resting atoms. △fb = |fb − f0| and △fr =
|fr − f0| , where fb is the blue-Doppler-shifted frequeny that is emitted in a diretion parallel to
v
is the veloity of the atoms relative to the laboratory), and fr is the red-Doppler-shifted
v. The quantity △f / f0 measures the extent

v

frequeny that is emitted in a diretion opposite to

(

to whih the frequeny of the light from resting atoms fails to lie halfway between the frequenies

fr and fb. In terms of wavelengths the relation (51) an be written as

△ λ/λ0 = (△λr − △λb)/λ0,

(52)

where △λr = |λr − λ0| and △λb = |λb − λ0| , and, as we said, λr and λb are the wavelengths shifted

due to the Doppler e(cid:27)et to the (cid:17)red(cid:17) and (cid:17)blue(cid:17) regions of the spetrum. In that way Ives and

Stilwell replaed the di(cid:30)ult problem of the preise determination of the wavelength with muh

simpler problem of the determination of the asymmetry of shifts of the (cid:17)red(cid:17) and (cid:17)blue(cid:17) shifted

lines with respet to the unshifted line. They [42℄ showed that the measured results agree with the

formula predited by the traditional formulation of SR, i.e., the usual (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) and not with

the lassial nonrelativisti expression for the Doppler e(cid:27)et. Let us explain it in more detail.

7.1 The (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation

(53)

(54)

In the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) one usually starts with the Lorentz transformation of the basis omponents

kµ(ω/c, k = nω/c) of the 4-vetor ka
(along the ommon x, x′−axes) IFR S′
traditional treatment. Then the Lorentz transformation in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization of kµ

of the light wave from an IFR S to the relatively moving

. Note that only the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization is used in suh

an be

written as

k0′

= ω

′

/c = γ(ω/c − βk1), k1′
n

= γ(k1 − βω/c), k2′

= k2, k3′

= k3,

or in terms of the unit wave vetor

(whih is in the diretion of propagation of the wave)

′

ω

= γω(1 − βn1), n1′

= N (n1 − β), n2′

= (N/γ)n2, n3′

= (N/γ)n3,

where N = (1 − βn1)−1. Now omes the main point in the derivation. Although the Lorentz trans-
from S to S′, Eqs.(53) and (54), transforms
formation of the basis omponents kµ
all four omponents of kµ
temporal part of kµ, i.e., the frequeny, as independent of the transformation of the spatial part
n. Thus the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) deals with two independent physial
of kµ, i.e., the unit wave vetor

of the 4-vetor ka

the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) treatment onsiders the transformation of the

phenomena - the Doppler e(cid:27)et and the aberration of light. (Reall that we have already met suh

omission of one part of the Lorentz transformation of a 4-vetor (written in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization)

in the derivation of the expressions for the Lorentz ontration (14) and the dilatation of time (17)

in Se. 2.2.) We note one again that suh distintion is possible only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization;

in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization the metri tensor gµν,r is not diagonal and onsequently the separation

of the temporal and spatial parts does not exist. Thus the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation is restrited

to the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. In agreement with suh theoretial treatment the existing experiments

(inluding the modern experiments based on ollinear laser spetrosopy; see, e.g., [43, 44, 45℄, or

the review [46℄) are designed in suh a way to measure either the Doppler e(cid:27)et or the aberra-

tion of light. Let us write the above transformation in the form from whih one an determine

the quantities in (52) and then ompare them with the experiments. The spetograph is at rest

in the laboratory (the S frame) and the light soure (at rest in the S′
v
relative to S. Then in the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) approah only the (cid:28)rst relation from (53), or (54),

frame) is moving with

is used, whih means that, in the same way as shown in previous ases, the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) deals

with two di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D spaetime, here ω and ω′
the temporal part of kµ, i.e., of ω, in terms of the wavelength λ we (cid:28)nd

. Then writting the transformation of

λ = γλ0(1 − β cos θ),

(55)

23

where λ is the wavelength reeived in the laboratory from the moving soure (the shifted line),
λ0 (= λ′

) is the natural wavelength (the unshifted line) and θ is the angle of

k

relative to the

v

diretion of

as measured in the laboratory. The nonrelativisti treatment of the Doppler e(cid:27)et

predits λ = λ0(1 − β cos θ), and in the lassial ase the Doppler shift does not exist for θ = π/2.
This transverse Doppler e(cid:27)et (θ = π/2, λ = γλ0, or ν = ν0/γ ) is always, in the traditional, (cid:17)AT

relativity,(cid:17) approah onsidered to be a diret onsequene of the time dilatation; it is asserted

(e.g.

[22℄) that the frequenies must be related as the inverse of the times in the usual relation

for the time dilatation △t = △t0γ . It is usually interpreted [46℄: (cid:17)The Doppler shift experiments

... ompare the rates of two (cid:17)loks(cid:17) that are in motion relative to eah other. They measure

time dilatation (my emphasis) and an test the validity of the speial relativity in this respet.(cid:17)

Similarly it is delared in [43℄: (cid:17)The experiment represents a more than tenfold improvement over

other Doppler shift measurements and veri(cid:28)es the time dilation e(cid:27)et (my emphasis) at an auray

level of 2.3 ppm.(cid:17) Obviously, as we said, the Doppler shift experiments are theoretially analysed

only by means of the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) whih treats the transformation of the temporal part of kµ
as independent of the transformation of the spatial part of kµ, and moreover ompletely neglets
the Lorentz transformation of the spatial part of kµ.

In the Ives and Stilwell type experiments the measurements are onduted at symmetri observa-

tion angles θ and θ+1800; partiularly in [42℄ θ is hosen to be ≃ 00
of motion is obtained from (55) as λb = γλ0(1 − β cos θ), while that one in the opposite diretion
(the angle θ + 1800
) is λr = γλ0(1 + β cos θ), and then △λb = |λb − λ0| = |λ0(1 − γ + βγ cos θ)| ,
△λr = |λr − λ0| = |λ0(γ − 1 + βγ cos θ)| , and the di(cid:27)erene in shifts is

. The wavelength in the diretion

△ λ = △λr − △λb = 2λ0(γ − 1) ≃ λ0β2,

(56)

where the last relation holds for β ≪ 1. Note that the redshift due to the transverse Doppler
e(cid:27)et (λ0β2
) is independent on the observation angle θ. In the nonrelativisti ase △λ = 0, the

transverse Doppler shift is zero. Ives and Stilwell found the agreement of the experimental results

with the relation (56) and not with the lassial result △λ = 0.

However, a more areful analysis shows that the agreement between the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) pre-

dition Eq.(56) and the experiments [42℄ is, ontrary to the general belief, only an (cid:17)apparent(cid:17)

agreement and not the (cid:17)true(cid:17) one. This agreement atually happens for the following reasons.

First, the theoretial result (56) is obtained in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization in whih one an speak

about the frequeny ω and the wave vetor
(5) whih transforms the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization to the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, kµ
omponents are onsidered), one (cid:28)nds k0
r = ki

e − k3

r = k0

e − k2

r = T µ
ν,rkν
e (only the
e, whene we onlude

k

as well-de(cid:28)ned quantities. Using the matrix T µ

ν,r

that in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization the theoretial preditions for the omponents of a 4-vetor, i.e.,

for λ, will be quite di(cid:27)erent but in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, i.e., but the result (56), and thus not
in the agreemement with the experiment [42℄. Further, the spei(cid:28) hoie of θ (θ ≃ 00) in the

experiments [42℄ is the next reason for the agreement with the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) result (56). Namely,

= n3′

too θ′ = 00, n1′

then n1 = 1, n2 = n3 = 0, and kµ
= 1 and n2′

if θ = 00
S′
and n1′
then θ′ = 1800
ion (its rest frame is S′
S frame). Sine in [42℄ the angle of the ray emitted by the ion at rest is hosen to be θ′ = 00
(1800
same θ = 00

is (ω/c, ω/c, 0, 0). From (53) or (54) one (cid:28)nds that in
= 0 (the same holds for θ = 1800, n1 = −1, n2 = n3 = 0,
= 0). In the experiments [42℄ the emitter is the moving

= −1, n2′

= n3′

(1800

), then the angle of this ray measured in the laboratory, where the ion is moving, will be the

). (Similarly happens in the modern versions [43, 45℄ of the Ives-Stilwell exper-

), while the observer is the spetrometer at rest in the laboratory (the

iment; the experiments [43, 45℄ make use of an atomi or ioni beam as a moving light analyzer

(the aelerated ion is the (cid:17)observer(cid:17)) and two ollinear laser beams (parallel and antiparallel to

the partile beam) as light soures (the emitter), whih are at rest in the laboratory.) From this

onsideration we onlude that in these experiments one an onsider only the Doppler e(cid:27)et, that

is, the transformation of ω (the temporal part of kµ; the omponent form of the true 4-vetor ka
k,

n, i.e.,

in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization), and not the aberration of light, i.e., the transformation of

(the spatial part of kµ

). Beause of that they found the agreement between the relation (55) (or

(56)) with the experiments. However, the relations (53) and (54) reveal that in the ase of an

arbitrary θ the transformation of the temporal part of kµ

annot be onsidered as independent of

the transformation of the spatial part. This means that in suh ase one annot expet that the

24

relation (56), taken alone, will be in agreement with the experiments performed at some arbitrary

θ. Suh experiments were, in fat, reently onduted and we disuss them here.

Pobedonostsev and ollaborators [47℄ performed the Ives-Stilwell type experiment but improved

the experimental setup and, what is partiularly important, the measurements were onduted at

symmetri observation angles 770
surement was done with a beam of H +

and 2570, whih are di(cid:27)erent from 00

(and 1800

). The mea-

2 ions at energies 175, 180, 210, 225, 260 and 275 keV. The

radiation from hydrogen atoms in exited state, whih are formed as a result of disintegration of

aelerated H +

2 , was observed. The radiation from the moving hydrogen atoms, giving the Doppler

shifted lines, was observed together with the radiation from the resting atoms existing in the same

working volume, and giving an unshifted line. The similar work was reported in [48℄ in whih a

beam of H +
observation angles 820
from all previous experiments that were performed at observation angles θ = 00

3 ions at energy 310 keV was used and the measurements were onduted at symmetri
and 2620. The results of the experiments [47℄ and [48℄ markedly di(cid:27)ered

(and 1800

). There-

fore in [48℄ Pobedonostsev delared: (cid:17)In omparing the wavelength of Doppler shifted line from a

moving emitter with the wavelength of an idential stati emitter, the experimental data orroborate

the lassial formula for the Doppler e(cid:27)et, not the relativisti one.(cid:17) Thus, instead of to (cid:28)nd the

(cid:17)relativisti(cid:17) result △λ ≃ λ0β2
result △λ ≃ 0, i.e., they found that the redshift due to the transverse Doppler e(cid:27)et (λ0β2
dependent on the observation angle θ. This experimental result strongly support our assertion

(56), (atually the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) result), they found the lassial

) is

that the agreement between the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and the Ives-Stilwell type experiments is only an

(cid:17)apparent(cid:17) agreement and not the (cid:17)true(cid:17) one.

7.2 The (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) approah

As already said in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) neither the Doppler e(cid:27)et nor the aberration of light exist

separately as well de(cid:28)ned physial phenomena. As shown in [1, 2℄ and Se. 2.2 here (see (17)

and the disussion there) in the 4D spaetime the temporal distanes (e.g., τE and τµ from Se.

4.2) refer to di(cid:27)erent quantities, whih are not onneted by the Lorentz transformation. The

same happens with ω and ω′

as the temporal parts of kµ, the omponent form of ka

in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

oordinatization . And, as Gamba [7℄ stated, the fat that the measurements of suh quantities

were made by two observers does not mean that relativity has something to do with the problem.

In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the entire 4D quantity, the true tensor or the CBGQ, has to be onsidered

both in the theory and in experiments. Therefore, in order to theoretially disuss the experiments

of the Ives-Stilwell type we hoose as the relevant quantity the wave vetor ka, the geometri

quantity, whih an be written in the oordinate-based geometri language as the relation (35),

ka = kµ

) in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization

frame of the spetrometer, i.e., in the laboratory frame.

In other permissible oordinatizations

and in other relatively moving IFRs these quantities will be exatly the same as in S′

and the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

oordinatization. That is a great pratial advantage of the true tensor formulation of SR; when

the whole (inluding the basis) 4D tensor quantity is onsidered then it is an invariant quantity.

Reently, Bekljamishev [49℄ ame to the same onlusions (but dealing only with the omponent

form in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) and explained the results of the experiments [47℄ and [48℄ taking

into aount the aberration of light together with the Doppler e(cid:27)et.

It is argued in [49℄ that

Eq.(55) for the Doppler e(cid:27)et an be realized only when the ondition for the aberration angle is

ful(cid:28)lled,

△ θ = β sin θ
where △θ = θ′ − θ, and β is taken to be β ≪ 1. The relation (59) diretly follows from the
expression for sin θ in (58) taking that β ≪ 1. The assymetri shift wil l be seen when the ol limator
assembly is tilted at a veloity dependent angle △θ. Instead of to work, as usual, with the arms
of the ollimator at (cid:28)xed angles θ and θ + 1800, Bekljamishev [49℄ proposed that the ollimator

assembly must be onstruted in suh a way that there is the possibility of the orretion of the

observation angles independently for both arms; for example, the arm at angle θ (θ + 1800
be tilted lokwise (ounter-lokwise) by the aberration angle △θ. Otherwise the assymetry in the

Doppler shifts will not be observed. Thus the experiments [47℄ and [48℄ would need to be repeated

taking into aount Bekljamishev's proposition. The positive result for the Doppler shift △λ (56),
when the ondition for the aberration angle △θ (59) is ful(cid:28)l led, wil l de(cid:28)nitely show that it is not

possible to treat the Doppler e(cid:27)et and the aberration of light as separate, wel l-de(cid:28)ned, e(cid:27)ets, i.e.,

that it is the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) and not the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) whih orretly explains the experiments

that test SR.

8 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In the (cid:28)rst part of this paper we have disussed and exposed the main di(cid:27)erenes between three

theoretial formulations of SR, the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) the ovariant approah to SR and the (cid:17)AT

relativity.(cid:17) In the seond part we have presented the omparison of these formulations with the

experiments. The analysis of the experiments whih test SR shows that they agree with the

preditions of the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and not, as usually supposed, with those of the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17)

In the (cid:17)muon(cid:17) experiment the (cid:29)uxes of muons on a mountain, Nm , and at sea level, Ns , are
measured. The (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) predits di(cid:27)erent values of the (cid:29)ux Ns (for the same measured
Nm ) in di(cid:27)erent synhronizations, but the measured Ns is of ourse independent of the hosen

oordinatization. Further, for some synhronizations these predited values of the (cid:29)ux at sea level

Ns are quite di(cid:27)erent than the measured ones. The reason for suh disagreement, as explained in

the theoretial part of this paper, Ses. 2, 2.1 and 2.2, is that in the usual, (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) analysis

of the (cid:17)muon(cid:17) experiment, for example, the lifetimes τE and τµ are onsidered to refer to the

same temporal distane (the same quantity) measured by the observers in two relatively moving

IFRs. But the transformation onneting τE and τµ (the dilatation of time (17)) is only a part of
the Lorentz transformation written in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, and, atually, τE and τµ refer to

di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D spaetime. Although their measurements were made by two observers,

the relativity has nothing to do with the problem, sine τE and τµ are di(cid:27)erent 4D quantities. The

(cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) in ontrast to the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) ompletely agrees with the (cid:17)muon(cid:17) experiments

in al l IFRs and al l permissible oordinatizations. In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the same 4D quantity (a

true tensor or a CBGQ) is onsidered in di(cid:27)erent IFRs and di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations; instead of

to work with τE and τµ the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) deals with the spaetime length l and the distane
4-vetor la

AB and formulate the radioative-deay law in terms of invariant quantities, i.e., the true

tensors or the CBGQs, Eqs. (30), (31) and (32).

In the Mihelson-Morley experiment the traditional, (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) derivation of the fring

shift △N deals only with the alulation, in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, of t1 and t2 (in S and S′
),
whih are the times required for the omplete trips OM1O and OM2O along the arms of the

Mihelson-Morley interferometer. The null fringe shift obtained with suh alulation is only in

an (cid:17)apparent,(cid:17) not (cid:17)true,(cid:17) agreement with the observed null fringe shift, sine this agreement was

obtained by an inorret proedure. Namely it is supposed in suh derivation that, e.g., t1 and t′
1
refer to the same quantity measured by the observers in relatively moving IFRs S and S′
onneted by the Lorentz transformation. However the relation t′
and 2.2, is not the Lorentz transformation of some 4D quantity, and t′
to the same 4D quantity onsidered in S′

1 = γt1, as shown in Ses. 2, 2.1
1 and t1 do not orrespond
and S respetively. Our (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) in ontrast to

that are

the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulations, deals always with the true tensor quantities or the CBGQs; in the

Mihelson-Morley experiment it is the phase (34) φ = kagablb

de(cid:28)ned as the true tensor quantity,

or equivalently the phase (36) de(cid:28)ned as the CBGQ. The (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) alulations yields the

observed nul l fringe shift (40) and that result holds for al l IFRs and al l oordinatizations.

In

addition we have shown that the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) atually deals only with the part k0l0 of
the whole phase φ, (34) or (36). This ontribution k0l0 is onsidered in the interferometer rest
frame S, while in the S′
takes into aount only the ontribution k0l0′

fator is taken to be the same in S and S′

; the k0

frame, in whih the interferometer is moving, the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)

frames (all is done only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)oordinatization). Thus in the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) two di(cid:27)erent

quantities k0
e l0e and k0
4D quantity for observers in S and S′

e l0′e (only the parts of the phase (34) or (36)) are onsidered to be the same

frames, and these quantities are onsidered to be onneted

by the Lorentz transformation. Suh an inorret proedure then aused an apparent (not true)

agreement of the traditional analysis with the results of the Mihelson-Morley experiment. Sine

only a part of the whole phase φ (34) or (36) is onsidered the traditional result is synhronization,

i.e., oordinatization, dependent results. The agreement between the traditional analysis and the

experiment exists only when Einstein's synhronization of distant loks is used and not for another

synhronization. This is also proved in Se. 4.1, where the non-null fringe shift (50) is found for the

(cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization. The improved (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation of the fringe shift from [36℄ (again

in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) takes into aount the hanges in frequenies due to the Doppler e(cid:27)et

and (cid:28)nds a (cid:17)surprising(cid:17) non-null fringe shift (41). We have shown in Se. 4.1 that the non-null

theoretial result for the fringe shift (41) from [36℄ is easily obtained from our (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

approah taking only the produt k0′

e l0′e in the alulation of the inrement of phase φ′

e in S′

in

whih the apparatus is moving. Thus again as in the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation two di(cid:27)erent

e l0e and k0′

quantities k0
same 4D quantity for observers in S and S′
onneted by the Lorentz transformation. Sine only a part k0′
e l0′e of the whole 4D tensor quantity
φ (34) or (36) is onsidered the non-null fringe shift (41) an be shown to be quite di(cid:27)erent in

e l0′e (only the parts of the phase (34) or (36)) are onsidered to be the

frames, and onsequently that these two quantities are

another oordinatization, e.g., in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization (see [2℄).

The same onlusions an be drawn for the Kennedy-Thorndike type experiments.

In the Ives-Stilwell type experiments the agreement between the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation for

the Doppler e(cid:27)et and the experiments is again only an (cid:17)apparent(cid:17) agreement and not the (cid:17)true(cid:17)

one. Namely the transverse Doppler shift (λ0β2

Further in the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) approah only the transformation of ω (the temporal part of

(35).) Thus in this ase too the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) deals with two di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D spaetime,

versions [43, 45℄, just suh angles were hosen, it was possible to onsider only the transformation

of ω , i.e., only the Doppler e(cid:27)et, and not the onomitant aberration of light. Beause of that

they found the agreement between the relation (55) (or (56)) and the experiments. When the

experiments were performed at observation angles θ 6= 00

(and 1800

), as in [47℄ and [48℄, the results

disagreed with the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation whih takes into aount only the transformation of

ω , i.e., only the Doppler e(cid:27)et. Furthermore, sine the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) alulation deals only with
a part of the whole 4D quantity ka

(35), the agreement with the experiments will not exist in,

e.g., the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization. The (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) alulation onsiders the whole 4D quantity, the

wave vetor ka
oordinatization and in S′, the rest frame of the emitter. All results are frame and oordinatization

(35) (or its square (57)). Therefore one an make the whole alulation in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

independent. Now the Doppler e(cid:27)et and the aberration of light are unseparated phenomena. The

results of suh alulation agrees with the experiments [42℄ and [43, 45℄ (made at θ = 00
Also the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) alulation predits the positive result for the Doppler shift △λ (56) in the
experiments of the type [47℄ and [48℄, if the ondition for the aberration angle △θ (59) is ful(cid:28)l led.

)).

This agrees with Bekljamishev's explanation [49℄ (that is valid only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) of

the experiments [47℄ and [48℄. The advantage of the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) alulation is that it is valid

in all permissible oordinatizations.

The disussion in this paper learly shows that our invariant formulation of SR, i.e., the

(cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) ompletely agrees with al l onsidered experiments in al l IFRs and al l permissible

oordinatizations. This is not the ase with none of the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) formulations of SR. These

results are diretly ontrary to the generally aepted opinion about the validity of the usual (cid:17)AT

relativity,(cid:17) i.e., of the Einstein formulation of SR.

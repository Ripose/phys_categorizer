Abstract

We propose a fundamental relation for a classical ideal gas that is valid at all temper-
atures with remarkable accuracy. All thermodynamical properties of classical ideal
gases can be deduced from this relation at arbitrary temperature.

The famous equation of state for an ideal classical gas is

P V = NkBT .

(1)

Interestingly, a classical gas obeys this relation at all temperatures as long as it is ideal,
i.e., the Hamiltonian of the system does not depend on the co-ordinates of the particles at
all. The proof is simple, and appears in most textbooks [1]. We will also provide the proof
later.

An equation of state, however, does not specify a system completely [2]. For example,
from the equation of state in Eq. (1), we cannot ﬁnd the entropy of the system, and
many other properties for that matter. Of course if we have a fundamental relation for the
system, it contains all thermodynamic information about the system including the equations
of state themselves [2]. These are, for example, relations of the type S = S(U, V, N) or
U = U(S, V, N), which express the entropy or the internal energy as a function of other
extensive parameters of the system. Legendre transforms of these equations work just
as well, like the Helmholtz free energy A as a function of T , V and N. However,
it
is often diﬃcult to obtain such relations in closed forms which would be valid for any
temperature. The Sackur-Tetrode relation, for example, is a fundamental relation of the
form S = S(U, V, N), but unlike the relation in Eq. (1), it is valid only if the gas is non-
relativistic, i.e., if the temperature is small in the sense that βmc2
1, where m is the
mass of the gas particles. Our aim in this article is to suggest a fundamental relation for
the classical ideal gas that can be used at any temperature.

Since the gas is assumed to be ideal, the energy of any particle in the gas depends only
on its momentum. At a momentum p, let us denote the energy of a particle by ε(p). The

where we have used Stirling’s formula for ln N!. It is to be noted that f (β) is the only
component which is not exactly known at this point. Our aim would be to determine it.

For this, we start by evaluating some thermodynamic quantities. The pressure of the

gas is given by

irrespective of the functional form of f (β). This is Eq. (1), and this is why it is valid for
any temperature.

Next we look at the energy density. This is given by

For arbitrary temperatures, we should use the relativistically correct formula for ε(p).
For an ideal gas, there is no potential energy. The kinetic energy of a particle with momen-
tum p is given by

The choice for the parameter b will be made later, in Eq. (29). However, in order to give
a preview of the goodness of this ﬁt, we anticipate the value and show the resulting ﬁt as
points in Fig. 1. As the ﬁgure suggests, the ﬁt is very good for all temperatures. In fact,
the agreement between the ﬁt and direct numerical calculation is considerably better than
1% everywhere.

It has to be remarked that ε(p), and consequently ̺, do not include the contribution
from the rest mass energy of the particles. However, it is trivial to obtain a relation between
P and the energy density ρ which includes the mass energy as well. Obviously,

where n = N/V is the number density of particles. Using Eq. (1), we can write it as

for a classical ideal gas. If we then deﬁne an equation of state in the form

the constant ω will have a very simple relation with w which can be obtained by dividing
both sides of Eq. (18) by P :

We now go back to the ﬁt of Eq. (16), and notice that from Eq. (10), we can now

determine ln f . In fact, using the ﬁt, we can write

noting that d ln β = d ln ξ, since mc2 is constant. Thus,

= K

3 ln ξ +

ln(2ξ + b) ,

(22)

where K is an integration constant.

To determine this constant, we may use of the form for ln f for large ξ. In this case,
small momentum values dominate the integrand, so that we can approximate ε(p) by p2/2m.
Once this is done, the integration in Eq. (4) can be exactly performed and one obtains

ρ = ̺ + mc2n ,

Notice that this has the correct ξ-dependece as the non-relativistic formula of Eq. (23).
This is the reason why we had to take α = 1
2 in Eq. (15). Moreover, this also allows us to
determine K, viz.,

Putting this value of K into Eq. (22), we obtain

The remaining constant b can be determined by using the asymptotic value of f for
small ξ. In this case, large momentum values dominate the integrand so that we can put
ε(p) = cp. Once this approximation is made, the integration in Eq. (4) can be performed
analytically and we obtain

This ﬁnally completes the ﬁt that we sought for. The ﬁt is shown in Fig. 2, along with the
values obtained by direct numerical integration.

It may be useful to make a comment about our choice of the parameter b. We have
chosen it so as to ﬁt the low-ξ end perfectly. However, the resulting ﬁt is worst (though
still better than 1%) for intermediate values of ξ, which shows clearly in Fig. 1. If we take
a slightly smaller value of ξ, the middle part ﬁts much better. Of course it also means that
the agreement for small ξ gets a bit worse. To be precise, if instead of the value b given in
Eq. (29) we choose some other value b′ for the parameter under consideration, the values
of ln f mismatches by an amount 3
1. But since the value of f (β) itself
is very large for small values of ξ, the fractional error is very small. A choice like b = e,
the base of natural logarithms, makes the overall ﬁt much better, to better than 0.5%, for
the entire range of temperatures. If we go further down, say b = 8/3, the ﬁt becomes very
good in the middle but considerably worse at the ends.
We can put our ﬁt for f (ξ) into Eq. (6). This gives

2 ln(b/b′) for ξ

If we recall the deﬁnition of ξ from Eq. (14), we realize that this is an expression for the
free energy as a function of the volume, temperature and total number of particles. This
is thus a fundamental relation which can be used at any temperature. All thermodynamic
properties of an ideal gas can then be deduced from this relation at arbitrary temperature.
This is the result. Of course it is not exact; it is a ﬁt to the numerical results. But it
is a very good ﬁt, and the usefulness of such an expression cannot be overemphasized. In
most practical situations, a closed analytic expression is much easier to use than numer-
ical integrations. Our expression for the Helmholtz free energy in Eq. (31) provides such
an analytic expression which can be used at any temperature to obtain thermodynamic
properties of a classical ideal gas.

Abstract

The necessity of an introduction of discrete physical objects in physics con-
ception is analysed taking into consideration an optimum stage for postulating
of some like objects in microworld as well as in macroworld including the new
“physical graph” as a discrete microobject and carrying out its analogy with
“Kirchhoﬀ’s laws graph” for an electric network as a prototype of discrete
macroobject which correspond both to discrete sets of trees — root trees
(for microobjects) or skeleton trees (for macro networks). The transitions are
found connecting the usual S-matrix theory with Feynman integrals and Feyn-
man diagrams and the new physical graph kinematics formalism which uses
the natural root trees basis for the treatment of the structure of an arbitrary
complicated physical microobject with a speciﬁc “graph microgeometry” —
beyond space-time consideration. Accordingly to the QCD results the proton
(nucleon) mass is determined in terms of the root trees number Tv=11=1842
which corresponds to v=11 physical graph vertices. It is supposed that by
means of a double- and a triple-splitting of the root trees numbers could be
estimated the masses of the various series of another microobjects.

point of view to gain a hearing.

Of course, it is naturally that in case of the macroobjects it is not necessary obviously
to introduce some alternatives for this standard approach within a customary “external”
geometry. Nevertheless, beginning from the most elementary viewpoint for describing atomic
events we could not picture how the jump from one electronic orbit to another took place
and we just had to accept it as a kind of discontinuity.

The following evolution of a picture of the nature towards the nuclear and subnuclear
microobjects picture leads us to more open discontinuities and at last to the evident discrete
physical objects perhaps with the proper “internal” geometry corresponding to their inner
probably discrete structure.
It it notable that a well-known ﬁeld-theoretical problem of
the divergence diﬃculties at the small distances for now structural physical microobjects

eliminates automatically what could be considered as an essential result in the area of
discrete objects physics.

In parts I–III of paper we describe a possible transition to the some representation of

discrete physical objects using the graph theory formalism.

It is important to have in view that in general a discrete mathematics as well as the
physical theories and models with any discrete structural objects are not derived from or
reduced to the continuous mathematics and the physical theories and models with corre-
sponding continuous objects. Therefore the real appearance in physics of various discrete
physical objects can be made solely by the introduction of an adequate mathematical postu-
late without some additional justiﬁcations but using any typical “discrete-like” results from
an initial quasi-continuous physical theory; nevertheless the continuous theories altogether
are not excluded from a following consideration. For this purpose however it is necessarily
to ﬁnd a deﬁnite stage in continuous physics development setting up the insuﬃciency of its
continuous theory. Inasmuch as the above-mentioned diﬃculties arise in phenomena involv-
ing very small distances (or very high energies) we may choose as a such stage the transition

matrix theory for microobjects. Taking into account a non-equivalence of some following
singularities–analysed diagram technique (post–Feynman), based on the stable microobjects
only, to a perturbation theory we postulate a new derivative physical graph formalism as a
ﬁrst step to discrete microobject. Owing to an analogy of such physical graph with Kirch-
hoﬀ’s laws graph for an electric network there exist various discrete physical objects which
may be presented through the discrete sets of graphs—skeleton or root trees, beyond usual
space-time.
In part II a proposed graph formalism is applied to the calculation of some
qualitative and numerical characteristics for diﬀerent microobjects without using of the con-
tinuous theories formalism (QED, QCD, etc.) itself but only its results. And part III is
devoted to a possible realization of the Heisenberg—Dyson’s two-layer physics.

1.1 Heisenberg’s S-matrix
of 1943 and its state vectors basis
in the Hilbert space

It is known that proposed by Heisenberg in 1943 the S-matrix contains the only physically
measurable quantities and supposes the existence of a corresponding Hilbert space with the
positive metric and the possibility to construct the complete Hilbert space basis. The S-
matrix must be unitary and have so much analyticity that it represents what observed as
causality; it also must have an invariance for the Lorentz group and for TCP, an approximate
invariance for the isospin group, and so on.

Since 1948–49 the Feynman version of QED became the prototype of what is now called
S-matrix theory which gave directly the rules for calculating S-matrix elements by means
of Feynman integrals and corresponding Feynman diagrams. It is important the Feynman
theory is a pure physical object theory, and the Feynman diagram describes any elementary
process naively as a propagation of physical object from one vertex to another along a
connected line.

may serve as a starting point for the following consistent consideration of the networks of
these physical graphs in momentum space. Although it is necessarily to note that the direct
solution of the full set of algebraic equations (3)–(6), (8), (9) — for a separated as well as
for a complicated network of such physical graphs — is enough complex and labor-intensive

but quite feasible. The fact is that the results may be classiﬁed on the base of the forms of
construction of the special l, v — sequences of physical graphs, namely the ladder and the
parquet l, v — sequences.

2 KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS MATRIX FOR

AN ELECTRIC NETWORK ANALOGY OF 1847

In agreement with the classical Kirchhoﬀ’s work of 1847 (see Ref.

[4]) initiated a de-
velopment of the graph theory (especially in part of the particular graphs — the trees) the
investigation of an arbitrary electric network with n wires is carried out by means of two
laws:

ǫJ = J ∗
j ;

j = 1, 2, . . . , N,

ǫJ = 0;

i = 1, 2, . . . , v − N,

X[j]

X(i)

Jω =

E; r = 1, 2, . . . , l.

X<r>

X<r>

The ﬁrst, current law for N external (algebraic sum over [j] in (12a)) and for v − N
internal (algebraic sum over (i) in (12b)) vertices of the electric network states that the
algebraic sum of the currents J ﬂowing through all the network wires that meet at a vertex
is the external current J ∗ or zero. The second, voltage law for l circuits (loops) states that
the algebraic sum of the electromotive forces E within any closed circuit is equal to the
algebraic sum of the products of the currents J and the resistances ω in the various portions
of the circuit.

The Kirchhoﬀ’s laws (12a), (12b), (13) for an electric network including only the real
measurable quantities J, E (and also ω) are formally the same as the linear equations (3)–
(5) for an identical topologically physical graph with real objects quantities q, p. The
electric circuit analogy still with the suitable Feynman diagram has been carried by Bjorken,
T. T. Wu and Boiling earlier in 1959–64 (see Ref. [1]). It is easy to show (see for example,
Ref.
[5]) however that the number of independent equations among (12a)–(12b) as in the
case of set (3) and (4) is equal to v − 1 and therefore the rank of the resulting square matrix
of coeﬃcients

is exactly corresponded to the number of unknown components of the column vector (Jn)

In this way the soluble matrix equation for a typical Kirchhoﬀ’s matrix (14) may be

2.1 Skeleton trees basis
for electric network

(15)

(16)

In accordance to Kirchhoﬀ’s theorem (see Refs.

[2], [5]) every electric network can be
substituted by a corresponding graph with the same number of vertices v. The solution of
the equations (12) and (13) for this adequate graph may be presented through the set of
skeleton v-trees. The maximum set of independent skeleton v-trees for the corresponding
full Kv-graph, with
lines, forms the skeleton trees basis for electric network. By using
of this basis can be constructed the all possible solutions for various concrete networks (lots
of such electric network examples described in Ref. [5]).

2.2 Kirchhoﬀ–Maxwell topological analysis
of electric networks

Two-layer structure of the typical Kirchhoﬀ’s matrix (14) (or analogous matrix (7)) in a
general matrix equation (15) (or in corresponding matrix equation (10)) shows a separation
of the functions of the matrix operator (14) (or (7)) acting, ﬁrstly, upon the “internal
(“upper layer”)
geometry” of electric network by means of the incidence matrix

I(ǫ)
(v−1×n)

and, secondly, upon the topologically other equilibrium conditions along the circuits (loops)
of electric network by means of the loop matrix C(ǫ)
(“under layer”) within the
(l×n)

Dn(ω)
(n×n)

framework of the same skeleton trees basis. In this connection it is important to note that

6

into the structure of the incidence matrix I(ǫ)

is embedded the “internal geometry” of

(v−1×n)
real electric network including the natural skeleton trees basis factually as a creation of the
speciﬁc “graph geometry” beyond the space-time consideration.

By introducing of “circuit currents” of Helmholtz–Maxwell instead of “branch (wire)
currents” of Kirchhoﬀ can be performed formally the analogous concrete calculations on the
base of corresponding topologically equivalent Maxwell rules (see Ref. [5]) within the same
“graph geometry”.

Obviously, the last formalism of the Helmholtz–Maxwell “circuit currents” is like to the
formalism of “(p, k)-diagrams” (see Ref. [6]) which may be used as an adequate tool for the
analysis of the physical graphs from section 1. 2. However this problem is beyond the task
of a given paper.

3 “MICROGEOMETRY” INSIDE
OF THE PHYSICAL OBJECTS
CONSIDERING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK
OF THE INPUT–OUTPUT SCHEME

Heisenberg’s theory of the S-matrix connects the input and output of a scattering ex-
periment without seeking to give a localized description of the intervening events including
the inner structure of a propagated physical object.

Introducing a full set of the external 4-momenta pj (j=1, 2, . . . , N) simultaneously for
N1 ingoing as well as for N2 outgoing physical objects (N1 + N2 = N) we can obtain the
solution of the equations (3)–(6), together with the mass shell conditions (8)–(9), in the
i , sik = (pi + pk)2, sikl = (pi + pk + pl)2,
terms of independent kinematic invariants si = p2
siklm = (pi + pk + pl + pm)2, etc. connecting with each other by kinematic and geometrical
conditions in the 4-dimensional momentum space (see Refs.
[7–10]). Thus we should be
presented the whole physical picture for the real scattering process where an inner structure
of the participating physical objects is factually omitted and the latter should be introduced
only by insertion of the separate full graph with v vertices Kv as a some complicated vertex-
fragment for concrete physical object.

3.1 Root trees basis for
physical graph of microobject

Within the framework of the input–output scheme for the full physical graph with in-
serted complicated Kv-vertex , as a physical microobject vertex-fragment in the general
scheme , it is to be determined the special separate vertex — the root of tree which coin-
cides with input vertex, and the other part of physical graph is to be arranged in hierarchical
order, creating a path to output vertex (vertices).

Thus the solution of the corresponding linear equations (3)–(5) for this new hierarchical
physical graph may be presented already through the set of root v-trees as against of skeleton
v-trees for electric network in section 2.1.

If we consider the full physical graph as an unique Kv-vertex in the input–output scheme
then may be formulated the problem of the discrete physical object structure. The maximum

7

v
2 (cid:17)

set of independent root v-trees for corresponding full Kv-graph, with the separate root-vertex
lines, forms the natural root trees basis for the hierarchical physical graph, i. e.
and
a set of paths between the root-vertex, as an initial point of input, and the ﬁnal points of
output.

3.2 On the proton mass

The fact is that the above-described initial S-matrix theory overgrew practically in the
speciﬁc physical graph kinematics formalism allowing to realize the discrete physical mi-
croobject calculations without use of the traditional space-time treatment.

We start with the consideration of the proton mass problem within the framework of the
results of QCD-theory [11]. It is shown earlier (in 3. 1) that “internal microgeometry” of the
discrete physical microobjects reﬂects their inner structure and therefore is to correspond
to the vertex many-point Green function (without free tails). These points are responsible
for determination of the number of vertices of the root trees ﬁlling in graph microgeometry
of the discrete physical microobjects (in a Riemann [15] sense).

If, as usually supposed, the full proton mass is concentrated into an internal gluon ﬁeld
(Refs. [12–13]) — a case of the pure gluodynamics — then from the Gell-Mann–Low function
(Ref. [14])

β(g2) = −b

g4
16π2 + O
where g — coupling constant, we have a dimensionless constant b=11 characterized the
number of vertices of the corresponding root trees. For setting up the graph equivalent
to the electron mass me we choice the corresponding simplest case of the root tree graph
with v=2 vertices inasmuch as the number of a such root tree Tv=2 = 1 (the case v=1 is
the trivial graph — an isolate vertex). Therefore the number of the root trees with v=11
vertices Tv=11 = 1842 (see Ref. [2]) determines for the proton mass

g2
4π (cid:19)

(cid:18)

In the standard QCD-model with the number of quark ﬂavours nf we have a dimension-
less constant b = 11 − 2/3 nf what is responsible for the pion mass at nf =3: Tv=9=286 (see
Ref. [2]) or

Mp = 1842me.

mπ = 286 me.

3.3 On the “double - and triple - splitting”
mechanism in the physics and the biology hierarchy

The investigation of the inner structure of the discrete physical microobjects by using
of the analysis of a speciﬁc “graph microgeometry” may be continued on the base of the
all kinds of root v-trees from v-sequences (see Table 1) what could permit to classify the
various discrete

relation is into the interval

and therefore we could produce the double- and triple-splitting operation on the “mass-
values” of the various Tv before the experimental ﬁtting. In Table 1 we may have conven-
tionally three zones:

inequality 16 Tv 6115 for the stable atomic and nuclear discrete objects quantities,
inequality 286 6 Tv 61842 for the pion-nucleon discrete objects quantities,
inequality 4766 6 Tv for the heavy physical and the complicated biological hierarchical

objects quantities.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion it is important to note that the development of the graph kinematics
formalism for the discrete physical objects (in a Riemann [15] sense) which has two-layer
matrix description (incidence+loop matrices) with natural “graph microgeometry” beyond
the traditional space-time consideration leads obviously to the more general results in the
area of the creation of the Heisenberg–Dyson’s two-layer physics (see for example, [16]) with
the proper “internal geometry”. In the upper layer of this scheme we have the formalism
for real physical objects, their momenta, energy, forces, etc. Whereas in the under layer we
have the symbolical ﬁelds quantities, such as ﬁeld strength, induction, intensity, etc. which
may be discovered only through their energy and forces in the upper layer.

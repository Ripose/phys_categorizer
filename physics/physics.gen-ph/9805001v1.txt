ABSTRACT

A time-decaying Dirac equation is suggested. For a free particle with rest mass

about 0.5GeV, the live-time is about 10−25 second in the rest frame.

In two recent articles [1], the author has discussed some properties concerning a

free Dirac electron. Based on Dirac equation, a possibility of a complex 4-dimensional

spac-time manifold was suggested, which leads to a function for describing a free par-

ticle should be a free wave. Furthermore since there are couplings between the spatial

variables and the internal variables (αipi) [2] in the Hamiltonian, the generalized co-

ordinates become mixtures of spatial coordinates and the internal coordinates.

In

fact, Dirac [2] calculated that x1 = a1 + c2p1H −1t +

c¯h(α1 − cp1H −1)H −1. As a

consequence the velocities of the genrealized coordinates ˙x′

is are cαi. However, the
velocities of the spatial coordinates vi = piH −1(i = 1, 2, 3) which commute with H

and can be simultaneously measured with H. That is, there two kinds of velocities

for a free Dirac particle. In this note, it is suggested that a short-lived free Dirac

particle may exist which may be described by a time decaying Dirac equation.

Given a Hamiltonian

H = c(p2

x + p2

y + p2

z + m2c2)1/2.

Let us deﬁne a Dirac process as the following: Introduce the α′

is and β together with

their relations as deﬁned in ref.[2]. Then take the square root of the right-hand-side

of equation (1), we obtain the Dirac Hamiltonian

(1)

(2)

In this way, the internal variables are introduced. Meanwhile, interactions between

the spectial variables and the internal variables are also introduced. The generalized

coordinales are created and become mixtures of the spatial varibles and the internal

variables. Also, two kinds of velocities are produced.

In classical machanics, a Hamiltonian H(p, q) is deﬁned for a free particle as

H(p, q) = X pi ˙qi − L(qi, ˙qi),

where the q′

is, ˙q′

is and the p′

is are the generalized coordinates, generalized velocities

and genrealized momenta. The ˙q′

is are supposed to be eliminated by some available

relations. For a relativistic free particle, L is given as [3]

L = −mc2(1 − 1

c2 X ˙q2

i )1/2.

If we substitude equation (4) into equation (3) and elimmate the ˙qis by ˙qi = piH −1, we

will have equation (1). Then we can perform a Dirac process to obtain Dirac equation.

However, if we perform the Dirac process one step before we get to equation (1). That

is, we perform the Dirac process for the function L of equation (4) and substitute

into equation (3), then we have

H(p, q) = X pi ˙qi + mc2(β ± i
c

X αi ˙qi),

where the ± sign is determined by the condition for a ﬁnite solution with respect to the

forward or backword propergating wave. Now we have a Dirac type of Hamiltonian

where the ˙q′

is are to be eliminated by suitable relations. If we tak ˙qi = piH −1, it is

straightforward to show that equation (5) reduces to equation (2) by noticing that,

H 2 − c2p2 = (mc2)2, and (−iβα′

is, β) is equivalent to (α′

is, β). We are aware that the

Hamiltonian (5) is supposed to describe a free Dirac particle, if this is correct, then a

Dirac free particle has two kinds of velocities, velocities of the generalized coordinates

3

and those of the spatial coordinates. Therefore we can also take ˙qi = cαi in equation

(5). Thus we obtain

H = X cαipi + mc2β ± 3imc2.

(6)

This Hamiltonian will result with a solution having a couplex energy that represents

a particle with a life-time about ¯h/(3mc2). For a particle with rest mass about 0.5

GeV, the life-time is about 10−25 second in the rest frame. In the lab-frame, its life-

time can be determined by relativity.

We conclude that a Lagrange-Hamilton formalism may lead to two kinds of Dirac

particles, one kind of them are stable particles, the other unstable. Finally, one may

wish to ask whether one of those un-discovered particles, such as a quark, may belong

to the second kind of particles. If an unstable particle of this kind would be created

from a source, it can only live for such a short time, then decay immediately. If there

is no available exit channel, it must go back to the source again.

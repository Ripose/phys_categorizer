Abstract

It is shown in this paper that recent results that below the Fermi
temperature, Fermions obey anomalous semionic statistics, could ex-
plain such apprently diverse phenomena as the magnetism of Pulsars
and White Dwarfs on the one hand and earth like planets, on the
other.

1 Introduction

It is known that Neutron stars or Pulsars have strong magnetic ﬁelds of
∼ 108 Tesla in their vicinity, while certain White Dwarfs have magnetic
ﬁelds ∼ 102 Tesla. If we were to use conventional arguments that when a sun
type star with a magnetic ﬁeld ∼ 10−4 Tesla contracts, there is conservation
of magnetic ﬂux, then we are lead to magnetic ﬁelds for Pulsars and White
Dwarfs which are a few orders of magnitude less than the required values[1].
We will now argue, that in the light of recent results that below the Fermi
temperature, the degenerate electron gas obeys a semionic statistics, that
is a statistics in between the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein, it is possible
to deduce the correct magnetic ﬁelds for Neutron stars and White Dwarfs.
Moreover this will also enable us to deduce the correct magnetic ﬁeld of a
planet like the earth.

2 Anomalous Behaviour Below the Fermi Tem-

perature

In recent years, it has been realized that under speciﬁc conditions, for ex-
ample low dimensionality or sub Fermi temperatures, Fermions exhibit an
anomalous character - they obey statistics inbetween the Fermi-Dirac and
Bose-Einstein statistics[2, 3].
Let us speciﬁcally consider the case of sub Fermi temperatures (cf.ref.[3]).
To notice the anomalous behaviour in a simple way we observe that in this
case as is known[4] the assembly ﬁlls up each and every single particle energy
level below the Fermi energy, with the Fermionic occupation number 1. The
density of states in momentum space is given by d3p, exactly as in the case
of Bosons. Whence we obtain the well known result

ǫF =

where ǫF is the Fermi energy. The result for Phonons which obey Bose-
Einstein statistics is identical to equation (1) (cf.ref.[3]).
The anomalous behaviour can also be seen as follows: We have for the energy
density e, in this case

where pF is the Fermi momentum and TF is the Fermi temperature. On the
other hand, it is known that [5, 6] in n dimensions we have,

(For the case n = 3, (3) is identical to the Stefan-Boltzmann law). Com-
parison of (3) and (2) shows that the assembly behaves with the fractal
dimensionality 1.5.
Let us now consider an assembly of N electrons. As is known, if N+ is the
average number of particles with spin up, the magnetisation per unit volume
is given by

where µ is the electron magnetic moment. At low temperatures, in the usual
theory, N+ ≈ N

the above semionic statistics we have,

If N is very large, this makes an enormous diﬀerence in (4). Let us use (4)
and (5) for the case of Neutron stars.

3 Magnetism of Neutron Stars and White Dwarfs

In this case, as is well known, we have an assembly of degenerate electrons at
temperatures ∼ 107K, (cf.for example [4]). So the considerations of Section

of the degenerate electrons, n ∼ 1031 per c.c.[7, 8]. So using (4) and (5)
and remembering that µ ≈ 10−20G, the magnetic ﬁeld near the Pulsar is
∼ 1011G ≤ 108 Tesla, as required.
As mentioned earlier some White Dwarfs also have magnetic ﬁelds. If the
White Dwarf has an interior of the dimensions of a Neutron star, with a
similar magnetic ﬁeld, then remembering that the radius of a White Dwarf
is about 103 times that of a Neutron star, its magnetic ﬁeld would be 10−6
times that of the neutron star, which is known to be the case.

4 Discussion

It is quite remarkable that the above mechanism can also explain the mag-
netism of the earth. As is known the earth has a solid core of radius of about
1200 kilometers and temperature about 6000 K[9]. This core is made up al-
most entirely of Iron (90%) and Nickel (10%). It can easily be calculated that
the number of particles N ∼ 1048, and that the Fermi temperature ∼ 105. In
this case we can easily verify using (4) and (5) that the magnetic ﬁeld near
the earth’s surface ∼ 1G, which is indeed the case.
It may be mentioned that the anomalous Bosonic behaviour given in (5)
would imply a sensitivity to external magnetic inﬂuences which could lead
to eﬀects like magnetic ﬂips or reversals.

and the introduction of the ﬁeld B, does not lead to a signiﬁcant magnetic
ﬁeld in (4). But, if as in Section 2, β 6= 1
2, then in view of
the fact that N is very large, the contribution from (4) could be signiﬁcant.
Indeed in the case of the earth magnetic reversals do take place from time
to time and are as yet not satisfactorily explained[10].

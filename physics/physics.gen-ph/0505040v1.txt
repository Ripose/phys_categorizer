This article presents an informational approach to particle physics based on an elementary bit
structure. It is shown how quantum mechanics develops from the necessity of collecting information
relative to experimental setups. Basic symmetry properties of bit structures then lead to a fun-
damental SO(3,2) symmetry of the Hilbert space. For large bit sets SO(3,2) can be approximated
by the Poincar´e group. Thereby a relativistic space-time continuum is obtained. In the Poincar´e
approximation certain bit structures exhibit properties of particles corresponding to the three lepton
families. Masses of heavy leptons are derived in good agreement with experimental values. These
results reﬂect natural properties of bit structures. They are obtained without making use of “ﬁrst
principles”.

I. INTRODUCTION

This article is based on Bohr’s dictum [2]:

“Physical phenomena are observed relative to diﬀerent experimental setups.”

Bohr meant by this that the experimental setup determines which of the complementary properties
of a quantum mechanical system is measured. I will use Bohr’s dictum in the general sense that
“particle physics is a discipline that describes microscopic phenomena relative to macroscopic setups”.

There is another famous dictum of Bohr’s [3]:

“Physics is not about reality, but about what we can say about reality.”

Bohr hereby meant that physics deals with information about reality. If this statement is correct
then concepts of information theory must have a legitimate place in physical theories.

In the past there were several attempts to base physical theories on elementary informational

concepts.

In the 1971 R. Penrose [4] made an attempt to describe the geometry of space-time in a purely
combinatorial way. Penrose studied networks of two-component spinors which represent the simplest
quantum mechanical objects. He was able to show that large systems of such spinors, generate
properties of angular direction in three-dimensional space. Despite this success, the concept of
SU(2) based spin networks was not considered rich enough to also describe distance [5]. Penrose’s
interest, therefore, turned to more complex twistor objects. Nowadays spin networks are discussed
as models of space-time at Planck scales [6].

Another attempt to derive space-time from “binary alternatives” was undertaken by C. F. von
Weizs¨acker [7,8] and co-workers. In this concept a physical particle is considered as an aggregate
of 1040 binary alternatives, representing the knowledge about the particle. Although indications for
a Poincar´e symmetric space-time structure were obtained, the work remained at an experimental
stage without having established a deﬁnite link to empirical particle physics. Today von Weizs¨acker’s
binary alternatives are used in theoretical concepts of quantum computing under the name of Q-bits.

This article describes a new approach to base particle physics on an informational concept.
If physics is a matter of obtaining and processing information, then particle physics deals with the
“smallest” building blocks of our information about reality and their combinations to other “small”
pieces of information. In this context “smallest”, obviously, means such informational structures
that cannot be divided into smaller pieces.

The smallest pieces of information are well-known: These are the bits (binary digits) of information
theory. But what role do bits play in particle physics? Can we observe bits in an experiment? What
is the relationship between bits and those terms that are used in particle physics like space-time,
symmetries, particles and interaction?

This article will establish such a relationship. It will show that phenomena that have been con-
sidered as basic properties of nature are rather natural properties of basic informational structures.

II. FROM BITS TO SPINORS

Let us start with a set B of bits z that can attain two states denoted by 0 and 1:

B = {z | z ∈ {0, 1}}.

(1)

The elements z are distinguished only by their states 0 and 1, but are indistinguishable otherwise.
If they were, this would require additional features, which they do not have by deﬁnition. These
bits can carry information, similar to the bits in a computer memory.

In the following we will meet subsets of B that will be used to form “macroscopic setups”. By
such setups I mean subsets of, say 1023 bits that are suited to carry information about a macroscopic
physical body. Then B shall be considerably larger and contain, say 1080 bits.

In the spirit of Bohr’s dictum, I intend to describe an elementary physical phenomenon, represented
by a single bit, relative to an experimental setup. This setup can be described by macroscopic setups
- at least in a “gedanken” experiment. But what is the meaning of a bit relative to a macroscopic
setup? This question, obviously, leads us to a kind of relativity of information. The extension of the
notion of relativity to the simplest informational unit will, in the following, proof extremely fertile.
To implement this concept we need to establish a simple mathematical language based on the

elementary properties of bits.

I start by representing bits by states in vector form

|1i := 

and |0i := 



.

(2)

0









Then with the matrix

we can set up a simple eigenvalue equation

where |zi is either |1i or |0i, and where ζ are the corresponding eigenvalues 1 and −1, respectively.
I also deﬁne the expectation value of σ3 by

where hz| stands for the transposed vector. This simply gives the orientation of z.

Another matrix

applied to |1i or |0i, changes |1i to |0i and |0i to |1i. Since none of the two orientations is preferred,
σ1 deﬁnes a discrete symmetry transformation within the states |0i and |1i.

Often information is uncertain or incomplete. Therefore, we must be able to describe situations,
where we only know with a certain likelihood that the bit is in state |1i rather than |0i. I handle
this situation by considering also linear combinations

where α and β are complex numbers with the restriction that

I will call such a mixed state a (two-component) spinor. By this step I have introduced a complex
vector space with |1i and |0i as basic vectors.

With a scalar product between two states |s1i and |s2i

I extend the vector space to a Hilbert space. In the language of quantum computing this Hilbert
space is called a Q-bit. By the introduction of Q-bits we have obtained states that “interpolate”
between the orientations of a classical bit or C-bit.

In the Hilbert space we can perform some mathematical operations that are not possible in the
discrete binary description. We can, for example, consider the algebra of the matrices σ1 and σ3
with respect to the commutator product. Then, from the commutator, we obtain a third matrix σ2

σ3 := 

1 0
0 −1







σ3|zi = ζ|zi,

hz|σ3|zi = ζ,

σ1 := 

0 1

|si = α |1i + β |0i,

α∗α + β∗β = 1.

σ2 = 



.



(11)

σ1, σ2 and σ3 are the well-known Pauli matrices, which satisfy the commutation relations of the
Lie algebra of SU(2). Therefore, they generate SU(2) transformations within the Hilbert space of
two-component spinors. These symmetry transformations are continuous, but they are a direct
consequence of the discrete symmetry property of the basic states.

III. FOUNDATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

I have just extended the notion of a classical bit or C-bit to the quantum mechanical concept
of a Q-bit. One part of the quantum aspect has come from the fact that the elementary units of
information are discrete or “quantized”. The other part has come from the requirement to describe
fragmentary information, which has led us to a Hilbert space. This gives us the required means to
describe relations within a set of bits which carry information. Let us see how we can make use of
it.

As known from the quantum mechanics of angular momenta, spinors can be coupled to states
with deﬁned angular momenta. The coupling of two spinors delivers, after reduction with respect to
SU(2), either a simple state with angular momentum 0 or three states with angular momentum 1. If
we couple a great number of spinors, we ﬁnally come to the classical limit, where the total state can
be freely orientated in three angular directions. Therefore, the symmetry group of the total Hilbert
space is SO(3).

In this way the Hilbert space allows us to build macroscopic setups - macrosystems for short - that
behave like classical rigid bodies. It also delivers parameters, in this case the three spatial angles,
for a “classical” description of macrosystems.

Let us now perform the following gedanken experiment: Assume that we have built a macrosystem
that can be used as an experimental setup in the sense of Bohr’s dictum. Then “diﬀerent” setups can
be generated by diﬀerent angular orientations of the setup. Now adjust a single spinor in parallel
orientation to the setup. Then turn the setup by applying a SO(3) rotation by 90 degrees.
If
we turn the coordinate system together with the setup, then the spinor state will be rotated by a
corresponding SU(2) transformation. As a result the spinor state then consists of equal parts of
states |1i and |0i.

Now try to “measure” the orientation of the spinor relative to the rotated setup. Even without
knowing details of the measuring process, we can deduce from symmetry reasons that the result of
the measurement will be undetermined. That means, if we repeat the experiment a great number of
times, we will observe a parallel orientation with a likelihood of 50% and an anti-parallel orientation
with another 50%. This is exactly what the spinor state tells us, when we interpret the coeﬃcients
of the basic states as probability amplitudes.

4

Another turn by 90 degrees brings the spinor into an anti-parallel position relative to the setup.
Now its orientation is again well-deﬁned. Thanks to our deﬁnition of mixed states the spinor state
will deliver the same result. This is only possible since the mixed states have been deﬁned as a
coherent superposition of the basic states.

So our gedanken experiment has displayed two characteristic properties of a quantum mechanical
system, namely indeterminism and coherence. Both have shown up as natural properties of an
informational structure - not as a peculiar property of nature. To use Bohr’s words [9]:

“There is no quantum world. There is only an abstract quantum mechanical description.”

The quantum mechanical description of a set of bits shows the following important properties:

• Firstly and somewhat surprisingly,

freedom to describe
macrosystems; we have found three angular degrees of freedom by which a macrosystem can be
rotated.

it delivers “classical” degrees of

• Secondly, it allows a description of microscopic elements relative to randomly orientated macro-

scopic setups; this is the quantum mechanical aspect.

• Finally, it deﬁnes symmetry properties by elements of a Lie group: we have obtained SU(2),

with respect to single spinors, and SO(3) in the context of macrosystems.

IV. DIRAC SPINORS AND DE SITTER GROUP

We are on the way to constructing a mathematical model of binary information about reality.
Remember: a model of information, not of reality itself. Nevertheless, we hope that understanding
the information about reality will give us a reasonable picture of reality itself.

Obtaining information about a binary phenomenon with possible values a and b, involves an
isomorphism between the set {a, b} and the informational structure that is modelled by the set of
states {|1i, |0i}. There are exactly two such isomorphisms:

and

a → |1i, b → |0i

a → |0i, b → |1i.

(12)

(13)

There is no reason why any one of these mappings should be preferred to the other. In observing one
and the same phenomenon with a certain experimental setup, mapping (12) may apply, in another
setup possibly (13). Therefore, both mappings must be taken into account. Otherwise, we risk
loosing certain information or map it in a wrong way. This would be fatal for our picture of reality
that we hope to gain from the information.

To include both mappings we have to extend the mathematics that we have developed so far. This
is easily done by combining a two-component spinor representing mapping (12), with a second one
that represents mapping (13). The combination results in four-component basic vectors:

Vectors |ui represent information obtained by mapping (12), vectors |vi information by mapping
(13).

Again I introduce an interpolating Hilbert space and obtain four-component spinors that I will

call Dirac spinors for obvious reasons. In place of Pauli matrices we now have 4 × 4 matrices:

σij := ǫijk 



, i, j, k = 1, 2, 3,

σk 0
0 σk



where ǫijk is the total anti-symmetric permutation symbol. The matrix

where I is the 2 ×2 unit matrix, has the eigenvalue +1 with respect to the ﬁrst group of basic spinors
(14), and −1 with respect to the second (15).

Analogous to σ1, I deﬁne the matrix

which interchanges the ﬁrst group with the second. Since both mappings are treated in the same
way, this operation again is a symmetry operation. Then also the combined application of σ1 and τ
is a symmetry operation. It is generated by the matrix

When we consider the algebra of matrices γ0, γ1 and σij with respect to the commutator product,

we obtain additional matrices

To obtain a Hilbert space, I deﬁne a scalar product, which is known from Dirac’s theory of electrons,

which are obtained from Dirac matrices, form an irreducible representation of the de Sitter group
SO(3,2) on the Hilbert space of Dirac spinors. The proof is by verifying the commutation relation
of SO(3,2)

[sµν, sρσ] = −i[gµρsνσ − gµσsνρ + gνσsµρ − gνρsµσ] ,

[sµ4, sν4] = −isµν ,

[sµν, sρ4] = i[gνρsµ4 − gµρsν4].

SO(3,2) symmetry transformations are a direct consequence of the discrete symmetry operations
within the four-component basic states. They extend these operations to the interpolating Hilbert
space of Dirac spinors. A subgroup of SO(3,2) is the homogeneous Lorentz group SO(3,1) with
commutation relations (26). The common subgroup SO(3) corresponds to the SU(2) symmetry of
the two-component parts of the Dirac spinor.

We have obtained SO(3,2) as a natural symmetry group of an informational structure made up
of a large number of bits. This result is based on the concept of a description of bits relative
to macroscopic setups, using a Hilbert space formalism, and on the equal treatment of both spin
orientations and of both mappings between phenomenon and informational structure.

V. POINCAR´E GROUP AND SPACE-TIME

Now it is only a small step to the Poincar´e group. Consider again a macroscopic setup and its
states with large quasi-continuous quantum numbers. Suppose that we have adjusted the states in
such a way that the expectation values of the operators Sµ4 are large compared to those of Sµν. (The
operators S are deﬁned as a sum over s of the individual spinors. Capital letters denote operators
and states of macrosystems.)

Then we can apply the methods of group contraction [10,11] to this segment of the Hilbert space
and obtain the Poincar´e group P(3,1) as an approximate symmetry group. We can verify this by
inspecting the commutator (27) under these conditions: When Sµ4 is large compared to Sµν, the
commutator can be approximated by

where the operators Pµ are the approximations to Sµ4.

From (28) we obtain the commutation relations of Pµ with the generators of Lorentz transforma-

[Pµ, Pν] = 0,

[Sµν, Pρ] = i[gνρPµ − gµρPν].

(26), (29) and (30) are the commutation relations of the Poincar´e group.
continuous quantum numbers of SO(3,2) we now have the continuous spectrum of Pµ.

In place of the quasi-

We can use the eigenstates of Pµ to construct new states |Xi that are localised in space-like

When applied to these states, Pµ generate translations by 4-vectors aµ

|Xi := (2π)−3/2

eiaµPµ |Xi = |X + ai.

The 4-vectors aµ span a 4-dimensional space-time with Minkowskian metric.

We thereby obtain the 3-dimensional space as a set of possible displacements, in the sense of

Poincar´e (“La science et l’hypoth`ese”) and Einstein [12], who followed Poincar´e in this respect.

It is remarkable, that we obtain space-time not as an independent phenomenon, but as a property

of macroscopic bodies. That means: in the absence of bodies space-time is not deﬁned.

Minkowskian space-time is an approximation obtained by group contraction that is valid for the
neighbourhood of a given point in space-time. The fact that it is an approximation only, has
implications that will be discussed below.

The quantum mechanical consequences of deﬁnition (31) are wave properties and the well-known

commutation relations of momentum and position.

VI. PARTICLES IN SPACE-TIME

What is the relationship of a single spinor to the space-time structure of macrosystems? Of course,
a spinor does not possess any other degree of freedom than the orientation of its spin. Nevertheless,
its relation to a macrosystem can be used to deﬁne space-time properties for a spinor.

Consider a macrosystem of N spinors with total momentum P . Then add another spinor to the
system. Within the Poincar´e approximation we then obtain a macrosystem of N + 1 spinors with

8

a slightly diﬀerent momentum P + ps. We can say: relative to the macrosystem the spinor has a
momentum ps, which may depend on the spin s of the spinor.

This can be done relative to any other macrosystem. Then the momentum ps will appear like a
property of the spinor itself. Therefore, it makes sense to introduce an auxiliary Hilbert space made
up by momentum states ps, and formally associate this Hilbert space with an additional degree of
freedom of the spinor. But we should keep in mind that these degrees of freedom are only “borrowed”
from the relation of the spinor to a macrosystem.

Since ps is obtained as a diﬀerence of momenta of a macrosystem, these momenta transform
identically to those of a macrosystem with respect to the Poincar´e group. Therefore, we can form
localised states or wave packets relative to a macrosystem A and let them “travel” in space and
time. If on their way they meet another macrosystem B, they can again form a common state with
B. As a part of B the spinor again has a well-deﬁned momentum ps.

On the way from A to B the wave packet has to be regarded as an interpolating state, in the
same sense as a spinor state interpolates between the two basic spin states. But, because of energy-
momentum conservation for the total system, even an interpolating state attains a certain degree
of reality, in the sense that it transports energy-momentum from A to B. This can be probed by
inserting a third macrosystem C in between A and B.

C may be a screen with two slits. Then the spinor may “hit” the screen, but if it does not, its
momentum relative to C is undeﬁned. Therefore, we cannot talk about trajectories of the spinor
moving from A to B. Consequently, it does not make sense to ask through which slit the spinor has
passed.

We can more clearly deﬁne this concept by asking how the momentum diﬀerences are connected
to the spin. Within the framework of the exact SO(3,2) symmetry, macrosystem and single spinor
are described by SO(3,2) operators acting on states |Si and |si. For example:

Within the Poincar´e approximation, Sµ4 is replaced by Pµ:

Based on the above considerations, within the Poincar´e approximation there is also a representation
in the form

Therefore, a relationship

between momentum ps and spin s must exist. This relationship must be covariant with respect to
P(3,1). Let us ﬁrst look for an invariant operator expression which is linear in both characteristic
operators pµ and sµ4 and that is applicable to the state |psi. The only invariant that satisﬁes these
requirements is γµpµ. Applied to |psi we obtain

(Sµ4 + sµ4)|Si|si.

(Pµ + sµ4)|P i|si.

(Pµ + pµ)|P i|psi.

sµ4|si ⇐⇒ pµ|psi

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

with a constant m. This is Dirac’s equation with “mass” m. As we know, the solutions of Dirac’s
equation deﬁne a current ¯ψ(x)γµψ(x), which transforms in the same way as a momentum pµ. Current,
deﬁned by the spin operator γµ, and momentum are linked by Dirac’s equation. This is the relation
we have been looking for.
From (37) we obtain

(γµpµ − m)|psi = 0

pµpµ = m2.

(37)

(38)

Since pµ describes the eﬀect of adding 1
2γµ to the momentum operator of a macrosystem, pµpµ is
closely related to 1
4 γµγµ, which has a ﬁxed value of 1. This provides us with a scale for the value of
the mass m. The scale is dimensionless and is deﬁned in units of quantum numbers. Values in units
of a mass will be obtained, when we decide about a unit for the momentum.

As we know, the Dirac equation allows for massive and massless solutions. Details of these solutions
can be found in text books. Therefore, the coupling of a Dirac spinor to a macrosystem can result
in two distinct conﬁgurations: massive ones that can be transformed into the rest frame of the
macrosystem and massless conﬁgurations that move with the speed of light. Poincar´e symmetry
ensures that these conﬁgurations are stable with respect to translations in space and time.

What can we say about the statistics of these “particles”? We already know that spinors cannot
be distinguished except by the spin variable. Therefore, a state of two spinors does not change,
except for the sign, when the spinors are interchanged. The interchange of spinors in space-time can
be performed by a rotation of 180 degrees with respect to a symmetry axis of the system. A simple
calculation delivers a phase factor i for each spinor. The total state therefore is changed by a factor
of −1. Therefore, the particles are subjected to Fermi statistics. (This derivation of Pauli’s principle
goes back to A. A. Broyles [13] in 1976. Later it was used, obviously independently, by Feynman
and Weinberg [14].)

We have arrived at the result that spinors, when observed in relation to macrosystems, show

properties of spin-1/2 fermions in space-time.

VII. WHAT IS TIME?

In section IV the usage of four-component spinors has been justiﬁed by the existence of two

isomorphisms. What is the exact meaning of these isomorphisms?

Let us, for a moment, go back to two-component spinors. Consider a single two-component spinor
with spin s and a macroscopic set of such spinors, forming a state with angular momentum S. There
are two ways to couple s and S, namely “s parallel to S” and “s anti-parallel to S”. Therefore,
relative to the macroscopic state, the spinor exhibits another degree of freedom with two possible
settings. Obviously, this degree of freedom is diﬀerent from the spin degree of freedom, because by
rotating s together with S the spin is changed, but the way of coupling is not. In an environment,
where we can be certain that macrosystems are unambiguously built from states of “positive energy”,

10

it makes sense to regard this degree of freedom as a matter of the spinor itself, rather than of the
relation between spinor and macrosystem. Analogous to the last section, we can describe this
additional degree of freedom, without reference to the macroscopic state, by incorporating it into
the spinor state. We have already done this in section IV by doubling the spinor components from
two to four. The ﬁrst two components then describe the parallel, the second two the anti-parallel
coupling. We now understand that the two isomorphisms describe the same spinor, but in diﬀerent
ways of coupling to macrosystems.

The equal treatment of both spin orientations requires that both couplings are equally treated.

Therefore, four-component spinors are, in general, an indispensable requirement.

The coupling degree of freedom is described by the eigenvalues {+1, −1} of γ0. In macrosystems
the individual γ0-matrices add up to the energy operator.
In Dirac’s equation the eigenvalues
of γ0 discriminate between solutions of positive and negative energy.
In going to a space-time
representation by a Fourier transformation (cf.(31)) we obtain, associated with positive and negative
energy, wave functions running forward and backward in time. This allows to discriminate between
“before” and “after”, which means time in its most elementary form.

So we ﬁnd the roots of time in the two ways of coupling of a two-component spinor to a macrosys-

tem, which again is a consequence of the two possible orientations of a bit.

VIII. MASS SPECTRUM

Consider a macrosystem composed of two subsystems forming a state with momentum P

|P i =

Z

d3q c(q) |P1 − qi |P2 + qi.

(39)

The two subsystems are linked by the exchange of three components of momentum q, or more
general, by three linearly independent momenta. Alternatively, we can construct the state |P i by
combining three or even four subsystems, as indicated by

|P i =

dq1dq2dq3 c(q) |P1 − (q1, q2, q3)i |P2 + (q1, 0, q3)i |P3 + (0, q2, 0)i

(40)

Z

and

Z

|P i =

dq1dq2dq3 c(q) |P1 − (q1, q2, q3)i |P2 + (q1, 0, 0)i |P3 + (0, q2, 0)i |P4 + (0, 0, q3)i.

(41)

The three independent momentum components act like the valences in chemistry, allowing to link
the ﬁrst subsystem to a maximum of three other subsystems.

In deriving the space-time properties of spinors we have considered the direct product of a spinor

and a macrosystem state in the form

(42)

(cf. (33) - (35)). This corresponds to a linkage of type (39). It is only consequent, when we consider
also alternative forms corresponding to linkages (40) and (41), as indicated by

|P i |si

11

(43)

(44)

(45)

and

|P ′i |P ′′i |si

|P ′i |P ′′i |P ′′′i |si.

Here P ′, P ′′ and P ′′′ shall be associated with disjoint subsets of the total set of spinors. Let

P = P ′ + P ′′ or P = P ′ + P ′′ + P ′′′ resp..

Then these states are characterised, like (42), by a single momentum P . But now the spinor is
correlated with more than one macrosystem.

The structures (42), (43) and (44) are distinguished by the multiplicity of states that can be
constructed for a given P . In this sense (43) deﬁnes a “larger” system than (42), and (44) a larger
system than (43). Usually, larger systems react with more inertia to changes of momentum than
smaller systems. Can we, therefore, associate some kind of eﬀective inert mass to these structures,
that is related to the multiplicity of states?

Mass formula based on multiplicities of states have been known for more than three decades. In
1971 A. Wyler [15] found such a relation between electron and proton mass. In the 1980s F. D. Smith
[16] presented mass relations, based on an algebraic particle model for virtually all particles known at
that time. Recently G. Gonz´alez-Mart´in [17] (G-M in the following) has described detailed algebraic
methods to derive mass relations, starting from a universal structure group SL(4,R). G-M’s idea is
that the structure group describes a “substrate” from which particles are generated as “excitations”
with certain symmetric and topological properties that are associated with subgroups of the structure
group.

These algebraic methods were often considered as “pure numerology”, since their relationship to

conventional physical concepts remained unclear.

In the following we will establish a connection between our approach and the algebraic methods.
This will shed light into the physical backgrounds of these methods. In fact, we can draw parallels
to G-M’s approach, when we identify the set of spinors with G-M’s substrate and the couplings
(42), (43) and (44) with G-M’s excitations. The couplings (43) and (44) then correspond to G-M’s
topological excitations.

G-M derives a mass formula for the three lepton families:

mn = 4π

me

n = 1, 2 ,

(46)

16π

n

(cid:18)

3 (cid:19)

where me is the electron mass and m1 is related to the myon mass and m2 to the tauon mass.
With the experimental electron mass of 0.5109989 MeV, G-M obtains mµ = 107, 5916 MeV and
mτ = 1770, 3 MeV. These values speak for the physical relevance of the method. (The experimental
values are 105, 658 and 1776, 99.)

To come to an understanding of the basic mechanism of algebraic mass relations, consider the mass
equation in a ﬁctitious higher dimensional space-time structure, say in (9+1)-dimensional space-time,

0 − p2

1 − p2

2 − p2

3 − p2

4 − p2

Assume that three space-like momenta at a time are projected onto the same momentum in (3+1)
space-time. Then we obtain

0 − P 2
p2

1 − P 2

2 − P 2

3 = m2
0,

where P1 is the projection of p1, p2, p3 and P2 the projection of p4, p5, p6 and so on. If we add a
momentum ∆p to P1, this momentum may be added either to p1 or p2 or p3.
If we look at the
change of p0 when a certain pi is changed, we obtain from (47), under the simplifying condition that
p0 ≈ m0,

∆p0 =

∆p.

pi
m0

∆p0 =

pi
3 m0

∆p

Observe that the change of p0 by adding ∆p is weighted by the current value of pi. If we continue to
add momenta to P1 and equally distribute the momenta among all three p1, p2, p3, then the current
value of each pi will be only 1/3 of the value in a basically (3+1)-dimensional space-time. Then for
repeatedly adding momenta to P1 with a statistical distribution to all three pi, the relation

holds instead of (49). This means: the multiplicity of states in (9+1) space-time, relative to the
multiplicity in (3+1), multiplies the mass m0 to give an “eﬀective mass” of 3 m0. The factor 3 is
obtained as the quotient of dimension 9 and dimension 3.

In our approach the number of linear independent states is determined by the group SO(3,2).
Locally SO(3,2) is approximated by P(3,1). This approximation maps the states of a representa-
tion S of SO(3,2) into states of a representation L of the Lorentz group SO(3,1). By applying a
transformation L of SO(3,1) on a given state of S we can generate other states, connected to the
original one by a boost transformation. Following G-M, the states obtained in this way will be called
L-equivalent. The group S of transformations of the de Sitter group is larger

than L. Therefore, for each state of S other states exist that are mapped onto the same state of L,
but are not L-equivalent. The classes of unequivalent states correspond to cosets aL, a ∈ S. These
cosets form the factor group S/L. The factor group is a symmetric space, which can be assigned a
volume. The algebraic method determines the multiplicity of states that are mapped onto the same
state of L by calculating such volumes.

The volume assigned to S/L is given by [19]

This means: each state of L is obtained from the corresponding representation of SO(3,2) with a
multiplicity of L-unequivalent states given by (51). Accordingly, the multiplicity of the states (43)
and (44) is given by

Since we want to determine mass relations, as a next step we have to relate the multiplicities
of (52) to a basic multiplicity that is associated to the electron mass. Masses are properties of
representations of PO(3,1) and these are obtained by contracting representations of SO(3,2). The
act of contraction has a further inﬂuence on the multiplicity of states. It can be described by another
volume factor. Consider ﬁrst the factor group P/L, where P are the transformations of P(3,1). The
number of its cosets is determined by the group of translations U(1) with a volume of V (U(1)) = 4π
[17]. The volume factor, we are looking for, is then given by

Therefore, each state of a representation P of P (3, 1) that is obtained by contracting a state of S has
a basic multiplicity of 4/3. In a sense this can be considered as a multiplicity of “P-unequivalent”
states. When we divide the terms in (52) by this factor, we obtain multiplicities relative to the basic
multiplicity of representation P

One might follow from (51) that electron states have a multiplicity of 4π relative to the basic
multiplicity of P. This conclusion is not unjustiﬁed, since this multiplicity is caused by the translation
degrees of freedom of the electron. But a translation, applied to a momentum eigenstate, delivers
a phase factor, which does not lead to a new, linear independent state. Therefore, electrons have
a multiplicity of 1 relative to P and its mass can be used as a reference mass corresponding to a
multiplicity of 1. When we multiply the electron mass with the multiplicity factors (54) we obtain
mass relations that are identical to G-M’s in (46).

These considerations apply, in principle, also to the massless solutions of the Dirac equation.
Therefore, we can say that each massive lepton is accompanied by a massless, neutrino-like lepton.
In structures (42), (43) and (44) we have exhausted all possibilities within a 3-dimensional mo-
mentum space, to link a spinor to macrosystems. This means that there are only three families of
leptons.

The good agreement of these mass relations with the experiment can be regarded as an empirical
justiﬁcation of our concept, which derives space-time properties of spinors from their coupling to
macrosystems.

In the papers [15–17] mass relations are not restricted to leptons. We can expect that the algebraic

methods will give us further valuable hints to other, eventually more complex, particle structures.

The approximation of the de Sitter group by the Poincar´e group has revealed three families of
free particles with the properties of leptons. An essential property of massive leptons, their electric
charge, has not yet been addressed. This property is connected with the notion of interaction.

IX. INTERACTION

14

We will approach this notion by reconsidering the validity of the Poincar´e approximation for a
single spinor. On closer examination we ﬁnd that, in contrast to macrosystems, for single spinors this
approximation is dubious, for the following reasons: With reference to the validity of the Poincar´e
approximation for macrosystems we have associated a momentum to a single spinor. But the spin
degree of freedom still transforms by a transformation generated from the spin operator 1

2 γµ.

The corresponding transformation of the associated momentum is generated by the momentum
operator pµ. This means, that for a spinor the generator of translations contains a γµ-term besides
the pµ-term. In the literature about group contraction, e.g. [11], the γµ-term is considered small
compared to pµ and of zeroth order in the contraction limit. In our context pµ describes the eﬀect of
adding a spinor to a macrosystem. Therefore, the expectation values of pµ and 1
2γµ are of the same
order. As a consequence, the Poincar´e approximation cannot generally be applied to a single spinor.
We can make the best of this situation by keeping the Poincar´e approximation as a basic theory.
Then we have to treat those terms that disturb the validity of this approximation as “perturbations”,
using a suitable quantum mechanical perturbation algorithm. In our case the operator 1
2 γµ is such a
term. It has been shown [20] that a perturbation treatment of the γµ-term gives rise to an interaction
between two massive leptons. This interaction is empirically and theoretically well-known: It has
the structure of the electromagnetic interaction and the perturbation theory is identical to quantum
electrodynamics. In other words: when we apply a standard perturbation algorithm, we ﬁnd ourselves
in the standard model.

In contrast to the standard model the strength of the interaction is determined by the theory.
An estimate of the coupling constant delivers a value that is identical to the empirical value of the
ﬁne-structure constant α [20]. In fact this estimate reproduces Wylers semi-empirical formula [21]
of 1969, without making use of his attempt to justify this formula. This means: our massive leptons
carry one elementary charge.

Now we are in a position to answer the question that we have raised at the beginning “Can we
observe the bits of particle physics?” in the positive sense: These bits show, when the are observed
relative to macroscopic setups, the properties of leptons.

Having started from the simplest and unspeciﬁc informational structure we have reached familiar
structures at the level of the standard model. This result is in stark contrast to the wide-spread
opinion that the most elementary physical structures have to be searched for at Planck scales.

On closer examination, further perturbation terms can be identiﬁed. Based on their characteristics
they have been assigned to the remaining interactions [20]. Remarkably, this includes a gravitation
type of interaction. The corresponding perturbation term gives clear guidelines for the formulation
of a perturbation theory, that has a good chance to result in a consistent theory of quantum gravity.

Several authors have expressed the opinion that a fundamental theory should be able to derive

space-time and quantum mechanics at the same time from more general principles.

With Bohr’s help I have presented such principles. They are:

X. R´ESUM´E

15

1. Physics means the acquiring and processing of information about reality.

2. The subject of particle physics is the study of the smallest building blocks of information.

3. The acquisition of information is done relative to macroscopic setups.

These principles are not what we usually understand by “ﬁrst principles”. They simply describe
what we are doing when we practise particle physics. In fact, they can be regarded as a matter of
course, since every attempt to build a theoretical model of our information about reality, must be
orientated at, which kind of information is considered and how this information is acquired.

The ﬁrst principle deﬁnes the general subject of theoretical physics:

it concerns the information
about reality. We collect information, link information by theoretical models and derive further
information from these models.

The second principle leads to the basic building blocks of information, called bits, which set the

fundament for basic symmetry properties.

handle “relative” information.

The third principle takes us to the quantum mechanical description as a mathematical tool to

This description ﬁnally leads, together with the mentioned symmetry properties, to a relativis-
tic space-time continuum and to particles with a mass spectrum identical to the empirical lepton
spectrum.

Higher order terms then generate four fundamental interactions.
These conclusions have been obtained without consulting any “law of nature”. We have only
presumed that both settings of a bit have to be equally treated. We further have employed a Hilbert
space to describe mixed states. In addition to this, the only “laws” that have entered are the laws
of mathematical logic and these are clear and comprehensible.

The decision for a Hilbert space description has provided us with a formal language that allows to
express relations within a bit structure in well-known terms of theoretical physics. The introduction
of the Hilbert space does not imply any additional assumption. It only serves to clearly formulate
properties of bit sets. This decision is of pragmatic nature and can be justiﬁed only a posteriori. Its
sense is measured by the capability to lead to such structures that can be compared with empirical
ones. Looking back, we can say that this decision has made sense, since it has led us to a space-time
continuum equipped with particles and an electromagnetic interaction. The interaction allows us to
measure the properties of this space-time continuum, and thereby give it physical reality.

We come to the following understanding: Physical reality, as seen by a particle physicist, is not the
outcome of a “fundamental law of nature”, but an inevitable logical consequence of the way we look
at reality. It seems almost a triviality, that, when we look at more and more elementary informational
structures, we ﬁnally have to arrive at binary units of information. Obviously, in particle physics we
have reached this situation. However, our view into the basic structures is masked by the necessity
of relative observation. The properties of this mask, represent what we have learned to regard as
“laws of nature”. But now we can say that these laws are the result of mathematical logic only and
not of any “ﬁrst principle”.

16

The structure behind the “mask” represents the most elementary and most general structure to
take up information. There is nothing speciﬁc to “particle physics” in this structure. Nevertheless,
we have found that the elements of these structure, when observed through the mask of relative
observation, show all properties of leptons. We have to conclude that leptons (possibly together
with quarks) represent the most elementary structures of physics. But what makes these structures
turn into particles, is the result of an observation through the “relativistic mask”.

With these structures the search for more and more elementary building blocks, which has charac-
terised physics in the past one hundred years, has ﬁnally come to an end. Since bits are the smallest
pieces of information, there is nothing beyond this level that can contribute to our knowledge of
reality. Therefore, this limit does not restrict in any way our search for an understanding of those
parts of reality, that we are able to access by physical experiments. On the contrary, here we ﬁnd a
clear and well-deﬁned basic structure, with the potential to base on it an elementary particle theory
that will lead us well beyond the standard model. We have good reasons to believe that this theory
will include gravitation.

To conclude I would like to remind you of another famous dictum of Bohr’s:

Dimension of Holes and High-Temparature
Condensate in Bose-Einstein Statistics

V.P.Maslov∗

Abstract

We introduce the notion of weight for the lattice dimension and the notion of
topological dimension – hole dimension. The condensate in Bose–holes exists in the
case when temperature is not low.

In our previous papers we applied the quantum statistics approach to linguistic statis-

tics [1].

To each word a frequency dictionary assigns its number of occurrences in the corre-
sponding corpus of texts. There may be several words with the same number of occur-
rences.

The rank of a word (i.e., the order number of a word in a frequency dictionary) is
measured from the word A1 with the highest number of occurrences s in a given corpus
of texts. The number of all words with the same number of occurrences i we designate
as Ni. Then, if Am is the last word in a list of words with number of occurrences m (the
words of the same number of occurrences can be arranged in an arbitrary way), then the
rank rm of Am is obviously

s

rm =

Ni.

i=m

There is an analogy between the Bose particles at the energy level of an oscillator λi = i
and the words with the occurrence number i, namely, the words with the same occurrence
number can be ordered in an arbitrary way, say, alphabetically, inversely alphabetically,
or in any other order. The indexing of the ranks (the indices) of words within the family
of a given occurrence number is arbitrary. In this sense, the words are indistinguishable
and are distributed according to the Bose statistic.

However, there is a diﬀerence between the approaches under consideration.

In the
frequency dictionary one evaluates the number of occurrences of every word and then
orders the words, beginning with the most frequently occurring words.

When there were no computers, it was diﬃcult for a person to evaluate the number
of words with equal occurrence number. By looking at a page as if it were a picture, a
person can determine a desired word on this page by its graphical form at every place of
occurrence of the word. In this case, the person looks at a page of the text as if it were a
photo, without going into the meaning. Similarly, if a person looks for a deﬁnite name in
a long list of intrants who had entered a college, this person ﬁnds (or does not ﬁnd) the
desired name by eyes rather than reads all the names one after another.

An eye gets into the way of recognizing the desired image, and this ability intensiﬁes
as the viewed material increases: the more pages the eye scans, the less is the diﬃculty

in ﬁnding the desired graphical form. Therefore, under a manual counting, it was simpler
to recognize the desired word on a page without reading the text and to cross it out by a
pencil, simultaneously counting the number of occurrences of the word. This procedure
is repeated for any subsequent word, already using the text with the words crossed out
(“holes”), which facilitates the search. In other words, the procedure is in the recognition
of the image of the given word, similar to the recognition, say, of a desired mushroom
in a forest without sorting out all the plants on the soil one after another. An ordinary
computer solves problems of this kind by exhaustion, whereas a quantum computer (see [2,
3]) makes this by recognizing the image.

However, for an ordinary computer, the number of operations needed to ﬁnd the
occurrence frequency of a word is less than the number of operations needed to ﬁnd the
number of words in the text with a given occurrence frequency.

One can say that the number of mushrooms we gathered (took away from the forest) is
the number of holes we left in the forest. Similarly, the words we had “got out” from the
text in the above way is an analog of holes rather than particles. Therefore, the linguists
count the rank of words starting from the opposite end as compared to the starting end
which would be used by physicists. The physicists would count the particles starting
from the lowest level, whereas the holes, the absent electrons, would be counted from the
highest level.

For this reason, the words in a frequency dictionary are associated with holes rather
than particles. Correspondingly, the dimension in the distribution of frequency dictionar-
ies is to be chosen as a “hole” dimension (”Dirac’s hole”), which is negative.

We will prove a cumulative formula in which the densities coincide in shape with the
Bose–Einstein distribution. The diﬀerence consists only in that, instead of the set λn of
random variables or eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator, the Bose–Einstein formula
contains some of their averages over the cells [4]. In view of the theorem given below, one
can proof that the εi, which are averages of the energy λk at the ith cell, are nonlinear
averages in the sense of Kolmogorov [5].

As in [6], the values of the random variable λ1, . . . , λs are ordered in absolute value.
Some of the numbers λ1, . . . , λs may coincide. Then these numbers are combined adding
the corresponding ”probabilities”, i.e., the ratio of the number of “hits” at λi to the
general number of trials. The number of equal λi : λi = λi+1 = · · · = λi+k will be called
the multiplicity qi of the value λi. In our consideration, both the number of trials N and s
tend to inﬁnity.

Let Ni be the number of ”appearances” of the value λi : λi < λi+1, then

Now we consider the notion of the lattice dimension.
We consider a straight line, a plane, and a three-dimensional space. We separate
points i = 0, 1, 2, . . . on the line and points x = i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , y = j = 0, 1, 2, . . . on the
coordinate axes x, y on the plane. We associate this set of points (i, j) with the points on
the straight line (with the positive integers l = 1, 2 . . . ) up to the quantum constant χ of
the lattice.

According to M. Gromov’s deﬁnition [11], the asymptotic (topological) dimension of

this lattice is equal to two.

We associate each point with a pair of points i and j according to the rule i+j = l. The
number of such points nl is equal to l + 1. In addition, we assume that z = k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
on the axis, i.e., we set i + j + k = l. In this case, the number of points ql is equal to

ql =

(l + 1)(l + 2)

.

If we set λi = l in formula (4), then, in the three-dimensional case, each i is associ-
ated with (l+1)(l+2)
of mutually equal xl = l (these are the multiplicities or the ql−hold
degeneracies of the spectrum of the oscillator). Formula (4) in this special case becomes

(lattice).

If D > 1, then, as i → ∞, a condensation of a suﬃciently small perturbation occurs
in the spectrum of the oscillator and the multiplicities split, i.e., the spectrum becomes
denser as i increases. The fact that D is negative means that there is strong rarefaction
in the spectrum as i → ∞ (the constant in formula (31) must be suﬃciently large).

For non-positive integer D, the terms i = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , −D become inﬁnite. This
means that they are very large in the experiment, which permits determining the lattice
negative dimension corresponding to a given problem. We note that a new condensate
occurs, which is possible for small β.

Now we return to frequency dictionaries. A frequency dictionary is composed using
texts from a certain array. Each word in the dictionary is associated with the number of
its encounters in the original array of texts. We denote this number by ωi and the number
of words corresponding to this number of encounters by Ni. The sum of all Ni is equal to
the volume of the entire dictionary, and the sum of products ωini is equal to the volume
of the entire array of texts used to compose the dictionary.

The number of words encountered only once in the array of texts is approximately
equal to 1/3 of the entire frequency dictionary which the number of words equal to N.
So as N → ∞ this is the condensate. It follows from the above that D = −1 for the
dictionary. Hence, for β ≪ 1 and ν ∼ 1, we have

For the frequency of ”Japanese candles” of 30 stocks in the stock market (see [13]),

the dimension is equal to 0.

Figures 1 and 2 show the rank-frequency curves for Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace. In
Fig. 1, the low-frequency part of the dictionary is approximated by formula (32) as β = 0
(words with frequencies ¿ 3; r0 = 43408.8, α = 0.891995, and c1 = −189.321). For the
entire dictionary, Fig. 2 shows the deviation of the theoretical data from the dictionary
data (the diﬀerence between the frequency given in the dictionary and the frequency given
by the formula) against rank. The deviation is seen not to exceed 1.5 words if the rank is
larger than 300.

Examples of holes.
In the Frenkel’ theory of crystals, a hole (Dirac’s hole) is an absent electron, and it
behaves as a particle moving along the crystal. However, in contrast to an electron, this
particle cannot exist outside the crystal; there is no hole in vacuum. In the same way, a
hole, as we understand it, cannot exist without a suﬃciently large scale of spaces in which
it is “made.”

In fact, the fractal dimension of a hole, a crack in a rock, etc., depends on the scale at
which “our eye” distinguishes points. For instance, the coastline is of fractal nature when
observed from a plane. However, if we stand at the very coast, then this line is smooth,
and its dimension is equal to that of a smooth curve, i.e., to one.

When considering cracks in metal, the dimension depends on the resolving capacity
of the device used to observe the crack [14, 15, 16]. Denote the resolving capacity of the
device by κ. The usual deﬁnition of the Hausdorﬀ dimension is based on the condition
that some balls (as a rule, three-dimensional in practice) vanish. This means that the
volume Ω of the metal under consideration must be much greater than κ3. Thus, reducing
the problem to unit volume, we can see that the radius of the Hausdorﬀ ball1 ”tends to
zero” as Ω → ∞.

The hole–wave propagation is especially visual when considering elastic waves in media
in which the Young modulus is suﬃciently large with respect to compression and vanishes
with respect to extension. In particular, sand has this property. The waves-holes were
studied in detail by the author together with P. P. Mosolov in the case of one spatial
coordinate ([18], Appendix).

A worm corrodes a complicated serpiginous path-hole in the stem of a tree. This path
is very small with respect to the stem, and we can assume that the thickness of the stem
is inﬁnitely large as compared with the hole.

The dimension of a wire of the same thickness and the same “sinuosity” can be deﬁned
independently of the surrounding medium, whereas one cannot consider the hole (made
by the worm) beyond the stem, although both the dimensions have the same absolute
value.

Let us now present an economical example.

1That is, of the ball used in the deﬁnition of the Hausdorﬀ dimension, see [17].

On the closed interval 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 there is a scale 0 ≤ σ ≤ 1 of Cantor dust with
the Haar measure equal to xσ for any interval (0, x) similar to the entire given set of the
Cantor dust. The direct product of this scale by the Euclidean cube of dimension k − 1
gives the entire scale k + σ, where k ∈ Z and σ ∈ (0, 1). We consider the space of negative

dimension −D = −k − σ with respect to this very space. “Quantizing” of the densities
considered above leads to the density C D+l

The following problem arises further: How one can understand a scale of spaces in
speciﬁc problems on a crack whose dimension t increases as t → ∞? The size (volume)
of the metal or rock is not a dimension because all these objects are three-dimensional.
Where a suﬃciently large value of dimension arises?

For comparison, consider a gas in a three-dimensional vessel. Every molecule of gas
moves. The number of molecules is ≈ 1023. If a motion of every molecule is considered,
then, as a rule, one assumes that the entire dimension is equal to 1069.

On the other hand, one can consider all molecules as points of three-dimensional space.
If we also take into account the displacement at time t, then we can consider the points
in the four-dimensional space as well. This very duality enabled us (together with my co-
author P. P. Mosolov) to pass from the Newton equations for every molecule to equations
of ﬁeld-like hydrodynamics of the entire gas [19, 20].

If we choose two moments of time for the displacement of the molecules of gas in
the 1069-dimensional space, i.e., consider the displacement of all 1023 molecules as a single
point at the ﬁrst moment and as another point at the other moment, then we can introduce
the natural distance between these points, i.e., a metric.

One can construct a scale of metrics between this metric and the metric in three-

dimensional space by combining diverse groups of particles.

From the viewpoint of mechanics (elasticity theory) and the scales typical for this
science, metals, as well as rocks, consist of “grains” of suﬃciently small (rather than
atomic) measure–volume. These grains can be of diﬀerent size, and we can regard the set
of these grains as a point in the space of suﬃciently large dimension [21, 22]. This very
interpretation enables us to pass to the general deﬁnition of a fractal crack as a hole and
present the abstract mathematical deﬁnition.

General deﬁnition of spaces of negative negative dimension. Let Mt0 be a compactum,
of Hausdorﬀ dimension t0, which is an element of a t-parameter scale of mutually embed-
ded compacta, 0 < t < ∞. Two scales of this kind are said to be equivalent with respect
to the compactum Mt0 if all compacta in these scales coincide for any t ≥ t0. We say that
the compactum Mt0 is a hole in this equivalent set of scales and the number −t0 is the
negative dimension of this equivalence class.

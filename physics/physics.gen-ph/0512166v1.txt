A Dust Universe Solution to the Dark Energy
Problem

James G. Gilson j.g.gilson@qmul.ac.uk∗

Abstract

Astronomical measurements of the Omegas for mass density, cosmo-
logical constant lambda and curvature k are shown to be suﬃcient to
produce a unique and detailed cosmological model describing dark energy
inﬂuences based on the Friedman equations. A measurement for the equa-
tion of state omega is shown to be redundant in this theory as pressure
turns out to be identically zero at all epochs. This implies a theoretical
contradiction of the measured value for omega which is claimed to be ap-
proximately minus unity. The model has the characteristic of changing
from deceleration to acceleration at exactly half the epoch time at which
the input measurements are taken. This is a mysterious feature of the
model for which no explanation has so far been found. An attractive fea-
ture of the model is that the acceleration change time occurs at a red
shift of approximately 0.8 as predicted by the dark energy workers. Using
a new deﬁnition of dark energy density it is shown that the contribu-
tion of this density to the acceleration process is via a negative value for
the gravitational constant, -G, exactly on a par with gravitational mass
which occurs via the usual positive value for G. Because of the uniqueness
of the model derived here from general relativity and measurements of the
three Omegas, it is suggested that to ﬁnd a model incorporating the three
Omegas and omega would probably require going outside the structure of
general relativity theory.

1 introduction

The work to be described in this paper is the generation and study of the theory
that should go with the experimental work[1, 2] of the astronomers who claim
that their measurements indicate that the universe expansion is accelerating.
Assuming that this theory is based on the Friedman equations[15, 21], I have
found a solution to those equations that seems to be inevitable if the ideas put
forward by the dark energy workers are to be realized as a consequence of the
model. Very brieﬂy their main conclusion from observational astronomy is that
a universe expansion process is taking place now that changed from deceleration
to acceleration at some time tc in the past. This change is identiﬁed roughly
as occurring in association with events at a universe radius rc = r(tc) with an
observed red shift here and now in the range, 0.5 < z < 1.
I shall use the
subscript c as indicating the time of change from deceleration to acceleration.
They assume that the cosmological constant Λ is positive and deduce from
experiment that k = 0.

2 ACCELERATING MODEL

2 Accelerating Model

Using Friedman’s equations,

8πGρr2/3 = ˙r2 + (k − Λr2/3)c2

−8πGP r/c2 = 2¨r + ˙r2/r + (k/r − Λr)c2

in the case k = 0 and a positively valued Λ we have,

8πGρr2/3 = ˙r2 − |Λ|r2c2/3
−8πGP r/c2 = 2¨r + ˙r2/r − |Λ|rc2.

I deﬁne a radial length RΛ associated with Λ as

and use Rindler’s constant C,

RΛ = |3/Λ|1/2

C = 8πGρr3/3

to write the ﬁrst Friedman equation in the form,
˙r2 = C/r + (rc/RΛ)2.

Having the quantity, Rindler’s[15] constant C, in equation (2.7) ﬁxed at a
constant value turns out to be an important asset when we come to integrate
the Friedman equations. If as is usually taken to be the case, the mass density
function ρ is taken to be of uniform value throughout the universe at any given
epoch, t, though having a value that depends on epoch through r(t) as ρ(r(t))
and the quantity 4πr3/3 = VU (r) is interpreted as the total 3-dimensional vol-
ume of the universe when its radius is r, then the mass of the universe will be
given by

MU (r) = ρ(r)VU (r) = 4πr3ρ(r)/3

and then the constant C takes the form

C = 2MU (r)G.

From equation (2.9), it follows while C can be kept constant for variations
of the boundary radius r of the universe we can incorporate an r dependent
gravitation constant , G(r), provided an r dependent mass, MU (r), is suitably
chosen to conform with equation (2.9). This point will be returned to when

models in which all the mass of the universe is created at the big bang event
and thereafter keeps at a constant value MU , G must also keep at a constant
value if the equation (2.9) is to be retained for constant C. The equation (2.9)
can also be retained for constant C in cases where the mass of the universe is
generated over time provided a suitable time dependent G is incorporated to
keep C constant over time. Most of the work to follow applies to either of these
cases so that we do not need to specify which form of G is involved. However,
we do need to distinguish between the two cases if we wish to examine the mass
density function ρ of the universe explicitly.

Here the value of Hubble’s constant will be taken to be

H0 = 72 Km s−1 M pc−1

or in inverse seconds1

H0 = 2.333419756287 × 10−18 s−1.

From these values it follows that Rindler’s constant C has the form and value

RΛ = |3/Λ|1/2 = 1.483532963676604 × 1026.

It is convenient rearrange the ﬁrst Friedman equation (2.3) in the successive

the original ρ. Thus

forms,

or

8πGρr2/3 + Λr2c2/3 = ˙r2
8πGρr2/3 + 8πGρΛr2/3 = ˙r2

8πGρΛ = Λc2

ρΛ = Λc2/(8πG).

Thus in these terms the ﬁrst Friedman equation (2.3) becomes

8πG(ρ + ρΛ) = 3( ˙r/r)2 = 3H(t)2.

The second Friedman equation (2.4) can be written as

8πGr(−P/c2 + ρΛ) = 2¨r + ˙r2/r.

The introduction of the additional mass density ρΛ as in equation (2.22) to
explain the mathematical appearance or existence of the cosmological constant
Λ as a physical contributor to the theory is the usual approach. However, it
is not necessarily the best way of physically accounting for the cosmological
constant as the resulting equation (2.23) has the built in implication of putting
ρ and ρΛ on a par with respect to the kinematic quantity ( ˙r/r)2 = H(t)2 and
this may not be physically very relevant. An alternative approach with an
alternative density, ρ†

Λ, will be discussed later.

It follows from the deﬁnition (2.22) of ρΛ, that the mass density associated
with Λ has the same sign as does Λ itself which for some theory constructs
is taken as positive and in other theoretical constructs is taken as negative.
The negative mass density case does present conceptual diﬃculties. Using an
equation of state involving pressure is also conceptually diﬃcult in this context
because an equation of state of the form

for negative Λ and positive ω0 implies that the pressure P is also negative. For
positive Λ and negative ω0 it also implies that the pressure P is negative and is
the case that is used by the dark energy people. However, this negative pressure
is usually accommodated with some intellectual gymnastics. I shall show here
that such conceptual diﬃculties are avoided in the cosmological model to be
examined here. In the next section, I shall derive a solution to the Friedman
equations that can accommodate the essentials of the dark energy researchers
experimental values.

the exception of their measurement for ω0 at equation (2.13).

4 Characteristics of Model

The velocity, v(t) = ˙r(t) = dr(t)/dt, of expansion as a function of t is given by

v(t) = (RΛ/c)2/3C1/3(2/3) sinh−1/3(θ±(t))
× cosh(θ±(t))(±3c/(2RΛ))

= ±(Cc/RΛ)1/3 sinh−1/3(θ±(t)) cosh(θ±(t)).
= ±(bc/RΛ) sinh−1/3(θ±(t)) cosh(θ±(t)).

The acceleration a(t) = ˙v(t) = ¨r(t) is found to be

a(t) = ((c/RΛ)4/3C1/3/2)(3 sinh2/3(θ±)
− cosh2(θ±(t)) sinh−4/3(θ±(t)))

= b(c/(RΛ))2 sinh2/3(θ±(t))(3 − coth2(θ±(t)))/2

From equation (3.21) and equation (4.2), Hubble’s constant is given as a

function of t as

H(t) = ˙r/r =

±(Cc/RΛ)1/3 sinh−1/3(θ±(t)) cosh(θ±(t))

(4.10)

The measured value of H(t) is given by equation (2.15). Thus a consistent
value for time now, t0, is the time solution of (4.8) at (4.9) with a numerical
value in seconds at (4.10)

(c/RΛ) coth(±3ct/(2RΛ)) = 2.333419756287 × 10−18

t0 = (±2RΛ)/3c) coth−1((RΛ/c) × 2.333419756287 × 10−18)

= 4.34467334479058 × 1017

s.

using the value of RΛ from equation (2.18).

From the formula for the acceleration (4.3) it can be seen that there is a
time tc at which the acceleration changes from negative to positive given by the
time solution of (4.11) at (4.12)

cosh2(θ(t)) sinh−4/3(θ(t)) = 3 sinh2/3(θ(t))

tc = (2RΛ/(3c)) coth−1(31/2) = 2.172336672394881 × 1017.

(4.11)
(4.12)

From equations (4.17) and (3.21) we can ﬁnd the value of r0 = r(t0), the

radius of the universe formally at time-now as

r0 = (RΛ/c)2/3C1/3 sinh2/3(±3ct0/(2RΛ)).

(4.13)

The evaluation of which requires that we have a value for Rindler’s constant
C. However, an inspection of the deﬁnition for this constant equation (2.6)
shows that to know this constant we require knowing H0 for which I have as-
sumed an input value at equation (2.15) but it also requires knowing the present
radius of the universe r0 for which we have not got a measured value. There is
an alternative approach to ﬁnding the value for the present time, t0, and radius,
r0 = r(t0), of the universe and thus getting the appropriate value for Rindler’s
constant. From equations (2.6) and (2.10), we note that Rindler’s constant can
be expressed in the form

C = ΩM H †2r†3,

(4.14)

where I am now using the dagger superscript to denote the present day radius of
the universe and the present the present day value for Hubble’s constant. The
dagger notation is to emphasise the alternative route used to calculate quantities
such as r†. From equation (3.21) for r(t) it follows that

r†3 = (RΛ/c)2C sinh2(±3ct†/(2RΛ)).

(4.15)

The value for Rindler’s constant, C, from equation (4.14) can be substituted
into equation (4.15) to give

1 = 0.25(RΛ/c)2H †2 sinh2(3ct†/(2RΛ))

(4.16)

having cancelled the r†3 = r3(t†) that occurs on both sides of the equation.
Thus

± 1 = 0.5(RΛ/c)H † sinh(3ct†/(2RΛ)).

(4.17)

This can be solved for t†. Taking the plus sign with unity and using equation
(4.7) at time now as in (4.18).

4 CHARACTERISTICS OF MODEL

7

H † = H(t†) = (c/RΛ) coth(±3ct†/(2RΛ)).

(4.18)

It follows that the value of t† is given by the time solution of (4.19) as t† at

(4.20).

2 = cosh(θ(t†))
t† = (2RΛ/3c) cosh−1(2) = 4.344673344789258 × 1017 s.

(4.19)
(4.20)

Remarkably close to the value obtained for the original t0 displayed again

at equation (4.21).

t0 = 4.34467334479058 × 1017

s.

(4.21)

However, the value of t† was obtained without directly using the numerical
value of H at equation (4.6) although it does indirectly depend on H through
the value of RΛ so that it can be used to check the theoretical numerical value
of Hubble’s constant H † = H(t†) using the theoretical formula for H(t). Thus
the time t† is greater than tc, the acceleration change time by an amount

t† − tc = 2.172336672394881 × 1017 s = 6.888434400035 × 109 y.

(4.22)

The t† notation from now on will be used for time-now rather than the original t0
but this implies that the value of Hubble’s constant should be given by formula
(4.7) as

H(t†) = (c/RΛ) coth(±3ct†/(2RΛ)) = 2.333419756287 × 10−18 s−1.

(4.23)

Comparing this with the experimental value 2.333419756287 × 10−18 s−1 at
equation (2.15), we see that the value coming from this theory via the indirect
route through the value of RΛ is exactly the experimental value given at (2.15).
However, although we have found t† at formula (4.22), we still have not found
the value of r† = r(t†) that is necessary to ﬁnd Rindler’s constant C and the
constant b.
It seems that mathematically C is to be taken as arbitrary or
alternatively r† is to be taken as arbitrary or either C or r† is to be obtained
from experiment or further some other theoretical consideration needs to be used
to obtain one or other of these two key constants. There are values ascribed to r†
from astronomical observation based on a various speculative extrapolations and
which are therefore not greatly reliable see Gravitation[16] page 738, box(27.4). I
have here decided to use a value for r† that comes from an assumption about the
dependence of the gravitation constant on t† or on ct†. This assumption comes
from a suggestion about a formula for G in terms of other physical constants of
great numerical accuracy noticed by Ross McPherson, see references [14, 13].
His original suggestion had dimensions diﬀerent from G. A generalised version
of McPherson suggestion but which has the usual dimensions associated with
the gravitation constant G is as follows

G = ~2/(m2

pmect0),

(4.24)

where mp and me are the rest masses of the proton and electron respectively.
A formula similar to (4.24) for the gravitation constant was suggested by P. A.
Dirac[12] in the thirties. There are a number of ways in which this formula can

4 CHARACTERISTICS OF MODEL

8

be interpreted. Taking t0 to have one of values associated with the present age
of the universe gives a very accurate value for G[10, 17, 19]. Otherwise ct can
be given a value associated with the present radius of the universe r† multiplied
by cos(χG), the numerical constant, cos(χG) ≈ 1 coming from gravitational
I have used this last option to
coupling, which will also give a value for G.
develop a quantum theory for gravity[20, 11, 12] that successfully gives accurate
formulae conformable with Dirac’s large number hypothesis. This gives me some
conﬁdence in now inverting the formula (4.24) and using the measured value for
G to supply the missing numerical value for r† as

r† = ~2/(m2

pmeG),

(4.25)

where the numerical constant, cos(χG) ≈ 1, has been omitted as its values is
very close to unity at nearly all times. The situation when it could make some
signiﬁcant diﬀerence, at the start of expansion of the universe when t ≈ +0,
will be discussed in a future paper. The issues of reformulating quantum theory
so that it is consistent with the theory of stochastic processes, the quantization
of gravity theory and the consequent production of a quantized cosmology is
discussed in references [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The use of the formula (4.24) for G in
terms of quantum quantities in this work represents a weak partial quantization
of the structure. A more complete quantization will be discussed in a later
paper.

This can now be used to complete the numerical computation for the present
theory by using the value for r† in equation (4.23) to give us Rindler’s constant
C through equation (2.16) which is repeated below with r† replacing r0 at (4.26)
and its numerical value is given at (4.27). The value of the constant b is then
deduced at (4.28).

b = (RΛ/c)2/3C1/3 = 4.534258713925 × 1025.

I shall ﬁnish this discussion with a few remarks about the parametric values
that arise in this theory. Firstly we can calculate the red shift, z, that would
apply to light emitted at the acceleration change time tc from the universe
boundary r(tc) to arrive at a present day observer as

z = r(t†)/r(tc) − 1 ≈ 0.81712.

(4.29)

This certainly strengthens the theory-observation cohesion in that it is a theory
result within the limits suggested by the dark energy workers. An interesting
and curious direct result from this structure is that the ratio of time now to the
time of acceleration change as calculated from their respective values is exactly
2,

One might have noticed the value of this ratio from equations (4.12) and (4.20),

t†/tc = 2.

if one had at some time earlier come across the exact numerical relation (4.36),

coth2(θ(tc)) = 3,
cosh(θ(t†)) = 2,
sinh(θ(t†)) = 31/2,

H(tc) = 31/2c/RΛ
H(t†) = c coth(θ(t†))/RΛ

cosh−1(2) = 2 coth−1(31/2).

H(t) = H(tc) coth(θ(t))/31/2
H(t†) = 2H(tc)/3.

The ﬁrst equation above (4.31) essentially deﬁnes the time tc of change of accel-
eration from negative to positive and comes from equation (4.12). The second
equation above comes from equation (4.17) or (4.19) and deﬁnes the time-now ,
t†, when the input measurements were made. The fourth equation (4.34) comes
from equations (4.18) and (4.31). I have not been able to decide whether or
not the result equation (4.30) is some remarkable coincidence in values of the
present day t† and the past tc or some deep indication of a need to have more
than just the past epoch value tc to be able to talk about a deﬁnite location
in the time history of an event such as a universally distributed change from
deceleration to acceleration. However, equation (4.37) does clearly show up the
background mathematical theory structure of the relation between tc and t at
equation (4.30) in relation to the time evolution of the system and gives equa-
tion (4.38) the Hubble equivalent of (4.30) when t = t† but, I have to admit,
that I have not yet deciphered the physical signiﬁcance of this mathematics as
expressed by (4.30) or (4.38). It would not seem so remarkable if they, (4.30)
and (4.38), were just approximate results but in the construction of this model
they are numerically exact and unexpected.

The formula for the pressure from the Friedman equation (2.4) is, using the

deﬁnitions for H and RΛ at equations (4.6) and (2.18) in (4.41),

P = −(c2(8πGr))(2¨r + ˙r2/r − |Λ|rc2)
= −(c2/(8πG)(2¨r/r + ˙r2/r2 − |Λ|c2)
= (−c2/(8πG))(2¨r/r + H(t)2 − 3(c/RΛ)2).

From equations (3.24), (4.3) and (4.5) we have

2¨r(t)/r(t) = (c/RΛ)2(3 − coth2(θ+(t)))
H(t)2 = (c/RΛ)2 coth2(θ+(t))).

Substuting these formulae into the form for pressure equation (4.41), we ﬁnd
complete cancellation on the right hand side to give an identically equivalent to
zero pressure at all times,

P (t) ≡ 0 ⇒ ω ≡ 0.

(4.44)

Thus this system rigorously describes a dust universe in sharp contradiction to
the dark energy groups measurements for ω at equation (2.13).

A simple interpretation of the force structure that is the cause of the accel-
eration (4.5) that is operative in this model is obtained if we introduce a mass
density ρ† to account for the cosmological constant Λ as

ρ†

Λ = Λc2/(4πG) = 2ρΛ

that is to say its values is twice the value of the usual density function at (2.22).
The Friedman equation (2.4) repeated below at equation (4.46) with P = 0, can
then be expressed as equation (4.47) through to equation (4.52).

0 = 2¨r + ˙r2/r − Λrc2.
¨r = Λrc2/2 − ˙r2/(2r).

Thus associating the density function ρ†

universe with the cosmological constant Λ we get the very transparent formula
for the dynamics under gravity, the acceleration that any particle would experi-
ence at the boundary of the universe being given by equation (4.52). It tells us
clearly that the normal mass density ρ gravitationally causes the usual decel-
erating attraction of this particle to within the universe body whilst the dark
energy mass density causes an acceleration that repels this particle towards the
outside of the universe. The theoretical structure described here involves this
as a naturally occurring eﬀect which is built into this model. Consequently any
need to introduce negative mass densities to describe the dark energy contri-
bution together with the conceptually diﬃcult concept of negative pressure are
removed from contention.

5 Conclusions

It has been shown that a subset of the measurements by the dark energy work-
ers given at equations (2.10), (2.12) and (2.12) together with an input value
for Hubble’s constant now and the assumption that Rindler’s constant, C, is
an absolute constant lead to a unique solution of the Friedman equations. The
fourth measurement from the dark energy observations at equation (2.13) is
not necessary for ﬁnding this solution.
In fact, we have found that this last
measurement is ﬂatly contradicted by the unique solution here obtained from
the ﬁrst three measurements, the unique solution implies that ω ≡ 0. It can
be demonstrated that changing the input value for Hubble’s constant does not
remove this contradiction. Thus we are left with the issue that not demanding
that Rindler’s constant is in fact an absolute constant might make possible the
production of a model from general relativity via Friedman’s equations that is
conformable to all four of the dark energy measurements (2.10), (2.11), (2.12)
and (2.13). However, this is by no means certain and we could be faced with
the strong conclusion that the four dark energy measurements are not compat-
ible with the Friedman equations and indeed consequently not compatible with
general relativity.

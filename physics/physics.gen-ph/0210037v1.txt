Notes on the third law of thermodynamics.I

(February 2, 2008)

We analyze some aspects of the third law of thermodynamics. We ﬁrst review both the entropic
version (N) and the unattainability version (U) and the relation occurring between them. Then, we
heuristically interpret (N) as a continuity boundary condition for thermodynamics at the boundary
T = 0 of the thermodynamic domain. On a rigorous mathematical footing, we discuss the third
law both in Carath´eodory’s approach and in Gibbs’ one. Carath´eodory’s approach is fundamental
in order to understand the nature of the surface T = 0. In fact, in this approach, under suitable
mathematical conditions, T = 0 appears as a leaf of the foliation of the thermodynamic manifold
associated with the non-singular integrable Pfaﬃan form δQrev. Being a leaf, it cannot intersect any
other leaf S = const. of the foliation. We show that (N) is equivalent to the requirement that T = 0
is a leaf. In Gibbs’ approach, the peculiar nature of T = 0 appears to be less evident because the
existence of the entropy is a postulate; nevertheless, it is still possible to conclude that the lowest
value of the entropy has to belong to the boundary of the convex set where the function is deﬁned.

I. INTRODUCTION

We re-analyze the status of the third law of thermodynamics in the framework of a purely thermodynamic formal-
ism. After a discussion of the status of the third law in current physical literature, and after an heuristic justiﬁcation
of the entropic version, we set up a rigorous mathematical apparatus in order to explore the actual necessity for a third
law of thermodynamics. The approach by means of Pfaﬃan forms to thermodynamics, introduced by Carath´eodory,
is the most powerful tool for understanding the problems which can occur in thermodynamic formalism at T = 0. In
our analysis of the latter topic the Pfaﬃan form δQrev is expressed in terms of independent extensive variables. One
ﬁnds that T = 0, as an integral manifold of δQrev, can be a leaf of the thermodynamic foliation if suﬃcient regularity
conditions for the Pfaﬃan form are ensured. Contrarily, T = 0 is intersected by the (would-be) leaves S = const.
which occur at T > 0. The third law appear then as a condition which has to be imposed if a foliation of the whole
thermodynamic manifold, including the adiabatic boundary T = 0, has to be obtained.
Also Gibbs’ approach is analyzed. Carath´eodory’s and Gibbs’ approaches together allow to better deﬁne the problem
of the third law.

The plan of the paper is the following. In sect. II and in sect. III a discussion of the third law and of its standard
proofs is given. A particular attention is devoted to Landsberg’s studies, which are under many respects corner-stones
on this topic. In sect. V we remark that Planck’s restatement of the third law is not conventional but mandatory
for homogeneous systems. In sect. IV, we try to understand, from the physical point of view, if it is possible to
give a purely thermodynamic justiﬁcation for the third principle in the entropic version (N). We show that the third
principle in the entropic version can be in a natural way interpreted as a continuity boundary condition, in the sense
that it corresponds to the natural extension of thermodynamics to the states at T = 0. In sect. VI it is shown that,
in the framework of Carath´eodory approach, (N) is equivalent to ensuring that the surface T = 0 is a leaf of the
thermodynamic foliation associated with the Pfaﬃan form δQrev. The isoentropic surfaces cannot intersect the T = 0
surface, because no common point between distinct leaves of the foliation determined by δQrev is allowed. Some
problems arising when (N) is violated are discussed, and it is recalled that a singular behavior occur if the entropic
version (N) fails. In sect. VII a Gibbsian approach to the problem is sketched. We show that the entropy can reach
its minimum value (if any) only on the boundary T = 0 of its domain.

II. THE THIRD LAW

The third law of thermodynamics has been formulated in two ways. The original formulation of Nernst concerns
the behavior of the entropy of every system as the absolute zero of the temperature is approached. Particularly,
the entropic side of Nernst’s theorem (N) states that, for every system, if one considers the entropy as a function of
the temperature T and of other macroscopic parameters x1, . . . , xn, the entropy diﬀerence ∆T S ≡ S(T, x1, . . . , xn) −
S(T, ¯x1, . . . , ¯xn) goes to zero as T → 0+

for any choice of (x1, . . . , xn) and of (¯x1, . . . , ¯xn). This means that the limit limT →0+ S(T, x1, . . . , xn) is a constant
S0 which does not depend on the macroscopic parameters x1, . . . , xn. Planck’s restatement of (N) is

lim
T →0+

∆S = 0

lim
T →0+

S = 0

(1)

(2)

and it is trivially mandatory for homogeneous systems (cf. sect. V). The other formulation concerns the unattain-
ability (U) of the absolute zero of the temperature. The (U) side can be expressed as the impossibility to reach the
absolute zero of the temperature by means of a ﬁnite number of thermodynamic processes. Both the above formu-
lations are due to Nernst, and they are equivalent under suitable hypotheses, as it has been remarked in Refs. [2–4]
and e.g. also in Refs. [5,6].

The third law has a non deﬁnitively posed status in standard thermodynamics and a statistical mechanical basis
for it is still missing. Counter-Examples to (2) have been constructed [7,8], whereas in Ref. [9] models displaying a
violation of (1) are given. Moreover, the validity of thermodynamics for ﬁnite-size systems if T is suﬃciently near
the absolute zero has been questioned. A corner–stone of this topic is represented by Planck’s objection (see Ref. [10]
and references therein) against a thermodynamic description of a “standard” system below a given temperature, due
to a reduction of the eﬀective degrees of freedom making impossible even to deﬁne an entropy. The same problem is
analyzed in Ref. [11] where the breakdown of thermodynamics near the absolute zero is shown in the case of a Debye
crystal. Thermodynamic formalism is shown to fail because of ﬁnite size eﬀects. Indeed, if the ﬁnite size of a real
thermodynamic system is taken into account, according to Ref. [11] near the absolute zero it is no more possible to
neglect statistical ﬂuctuations in the calculation of thermodynamic quantities like e.g. T, S because they are of the
same order as the “standard” leading terms1. There is a relative uncertainty in the deﬁnition of equilibrium states
which is of order one. Of course, if one considers for the number of degrees of freedom a mathematical limit to inﬁnity,
then the formal success of the thermodynamic approach follows. For more details see Ref. [11]. See also Ref. [12]. We
don’t discuss this topic further on in this paper.
In Refs. [11,13] it is proposed, in agreement also with the general axiomatic approach of Refs. [2,3], that the third
law should be assumed as the position of a boundary condition for the thermodynamic diﬀerential equations, whose
experimental validation is stated in regions above the absolute zero. Moreover, according to statements in Refs. [2,4],
the thermodynamic variables on the “boundary set” of the states at absolute zero temperature could be conven-
tionally deﬁned as suitable limits (not depending on the path used to approach a particular state at T = 0) of the
thermodynamic variables in “inner points” of the thermodynamic conﬁguration space and this is proposed as the only
satisfactory approach to the deﬁnition of thermodynamic variables at the absolute zero [2,3]. To some extent, the
application of the thermodynamic equations to the absolute zero should be considered as a rather formal extrapolation
of the theory in a region beyond its conﬁrmed domain of validity, and this could be considered as the main reason for
introducing a new postulate beyond the zeroth, the ﬁrst and the second law [13]. In sect. IV we come back on this
topic and give an interpretation of Nernst Heat Theorem as a “continuity” boundary condition for thermodynamics
at T = 0.
Concluding this section, it is also remarkable that the third principle, if considered as an impotence principle in
analogy with the ﬁrst and the second principle [14], in the (U) version simply does not allow to get T = 0, whereas
in the (N) version implies also that the work produced by an arbitrarily eﬃcient Carnot machine between T2 > T1
(that is, a thermal machine with eﬃciency arbitrarily near 1−) vanishes as T1 → 0+ (see Ref. [15]). For an extensive
discussion upon the third law see also Refs. [16–18].

1The example of Ref. [11] involves a Debye crystal having a volume V ∼ 1cm3, hN i ∼ 1021; statistical ﬂuctuations are of the
same order as the leading terms for T ∼ 10

−5K.

III. UNATTAINABILITY VS. ENTROPY BEHAVIOR AT T = 0: LANDSBERG’S ANALYSIS AND
STANDARD PROOF

We start by discussing (U) and (N) in standard thermodynamics. The double implication (U)⇔(N), according to

the analysis developed in Refs. [2,4], relies on some hypotheses that it is interesting to recall.

A. (U)⇒(N) in Landsberg’s analysis

A detailed analysis shows that in standard thermodynamics unattainability (U) implies (N) if the following condi-

tions are satisﬁed [2,4]:

a) The stability condition (∂S/∂T )x1,...,xn > 0 is satisﬁed for any transformation such that the external parame-
ters (or deformation coordinates) x1, . . . , xn are kept ﬁxed; these transformations be called isometric transformations
[14].

This hypothesis is in general ensured by the suitable convexity/concavity properties of the thermodynamic potentials
and is given for ensured in Landsberg’s works [2–4]. It is useful to explicit this hypothesis.

b) There are no multiple branches in thermodynamic conﬁguration space.

For the condition b) an equivalent statement is “in thermodynamic space no boundary points diﬀerent from the
T = 0 ones occur” [2], that is, no ﬁrst-order phase transitions are allowed. In our setting, this requirement amounts
to choosing a continuous entropy function.

c) There is no discontinuity in thermodynamic properties of the system near the absolute zero.

In Ref. [2] a careful discussion of the conditions to be satisﬁed in order to ensure (U) is contained.
In particu-
lar, by following Ref. [2], if a),b),c) hold and moreover (N) fails, then T = 0 is attainable. If a),b) and c) hold, then
(U) implies (N). If a),b) hold and (N) fails, then (U) implies that a discontinuity near the absolute zero has to occur,
and such a discontinuity has to prevent the attainability of T = 0 (violation of c)) [2]. Landsberg makes the example
of an abrupt divergence in the elastic constants of a solid as a conceivable ideal process preventing a solid violating
(N) to reach a zero temperature state by means of quasi–static adiabatic volume variations (the hypothesis of Ref. [2]
is compatible with the vanishing near T = 0 of the (adiabatic) compressibilities that are related with elastic constants
in ordinary thermodynamics; particularly, for standard systems one can deﬁne the compressibility modulus as the
inverse of the compressibility; it is proportional to the Young modulus in the case of a solid). Anyway, in standard
thermodynamics a violation of c) is ruled out and is not discussed further on in Ref. [2]. Moreover, in standard
treatment of the third law (U) is associated with the impossibility to get states at T > 0 isoentropic to states at
T = 0, so that c) is not taken into account. A further discussion is found in the following subsections.

Landsberg conjectures that (U) holds if a discontinuity near T = 0 occurs. See also the text. In (a) and (b) the dashed regions
are forbidden.

In Refs. [2,4] a further condition “entropies don’t diverge as T → 0+” takes into account the standard behavior
of thermodynamic systems near the absolute zero. This condition is not necessary if one considers a non-negative
concave entropy (cf. sect. VII). It can be relaxed when inﬁnite values of the parameters are allowed [19]. E.g., in the
non-standard case of black hole thermodynamics, the above condition is not necessary, and in Ref. [20] the divergence
of the entropy occurring in the inﬁnite mass limit for the black hole case is discussed.
Possible failures of the implication (U)⇒(N) are discussed also in Ref. [5], both in the case of reversible processes and
in the case of irreversible ones.

B. (N)⇒(U) in Landsberg’s analysis

The isoentropic character of the zero temperature states is considered a condition ensuring the unattainability (see
e.g. Ref. [13] and Refs. [2,3]). A full implication (N)⇒(U) is possible in the case of thermodynamic processes which
consist of an alternate sequence of quasi-static adiabatic transformations and quasi-static isothermal transformations
(class P(x) according to Refs. [2,3]). Actually, a more general notion of unattainability can be assumed: “zero
temperature states don’t occur in the speciﬁcation of attainable states of systems”. This is almost literally the (U4)
principle as in Refs. [2,3]. (U4) states that no process allows to reach states at T = 0, even as transient non-equilibrium
states. Then (N) can fail and (U) can still be valid: In general, the latter hypothesis allows a de–linking of (U) and
(N) and implies that (N) 6⇒(U) and (U)6⇒(N) [2,3]. But such a de–linking occurs under particular conditions: the
failure of the implication (U)⇒(N) requires again a rejection of one of the hypotheses b),c) above, whereas (N)⇒(U)
fails if processes not belonging to the aforementioned class P(x) allow to reach T = 0 [2,3].

For the sake of completeness, we recall in the following subsection also the standard approach to Nernst’s theorem,

which involves heat capacities [13,18].

C. (U)⇔(N) by means of heat capacities: the standard proof

The implication (U)⇒(N) can be obtained also as follows. It implicitly requires that conditions a),b),c) of Landsberg

hold. Let us consider two states (T1, x1 . . . xn), (T2, y1, . . . , yn) and the related entropies

Cy1,...,yn(T )

(4)

where S(0, x1, . . . , xn), S(0, y1, . . . , yn) are the limits of the above entropies as T → 0+; in the standard proof one
assumes also that (T1, x1 . . . xn), (T2, y1, . . . , yn) lie on the same isoentropic surface and that it is possible to perform
a quasi-static adiabatic process connecting them [13,18]. If T2 = 0, then one gets

S(0, y1, . . . , yn) − S(0, x1, . . . , xn) =

Cx1,...,xn(T )

if S(0, y1, . . . , yn) − S(0, x1, . . . , xn) > 0 and the stability condition Cx1,...,xn (T ) > 0
and this implies that,
holds, a temperature T1 satisfying the last equation always exists, so the unattainability requires S(0, y1, . . . , yn) −
S(0, x1, . . . , xn) ≤ 0. The same reasoning applied to the process (T2, y1, . . . , yn) → (0, x1 . . . xn) gives the opposite
inequality S(0, y1, . . . , yn) − S(0, x1, . . . , xn) ≥ 0 and so one has to conclude that S(0, y1, . . . , yn) = S(0, x1, . . . , xn)
[13,18]. The convergence of the above integrals of course requires a suitable behavior for the heat capacities.
It
is remarkable that, according to this standard proof, (U) is implemented by forbidding the presence on the same
isoentropic surface of states at T = 0 and states at T > 0. Thus isoentropic transformations reaching T = 0 cannot
Indeed, one could also allow for a diﬀerent implementation of (U) in which formally
exist. This is a key point.
states at T > 0 and states at T = 0 lie on the same isoentropic surface but, because of some hindrance arising in
a neighborhood of T = 0, the isoentropic transformation reaching T = 0 actually cannot be performed. This is the
reason for the hypothesis c) of Landsberg.

The converse, that is, the implication (N)⇒(U), is based on the implicit assumption that processes, which don’t
belong to class P(x) and which allow to reach T = 0, don’t exist [2–4]. It is straightforward [18]: Let us consider
an adiabatic reversible process (T1, x1 . . . xn) → (T2, y1, . . . , yn). If (N) holds, then there is no possibility to reach a

4

T = 0 state by means of an adiabatic transformation. That is, if (N) holds, then (N) and the second law imply (U).
Indeed, along an adiabatic transformation

S(T1, x1, . . . , xn) = S(T2, y1, . . . , yn) ⇔

Cx1,...,xn(T ) =

Cy1,...,yn (T )

which is impossible for Cx1,...,xn > 0. The same conclusion holds if an adiabatic transformation from (T1, x1, . . . , xn)
to (0, y1, . . . , yn) is considered. This proof assumes that the only possibility to get T = 0 is by means of a reversible
adiabatic transformation. The latter is a reasonable hypothesis, because any thermal contact and any irreversibility
cannot be successful in obtaining T = 0 due to the second law. For an interesting proof of the above statements see
also Ref. [21].

IV. NAIVE NERNST HEAT THEOREM: A CONTINUITY BOUNDARY CONDITION FOR
THERMODYNAMICS AT T = 0

We assume here a physical attitude, and wonder if it is possible to give a purely thermodynamic justiﬁcation for
the third principle in the entropic version (N). This section is dedicated only to an heuristic discussion. A rigorous
mathematical setting for the third law is found in the following sections.

We stress that, in our reasoning herein, we adopt substantially Landsberg’s point of view as expressed e.g. in Ref.
[4], p. 69: “. . . one must imagine one is approaching the physical situation at T = 0 with an unprejudiced mind,
ready to treat a process at T = 0 like any process at T > 0. With this attitude the maximum information concerning
conditions at T = 0 can be deduced . . .”

Let us assume that transformations along zero temperature states are allowed. In a reversible transformation at

T > 0 it is known that (δQ)rev = T dS.

As a consequence,

∆S = 0 for adiabatic reversible transformations at T > 0.

Then, let us consider ideally which behavior is natural to postulate for thermodynamics at T = 0. Along the
T = 0 isotherm any reversible transformation is adiabatic. From the point of view of thermodynamic formalism, a
discontinuity with respect to the natural identiﬁcation between adiabats and isoentropes arises if the states at T = 0
are not assumed to be isoentropic. From our point of view, the (N) version of Nernst Heat Theorem appears to be as-
sociated with a “continuity boundary condition” for thermodynamics at T = 0. Continuity means that the entropy is
continuous also on the boundary T = 0 and that the identiﬁcation between isoentropic transformations and adiabatic
reversible transformations holds also at T = 0. Indeed, by continuity, it is natural, from the point of view of classical
thermodynamics, to postulate that states at T = 0 are isoentropic and then in the T − S plane the T = 0 line reduces
to a single point (T = 0, S = const). But, in order to match continuously the property that any isothermal reversible
transformation γT =0 at T = 0 is isoentropic, i.e. ∆S = 0 ∀γT =0, one has to require that along the isothermal surfaces
the entropy variation becomes smaller and smaller, that is, ∆ST ≡ S(T, x1, . . . , xn)−S(T, ¯x1, . . . , ¯xn) at ﬁxed external
parameters has to converge to zero as T → 0+.
The underlying hypotheses are:

η0) T = 0 belongs to the equilibrium thermodynamic phase space;
η1) it is possible ideally to conceive transformations at T = 0;
η2) transformations at T = 0 are adiabatic reversible;
η3) transformations at T = 0 are isoentropic;
η4) there is a continuous match between states at T = 0 and states at T > 0.

Actually, η4) could even summarize all the hypotheses above, in the sense that a violation of at least one hypothesis
η0),η1),η2) and η3) would imply a discontinuity in thermodynamics between zero temperature states and non-zero
ones. Concerning η1), we recall that Landsberg substantially rejects it, because he postulates a poor population of

5

zero temperature states in order to forbid the T = 0 transformation in the Carnot-Nernst cycle. Each state can be
associated with its von Neumann entropy and a priori a violation of (N) and a discontinuity are allowed. There is in
any case a postulate about the density of the zero temperature states which is “discontinuous” with respect to the
assumptions for the states at T > 0.

The path of Nernst consists in starting from the violation of the Ostwald’s formulation of the second law which is
implicit in a special Carnot cycle, which has the lower isotherm at T = 0. See the ﬁgure below. We refer to this cycle
as the Carnot-Nernst cycle. If it were possible to perform it, it would imply the existence of a thermal machine with
eﬃciency one, which is a violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Note that the violation of the identiﬁcation
between adiabats and isoentropes is implicit in the T = 0 isotherm of the Carnot-Nernst cycle. In order to avoid this
violation, Nernst postulates therefore the unattainability (U) of the absolute zero (see also Ref. [22]).

A. transformations at T = 0

Criticisms against this path, relating the third law to the second one have a long history (see Refs. [3,10,23,24,15,25]
and references therein) which starts with Einstein’s objection. Einstein underlines that near T = 0 dissipations begin
being non-negligible [23]. This would make the Carnot-Nernst cycle unrealizable because the adiabatic T = 0 could
not be performed. This kind of criticism could be moved also against any attempt to deﬁne transformations at T = 0.
Nevertheless, it is true that a postulate on thermodynamics is required at T = 0, as variously realized in literature
(see e.g. Ref. [10]). The objection against the Carnot-Nernst cycle can also avoid referring to irreversibility arising
near T = 0, as discussed e.g. in Refs. [24,25]. The point is that one reaches the T = 0 surface by means of an adiabatic
reversible transformation, say BC, and that also any transformation CD at T = 0 has to be adiabatic (see the ﬁgure
below).

FIG. 2. Carnot-Nernst cycle in the plane T − S.

Then, it does not seem possible for the system to be carried along the CD transformation contained in the T = 0
surface [24,25] because the adiabatic constraint applies to BC as well as to CD and so an operative procedure (no
matter how ideal) to carry on the cycle seems to be missing. It is to be noted that, by analogy with the operative
deﬁnition of isothermal transformation at T > 0, from a physical point of view, the system should also be considered
to be in thermal contact only with a “source at T = 0”. The non-sense, in the case of T = 0, is evident; a “source
at T = 0” should be deﬁned (a device able to exchange large (arbitrary) amounts of heat without changing its
temperature). The point is that any reversible transformation at T = 0 is adiabatic by itself, thus, from the point of
view of an operative procedure, one should implement an adiabatic insulation of the system.

This kind of reasoning implies a failure of the thermodynamic formalism at T = 0, because of the impossibility to
give a satisfactory prescription for implementing transformations at T = 0. In particular, the problem is related with
the existence of the intersection between adiabatic surfaces (any isoentropic surface intersecting the T = 0 surface
is an adiabatic surface which intersects the very peculiar adiabatic surface T = 0), because of the apparent absence
of tools allowing to pass from one to another one adiabatically. In some sense, we ﬁnd an incompleteness of the
thermodynamic formalism at T = 0, because there are serious problems in deﬁning an operative procedure [23–25].
Nevertheless, we wish to underline that, in line of principle, it could be still possible to implement the adiabatic
transformation at T = 0 as a distinct adiabatic transformation , because, even if an adiabatic constraint is required,

6

it corresponds to a path mathematically distinguished in the thermodynamic space. It is clear that, if one considers
a system described by (U, V, N ) and, in ideally approaching T = 0 considers the system as closed, then no possibility
to distinguish operatively between the adiabatic transformation implemented in order to approaching T = 0 and the
adiabatic transformation T = 0 is left. But for systems with a larger thermodynamic space (e.g. systems characterized
by other deformation parameters) one could have closed systems where the adiabatic and isothermal transformation
at T = 0 could be implemented.

A ﬁnal comment.

It is often stated that the third principle is not as fundamental as the ﬁrst and the second
ones and that it is not related to any new potential in thermodynamics, whereas the ﬁrst law is associated with the
internal energy function and the second law with the entropy [5]. On this side of the topic, the third law prescribes
the behavior of the zero-temperature part of the entropy limT →0+ S(T, x1, . . . , xn) = S(0, x1, . . . , xn) ≡ Σ(x1, . . . , xn)
and ﬁxes its value to zero. We shall show that

The third law of thermodynamics (Planck restatement) corresponds to a regularity condition of the Pfaﬃan equation
δQrev = 0 on the boundary T = 0 of the thermodynamic manifold.
It is equivalent to the request that a well-deﬁned
foliation of the whole thermodynamic manifold exists.

In the following sections, we discuss the problem in a mathematically rigorous framework.

V. ABSOLUTE ENTROPY AND PLANCK’S POSTULATE

In our discussion of the third law, the zero-temperature entropy constant is undetermined, with the only constraint
S0 ≥ 0 suggested by statistical mechanical considerations. Planck’s restatement of (N) requires S0 = 0, that is,
S → 0+ as T → 0+, because the constant S0 (entropy at T = 0), which does not depend on the thermodynamic
parameters, does not aﬀect any physical measurement [26]. According to some authoritative experts in the ﬁeld
of thermodynamics, this corresponds to a suﬃcient condition for implementing (N), not a necessary one [17,15,27].
Problems arising with chemical reactions can be suitably solved [17,15,27]. An analogous position against the neces-
sity of Planck’s restatement appears also in statistical mechanics. E.g.
in Ref. [28] statements, according to which
systems violating S → 0+ as T → 0+ in the thermodynamic limit, automatically violate (N), have been criticized.
Residual entropies coming from theoretical calculations in statistical mechanics, as far as they are not involved with
a dependence of the ground state entropy on macroscopic parameters, they still cannot be considered as violations
of the third law [28]. Also in Ref. [29] the violation of Planck’s statement is not considered a priori as implying a
violation of (N). We ﬁrst discuss the problem in the framework of the thermodynamics of homogeneous systems; then
we add some comments about the relation with statistical mechanics.

Notice that a necessary condition for (N) to hold is that S is continuous in the limit T = 0, whichever state is
considered on the surface T = 0. In fact, let us deﬁne X ≡ x1, . . . , xn and let us assume that S is not continuous
in (0, X0). If this discontinuity is not simply an eliminable one, there exist two diﬀerent sequences {T (i)
n }, with
i = 1, 2, such that (T (i)
n ) → (0, X0) as n → ∞ and, moreover, such that

(N) is badly violated. See also sect. VII. The violation of (N) occurs also in the case of a (unnatural) eliminable
discontinuity. As a consequence, the continuity of S on the surface T = 0 is assumed.

It is to be noted that, if (N) holds, the entropy constant at T = 0 cannot depend on the composition variables
ni which specify the number of moles of the component substances which are present in the material whose thermo-
dynamic properties are studied. Herein, we let composition variables ni to be included in the set of what we called
deformation parameters 2. Then, under suitable hypotheses it holds

2This choice can be opinable in light of a rigorous axiomatic approach [30], but it allows us to call deformation parameters
all the parameters diﬀerent from U (from T ) in our discussion, which is limited to some aspects of the third law.

(Note that ¯Si is not the entropy of the single component; such an identiﬁcation would originate a wrong expression
for the entropy, as it is clear for the case of mixtures of ideal gases, where an entropy of mixing appears).
As a consequence, it appears that the arbitrary constant S0 is zero both for pure phases and for mixtures and chemical
reactions. In the latter case, the third law states that

where νi are the stoichiometric coeﬃcients. Actually, each derivative should vanish at the absolute zero. The
alternative deﬁnition of Ref. [27,15] seems to be not satisfactory from the point of view of (N), because the zero-
temperature entropy appears to depend on composition variables (which would allow for the composite a diﬀerent
zero-temperature entropy for diﬀerent molar fractions of the components, against the postulate of Nernst).
Then it is thermodynamically appropriate to put S0 = 0. This actually not only does not amount to a real loss of
generality, because measurements leave the constant undetermined 3; it is also a necessity (if the third law holds) for
homogeneous systems, because S0 is required to satisfy the homogeneity property of the entropy of a homogeneous
system. S is an homogeneous function of degree one in the extensive variables, say, (U, V, N ). Because of the Euler
theorem, this implies that, by introducing the operator

with respect to U [which is allowed by the fact that ∂T /∂U > 0] one ﬁnds U = h(T, V, N ) which is an homogeneous
function of degree one in the extensive variables (V, N ). Then one obtains S(T, V, N ) which is homogeneous of degree
one in the extensive variables (V, N ) [it is a quasi-homogeneous function of degree one and weights (0, 1, 1)]. If (N) is
satisﬁed, then

for any choice of V, N . Because of the homogeneity, for any λ > 0 one has

S(T, V, N ) = S0

3In order to understand this point, it is important to underline that the constant S0 has actually no operative meaning, in
the sense that thermodynamic measurements (and extrapolations for the limit T → 0+) are relative to the integral of C/T .
So, in line of principle, it can be put equal to 0 without aﬀecting thermodynamic measurements.

which is consistent with the independence of the limit from V, N only for S0 = 0. No additive constant can appear as
T → 0+, because of the homogeneity, thus Planck’s restatement of the third law is mandatory if (N) is satisﬁed.

Summarizing:

Planck’s restatement is mandatory if (N) holds, due to the homogeneity property of S.

A short comment about the third law in statistical mechanics is in order. It is commonly stated that a violation
of (N) occurs if the ground state is degenerate. Moreover, As far as the limit as T → 0+ is concerned, one has to
distinguish between ﬁnite size systems and bulk systems.
In the latter case, Griﬃths shows that, in determining
the behavior of thermodynamic systems near the absolute zero, in measurements, what is really important is the
contribution of the excitable low-energy quantum states: for bulk systems the contribution of the ground state, at
reachable low temperatures, is irrelevant in determining the behavior of the system, which is instead dominated by
the contributions of the low-lying energy states [7] (the degeneracy of the ground state is not a good indicator of the
behavior of the entropy for bulk systems at low temperature because the thermodynamic limit has to be carried out
before the limit as T → 0+ and the two limits in general don’t commute [7]). In statistical mechanics, the ground state
degeneracy for bulk systems does not play a straightforward role in determining the behavior as the absolute zero is
approached, and examples exist where the ground state is not degenerate but the limit S → 0+ is not implemented [7].
However, a role for the degeneracy of the ground state can be suitably resorted as in Ref. [8]. Therein, it is remarked
that the entropy functional at T = 0 depends on the boundary conditions. Diﬀerent boundary conditions correspond
to diﬀerent ground states for the bulk system, and the contribution of the excitations of the low-lying states near the
absolute zero can be related with a maximally degenerate ground state by means of a variational criterion [8].
We limit ourselves to refer the reader to Ref. [31] for a further approach to the problem of the third law by means of
the concept of dynamical entropy and to Ref. [32] for another interesting point of view concerning the problem of the
third law in presence of ground state degeneracy.

VI. CARATH´EODORY’S APPROACH AND (N)

In Carath´eodory’s approach [33], the inﬁnitesimal heat exchanged reversibly δQrev, deﬁned on a open simply
connected domain D, is a Pfaﬃan form, i.e. a one-form ω, whose integrability has to be ensured in order to deﬁne an
entropy function. See e.g. Refs. [14,34–37]. This approach appears to be very clarifying with respect to the problem
represented by the special surface T = 0. In the following, we use ω ≡ δQrev.

A. Foliation in thermodynamics

Carath´eodory’s principle of adiabatic inaccessibility is usually stated for the case where D has no boundary, that

is, ∂D = ∅ [36,37]. It can be formulated as follows:

(C): each neighborhood of any state x0 belonging to the domain D contains states which are inaccessible from
x0 along solutions of ω = 0.

This principles ensures that the Pfaﬃan form ω is completely integrable, i.e.
way that a foliation of the thermodynamic manifold into isoentropic hypersurfaces is allowed.
If a boundary is present, there are some changes in the theory4. The integrability condition

it satisﬁes ω ∧ dω = 0, in such a

has to be imposed in the interior of the domain of the diﬀerential form ω, where ω is required to be at least C1. These
properties ensure that Frobenius theorem can be applied and one obtains a foliation in the inner part of the manifold.

ω ∧ dω = 0

(17)

with boundary.

For what concerns the boundary, it can be in part transverse and in part tangent to the inner foliation. It is tangent
when it is a leaf of the foliation itself, i.e. if the boundary is an integral manifold for ω [38]. If, instead, it is not a
leaf, one can induce on the boundary a foliation from the inner foliation. Then, a foliation of the whole manifold is
obtained if suﬃcient regularity conditions for ω on the boundary are assumed.
Let us now consider what happens in thermodynamics. The integrating factor T vanishes at T = 0, which means what
follows. The non-singular integrable Pfaﬃan form δQrev gives rise to a foliation of the thermodynamic manifold for
T > 0. Each leaf of the foliation is a solution of the equation δQrev = 0. This foliation has codimension one (i.e., each
leaf is an hypersurface in the thermodynamic manifold). For T > 0, the leaves of the foliation are the hypersurfaces
S = const. One has then to determine if the surface T = 0 is a leaf itself. It is indeed an integral submanifold of
the Pfaﬃan form ω, in the sense that any curve contained in the surface T = 0. For any initial point lying on the
submanifold T = 0, there is a curve γ lying entirely in the submanifold T = 0. One has to ensure the uniqueness of
the solutions of the Cauchy problem for the ordinary diﬀerential equations associated with ω. The Lipschitz condition
for each of them would be enough in order to get an unique solution. If ω is C1 also on the boundary T = 0, then
we can show that the uniqueness is ensured and T = 0 is a leaf of the thermodynamic foliation (a tangent leaf). The
special leaf T = 0 cannot intersect any other leaf S = const. deﬁned at T > 0, because no intersection of leaves is
allowed. In the following subsections, we analyze the above problem in detail.

B. domain D

Let D be the thermodynamic manifold whose independent coordinates are the extensive variables U, V, X 1, . . . , X n;
the variables V, X 1, . . . , X n will also be called deformation parameters. Assume that dimD = n+2. D is assumed to be
a open convex set, in order to match the concavity property of S. Homogeneity requires that (λ U, λ V, λ X 1, . . . , λ X n)
belongs to D for each real positive λ, thus D has to be also closed with respect to multiplication by a positive real
scalar, i.e., D has to be a cone. Then, it is natural to require that D is a convex cone [39]. One can also relax to some
extent the latter condition [e.g., a positive lower bound on V, N should be introduced on a physical ground, they cannot
be arbitrarily near the zero value or statistical ﬂuctuations would not allow to deﬁne a meaningful thermodynamic
state. Cf. [39]].

C. Pfaﬃan forms and homogeneous systems

Let ω ≡ δQrev be the Pfaﬃan form of interest, which is identiﬁed with the inﬁnitesimal heat exchanged reversibly.

It is assumed to be at least of class C1 in the inner part of the thermodynamic manifold. One can write

where (U, V, X 1, . . . , X n) are extensive variables. The integrability of δQrev ensures that

We assume that δQrev is an homogeneous Pfaﬃan form of degree one. This means that the vector ﬁeld

f ≡ iY δQrev = δQrev(Y ) = U + p V −

ξi X i.

Xi

The integrating factor is required to be such that f 6≡ 0, which means that Y is not a characteristic or trivial symmetry
for the distribution associated with δQrev. Cf. Ref. [41]. Moreover, one requires f ≥ 0, which is easily shown to be
equivalent to the conventional choice T ≥ 0. We sketch here some results of Ref. [39]. One ﬁnds

and it can be shown in general that, for any homogeneous integrable Pfaﬃan form, ω/f has to be equal to dH/H,
where H is a positive deﬁnite homogeneous function of degree one; moreover, the homogeneous function H is unique
apart from a multiplicative undetermined constant [39]. This function H is actually the entropy S, as it can be
straightforwardly deduced also by direct comparison with the deﬁnition of S as extensive function

where Γ indicates a path between a reference state U0, V0, X 1
the thermodynamic foliation is described everywhere in D by the leaves ˆS = const., which means that ˆS has to be
deﬁned everywhere on the thermodynamic manifold (except maybe on the boundary f = 0) [39]. The only problems
can occur where f = 0. Moreover, one also assumes that to each level set S = const. correspond a unique leaf (which
means that each isoentropic surface is path-connected, as it is natural to assume).

D. zeroes of the integrating factor and the domain

Let us deﬁne the set

Z(f ) ≡ {(U, V, X 1, . . . , X n) | f (U, V, X 1, . . . , X n) = 0}.

Z(f ) is the set of the zeroes of f . We deﬁne also

Z(T ) ≡ {(U, V, X 1, . . . , X n) | T (U, V, X 1, . . . , X n) = 0},

and

Z(S) ≡ {(U, V, X 1, . . . , X n) | S(U, V, X 1, . . . , X n) = 0}.

The set Z(f ) = Z(T ) ∪ Z(S) corresponds to an integral manifold of ω (ω is non-singular and ω = f d ˆS).

The set Z(T ) is expected to be an hypersurface, but, in general, it could be a priori a submanifold of dimension
1 ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Actually, it is natural to assume that it is a hypersurface, i.e., a manifold of codimension one. The
equation

T (U, V, X 1, . . . , X n) = 0

is required to be implemented for any value of V, X 1, . . . , X n which is compatible with the system at hand. Contrarily,
one should admit that T = 0 could be allowed only for a restricted region of parameters (e.g., a crystal could not
be allowed to assume a value V = V0 for the volume at T = 0) in such a way that a thermal contact with a lower
temperature system could not lower the system temperature near the absolute zero if values of the parameters outside
the allowable range would be involved. We then assume that the T = 0 is a path-connected hypersurface which
coincides with the adiabatic boundary T = 0 of the thermodynamic manifold. See also subsect. VI F .

The set Z(S) has to be contained in the boundary of the thermodynamic manifold. This is a consequence of the
concavity of S and of the requirement S ≥ 0, as it is shown in sect. VII. S = 0 can be moreover attained only on
the boundary surface T = 0, in fact S = 0 at T > 0 can be rejected on physical grounds. In fact, any state z such
that Tz > 0 and S(z) = 0 should have the peculiar property to allow the system only to absorb heat along any path
γz starting from z in a neighborhood Wz of z. If Cγ(T ) is the heat capacity along a path γ which does not contain
isothermal sub-paths, one has that

2. Z(S)

S(y) =

should be positive for any state y non isoentropic to z in Wz, which is possible only for heat absorption (in fact,
Cγz (T ) < 0 would be allowed for states such that Tz < Ty, which would imply heat absorption, and Cγz (T ) > 0 would
be allowed for states such that Tz > Ty). The same is true if one considers an isothermal path starting at z, in fact
the heat exchanged would be Tz∆S and ∆S should be positive in a neighborhood of z, being S = 0 a global minimum
of S. Thermal contact with a colder body at T < Tz should allow an heat ﬂow outgoing from the system because of
the second law in Clausius formulation. Then, no possibility to approximate such a thermal contact by means of a
reversible transformation exists, and this behavior can be refused as pathological.
There is also another argument one can introduce against the possibility that, for a non-negative deﬁnite entropy, the
set Z(S) − Z(T ) is non-empty. By using standard formulas of thermodynamics, one has

S(T, x1, . . . , xn+1) = S(0, x1, . . . , xn+1) +

Cx1,...,xn+1(z) > 0 ∀ T ;

(32)

T

(x1, . . . , xn+1) are deformation parameters (they could be also in part intensive); because of the concavity condition
Cx1,...,xn+1(T ) > 0 the entropy can vanish only for T = 0. A further discussion is found in subsection VI F.

Then a non-negative concave entropy implies that the set Z(S) of the zeroes of S is contained in the set Z(T ) of

the zeroes of T :

The two sets coincide if (N) holds, otherwise Z(S) ⊂ Z(T ) and it could be that Z(S) = ∅. Then we get the following
equality:

If one considers a concave entropy which can be also negative, then it happens that Z(f ) ⊇ Z(T ) because Z(S) is
not, in general, a subset of Z(T ). A typical example is the classical ideal gas. Let us consider the monoatomic ideal
gas. One has [48]

Then Z(f ) ⊃ Z(T ) and f vanishes before U = 0 is reached.

The equation f = 0 is an implicit equation which deﬁnes a submanifold of the thermodynamic manifold. This is
trivial if f is at least C1 everywhere in D ∪ ∂D, in fact f = 0 deﬁnes a C1 hypersurface contained in the domain. This
submanifold could be trivially an hyperplane U = U0 = const., or a non-trivial hypersurface U = b(U, V, X 1, . . . , X n).
A further discussion is found in subsect. VI F and in subsect. VII C.

E. T = 0 in thermodynamics

The surface T = 0 is usually excluded as unphysical. In Refs. [30,42,43] an axiomatic approach to thermodynamics
excludes a priori that the value T = 0 belongs to the thermodynamic manifold. In literature often the claim appears
that the temperature, for consistency, has to be strictly positive (see e.g. Refs. [42,43]). From the point of view of
the approach involving extensive variables, it has to be discussed if Z(T ) is empty or not (it is surely non-empty in
the black hole case, see also Ref. [44]). In the former case, it should be discussed if there is a lowest temperature
[2] (maybe diﬀerent for each system) and what this implies for the physics. A diﬀerent lowest temperature for each
system is not a viable hypothesis, because one could put in thermal contact a system at its own lowest temperature
with another system at a lower temperature and should see an heat ﬂux from the former to the latter, and a decrease
of the temperature of the former. Thus, a lowest temperature should be allowed to be the same for all systems.
Moreover, from an experimental point of view there is no apparent limit to the possibility to approach T = 0. From
a theoretical point of view, there is actually no physical hindrance to consider T = 0 as a possible value. From a
mathematical point of view, the Pfaﬃan form (δQrev) vanishes at T = 0 but it is non-singular. A singularity of a
i ai(x) dxi is deﬁned as the set where ai(x) = 0 ∀ i, i.e., where all the coeﬃcients of the Pfaﬃan
Pfaﬃan form ω ≡
form vanish. But in the thermodynamic case, no singularity is allowed, because of the coeﬃcient of the internal energy
term, which is in any case one. Thus, no mathematical hindrance to consider T = 0 in the thermodynamic domain
appears. The singularity appears only when T is used as independent variable, and it is due to the fact that the
change of variable U 7→ T is a diﬀeomorphism only for T > 0. See also the following subsection. This topic is also
discussed in Ref. [19].

P

In thermodynamics, as discussed in sect. VI D, it is to some extent natural to assume that the boundary T = 0 is

described explicitly by a (maybe smooth, let us assume at least C1) function:

F. boundary revisited

U = b(X 1, . . . , X n+1);

one can ﬁgure that it corresponds to the equation for the ground-state energy of the system as a function of the
deformation parameters, as it is clear from the following analysis. b is a function which is homogeneous of degree one
with respect to (X 1, . . . , X n+1):

Thus, b has to be deﬁned on a cone Kb ⊂ IRn+1. Moreover, if U0, X 1, . . . , X n+1 belongs to the boundary T = 0, from

b(λ X 1, . . . , λ X n+1) = λ b(X 1, . . . , X n+1).

where the integral is an improper integral, because ∂T /∂U = 1/CX 1,...,X n+1 → ∞ as T → 0+, and from the concavity
it has to hold U ≥ b(X 1, . . . , X n+1). Thus,
of S, which implies that CX 1,...,X n+1 > 0, one ﬁnds that U ≥ U0, i.e.
the domain D has to be such that the inequality U ≥ b(X 1, . . . , X n+1) is implemented for each U and for each
(X 1, . . . , X n+1) ∈ Kb. The domain D contains the set

(44)

This set is the so-called epigraph of the function b. If the function b(V, X 1, . . . , X n) is required to be convex, then
it is deﬁned on the convex cone Kb, and its epigraph epi(b) is a convex cone (the epigraph of an homogeneous b is a
cone). Then, the domain D can be chosen to be

One can also assume that D is a convex cone of the form

D = epi(b).

D = {(U, V, X 1, . . . , X n) | (V, X 1, . . . , X n+1) ∈ IV × IX 1 × . . . IX n , U ≥ b(V, X 1, . . . , X n)},

where the intervals IV , IX 1, . . . , IX n are IR+. We can ﬁnd a coordinatization of the boundary by means of coordinates
(B, X 1, . . . , X n+1) such that the boundary T = 0 coincides with B = 0. In fact, we can simply deﬁne

B ≥ 0 is a degree one homogeneous function, and ∂U/∂B = 1. By inverting one ﬁnds

B ≡ U − b(X 1, . . . , X n+1);

U = B + b(X 1, . . . , X n+1).

As a consequence, one gets

by deﬁnition, ¯f vanishes for B = 0, i.e.

Z(S) ⊆ Z(T ) necessarily. In fact, one can write for an everywhere continuous entropy

One could also allow for diﬀerent choices of coordinates. Instead of B deﬁned as above, one could introduce another

Notice that, because of the properties of the Pfaﬃan form ω, the absolute temperature T cannot be used as a good
coordinate for the boundary, in fact ∂U/∂T → 0 as T → 0+ for all physical systems allowing a ﬁnite S at T = 0. This
choice (as well as the choice of f ) seems to transform the regular Pfaﬃan form ω into a singular one, but this trouble
is simply due to the singularity in the jacobian of the coordinate transformation U 7→ T , which is a diﬀeomorphism

In order to understand better the problem of the boundary T = 0, it is useful to recall the equivalence between the
equation ω = 0 and the so-called Mayer-Lie system of partial diﬀerential equations [herein, X i stays for any extensive
variable diﬀerent from U and ξi for the corresponding intensive variable]

∂U
∂X i (X 1, . . . , X n+1) = ξi(U, X 1, . . . , X n+1)

for i = 1, . . . , n + 1.

One can also assign an initial condition

U (X 1

0 , . . . , X n+1

0

) = U0

and thus deﬁne a Cauchy problem for the above Mayer-Lie system. The integrability condition ω ∧ dω = 0 in the
inner part of the manifold is suﬃcient for a C1 Pfaﬃan form in order to ensure the existence and the uniqueness of
the above Cauchy problem. This means that the Cauchy problem with initial point on the T = 0 boundary allows
solutions which lie in T = 0. If ω is C1 also on the boundary, then it is evident that the aforementioned curves are the
only possible solutions to the above Cauchy problem with initial point on the surface T = 0. In other terms, if ω ∈ C1
everywhere, then T = 0 is a leaf of the thermodynamic foliation. But, a priori, one can consider also a Pfaﬃan form
ω such that it is continuous on the boundary T = 0 but non-necessarily C1 there. The uniqueness of the solution

of (64) with initial condition on the surface T = 0 could be ensured if the functions ξi(U, X 1, . . . , X n+1) are locally
Lipschitzian with respect to U uniformly with respect to X 1, . . . , X n+1 in a neighborhood of (U0, X 1
). If
even this condition fails, then the continuity of ω, i.e., the continuity of ξ also in T = 0 can allow multiple solutions
of the diﬀerential equation (64).

Let us consider the following diﬀerential equation which describes isoentropic curves in the special coordinated

˜ξi(B(τ ), X 1(τ ), . . . , X n+1(τ ))

(66)

This equation can be easily obtained from (64). Let us consider at least piecewise C1 functions X 1(τ ), . . . , X n+1(τ )
for τ ∈ [0, 1]. These functions are arbitrarily assigned. Let us consider a solution curve such that limτ →τ0 B(τ ) = 0
for τ0 ∈ [0, 1]. By hypothesis, X 1(τ ), . . . , X n+1(τ ) are ﬁnite for τ → τ0. Then, by continuity, such a solution can be
extended to τ = τ0, i.e. T = 0 cannot be a leaf. This happens as a consequence of well-known theorems on the ordinary
0 , . . . , X n+1(0) = X n+1
diﬀerential equations, see [45], pp. 67-68. Let us then consider a point (B(0) = 0, X 1(0) = X 1
)
on the surface T = 0. In each neighborhood of this point, one can ﬁnd inner points, each of which belongs to a surface
S = const. In fact, each point of the surface B = 0 is a limit point for the nearby inner points of the thermodynamic
domain and each inner point has to belong to a S = const. integral manifold, because of the integrability condition.
If T = 0 is a leaf [or if the connected components of T −1(0) are leaves if T = 0 is not connected], the only possibility
is that, in approaching T = 0, one is forced to change leaf S = const., i.e., it is not possible to approach T = 0 by
remaining on the same leaf S = const., otherwise the inner solution of ω = 0 could be extended to T = 0. Notice
that, in case there exist two solutions of the Cauchy problem for the diﬀerential equation (66) with initial condition
(B(0) = 0, X 1(0) = X 1
), one lying in the T = 0 surface and the other leaving the T = 0
surface, then these solutions are tangent at the initial point. This means that, in case of existence of the limit as
B → 0+ of the entropy, when (N) is violated, there are surfaces S = const. which are tangent to the submanifold
T = 0. We now prove these statements.

1. validity of (N)

If (N) holds, then T = 0 plays at most the role of asymptotic manifold for the inner leaves S = const. No inner
integral manifold can intersect T = 0, i.e., T = 0 is a leaf.
In order to approach T = 0 at ﬁnite deformation
parameters, one has necessarily to change from one adiabatic surface S = const. to another one, it is impossible to
approach T = 0 by means of a single adiabatic transformation. We have then a mathematical explanation of the naive
unattainability picture sketched by means of S − T diagrams one ﬁnds in standard textbooks on thermodynamics (cf.
also the deﬁnition of P (x) transformations in [2]).

2. violation of (N)

X ≡ X 1, . . . , X n+1.

If, instead, (N) is violated and limB→0+ S(B, X 1

0 < S(0, X 1
This can be proved by means of a variant of the implicit function theorem. For simplicity, we put here

), then the inner integral manifold

Let us consider a point (0, X0) which is not a local minimum for S, i.e.
it is not such that S(0, X0) ≤ S(B, X) in
a neighborhood of (0, X0). Such a point surely exists if (N) is violated, as it is easy to show (cf. also [19]). We are
interested in the zeroes of the function

σ(B, X) ≡ S(B, X) − S(0, X0).

The function σ(B, X) is a continuous function which is monotonically strictly increasing in B everywhere in the
domain D ∪ ∂D, because S(B, X) is, by construction, a strictly increasing monotone function in B, as it is evident
from (54).
In particular, we wish to know if there is a continuous function B(X) deﬁned in a neighborhood of (0, X0) such that
σ(B(X), X) = 0 and such that B(X0) = 0. If (0, X0) is a strict local minimum for S, then by deﬁnition there exists a
neighborhood of (0, X0) where σ(B, X) > 0, thus the aforementioned function B(X) does not exists. If it is a weak local

(67)

(68)

minimum, in the sense that S(0, X0) ≤ S(B, X) in a neighborhood and the equality is allowed, again σ(B(X), X) = 0
does not admit solutions, in fact if S(B, X) = S(0, X0) is allowed in a neighborhood W ⊃ [0, B0) × V of (0, X0), with
V ∋ X0 open set, then S(0, X) < S(0, X0) because S(0, X) < S(B, X). Thus, being (0, X0) a local minimum, one
can ﬁnd a smaller neighborhood where S(B, X) = S(0, X0) is impossible for any B > 0 (S(0, X) = S(0, X0) is instead
allowed).
Notice that (0, X0) cannot be a local but non global minimum for S under the natural requirement that each surface
S = const. corresponds to a unique integral manifold of δQrev [this means that isoentropic states are path-connected.
Cf. [39]]. In fact, in homogeneous thermodynamics, there exists an integral manifold of δQrev such that S(B, X) =
S(0, X0) = const.
if (0, X0) is not a global minimum, and to such an integral manifold (0, X0) would not belong if
(0, X0) is a local minimum. Notice also that no point belonging to the boundary B = 0 can be a local maximum,
because S(B, X) is a strictly increasing monotone function in B.

In any convex neighborhood W of (0, X0) there exist (B+, X +) and (B−, X −) such that σ(B+, X +) > 0
and σ(B−, X −) < 0, because (0, X0) is not a local minimum. By continuity, for any convex neighborhood of
(0, X0) there exists (B0, X 0) such that σ(B0, X 0) = 0. The point (0, X0) is then a limit point for the set
Z(σ) ≡ {(B0, X 0)|σ(B0, X 0) = 0}, which is a closed set because σ is continuous.
In order to show that a solu-
tion B(X) for σ(B(X), X) = 0 exists and is unique, we introduce the following auxiliary function

¯σ(B, X) ≡

σ(B, X)
for B ≥ 0;
S(0, X) − S(0, X0) + B for B < 0.

(cid:20)

This function ¯σ(B, X) is a continuous function which is monotone strictly increasing in B also for B < 0. We have
extended then σ to negative values of B, which is shown to be an useful trick. We cannot use the standard form of
the implicit function theorem because ∂S/∂B diverges at B = 0. Nevertheless, the proof is a variant of the standard
proof of the implicit function theorem for scalar functions. We have that ¯σ(0, X0) = 0. By the monotonicity property
one has that there exist B1 < 0 < B2 such that ¯σ(B1, X0) < 0 < ¯σ(B2, X0). By continuity, there exists an open
neighborhood R ∋ X0 such that ¯σ(B1, X) < 0 < ¯σ(B2, X) for all X ∈ R. Then, from the intermediate value theorem
it follows that there exists a value ¯B ∈ (B1, B2) such that ¯σ( ¯B, X) = 0 for any ﬁxed X ∈ R. Monotonicity ensures
that ¯B is unique for each ﬁxed X ∈ R. The function B(X) : R → IR is then deﬁned as the map deﬁned by B(X) = ¯B,
where ¯B is the solution of ¯σ( ¯B, X) = 0 for each ﬁxed X ∈ R. Such a function satisﬁes B(X0) = 0 and is also
continuous in X. This follows again from the fact that ¯σ is a continuous function which is monotonically strictly
increasing in B. Being continuous, one has that the set

Z(¯σ) ≡ {(B, X)|¯σ(B, X) = 0}

is a closed set. Given a sequence {Xn} ⊂ R such that Xn → ˆX ∈ R for n → ∞, one ﬁnds that there exists a
unique (by monotonicity) ˆB such that ( ˆB, ˆX) ∈ Z(¯σ). This means that limn→∞ B(Xn) = B( ˆX) = ˆB, i.e., B(X) is
continuous.
It is evident that

Z(¯σ) ⊇ Z(σ)

and we have to get rid of the spurious solution B = −(S(0, X) − S(0, X0)) < 0 which could occur for S(0, X) −
S(0, X0) > 0. But this solution cannot hold for any X ∈ R, because in any neighborhood of (0, X0) there exist points
(0, X −) such that S(0, X −) − S(0, X0) < 0. Thus, being the spurious solution not deﬁned in the whole R, the above
theorem allows to conclude that B(X) ≥ 0 surely exists.
Notice that, for inner points B(X) > 0, this solution is actually a leaf of the foliation deﬁned by the integrable at
least C1 Pfaﬃan form ω. As a consequence, for inner points B(X) is at least C2. One can also calculate the gradient
of B(X 1, . . . , X n+1):

where the latter equality is due to the fact that B(X) satisﬁes the Mayer-Lie system. It is then evident that

i.e. B(X) reaching B = 0 is tangent to B = 0.

The above condition about the absence of inner integral manifolds arbitrarily approaching T = 0 is also suﬃcient.
Notice also that it does not forbid the inner leaves to asymptotically approach T = 0 as some deformation variable,
|X k| → ∞ as B → 0+. The unattainability is clearly ensured because of such a
say X k, is allowed to diverge:
divergence. Let us consider the following equation:

which is another rewriting of the above equation where B plays the role of independent variable and where n functions
X i, say X 1(B), . . . , X n(B), are arbitrarily assigned. For simplicity, let us put X n+1(B) ≡ X(B). One could also

T = 0 has to be a leaf. Some examples are given below.

It is evident that the only solution of this problem is U = 0, which is a leaf of the thermodynamic foliation. By
integrating, one ﬁnds the (concave) entropy S = c0 U 3/5V 2/5 and T = 5/(3c0) (U/V )2/5 [c0 is an undetermined
constant]. (N) is satisﬁed. Along an isoentropic surface S0 > 0, one ﬁnds

H. conditions for the validity of (N)

in Gibbsian variables, if the homogeneous Pfaﬃan form is (at least) C1 also on the boundary Z(f ) and if the entropy
S is concave, then (N) holds.
(suﬃcient but not necessary condition)

Recall that S ≥ 0 by construction and also on statistical mechanical grounds. Let us assume that the Pfaﬃan
form δQrev is C1 everywhere, also on the boundary, and that it satisﬁes the integrability condition in the inner part
of the manifold. Then, the integrating factor f is a C1 function everywhere.
In variables U, V, N one has

S cannot be non-negative and concave near T = 0 if it diverges as T → 0+ [2]. See also sect. VII. Then concavity
and positivity also near T = 0 force the entropy to be ﬁnite in the limit T → 0+. Moreover, one has ∂T /∂U =
1/CX 1,...,X n+1, where CX 1,...,X n+1 is the standard heat capacity at constant deformation parameters, which has to
vanish in the limit as T → 0+ because S has to be ﬁnite in that limit. As a consequence, ∂T /∂U = 1/CX 1,...,X n+1 → ∞
as T → 0+. Then, by inspection of (99), it is evident that f is C1 also on the boundary only for S → 0+ as T → 0+.
As a consequence of this theorem, we can conclude that any violation of (N) is involved with a Pfaﬃan form that is
not C1 also on the boundary, as it can be easily veriﬁed by considering the examples violating (N) in section VII.

1. geometrical aspects of f = 0

If δQrev is at least of class C1 everywhere, then d(δQrev) is continuous and ﬁnite on the surface f = 0 (that is,
T = 0). From a geometrical point of view, the surface f = 0 is a so-called separatrix according to the deﬁnition of Ref.
[40], in the sense that the 2−form (δQrev) ∧ df vanishes with f on this surface. One has (δQrev) ∧ df = −f d(δQrev),
as it can be easily veriﬁed by using (21) and standard Cartan identities. f = 0 is also a surface where the symmetry
associated with the vector ﬁeld Y becomes trivial [41], in the sense that it becomes tangent to the submanifold f = 0.
In the case where the complete integrability of δQrev is preserved also on the surface f = 0, one has that f = 0
appears as a special leaf of the thermodynamic foliation, it is indeed the only leaf which is left invariant by the action
of Y .
In general, for a suﬃciently regular ω at f = 0, the property for f = 0 to be a separatrix in the sense of Ref. [40]
ensures that the solutions of δQrev = 0 in the inner part of the thermodynamic manifold cannot intersect the integral
submanifold f = 0. Then, the integral manifold f = 0 is a leaf of the foliation deﬁned by δQrev if it is also a separatrix.
Moreover, it is a special leaf, being a separatrix.
We have shown above that S → 0+ as f → 0+ for ω ∈ C1 everywhere. We can note that, if the condition for δQrev
to be C1 also on f = 0 is relaxed, then the condition

is not suﬃcient for ensuring (N). A simple counterexample is given by

where 0 ≤ U, 0 < V1 < V and where f dω vanishes as f → 0+ but (N) is violated.
The requirement that ω is C1 everywhere is, at the same time, too restrictive. In fact, it is evident that the following

setting

Notice that, because of the concavity of S, one cannot have
R
and concave entropy cannot diverge (cf. sect. VII). Thus, once ensured the concavity property for S (cf. [39]), one
has only to check if the above integral diverges along any rectiﬁable curve approaching the surface T = 0.

Notice that, in this form, the above theorem allows to neglect the problem of the actual presence of the boundary
T = 0 in the physical manifold. This formulation is also coherent with the fact that (N) is formulated as a limit for
T → 0+.
If (N) is violated and the limit limT →0+ S exists, then (103) is integrable along any path approaching T = 0 with
positive entropy (it is not integrable along any path approaching T = 0 with vanishing entropy). For example, let us
consider the following toy-model Pfaﬃan form

The integrating factor f vanishes as U → 0. ω/f is integrable along any path such that V /N > −β0/α0, in fact, if
g(V, N ) stays for a positive function, one has f ∼ U 2/3 g(V, N ) as U → 0+. If V /N = −β0/α0, then f ∼ 3 U as
U → 0+ and ω/f is no more integrable near U = 0. Notice that the entropy which corresponds to this Pfaﬃan form
is S = 3 (U V N )1/3 + α0 V + β0 N ≥ 0. (N) is violated and S vanishes on the submanifold U = 0, V /N = −β0/α0.
Notice that, if S is not concave but simply positive, then condition (HOM) is still equivalent to (N).
Notice that (HOM) is not aﬀected by the connectedness properties of f = 0.

I. a suﬃcient condition for a continuous S at T = 0

.
The entropy S is required to be continuous at T = 0. This can be obtained as follows. It is evident that the
continuity of ˆS implies the continuity of S. Then, one can impose conditions which allow ˆS to be continuous at T = 0.
Nevertheless, the continuity of ˆS excludes, by direct inspection, the possibility to obtain S = 0 at T = 0. Thus,
one has to ﬁnd further conditions on ˆS in order to allow the possibility to get a vanishing entropy at T = 0. Let us
consider

function φ( ˆB) such that

d ˆB 1/f is uniformly convergent and, being ˆS continuous for ˆB > 0, one ﬁnds that ˆS can be extended
Then
continuously also at ˆB = 0. This condition ensures that (N) is violated. The above condition does not leave room for
S = 0 for some (but not all) values of X 1, . . . , X n+1 ∈ D. Actually, continuity on a open bounded subset R ⊂ IRn+1∩D
of the allowed values for the variables X 1, . . . , X n+1, can be also obtained by assuming that (107) holds on R and
not for any open bounded set C contained in D. In this case, ˆS is continuous at T = 0 for X 1, . . . , X n+1 ∈ R.
In order to obtain a condition ensuring (N) a suﬃcient condition is the following: there exists a positive function
φ( ˆB) such that

1
f ( ˆB, X 1, . . . , X n+1)

> φ( ˆB) ∀ ˆB ∈ (0, ˆB0] and ∀X 1, . . . , X n+1 ∈ C,

where again C ⊂ IRn+1 ∩ D is any open bounded set, and

ˆB

lim
ˆB→0+ Z

ˆB0

d ˆB φ( ˆB) = −∞.

Then, because the above divergence of the integral is uniform in X 1, . . . , X n+1, one ﬁnds that ˆS = log(S) → −∞ as
T → 0+, i.e. S → 0+ as T → 0+. Even in this case, one can allow the function φ( ˆB) to be diﬀerent for diﬀerent
subsets whose union covers all the values of the deformation parameters.

We can consider

due to the singularity in the integrand in f = 0, when one considers a path approaching T = 0 the integral has to be
intended as improper integral. Nevertheless, according to a common use, we bypass this speciﬁcation in the following.
We can write

ˆS( ˆB, X 1, . . . , X n+1) − ˆS( ˆB0, X 1, . . . , X n+1) =

We can see that, if ω ∈ C1(D ∪ ∂D), then the above integral diverges in such a way that S → 0+ for ˆB → 0+. In
fact, one has

ˆξi( ˆB, X 1, . . . , X n+1) = ξk( ˆB, X 1, . . . , X n+1) − ξk(0, X 1, . . . , X n+1) =

where surely k(0, X 1, . . . , X n+1) > 0 because ˆf ≥ 0. As a consequence, near ˆB = 0 the integrand behaves as follows:

J. inaccessibility (C) and the failure of (N)

(114)

(115)

(116)

If (N) holds, the surface T = 0 is adiabatically inaccessible along any adiabatic reversible transformation starting
at T > 0, and it is a leaf of a foliation. There is no isoentropic surface reaching T = 0 and the property (U) of
unattainability is automatically ensured, as well as the principle of adiabatic inaccessibility (C).

The violation of (N) is instead very problematic from the point of view of (C) and of the foliation of the thermody-
namic manifold. If (N) is violated, T = 0 is not a leaf and it is possible to reach T = 0 along inner (would-be) leaves
S = const. Actually, one does not ﬁnd a foliation of the whole thermodynamic domain; if T = 0 is included in the
thermodynamic manifold, one ﬁnds an “almost-foliation”, i.e. a foliation except for a zero-measure manifold, in the
sense that to the proper inner foliation generated at T > 0 is joined a integral manifold T = 0 (the adiabatic boundary
of the thermodynamic domain) which breaks the adiabatic inaccessibility, even if only along special paths passing
through T = 0. In the spirit of the thermodynamic formalism, we agree with Einstein’s statement that the existence of
such adiabatic paths is “very hurtful to one’s physical sensibilities” [23]. It is also evident that the Carnot-Nernst cycle
discussed in sect. IV A is allowed, unless some discontinuity occurs or the thermodynamic formalism fails according
to Planck’s objection, and that the objections against its actual performability can hold only in restricted operative
conditions (from a mathematical point of view, a path contained in the surface T = 0 is diﬀerent from a isoentropic
path at T > 0 reaching the absolute zero of the temperature). Moreover, the approach to the problem by means of
δQrev reveals in a straightforward way aspects which other approaches cannot easily point out.

A further remark is to some extent suggested by black hole thermodynamics, where (N) is violated but states at
T = 0 have S = 0. Cf. [20] for a study in terms of Pfaﬃan forms. In order to avoid problems occurring with the
surface T = 0 if (N) is violated, one could introduce a further hypothesis. One could impose that the entropy is
discontinuous at T = 0, and that

Σ0 <

inf
V,X 1,...,X n

Σ(V, X 1, . . . , X n).

(117)

One could then impose that Σ0 = 0 for all the systems, which would allow to recover an universal behavior. Even
the adiabatic inaccessibility would be restored, because the second law would inhibit to reach T = 0 adiabatically.
This behavior characterizes black hole thermodynamics. Concavity would be preserved, as well as superadditivity.
However this choice is arbitrary and even unsatisfactory, because a well-behaved foliation of the thermodynamic
manifold is obtained by hand by means of the discontinuous entropy S just constructed. In fact, the foliation of the
thermodynamic manifold, if (N) is violated, is obtained as the union of the usual foliation at T > 0 and a special leaf
at T = 0. This foliation is generated by a Pfaﬃan form only in the inner part of the manifold.

VII. NOTES ON GIBBSIAN APPROACH

We recall that in Gibbsian approach [47], the existence of the entropy is a postulate, because the entropy appears
in an axiomatic framework. See also Refs. [48,49,17]. In a certain sense, very loosely speaking, Gibbs starts where
Carath´eodory leaves [50]. This can be considered the reason why in Gibbsian approach the problems which can be
associated with the surface T = 0 as in the previous section appear to be less evident.
Let us assume the Gibbsian approach to thermodynamics, and write the so-called fundamental equation in the entropy
representation:

S = S(U, X 1, · · · , X n+1)

(118)

where X 1, · · · , X n+1 are extensive deformation variables and U is the internal energy. S is required to be a ﬁrst order
positively homogeneous function and, moreover, a concave function (for mathematical details about convexity we refer
to Refs. [51,52]). The former property ensures the extensivity of the entropy, the latter ensures the thermodynamic
stability of the system against thermodynamic ﬂuctuations. The second law ∆S ≥ 0 for an insulated system is also
ensured.

Let us deﬁne

A. extension of S to T = 0

I(U, X 1, · · · , X n+1) = −S(U, X 1, · · · , X n+1).

(119)

In what follows, x stays for a state in the thermodynamic manifold: x ≡ (U, X 1, · · · , X n+1). The function I(x) is, by
deﬁnition, a convex function and positively homogeneous function. As a consequence, its epigraph is a convex cone.
This convex function I is deﬁned on C [we change symbol for the domain, what follows holds for a generic convex
function in a generic convex domain]. There is a preliminary problem. One has to deﬁne I(x) on the boundary ∂C
and obtain again a convex function. This is made as follows [52]: I can be extended to the set

The above extension is convex on a convex set. In general, one cannot substitute lim inf x→y I(x) with limx→y I(x)
because the latter may not exist [52]. Moreover, the behavior of the convex function I = −S at the boundary has to
be such that

for any x0 belonging to the boundary of the convex domain [cf. problem F p. 95 of Ref. [52]].

In the case of S, then the non-existence of the above limit can be considered unphysical. In fact, it can also mean
that the entropy could approach a diﬀerent value for the same state along diﬀerent paths starting at the same initial
point. In the latter case, its nature of state function would be jeopardized, it requires at least the existence of the
limit, that is, the independence of the limit from the path chosen. On this topic, see in particular [2,3]. In any case,
the deﬁnition oﬀered by the theory of convex functions

is a rigorous formal prescription, but it is not clear to the present author if it could be relevant to the physics at hand,
if the limit does not exists.
Then, we assume that S admits a limit for each point of the boundary T = 0, thus

F = C ∪ ∂Cf ,
where
∂Cf ≡ {y ∈ ∂C | lim inf
x→y

I(x) < ∞}

and
I(y) ≡ lim inf
x→y

I(x) ∀ y ∈ ∂Cf .

lim inf
x→x0

I(x) > −∞

S(y) ≡ lim sup

S(x) ∀ y ∈ ∂Cf

x→y

S(y) ≡ lim
x→y

S(x) ∀ y ∈ {T = 0}.

24

(120)

(121)

(122)

(123)

Under this hypothesis, we can extend uniquely S at T = 0. The surface T = 0 represents (a part of) the boundary
∂D for the domain, then it belongs to the closure of the convex open set D. A convex set is dense in its closure. As
a consequence, a continuous function G deﬁned in D can be uniquely extended by continuity on the boundary ∂D if
(and only if), for each point xb ∈ ∂D the limit

exists.
It is still to be stressed that, for a non-negative concave S, one has to ﬁnd limT →0+ S < ∞ as a consequence of (121).

(124)

B. attainment of the lower bound of S

Gibbsian approach allows us to conclude immediately that, if the upper bound I0 of I is attained, then it has to
be attained on the boundary of the thermodynamic manifold (if a convex function I should get a maximum value I0
in a inner point of its convex domain, it would be actually a constant function in its domain) [52]. Then, if the lower
bound S0 of S is attained, it is attained on the boundary of the domain of S. Moreover, under very simple hypotheses
on the domain, the upper bound of I is actually attained [51,52]. In particular, it can be attained at an extreme point
of the boundary. We recall that an extreme point of a convex set is a point belonging to the boundary of the set such
that it is not an inner point of any line segment contained in the set. For example, if the set is a closed rectangle, the
extreme points are the four vertices; if the set is a circle, all the points of the boundary (circumference) are extreme
points. But notice also that, being the thermodynamic domain a convex cone, there is no extreme point apart from
the origin 0 of the cone (which cannot be considered a physically meaningful state [39]).
Note that, given the surface T = 0:

T (U, X 1, . . . , X n+1) = 0
⇔
U = U0(X 1, . . . , X n+1)

then, for each point on this surface, as a consequence of the homogeneity of the entropy, it holds

S(λ U0(X 1, . . . , X n+1), λ X 1, . . . , λ X n+1) = λ S(U0(X 1, . . . , X n+1), X 1, . . . , X n+1).

At the same time, the intensivity (i.e., homogeneity of degree zero) of T implies

T (λ U0(X 1, . . . , X n+1), λ X 1, . . . , λ X n+1) = T (U0(X 1, . . . , X n+1), X 1, . . . , X n+1) = 0.

(127)

Then, if U0(X 1, . . . , X n+1), X 1, . . . , X n+1 ≡ X a

0 , a = 0, . . . , n are the points belonging to the surface T = 0, the cone

K0 ≡ {X a

0 | λ X a

0 ∈ K0, λ > 0}

is contained in the surface T = 0 because of the intensivity of T . As a consequence, in case of violation of (N), one
could ﬁnd a system at T = 0 having an arbitrarily high entropy. Only if S = 0 at T = 0 this cannot happen, because
S = 0 is a ﬁxed point under scaling of the entropy.

(125)

(126)

(128)

C. values of S at T = 0 and the hypothesis of multi-branching

We have assumed a continuous S at T = 0. From the point of view of the Landsberg’s discussion about a multi-
branching near T = 0, we have then simply to discuss the following topological problem. Is the set Z(T ) a connected
set? In the case it is connected, then we can surely conclude that no multi-branching can occur near T = 0. In fact,
the range of a continuous function on a connected set is a connected set, that is, the range of S at T = 0 is a connected
set contained in IR. It has to be an interval (violation of (N)) or a single point (validity of (N)). It is interesting to
underline that, even if the set Z(T ) is not connected, (HOM) ensures the validity of (N) and viceversa (there is no
possibility to ﬁnd two branches like the ones in Fig. (1a), because both have to start at S = 0, T = 0). A possibility
for getting a multi-branching is to violate the concavity at least near T = 0. For an interesting example see Ref. [20].
[Another possibility to get a multi-branching could be to consider a system allowing for states at T < 0, but in this
case two distinct branches would be found on two diﬀerent sides of T = 0].

25

D. violation of (N) and Landsberg’s hypothesis

Consider the following toy-model:

where γ0 > 0, δ0 > 0 and 0 < α < 1. Then

S = γ0 V 1−α U α + δ0 V

1

T =

γ0 α (cid:18)

1−α

U
V (cid:19)

which vanishes as U → 0+: T = 0 ⇔ U = 0. For the domain let us consider F = {U ≥ 0} ∪ {V ≥ V0}. I is
maximum, that is, S is minimum, at the extreme point (0, V0), as it is evident.
[Notice that in this example the
domain is not a convex cone because we introduce a lower bound V0 for V , as it is physically reasonable in order to
justify thermodynamics on a statistical mechanical ground. If one considers F = {U ≥ 0} ∪ {V > 0}, then inf(S) = 0,
which is approached at the only extreme point (0, 0) of the cone]. If δ > 0, then (N) is violated and S can assume
an interval of values at T = 0. If δ0 = 0, then (N) is satisﬁed and I is maximal on the line U = 0. A special case is
represented by the photon gas, where α = 3/4.
This toy-model corresponds to the following behavior of S as a function of T and V :

which, for δ0 6= 0, violates (N). It is useful to pass to the energy representation

The domain is G = {V0 ≤ V ≤ S/δ0}. The T = 0 surface corresponds to V = S/δ0. We have

the pressure is

and reaches T = 0 when V = S0/δ0 during an adiabatic expansion. It is easy to see that it is tangent to the T = 0
surface. The adiabatic expansion has to stop there, because of the structure of the domain. One can wonder if
any physical reason for such a stopping exists. It is useful to come back to Landsberg’s suggestion about a possible
vanishing of the adiabatic compressibility:

In our case, we get

and three cases occur: when 1/2 < α < 1 then KS → 0 as T → 0+, in such a way that the elastic constants of
the system diverge in that limit, forbidding any further expansion (Landsberg’s behavior); when 0 < α < 1/2 then
KS → ∞ as T → 0+, the elastic constants vanish and the behavior of the system is pathologic (the system appears to
0 V 2/(2 S2) which is in any case ﬁnite (S is surely

positive and not zero) and a physical hindrance against reaching T = 0 is not apparent. For α = 3/4 the behavior for
S as T → 0+ is like the one of Debye model, except for the shift δ0V which allows the violation of (N); the adiabatic
expansion stops at T = 0 because of a vanishing KS. For α = 1/2 one obtains a behavior similar to the one of an
electron gas near T = 0, except for the shift δ0V ; no vanishing or divergence of KS is allowed at T = 0.
We wish to underline that, if one consider the entropic fundamental equation of an electron gas at low temperature
and shifts it by δ0 V , then the situation is still diﬀerent, because of the zero-point mode contribution. In fact, such a
contribution allows to get a positive and ﬁnite p as T → 0+ and, moreover, a positive and ﬁnite KS,N as T → 0+ (the
domain is V > 0, N > 0, U ≥ U0(V, N ), where N is the particle number). As a consequence, Landsberg’s mechanism
does not seem to be available. Instead, even if the zero-point mode contribution is taken into account in the case of
a Debye crystal, the pressure is still positive as T → 0+ but KS,N vanishes.

E. further properties

Another point that can be underlined is the following. Let us assume to extend the convex function I = −S to
all of IRn, by deﬁning I = +∞ outside its domain dom I. Then, replace this function with its closure. This is the
same procedure which is prescribed in Ref. [53] for the internal energy U . Then I is a closed proper convex function
which is essentially smooth, that is, |∇ I| → ∞ for any subsequence converging to a boundary point. In fact, in the
gradient of I appears the factor 1/T which diverges as the boundary T = 0 is approached. This allows to obtain in
thermodynamics a convex function of Legendre type, which is relevant for the discussion of Legendre transformations
in thermodynamics. The diﬀerence of the entropy representation with respect to the energy representation is evident
from this point of view. In fact, the opposite conclusion appears in Ref. [53] for the energy representation: no Leg-
endre type function exists in thermodynamics. But we think, from the discussion of the previous section, that the
entropy representation is more fundamental with respect to the energy representation at least for the discussion of
the boundary T = 0.

Summarizing our analysis in Gibbs framework:

g1) if S ≥ 0 , then S = 0 can be attained at a point of the boundary of the domain;
g2) it could be that S > 0 at other points on the surface T = 0. Then, homogeneity implies that, by scaling, a system
with an arbitrarily high zero temperature entropy could be obtained;
g3) models exist where the violation of (N) does not imply the attainability of T = 0 and the violation of ∆S = 0 for
adiabatic reversible transformations (states at T = 0 are not available and so no such violation can occur at T = 0).
But these systems display a non-universal behavior (i.e., a behavior which does not appear in other models).

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have discussed the status of third law of thermodynamics and we have given an heuristic argument in favor of
the entropic version of the third law. Then, we have analyzed the law both in Carath´eodory’s approach and in Gibbs’
approach to thermodynamics.

In particular, Carath´eodory’s approach shows that for T > 0 the thermodynamic manifold can be foliated into
leaves which correspond to isoentropic surfaces. The only hypothesis is that the Pfaﬃan form δQrev is integrable and
C1 in the inner part (T > 0) of the thermodynamic manifold. At the boundary T = 0, which is assumed to be an
integral manifold of the Pfaﬃan form δQrev, the aforementioned Pfaﬃan form is allowed to be also only continuous.
The special integral manifold T = 0 is problematic from a physical point of view, because it can also be intersected
by the inner (would-be) leaves S = const. In the latter case, (N) is violated and one obtains an almost-foliation of
the thermodynamic manifold, where the inaccessibility property fails, even if only along special adiabatic paths which
pass through the surface T = 0. For an entropy which is continuous also at T = 0, (N) holds if and only if T = 0 is a
leaf. This is a remarkable result, the validity of (N) is strongly related to the possibility to obtain a foliation for the
whole thermodynamic manifold, including T = 0. We have shown that, if the Pfaﬃan form is C1 everywhere, then
(N) is preserved. Physical assumptions and mathematical conditions have been discussed.

In another paper [19], further conditions leading to the third law are discussed.
We add herein some notes about the conditions ensuring (N) in quasi-homogeneous thermodynamics introduced in
[54]. Also in the quasi-homogeneous case (N) holds iﬀ limT →0+ S = 0. The analysis of sects. VI F and VI G hold
with obvious changes; moreover, condition (HOM) holds unaltered, and, if the Pfaﬃan form ω is C1 everywhere, then
(N) holds (this can be shown by using a criterion analogous to the one appearing in (VI I 1).

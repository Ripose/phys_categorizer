Abstract

Physical geometry studies mutual disposition of geometrical objects and
points in space, or space-time, which is described by the distance function d,
or by the world function σ = d2/2. One suggests a new general method of the
physical geometry construction. The proper Euclidean geometry is described
in terms of its world function σE. Any physical geometry
is obtained from
the Euclidean geometry as a result of replacement of the Euclidean world
function σE by the world function σ of
. This method is very simple and
eﬀective. It introduces a new geometric property: nondegeneracy of geometry.
Using this method, one can construct deterministic space-time geometries
with primordially stochastic motion of free particles and geometrized particle
mass. Such a space-time geometry deﬁned properly (with quantum constant
as an attribute of geometry) allows one to explain quantum eﬀects as a result
of the statistical description of the stochastic particle motion (without a use
of quantum principles).

1 Introduction

A geometry lies in the foundation of physics, and a true conception of geometry is
very important for the consequent development of physics. It is common practice to
think that all problems in foundations of geometry have been solved many years ago.
It is valid, but this concerns the geometry considered to be a logical construction.
Physicists are interested in the geometry considered as a science on mutual dispo-
sition of geometrical objects in the space or in the space-time. The two aspects of
geometry are quite diﬀerent, and one can speak about two diﬀerent geometries, using

1

for them two diﬀerent terms. Geometry as a logical construction is a homogeneous
geometry, where all points have the same properties. Well known mathematician
Felix Klein [1] believed that only the homogeneous geometry deserves to be called
a geometry. It is his opinion that the Riemannian geometry (in general, inhomoge-
neous geometry) should be qualiﬁed as a Riemannian geography, or a Riemannian
topography. In other words, Felix Klein considered a geometry mainly as a logical
construction. We shall refer to such a geometry as the mathematical geometry.

The geometry considered to be a science on mutual disposition of geometric ob-
jects will be referred to as a physical geometry, because the physicists are interested
mainly in this aspect of a geometry. The physical geometries are inhomogeneous,
in general, although they may be homogeneous also. On the one hand, the proper
Euclidean geometry is a physical geometry. On the other hand, it is a logical con-
struction, because it is homogeneous and can be constructed of simple elements
(points, straights, planes, etc.). All elements of the Euclidean geometry have sim-
ilar properties, which are described by axioms. Similarity of geometrical elements
allows one to construct the mathematical (homogeneous) geometry by means of log-
ical reasonings. The proper Euclidean geometry was constructed many years ago by
Euclid. Consistency of this construction was investigated and proved in [2]. Such a
construction is very complicated even in the case of the proper Euclidean geometry,
because simple geometrical objects are used for construction of the more compli-
cated ones, and one cannot construct a complicated geometrical object
without
construction of the more simple constituents of this object.

O

Note that constructing his geometry, Euclid did not use coordinates for labeling
of the space points. His description of the homogeneous geometry was coordinate-
less. It means that the coordinates are not a necessary attribute of the geometry.
Coordinate system is a method of the geometry description, which may or may not
be used. Application of coordinates and of other means of description poses the
problem of separation of the geometry properties from the properties of the means
of the description. Usually the separation of the geometry properties from the co-
ordinate system properties is carried out as follows. The geometry is described in
all possible coordinate systems. Transformations from one coordinate system to the
another one form a group of transformation. Invariants of this transformation group
are the same in all coordinate system, and hence, they describe properties of the
geometry in question.

and of all relations

At this point we are to make a very important remark. Any geometry is a total-
ity of all geometric objects
between them. Any geometric
is a subset of points of some point set Ω, where the geometry is given.
object
In the Riemannian geometry (and in other inhomogeneous geometries) the set Ω is
supposed to be a n-dimensional manifold, whose points P are labelled by n coor-
dinates x =
. This labelling (arithmetization of space) is considered
}
to be a necessary attribute of the Riemannian geometry. Most geometers believe
that the Riemannian geometry (and physical geometry), in general cannot be con-
structed without introduction of the manifold. In other words, they believe that
the manifold is an attribute of the Riemannian geometry (and of any continuous

x1, x2, ...xn

geometry, in general). This belief is founded on the fact, that the Riemannian ge-
ometry is always constructed on some manifold. But this belief is a delusion. The
fact, that we always construct the physical geometry on some manifold, does not
mean that the physical geometry cannot be constructed without a reference to a
manifold, or to a coordinate system. Of course, some labelling of the spatial points
(coordinate system) is convenient, but this labelling has no relations to the con-
struction of the geometry, and the physical geometry should be constructed without
a reference to coordinate system. Application of the coordinate system imposes con-
straints on properties of the constructed physical geometry. For instance, if we use a
continuous coordinate system (manifold) we can construct only continuous physical
geometry. To construct a discrete physical geometry, the geometry construction is
not to contain a reference to the coordinate system.

Here we present the method of the physical geometry construction, which does
not contain a reference to the coordinate system and other means of description. It
contains a reference only to the distance function d, which is a real characteristic of
physical geometry.

If a geometry is inhomogeneous, and the straights located in diﬀerent places have
diﬀerent properties, it is impossible to describe properties of straights by means of
axioms, because there are no such axioms for the whole geometry. Mutual disposi-
tion of points in a physical (inhomogeneous) geometry, which is given on the set Ω
of points P , is described by the distance function d (P, Q)

d :

Ω

(1.1)

where R denotes the set of all real numbers. The distance function d is the main
characteristic of the physical geometry. Besides, the distance function d is an unique
characteristic of any physical geometry. The distance function d determines com-
pletely the physical geometry, and one does not need any additional information for
determination of the physical geometry. This statement is very important for con-
struction of a physical geometry. It will be proved below. Any physical geometry
G
is constructed on the basis of the proper Euclidean geometry
GE by means of a defor-
mation, i.e. by a replacement of the Euclidean distance function dE by the distance
function of the geometry in question. For instance, constructing the Riemannian
gEikdxidxk by the
geometry, we replace the Euclidean inﬁnitesimal distance dSE =
gikdxidxk. There is no method of the inhomogeneous phys-
Riemannian one dS =
ical geometry construction other, than the deformation of the Euclidean geometry
(or some other homogeneous geometry) which is constructed as a mathematical ge-
ometry on the basis of its axiomatics and logic. Unfortunately, conventional method
of the Riemannian geometry construction contains a reference to the coordinate sys-
tem. But this reference can be eliminated, provided that we use ﬁnite distances d
instead of inﬁnitesimal distances dS.

For description of a physical geometry one uses the world function σ [3], which
is connected with the distance function d by means of the relation σ (P, Q) =
1
2d2 (P, Q). The world function σ of the σ-space V =
is deﬁned by the

(1.2)

where R denotes the set of all real numbers. Application of the world function is
more convenient in the relation that the world function is real, when the distance
function d is imaginary and does not satisfy deﬁnition (1.1). It is important at the
consideration of the space-time geometry as a physical geometry.

In general, a physical geometry cannot be constructed as a logical building,
because any change of the world function should be accompanied by a change of
axiomatics. This is practically aerial, because the set of possible physical geometries
is continual. Does the world function contain full information which is necessary for
construction of the physical geometry? It is a very important question. For instance,
can one derive the space dimension from the world function in the case of Euclidean
geometry? Slightly below we shall answer this question in the aﬃrmative. Now we
formulate the method of the physical geometry construction.
Let us imagine that the proper Euclidean geometry

pletely in terms and only in terms of the Euclidean world function σE. Such a

Index ’E’ shows that the geometric object is constructed on the basis of the Euclidean
axiomatics. Thus, one can obtain another physical geometry
from the Euclidean

geometry
no axiomatics and no reasonings. One needs no means of descriptions (topological
structures, continuity, coordinate system, manifold, dimension, etc.). In fact, one
uses implicitly the axiomatics of the Euclidean geometry, which is deformed by
σ. This replacement may be interpreted as a deformation
the replacement σE →
of the Euclidean space. Absence of a reference to the means of description is an
advantage of the considered method of the geometry construction. Besides, there is
no necessity to construct the whole geometry
. We can construct and investigate
only that part of the geometry
which we are interested in. Any physical geometry
may be constructed as a result of a deformation of the Euclidean geometry.

We do not try to repeat subscriptions of Euclid at construction of the geome-
try. We take the geometrical objects and relations between them, prepared in the
framework of the Euclidean geometry and describe them in terms of the world func-
tion. Thereafter we deform them, replacing the Euclidean world function σE by the
world function σ of the geometry in question. In practice the construction of the
elementary geometry object is reduced to the representation of the corresponding
Euclidean geometrical object in the σ-immanent form, i.e. in terms of the Euclidean
world function. The last problem is the problem of the proper Euclidean geometry.
The problem of representation of the geometrical object (or relation between objects)
in the σ-immanent form is a real problem of the physical geometry construction.

It is very important, that such a construction does not use coordinates and other
methods of description, because the application of the means of description imposes
constraints on the constructed geometry. Any means of description is a structure
St given on the basic Euclidean geometry with the world function σE. Replace-
σ is suﬃcient for construction of unique physical geometry
ment σE →
Gσ. If we
use an additional structure St for construction of physical geometry, we obtain, in
Gσ not for all σ, but only for some
general, other geometry
of world functions σ. Thus, a use of additional means of description restricts the
list of possible physical geometries. For instance, if we use the coordinate descrip-
tion at construction of the physical geometry, the obtained geometry appears to be
continuous, because description by means of the coordinates is eﬀective only for con-
tinuous geometries, where the number of coordinates coincides with the geometry
dimension.

the word. In particular, a deformation of the Euclidean space may transform an
Euclidean surface into a point, and an Euclidean point into a surface. Such a
deformation may remove some points of the Euclidean space, violating its continuity,
or decreasing its dimension. Such a deformation may add supplemental points to the
Euclidean space, increasing its dimension. In other words, the deformation principle
is a very general method of the physical geometry construction.

The deformation principle as a method of the physical geometry construction

(ii) Replacement of the Euclidean world function σE by the world function σ of

A physical geometry, constructed by means of the only deformation principle (i.e.
without a use of other methods of the geometry construction) is called T-geometry
(tubular geometry) [5, 4, 6]. The T-geometry is the most general kind of the physical
geometry.

Application of the deformation principle is restricted by two constraints.

2. The deformation principle is to be applied separately from other methods of
the geometry construction. In particular, one may not use topological structures in
construction of a physical geometry, because for eﬀective application of the defor-
mation principle the obtained physical geometry must be determined only by the
world function (metric).

2 Description of the proper Euclidean space in

terms of the world function

The crucial point of the T-geometry construction is the description of the proper
Euclidean geometry in terms of the Euclidean world function σE. We shall refer
to this method of description as the σ-immanent description. Unfortunately, it
was unknown for many years, although all physicists knew that the inﬁnitesimal
gikdxidxk is the unique essential characteristic of the space-time
interval dS =
geometry, and changing this expression, we change the space-time geometry. From
physical viewpoint the σ-immanent description is very reasonable, because it does
not contain any extrinsic information. The σ-immanent description does not refer
to the means of description (dimension, manifold, coordinate system). Absence of
references to means of description is important in the relation, that there is no
necessity to separate the information on the geometry in itself from the information

q

on the means of description. The σ-immanent description contains only essential
characteristic of geometry: its world function. At ﬁrst the σ-immanent description
was obtained in 1990 [5].

The ﬁrst question concerning the σ-immanent description is as follows. Does the
world function contain suﬃcient information for description of a physical geometry?
The answer is aﬃrmative, at least, in the case of the proper Euclidean geometry,
and this answer is given by the prove of the following theorem.

geometry with additional constraints (2.19), (2.20) imposed on the world function
σ = 1
2ρ2. However it is not so, because the metric geometry does not use the
deformation principle. The fact, that the Euclidean geometry can be described σ-
immanently, as well as the conditions (2.3) - (2.10), were not known until 1990.
Additional (with respect to the σ-space) constraints (2.19), (2.20) are imposed to
eliminate the situation, when the straight line is not a one-dimensional line. The
fact is that, in the metric geometry the shortest (straight) line can be constructed
only in the case, when it is one-dimensional.

Let us consider the set

If the metric space coincides with the proper Euclidean space, this set of points is
an ellipsoid with focuses at the points P, Q and the large semiaxis a. The relations
fP,Q,a (R) > 0, fP,Q,a (R) = 0, fP,Q,a (R) < 0 determine respectively external points,
boundary points and internal points of the ellipsoid. If ρ (P, Q) = 2a, we obtain
T[P Q] of the straight line,
the degenerate ellipsoid, which coincides with the segment
passing through the points P , Q. In the proper Euclidean geometry, the degenerate
ellipsoid is one-dimensional segment of the straight line, but it is not evident that it
is one-dimensional in the case of arbitrary metric geometry. For such a degenerate
ellipsoid be one-dimensional in the arbitrary metric space, it is necessary that any
(P, Q, ρ (P, Q) /2) have no internal points. This constraint

is written in the form

Comparing relation (2.22) with (2.20), we see that the constraint (2.20) is intro-
duced to make the straight (shortest) line to be one-dimensional (absence of internal
points in the geometrical object determined by two points).

As far as the metric geometry does not use the deformation principle, it is a
poor geometry, because in the framework of this geometry one cannot construct the
scalar product of two vectors, deﬁne linear independence of vectors and construct
such geometrical objects as planes. All these objects as well as other are constructed
on the basis of the deformation of the proper Euclidean geometry.

Generalizing the metric geometry, Menger [7] and Blumenthal [8] removed the
triangle axiom (2.20). They tried to construct the distance geometry, which would
be a more general geometry, than the metric one. As far as they did not use the
deformation principle, they could not determine the shortest (straight) line without a

which cannot be expressed only via the distance. As a result the distance geometry
appeared to be not a pure metric geometry, what the T-geometry is.

3 Conditions of the deformation principle

Riemannian geometries satisfy the condition (2.16). The Riemannian geometry is a
kind of inhomogeneous physical geometry, and, hence, it uses the deformation prin-
ciple. Constructing the Riemannian geometry, the inﬁnitesimal Euclidean distance
is deformed into the Riemannian distance. The deformation is chosen in such a way

passing through the point Q0 collinear to the vector P0Q, is not a one-dimensional
line, in general. If the Riemannian geometries be T-geometries, they would contain
non-one-dimensional geodesics (straight lines). But the Riemannian geometries are
not T-geometries, because at their construction one uses not only the deformation
principle, but some other methods, containing a reference to the means of descrip-
tion. In particular, in the Riemannian geometries the absolute parallelism is absent,
and one cannot to deﬁne a straight line (3.1), because the relation P0Q
Q0R is
||
not deﬁned, if points P0 and Q0 do not coincide. On one hand, a lack of absolute
parallelism allows one to go around the problem of non-one-dimensional straight
lines. On the other hand, it makes the Riemannian geometries to be inconsistent,
because they cease to be T-geometries, which are consistent by the construction (see
for details [9]).

The fact is that the application of only deformation principle is suﬃcient for
construction of a physical geometry. Besides, such a construction is consistent, be-
cause the original Euclidean geometry is consistent and, deforming it, we do not

11

use any reasonings. If we introduce additional structure (for instance, a topological
structure) we obtain a fortiﬁed physical geometry, i.e. a physical geometry with
additional structure on it. The physical geometry with additional structure on it
is a more pithy construction, than the physical geometry simply. But it is valid
only in the case, when we consider the additional structure as an addition to the
physical geometry. If we use an additional structure in construction of the geometry,
we identify the additional structure with one of structures of the physical geometry.
If we demand that the additional structure to be a structure of physical geometry,
we restrict an application of the deformation principle and reduce the list of possi-
ble physical geometries, because coincidence of the additional structure with some
structure of a physical geometry is possible not for all physical geometries, but only
for some of them.

Let, for instance, we use concept of a curve

(2.23) for construction of a phys-
ical geometry. The concept of curve
, considered as a continuous mapping is a
topological structure, which cannot be expressed only via the distance or via the
world function. A use of the mapping (2.23) needs an introduction of topological
space and, in particular, the concept of continuity. If we identify the topological
curve (2.23) with the ”metrical” curve, deﬁned as a broken line

segment
Thus, additional structures may lead to (i) a fortiﬁed physical geometry, (ii) a
restricted physical geometry and (iii) a restricted fortiﬁed physical geometry. The
result depends on the method of the additional structure application.

Note that some constraints (continuity, convexity, lack of absolute parallelism),
imposed on physical geometries are a result of a disagreement of the applied means
of the geometry construction. In the T-geometry, which uses only the deformation
principle, there are no such restrictions. Besides, the T-geometry accepts some new
property of a physical geometry, which is not accepted by conventional versions
of physical geometry. This property, called the geometry nondegeneracy, follows
directly from the application of arbitrary deformations to the proper Euclidean
geometry.

The geometry is degenerate at the point P0 in the direction of the vector Q0Q,

of the parallelism of vectors Q0Q and P0R.

The proper Euclidean geometry is degenerate, i.e. it is degenerate at all points
in directions of all vectors. Considering the Minkowski geometry, one should dis-
tinguish between the Minkowski T-geometry and Minkowski geometry. The two
geometries are described by the same world function and diﬀer in the deﬁnition of
the parallelism. In the Minkowski T-geometry the parallelism of two vectors Q0Q
and P0R is deﬁned by the ﬁrst equation (3.3). This deﬁnition is based on the defor-
mation principle. In Minkowski geometry the parallelism is deﬁned by the relation
of the type of (2.13)

The Minkowski T-geometry is degenerate at all points in direction of all timelike
vectors, and it is nondegenerate at all points in direction of all spacelike vectors. The
Minkowski geometry is degenerate at all points in direction of all vectors. Conven-
tionally one uses the Minkowski geometry, ignoring the nondegeneracy in spacelike
directions.

Considering the proper Riemannian geometry, one should distinguish between
the Riemannian T-geometry and the Riemannian geometry. The two geometries are
described by the same world function. They diﬀer in the deﬁnition of the parallelism.
In the Riemannian T-geometry the parallelism of two vectors Q0Q and P0R is
deﬁned by the ﬁrst equation (3.3). In the Riemannian geometry the parallelism of
two vectors Q0Q and P0R is deﬁned only in the case, when the points P0 and Q0
coincide. Parallelism of remote vectors Q0Q and P0R is not deﬁned, in general.
This fact is known as absence of absolute parallelism.

The proper Riemannian T-geometry is locally degenerate, i.e.
it is degenerate
at all points P0 in direction of vectors P0Q. In the general case, when P0 6
= Q0, the
proper Riemannian T-geometry is nondegenerate, in general. The proper Rieman-
nian geometry is degenerate, because it is degenerate locally, whereas the nonlocal
degeneracy is not deﬁned in the Riemannian geometry, because of the lack of abso-
lute parallelism. Conventionally one uses the Riemannian geometry (not Rieman-
nian T-geometry) and ignores the property of the nondegeneracy completely.

From the viewpoint of the conventional approach to the physical geometry the
nondegeneracy is an undesirable property of a physical geometry, although from the
logical viewpoint and from viewpoint of the deformation principle the nondegeneracy
is an inherent property of a physical geometry. The nonlocal nondegeneracy is
ejected from the proper Riemannian geometry by denial of existence of the remote

13

vector parallelism. Nondegeneracy in the spacelike directions is ejected from the
Minkowski geometry by means of the redeﬁnition of the two vectors parallelism. To
appreciate this, let us consider an example.

order µdϑdM = √2d, i.e. of the same order as the segment width. It is reasonable,
because these two phenomena have the common source: the space-time distortion

One should note that the space-time geometry inﬂuences the stochasticity of
particle motion nonlocally in the sense, that the form of the world function (4.2) for
values of σM < 1
d is unessential for the motion stochasticity of the particle of the
mass µd.

2µ2

Such a situation, when the world line of a free particle is stochastic in the de-
terministic geometry, and this stochasticity depends on the particle mass, seems
to be rather exotic and incredible. But experiments show that the motion of real
particles of small mass is stochastic indeed, and this stochasticity increases, when
the particle mass decreases. From physical viewpoint a theoretical foundation of the
stochasticity is desirable, and some researchers invent stochastic geometries, non-
commutative geometries and other exotic geometrical constructions, to obtain the
quantum stochasticity. But in the Riemannian space-time geometry the particle
motion does not depend on the particle mass, and in the framework of the Rie-
mannian space-time geometry it is diﬃcult to explain the quantum stochasticity by
the space-time geometry properties. Distorted geometry
Gd explains the stochas-
ticity and its dependence on the particle mass freely. Besides, at proper choice of
the distortion d the statistical description of stochastic
Tbr leads to the quantum
description (Schr¨odinger equation) [10]. It is suﬃcient to set

where ¯h is the quantum constant, c is the speed of the light, and b is some universal
constant, connecting the geometrical mass µ with the usual particle mass m by
means of the relation

In other words, the distorted space-time geometry (4.2) is closer to the real space-
time geometry, than the Minkowski geometry

5 Statistical description of stochastic world tubes

Statistical description of world lines cannot be a probabilistic statistical description,
because the number of world lines may be negative. Indeed, the density of world
lines in the vicinity of the space-time point x is deﬁned by the relation

dN = jkdSk

(5.1)

(5.2)

where dN is the ﬂux of world lines through the spacelike 3-area dSk. The 4-vector
jk = jk (x) describes the world-lines density in the vicinity of the point x. The
quantity dN may be interpreted as the number of world lines in the vicinity of the
point x. This number may be negative.

In the nonrelativistic case the relation (5.1) turns into the relation

dN = j0dS0 = ρdV

where the particle density j0 = ρ
0, and ρ may be a ground for introduction of
the probability density. In the relativistic case one cannot introduce the probability
density, because the world line density is described by the 4-vector jk.

≥

For statistical description of stochastic world lines we use the dynamical con-
ception of statistical description (DCSD), which does not use the concept of the
probability [11].

6 Determination of the eﬀective mass

We are going to show, that the change (5.39) follows from the form of the world
function (4.2). In reality in [10] the inverse problem has been solved. What is the
geometry of the uniform space-time, if the statistical description of free nonrelativis-
tic particles leads to the quantum description in terms of the Schr¨odinger equation?
Having solved this problem, we obtained the world function (4.2). Now we show that
the eﬀective mass meﬀ of the nonrelativistic particle is determined by the relation
(5.39).

Mathematical formalism of theoretical physics is suited for application in the
Minkowski space-time. Mathematical formalism for work in the distorted space-
time Vd with the world function (4.2) is absent now. We are forced to work in
the Minkowski space-time, using conventional technique and taking into account
distortion of the space-time by means of some corrections.

Let introduce the notion of the adduced vector ~p = ~p (a, P0, P1) as a totality of

a real or imaginary number a and two points

P0, P1}

{

~p = ~p (a, P0, P1) = a (P0P1) = aP0P1

(6.1)

The number a is called the gauge of the adduced vector. The vector P0P1 is a
partial case of the adduced vector aP0P1 with the gauge a = 1. The scalar product
of two adduced vectors a1P0P1 and a2Q0Q1 is deﬁned by the relation

(a1P0P1.a2Q0Q1) = a1a2 (P0P1.Q0Q1)

(6.2)

We shall consider statistical ensemble of relativistic particles, described by the

action (5.36) with the oriented mass mo, deﬁned by the relation

mo = bµo,

µo = (P0P1.~u (R))

(6.3)

where ~u = ~u (R) is the unit adduced vector of the 4-velocity at the point R
∈ T[P0P1],
P0P1 is the momentum vector, divided by the speed of the light c. The quantity

23

(6.4)

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

mo is called the oriented mass because it depends on the mutual orientation of the
momentum vector and of the 4-velocity. The oriented mass mo has diﬀerent sign for
the particle and for the antiparticle.

The 4-velocity ~u = ~u (R) is the unit adduced vector inside the segment

Thus, the particle mass moM, deﬁned by the relation (6.3) and calculated in VM
depends on the point R on the surface of the segment
T[P0P1]. We use in the action
(5.36) some eﬀective mass meﬀ, calculated in accordance with (6.8) in the Minkowski
space-time VM by means of the relation

meﬀ = b (P0P1.~ueﬀ)M

This result coincides with the relation (5.39).

We admit that there are another methods of calculation of the value of meﬀ,
which give another result.
In this case we should choose another world function
of the space-time Vd, which leads to the result (6.21), because we know that the
eﬀective mass, determined by the relation (6.21) agrees with the experimental data.
We know about the distorted space-time geometry only that it generates stochastic
motion of free particles.
Information on its world function is obtained from the
demand that the world function leads to the eﬀective mass, which is determined by
the relation (6.21).

Further development of the statistical description of geometrical stochasticity
leads to a creation of the model conception of quantum phenomena (MCQP), which
relates to the conventional quantum theory approximately in the same way as the
statistical physics relates to the axiomatic thermodynamics. MCQP is the well de-
ﬁned relativistic conception with eﬀective methods of investigation [13], whereas the
conventional quantum theory is not well deﬁned, because it uses incorrect space-time
geometry, whose incorrectness is compensated by additional hypotheses (quantum
principles). Besides, it has problems with application of the nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics technique to the description of relativistic phenomena.

The geometry

Gd is a homogeneous geometry as well as the Minkowski geometry,
because the world function σd is invariant with respect to all coordinate transforma-
tions, with respect to which the world function σM is invariant. In this connection
the question arises, whether one could invent some axiomatics for
Gd and derive the
Gd from this axiomatics by means of proper reasonings. Note that such an
geometry
axiomatics is to depend on the parameter d, because the world function σd depends
on this parameter. If d = 0, this axiomatics is to coincide with the axiomatics of
= 0, this axiomatics cannot coincide with the ax-

the invention of axiomatics, depending on the parameter d and in the general case on
the distortion function D, seems to be a very diﬃcult problem. Besides, why invent
the axiomatics? We had derived the axiomatics for the proper Euclidean geometry,
when we constructed it before. There is no necessity to repeat this process any
time, when we construct a new geometry. It is suﬃcient to apply the deformation
principle to the constructed Euclidean geometry written σ-immanently. Application
of the deformation principle to the Euclidean geometry is a very simple and general
procedure, which is not restricted by continuity, convexity and other artiﬁcial con-
straints, generated by our preconceived approach to the physical geometry. (Bias of
the approach is displayed in the antecedent supposition on the one-dimensionality
of any straight line in any physical geometry, which reminds the statement of the
ancient Egyptians that all rivers ﬂow towards the North).

Thus, we have seen that the nondegeneracy of the physical geometry as well
as non-one-dimensionality of the straight line are properties of the real physical
geometries. The proper Euclidean geometry is a ground for all physical geometries.
Although it is a degenerate geometry, it is beyond reason to deny an existence of
nondegenerate physical geometries.

Thus, the deformation principle together with the σ-immanent description ap-
pears to be a very eﬀective mathematical tool for construction of physical geometries.

1. The deformation principle uses results obtained at construction of the proper
Euclidean geometry and does not add any additional supposition on properties
of geometrical objects.

2. The deformation principle uses only the real characteristic of the physical
geometry – its world function and does not use any additional means of de-
scription.

3. The deformation principle is very simple and allows one to investigate only

that part of geometry which one is interested in.

4. Application of the deformation principle allows one to obtain the true space-
time geometry, whose unexpected properties cannot be obtained at the con-
ventional approach to physical geometry.

not contribute to dynamic equation. The terms of the form ξα,k∂J/∂ξ0,k vanish due

We hope that in the case n = 2 equations (A.20) have a solution for any functions
g, because in this case the number (four) of real components of ψ coincides with
the number of hydrodynamic variables jk (k = 0, , 2, 3). (But this statement is not
yet proved). For the two-component function ψ (n = 2) the following identity takes

Abstract

Special relativity, the symmetry breakdown in the electroweak standard
model, and the dichotomy of the spacetime related transformations with the
Lorentz group, on the one side, and the chargelike transformations with the
hypercharge and isospin group, on the other side, are discussed under the com-
mon concept of “relativity”. A relativity is deﬁned by classes G/H of a “little”
group in a “general” group of operations. Relativities are representable as lin-
ear transformations that are considered for ﬁve physically relevant examples.

1 Five relativities for an introduction

Basic physical theories involve both external and internal degrees of freedom
that are acted on, respectively, by operations from the Poincar´e group, i.e.,
Lorentz group and spacetime translations, and by operations from the hyper-
charge, isospin and color group. The properties of all basic interactions and
particles are determined and characterized by invariants and eigenvalues for
these operation groups. Although the product of external and internal oper-
ations in the acting group is direct, the internal “chargelike” operations are
coupled to the external “spacetimelike” ones: any spacetime translation is ac-
companied by a chargelike operation. This is implemented by the gauge ﬁelds
in the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions. In the following,
the dichotomy and the connection of external and internal operations will be
discussed under the label “unitary relativity”, especially with respect to its
representations by interactions and particles.

To see its general and its speciﬁc structures, unitary relativity will be in-
troduced and considered as one example in ﬁve relativities: perpendicular
relativity as realized after discovering the surface of the earth to be spherical,
rotation relativity, or space and time relativity, as used in what we call special
relativity with “timelike” and “spacelike” translations, Lorentz group relativ-
ity, or Minkowski spacetime relativity, as an important ingredient of general
relativity, electromagnetic relativity as formulated in the standard model of
electroweak interactions [10] and ﬁnally, and that is mostly new, unitary rela-
tivity.

Relativity will be deﬁned by operation groups, an example:

In special
relativity, the distinction of your rest system determines a decomposition of
spacetime translations into time and position translations. Compatible with
this decomposition is your position rotation group SO(3) as a subgroup of the
orthochronous Lorentz group SO0(1, 3). There are as many decompositions
of spacetime into time and position as there are rotation groups in a Lorentz
group. The rotation group classes are parametrizable by the points of a one
∼= SO0(1, 3)/SO(3) that give the momenta
shell 3-dimensional hyperboloid
(velocities) for all possible motions. Another example: The perpendicularities
of mankind, if earthbound, are characterized by the axial rotation groups in a
rotation group and parametrizable by coordinates of the earth’s surface Ω2
∼=
SO(3)/SO(2).

Now in general: The choice of an “idolized” operation group H in a “gen-
eral” operation group G picks one element in the G-symmetric space G/H,
which stands for the relativity of the “idolized” group, called H-relativity. An
“idolization” [1] goes, negatively, with the “narrow-minded” assumption of an
absolute point of view or, positively, with the distinction of a smaller opera-
tion symmetry, enforced, e.g., by initial or boundary conditions. Important
examples are degenerate ground states (“spontaneous symmetry breakdown”)
where an “interaction-symmetry” G is reduced to a “particle-symmetry” H,
e.g., the degenerate ground states of superconductivity, of superﬂuidity, of a
ferromagnetic or of the electroweak standard model. The ground state degen-
eracy is characterized by the symmetric space G/H.

Somewhat in accordance with the historical development, the “general”
operations of one relativity can constitute the “idolized” group of the next
relativity as seen in the two chains ending in full general linear groups, a
real one for spacetime concepts, from ﬂat to spherical earth to special and
general relativity, and a complex one for interactions, from electromagnetic to
electroweak transformations and their spacetime (gauge) dependence:

All groups in the ﬁve relativities considered are real Lie groups. All “gen-
eral” groups are reductive, for perpendicular and rotation relativity even semi-
simple. Perpendicular and electromagnetic relativity have a compact “general”
group. With the exception of Lorentz group relativity, all “idolized” groups are
compact subgroups. The 2nd column contains the dimension of the maximal
abelian subgroups, which is the rank r of the group G generating Lie alge-
bra L = log G, and of the maximal noncompact abelian subgroups, i.e., the
. With the exception of GL(R4), the maximal abelian subgroups
real rank r
allow a unique decomposition into compact Cartan torus and noncompact
Cartan plane. A Cartan torus is a direct product of circle groups in the form
U(1) = exp iR or SO(2) ∼= exp σ3iR, a Cartan plane is a direct product of
additive line groups R (translations), which also can be used in the multiplica-
tive form D(1) = exp R or SO0(1, 1) ∼= exp σ3R. The rank gives the number of
independent invariants, rational or continuous r = n
, that characterize
I
a G-representation. The real rank is the maximal number of the continuous
invariants n

their coupling constants related to the ratio of the two invariants, and, for
4-tangent translations R4, the particles and their masses. The common
the
language for interactions and elementary particles is the representation theory
and harmonic analysis of unitary relativity (more below).

There is a mathematical framework, almost tailored for relativities: the
theory of induced representations, pioneered by Frobenius [3], used for free
particles by Wigner [12] and worked out for noncompact groups especially by
Mackey [6]. There, a subgroup H-representation induces a full group G-re-
presentation leading to a G
H-representation as subrepresentation of the
G-representation. Such a dichotomic transformation
two-sided regular G
G as group and “isogroup”, is familiar,
property with a doubled group, G
with respect to the Lorentz and the isospin group, SU(2)
SU(2) as spin
and isospin, from the ﬁelds in the electroweak standard model. Especially for
noncompact nonabelian groups, the theory is not easy to penetrate. All the
mathematical details are given in the textbooks of Helgason [4], Knapp [5] and
Folland [2] and, especially for distributions, of Treves [9].

In the following, only some motivating and qualititive mathematical re-
marks will be given with respect to this theory, which will be used in physical
implementations. The ﬁrst part of this paper works with ﬁnite-dimensional
relativity structures, which may be not so familiar in such a conceptual frame-
work. After a parametrization of the relativity manifold G/H, there will be
given its fundamental representations, called transmutators, which mediate
the transition from an idolized group H to the full group G. With the funda-
mental transmutators all ﬁnite dimensional relativity representations can be
constructed as used, e.g., in the transition from the ﬁelds for the electroweak
interactions to the asymptotic particles.

The mathematically more demanding second part (“Spacetime and unitary
relativity”) uses representations of noncompact operation groups on Hilbert
spaces, necessarily inﬁnite-dimensional for faithful representations.

2 Relativity parameters

There are operation-induced parameters for the real homogeneous relativity
spaces G/H, e.g., the three momenta (velocities) for rotation (special) relativ-
ity or the three weak coordinates of electromagnetic relativity as used in the
mass modes of the three weak bosons.

The action of a “general” group G on a set S, denoted by

S that are isomorphic to subgroup classes

SO0(1, 3). The SL(C2)-orbit of the metric parametrizes rotation

3 Relativity transitions

Elements of a relativity, i.e., of a homogeneous space G/H, are related to
each other by the action of the full group G, e.g., diﬀerent perpendicularities
by rotations of the earth’s surface or diﬀerent nonrelativistic space-times by
Lorentz transformations of spacetime.

⊆

With real parameters for H-relativity G/H one can partly parametrize the
“general” group G. Each coset can be given a deﬁning representative gr ∈
G as linear operation on a complex vector space. Such representatives

for the harmonic analysis of the group G and its homogeneous spaces G/H,

orthogonality all square integrable induced representations,

for spacetime translations and spin rotations uses non-Hilbert representations

LIENARD-WIECHERT POTENTIALS FOR MODEL
OF EXTENDED SPACE

In the extended (1 + 4) -dimensional space G(T ; ~X, S) it is considered a
model joining electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds. For the equations
circumscribing these ﬁelds, the exact solutions adequate dot moving sources
are found. Such solutions express through potentials Lienard-Wiechert in
space G(T ; ~X, S). Their properties are analyzed.

In works [1,2] was oﬀered the model which extended special theory of relativity (STR)

on 5-dimentional extended space G(T ; ~X, S) with metric

( +,

Within the framework of this extended space model (ESM) was considered possibility to
join the gravitation and electromagnetism in one uniform ﬁeld. The various details concern to
the structure of the ESM is contained in works [3-7]. The experiment on check of predictions
ESM [12,13,14] was made. For it quantitative analysis it is necessary to know exact solutions
of the equations of the ﬁeld, which were formulated in [1,2]. In the given work we shall found
solutions, which appropriate to the point sources.

The principal diﬀerence ESM from STR is, that ESM allows to study processes during
which the mass of a particle m varies. Under a mass of a particle m we, following the
recommendations of the review [8], shall understand it a rest-mass, which is a Lorentz
scalar. In our model mass of a particle - component of a 5-vector in space G(T ; ~X, S), other
components of this 5-vector are energy and impulse. Thus, the mass of a particle, generally
speaking, varies during transformations in space G(T ; ~X, S). But the charge, we assume,
remains constant. We shall emanate also that the charge e is always connected to some
mass m and we compare to a charged particle a parameter me. As a charge e - scalar in
extended space G(T ; ~X, S), parameter me - component of a vector in this space. As the 5-th
additional coordinate we propose to use the interval S which already exists in the Minkowski
space.

This magnitude is saved in case of usual Lorentz transformations in Minkowski space
M(T ; ~X), but varies in case of turns in extended space G(T ; ~X, S). Thus, Minkowski space
M(T ; ~X) is a cone in extended space G(T ; ~X, S). A 5-vector in space G(T ; ~X, S) we shall
designate by a hyphen (¯r), vector in 4-d Euclidean space with coordinates (x, y, z, s). Vector
in it 3-d subspaces are designated by upper narrow and ﬁgure below, indicating dimension-
ality of space, to which this vector concerns: (~v(3), (~v(4)). As a rule, from a context it is clear,
about what of 3-d subspace there is a speech and it data in the nomenclature of a vector

we not indicate. In work [1] was shown, that the uniform ﬁeld joining a gravitation and
an electromagnetism, is generated by a current, which in case of one particle is an isotropic

where

q = me, q~u = me~u(t, x, y, z).

If there are some particles, their common current is a sum of currents of separate particles.
The additional transformations, which are available in extended space G(T ; ~X, S), change
magnitude q similarly to that, as they change a rest-mass m [1,2,3].

In [1] the extended set of Maxwell equations circumscribing this ﬁeld was constructed.

As well as in case of a usual electrodynamics, the strengths express through the components
of 5-vector potential

To receive from system (5) - (7) usual set of equations for vector potential, which is used
in an electrodynamics, it is necessary to take into account, that a mass m - scalar, concern-
ing Lorentz transformations, to divide each of the equations (5) and (6) by this mass m,
and equation (7) divide by charge e, and also to take into account that now all magnitudes
do not depend on a variable s. Therefore operator (8) turns in usual dalembertian. After

The equations (9), (10) describe an electromagnetic ﬁeld of a moving dot charge, and
equation (11) scalar potentials of a gravitational ﬁeld. Thus, in case, when the mass is
ﬁxed, i.e. there is no association from ﬁfth coordinates s, the gravitational and electromag-
netic ﬁelds can be considered separately, dividing the equations (9), (10) and (11). If such
association has a place, they should be considered as one uniform ﬁeld.

For a set of equations of the Maxwell the major role is played by the solution called as
Lienard-Wiechert potentials. This solution gives an obvious aspect of an electromagnetic
ﬁeld, which creates by a charge driven by any, but quite deﬁnitely way. The law of motion
of a charge is the environmental condition, deﬁning structure of a solution. In the given
section we shall construct Lienard-Wiechert potentials for a system (5) - (7). On the formal
structure they look like retarded potentials. The idea of a construction of retarded potentials
is based that the magnitude of strength of a ﬁeld in a point (x, y, z) in an instant t, created
by a driven charge, is set by a position of a charge in some previous instant t′ < t, which
magnitude is determined by the law of motion of a particle. In a usual electrodynamics the
distance between a radiant of a ﬁeld and view point is a distance in 3-d Euclidean space. In
our model to two points in extended space G(T ; ~X, S) is compared 4-d space interval

being a part of a full interval (1).

Let’s discuss a problem - what parameters should be substituted in the formula (13) for

calculation of the Lienard-Wiechert potentials.

Space coordinates (x, y, z), (x′, y′, z′) determine accordingly position of a point in which

measure strength of a ﬁeld in an instant t position of a charge in an instant t′.

In works [1,2,3] was shown, that ﬁfth the coordinate s can be connected with an index

Let’s mark, that this path can and be not a rectilinear segment, it the geometry depends on
distribution of factor of a refraction n(x, y, z). Let viewpoint of a ﬁeld and source are from

For the deﬁnition 4-d distance R(4) it is necessary magnitude (15) to substitute in the
formula (13). 4-d distance R(4), speed of light c, 3-d distance R(3) and speed of light in a
medium v are connected one another by relation

Where n - index of refraction of a medium. Connection of a moment of an emission of a
ﬁeld t′ with a moment of it observation t is determined with the help of relations

which is the same, as the similar relation in usual electrodynamics. The only diﬀerence is
that instead of 3-d distance in this relation stands 4-d distance. The expression (18) is the
equation on time of an emission t′, expressing it in time of observation t. In a free space
it has only one solution [9], however it is known, that in a medium it not and it can have

potentials of a ﬁxed charged particle, and then we shall rewrite them in the form, invariant
concerning transformations in extended space G(T ; ~X, S). If we have a dot particle with a

Here ¯u(t′) - 5-vector of a velocity of a charged particle, ¯R(t′) a position vector connecting

The parameters t and t′ are connected one another by relation (18). Let’s note that the
found in such a way Lienard-Wiechert potentials in extended space G(T ; ~X, S) as a special
case is given by usual Lienard-Wiechert potentials in a continuous medium [10,11]. Their

connection is deﬁned with the help of relation (17). The potentials (29) are solutions of a
system (5) - (7)

f = f (( ~R4, ~v4)).

This not spherical-symmetrical solution, therefore for this statement is not spreaded the
theorem that n -dimensional Laplacian has solution in form of

f = r−n+2, n > 2,

f = ln r n = 2.

That fact that for ﬁxed particles the solution (29) gives usual Coulomb potential imme-
diately follows from the formula (21). Really, solution (29) we have received by passing from
a ﬁxed particle to driven. Therefore, if we stopping particle we shall return from a common

solution (29) to special solution (21). This solution can be rewrite in the form (20), which
in case of blank space (v = c, R3 = R4) gives usual Coulomb potential. Let’s found now

similar on which calculates an electromagnetic ﬁeld in a usual electrodynamics [9]. The
diﬀerence is, that in the formula (31) right parts is divided by a rest-mass of a source of a
current m. In a usual electrodynamics such division is carried out for stages of a construction
of a 4-vector of a current from a 4-vector of an energy - impulse, in our model we refer this
procedure on a moment of an evaluation of strengths of an electromagnetic ﬁeld. Let’s mark,
that so deﬁned ﬁeld ~E is a 2-component tensor in space of the Minkowski M(T ; ~X), but it
not a tensor in extended space G(T ; ~X, S). In this space tensors are the magnitudes (30),
and the strength (31) will be transformed during rotations in space G(T ; ~X, S) under the
much more complicated law.

Substituting here expressions for potentials (29), we shall receive

3-d vector ~R3, and the module 4-d vector R4, in usual electrodynamics in the appropriate
formulas instead of the module 4-d vector R4 stands the module 3-d vector R3.

The formulas (32), (34) give expressions for electrical and magnetic ﬁelds, but with their

help it is possible to receive expressions and for all other strengths (30). For this purpose
it is necessary to take into account, that vector ~u(3), ~R(3) in the formulas (32), (34) is 3-d
vector, which components are selected from the 4-th components 4-d vectors ~u(4), ~R(4). Such
triples of components can be selected by a diﬀerent mode. If we have selected components
x, y, z, we shall receive electrical and magnetic ﬁelds, which diﬀer from usual ﬁelds only by
that now their components depend also on a variable s. If we shall select other triple of
variables, we shall receive other components of a tensor of strength (30). So for example, if
we have selected variables y, z, s, in the formulas (31), (33) there will be a 3-vector potential
~A(3) with components (Ay, Az, As). Accordingly and in the left part of the formula (31) there
will be same components of a 4-vector ~E(4):
(Ey, Ez, Es = Q = F40). The formula (33)
gives in this case strengths Hx, Gy = F42, Gz = F43. The new ﬁelds Q, ~G occur because now
there are 5 potentials (At, ~A, As) and all of them depend also on a new variable s. Let’s

Here we take into account that

~R(y)
(3) = (Rz, Rs, Rx), ~u(y)

(3) = (uz, us, ux).

Thus, we see, that in dependence from what components of the 4-d vectors ~u(4), ~R(4) are
included into the formulas (32), (34), they allow to calculate various gangs of components of
strength tensor (30). Let’s consider now concrete example of a particle with a mass m and
charge e, with ﬁxed space coordinates x, y, z, but the coordinate s can vary. This particle
has follows 4-d state, velocities and acceleration vectors

~R(4) = (x, y, z, Rs) ,

~u(4) = (0, 0, 0, us) , ~˙u(4) = (0, 0, 0, ˙us) .

(40)

Here we use the entered earlier designation Rs, for a distance in 4-d Euclidean space between
source of the ﬁeld and view point. Let’s mark, that for charge moving with a velocity us the
modiﬁcation of the distance Rs happens, but the connection between them is rather compli-
cated and is determined by distribution of an index of refraction n(~r) in all space between
them. For it evaluation should be taken into account relations (16) - (18) and property of a
medium. Using the formula (32), we obtain expression for electric ﬁeld strengths

Rsus > 0,

as the velocity of the charge us always is less than speed of light in a hollow c, and the distance
Rs along the coordinate s always is less than the full distance R(4), due to the source and
view point always are divided spatially. But the numerator of expression (41) can change
a sign in an association with magnitude and sign of acceleration ˙us. If this acceleration is
rather great, i.e. the velocity of a modiﬁcation of an optical density of a medium around
ﬁxed charge is great, the voltage of an electrical ﬁeld ~E will interchange the sign. Thus the
of the charges with the same signs will begin to be attracted, and charges with opposite
signs to be repelled. It is interesting to compare expression (41) with expression for electric
ﬁeld strength, which is received with the help of usual Lienard-Wiechert potential [12]. If
the 3-d velocity is directed along an axes X

In this case electric ﬁeld component Ex

From the formula (44) it is visible, that the component of strength Ex can change the
sign in an association with magnitude and sign of acceleration ˙ux. However, in practice such
modiﬁcation of a sign, i.e. changing of an attraction in repulsion and on the contrary is

rather inconveniently to observe. This is due to the superlarge magnitudes acceleration can
be created only on very short time intervals. And this acceleration should be positive, i.e.
the velocity of the charged particle must sharply increase. The eﬀect of change of a sign of

a force of interaction arises only in that case, when the velocity of a particle is directed not
on a line connecting particle and view point. In other words, the magnitude (R2
z) in
the formula (44) should not be equal to zero. From here follows, that in the case of frontal
motion of charged particles to each other changes of a sign of a force of interaction does

y + R2

not happen. This case has place only, when the aim parameter is not equal to zero. Such
situation can arise, for example, in the case of falling of a charged particle on the Coulomb

center. Near to this center the strength of a ﬁeld is so great that can cause large acceleration
of the incident particle and change of an attraction by repulsion. Let’s return to the analysis
of strength (30) under condition of (40). The ﬁeld Q has an view

From the formula (45) it is visible, that a ﬁeld Q also, as well as the ﬁeld ~E, can change the
sign in an association with a sign and magnitude of acceleration ˙us. As the strengths ~H, ~G
express through ﬁelds ~E, Q with the help of of formulas (35), (38) they also change the sign
in that moment, when it is done by ﬁelds ~E, Q. Such changing of a ﬁeld strength sign and, as
a result, change of a Lorentz force sign it is possible to connect with a response of a radiation

of these ﬁelds, which arises, when charged particles moves with acceleration. The results
obtained in the given work, show, that in the case of generalization of an electrodynamics

on extended space it is possible to save all basic elements of the theory. The ﬁelds of dot
charges are described by generalized Lienard-Wiechert potentials, which allow analyzing their

behavior in a series of concrete cases. This result deﬁnes connection between electromagnetic
and gravitational ﬁelds and determines direction, in which it is necessary to move with the
purpose of a construction of their share theory.

Friendship and Enmity

Abstract

How do social networks evolve when both friendly and unfriendly relations exist?
Here we propose a simple dynamics for social networks in which the sense of a
relationship can change so as to eliminate imbalanced triads—relationship triangles
that contains 1 or 3 unfriendly links. In this dynamics, a friendly link changes to
unfriendly or vice versa in an imbalanced triad to make the triad balanced. Such
networks undergo a dynamic phase transition from a steady state to “utopia”—all
friendly links—as the amount of network friendliness is changed. Basic features of
the long-time dynamics and the phase transition are discussed.

Key words: Social balance, Networks

1 Introduction

As we all have experienced, social networks can evolve in convoluted ways.
Friendships can become estrangements and vice versa. New friendships can
be created while existing friends drift apart. How are these changing relations
reﬂected in the structure of social networks? As a familiar and illustrative
example, suppose that you are friendly with a married couple that gets di-
vorced. A dilemma arises if you try to remain friendly with both of the former
spouses. You may ﬁnd yourself in the uncomfortable position of listening to
each of the former spouses separately disparaging each other. Ultimately you
may ﬁnd it simplest to remain friends with only one of the former spouses
and to cut relations with the other ex-spouse. In the language of social bal-
ance [1,2,3,4], the initially balanced triad became unbalanced when the couple
divorced. When you subsequently kept your friendship with only one former
spouse, social balance is restored.

What happens in a larger social network? Now we need to look at all triads ijk
that link individuals i, j, and k. We deﬁne the link variable sij = 1 if i and j
friends and sij =
1 otherwise. Then the triad ijk is balanced if sijsjkski = 1,
and is imbalanced otherwise (Fig. 1). A balanced triad therefore fulﬁlls the
adage:

−

a friend of my friend as well as an enemy of my enemy is my friend;
a friend of my enemy as well as an enemy of my friend is my enemy.

•
•

A network is balanced if each constituent triad is balanced [1,4]. A seemingly
more general deﬁnition of a balanced network is to require that each closed
ℓ∈path sℓ = +1. Cartwright and Harary showed [5]
cycle is balanced; that is,
that a cycle-based deﬁnition of balance is equivalent to a triad-based deﬁnition
for complete graphs. This result can be reformulated as follows: if we detect
an imbalanced cycle of any length in a complete graph, there must be an
imbalanced triad.

Q

Balance theory was originally introduced by Heider [1] and important con-
tributions were made by many others [2,3,6]. Cartwright and Harary [5,7]
translated Heider’s ideas into the framework of graph theory, and proved sev-
eral fundamental theorems about the structure of balanced networks. There
is also an extensive literature on balance theory (see e.g., [4,8,9,10,11,12,13]
and references therein).

Cartwright and Harary showed that on a complete graph balanced societies
are remarkably simple: either all individuals are mutual friends (“utopia”), or
the network segregates into two mutually antagonistic but internally friendly
cliques—a “bipolar” state [5]. However, spontaneously balanced states are
rare—if one were to assign relationships in a social network at random, the
probability that this society is balanced would vanish exponentially with sys-
tem size. Thus to understand how a network reaches a balanced state we need
to go beyond static descriptions to investigate how an initially imbalanced
society becomes balanced via social dynamics.

Here we discuss the evolution of such social networks when we allow the sense

2

of each link to change from friendly to unfriendly or vice versa to reﬂect the
natural human tendency to reduce imbalanced triads [14,15]. Two such dynam-
ics are considered: local triad dynamics (LTD) and constrained triad dynamics
(CTD). For simplicity, we consider complete graph networks—everyone knows
everyone else. We will address the basic question: what is the long-time state
of such networks?

2 Local Triad Dynamics

2.1 The Update Rule

In local triad dynamics (LTD), an imbalanced triad is selected at random and
the sign of a relationship between two individuals is ﬂipped to restore the triad
to balance. This change is made irregardless if other triads become imbalanced
as a result. Thus LTD can be viewed as the social graces of the clueless—such
a person makes a relationship change without considering the ramiﬁcations
to be of type k if it
on the rest of his social network. We deﬁne a triad
△
contains k unfriendly links. Thus
△2 are balanced, while
△3
are imbalanced. With these deﬁnitions, the LTD rules are (Fig. 2):

p, change a friendly

(3) If the triad is of type

△3, then change an unfriendly link to a friendly

link.

After the update, the initial imbalanced target triad becomes balanced, but
other previously-balanced triads that share a link with this target may become
imbalanced. These triads can subsequently evolve and return to balance, lead-
ing to new imbalanced triads. For example, when a married couple breaks up,
friends of the former couple that remain friends with the former wife may
then redeﬁne their relationships with those who choose to remain friends with

3

the former husband. These redeﬁnitions, may lead to additional relationship
shifts, etc.

2.2 Evolution on the Complete Graph

We now study LTD on a ﬁnite complete graph of N nodes, L =

links, and

N

triads. Let Nk be the number of triads that contain k unfriendly
links, with nk = Nk/N△ the respective triad densities, and L+ (L−) the num-
ber of friendly (unfriendly) links. The number of triads and links are related
by

2.3 The Evolving State

A remarkable feature of the master equations (5) is that if the initial triad
densities are given by Eq. (8)—uncorrelated densities—the densities will re-
main uncorrelated forever. In this case, it suﬃces to study the time evolution
of the density of friendly links ρ(t). We determine this time evolution directly
by noting that ρ(t) increases if
△1 → △0, and decreases if
△3 → △2 or
△1 → △2. Since the respective probabilities for these processes are 1, p, and

For p = 1/2 utopia is reached slowly—as a power-law in time.

2.4 Fate of a Finite Society

Abstractly, LTD represents a stochastic dynamics in a state space in which
each network conﬁguration is represented by a point in this space and a link
to another point represents an allowed transition by the dynamics. Because
balanced networks represent absorbing states of this dynamics, a ﬁnite network
must ultimately fall into a balanced state for all p. We now estimate the size
dependence of the time to reach a balanced state, TN , for any value of p by
probabilistic arguments.

Fig. 5. Eﬀective random walk picture for the approach to balance for p < 1/2.

For p < 1/2, we use the following random walk argument (Fig. 5): when a
link is ﬂipped on an imbalanced triad on an almost balanced network (nearly
N 3/6 balanced triads), then of the order of N triads that contain this link
will become imbalanced. Thus starting near balance, LTD is equivalent to a
biased random walk in the state space of all network conﬁgurations, with the
bias is directed away from balance, and with the bias velocity v proportional
to N. Conversely, far from the balanced state, local triad dynamics is diﬀu-
N
sive because the number of imbalanced triads changes by of the order of
equiprobably in a single update. The corresponding diﬀusion coeﬃcient D is
then proportional to N 2. Since the total number of triads in a network of N
N 3/6, we therefore expect that the time TN to reach balance

TN scales algebraically with N, the exponent is much smaller than 4. The
source of this smaller exponent is the fact that the number of unfriendly links
ﬂuctuates strongly about its mean value when there are few unfriendly links
(see Fig. 6). To determine these ﬂuctuations we write the number of unfriendly
links in the canonical form [17]

U(t) = Lu(t) + √L η(t),

where u(t) is deterministic and η(t) is a stochastic variable. Both u and η

3 Constrained Triad Dynamics

In constrained triad dynamics (CTD), we ﬁrst select an imbalanced triad at
random and then select a random link in this triad. We change the sign of
the link only if the total number of imbalanced triads decreases. If the total
number of imbalanced triads is conserved in an update, then the update occurs
with probability 1/2. CTD can be viewed as the dynamics of a socially aware
individual who considers her entire social circle before making any relationship
change. Because of this global constraint, a network is quickly driven to a
balanced state in a time that scales as ln N.

A more interesting feature is the existence of a dynamical phase transition in
the structure of the ﬁnal state as a function of the initial friendly link density
ρ0 (Fig. 8). We quantify this structural change by the scaled diﬀerence in
C2)/N. For ρ0 < 0.4

the cliques in the ﬁnal state are nearly the same size and
increases toward ρ∗
2/3, the size diﬀerence continuously increases and a

and the density of friendly links ρ∞ are related by
1 in a large
balanced society, uncorrelated initial relations generically lead to ρ∞ > ρ0.
Thus CTD tends to drive a network into a friendlier ﬁnal state.

We now give a simple-minded argument that suggests that a large network
undergoes a sudden change from ρ∞ = 0 (two equal size cliques) to ρ∞ = 1
(utopia) as a function of the initial friendly link density ρ0. This qualitative
approach predicts that this transition occurs at ρ0 = 1/2. On the other hand,
our numerical simulations show that the transition is located near ρ∗

(Fig. 8).

Let us assume that a network remains uncorrelated during initial stages of
evolution and under this assumption we determine the probabilities for a spe-
ciﬁc friendly link to ﬂip. If the network is uncorrelated, the densities n+

For a link to change from friendly to unfriendly, it is necessary that n+

triads. From Eq. (14), this condition is equivalent to 4ρ(1

never holds. Consequently, friendly links never ﬂip. Similarly, the densities

network, only unfriendly links ﬂip in CTD, except for p = 1/2. Thus a network
with ρ0 > 1/2 should quickly evolve to utopia, while a network with ρ0 < 1/2
should quickly approach a state where ρ = 1/2.

Simulations indicate, however, that correlations in relationships occur when

precursor to this bipolar society is a state in which the network partitions
itself by the dynamics into two subnetworks S1 and S2 of nearly equal sizes
C1 =
. Within each subnetwork, the density of friendly links
ρ1 and ρ2 slightly exceeds 1/2, while the density β of friendly links between
subnetworks is slightly less than 1/2. This small ﬂuctuation is ampliﬁed by
CTD so that the ﬁnal state is two nearly equal-size cliques.

To see how such evolution occurs, let us assume that relationships within
each subnetwork and between subnetworks are homogeneous. Consider ﬁrst
the evolution within each clique. For an unfriendly link in S1, the densities
of triads attached to this link are given by (15), with ρ replaced by β when
the third vertex in the triad belongs to S2, and by (15), with ρ replaced by ρ1
when the third vertex belongs to S1. The requirement that a link can change
from unfriendly to friendly by CTD now becomes

Thus if the situation arises where ρ1 > 1/2, ρ2 > 1/2, and β < 1/2, the net-

links and decrease the density of inter-subnetwork friendly links. This bias
drives the network to a ﬁnal bipolar state.

4 Summary and Discussion

We presented a simple setting for social dynamics in which both friendly and
unfriendly links exist in a network. These links evolve according to natural
rules that reﬂect a social desire to avoid imbalanced triads. For local triad
dynamics, a ﬁnite network falls into a socially-balanced state in a time that
depends sensitively on the propensity p for forming a friendly link in an up-
date event. For an inﬁnite network, a balanced state is never reached when
p < 1/2 and the system remains stationary. The density of unfriendly links
gradually decreases and the network undergoes a dynamical phase transition
1/2.
to an absorbing, utopia state for p

≥

For constrained triad dynamics, an arbitrary network is quickly driven to
a balanced state. This rapid evolution results from the condition that the
number of imbalanced triads cannot increase. There is also a phase transition
from bipolarity to utopia as a function of the initial density of friendly links
that arises because of small structural ﬂuctuations that are then ampliﬁed by
the dynamics.

It is interesting to consider the possible role of balance theory in interna-
tional relations [18], with the evolution of the relations among the protago-
nists of World War I being a particularly compelling example (Fig. 10). A
history starts with the Three Emperors’ League (1872, and revived in 1881)
that aligned Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia. The Triple Alliance was
formed in 1882 that joined Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy into a bloc
that continued until World War I. In 1890, a bipartite agreement between Ger-
many and Russia lapsed and this ultimately led to the creation of a French-
Russian alliance over the period 1891-94. Subsequently an Entente Cordiale
between France and Great Britain was consummated in 1904, and then a
British-Russian agreement in 1907, that then bound France, Great Britain,
and Russia into the Triple Entente. While our account of these Byzantine ma-
neuvers is incomplete (see Refs. [19] for more information), and Fig. 10 does
not show all relations and thus the extent of network imbalance during the
intermediate stages, the basic point is that these relationship changes gradu-
ally led to a reorganization of the relations between European nations into a
socially balanced state. Thus while social balance is a natural outcome, it is
not necessarily a good one!

Fig. 11. Emerging conﬂicting relationships among major cultures as predicted by
Huntington in 1996. Thicker dashed lines represent stronger conﬂict. This ﬁgure is
a reproduction from the Wikipedia article on “Clash of Civilizations”, Ref. [20].

Another more immediate, and perhaps more alarming, application of social
balance is to current international relations. As popularized in Huntington’s
book [21], there appear to be developing civilizational divisions across which
increasing conﬂict is occurring (Fig. 11). According to Huntington, the division
among humankind, and the source of future conﬂict, will be predominantly
cultural rather than ideological and economic. This thesis has generated a
great deal of criticism, yet the core idea—namely, that division and conﬂict is

14

a more likely outcome rather than the Westernized world’s hope for a utopia
because of global democratization—may prove correct at least in the foresee-
able future.

We close with some potentially interesting open theoretical questions. First, it
is natural consider more general interactions. One can easily imagine ternary
relationships of friendly +, unfriendly
, or indiﬀerent 0. Another possibil-
ity is continuous-valued interaction strengths. What is the number of cliques
and number of communities as a function of network size and the density of
indiﬀerent relationships? Another direction, already considered by Davis [10],
is a more Machiavellian society in which triads with three unfriendly rela-
tions are acceptable—that is “an enemy of my enemy may still be my enemy.”
This more relaxed deﬁnition for imbalanced triads may lead to interesting dy-
namical behavior that will be worthwhile to explore. Finally, what happens if
= sji? How does one deﬁne balance
relations are not symmetric, that is, sij 6
or some other notion of social stability with asymmetric interactions?

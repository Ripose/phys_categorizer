Using a single particle density distribution for a system of self-gravitating particles which ul-
timately forms a black hole, we from a condensed matter point of view derive the Schwarzschild
radius and by including the quantum mechanical exchange energy we ﬁnd a small correction to the
Schwarzschild radius, which we designate as the skin of the black hole.

INTRODUCTION

In the evolution of a star, when the radius of a star be-
comes less than a certain limit, called the Schwarzschild
radius RSch = 2GM/c2, where M is the mass of the ob-
ject; G, Newton’s universal gravitational constant, and c,
velocity of light; neither light nor material particles can
escape from the star. Thus, one ﬁnds from above, the
Schwarzschild radius corresponds to the situation when
the escape velocity is equal to the velocity of light, a par-
ticle (or a photon) coming from a large distance when
passes near by the black hole1,2, it is not only attracted
towards it but also its orbit diverges from a straight
line.It may so happen that if the particle goes too close
to a black hole it is likely to be trapped and hence, it can-
not escape to inﬁnity. As a special case, if the particle
travels straight to the center of the black hole, it falls in-
side it and is lost forever. An interesting problem that is
associated with the formation of a black hole is the ﬁnal
collapse of a massive star. This happens when the nuclear
fuel inside the central core of the star gets exhausted. At
this stage, it is the dominance of the gravitational attrac-
tion among the particles within a star over the internal
outward pressure which makes the star to collapse. A
black hole, though may be formed from baryons, leptons
etc; the exterior observer cannot have access to the de-
tails of the inside of the black hole. The observer probes
the black hole mass M, electromagnetic charge Q and an-
gular momentum J. This is refered to as baldness of the
black hole or as Wheeler describes, a black hole has no
hair2. But actually it has only three hairs, M, Q, J. We
in this paper derive the Schwarzschild radius of a system
of gravitating particles quantum mechanically and show
that when quantum exchange correction is taken into ac-
count, there is a thin correction to this radius, which
we designate as the skin of the black hole. It has been
shown previously3 that using the quantum ﬁeld theoretic
method, by including a single-closed-loop in the self en-
ergy, a quantum correction to the classical Schwarzschild
solution of the order of ∼ G2 can be found. This comes
from the gravity sector. The correction that we ﬁnd,
comes from the exchange part of the matter-energy sec-
tor of the black hole. Our correction is also of the order
of ∼ G2.

We here consider a black hole with mass only, a
Schwarzchild1 type black hole. As described above, since
the black hole forms out of particles due to immense grav-
itational attraction, we consider the system of particles
as a many particle system that ultimately forms a black
hole. We have succeeded in developing a quantum me-
chanical approach4,5 for a system of self-gravitating par-
ticles using Newtonian gravity. We calculate the energy
content of the system including exchange interaction. In
order to calculate the total energy of a star, we choose a
trial single-particle density to account for the distribution
of particles within star. The form of our single-particle
density is such that it has a singularity at the origin. Ap-
plying it to the case of a neutron star, we not only arrive
at a compact expression for the radius of the neutron star,
but also obtain an expression for the binding energy of
the star which varies with the particle number6 as N 7/3,
where N is the particle number. Such a dependence with
N is in agreement with those of the earlier workers.6 The
aim of the present work is to give a derivation of the so-
called Schwarzschild radius even without using GTR and
relativistic quantum mechanics. By accounting for the
exchange eﬀects due to the interparticle correlations to
the total ground state energy of the system, we ﬁnd a
quantum correction to the Schwarzschild radius.

II. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

In order to describe a system of N self-gravitating par-
ticles in absence of any source for radiation, we use a
Hamiltonian of the form:

H =

N

Xi=1

i
2m

+

2

N

N

Xi=1

Xj=1,i6=j

v(| ~Xi − ~Xj|),

(1)

where v(| ~Xi − ~Xj|) = −g2/| ~Xi − ~Xj|, is the interparti-
cle interaction between pair of gravitating particles and
g2 = Gm2, m being the mass of particle and G be-
ing the universal gravitational constant. In the present
case we conﬁne ourselves to the system of neutrons only.
Since the wavefunction of a neutron star is not known,
we proceed4,5 to evaluate the total kinetic energy of the
system using a model density distribution function for

2

particles (neutrons) within the neutron star. The parti-
cles being fermions, we use the Thomas-Fermi formula for
calculating the total kinetic energy of the system. For an
inﬁnite many-fermion system, the average particle den-
sity and the fermi momentum of a particle are related to
each other as:

n =

k3
F
3π2 .

(2)

For a ﬁnite system like the star, since the density distri-
bution is a function of radius vector ~r, the fermi energy
of a particle is supposed to be dependent on r. For an
inﬁnite many-fermion system, the total kinetic energy of
the system7 is given as

< KE >inf =

to a diﬀerent value for the critical mass. Also because
if ν goes to zero (like 1/n, n → ∞), ρ(r) would tend
to the case of a constant density as found in an inﬁnite
many-fermion system. Having accepted the value ν = 1
2 ,
the parameter λ associated with ρ(r) is determined after
minimizing E(λ) =< H > with respect to λ. This is
how, we are able to ﬁnd the total energy of the system
corresponding to its lowest energy state. After evaluating
the integral shown in Eq.(4) and Eq.(6), we obtain

E(λ) =

Diﬀerentiating this with respect to λ and then equating it
with zero, we obtain the value of λ at which the minimum
occurs. This is found as:

In analogy with Eq.(3), for a ﬁnite system8, we write,

Here we are only concerned with the total kinetic energy
of the system. At λ = λ0, we have,

The total energy E of the system is given as

The total energy E of the system is found to be just

RADIUS

The expression given in Eq.(6) is written in the Hartree
approximation.
In order to ﬁnd E, we choose a trial
single-particle density of the form

We now try to calculate the average velocity of a parti-
cle within the neutron star using Eq.(12). Let us denote
it by < ~v2 >. If M denotes the total mass of the neutron
star, one writes

mined using the relation

As one can see from Eq.(7), ρ(~r) is singular at r = 0. In
general one could choose a single particle density of the
form

where ν = 1, 2, 3, 4...or 1
Integer values of ν
are not permissible because they make the normalization
constant inﬁnite. Out of the fractional values, ν = 1
2 is
found to be most appropriate, because, as we shall see
later, it gives the expected upper limit for the critical
mass of a neutron star4, beyond which black hole forma-
tion takes place. Any other value of ν would give rise

< KE >=

M < ~v2 >,

(13)

where M = N m. By comparing Eq.(13) with Eq.(12),
one obtains,

< ~v2 >= 0.030882

g4
~2 N 4/3.

(14)

From the expression for the total kinetic energy of an in-
ﬁnite many-fermion system7, one ﬁnds that the average
velocity of a particle within the system is ∼ 0.77vf , vf be-
ing the fermi velocity7 of the particle within the system,
which is maximum velocity of that particle. From this,
one clearly sees that the maximum velocity of a particle
belonging to an inﬁnite many-fermion system is greater
than the average particle velocity. In view of this fact,
we could write the maximum velocity of a particle within
a neutron star as

< ~v2 >max= α < v2 >= 0.030882α

g4
~2 N 4/3

(15)

(9)

where α is a constant whose value is to be greater than
unity and it is to be calculated later. vmax can be identi-
ﬁed as the escape velocity of a particle within a neutron
star. According to special theory of relativity, ~v2
max is to
be less than c2, c being the velocity of light. That is,

0.030882α

g4
~2 N 4/3 ≤ c2,

(16)

(17)

From this it follows that

N ≤

13.574409
α3/4

(

~c
g2 )3/2 = Nc (say),

having g2 = Gm2. Substituting Eq.(17) in Eq.(11), one
ﬁnds that,

λ0 ≥ λc =

Gm
c2 α1/4[0.8483718(
If we deﬁne the radius of a neutron star as R0 = 2λ0, we
have the expression for the critical radius as,

~c

(18)

Rc = 2λc = 2

Gm
c2 α1/4[0.8483718(

~c

(19)

Our identiﬁcation about the radius R of the star with
2λ0 is based on the use of socalled quantum mechani-
cal tunneling9 eﬀect. Classically, it is well known that a
particle has a turning point where the potential energy
becomes equal to the total energy. Since the kinetic en-
ergy and therefore the velocity are equal to zero at such
a point, the classical particle is expected to be turned
around or reﬂected by the potential barrier. From the
present theory it is seen that the turning point occurs at
a distance R = 2λ0. This is the reason why we identify
2λ0 with the radius of a star. For R > 2λ0, a particle,
belonging to the system, may have an access to the re-
gion beyond R > 2λ0, because of quantum mechanical
tunneling, but is forbidden by classical theory.

Rc as given in Eq.(19) is being identiﬁed as the so
called Schwarzschild radius which we have derived here
by treating the system as a quantum many-body system.
When R0 ≤ Rc, the corresponding neutron star becomes
a black hole. From Eq.(17), we therefore ﬁnd that the
lowest mass of the neutron star beyond which black hole
formation takes place is given as

Mc = mNc =

13.574409

α3/4 m(

~c
g2 )3/2

(20)

In order to determine α, we now try to evaluate the lim-
iting mass of a neutron star following the general expres-
sion for the radius of a star. Beyond this mass, the black
hole formation is likely to take place. For that, we con-
sider the situation when

(R0 = 2λ0) = (Rsch =

2GM
c2

),

where M = N m. From this, we arrive at

N ≥ (1.696758)(

~c
g2 )3/2 = Nc.

(21)

(22)

3

Since the expression in the right hand side of Eq.(22)
should be equal to the one given in right hand side of
Eq.(17), we must have α = 16. Under this situation, we
have

v2
max = 0.494112

g4
~2 N 4/3

c

,

(23)

where Nc = 1.696758( ~c
g2 )3/2, which, when evaluated, be-
comes 3.7390777 × 1057. For a neutron star in which the
number of neutrons exceeds Nc, it has the tendency of
forming a black hole. In that case, its mass must exceed
M = Mc = mNc = 3.12213 M⊙, M⊙ being the solar
mass.

IV. QUANTUM CORRECTION

So far we have been discussing about the quantum
mechanical derivation of the Schwarzschild radius RSch.
The very form of RSch shows that it is a classical re-
sult, leaving aside the fact the number of particles N
within a neutron star10 is to be less than Nc where
Nc = 1.70( ~c
)3/2, which involves the Planck’s constant
Gm2
n
~. Now, inorder to account for the quantum corrections
to RSch, we go beyond the Hartree contribution to the to-
tal energy of the system. That is the exchange correction
or Hartree-Fock(HF) term11 over the Hartree result (di-
rect contribution). Since the HF-correction term is non-
local we make use of the local density approximation11
to write it as,

< P E >ex=

(3π2)1/3g2

d~r[ρ(~r)]4/3.

(24)

This when evaluated gives

(25)

With the inclusion of this extra term, the expression for
E(λ), Eq.(10) is minimized with respect to λ and we
arrive at

(26)

Following the argument discussed earlier, we identify the
radius of the neutron star by R′

v′2
max ≤

max = 16 < v′2 > and using the condition that v′2

where Mc = mNc = 1.696758( ~c

sion, Eq. (28) is obtained by keeping terms upto order
( g
~c ) only in Eq. (26). For N > N ′
c, the neutron star
is likely to go over the black hole stage. From Eq.(28),
we ﬁnd that the second term within the square bracket,
forms the quantum correction to the Schwarzschild ra-
dius. As expected, it involves the gravitational ﬁne struc-
ture constant ( g
~c ). Since it is of the order 10−39, obvi-
ously it makes an extremely small correction to RSch.
It has been shown earlier3 that using the quantum ﬁeld
theoretic method and by including a single-closed-loop
in the self energy, a quantum correction to the classical
Schwarzschild solution of the order of ∼ G2 can be found.
This comes from the gravity sector. The correction that
we get is also of the order ∼ G2 but it comes from the
exchange part of the matter-energy sector of the black

V. CONCLUSION

We in this paper derive the Schwarzschild radius of
a black hole from a condensed matter point of view by
using a single particle density distribution for the many-
body self-gravitating system which ultimately forms a
black hole. By incorporating the quantum mechanical
exchange interaction, we also ﬁnd a thin correction to
the Schwarzschild radius which we designate as the skin
of the black hole.

Abstract

A relativistic quantum theory of gravity is proposed in which the gravitational
interaction between particles is represented by distance- and velocity-dependent
potentials. The Poincar´e invariance, the cluster separability, and the causality of
this approach are established. The Hamiltonian for interacting massive particles
and photons is formulated within the c−2 approximation. The classical limit of
this theory reproduces well-known relativistic gravitational eﬀects, including the
anomalous precession of the Mercury’s perihelion, the light bending by the Sun’s
gravity, the radar echo delay, the gravitational time dilation, and the red shift.

Introduction

Any realistic quantum theory of interacting particles must obey, as a minimum, the
following set of principles:

A.1 Relativistic (Poincar´e) invariance

A.2 Unitary time evolution

A.3 Cluster separability

A.4 No divergences

A.5 Causality (the eﬀect cannot occur earlier than the cause)

It is commonly accepted that these properties can be satisﬁed only in quantum ﬁeld
theories (QFT) [1]. So, in early attempts, a quantum theory of gravity was constructed
in analogy with the most successful theory of electromagnetic interactions - quantum
electrodynamics (QED). This approach, however, faced two serious diﬃculties. First, in

1

renormalized quantum ﬁeld theories, such as QED, the cancelation of inﬁnities in the S-
matrix is achieved by adding inﬁnite counterterms to the ﬁeld-theoretical Hamiltonian
H c. The coeﬃcients of these counterterms are chosen to ﬁt a set of empirical data,
e.g. the mass and the charge of the electron. However, the QFT approach to gravity
was found to be non-renormalizable. This means that the number of diﬀerent types
of counterterms is inﬁnite, so they cannot be ﬁtted to a ﬁnite number of experiments,
and the theory is not predictive. Second, single particles are not eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian H c, so this Hamiltonian cannot be used for time evolution calculations
[2, 3, 4], such as the precession of the Mercury’s perihelion.

It is less known that a theory satisfying all conditions A.1 − A.5 can be built
without reference to the concept of quantum ﬁelds [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. We will refer
to this theory as to the dressed particle approach. To describe system’s dynamics in
the dressed particle approach, it is suﬃcient to construct in the Fock space four ﬁnite
Hermitian interaction operators: the potential energy V and the vector of potential
boost Z, so that the ten generators of the Poincar´e group1

P = P0
J = J0
K = K0 + Z
H = H0 + V

(1)

satisfy commutation relations of the Poincar´e Lie algebra [1].

The potential energy V can be written as a polynomial in particle creation (α†)
and annihilation (α) operators [1]. In order to avoid ultraviolet divergences and the
need for renormalization, this polynomial should not contain certain ”bad” terms,
which are responsible for such non-physical eﬀects as the vacuum polarization and
particle self-energies [2, 3, 4, 9]. These forbidden terms have non-trivial action on
the vacuum and one-particle states. For example, trilinear interaction terms α†α†α +
α†αα, which are present in the ﬁeld-theoretical Hamiltonian of QED and other gauge
theories, are forbidden in the dressed particle approach. The allowed terms2 have at
least two creation operators and at least two annihilation operators. The number of
creation operators in each term may not match the number of annihilation operators,
so processes involving creation and annihilation of particles, e.g., radiation, can be
adequately described. However, for simplicity, in this paper, we will only discuss
processes in which the number of particles is conserved.3 We will also disregard the
possibility of n-particle gravitational potentials, where n > 2. Such a possibility does

1Here we adopted the instant form of Dirac’s dynamics and used the index ”0” to denote the
non-interacting operators of linear momentum P0, angular momentum J0, energy H0, and boost K0.

2they are also referred to as potentials
3So, we will not discuss the radiative loss of energy by inspiraling binary pulsars [10].

not have any experimental support. Then we are left with only 2-particle gravitational
interactions of the form

V ∝ α†α†αα

(2)

In the expression for V , such products of creation and annihilation operators are mul-
tiplied by numerical coeﬃcient functions and integrated over momenta of all created
and annihilated particles (see, e.g., eq. (4)). There are additional requirements on the
coeﬃcient functions that stem from the above conditions A.1 − A.4.4 The Hermiticity
of V 5 and the cluster separability (A.3) are guaranteed if the coeﬃcient functions are
real smooth functions of their arguments [1]. Moreover, these functions must rapidly
tend to zero outside the energy shell to ensure the convergence of integrals appearing
in S-matrix calculations [4]. The Poincar´e Lie algebra commutation relations (A.1)
are satisﬁed if the coeﬃcient functions are invariant with respect to Lorentz trans-
formations of their arguments [5, 6].
It is important to note that in quantum ﬁeld
theories both Hamiltonians H = H0 + V and H c yield the same S-matrix and the
same spectrum of bound state energies. So, they are related by an unitary dressing
transformation [2, 3, 4, 9].

The above conditions do not specify a unique interaction operator V , so additional
physical considerations should be used to narrow down the allowed form of interactions.
One approach is to ﬁt the Hamiltonian H to the renormalized S-matrix calculated from
the Lagrangian of general relativity [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. However, such a
ﬁtting cannot be unique, because it is well-known that there is an inﬁnite number
of Hamiltonians yielding the same S-matrix [19]. The most important requirement
is to ensure that interaction V agrees with all known experimental manifestations of
relativistic gravity. In particular,

5which is equivalent to the unitarity of the time evolution (A.2)

B.6 The gravitational time dilation

B.7 The gravitational red shift

The goal of this work is to demonstrate that all these eﬀects can be adequately
reproduced within the dressed particle Hamiltonian approach with simple two-particle
interaction terms (2). Four additional comments should be made. First, there are
no experimental indications that gravitational forces depend on particle spins. There-
fore, we will ignore the spin and helicity variables. Second, since all measured eﬀects
B.1 − B.7 are classical (non-quantum) in nature, we are especially interested in the
classical version of the theory. So, after formulation of the quantum Hamiltonian H
we will switch to the classical limit. This will be done simply by ignoring the non-
commutativity of observables, using Poisson brackets instead of quantum commutators,
and using classical Hamilton’s equations of motion instead of the quantum Heisenberg
equation. Third, all mentioned eﬀects are currently measured with the accuracy of no
better than c−2. Therefore, we will work within this approximation as well. Fourth,
even with all the above conditions satisﬁed, there could be many diﬀerent ways to
introduce relativistic corrections to the Newtonian potential (3).6 So, the particular
expressions for interparticle potentials presented in this work should be considered as
illustrative examples rather than deﬁnitive results.

In section 2 we will discuss a gravitational interaction between massive particles,
which complies with the conditions B.1 − B.3. In section 3 we will ﬁnd a two-particle
potential between massive particles and photons, which predicts properties B.4 and
B.5. In section 4 we will see that the proposed theory explains the gravitational time
dilation (B.6) and the red shift (B.7) as well. In section 5 we will discuss some con-
sequences of our ﬁndings, which concern the Lorentz transformations, the Minkowski
space-time uniﬁcation, the principle of equivalence, and the causality of the dressed
particle approach.

2 Gravitational interaction of massive particles

2.1 Hamiltonian

Consider the gravitational interaction between two kinds of spinless particles with
p and b†
masses m and M, respectively. Their creation operators will be denoted by a†
p,
respectively, and their annihilation operators will be denoted by ap and bp, where p is
the particle’s momentum. The general form of the interacting Hamiltonian is

6 For example, it is well known that the precession of elliptic orbits is a common eﬀect for a wide

range of small perturbations of the Newtonian potential [20].

According to Kita [5, 6], the interaction (4) is relativistically invariant if the coeﬃcient
function D(p, q, p′, q′) is a relativistic scalar symmetric with respect to the interchange
of the two particles7.

D(Λp, Λq, Λp′, Λq′) = D(p, q, p′, q′)
D(q, p, q′, p′) = D(p, q, p′, q′)

These conditions are satisﬁed if we choose the coeﬃcient function in the form

particles and their pseudoscalar product are denoted by

In this section we will show that this form of the gravitational interaction potential is
consistent with experimental observations B.1 − B.3.

The ﬁfth and the sixth terms are proportional to the small Planck constant ~, so they

In this paper we will deal only with one speciﬁc example of the movement of massive
interacting particles or bodies. In this example the light body m moves around the
heavy body M in a nearly circular orbit, so we can neglect the scalar product

The angular momentum vector

J ≡ [r × q]

has zero Poisson bracket with the total Hamiltonian H and therefore does not change
with time. This means that both q and r are orthogonal to the ﬁxed direction of J,
and that the orbit is conﬁned within the plane perpendicular to J. In this plane we
can introduce two mutually orthogonal unit vectors ˆr, ˆθ and polar coordinates (r, θ),
so that

This means that in the presence of gravity it takes photons extra time to travel the
same path. Let us ﬁnd the time delay for a photon traveling from the point A in ﬁg. 1

propagation delay) had rigorous theoretical formulations within our simple 2-particle
Hamiltonian theory of gravitational interactions. However, there are other prominent
eﬀects of gravity, which do not have such a clean theoretical framework. They are
the gravitational time dilation B.6 and the gravitational red shift B.7. These eﬀects
involve behavior of physical systems, which can play the role of clocks, light emitters
and light absorbers. These systems (e.g., atoms or nuclei) are governed by forces
other than gravity (e.g., the electromagnetic and nuclear forces). Therefore, their full
description requires a theory that encompasses all other interactions, in addition to
gravity. Currently, we do not have such a comprehensive theory. Nevertheless, we will
see below that a qualitative description of such systems is still possible.

4.1 Gravitational time dilation

Fundamentally, any clock is a non-stationary physical system that exhibits a periodic
process with stable frequency. In quantum mechanics, the state of any non-stationary
system is represented by a superposition of two or more stationary states. For sim-
plicity, we will assume that these states have distinct discrete energy levels Ei and Ef .
Then the rate of the clock is proportional to the energy diﬀerence Ei − Ef . For exam-
ple, the frequency ν of the electromagnetic radiation emitted in an atomic transition
is

ν =

2π
~ (Ei − Ef )

(22)

The standard deﬁnition of the unit of time is based on the frequency of radiation
produced by transitions between two hyperﬁne-split levels in Cs atoms. 9192631770
periods of the emitted electromagnetic wave make exactly one second.

The total energy E = mc2 of the clock at rest on the Earth’s surface is changed by

the addition of the gravitational potential energy (6)

E′ ≈ mc2 −

= E(1 +

GMm
R
φ
c2 )

where M is the Earth’s mass, R is the Earth’s radius, and φ = − GM
R is the value of the
gravitational potential on the Earth’s surface. As a consequence of the lowering of the
total energy, the separation between energy levels in the clock is reduced by the factor
(1 + φ/c2) as well. According to (22), this means that a clock on the Earth’s surface is
running slower (by the factor (1 + φ/c2)) than an identical clock in free space (where
the gravitational potential is zero).

This theoretical prediction was conﬁrmed in a number of experiments (see table

The rate of these clocks is intentionally preset before the launch to be 38µs/day slower
than the rate of clocks on the Earth’s surface. This oﬀset is a sum of the -7µs/day

and the gravitational correction which accumulates to 45µs per day.13 Without these
adjustments, the normal operation of GPS would not be possible.

4.2 Gravitational red shift

The setup for measuring the gravitational red shift normally consists of a source and
a detector of electromagnetic radiation (γ-rays, visible light, microwaves, etc.) placed
at points with diﬀerent gravitational potential. Assume for deﬁniteness that both the
source and the detector are in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, while the source is at a
higher gravitational potential, i.e., at higher elevation H (see ﬁg. 2). Assume further
that the photon is emitted in a transition between two energy levels Ei and Ef in the
source. So, the photon’s energy is e = Ei − Ef . When the photon gets absorbed by the
detector it disappears completely, so the same amount of energy e is transferred to the
detector independent on its gravitational potential.14 If the source and the detector
are identical physical systems located at diﬀerent gravitational potentials then, as we

13The error in the third row of Table 1 was estimated as the ratio of the nominal clock precision of

≤ 25ns and this gravitational correction.

14 Note that during the photon’s journey to the detector its kinetic energy cp varies according to
(19). However, when considering the photon’s interaction with the detector, its total energy e (which
remains unchanged) should be taken into account rather than the kinetic energy. This follows simply
from the energy conservation law. Ignoring this fact may create a confusion in the interpretation of
experimental data [26, 27, 28].

From the above discussion it is clear that the photon arriving from regions with a
higher gravitational potential only appears to be blue-shifted. This appearance is due
to the ”red shift” of the energy levels of the detector as in (23) [38]. This gravitational
red shift was observed in a number of experiments, some of which are listed in table
2. Even in most accurate measurements [39] only the leading contribution15 to the
gravitational energy has been veriﬁed. The relativistic corrections16

should play a role in the gravitational shift as well. However, these terms are very
small, and they can be observed only if the source has a large gravitational potential
or high velocity or both. In the Solar system, these conditions can be satisﬁed in a
spacecraft moving at a high speed as close as possible to the most powerful source of
gravity - the Sun. Assuming the velocity of the spacecraft v = 10 km/s, the term V3
has the relative magnitude of v2/c2 ≈ 10−9 as compared to the leading term −GMm/r.
The term V4 has the relative magnitude of GM/(c2R), which amounts to ≈ 3 · 10−8 if
M is the mass of the Sun and R is the radius of the Mercury’s orbit. These eﬀects are
at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the best accuracy achieved so far [39],
and even beyond reach of the most promising near-future technology [40].

5 Discussion

The theory presented here is capable of explaining all classical experimental manifes-
tations of relativistic gravity, and yet this theory is drastically diﬀerent from general
In this section we will discuss three characteristic properties of general
relativity.
relativity that are manifestly absent in our approach

C.2 The manifest covariance (i.e., the uniﬁed description of space and time as a

C.1 The principle of equivalence

4-dimensional space-time continuum)

C.3 The retarded character of interactions

5.1 Principle of equivalence

Within the c−2 approximation we can rewrite eq. (11) as

d2r
dt2 ≈ −

GMr
r3

(1 −

v2
2c2 )

(24)

which means that all massive bodies, independent on their mass, move with the same
acceleration in the gravitational ﬁeld. This situation is identical to the apparent be-
havior of free bodies observed from an uniformly accelerated reference frame in the
absence of gravity. Often this fact17 is generalized as the principle of equivalence,

17conﬁrmed by numerous experiments [41]

18

which constitutes the foundation of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. This prin-
ciple says that locally the gravitational ﬁeld cannot be distinguished from the uniform
acceleration by any experiment.
If this principle were true, then an observer in an
elevator could not determine whether the elevator is at rest in the ﬁeld of gravity or is
uniformly accelerating in the absence of gravity.

In our formulation, the principle of equivalence is valid for massive bodies within
the c−2 approximation (24), however, this principle does not apply to massless particles
of light - the photons. Let us calculate the acceleration of photons in the gravitational
ﬁeld. Using (21) and (20) and omitting small terms proportional to c−1 we obtain

For light rays perpendicular to the ground ((qr) = qr), the acceleration is zero. For
light rays parallel to the ground ((qr) = 0), only the ﬁrst term remains, which is
twice larger than the acceleration (24) of massive bodies in the same ﬁeld. Therefore,
contrary to the equivalence principle, the observer in the elevator can ﬁgure out what
is going on outside the cabin. To make this decision, the observer should measure the
free fall acceleration of massive bodies and light rays. If they are the same, then the
elevator is accelerating in the absence of gravity. If they are diﬀerent, then the elevator
is in a gravitational ﬁeld.

5.2 Non-universality of Lorentz transformations

Einstein’s general relativity borrows from special relativity the assumption that space
and time coordinates of any event form a 4-vector quantity. This assumption is formal-
ized in the uniﬁcation of space and time as a 4-dimensional space-time continuum. In
quantum mechanics such an uniﬁcation seems impossible. For example, in relativistic
quantum mechanics three space coordinates x, y, and z are represented by Hermitian
operators [42]. However, time is not an observable, and there is no Hermitian oper-
ator associated with time. Time is an external parameter which is attached to each
measurement according to the value shown by the laboratory clock. This fundamental
diﬀerence makes it very diﬃcult to combine quantum mechanics and the idea of curved
space-time in one comprehensive and non-contradictory approach [43, 44].

The origin of the Minkowski space-time uniﬁcation can be traced to another fun-
damental assumption of special relativity - the universality (the geometric nature)

19

of Lorentz transformations. Suppose that observer O registers an event at space-time
point (t, x, y, z) and that observer O′ moves with respect to O with velocity v = c tanh θ
along the x-axis. Then, in the case of events associated with non-interacting particles
or freely propagating light rays it is not diﬃcult to prove [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50] that the
space-time coordinates of this event from the point of view of O′ are given by Lorentz
transformation formulas

~ (K0)xθ

(25)

(26)
(27)
(28)

(29)

For example, it was shown in [4] that formulas (25) - (28) can be obtained from boost
transformations of the particle position operators

However, for interacting particles all these proofs are not valid. In such cases, one
cannot use in (29) the non-interacting boost operator K0. As we discussed in section
1, in order to comply with the Poincar´e group structure, the boost operator K must
contain the interaction term Z (see eq. (1)). The ”potential boost” operator Z has
non-trivial commutation relations with the position operators R of particles. There-
fore, in the moving reference frame O′ the formulas for the position operator R(θ) and
space-time coordinates of events (t(θ), x(θ), y(θ), z(θ)) assume complex interaction-
dependent forms that are diﬀerent from their non-interacting counterparts (29) and
(25) - (28). This means that in a rigorous quantum mechanical approach to relativistic
phenomena, the idea of the universal 4-vector transformation law of space-time coor-
dinates should be abandoned. Then the idea of a 4-dimensional space-time (either ﬂat
or curved) should not be used as well. The Hamiltonian theory of gravity developed
in this work does not assume any symmetry of space and time coordinates. Neverthe-
less, it provides a mathematically exact and non-contradictory relativistic approach to
quantum gravity.

5.3 Action-at-a-distance and causality

From general relativity it follows that the speed of propagation of gravity must be
equal to the speed of light. However, the debates regarding the instantaneous vs.
retarded propagation of gravity intensiﬁed in recent years. Van Flandern and Vigier
[51, 52] argued in favor of the faster-than-light gravity propagation speed. They based

20

their arguments on the fact that there is no gravitational aberration, i.e., the force
of gravity is directed exactly along the line connecting instantaneous positions of two
interacting bodies (9). However, it was quickly pointed out [53, 54, 55], that this fact
does not contradict the retarded propagation of gravity, if the velocity dependence
of general-relativistic interaction ”potentials” is taken into account. Fomalont and
Kopeikin [56] measured the deﬂection and delay of the light from a quasar by the
Jupiter’s gravitational ﬁeld. From these data, Kopeikin concluded [57] that the speed of
propagation of gravity is (1.06±0.21)c, in accordance with general relativity. However,
this conclusion was challenged in a number of publications [58, 59].

The theory developed in this work describes gravitational forces as action-at-a-
distance. The gravitational force acting on any particle is a function of the position
and momentum of this particle as well as of positions and momenta of all other particles
in the system at the same time instant. In other words, this means that gravitational
interactions propagate instantaneously.

Here we have a sharp contradiction with special relativity, which says that no signal
may propagate faster than the speed of light. The “proof” of this assertion goes like this
[60]. Consider an instantaneous signal18 propagating between points A and B in the
reference frame O, so that the event A may be described as the cause and the event B
is the eﬀect. Suppose that in the reference frame O these two events have space-time
coordinates (t, x, y, z)

A(O) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
B(O) = (0, R, 0, 0)

According to (25) - (28), in the moving frame of reference O′, the events A and B have
space-time coordinates

A(O′) = (0, 0, 0, 0)

B(O′) = (−

sinh θ, R cosh θ, 0, 0)

R
c

(30)

(31)

This means that the event B (the eﬀect) occurs earlier than the event A (the cause),
which contradicts the universal principle of causality, and is clearly absurd. This
observation is usually considered as the deﬁnitive proof of the retarded character of
interactions.

The explanation of this controversy was given in [4, 61]. If we are talking about
the speed of propagation of interaction between A and B, then we assume that the

18Similar arguments are applied when the signal is not instantaneous, but propagates faster than

light.

21

particles located at points A and B interact with each other. Then, as we discussed
in subsection 5.2, the Lorentz transformations formulas (30) and (31) are not valid for
the times and positions of events associated with these particles. The derivation of
correct transformation formulas should involve the knowledge of the potential boost
operator Z. Then, as was shown in [4], for the moving observer O′ the interaction
remains instantaneous just as for the observer O. The eﬀect never precedes the cause
in all frames of reference, so instantaneous potentials do not contradict causality.

6 Conclusions

Since the 1919 Eddington’s Solar eclipse expedition, the strongest argument in favor
of general relativity was its agreement with experiment and astronomical observations.
So far, this agreement could not be matched by any other theory. In this work we sug-
gested a simple relativistic Hamiltonian theory of gravity, which is capable to explain
all experimental and observational data just as well as general relativity. Moreover, in
contrast to general relativity, our theory is fully compatible with quantum mechanics.
Another attractive feature of general relativity was its beautiful mathematics based
on the assumptions of the 4-dimensional character of the space-time continuum and
the principle of general covariance. At closer inspection these principles do not have
a solid theoretical foundation. The Lorentz transformations for the time and position
of events cannot be universal and geometrical. In order to comply with the Poincar´e
group properties, these transformations should depend on interactions acting in the
observed physical system. This argument resolves the apparent contradiction between
the inﬁnite speed of propagation of gravity and the principle of causality.

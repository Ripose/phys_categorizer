two kinds of collective motions
which can eliminate the repulsion between two electrons
and let the attraction being dominant , the ﬁrst is the
lattice and electron gas, accounting for
combination of
traditional superconductivity;
the second is the electron
gas themselves, accounting for high Tc superconductivity.
In usual materials, there is a good balance between the
repulsion and attraction of an electron pair, the electrons are
regarded as free electrons so that Fermi gas theory plays very
well. But in some materials, when the repulsion dominates
electron pairs, the electron gas will has a behavior opposite to
superconductivity. In the present paper the superconducting
states are discussed in terms of relativistic quantum theory
in details, some signiﬁcant results are obtained including
quantized magnetic ﬂux, London equation, Meissner eﬀect
and Josephson eﬀect.

1 Introduction

In BCS theory, it is believed that the mechanism respon-
sible for the transition to superconductivity is a coupling
between electrons via the positive ions of metallic lattice.
The electron-lattice-electron interaction provides an at-
traction between electrons which can lead to a ground
state separated from excited states by an energy gap.
Whereas, in recent years the discovery of high Tc super-
conductivity has oﬀered a challenge for BCS theory, the
ﬁrst great diﬃcult in the extension of BCS theory is to
discover a nature of interaction responsible both for the
traditional and high Tc superconductivities.

In the present paper, we propose a mechanism for su-

2 Relativistic Coulomb’s force

This section is a theoretical preparation for the next sec-
tion.

Consider a particle moving in a inertial system with

4-vector velocity u, it satisﬁes[1]

uµuµ =

c2

−

(1)

The above equation is valid so that any force can never
change u in its magnitude but can change u in its
direction. We therefore conclude that the relativistic
Coulomb’s force on a particle always acts in the direc-
tion orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle in
the 4-dimensional space-time, rather than along the line
joining a couple of particles. Simply, any 4-vector force
f satisfy the following orthogonal relation

uµfµ = uµm

duµ
dτ

=

m

d(uµuµ)

= 0

Suppose there are two charged particle q and q′ lo-
cating at positions x and x′ in the Cartesian coordinate
system S and moving at 4-vector velocities u and u′ re-
spectively, as shown in Fig.1, where we use X to denote
x
x′. The Coulomb’s force f acting on particle q is
perpendicular (orthogonal) to the velocity direction of q,
as illustrated in Fig.1, like a centripetal force, the force
f should make an attempt to rotate itself about its path
center, the center may locate at the front or back of the
particle q′, so the force f should lie in the plane of u′ and
X, then

f = Au′ + BX

(3)

Where A and B are unknown coeﬃcients, the possibility
of this expansion was discussed in details in the paper[2],
in where the expansion is not an assumption. Using the
relation f

u, we get

f = A(u

namic subjects in details, the purpose is to establish full
conﬁdence in Eq.(10), re-given by

(22)

from which we will in this section discuss a mechanism
for superconductivity.

Obviously, for an electron pair, the ﬁrst term of Eq.(22)
can give an attraction between the two electrons in cer-
tain situations, the second term represents a repulsion
which contributes to classical Coulomb’s force. To note
that this attraction of an electron pair requires no phonon
exchange, the attraction is deﬁnitely distinguishable from
that in Cooper pair of BCS theory.

In superconductors, there are, probably at least, two
kinds of collective motions which can eliminate the repul-
sion between two electrons and let the attraction being
dominant , one is the combination of lattice and electron
gas, another is electron gas themselves.

In traditional superconductor, the transition temper-
ature are fairly low, the electron gas and lattice must
combine to depress the repulsion in electron pair, because
the isotrope eﬀect makes it clear that ions in the metal
play an essential role in superconductivity. By this view
point, we can arrive at the same consequences as BCS
theory.

In high Tc superconductor, for certain situations, the
lattice may play less-important role in eliminating the
repulsion in electron pair, the repulsion may be removed
by the electron gas itself.

In normal material without superconductivity, there
must be in balance between the repulsion and attraction
in an electron pair, so that the fermi gas theory plays
good enough for explaining metallic properties, where the
electrons can be regarded as free electrons.

In the other hand, in some material, it is possible that
the repulsion of electron pair becomes dominant, thus the
material will have opposite behavior with respect to the
superconductivity at low temperatures.

4 Quantum wave equations

No doubt, we honestly believe that Pythagoras theorem
is valid in every point in an inertial frame of reference,
this requirement is an abstract constraint on motion be-
havior of particle in the space-time.

Consider a particle displacing (dx1, dx2, dx3) in time
interval dt at speed v, Pythagoras theorem is written in
the form:

(dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2 = (vdt)2

(23)

Using the above equation, we ﬁnd

You see, indeed, the relativistic mechanics can be derived
from ancient Pythagoras theorem. For the details, please
see the paper[3]

In an electromagnetic ﬁeld, the dynamic equation
[Eq.(33)] is valid at every point in the space-time, no
mater whether there is an actual particle passing the
point considered, this means that there is a 4-vector ve-
locity u at the point regardless of whether there exists
a particle, in other words, the 4-vector velocity is the
geometric character of the point in the electromagnetic
ﬁeld, it reﬂects some requirement arisen from Pythagoras
theorem, Every 4-vector velocity at every point forms a
4-vector velocity ﬁeld u(x1, x2, x3, x4) in the space-time
( like the geometrization of gravitational ﬁeld ). The
right side of Eq.(33) is electromagnetic ﬁeld, while the
left side of Eq.(33) is 4-vector velocity ﬁeld, apple=apple,
banana=banana, ﬁeld=ﬁeld, we have

their terms, we obtain

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν )

Because the variables ∂µuν, ∂µAν, ∂ν uµ and ∂νAµ are
independent from uν, a solution satisfying Eq.(36) is

∂µ(muν + qAν) = ∂ν (muµ + qAµ)

(37)

According to Green’s formula ( or Stokes’s theorem ), the
above equation allows us to introduce a potential function

i¯h ln ψ, we obtain a
very important equation

where ψ representing wave nature may be a complex
mathematical function, its physical meanings can be de-
termined from experiments after the introduction of the
Planck’s constant ¯h.

Substituting the last equation into Eq.(29) and elim-
inating uµ, under diﬀerent approximations we can de-
rived out Klein-Gordon wave equation, Dirac wave equa-
tion and Schrodinger wave equation, for the details of the

In this section, we use Gaussian units, and use me to
denote the rest mass of electron. We limit ourself to
hydrogen atom and its spin.

In a spherical polar coordinate system (r, θ, ϕ, ict), the
nucleus of hydrogen atom provides a spherically sym-
metric potential V (r) = e/r for the electron motion.
The wave equation (40) for the hydrogen atom in energy

For a ﬁxed l (or j), m takes over 2l + 3 values, thus the

electrons.

Although the single state of m = 0, like the ground
state 3 of hydrogen atom, maybe unstable, it in a pair can
be stable because it can align its Jϕ with its counterpart
electron.

Although the shell structure of atom based on our work
is the same as the usual one, the present work predicts
that hydrogen atom has 2l + 3 degenerate states for a
ﬁxed l.

an open problem

In order to meet the ﬁne structure of hydrogen atom, we
have chosen plus sign for k in Eq.(48) and minus sign
for s in Eq.(51). In other words, there are more states
we have not discussed yet, which correspond to minus
sign for k in Eq.(48) or plus sign for s in Eq.(51). Two
situations must be considered, there probably exists an
unknown constraint forbidding the states, or experiment
has not payed attention to observe the states, this is an
open question.

6 Superconducting states

Now we return to superconducting states.
In the pre-
ceding section we have devoted into hydrogen atom and
spin subjects in details, the purpose is to establish full
conﬁdence in Eq.(38), re-given by

Where θ is an integral constant, x0 and x are the initial
point and ﬁnal point of the integral with arbitrary path
in the space-time.

Let us take the integration of Eq.(81) over a closed
path L in the space, at any instant t(dx4 = 0), the single-

Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect.

Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect Let us consider the modiﬁca-
tion of two slit experiment, as shown in Fig.5. Between
the two slits there is located a tiny solenoid S, designed
so that a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the plane of
the ﬁgure can be produced in its interior. No magnetic
ﬁeld is allowed outside the solenoid, and the walls of the
solenoid are such that no electron can penetrate to the
interior. There are two paths l1 and l2 bypassing the
solenoid from the electron gun to the screen, the wave
function ψ is given by

of two parts, the main part is repulsive, while the rest
part can be attractive in certain situations. The rela-
tivistic attraction of an electron pair provides a insight
into the mechanism of superconductivity.

In superconductor, there are, probably at least, two
kinds of collective motions which can eliminate the re-
pulsion between two electrons and let the attraction be-
ing dominant, the ﬁrst is the combination of lattice and
electron gas, accounting for traditional superconductiv-
ity; the second is the electron gas themselves, accounting
for high Tc superconductivity.

In usual materials, there is a good balance between the
repulsion and attraction of an electron pair, the electrons
are regarded as free electrons so that Fermi gas theory
plays very well. But in some materials, when the repul-
sion dominates electron pairs, the electron gas will has a
behavior opposite to superconductivity.

The superconducting states are discussed in terms of
relativistic quantum theory in the present paper, some
signiﬁcant results are obtained, including quantized mag-
netic ﬂux, London equation, Meissner eﬀect and Joseph-
son eﬀect.

7 General superconducting states

It is easy to ﬁnd that the electrons in Aharonov-Bohm
experiment can regarded as being in a superconducting
state because of lacking lattice-scattering, the similar sit-
uations like electron two split experiment etc. give us the
same inspiration. Even the elections in an atom can also
be regarded as in a superconducting state. The feeling
becomes much strong when we recognize that the two
electrons with up and down spins in an atom always form
a pair in the sell of the atom. Under the guidance of the
general superconducting states, we think that the elec-
tron pairs in atom must have the same mechanism with
Cooper pairs in superconductor. The relativistic mecha-
nism of superconductivity suggested in the present paper
just satisﬁes this requirement.

According to the theory of relativity, the relativistic
Coulomb’s force between an electron pair is composed

Trouton-Noble paradox revisited

An apparent paradox is obtained in all previous treatments of the Trouton-Noble
experiment; there is a three-dimensional (3D) torque T in an inertial frame S
in which a thin parallel-plate capacitor is moving, but there is no 3D torque
T′ in S′, the rest frame of the capacitor. Diﬀerent explanations are oﬀered for
the existence of another 3D torque, which is equal in magnitude but of oppo-
site direction giving that the total 3D torque is zero. In this paper instead of
using 3D quantities, e.g., E, B, F, L, T, .. and their “apparent” transforma-
tions we deal with 4D geometric quantities E, B, K, M , N , ... their Lorentz
transformations and equations with them. It is considered in our approach that
4D geometric quantities and not the usual 3D quantities are well-deﬁned both
theoretically and experimentally in the 4D spacetime. In analogy with the de-
composition of the electromagnetic ﬁeld F (bivector) into two 1-vectors E and
B we introduce decompositions of the torque N and the angular momentum M
(bivectors) into 1-vectors Ns, Nt and Ms, Mt respectively. The torques Ns, Nt
(the angular momentums Ms, Mt), taken together, contain the same physical
information as the bivector N (the bivector M ). It is shown that in the frame
of “ﬁducial” observers, in which the observers who measure Ns and Nt are at
rest, and in the standard basis, only the spatial components N i
t remain,
which can be associated with components of two 3D torques T and Tt. In such
treatment with 4D geometric quantities the mentioned paradox does not ap-
pear. The presented explanation is in a complete agreement with the principle
of relativity and with the Trouton-Noble experiment without the introduction
of any additional torque.

1. Introduction

In the experiment [1], see also [2], they looked for the turning motion of a charged
parallel plate capacitor suspended at rest in the frame of the earth in order to
measure the earth’s motion through the ether. In all previous treatments it is
found that in the rest frame of a thin parallel-plate capacitor, the S′ frame,
there is no three-dimensional (3D) torque T; T′ is zero in S′ since there is
only an electric force between plates. (The 3D vectors will be designated in
bold-face.) In the S frame the capacitor moves with uniform velocity u in the
positive direction of the x1 - axis. The charges on plates are now in uniform
motion producing both an electric ﬁeld E and a magnetic ﬁeld B. The existence
of the magnetic ﬁeld B in S is responsible for the existence of the 3D magnetic
force and this force provides a 3D torque on the charged capacitor. In that way

1

an apparent paradox, the Trouton-Noble paradox, is obtained and the principle
of relativity is violated; there is a 3D torque and so a time rate of change of 3D
angular momentum in one inertial frame, but no 3D angular momentum and
no 3D torque in another.

Diﬀerent explanations have been oﬀered for the existence of another 3D
torque which is equal in magnitude but of opposite direction giving that the
total 3D torque is zero in order to have the agreement with the principle of
relativity and experiments. All these previous explanations for the null result
of the experiments, see, e.g., [3-7] and references therein, mainly deal with 3D
quantities, e.g., E, B, F, L, T, their “apparent” transformations and equations
with them.

However a new explanation of the Trouton-Noble experiment, which is de-
veloped in [8], deals from the outset with 4D geometric quantities, their Lorentz
transformations (LT) and equations with them. The main point in such geo-
metric approach as in [8] is that the physical meaning, both theoretically and
experimentally, is attributed to 4D geometric quantities, and not, as usual, to
3D quantities. The consideration from [8] reveals that there is no need either
for the nonelectromagnetic forces and their additional torque, [3-6], or for the
angular electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum and its rate of change, i.e., its addi-
tional torque, [7]. Particularly the “resolution” of the Trouton-Noble paradox
from [7] is examined in more detail in [8]. There it is shown that, when r′0 = 0,
where r′0 is the temporal component of the lever arm joining the axis of rotation
with the point of application of the resultant 3D force, then the 4D torque N
(bivector) is zero not only in S′, the rest frame of a thin parallel-plate capacitor,
but in all other relatively moving inertial frames.

In this paper, sections 3-3.2, the resolution of the Trouton-Noble paradox
with the 4D torque N will be given in the case when the temporal component
of the lever arm is zero, r0 = 0, in the S frame in which the capacitor is moving.
The case r0 = 0 is not investigated in [8], but, in some sense, it corresponds to
the case investigated in [7]. Here it will be shown that the torque N as a 4D
geometric quantity is the same quantity in both frames S′ and S, in contrast
to the usual approaches, e.g., [7], in which the torque T′ in S′ is zero, T′ = 0,
while it is diﬀerent from zero in the S frame, T 6= 0.

Furthermore, section 3.1, we shall introduce the decomposition of the 4D
torque N into two 1-vectors, the “space-space” torque Ns and the “time-space”
torque Nt, which is ﬁrst presented in [9]. In the frame of “ﬁducial” observers,
in which the observers who measure Ns and Nt are at rest, and in the standard
basis, only the spatial components N i
t remain, which can be associated
with components of two 3D torques T and Tt. Note that in all usual approaches,
including [7], only the 3D torque T = r × F is mentioned and considered as the
physical one. The 4D torques Ns and Nt will be calculated for both cases,
r′0 = 0 and r0 = 0. It will be shown in section 3.3 that in the approach with
the 4D torques Ns and Nt, in the same way as in the approach with the 4D
torque N from [8], the principle of relativity is naturally satisﬁed and there is
no paradox.

s and N i

Some objections to the calculation of T in [7] are raised in section 2, while

2

the detailed comparison of our calculation of N , Ns and Nt and the usual
calculation of T is given in section 4. In section 5 the conclusions are presented.

2. The choice of the basis in the 4D spacetime and some remarks

on the calculation of the 3D torque T from [7]

The whole investigation will be done in the geometric algebra formalism, see,
e.g., [10,11]. Physical quantities will be represented by 4D geometric quanti-
ties, multivectors, that are deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., as absolute
quantities (AQs) or, when some basis has been introduced, these AQs are repre-
sented as 4D coordinate-based geometric quantities (CBGQs) comprising both
components and a basis. For simplicity and for easier understanding, only the
standard basis {γµ; 0, 1, 2, 3} of orthonormal 1-vectors, with timelike vector γ0
in the forward light cone, will be used, but remembering that the approach with
4D geometric quantities holds for any choice of basis.

It is worth noting that the standard basis {γµ} corresponds, in fact, to the
Einstein’s system of coordinates. In Einstein’s system of coordinates the stan-
dard, i.e., Einstein’s synchronization [12] of distant clocks and Cartesian space
coordinates xi are used in the chosen inertial frame. However diﬀerent systems
of coordinates of an inertial frame are allowed and they are all equivalent in the
description of physical phenomena. For example, in [13,14] and in the second
and the third paper in [15], two very diﬀerent, but physically completely equiv-
alent systems of coordinates, Einstein’s system of coordinates and the system
of coordinates with a nonstandard synchronization, the everyday (radio) (“r”)
synchronization, are exposed and exploited throughout the papers.

We shall again, as in [8], examine the situation considered in [7]. Regarding
the ﬁgures in [7] it has to be remarked that both ﬁgures would need to contain
the time axes as well. Figure 1 (ﬁgure 2) is the projection onto the hypersurface
t′ = 0 (t = 0); the distances are simultaneously determined in the S′ (S) frame.
This means that ﬁgure 1 corresponds to the choice r′0 = 0 and ﬁgure 2 to
the choice r0 = 0. The LT cannot transform the hypersurface t′ = 0 into the
hypersurface t = 0 and the distances that are simultaneously determined in the
S′ frame cannot be transformed by the LT into the distances simultaneously
determined in the S frame. Such ﬁgures could be possible for the Galilean
transformations, but for the LT they are meaningless.

The transformations for components of the 3D torque T, equations (1)-(3) in
[7], are found, e.g., in Jeﬁmenko’s book [16], equations (8-6.11)-(8-6.13). They
are

T1 = T

/c2)−1/2. In [16] these transformations are derived
where β = |u| /c, γ = (1−|u|
starting with the deﬁnition of the 3D torque T = r × F and using the LT, but
only for the spatial components ri, i.e., rx, ry, rz, and the transformations for

components of the 3D force F, equations (8.5.1)-(8.5.3) in [16]. Observe that
t = 0 is chosen to be the time of observation in S. Actually what is assumed in
that derivation from [16] is not t = 0, but that r0 = 0. Then the transformation
for the time component is r0 = γ(r′0 + βr′1) = 0, which yields r′0 = −βr′1.
That relation is used in the derivation of equations (8-6.11)-(8-6.13) in [16], i.e.,
(1). Physically r0 = 0 means that the lever arm is simultaneously determined in
the S frame in which the capacitor is moving. In the Trouton-Noble experiment
the S frame refers to the preferred frame, while the S′ frame refers to the Earth.
Hence the appropriate choice for the comparison with experiment would be that
r′0 = 0, i.e., that the lever arm is simultaneously determined in its rest frame,
the S′ frame. It is worth noting that in [7] Jeﬁmenko deals only with the 3D
quantities thus implicitly assuming that the lengths, volumes and angles are
well deﬁned in both relatively moving inertial frames, see ﬁgures 1 and 2 and,
e.g., equation (10) in [7]. Since the relations (1) are obtained for the case r0 = 0,
then the mentioned 3D quantities are well-deﬁned only in the S frame, but not
in the S′ frame. In the 4D spacetime it is not possible to have that, e.g., the
lengths, are well deﬁned in both relatively moving inertial frames.

In order to avoid such ambiguities we have calculated in [8] the 4D torque
N and showed that there is no Trouton-Noble paradox for the case r′0 = 0,
when the 4D geometric quantities are used. From the experimental point of
view the other case, r0 = 0, is diﬃcult to realize in measurements. Regardless
of that in this paper we shall investigate the case r0 = 0 as well in order to see
the fundamental diﬀerence between the usual approaches, e.g., [7] and [16], and
our approach in which the physical reality is attributed to the 4D geometric
quantities.

3. The resolution of the Trouton-Noble paradox representing

the torque by the bivector N and by the 1-vectors Ns and Nt

The discussion and the results presented in [8] and [9] strongly suggest that the
relativistically correct resolution of the Trouton-Noble paradox can be achieved
in an unambiguous way by the use of the 4D torque N , or Ns and Nt, and not
with the usual 3D torque T. This will be realized in sections 3.1-3.3.

3.1. The torques N , Ns and Nt

As shown in [8] the torque N , as a 4D AQ, is deﬁned as a bivector N =
r ∧ K, where r = xP − xO. r is 1-vector associated with the lever arm, xP
and xO are the position 1-vectors associated with the spatial point of the axis
of rotation and the spatial point of application of the force K. P and O are
the events whose position 1-vectors are xP and xO. We shal need to determine
N for the Lorentz force KL which is KL = (q/c)F · u, where u is the velocity
1-vector and F is the electromagnetic ﬁeld F (x) (bivector). This expression for
KL with F is used in [8], but in this paper the decomposition of F into electric
and magnetic ﬁelds will be employed.

4

It is proved in the tensor formalism that given an antisymmeric tensor (as
geometric quantity) F ab and a unit time-like four-vector na one can construct
two four-vectors, Ea = F abnb, and Ba = (1/2)εabcdFcdnb and, oppositely, that
F ab can be expressed in terms of these two four-vectors Ea, Ba and na as F ab =
Eanb−Ebna+εabcdBcnd, see, e.g., [17], section 6, Example 6.1 and [18], or in the
covariant form [19], equation (7.58). This decomposition of an antisymmetric
tensor is used for the decomposition of the tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
F ab in [13] [20] [14] and [21]. The same decomposition but in the Cliﬀord algebra
formalism is introduced and employed in [22-24] and [9]. The electromagnetic
ﬁeld F (bivector) is decomposed into 1-vectors of the electric ﬁeld E and the
magnetic ﬁeld B and a unit time-like 1-vector v/c as

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v,

E = (1/c)F · v, B = −(1/c

)I(F ∧ v),

2

(2)

where I is the unit pseudoscalar and v is the velocity (1-vector) of a family of
observers who measures E and B ﬁelds. It also holds that E · v = B · v = 0,
which yields that only three components of E and three components of B are
independent quantities. Observe that E and B depend not only on F but on v
as well.

Using the decomposition of F into E and B, (2), the Lorentz force KL can
be written as KL = (q/c)F · u = (q/c) [(1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v] · u, where u is the
velocity (1-vector) of a charge q, [22-24]. Particularly, from the deﬁnition of the
Lorentz force KL = (q/c)F · u and the relation E = (1/c)F · v it follows that the
Lorentz force ascribed by an observer comoving with a charge, u = v, is purely
electric KL = qE.

The 4D torque N = r ∧ KL can be represented as a 4D CBGQ. In S′, the
L −

rest frame of the capacitor, it becomes N = (1/2)N
r′ν K

ν, N ′µν = r′µK ′ν
′µ
L , where the components N ′µν are determined as N ′µν = γ′ν · (γ′µ · N ).
In [8] only the 4D torque N is considered. Here we shall introduce new 4D
torques, 1-vectors Ns and Nt. In fact, they are ﬁrst introduced in [9]. There the
same decomposition as for F , (2), is made for the 4D torque N ; it is decomposed
into two 1-vectors, the “space-space” torque Ns and the “time-space” torque Nt,
and the unit time-like 1-vector v/c as

µ ∧ γ′

µνγ′

′

N = (v/c) · (INs) + (v/c) ∧ Nt
Ns = I(N ∧ v/c), Nt = (v/c) · N,

with the condition

Ns · v = Nt · v = 0;

only three components of Ns and three components of Nt are independent since
N is antisymmetric. Here again v is the velocity (1-vector) of a family of ob-
servers who measures Ns and Nt. Similarly as for E and B the 4D torques Ns
and Nt depend not only on the bivector N but on v as well. The relations (3)
show that Ns and Nt taken together contain the same physical information as
the bivector N .

Let us take that the S′ frame is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, or the γ′

frame, in which the observers who measure 1-vectors E, B, KL, Ns and Nt are
at rest. Then in S′ the velocity v is v = cγ′

basis v has the components v′µ = (c, 0, 0, 0). Hence in the frame of “ﬁducial”
observers (5) becomes

It is seen from (6) that N ′0

s = N ′12.
s components are N ′1
N ′i
The 1-vector Ns corresponds to the 3D torque T that is considered in [7] and
[16]. On the other hand in [7] and [16], and in all other approaches that deal
with the 3D quantities, there is no 3D torque which would correspond to our
1-vector Nt. Nevertheless we shall introduce already here another 3D torque Tt,
which corresponds to our 4D torque Nt. The precise meaning of the mentioned
correspondence and of the 3D torque Tt will be better explained later.

s = N ′31 and N ′3

L , N ′2

The whole discussion with the torque can be completely repeated for the
angular momentum replacing N , Ns and Nt by M , Ms and Mt, see [9]. The
angular momentum M as a 4D AQ (bivector) and manifestly Lorentz invariant
equation connecting M and N are deﬁned as M = r ∧ p, N = dM/dτ , where p
is the proper momentum (1-vector) and τ is the proper time. The 1-vectors Ms
and Mt correspond to L and Lt respectively in the usual 3D picture. L and Lt
are introduced in [25]. The components Li of the 3D vector L (which is called
the angular momentum) are identiﬁed with the “space-space” components of
the covariant angular momentum tensor M µν, M µν = xµpν − xν pµ, and the
components Lt,i of the 3D vector Lt (for which a physical interpretation is not
given in [25]) are identiﬁed with the three “time-space” components of M µν.
(We denote Jackson’s Ki with Lt,i, K with Lt.)

In the usual picture with 3D quantities one can connect T and Tt with the

above mentioned L and Lt by the relations T = dL/dt and Tt = dLt/dt.

As shown in [8] all “space-space” components N ′ij and the “time-space”
components N ′0i are zero, N ′µν = 0, in S′ and in the case when r′0 = 0.
Accordingly, in S′, the whole bivector N is zero, N = 0, when r′0 = 0. As
already mentioned the case r′0 = 0 is the appropriate choice for the comparison
with experiment since the lever arm is simultaneously determined in S′ in which
the capacitor is at rest. The essential diﬀerence between our geometric approach
and the usual covariant picture is the presence of the basis. The existence
of the basis causes that every 4D CBGQ is invariant under the passive LT;
the components transform by the LT and the basis by the inverse LT leaving
the whole 4D CBGQ unchanged. This means that a CBGQ represents the
same physical quantity for relatively moving 4D observers. For the torque N =

6

(1/2)N ′µνγ′

ν this yields that the components transform by the LT as

N 23 = N

From (8) it is concluded in [8] that the whole 4D torque N is zero not only in
the rest frame of the capacitor but in all other relatively moving inertial frames
of reference. Thus it is proved in [8] that for r′0 = 0 the principle of relativity
is naturally satisﬁed and there is no Trouton-Noble paradox.

It is immediately seen from the deﬁnitions of Ns and Nt, (3), that they are

also zero in all relatively moving inertial frames of reference when r′0 = 0,

Again we conclude that there is no Trouton-Noble paradox.

3.2. The 4D torque N when r0 = 0

Let us now consider the case when r′0 6= 0, but r0 = 0 (r′0 = −βr′1). This case is
not investigated in [8]. As already mentioned the case r0 = 0 corresponds to that
one explored in [7] section 2 and [16]. In the S′ frame, which is again chosen to
be the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, the velocity u of the capacitor is u = cγ′
0, or
µ, where u′µ = (c, 0, 0, 0). The components r′µ are r′µ = (r′0, r′1, r′2, 0)
u = u′µγ′
where r′1 = r′
y = a′ cos Θ′, r′3 = r′
z = 0, see ﬁgure 1 in [7].
Hence in S′ v = u = cγ′
0. As already mentioned in that case the Lorentz force
is purely electric, KL = qE, where q is the total charge residing on the positive
plate. Then K ′ν
x and F ′
y
are the components of the 3D force F that are the same as in [7], but written
z = 0 and C = −σ′2A′/2ε0a′.

In the S frame N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν and the components N µν can be
determined writing N µν = rµK ν
L, or
using directly the LT for N µν , which are given by (7). Taking into account
that in S′ all N ′ij = 0 we ﬁnd that the “space-space” components N ij are
N 12 = γβN ′02 and N 13 = N 23 = 0. From the above relations we see that
the “time-space” components N 0i are the following, N 01 6= 0, N 02 6= 0 and
N 03 = 0, which yields that the whole N in S is

L and using the LT for rµ and K µ

r0 = 0, N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν = N 01γ0 ∧ γ1 + N 02γ0 ∧ γ2 + N 12γ1 ∧ γ2,

Consequently, when r0 = 0, we ﬁnd that in the S frame, in which the capacitor
is moving, the components N µν that are diﬀerent from zero are not only the
“time-space” components N 01 and N 02, but also the “space-space” component
N 12.

Of course, due to the invariance of any CBGQ under the passive LT, N from

(12) is equal to N from (11),

r0 = 0, N (11) = N (12).

(13)

This means that the principle of relativity is again naturally satisﬁed and there
is no Trouton-Noble paradox for the whole 4D torque N .

It is interesting to explore the connection between our result for the whole
4D torque N (12) and the usual result for the 3D torque T from [7]. From
(7) we know that N 12 = γN ′12 + γβN ′02 = γ[(r′1K ′2
L −
L )]. Since S′ is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers and at the same time it
r′2K ′0
is the rest frame of the capacitor, v = u = cγ′
0, one can write N 12 in terms
of the components of the 3D force F, which yields N 12 = γ(r′
x) +
γβ[(−βr′
y]. Then all “space-space” components N ij can be written in terms
of the components of the 3D torque T as

When it is taken that all N ′ij = 0 and that F ′

N 12 remains, N 12 = γ(−β2r′
y), as in (12). This component N 12 corresponds
to the component Tz, equation (4) in [7]. However, it is worth noting that in all
usual approaches, including [7], only three components of the 3D torque T are
considered to be physical. In our approach physically important, measurable,
quantity is the whole 4D torque N . When that N is written as a CBGQ then it
contains sixteen components N µν (six of them are independent) together with
the bivector basis γµ ∧ γν and equation (8) holds.

3.3. The 4D torques Ns and Nt when r0 = 0

Let us now calculate the torques Ns and Nt in the case when r0 = 0. Again
we assume that S′ is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, i.e., v = u = cγ′
0. Then,

as seen from (11), all “space-space” components N ′ij are zero. Using (5), or
s = 0 in S′. According to that the whole

Ns is zero, Ns = N ′µ

N ′i

µ = 0, when r0 = 0. From (6) it follows that N ′0

that in the S frame too N µ

explicit expression for the torque Nt as a CBGQ in the S frame we can simply

It is important to remark that the decomposition of N into Ns and Nt, equations
(3) and (4), will be fulﬁlled for both representations (15) and (17). All this
shows that the principle of relativity is again naturally satisﬁed and there is no
Trouton-Noble paradox when the theory is formulated with 4D torques Ns and
Nt.

4. Comparison with the 3D torques T and Tt

The relations (6) indicate that in the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, here the S′
frame, and in the {γ′

In the usual approaches in which components of the “physical” quantities T,
L, B and E are derived from components of the corresponding covariant quanti-
ties N µν , M µν and F µν , see [25] and for F µν [26] section 11.9, the components Ti
and Tt,i are not deﬁned by (19) than they are identiﬁed with the “space-space”
and “time-space” components respectively of the torque four-tensor N µν. Thus,
in the S′ frame, they are determined as

This is completely analogous to the way in which the components of 3D vectors
B′ and E′ are identiﬁed with the “space-space” and the “time-space” compo-
nents respectively of the covariant expression for the electromagnetic ﬁeld F ′µν ;
B′
i = F ′i0, [26] section 11.9. Obviously the components
i = (1/2c)εiklF ′lk, E′
i correspond to −B′
T ′
i. In these equations we use the notation
in which components of T′, B′ and E′ are written with lowered (generic) sub-
scripts, since they are not the spatial components of 4D quantities. This refers to
the third-rank antisymmetric ε tensor too. The super- and subscripts are used
only on components of 4D quantities. Geometric quantities in the 3D space,
B′ and E′ are also formed by the multiplication of the components B′
i and E′
i
with the unit 3D vectors i′, j′, k′. However it is important to note once again
that the covariant quantities N µν and F µν (and M µν) are only components
(numbers) that are (implicitly) determined in Einstein’s system of coordinates.
Components are frame-dependent numbers (frame-dependent because the basis
refers to a speciﬁc frame). Components tell only part of the story, while the ba-
sis contains the rest of the information about the considered physical quantity.
These facts are completely overlooked in all usual covariant approaches and in
the above identiﬁcations (20) and those for Bi, Ei Li and Lt,i.

t,i are the same as N ′i

from (19) and (15) that in the case when r0 = 0 all components T ′

that one from [7], but in [7] there are no components T ′

After this digression let us go back to the identiﬁcation (19). It is visible
i = 0 and the
i agrees with
t,i, i.e., the 3D vector T′
t.
Now comes the fundamental diﬀerence between the approaches with 3D
quantities and our approach with 4D geometric quantities. Ns and Nt as CBGQs
in the S′ frame are determined by equation (5). When S′ is the frame of “ﬁdu-
cial” observers then (5) becomes (6) and in that case the identiﬁcation (19)
is possible. In order to ﬁnd Ns and Nt as CBGQs in the S frame, in which
the capacitor is moving, we have to transform by the LT all quantities, which
ν, from S′ to S. This
determine Ns and Nt in (5) or (6), i.e., N ′µν, v′

µ and γ′

10

µ = vµγµ. Hence, in order to ﬁnd the components N µ

s and similarly for N µ
procedure yields the LT (16) for the components N µ
t .
It is important to note that “ﬁducial” observers are moving in S. Therefore
the components vµ of their velocity in S, which are obtained by the LT from
v′µ = (c, 0, 0, 0), are vµ = (γc, γβc, 0, 0). Of course, for the whole CBGQ v it
holds that v = v′µγ′
s and
in S it is not enough to transform only N ′αβ but the components v′µ as

t
well. In S, as seen from (16), the 4D torque Ns contains not only the spatial
components N i
s as well. Also it fol-
lows from (16) that the components N ′µ
s transform again to the components N µ
s
of the same 1-vector Ns. Thus, according to (15) N ′µ
s = 0 in S′, but according
to (17) N µ
s = 0 in the S frame as well. Only with such transformations, that
is, with the LT of components (16) and the unit 1-vectors γ′
µ it is obtained that
Ns = N ′µ
s γµ, and the same for Nt.

s = γβN ′1

µ = N µ

s γ′

On the other hand, in order to get the transformations for the components
Ti, (1), one has to suppose that only the components N ′αβ and not v′µ are
transformed from S′ to S. It can be interpreted as that the components v′µ =
(c, 0, 0, 0) from S′ are again transformed to the same vµ = (c, 0, 0, 0) in S. Hence
it is supposed that the same identiﬁcation as (19), or (20), is valid not only in
the S′ frame, the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, but also in the relatively moving
S frame. This yields the following transformations

T1 = T
Tt,1 = T

The transformations for Ti from (21) are completely equivalent to the transfor-
mations (1). Note that the transformations (21) are the same as the transfor-
µν (7). This is obvious since the identiﬁcations
mations for the components N
(20) say that the components of the 3D T′ and T′
t are the components of the
4D torque N and according to that they transform like the components of N ′µν .
Furthermore it is visible from (21) that the components Ti in S are expressed
k of the 3D vector T′ and the components T ′
by the mixture of components T ′
t from S′. This is the reason that the components of the
of another 3D vector T′
usual 3D torque T will not vanish in the S frame even if they vanish in the S′
frame, i.e., that there is the Trouton-Noble paradox in the usual approaches to
special relativity.

Let us now see what is with the transformations of bases. In [7] both T′
and T, as geometric quantities in the 3D space, are constructed multiplying
the components T ′
i and Ti, given by equations (1), by the unit 3D vectors
i′, j′, k′ and i, j, k respectively. The components Ti are determined by the
transformations (21), or (1), but there is no transformation which transforms
the unit 3D vectors i′, j′, k′ into the unit 3D vectors i, j, k. Hence it is not
true that the 3D vector T =T1i + T2j + T3k is obtained by the LT from the 3D
3k′. Accordingly T and T′ determined from (21), or
vector T′=T ′
′
(1), are not the same quantity for relatively moving inertial observers, T 6= T
.
Moreover, as already said, the torque T′
t is not mentioned in [7]. Completely
diﬀerent situations is with 4D geometric quantities, the torques N , Ns and

Nt, which are Lorentz invariant quantities, independent of the chosen reference
frame and the system of coordinates in it. All this together shows that although
the identiﬁcation (19) is possible in the frame of the “ﬁducial” observers, here
the S′ frame, it is not possible in any other relatively moving frame, here the S
frame.

(22)

equation (11.148) in [26], we see that the transformations for Ti and Tt,i are the
same as (22). In all previous treatments of special relativity the transformations
for the components Bk and Ek, (22), are considered to be the LT of the 3D
electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The same opinion exists in connection with the
transformations for Ti (21), i.e., (1), and the transformations for Li, equation
(11) in [25]. However in [23, 24] (Cliﬀord algebra formalism) and [21] (tensor
formalism with tensors as 4D geometric quantities) it is proved in diﬀerent
manners that the transformations for the 3D vectors E, B, (22) and equations
(11.149) in [25], are not the LT but the “apparent” transformations (AT) (for the
name see [27]), which do not refer to the same 4D quantity. (Previously I often
called these usual transformations for E and B as the standard transformations.)
From the analogy between the transformations for the components Bk and Ek,
(22), on the one hand and (21) on the other hand we can conclude that the
transformations (21) for Ti and Tt,i, i.e., (1), are also the AT. The same holds
for the transformations for Li equation (11) in [25], as explained in detail in [9].
As seen from sections 3.1 - 3.3, the 4D torques N , Ns and Nt are determined
taking that S′, the rest frame of the capacitor, is the frame of “ﬁducial” ob-
servers. In section 3 in [7], under the title “The Trouton-Noble paradox as an
electrodynamic paradox,” Jeﬁmenko calculated the 3D torque T in the S frame
using direct nonrelativistic electromagnetic calculations and not the transfor-
mations for the components Ti. The whole calculation is exclusively made with
the 3D quantities E, B, F and T. In our approach the case corresponding to
section 3 from [7], but with the 4D geometric quantities, would be that the S
frame is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers and that r0 = 0. This will not be
investigated here since the analogous case with Jackson’s paradox is examined
in detail in [9], where it is shown that there is no paradox in that case as well
and that the principle of relativity is naturally satisﬁed when the 4D geometric
quantities are used.

In section 4 in [7] an additional 3D torque is introduced, which comes from
the rate of change of the 3D angular electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum, and
which balances the rate of change of the 3D angular mechanical momentum
of the moving capacitor. It is argued in [7] that such procedure resolves the
paradox with the 3D torque.
In our approach with 4D geometric quantities
there is no paradox and consequently there is no need for any additional torque.
However it is worth noting that even in the case when the electromagnetic

12

ﬁeld is concerned one has to deal with 4D AQs and not with the usual 3D
quantities. Recently, [8], I have developed an axiomatic geometric formulation
of electromagnetism with the bivector F as the primary quantity for the whole
electromagnetism. There, [8], it is shown that the most important quantity
for the momentum and energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is the observer in-
dependent stress-energy vector T (n) (1-vector), which is a vector-valued linear
function on the tangent space at each spacetime point x describing the ﬂow of
energy-momentum through a hypersurface with normal n = n(x). From that
T (n) some new observer independent expressions (AQs) are obtained for the en-
ergy density U contained in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, for the Poynting vector S,
for the momentum density g and for the angular-momentum density M . They
are all written in terms of F . The most general expressions for T (n), U , S, g
and M , but with 1-vectors E and B and not with F , can be simply obtained
inserting the decomposition of F , (2), into the relations with F from [8]. We
consider that the 4D geometric quantities T (n), U , S, g and M have to be used
in all investigations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld instead of the usual expressions
with the 3D E and B.

5. Conclusions

The main conclusion that can be drawn from the whole consideration is that the
relativistically correct description of physical phenomena without any paradoxes
can be achieved in the consistent way with 4D geometric quantities as physical
quantities in the 4D spacetime. On the other hand, as seen from all previous
treatments of the Trouton-Noble paradox and from our extensive discussion, the
use of 3D quantities and their AT necessarily leads to diﬀerent ambiguities and
inconsistencies.

s and N µ

Regarding the measurements of the 4D geometric quantities we give the
following remark. In order to check the validity of the relation (8) (and the
similar relations for Ns and Nt), and of the physical law N = dM/dτ , the
experimentalists have to measure all six independent components of N µν (or
t ), in both frames S′
equivalently of N µ
and S. Obviously it is more complicated than in the usual approaches with the
3D quantities, in which the experimentalists measure only three components of
the 3D torque T and three components of the 3D angular momentum L in both
frames S′ and S. However, the comparisons with diﬀerent experiments that are
presented in [15] and [23, 24, 8] and in this paper explicitly show that in the 4D
spacetime the relativistically correct results refer to the 4D geometric quantities
and not, as generally accepted, to the 3D quantities.

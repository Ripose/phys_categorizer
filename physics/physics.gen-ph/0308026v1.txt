Recent experiments clearly demonstrate the importance of the excited
state 2+ at 1.8 MeV in the substruture 6He for the ground state of the nucleus
8He. It is shown here that this means that the ground state structure of 8He
rather than being α + 4n is actually 3H + 3H +2n. As such the pair of
tritons would form a compact core around which the two valence neutrons
provide a halo structure in 8He. Hence both 6He and 8He are two neutron
halo nuclei but with cores of quite diﬀerent nature. All this demonstrates
signiﬁcance of triton clustering in neutron rich nuclei.

Abstract

1

The nuclei 6He and 8He are uniquely basic for the study of light neutron
rich nuclei. While the nucleus 6He seems to have a structure α + 2n, with
the two neutrons making up a clear cut halo structure around an inert α [1],
the situation for 8He is known to be more complicated [1]. Though there
does seem to be a halo structure in 8He, however one is not clear as to the
nature of the same. Hence it is important to know as to what exactly is going
on in 8He.

In focus here would be two very recent experiments which give interesting
insights about the structure of 8He. These two very diﬀerent and indepen-
dent experimenst [2,3] reveal identity of structure for 8He. These seem to be
ruling out the standard and canonical ( but somewaht simplistic ) α + 4n
structure of 8He. Hence as such these two experiments cannot be understood
in terms of the conventional model of this nucleus. Here we shall discuss how
a recent model proposed by the author [4] is able to provide a consistent and
revealing understanding of the puzzles provided by these two experiments
[2,3].

The ﬁrst experiment [2] is that of the study of scattering of 8He on 4He
with the aim of detecting the 4n structure of 8He. There have been some
recent claims of observation of tetra-neutrons in light nuclei. This particular
study was done with the aim of understanding this putative tetra-neutronic
stucture in 8He. They start with the standard assumption that α -particles
form a well deﬁned and inert object in 8He. They considered a one step direct
4n transfer process and a two step sequential transfer process of 2n clusters
proceeding through the intermediate ground state and the ﬁrst excited 2+
state ( at 1.8 MeV) in 6He. Their DWBA calculations indicated that the
two step 2n transfer is clearly more important than the one step 4n transfer.
This expriment therefore cleary disfavours the α + 4n cluster structure of
8He [2].

In the second expermiment [3] they studied the two neutron transfer
reactions p(8He, t)6Hegs and p(8He, t)6He∗(2+) for the ground state and the
ﬁrst excited states of 6He respectively. One expects that that if the ground
state of 8He contains the subsystem 6He mainly in the 0+ state, then this
would be preferencially populated in 8He(p, t) reaction. Then it being a
second order proces, the cross section for the population of 6He∗(2+) would
be considearbly lower. Contrary to these expectations they found the cross
section of the p(8He, d)6He∗(2+) reaction to be much higher than that of
p(8He, d)6Hegs. One therefore concludes [3] that the ground state of 8He

2

contains subsystem 6He in the excited state 2+ with a large weight.

Hence what both these two experiments are showing is that 8He has a
two-tier structure with its ground state having 6He in an the excited state (
2+ at 1.8 MeV ). Therefore the structure of 8He is very diﬀerent from that
of 6He which is two loosely bound neutrons outside an inert α. But here too
though 6He is in an excited state still it is commonly believed that the α
inside it remains inert [1,3].

However this view ignores the fact that in the excited state 2+ the struc-
ture of 6He may not remain pure α + 2n but may go over to another con-
ﬁguration - that of 3H + 3H ( ie t+t ). In the past there have been several
attempts to understand the structure of 6He as consisting both of α + 2n
and of t+t cluster structures ( see [7] for references about this ). So one
may justiﬁably ask if it could be that it is the t+t structure of 6He that is
manifesting itself in this excited state relevant to 8He. And this is exactly
what my model predicts [4]. To understand as to how this is possible, ﬁrst a
few words about the model.

Recently using QCD and quark model based ideas, the author has pointed
out common threads in such diverse nuclear phenomenon as [4]: 1. The
halo phenomena is neutron rich nuclei, 2. The formation and persistence of
clusters in nuclei and 3. The nuclear molecule eﬀects. 4. The hole at the
centre of the density distribution in 3H, 3He and 4He [5,6].

It was pointed out by the author that all these require an understanding
of two or more nucleons strongly overlapping over a small local region of
size ≤ 1f m in some speciﬁc nuclei. This necessarily requires considerations
of multi-quark conﬁgurations like 6-, 9- and 12-quarks.
It was shown by
the author [4,5,6] that the nucleons do not like to go into these conﬁgura-
tions and thereby the above mentioned nuclear eﬀects are given a consistent
explanation. The reader may refer to [4,5,6] for further details.

Let us here concentrate upon a very signiﬁcant empirical prediction of
this new model. That is the eﬀect of triton clustering for neutron rich nuclei.
It was shown that as more and more neutrons are added to light nuclei there
is a marked eﬀect that an α plus two neutrons prefer to go to a conﬁguration
of two tritons. There is a continuous competition between an α cluster plus
two neutrons remaining as such versus these changing into two clusters of
tritons. For a single such conﬁguration in 6He this breakup does not happen
and to a very good approximation 6He remains an α plus two neutrons for
the ground state [1]. Also consequences like formation of nuclear molecular

3

structures [4] and also providing us with a better insight into the structure
of other A=6 nuclei like 6Li and 6Be [7]. The eﬀect of triton ( as well as α )
clustering also helps us to explain the phenomenoa of neutron halos [4] and
provides a complete and consistent description of all nuclei known to have
neutron halo structure [4,8]. It also predicts as to where to look for further
new neutron halo nuclei,

People have always thought that for stable N=Z nuclei with 4n the alphas
give a good cluster structure because of the high value of binding energy of
this particular nucleus. But the author pointed out [4] that other properties
which are signiﬁcant in this respect are the extremely high surface density of
α and also that it has a hole at the centre. What the other A=3 nuclei, 3He
and 3H have in common with α are having holes in the centre and having
very high densities on the surface - much higher than any other nuclei [4,5,6].
It is these two properties which all these three light nuclei ( A=4 and A=3
) have in commom which makes them ideal candidates around which cluster
structures may develop [4]. This is the reason why the tritons are showing
up so prominently in forming clusters in neutron rich nuclei. Also for the
same reason 3He would play a similar role in proton rich nuclei [4].

This tendency for neutron rich nuclei to form tritons was used by the
author [4] to predict that 9Li can be treated as made up of 3t and therby
forming a more compact nucleus. Thus when one goes to 11Li one has two
loosely bound neutrons forming a loose halo around a compact core of 9Li.
However for 6He the core α remains inert and it is the two valence neutrons
which form the halo. But when one adds two more neutrons around 6He
to form 8He then for the ground state of this nucleus there is a distinct
change in the substructure of 6He as discussed above. As per our model
discussed here, The excited 2+ state of it can be imagined to have gone into
the predominant t+t conﬁguration. This forms a very compact structure
as its two constituent, the tritons themselves are so compact. Therefore it
would have high surface densities and thereby preventing the two valence
neutrons around it ( for 8He ) from going through and thus forming a halo
around it. Hence as per our model 8He is also a two neutron halo nucleus
with a compact core of two tritons.

In trying to understand the surprisingly large branching ratio for beta-
delayed triton emission in 8He, the authors of ref. [9] suggeted the existence
of a new 1+ state at 9.3 MeV in 8Li. They did not know the origin of this
state though. Quite clearly in our model here this is the state built up on

4

the 1+ state at 5.65 MeV in 6Li ( see [7] for deatils ). For our purpose here
just note that this excited 1+ state in 8Li has the cluster structure (α-t-n)
[7]. Therefore tritons would be easily emitted in this branch of beta decay
in 8He whose structure as shown here is t+t+2n. The beta transition would
connect these two structures in a naturally simple manner.

In summary, two recent experimental results are used here to give a new
understanding of the structure of the nucleus 8He. Author’s recent model,
which has been successfully applied to provide a comprehensive perspective
of several diverse nuclear phenomena, again with the insights obtained from
these new experiments provides a new description of 8He. It is predicted to
have a structure of t+t+2n. Here the two tritons form a compact core ( as
an excited state of 6He ) around which the two valence neutrons form a loose
halo.

Reference spaces in Special Relativity Theory:
an intrinsic approach

Nilo C. Bobillo–Ares∗

Abstract

Starting from a suggestion of Einstein on the construction of the
concept of space, we elaborate an intrinsic method to obtain space and
time transformations between two inertial spaces of reference, mathe-
matically modeled as aﬃne euclidean spaces. The principal device in-
troduced for relating the space readings in both spaces is the so-called
tracer mapping, which makes a snapshot of a space onto the other. The
general form of the space and time transformations is obtained as an
aﬃne–preserving mapping compatible with the principle of relativity,
a cylindrical symmetry around the relative velocities between spaces
and the group character of the transformations. After having obtained
Galileo and Lorentz transformations, the same method has been applied
to two classical problems: the Coriolis theorem of Newtonian Mechan-
ics and the geometry of a rotating disk in Special Relativity. Even in
the case of Newtonian Mechanics, the possibility of distinguishing the
spaces of reference is found useful.

Key words : Concept of Space, Space and Time Transformations, Reference Frames.

1 Introduction

The nature of motion is an important issue since the ﬁrst stages in the science
of mechanics. As it happened with many other topics, Galileo was one of the
ﬁrst to deal with this problem in an inquiring form. In his celebrated treatise
Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems Ptolemaic and Copernican,
Galilei (1632), he faced the problem of the relativity of the motion and argued
that one may refer a motion not only to the resting Earth but also to other
bodies moving with respect to it. Gradually, it was becoming clear that, for
studying a motion, use had to be made only of the space relative to a body of
reference, making thus needless even to mention an absolute space. In spite of
this knowledge being so old, its operational meaning was not fully understood
until Einstein’s ﬁndings on General Relativity. In his book The Meaning of
Relativity, Einstein (1953), he set out clearly his ideas on the relativity of the
space:

“For the concept of space the following seems essential. We can
form new bodies by bringing bodies B, C, ... up to body A; we
say that we continue body A. We can continue body A in such
a way that it comes into contact with any other body, X. The
ensemble of all continuations of body A we can designate as the
‘space of the body A.’ Then it is true that all bodies are in the
‘space of the (arbitrarily chosen) body A.’ In this sense we cannot
speak of space in the abstract, but only of the ‘space belonging to a
body A.’ The earth’s crust plays such a dominant role in our daily
life in judging the relative positions of bodies that it has led to an
abstract conception of space which certainly cannot be defended.
In order to free ourselves from this fatal error we shall speak only
of ‘bodies of reference,’ or ‘space of reference.’ ”

According to Einstein, the space of a body is a physical concept and, as such,
operationally deﬁned. He emphasized several features of it:

1. Any body may be used as a reference body. In special relativity we will

limit ourselves to inertial bodies.

2. The points of a reference space have a permanent character to the extent
that they can be conceived as particles of some continuation of the body.
The points of a space of reference are by deﬁnition at rest.

2

3. In a given space of reference, the record of the position of a moving
particle is the point of that body which coincides with it at the considered
time instant. There are no moving points but moving particles passing
by close points in a space of reference, instead.

The fact that the space is relative in no way means that this concept is
irrelevant in physics. Energy or electric ﬁeld are also relative concepts but
however we do not dismiss them out as of lacking interest. Even though this is
clear enough, after the Minkowskian geometric interpretation of spacetime the
use of particular bodies of reference has been scorned as an old pre–relativistic
prejudice similar to absolute time or instantaneous action at a distance. Never-
theless, to experimentally support a physical theory, it has usually to recourse
to data obtained in a certain laboratory space. Therefore, it seems to be of
the utmost interest to explicit the usage rules for spaces of reference in the
realm of special relativity.

Besides the customary method based upon the use of coordinates, the study
of spacetime can be undertaken in an axiomatic mathematically rigorous way
in which it is considered as an aﬃne pseudoeuclidean space. Matolcsi (1993)
has promoted such a procedure in order to build up an intrinsic formalism upon
which any physical theory can be erected. Our viewpoint is complementary:
we are concerned with the construction of spacetime from the analysis of the
transformations between inertial reference spaces.
Thus, the objectives this work is aimed to are:

1. To cast in mathematical form the idea of space of reference devised by

Einstein.

2. Since the geometrical and physical relations on each body of reference
do not depend on the chosen coordinate system, we will develop an
intrinsic method, directly based on absolute objects of the Euclidean
aﬃne tridimensional space. The relativity of space demands to consider
a diﬀerent aﬃne space associated to each body.

3. To present a theoretical device, that we call tracer mapping, having
a direct physical interpretation, suited to characterize the relationship
between the physical quantities measured in diﬀerent spaces, without
coordinates. The concept of tracer is not new, but we think it has not
received the attention it deserves. For instance, Synge (1972) introduced
the term snapshot, taken from Milne’s world–map, a term used in the
same sense by Rindler (1977).

3

4. To obtain ab initio intrinsic expressions of the Galileo and Lorentz trans-

formations.

The proposed method allows to wholly solve, or avoid, some little problems
appearing in the usual derivations of space and time transformations, which
are really associated to a particular choice of a coordinate system in each
reference body. For instance we could list: the problem of parallelism between
coordinate axes, addressed in Frahm (1979); the reciprocity relation for the
relative motion of two inertial frames of reference, analysed in detail in Berzi et
al. (1968); and the search for Lorentz transformations in cases with arbitrarily
oriented axes, carefully studied in Cushing (1967).

In order to state clearly the components used in the construction of the
space and time transformations, we have resorted to a style akin to the “more
geometrico”. However, this work is not addressed to a search for a minimum set
of postulates necessary for a logically closed derivation [for that purpose see, for
example, Matolcsi (1993), L´evy–Leblond (1976), Nishikawa (1997), Schwartz
(1984) and References cited therein]. Instead, the intention of this work is of
a methodological nature. We try to clarify as far as possible the ingredients
of physical character which arise on occasion of the analysis of the problems
concerning the description of the measurements in space and time carried out
by several observers and the comparison between these measurements.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, using the tracer mapping
concept, the intrinsic method is introduced. By adding further physical hy-
potheses, we obtain in Sections 3 and 4 the transformations of Galileo and
Lorentz. Next Section is devoted to widen the scope of the intrinsic method
by giving an coordinate-free deﬁnition of angular velocity leading to Coriolis
theorem, within the limits of Newtonian mechanics, and a characterization of
the geometry on a rotating disk, in special relativity.

2 The intrinsic method

Spaces, times and events

According to Einstein’s construction, to every body A there corresponds a
space of reference K. Besides, if the body is an inertial one, its space is
aﬃne and euclidean. At every point, the spaces are equipped with identical
measuring rods, i. e., rods made by using the same instructions, which deﬁne
the same length unit in all of them.

4

From now on, the word “space” as used in this paper will mean the space
of reference of a body. In that sense, a space has an objective character and
its points are permanent as they can be considered as particles of a certain
body.

Unless otherwise stated, only inertial bodies and spaces of reference will
be considered. For any of these spaces of reference, such as K, being an aﬃne
space, the set of its translations (pairs of points) forms a vector space called
(1986), Chap.
V
1, we will represent a translation of the point Q by the vector v as a new point
P given by the sum Q + v.

. Following deﬁnitions and notation given in Crampin et al.

On each space of reference identical clocks, which deﬁne the same time
measuring unit in them, are distributed. If the space is inertial, these clocks
can be synchronized once and for all.

Postulate 1 Each event
happens in the neighborhood of a single point P
of the space K. The clock at P registers its date, t, a single real number. The
record (t, P ) fully characterizes the event.

P

is recorded in the space K ′ of other body
In a similar way, the same event
as (t′, P ′). Two diﬀerent records in K represent two diﬀerent events that will
produce also diﬀerent records in any other space. This circumstance confers
the event manifold an absolute character.

P

It is to be emphasized that (t, P ) is a very primitive way to register an
event. This record consists of a point and a real number rather than four
coordinates.

Particles, trajectories and velocities

called the trajectory of M, a curve in K.

The study of the space and time transformations following Einstein’s guidelines
can be undertaken by using the theoretical devices introduced below.

The suitability of this deﬁnition of Λt as a bijective mapping will be evident
upon its explicit construction. We call trace at t of the point set Ω′
K ′ on
the space K to the set Ω = Λt(Ω′). The trace, being a set of points in K, has
a permanent character and it could be envisaged as a contact photograph of
the space K ′. Also, note that, in order to get the trace, no time consideration
in K ′ has to be made.

The pair of relations

t′ = f ′(t, P ).

P = Λt(P ′),
t′ = f ′(t, P ),

(cid:26)

will be called mixed space and time transformation formulas (note the prime
on those mappings with image on K ′). They suﬃce for relating the records of
any event in the spaces K and K ′. The mixed formulas are equivalent to the
standard ones, in which (t′, P ′) is obtained from (t, P ). In fact, since Λt has an
inverse, call it (Λt)−1, the ﬁrst of the Equations (3) leads to P ′ = (Λt)−1 (P )
which, together with t′ = f ′(t, P ), constitutes the formulas for the standard
transformation. As we will see, the form (3) will prove to be very suitable
for our intrinsic derivation. Moreover, it will be seen how certain symmetry
considerations are all we need to carry them to their ﬁnal form.

From the invertibility of the mappings Λt and f ′

P , stated in their respective
deﬁnitions, it follows that the mixed transformation formulas as a whole are
also invertible. In fact, if (Λt)−1 and (f ′

P )−1 do exist, then

which can be identiﬁed with the expression representing the trace of K on K ′
at the time t′, P ′ = Λ′
t′(P ), i. e., with the ﬁrst of the equations of the inverse
mixed transformation. Resorting in advance to the principle of relativity, the
spaces K and K ′ are on equal terms and, therefore, in the same way as Λt,
the tracer mapping Λ′
t′ must also be invertible, so that

By substitution of this expression for P in the second of the equations (4), we
obtain

P = (Λ′

which can be identiﬁed with the second of the equations for the inverse mixed
transformation, t = fP ′(t′).

Since the standard transformation formulas can be derived from the mixed,
the invertibility of the latter implies that of the former, as it was to be expected.

Spatial homogeneity of the transformation

As previously stated, the inertial character of K and K ′ implies that both
spaces are homogeneous and isotropic. On the other hand, the transforma-
tion among spaces and times itself may not depend on the considered point.
This property, which we will call spatial homogeneity of the transformation,
is expressed as it follows:

Postulate 2 The mappings Λt and f ′ are homogeneous in their spaces, i. e.,
they do not privilege any of their points.

Consider ﬁrst the mapping Λt. Since K ′ is aﬃne, we have the obvious identity

Λt(Q′)Λt(Q′ + r′),
Λt(Q′ + r′) = Λt(Q′) + −−−−−−−−−−−−→

(8)

where the vector −−−−−−−−−−−−→
written as λt(Q′, r′). But Postulate 2 means that a vector r′

Λt(Q′)Λt(Q′ + r′), being a function of t, Q′ and r′, will be
′ placed

∈ V

7

at two diﬀerent points of K ′ must map into the same vector in
. Thus,
λt(Q′, r′) = λt(R′, r′), for any pair of points Q′ and R′, and so the argument
Q′ in λt can be suppressed. Instead of Eq. (8) we have, then,

V

Λt(Q′ + r′) = Λt(Q′) + λt(r′).

(9)

Now, we can show that λt is a linear mapping because of K ′ being an aﬃne
space. In fact, consider two successive translations in K ′, r′ and s′, for which
(Q′ + r′) + s′ = Q′ + (r′ + s′), and

Λt [Q′ + (r′ + s′)] = Λt(Q′) + λt(r′ + s′)
= Λt [(Q′ + r′) + s′] = Λt(Q′ + r′) + λt(s′)

= Λt(Q′) + λt(r′) + λt(s′).

Thus, λt(r′ + s′) = λt(r′) + λt(s′). Starting with identities like

λt(2r′) = λt(r′ + r′) = λt(r′) + λt(r′) = 2λt(r′),

it is easily shown, for an m being successively integer, rational and real, that
λt(mr′) = mλt(r′), thus ﬁnishing the proof.

With respect to f ′, we can follow a similar line of reasoning. In the obvious

identity

f ′(t, Q + r) = f ′(t, Q) + [f ′(t, Q + r)

f ′(t, Q)] = f ′(t, Q) + θ′

t(Q, r),

−

the assumed spatial homogeneity in f ′ implies that θ′
dent on the particular point Q, then

t(Q, r) must be indepen-

f ′(t, Q + r) = f ′(t, Q) + θ′

t(r).

(10)

By combining two translations in K we can show that θ′

t(r) is linear. In fact,

f ′ [t, (Q + r) + s] = f ′(t, Q + r) + θ′

t(s) = f ′(t, Q) + θ′

t(r) + θ′

f ′ [t, Q + (r + s)] = f ′(t, Q) + θ′

t(r + s)
t(s),

t(r + s) = θ′

hence θ′
mθ′
t(r).
The same reasoning can now be used with the other argument in f ′. In

t(s). And, ﬁnally, as in the case of λt, θ′

t(r) + θ′

t(mr) =

the identity

f ′(t + τ, Q) = f ′(t, Q) + [f ′(t + τ, Q)

f ′(t, Q)] ,

−

8

the term between square brackets, in principle a function of t, τ and Q, actually
cannot depend on Q according to the postulated homogeneity of f ′, therefore

f ′(t + τ, Q) = f ′(t, Q) + g′(t, τ ),

where g′(t, τ ) depends on t and linearly on τ , i. e., g′(t, τ ) = γ′(t)τ . This
last statement can be shown by considering the composition of two arbitrary
translations in time. We get the relation

f ′(t + τ, Q + r) = f ′(t, Q) + γ′(t)τ + θ′

t(r).

(11)

Time homogeneity of the transformation

In a similar way as in the last Subsection, the transformation between spaces
of reference may not depend on a particular chosen time. This property, that
we will call time homogeneity of the transformation, is expressed as it follows:

Postulate 3 The mappings Λt and f ′ are homogeneous in time, i. e., they
do not privilege any time instant.

An arbitrary point P ′ of K ′ describes in K the trajectory Λt(P ′). The ho-
mogeneity in time of the mapping Λt implies that such a motion is uniform,
i.e.,

Λt(P ′) = Λ0(P ′) + u(P ′)t.

Here, u(P ′) is the velocity ﬁeld linked to the particles in K ′, the material
velocity, in the language of the Kinematics of Continuous Media, see Marsden
et al.
(1994), p. 26. We may express this ﬁeld also in terms of the points of
K (usually called spatial velocity, see Marsden et al. (1994), p. 27):

U(t, P ) = u

(Λt)−1 (P )

.

(cid:2)
Since time is homogeneous for the transformation, K must observe a steady
situation in any point and, thus, the space velocity ﬁeld must be time inde-
pendent:

(cid:3)

(12)

(13)

(14)

∂U
∂t

= 0.

9

This condition can only be satisﬁed if u(P ′) is the same for every point P ′.
It is worth noting that the relative motion between K and K ′ establishes a
relationship between the homogeneities in time and in space K ′.

By diﬀerentiating (9) with respect to time we obtain the relation

u(Q′ + r′) = u(Q′) +

(r′).

dλt
dt

If, as seen, every point of K ′, in particular Q′ and Q′ + r′, have the same
velocity, the following relation will hold

dλt
dt

= 0,

that is, λt must be time independent and, thus, it can be represented simply
as λ.

Two simultaneous events at Q and Q + r happen in K ′ with a time sepa-

ration that, according to Eq. (10), is given by

Time homogeneity in f ′ requires that the above separation does not depend
on the chosen instant, t. Therefore, the index in θ′

t is not necessary, so that

f ′(t, Q + r)

f ′(t, Q) = θ′

t(r).

−

f ′(t, Q + r) = f ′(t, Q) + θ′(r).

On the other hand, for two events happening in the same point, Q, with a
time separation, τ , we have, from Eq. (11),

f ′(t + τ, Q)

f ′(t, Q) = γ′(t)τ.

−

In the same way, the condition for time homogeneity leads to γ′ to be indepen-
dent of t. The results concerning the last two Postulates can be summarized
in the following theorem:

Theorem 1 The homogeneities in space and time of the mappings Λt and f ′
imply

Λt(Q′ + r′) = Λ0(Q′) + ut + λ(r′)
f ′(t + τ, Q + r) = f ′(t, Q) + γ′τ + θ′(r),

where u is the velocity of any particle in K ′ as measured in K, λ is a linear
, γ′ is a number and θ′ is a covector in
mapping of

′ on

In order to take advantage of the aﬃne property of the spaces we ﬁnd useful to
use vectors to represent points, which is carried out by choosing a point and an
instant as an origin in each space and time. This process can be independently
made in each space but the theory becomes simpler if one chooses a single,
as a reference or origin. This event registers at K

The choice of a reference event is the ﬁrst step to coordinate the space and
time records in both spaces of reference.

An arbitrary event,

at K and K ′, respectively. Hence, we can write

Then, by using Eqs. (20) and (21), the mixed transformation formulas (3) can
be written in terms of vector quantities as

Some consequences of the principle of relativity

The inverse transformation formulas,

are merely those obtained by exchanging K and K ′. According to the principle
of relativity, both spaces of reference are physically equivalent. Therefore we
are allowed to repeat the previous analysis but now from the point of view of
K ′. Thus, we arrive to the vector relations, similar to (24) and (25),

This statement presupposes that identical length and time measuring stan-
dards have been adopted in both spaces, and it derives, then, from the principle
of relativity. We can make this connection plausible by means of conceptual
experiments like the following ones. In relation to Eq. (37), consider the mea-
surement of the period of a standard clock, like a neutron lifetime, at rest
in the origin of K. Let ∆τ0 and ∆τ ′ be the values obtained at K and K ′,
respectively. Then, according to Eq. (25), ∆τ ′ = γ′∆τ0. For the standard
clock now at rest in K ′ one would obtain similarly ∆τ = γ∆τ ′
0, where ∆τ ′
0
and ∆τ are the measured period in K ′ and K, respectively. The equivalence
between K and K ′, implicit in the principle of relativity, implies (37); if not,
a strange asymmetry between K and K ′ would appear possibly reminiscent

of an ether at rest, and both spaces could be distinguished from one another
(see Nishikawa (1997) for a critical analysis of these assumptions and their
relationship to the principle of relativity). Besides, if the times in both spaces
ﬂow in the same direction, all the time intervals considered so far are positive,
and γ > 0. A similar argument involving the motion of the origins of both
spaces can be used to justify Eq. (38).

Cylindrical symmetry of the transformation problem

Postulate 5 In the transformation problem, at K, the direction U of u is
privileged. All directions in the plane (subspace) T of vectors perpendicular to
u are physically equivalent. In the same way, at K ′, the direction U ′ of u′ is
privileged and all directions in the plane T ′ of vectors perpendicular to u′ are
also physically equivalent.

Proof to Equation (39): Given any vector p1 in the plane T we can add two
more vectors in it, p2 and p3, to form an equilateral triangle and such that
p1 = p2 −
Since the magnitude of the three vectors is the same, the action of θ′ on any
of them must be identical, i. e.,

(40)

p3.

θ′ (p1) = θ′ (p2) = θ′ (p3) = C.
Applying θ′ on both sides of Equation (40) and on account of its linearity, we
conclude that C = 0, that is, the action of θ′ on any vector perpendicular to
u is zero. This result allows us to fully characterize θ′. In fact, let rT and rU
be the projections of a vector r, r
, on the plane T and on the direction of
u/u)(u/u) and θ′ (rT ) = 0, then θ′ (r) = θ′ (rU ),

Equation (41) follows directly from Equation (29) and the result (37). The
other ones can be shown from the cylindrical symmetry of the transformation
and the principle of relativity, following a similar reasoning to the used to
prove Theorem 3.

T 2 ∈

Equation (43) shows that λT preserves the magnitude of those vectors
perpendicular to u′ when transformed from T ′ to T . As it is well known, a
single parameter, usually an angle, is enough to determine this transformation.
The value of this angle is so far undeﬁned since we have not speciﬁed the
orientation of K ′ with respect to K. Once the origins in spaces and times and
the directions of the velocities u and u′ have been established, the space K ′
can be rotated around u′ without any change in the previous results. From
this consideration, it follows that no better determination of λ can be obtained
unless that missing piece of information is added.

Finally, in order to fully characterize the mappings θ′ and λU we have
to ﬁnd out a relation between γ and u. To that aim, we will extend the
method developed for one-dimensional spaces in L´evy–Leblond (1976) and
accordingly we will assume that the space and time transformations have a
group structure. That group structure was already explored in part when we
assumed the existence of an inverse transformation.

Closure of composition of transformations

Let K1, K2 and K3 be three inertial spaces of reference. Between each pair
of them a space and time transformation can be established: T a between K1
and K2, T b between K2 and K3, and T c between K3 and K1. We assume, as
before, that a single event deﬁnes origins in the three spaces and times. Each
transformation is characterized by a relative velocity that can be measured in
any of the two spaces related by the transformation. Thus, T a is characterized
by ua
2 in K1 and K2, respectively. Let (τ1, r1) and (τ2, r2) be records
of the same event at K1 and K2, respectively. Our previous analysis [refer to
Eqs. (24), (25), (37), (39) and (41), and to Deﬁnition 4] allows us to write the
equations of the mixed transformation between those spaces as

The formulas for the other two transformations can be immediately deduced
from the preceding ones by changing on them the indices a, for the transfor-
mation, and the related pair 1–2, for the linked spaces, to the ones desired.

This set of equations will permit us to ﬁnd an universal form for the relation
between the parameter γ and the relative velocity for any transformation as
well as formulas relating the relative velocities of the three transformations.
For that purposes it is easier to study the motion of the origin of each space

15

from the other two spaces together with the transformation linking the last
ones. According to the equations deﬁning the transformation T c, the events
experienced by the chosen origin of K3, r3 = 0, appear in K1 as

In the same way, r3 = 0 appears in K2 as

events registered in K1 and K2 are related by the equations of the transfor-
mation T a given above. By substitution of Eqs. (48)–(51) into Eq. (44) we
get a relation among relative velocities:

Summary of space and time transformations

For later use we collect here the results obtained in this Section. The mixed
transformation formulas between K and K ′, transcribed with an obvious
change in notation from Eqs. (44) and (45), where the expression for γ(u)
given in Eq. (57) is used, take the general form:

where v = dr/dτ and v′ = dr′/dτ ′ are the measured velocities of a particle in
K and K ′, respectively.

These equations, together with the method used for obtaining them, exhibit

certain formal aspects which are worth to be emphasized.

1. Only intrinsic objects belonging to each space are used.

2. The mathematical formalism keeps each object separate in its own space.
Thus, in Equation (62) a vector of K is written as the sum of two vectors
of the same space, and a numerical coeﬃcient is obtained as the dot
product of two vectors of the other space.

3 Galilean transformation. Absolute space

If one takes α = 0 then, irrespective of the value of the relative velocity, γ = 1.
Hence, from Eq. (59), the formula for time transformation is, simply,

τ = τ ′,

showing that the time elapsed between two events is he same in any space
of reference. That is the old concept of absolute time, implicit in Newton’s
Mechanics. The transformation formula for position is, from Eq. (58),

which, together with Equation (63), are the Galilean transformation formulas
between the spaces K and K ′. The classical law for velocity addition can now
readily obtained from Equation (62), with γ = 1, as

i. e., λ(r′)

vectors in
can be established which makes possible to identify both spaces at any time

−
T ′ on λ(p′).

In this way, any point of K ′ is identiﬁed with its trace in K. The idea of
an absolute space, as deﬁned in Desloge (1982), comes from the possibility
of this identiﬁcation. We should point out that this identiﬁcation is possible
at any speed, even at relative rest. This is the reason why ﬁgures showing
two frames of reference in relative motion seem so obvious:
in spite of the
inherent limitations of a still picture forcing us to draw not only K but also
K ′ at rest, such identiﬁcation is always allowed. On the other hand, since this
identiﬁcation is not possible in the spacetime of Minkowski when K ′ is moving,
such simple ﬁgures cannot properly be drawn, situation that we discuss in the
following Section.

We may fuse K and K ′ into one space by setting r′

λ(r′) and

≡

≡

λ(u′)

and obtain the well known transformation formula

r = τ u + r′.

(66)

This classical result entails a trap very diﬃcult to escape from. The Galilean
transformation formula (66), an innocent vector addition, seems to be a di-
rect consequence of the aﬃne character of the (absolute) space. When it was
shown that this was not an accurate physical law it resulted rather natural
to doubt the aﬃne property of the space by introducing an spatial anisotropy
along the motion of the body of reference. That idea was formulated as the
FitzGerald contraction hypothesis. If, on the contrary, we keep the separation
between spaces and write the Galilean transformation as Equation (64), con-
sequence of an absolute time, the jump to special relativity is easier since there
is more room to look for a solution elsewhere. Einstein solved the diﬃculty by
questioning the absolute character of time in his celebrated 1905 paper.

4 Lorentz transformation

By choosing a suitable negative value for α one arrives to Lorentz transfor-
1/c2, where c is the
mation. Experimentally, one ﬁnds that, actually, α =
speed of light in a vacuum. Accordingly, the actual dependence of γ on u is

−

The formulas for the mixed Lorentz transformations are Eqs. (58) and (59)
with this value for γ, i. e.,

The inverse transformation formulas are readily obtained by exchanging primed
and unprimed symbols in the later expressions. From these equations we get

Now, from Equation (68), it can be seen that

showing that λ is not an isometric mapping. This fact has the important
consequence for the spaces K and K ′ that they cannot be identiﬁed to each
other. Therefore, ﬁgures mixing two spaces, even if one-dimensional, are im-
possible, and only ﬁgures in spacetime can be drawn if one insists in showing
both spaces on them.

5 Extending the method to two classical prob-

lems

The intrinsic method based on the concept of tracer mapping may be used
in more general situations. As examples of that we have chosen two classical
problems, the analysis of which is, in our opinion, more transparent when the
proposed method is used.

5.a

Intrinsic deﬁnition of angular velocity

In Newtonian Mechanics, the spaces of two inertial bodies of reference, K and
K ′, may be metrically identiﬁed since the mapping λ preserves the magnitude
of vectors. This is true independently of the relative velocity between the
bodies. This fact makes possible to study the transformations between two
spaces of reference having arbitrary motions. As before, Λt : K ′
K is the
tracer mapping of K ′ on K.

→

Postulate In Newtonian mechanics, the tracer mapping Λt between two spaces
K and K ′, having arbitrary relative motion, is aﬃne and isometric.

We take as origins the arbitrary points Q of K and Q′ of K ′. As before, we
write the condition for the mapping Λt to be aﬃne, at any time, as

Λt(P ′) = Λt

Q′ + −−→Q′P ′

= Λt(Q′) + λt

−−→Q′P ′
(cid:17)

,

(cid:17)
but now we cannot take λt as time independent since diﬀerent points of K ′
have diﬀerent velocities. Equation (73) in vector form is

(cid:16)

(cid:16)

(73)

(74)

r = R + λt (r′)

where

r(t) = −−−−−→QΛt(P ′), R(t) = −−−−−→QΛt(Q′) and r′(t) = −−→Q′P ′.

(75)

By diﬀerentiating (74) with respect to time, now absolute, we obtain a relation
between velocities,

v = V + ˙λt(r′) + λt(v′(t)),

(76)

21

where v(t) = ˙r(t), V(t) = ˙R(t) and v′(t) = ˙r′(t). From now on, the t index in
λ will be suppressed for a simpler notation.

Let us introduce the operator Ω :

deﬁned as

V → V
λ−1.

Ω = ˙λ

◦
By direct diﬀerentiation of the identities λ
we obtain the relation:

◦

x

Ω(x)

y =

Ω(y),

·

−

·

showing that Ω is an antisymmetric operator.

In terms of this operator, Equation (76) can be rewritten as

v = V + Ω [λ(r′)] + λ(v′).

λ−1 = id and λ−1(x)

λ−1(y) = x

y,

·

Let ω be the vector associated to the antisymmetric operator Ω, i. e. ω
Ω(y) [see Crampin et al.
in the more familiar form

y :=
(1986), p. 97]. Now, Equation (78) can be written

×

v = V + ω

[λ(r′)] + λ(v′).

×

Hence, ω is the usual angular velocity and reasonably we can call Ω the angular
velocity operator.

As an important application of the angular velocity operator, we are going
to derive an intrinsic expression for Coriolis theorem (see Dede et al. (1996) for
an unconventional derivation of that theorem based on an interesting graphical
trick, a kind of our tracer mapping). For that aim, we time diﬀerentiate
Equation (78) and obtain

Ω [λ(r′)]
}

{

+ 2Ω [λ(v′)] ,

(80)

the advertised Coriolis theorem. In this form, we see clearly which space each
quantity belongs to. Besides, the derivation is straightforward and intrinsic.

22

Finally, it is worth pointing out that whenever quantities in K ′ are to be ob-
tained from those in K or vice versa it suﬃces to use λ and its time derivatives
instead of Ω. The intrinsic deﬁnition of the angular velocity makes possible
to formulate the kinematics and dynamics of the rigid body in a completely
intrinsic way.

5.b Geometry of the rotating disk in special relativity

It is well known the important heuristic role played by the rotating disk in
the formulation of General Relativity [see Stachel (1989)]. Here we approach
the study of the geometry of the rotating disk in the framework of the Special
Relativity in a similar way as in Møller (1952), but trying to clarify the nature
both of the problem statement and its solution by using the intrinsic method
previously introduced.

The ﬁrst problem is to give a precise and meaningful deﬁnition of a rotating
disk. On the one hand, as in the rest of this paper, K is an inertial body of
reference. As such, the corresponding space is euclidean and provided with a
set of synchronized clocks. On the other hand, K ′ designates the rotating disk
which is made of a continuum of particles.

As before, we deﬁne the trace of any particle of the disk K ′ on K at time
t as the point in K coinciding with it at that time. We call Λt the tracer
mapping of K ′ on K,

Deﬁnition: We say that K ′ is a rotating disk around a point O of K if the
trace of any particle P ′ of K ′ describes a uniform circular motion around O,
with an angular velocity ω, the same for every particle.

We deﬁne a rotation operator in K around the point O by an angle θ as eiθ,

Λt : K ′

K.

→

eiθr.

r

7→

Let P ′ be a ﬁxed point in K ′. By deﬁnition, the vector −−−−−→OΛt(P ′) can be seen
as the rotated −−−−−→OΛ0(P ′) by the angle ωt, thus

(81)

(82)

The velocity of P ′ at t is

−−−−−→OΛt(P ′) = eiωt−−−−−→OΛ0(P ′).

V(P ′, t) =

−−−−−→OΛt(P ′) = iωeiωt−−−−−→OΛ0(P ′) = iω−−−−−→OΛt(P ′),

(83)

∂
∂t

23

where i rotates vectors by an angle of π/2 in the positive sense. This result
can be stated `a la Euler as the velocity of the disk particle coinciding at t with
the point P of K given as −→OP = −−−−−→OΛt(P ′), i. e., the trace of P ′ at t. Thus

v(P ) = iω−→OP = V(P ′, t) provided P = Λt(P ′).

(84)

Now, we are going to construct the disk spatial metric. For that aim we
introduce a collection of inertial bodies, comoving each with the velocity v(P ).
Thus, consider the reference body K ′
P comoving with the disk particle passing
by P at t. Being at relative rest, a little patch of K ′ around P ′ can be identiﬁed
with a similar portion of K ′
K can be
used for transforming the portion of K ′ into K. Therefore,

P , and thus the mapping ΛP
t

P →

: K ′

t (P ′ + dr′) = ΛP
ΛP

t (P ′) + λP (dr′).

Hence, the little displacement dr at K and the corresponding dr′ at the disk
are related as

dr = ΛP

t (P ′ + dr′)

t (P ′) = λP (dr′)
ΛP

(86)

(87)

Thus, we have obtained the local metric of the disk in terms of the metric
of its trace on K. This metric confers the disk a structure of a Riemannian
manifold.

We parametrize the points of the disk manifold by introducing polar co-
ordinates in K. The velocity of a point P (r, θ) of the disk, according to

24

Equation (84), is v(P ) = rωˆeθ. A small but arbitrary displacement from P ,
dr = dr ˆer +rdθ ˆeθ, can be divided into parallel and perpendicular components
respect to v(P ) as

Then, the expression for the metric (87) in the chosen chart is

dr2

U = r2dθ2 and dr2

T = dr2.

dr′2 = dr2 + γ2r2dθ2,

where γ, as given by (86), depends on the radial coordinate r. Finally, the
element of arc length is

dl′ =

dr2 + γ2r2dθ2.

6 Conclusions

We have developed an intrinsic method for deriving space and time transfor-
mations. For that purpose, following a suggestion by Einstein, we associated
a diﬀerent space of reference to every reference body. In order to connect the
space and time measurements in the spaces we introduced the tracer mapping,
a simple concept ﬁtted with a direct physical meaning, which makes possible
to express with a greater clarity several ideas of the special relativity.

The intrinsic method shows some advantages we are going to summarize:

1. The space and time transformations were derived using no coordinate
systems. Therefore, a clear distinction is now possible between a coor-
dinate system and a body of reference.

25

2. The tracer mapping allows a sharp deﬁnition for the geometry of a mov-
ing body: It is nothing but the geometry of its trace. A reference space
not equipped with clocks is an incomplete system to register events. Nev-
ertheless, as seen in the discussion of the rotating disk, we were able to
obtain its geometry by using the tracer mapping as it does nor require
any time measurement in that space.

3. The intrinsic method does not depend in any way on a notion of par-
allelism between both spaces of reference. Rather, the trace allows us
to deﬁne that parallelism in an operational way. Note that, in the non–
intrinsic derivations of the spacetime transformations, the coordinate
axes of both reference frames are assumed parallel to each other. But,
here we have not argued, for example, that u and u′ are parallel because
they belong to diﬀerent spaces. We aﬃrm, instead, that u and λ(u′) are
parallel.

4. Even though in the Galilean space and time one might identify the dif-
ferent spaces of reference, the lesson our derivation of Coriolis Theorem
teaches us is that the tracer mapping between separated spaces is useful
even in these cases, in which one could identify them.

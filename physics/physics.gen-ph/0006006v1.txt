Optical Approach to Gravitational Redshift

Yong-Gwan Yi∗

September 4, 2013

Abstract

This paper explores an optical interpretation of the gravitational redshift eﬀect, and
shows how the deﬂection of light and the radar echo delay can be calculated from the point
of view of optics. As a result of these considerations, this work establishes new relation-
ships between general relativity and geometrical optics with regard to the propagation of
light in the gravitational ﬁeld, introducing an optical metric - the optical version of the
Schwarzschild metric.

Introduction

The general theory of relativity is now accepted as the most satisfactory theory of gravita-
tion. This acceptance rests partly on its conceptual and structural elegance, and partly on its
agreement with experimental observation. But the theory has been essentially mathematical
in character, being concerned with the consequences of a “geometrization” of the space-time
manifold. Thus the application of the theory involves the use of special mathematical methods
which, although relevant to optics in many cases, may easily be considered separately from it.
In attempting to deduce their optical nature, one may pass from the mathematical language to
the physical language, and see how they can be reconciled with each other.

Four classic tests are usually cited as experimental veriﬁcations of the general theory of
relativity: the gravitational redshift of spectral lines, the deﬂection of light by the Sun, the
precession of the perihelion of the orbit of the planet Mercury, and the time delay of radar
echoes passing close to the Sun. Three of these tests examine the inﬂuence of the gravitational
potential on the propagation of light. Only the planetary orbit precession investigates the
motion of a particle of ﬁnite mass in the gravitational ﬁeld of the Sun. Because these are
optical phenomena, one may raise a question as to whether the three classic tests can also be
correctly inferred from the point of view of optics.

It is actually possible to predict these tests in a valid manner on the basis of optics. This
paper explores an optical version of gravitational redshift, and shows how the deﬂection of
light and the radar echo delay can be calculated therefrom. It will be of particular interest to
note that the deﬂection of light and the radar echo delay can also be correctly derived from the
equation of rays of geometrical optics without using the geodesic equations or the ﬁeld equations
of general relativity. As a consequence of these considerations, this paper will establish new
relationships between general relativity and geometrical optics, apparently unrelated areas of
physics, with regard to the inﬂuence of the gravitational potential on the propagation of light.

2 Redshift of Spectral Lines

In 1911, Einstein [1] predicted the change in the frequency of spectral lines with gravitational
potential, generally referred to as the gravitational redshift. The eﬀect was calculated from the
time dilatation in a gravitational potential which follows from the principle of equivalence. The
argument, as Einstein explains, was as follows:

“Let the two points S and S ′ be placed at rest, a distance h apart along the lines
of force in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld of acceleration g. In accordance with the
principle of equivalence, we are able, in place of the system K in this gravitational
ﬁeld, to set the gravitational-free system K ′ which is accelerated with (g. Consider
the process of propagation of radiation from S to S ′ from a system K0, which is
to be free from acceleration. At the moment when the radiation of frequency f is
emitted from S to S ′, let the velocity of K ′ relative to K0 be zero. The radiation
will arrive at S ′ when the time h/c has elapsed to a ﬁrst approximation. But at
this moment the velocity of S ′ relative to K0 is v(gh/c. Therefore, by Doppler’s
principle, the radiation arriving at S ′ does not possess the frequency f but a greater
frequency f ′ which is related to f to a ﬁrst approximation by the equation

f ′ = f(cid:18)1 +

v

c(cid:19) = f(cid:18)1 +

gh

c2 (cid:19).

(1)

By the equivalence of K and K ′, we may replace gh by the gravitational potential
if the same process takes place in the system K.”

Astronomical observations, though somewhat ambiguous, have tended to conﬁrm this eﬀect.
Since it does not seem possible to predict this interesting eﬀect without using the general
theory of relativity, the gravitational redshift is now recognized as resulting from the principle
of equivalence. However, contrary to the current recognition, it would always seem possible to
ﬁnd a natural expression for the gravitational redshift from the optical point of view. If one
seeks to introduce an optical nature of the gravitational redshift, one’s attention should be given
to the velocity v(gh/c, not to the principle of equivalence. At least phenomenologically, the
eﬀect would appear to be due to this change of velocity which the radiation experiences during
the propagation along the lines of force of the gravitational ﬁeld. Looking for a Newtonian
mechanical interpretation of it, one ﬁnds without diﬃculty that it is equal to the velocity
diﬀerence due to the medium or ﬂuid which the radiation experiences during the propagation
between the places at diﬀerent gravitational potential.

Let ρ be the density and φ be the gravitational potential with g = −∇φ. A pressure
uniform throughout a ﬂuid mass produces no eﬀect on the motion. The time rate of change of
the momentum of ﬂuid is equal to and opposite to the pressure gradient force in the medium.
If we calculate the velocity diﬀerence due to the medium or ﬂuid with diﬀering gravitational
potential according to

dv
dt

= −g or ∇φ,

(2)

we obtain the same velocity as that in (1). This leads to a simple physical interpretation of it:
the redshift eﬀect is attributed to the relative velocity change due to the medium or ﬂuid by
which light is aﬀected during propagation in the medium. Such an interpretation, in contrast
with its relativistic explanation, can be ﬁtted into the customary point of view of optics, in
that it ascribes the eﬀect to an optical phenomenon related to the velocity of propagation of
light in a non-uniform medium. Consequently, it leads us to consider the redshift eﬀect as
being purely optical in origin. In fact, it is diﬃcult to distinguish a physical diﬀerence in form

2

and content between the present interpretation and Einstein’s argument here quoted. There
is thus no objection in principle to interpreting the redshift result from the present point of
view. Although Einstein further explained it as due to the time dilatation between the clocks
in diﬀerent gravitational potentials, what he had found was phenomenologically no more than
the fact that the velocity of light is altered, linearly to a ﬁrst approximation, by the medium
as a result of the pressure gradient force.

A diﬀerence of interpretation already existed at the ﬁrst time of observation [2]. Jewell in
1897 and particularly Fabry and Boisson in 1909 found displacements of solar spectral lines
toward the red end of the spectrum, and ascribed them to an eﬀect of pressure in the absorbing
layer. However, Einstein’s theory of general relativity [3] in 1916 established in most physicist’s
minds the interpretation of the redshift eﬀect as the time dilatation in a gravitational potential,
and this rather unusual interpretation has survived until the present. Like most relativistic
explanations, the current interpretation is presented in the context of the four-vector space-
time approach. The present approach reopens the question of interpretation and reminds us
of the eﬀect of pressure on the redshift of solar spectral lines. This means that, apart from
the gravitational potential, any change in mechanical pressure, density and temperature of the
medium can also give rise to an eﬀect of the same kind on the redshift of spectral lines. To be
reconciled with general relativity, however, vacuum in optics should be understood as a vacuum
without even gravity.

In order to complete the present description, it is necessary to consider the hydrodynamic

equation. The hydrodynamic equation is

d

dt(cid:0)ρv(cid:1) = ∇(cid:0)ρφ(cid:1) − ∇P + Fv +

1
c

J × B.

(3)

In addition to the gravitational force and pressure terms, we have included viscous and magnetic
forces. As the Sun consists of a conducting medium with a magnetic ﬁeld, it is necessary to
include the magnetic force term in the hydrodynamic equation, leading to the magnetohydro-
dynamic equation. In the limit of very large conductivity, it is convenient to relate the current
density J to the magnetic induction B via Ampere’s law. If we use the vector identity and
neglect viscous eﬀects, the hydrodynamic equation takes the form

d

dt(cid:0)ρv(cid:1) = ∇(cid:18)ρφ − P −

B2

8π(cid:19) +

1

4π(cid:0)B · ∇(cid:1)B.

(4)

Since the time required for light to propagate a path dr is dr/c to a ﬁrst approximation, the
integration of (4) gives

v(r) =

for the relative change of velocity in the medium which light experiences during propagation
along the path. The velocity of light at the point of observation thereby becomes

c′(r) = c(cid:20)1 +

According to the present approach, the redshift eﬀect is attributed not to the time dilatation
between clocks in diﬀerent gravitational potentials but to the velocity of propagation of light
as aﬀected by the medium as a result of pressure gradient including gravitational potential.
This optical interpretation is consistent with the fact that such a redshift eﬀect is absent in the
spectrum lines of an atom due to the Coulomb potential of the atom.

An optical approach to the redshift eﬀect may shed additional light on the formulation and
particularly on its relation to property of the medium of propagation. From the point of view
of electromagnetic waves, light wave in (6) can be thought of as a wave in a medium with an
index of refraction given by c′(r) = c/n(r). Thus

(8)

This consideration illustrates how the present picture of redshift oﬀers a natural connection with
the framework of optics. To reconcile optics and general relativity, as previously remarked, a
vacuum must be understood to exclude ﬁelds of any kind. It has a consequence which is of
fundamental importance for describing the deﬂection of light and the radar echo delay from the
point of view of optics.

Terrestrial measurements are usually made with respect to a coordinate system ﬁxed in
the Earth, which rotates uniformly with a constant angular velocity ω relative to the inertial
system. To an observer in the rotating system, it therefore appears as if the medium is moving
under the inﬂuence of an eﬀective acceleration of gravity [4]

gef f = g − 2(ω × v) − ω × (ω × r).

(9)

The apparent gravitational force acting on the medium is the sum of the actual gravitational
force, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force. After this consideration, we must replace φ
by an eﬀective potential φef f with gef f in the case of a rotating system.

The redshift eﬀect was qualitatively in agreement with astronomical observations both in the
case of the Sun and in the case of white dwarf star like Sirius B where the eﬀect is about thirty
times larger. However, the quantitative agreement was not very good. While the frequency
shift in (1) is independent of the point of observation on the solar disk, observations [5] have
shown that the wavelength of spectral lines increases as the point of observation moves toward
the limb. Furthermore, the solar lines observed at the limb are deﬁnitely asymmetric, having
pronounced red ﬂanks. There seems to be a systematic change in proﬁle as one approaches the
limb. In atomic spectra [6], the broadening of a spectrum line due to pressure has shown that the
spectrum line observed is spread out more on the long wavelength side than it is on the short.
With increasing pressure, the mean collision time increases and the time between collisions
decreases with the result that, as the line is shifted to the red, it is broadened asymmetrically.
From this point of view, the asymmetry observed in limb lines seems to be of pressure character.
In fact, Blamont and Roddier [7] found a complete interpretation of their experimental value
at the limb when they added to the gravitational redshift the pressure redshift of the Lindholm
eﬀect. Assuming this to be so, their interpretation, as well as asymmetric proﬁle, has reminded
us of the eﬀect of pressure on the redshift of solar spectral lines, furnishing support for the
present approach.

In contrast to astronomical observations, terrestrial experiments using Mossbauer eﬀect are
able to test the gravitational redshift to an excellent accuracy. In the experiments [8], γ−rays
in a nuclear resonance passed through an evacuated tube or a tube ﬁlled with helium along
the lines of force of the gravitational ﬁeld, and yielded results that were in agreement with the
predicted shift in (1) after subtraction of the eﬀect due to the temperature diﬀerence between
the source and absorber. A measurement of redshift in a rapidly rotating system [9] was shown
to ﬁt the dependence of gef f on ω in (9).

3 Light Bending near the Sun

The general theory of relativity states that light rays propagated across a gravitational ﬁeld
undergo deﬂection. The theoretical value for the deﬂection of light rays that just graze the
Sun’s surface is 1.75′′. The deﬂection angle is classically measured by comparing the apparent
positions of stars that happen to lie near the solar disk during an eclipse, when their light comes
close to the Sun and yet may be detected, with their positions at night six months earlier, when
these stars lie on opposite sides of the Earth from the Sun, so their light does not pass close
to the Sun on its way to us. In eclipse of 1919, about a dozen stars in all were observed, and
yielded values 1.98±0.12′′ and 1.61±0.31′′, in substantial agreement with Einstein’s prediction.
It is perhaps this dramatic result more than any other success that brought general relativity
to the attention of the general public.

In radio astronomy, it is possible to measure the deﬂection of radio signals by the Sun
with potentially far greater accuracy than is possible in optical astronomy. Each October, the
quasi-stellar source 3C279 is occulted by the Sun, and radio astronomy groups have taken this
opportunity to measure the change in relative position of two discrete radio sources, 3C273 and
3C279, during the period before and after occultation. The observed deﬂections are separable
combination of the general relativistic eﬀect and of refraction in coronal electron plasma. For
example, at radio frequency of 2388 MHz [10], the maximum possible values of refractivities are
10−6 and 5 × 10−7 at 4R⊙ for the general relativistic eﬀect and the coronal electron plasma,
respectively, where R⊙ denotes the radius of the Sun. On the other hand, the coronal electron
plasma can be virtually ignored at frequencies of 8000-10000 MHz [11]. Hence, at frequencies
of 2000-4000 MHz, it is necessary to analyze the data in terms of a model, in which part of
deﬂection arises from general relativity, and the rest is produced by the corona.

The Schwarzschild metric, appropriate for the region exterior to a spherically symmetric

distribution of mass M , is given in the standard form as

c2dτ 2 = (cid:18)1 −

2GM

c2r (cid:19)c2dt2 −(cid:18)1 −

2GM

c2r (cid:19)−1

dr2 − r2(dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2).

(10)

In what follows, we use for the components of the metric tensor the expressions g00(r) =
1/grr(r) = 1 − 2GM/c2r. Assuming that the whole motion takes place in the plane ϕ = 0,
we obtain as the equations of motion three diﬀerential equations. For light rays propagating
along the geodesic lines, we replace the parameter τ by a parameter s describing trajectory. In
particular, Weinberg [12] chooses to normalize s so that

g00

cdt
ds

= 1

in g00

cdt
ds

= constant.

(11)

On the normalization condition he has combined the three diﬀerential equations into one dif-
ferential equation, which is of the same structure as (10). According to Weinberg, the change
in θ as r decreases from inﬁnity to its minimum value r0 is given by

r0

△θ =

Z

∞

(cid:20) g00(r0)r2

g00(r)r2

0 − 1(cid:21)−1/2 g1/2

r

rr (r)dr

.

(12)

This integral can be evaluated by expanding in the small parameters GM/c2r and GM/c2r0 to
ﬁrst order, giving 4GM/c2r0 for a light ray deﬂected by the Sun.

Having reviewed the deﬂection of light by the Sun, we now turn our attention to optics. The
gaseous layers surrounding the Sun, through which light propagates, are media of spherically
symmetric varying refractive index. The deﬂection of light can thus be thought as a result of

5

the refraction of light in such gaseous layers from the point of view of optics. If this thought
is reasonable, a similar conclusion will also be reached from this point of view. When we check
the propagation of light rays to this end, we realize that the equation of rays of geometrical
optics has previously had the form of (12).

In a homogeneous medium, the refractive index is a constant and the light rays have the
form of straight lines. Let us consider rays in a medium which has spherical symmetry, i.e.
where the refractive index depends only on the distance r from a ﬁxed point O: n = n(r). This
case is approximately realized by the Earth’s atmosphere, when the curvature of the Earth is
taken into account. The light rays are then plane curves, situated in a plane through the origin,
and along each ray satisfy

n(r)r sin ψ = constant,

(13)

where ψ is the angle between the position vector r and the tangent at the point r on the ray
[13]. Since ψ = π/2 at the point r0 of closest approach of the ray to the origin, Eq. (13) may
also be written as n(r0)r0 =constant. This relation is sometimes called the formula of Bouguer
in geometrical optics.
If (r, θ) are the polar coordinates of a plane curve, then the angle ψ
between the radius vector to a point r on the curve and the tangent at r is given by

sin ψ =

rdθ

(dr2 + r2dθ2)1/2 .

(14)

From (13), (14), and Bouguer’s formula, the equation of rays in a medium with spherical
symmetry has been written in the form

△θ = Z (cid:20) n2(r)r2

n2(r0)r2

0 − 1(cid:21)−1/2 dr

r

.

(15)

At ﬁrst sight, we can see a striking resemblance between this well-known equation and the
geodesic equation (12). In the equation of rays is absent a term arising from the diﬀerence
in path length. For lack of the term, the equation of rays corresponds to the case which is
obtained when the curvature of the physical space in a region of strong gravitational potential
is neglected. According to general relativity, the deﬂection of light is due partly to the varying
velocity of light and partly to the non-Euclidean character of the spatial geometry. Since
these are known to contribute equally to the deﬂection [14], it can therefore be stated that the
equation of rays will give a deﬂection of only half of the correct value.

This result is to be expected on optical grounds, because the non-Euclidean character of
the spatial geometry has been neglected in optics. In order to compensate for the change in
light path due to gravitational potential, one can use the notion of optical path. The optical
path represents the distance light travels in a vacuum in the same time it travels a distance
in the medium. If a light ray travels in a medium with spherical symmetry, the optical path
is given by integral over n(r)dr. This means that the radial interval of integration must be
corrected by multiplication with n(r) to take into account the diﬀerence in path length due to
gravitational potential. Upon integration over n(r)dr instead of the original integration over
dr, it would yield a result in which the eﬀect arising from the diﬀerence in path length is taken
into consideration. Using the optical path to correct the change in light path, the equation of
rays is modiﬁed to

△θ = Z (cid:20) n2(r)r2

n2(r0)r2

0 − 1(cid:21)−1/2 n(r)dr

r

.

(16)

The modiﬁed equation of rays is then in complete agreement in structure with (12). From the
proposition which has just been proved, one may picture what it is to be a curved space in a

6

region of strong gravitational potential. When viewed from the present point, the curvature of
the physical space in the gravitational ﬁeld of the Sun can best be understood in terms of the
medium with spherical symmetry in which the path of rays is to be curved.

A comparison of (16) with (12) identiﬁes n2(r) with grr(r).

In the equation of rays of
geometrical optics, n2(r) plays exactly the same role grr(r) has played in the geodesic equation
of general relativity. This suggests introducing an optical metric tensor n2(r) consisting of the
gravitational potential plus the mechanical pressure and the magnetic pressure. Taking only
the leading gravitational potential into account, both of these equations give the same result
for the deﬂection of light by the Sun. Thus the optical metric here proposed complements the
Schwarzschild metric to this extent. Its line element will then be reconciled with the eikonal
equation. The most important is that the existence of the deﬂection of light and its value can
also be derived in the explicit form on the basis of geometrical optics. The emphasis should be
on the fact that the deﬂection of light can be interpreted as a result of the refraction of light in
the gaseous layers surrounding the Sun.

If we further include a frequency-dependent dielectric constant deﬁned by Maxwell’s equa-
tion ǫ(ω) = n2(ω), we can obtain the explicit and integrated form of the optical metric
and exhibit completely its frequency dependence. Using (8) and the dielectric constant with
ǫ(0) = n2(0), we ﬁnd far above the highest resonant frequency

n2(r, ω) = ǫ(ω)n2(r) = (cid:18)1−

where m and e are the mass and charge on the electron, and N is the total number of electrons
per unit volume. Using this optical metric in (16) will provide a theoretical curve in the
explicit and integrated form for observation that any beam of radiation is deﬂected during its
passage near the Sun as a result of the general relativistic eﬀect and of refraction in the coronal
electron plasma. Since the characteristics of the propagation obviously depend on the index
of refraction n(ω), it seems very natural to expect the frequency dependence of the deﬂection
so discussed. In fact, Muhleman, Ekers, and Fomalont [10] analyzed their experimental data
by using geometrical-optics techniques in a spherically symmetric refracting medium of index
n(r, ω) = 1 + 2GM/c2r − 2πe2N (r)/mω2, where N (r) is the electron-density proﬁle in the
corona and interplanetary medium. Their interpretation is qualitatively in agreement with the
present approach.

4 Radar Echo Delay

In 1964, Shapiro [15] proposed a fourth test of general relativity. The test involves measuring
the time delays between transmission of radar signals from Earth to either Mercury or Venus
and detection of the echoes. Because, according to the general theory of relativity, the speed
of propagation of light depends on the strength of gravitational potential along its path, the
time delays are maximum when the inner planets are at superior conjunction and the radar
signals just graze the solar limb. The maximum round-trip excess time delays are estimated to
be about 200 µsec. Such a change, equivalent to 60 km in distance, could be measured over the
required path length with modern radar equipment by Shapiro and his collaborators [16]. The
most reliable of the measured data agree, on the average, with this excess delay predictions of
general relativity to well within the experimental uncertainty of ±20%.

7

According to Weinberg, the time required for light to go from r0 to r′ is given by

△t =

r′

Z

r0

(cid:20)1 −

g00(r)r2
0

g00(r0)r2(cid:21)−1/2(cid:18) grr(r)

g00(r)(cid:19)1/2 dr

c

.

(18)

The integral can be evaluated by expanding in the small parameters GM/c2r and GM/c2r0 to
ﬁrst order, giving 240 µsec for the maximum round-trip excess time delay.

We are now in a position to derive an optical form of expression for the excess time delay.
Its explicit form will follow from an equation which speciﬁes the path of rays. An accurate
expression we seek can then be obtained by converting the equation of rays into an equation
for the path of rays.

A procedure starts from (14). Substitution of (14) into (13) gives

n(r)r2dθ

(dr2 + r2dθ2)1/2 = constant.

(19)

Since the path of rays is ds = (dr2(r2dθ2)1/2 in the polar coordinates of plane curve, this may
also be written as

Solving for ds, we have

ds

n(r)r2dθ

= constant.

ds =

n(r)r2dθ
n(r0)r0

.

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

In the above equation, Bouguer’s formula n(r0)r0 =constant has been used. By making use of
the integral in (15), the variable of integration can be changed from dθ to dr, thereby obtaining
the result:

△s = Z (cid:20)1 −

n2(r0)r2
0

n2(r)r2 (cid:21)−1/2

dr.

Hence, by dividing ds by c′(r) = c/n(r), the time of propagation of rays is found to be

△t = Z (cid:20)1 −

n2(r0)r2
0

n2(r)r2 (cid:21)−1/2 n(r)dr

c

,

where c′(r) is the speed of propagation of light in a region of gravitational potential. Although
the details are altered by the new form of expression, the optical characteristics of (23) remain
the same as in (15). Thus, for the correct calculation of excess time delay, we must consider in
addition the diﬀerence in the path of rays due to gravitational potential.

As discussed in the equation of rays for the deﬂection, this requires integrating the resulting
equation along the optical path. However, it draws a clear distinction between geometrical
optics and general relativity, because (23) has already manifested the form of the integral over
the optical path. To be reconciled with general relativity, in addition to the varying velocity
of light with gravitational potential, the diﬀerence in path length must also be taken into
consideration. If we make a correction in the radial component of the path of rays, that is, in
the component of the path along the lines of force of the gravitational ﬁeld, the integral in (23)
becomes

△t = Z (cid:20)1 −

n2(r0)r2
0

n2(r)r2 (cid:21)−1/2 n2(r)dr

c

.

(24)

The modiﬁed integral and that in (18) are again in complete agreement in structure. There
is indeed no diﬀerence, to ﬁrst order in GM/c2r and GM/c2r0, between (18) and (24). This

8

once again identiﬁes n2(r) with grr(r) in their roles, leading us to consider n2(r) as an optical
metric tensor and thus to reconcile its eikonal equation with the line element. It is apparent
that the equation of rays of geometrical optics also predicts the radar echo delay in exactly the
same form as given by the geodesic equation of general relativity.

5 Plasma Eﬀect of Corona

Having established new relationships between general relativity and geometrical optics, we can
now discuss the classic tests of general relativity from the point of view of optics. In particular,
the present approach aﬀords a straightforward way to calculate the plasma eﬀect of the solar
corona on the deﬂection of light and the radar echo delay. Simultaneous equivalently accurate
measurements at various frequencies will allow the plasma eﬀect to be deduced, since the plasma
eﬀect is frequency dependent and the general relativistic eﬀect is not. The plasma eﬀect of the
solar corona is evaluated in this section.

As a ﬁrst important example of the plasma eﬀect of the solar corona, we consider the deﬂec-
tion of light as a combination of the general relativistic eﬀect and of refraction in the coronal
plasma. The expected angular deﬂection can be accurately computed using the frequency-
dependent refractive index expressed in (17) in the equation of rays (16):

△θ = Z (cid:20) n2(r, ω)r2

n2(r0, ω)r2

0 − 1(cid:21)−1/2 n(r, ω)dr

r

.

(25)

In order to evaluate this integral, we use in the integrand expansions in the small parameters.
It is both easier and more instructive to evaluate the integral after the expansions. The calcu-
lations can be carried to ﬁrst order in the small parameters with high accuracy. We now carry
out the integration of (25).

The argument of the square root in (25) can be expanded to ﬁrst order in the small param-

eters as

Consequently, the deﬂections from the individual eﬀects are combined linearly. Refraction eﬀect

This must be an addition to the general relativity deﬂection.

In the Allen-Baumbach model [17], the electron-density proﬁle in the corona is assumed
to have the form N (r) = 1.55 × 108(R⊙/r)6 electron/cm3. Using more recent results on the
corona, Erickson [18] found that N (r) = 5 × 105(R⊙/r)2 electron/cm3 represents the data
reasonably well from 4R⊙ to 20R⊙. Refraction eﬀect is signiﬁcant where r < 3R⊙, at which

9

the (R⊙/r)6 term dominates. Hence we use the electron distribution of the Allen-Baumbach
model, resulting in

The total change in θ as r decreases from inﬁnity to its minimum value r0 and then increases
again to inﬁnity is just twice its change from ∞ to r0, that is, 2△θ. Hence the deﬂection of
the path of rays from a straight line is given by δθ = 2△θ − π, which is calculated positively
if concave toward the Sun and negatively if convex. Putting in the numerical factors, the total
deﬂection is

Equation (31) describes interesting behavior of the radiation bending near the Sun. The
ﬁrst term represents the general relativistic eﬀect by which the path of rays is bent toward
the Sun. The second term represents the coronal refraction by which the path of rays is bent
away from the Sun to the contrary. This is not surprising when we see the diﬀerence in sign
between these terms. Actually, experimental values at radio frequencies of the general relativity
deﬂection were determined by ﬁtting, by the method of least squares, the measured data to
curve of a model bearing diﬀerence of sign between these eﬀects. At optical frequencies, coronal
refraction is extremely small, so it can be neglected. However, at radio frequencies, it plays
an important part in the deﬂection, as can be seen when we illustrate the deﬂection angle as
a function of frequency for the distances in solar radii of the ray’s point of closest approach to
the Sun’s center.

The question might be raised as to whether varying velocity of light in the coronal plasma
also gives rise to a change in path length therein. If we assume that varying velocity of light in
the coronal plasma does not give rise to a change in path length of rays therein, the radial interval
of integration must still be corrected by multiplication with n(r) even in the coronal plasma, not
with n(r, ω) as used in (25). We must then drop the fourth term in the integrand of the integral
in (27), that is, the ﬁrst term in (28). Coronal refraction thus obtained will be exactly the same
as what one ﬁnds by evaluating the original equation of rays (15) on purely optical grounds.
Note that there is a complete agreement in the form of expression for the plasma eﬀect between
(15) and (25) with such an assumption. In fact, the evaluation of coronal refraction from the
equation of rays (15) was carried out to ﬁrst order by Bracewell, Eshelman, and Hollweg [19].
Their calculation gives 82(R⊙/r0)6 sec for the angular deviation of a ray of frequency 9.6 GHz
in the corona assuming the Allen-Baumbach model. When Erickson’s coronal model is instead
assumed, the angular deviation is given by 0.14(R⊙/r0)2 sec. Seielstad, Sramek, and Weiler
[11] used in data analysis these values as parameters describing refraction eﬀects in the solar
corona, when they measured the deﬂection of 9.602 GHz radiation from 3C279 in the solar
gravitational ﬁeld using an interferometer at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. The results
of their calculation are indeed in exact agreement with what we would obtain from each model if
we excluded the ﬁrst term from the integrand of the integral in (28) under such a consideration.
However, on the assumption that varying velocity of light in the coronal plasma also gives rise
to the change thereby in path length of rays, Eq. (31) gives coronal refraction of 96(R⊙/r0)6 sec

10

for 9.6 GHz frequency. If we used Erickson’s coronal model, we would obtain coronal refraction
of 0.21(R⊙/r0)2 sec. To say it in terms of the metric tensor here proposed, the diﬀerence of
calculation can be viewed in a way that is very helpful in providing physical insight into the
term arising from the diﬀerence in path length. In (31), we have used the metric tensor of the
components

g00 = 1/ǫ(ω)n2(r)

and grr = ǫ(ω)n2(r).

(32)

As viewed from the present approach, their calculation corresponds to the case which is obtained
when the components of the metric tensor are

g00 = 1/ǫ(ω)n2(r) but

grr = n2(r) or 1.

(33)

The reason for this diﬀerence is readily understood by referring to the equations of rays (16)
and (15) from which angular deviations were respectively calculated.

As a second example of the plasma eﬀect, let us calculate the plasma eﬀect of the solar
corona on the radar echo delay. The time required for light to go from r0 to r′ is given by
(24). To evaluate the dependence of the radar echo delay on the frequency being propagated,
we must consider (24) with the frequency-dependent refractive index in (17):

t(r0, r′) =

(34)

In order to evaluate this integral, we once again use in the integrand the expansions in the
small parameters to ﬁrst order. Proceeding in exactly the same way as for (25), Eq. (34) gives

t(r0, r′) ≃

The time required for radar signals to travel to Mercury and be reﬂected back to Earth is
2[t(rE, r0) + t(r0, rM )], where rE and rM are astronomical radii of the orbits of the Earth
and the Mercury around the Sun. The round-trip excess time delay is then given by δt =
2[t(rE, r0) + t(r0, rM ) − T (rE, r0) − T (r0, rM )], where T (rE, r0) and T (r0, rM ) are the times
required for radar signals to travel the paths in straight lines at speed c. The distance r0 of
closest approach of the radar wave to the center of the Sun is much smaller than the distances
rE and rM of the Earth and Mercury from the Sun.

Assuming the electron distribution of the Allen-Baumbach model, the integral yields

(37)

As in the case of the deﬂection, because of the sign diﬀerence, the plasma eﬀect of the solar
corona on the time delay is opposite to what is usually expected from the general relativistic
eﬀect. For either equation, the positive terms on the right describe a general relativistic delay
in the time it takes a radar signal to travel to Mercury and back. In contrast, the negative
terms describe a coronal plasma contraction, that is, a radar time contraction. Equations (36)

11

and (37) describe frequency dependence of round-trip excess time delay for the distances of
closest approach of the radar wave to the center of the Sun.

We now compare Shapiro’s calculation with the results obtained from the preceding equa-
tions. At the beginning of measurement, Shapiro estimated δt ≃ 1.4 × 10−4 − 3.7 × 10−4 sec
for observations of Mercury near superior conjunction with r0 ≈ 4R⊙ at 430 MHz frequency
of the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory. This diﬀerence in time delays between the general
relativistic eﬀect and the coronal plasma eﬀect was nowhere large enough and positive for a
really reliable result to be obtained solely from Arecibo data. He was thus tried to reduce the
plasma eﬀect by a factor of almost 400 by using measurements made at 8350 MHz frequency
of Haystack radar of Lincoln Laboratory. For observation of Mercury with r0 = 4R⊙ at 430
MHz radiation, Eq. (36) gives δt ≃ 1.8 × 10−4 − 12.6 × 10−4 sec, and Eq. (37), in which the
same model as used by Shapiro has been assumed, gives δt ≃ 1.8 × 10−4 − 11.9 × 10−4 sec.
The values obtained for the plasma eﬀect are about three times larger than Shapiro’s estimate.
This is because we have made a correction in the radial interval of the path and integrate the
resulting equation along the optical path bending near the Sun, unlike Shapiro’s calculation
along the optical path in straight line without any corrections. If we assume that the diﬀerence
in path length is due solely to diﬀering gravitational potential, the radial interval of integration
must still be corrected by multiplication with n(r) even in the coronal plasma, not with n(r, ω)
as used in (34). The excess time delays are then given by 1.8 × 10−4 − 8.4 × 10−4 sec and
1.8 × 10−4 − 7.9 × 10−4 sec, respectively. The values so obtained for the plasma eﬀect are
just what we should expect if the excess time delays were calculated from the equation of rays
without any correction on purely optical grounds.

6 Conclusion

The discussion in this paper shows that the redshift eﬀect is attributed not to the gravitational
potential alone but to the pressure gradient including the gravitational potential in the medium
through which light propagates. Asymmetry observed in limb lines furnishes physical support
for the eﬀect of pressure on the redshift of solar spectral lines. It has shown that the equation
of rays of geometrical optics can also predict the correct values for the deﬂection of light and
the radar echo delay by the Sun. Furthermore, agreement in structure between the equations of
rays of geometrical optics and the geodesic equations of general relativity suggests introducing
an optical metric of n2(r) consisting of the gravitational potential, the mechanical pressure,
the magnetic pressure, and viscous eﬀects in the medium of propagation. These results are
obtained without direct calculations only by comparing the equations of rays with the geodesic
equations formulated by Weinberg. In the light of this fact, Weinberg’s formalism has opened a
door to establish new relationships between general relativity and geometrical optics. Indeed,
it was the formal similarity between (12) and (15) that enabled the present approach to be
proposed.

The author should like to express his gratitude to a reviewer for corrections, criticism, and
language corrections of the early draft of this paper. The author guesses the reviewer to be
Prof. M. D. Kruskal. The reviewer’s comments on the redshift result are so instructive that
the author would like to accompany herewith:

Comments: [1] The redshift equation, Eq. 1 should hold for any acceleration. If derivable
from a potential one could postulate that gh/c be replaced by the right member of Eq. 5 and
then deﬁne n(r) by Eq. 8. This would avoid the potential confusion of ﬂuid drag eﬀects, as in
Fizeau’s experiments, and also divorce the proposed eﬀect from ﬂuid ﬂow per se. As the eﬀects
all stem from relative accelerations of reference frames, a clear description of what constitutes
proper frames within and outside a “ﬂuid” is needed.

[2] I do not think that it is always possible to attribute the redshift to a relative velocity
between an inertial frame and a frame moving with a ﬂuid. It may be possible that a relative
acceleration between frames causes a local redshift and a cumulative time delay. I think that
an appeal to the principle of equivalence is still necessary in order to include all causes of
acceleration as causes of redshift.

[3] Without doing all of the manipulations required for proof, I suspect that one could
retrieve the redshift implied by Eq. 5 from the ﬁeld equations of general relativity. The terms
beyond gravitational potential should be contained within the stress-energy tensor of the right
member of the ﬁeld equations. This is no criticism of Eq. 5; in fact it is good to have an
intuitive way of arriving at the redshift result.

[4] The author describes Einstein’s interpretation of redshift as a manifestation of time
dilation in a gravitational potential as “rather unusual”. I believe that this is unwarranted. At
this point in the development of the author’s optical analogy he has tied everything to changes
caused by properties of the “medium” of propagation. Since there are eﬀects clearly due to a
gravitational ﬁeld in the absence of any other “medium”, and other interpretations are lacking
at this point, I believe that it is incorrect to call Einstein’s interpretation “rather unusual”.

Reply: I learn much from his comments. But I cannot agree to the point [4]. It reveals a
diﬀerence of standpoint looking at the relativity theory between the current paradigm (reviewer)
and the opponent (author). What the experiment has actually demonstrated is a change in
wavelength or frequency with gravitational potential, not a change in rate of clock with it. One
can see from the original paper that Einstein presented the interpretation of the redshift eﬀect
as a result of ﬁtting the predicted speed of light c′ = c(1 + gh/c2) even deliberately into the
postulate of the constancy of the speed of light. I think that Einstein put the cart before the
horse in its interpretation, apart from the controversy of whether the postulate is consistent or
inconsistent.

7 Appendix: Review of Planetary Motion

According to the general theory of relativity, the elliptical orbit of a planet rotates in its own
plane in the same direction as the planet moves. For the motion of Mercury in which the eﬀect
can be detected most easily, the theory predicts an advance of the perihelion of angle 43.03′′
per century. This value is in excellent agreement with 42.56± 0.94′′ that is left after subtraction
of all other known eﬀects from the total observed motion [20]. Einstein’s announcement of the
general theory of relativity in its deﬁnitive form was immediately hailed by some astronomers
as explaining a previously unaccountable discrepancy between the observed and theoretical mo-
tions of this planet, although some astronomers were, however, intuitively opposed to relativity.
It must be by far the most important experimental veriﬁcation of general relativity, both by
means of the formal clarity brought to the theory by a space-time geometrization and by virtue
of its high accuracy.

In this appendix, we wish to review the equation of the orbit in terms of the energy and
angular momentum. The planet’s path is not an ellipse but an exceedingly complicated space-
curve due to the disturbing eﬀects of all of the other planets. The equation of the orbit may
therefore be meaningless, but we can still talk in terms of the system energy and the system
angular momentum. For many applications, the equation of motion containing the energy and
angular momentum is the natural one. In order to discuss the comparison with Newton’s theory
or the transition to quantum theory, it is important that the description of the motion be in
terms of its energy and angular momentum.

Let us see what can be learned from Einstein’s theory, using only the equations of motion
in the Schwarzschild metric ﬁeld, before deriving the orbit equation. We begin by pointing out
that the path length of a particle in a static isotropic gravitational ﬁeld is ds2 = gµνdxmudxnu.
The square of velocities is then given by

c2 → g00c2,

dt(cid:19)2
v2 → grr(cid:18) dr

dt(cid:19)2
+ r2(cid:18) dθ

.

In consequence of this relation the Schwarzschild metric in (10) can be written

dτ = g1/2

00 dt(cid:18)1 −

v2

c2(cid:19)1/2

,

(38)

(39)

to a ﬁrst approximation. This form of equation reduces to the familiar equation leading to the
Lorentz time dilation in the limit as g00 approaches to unity. In this sense one may say the
relation in (A.2) as the Schwarzschild time dilation.

The equations of motion in the Schwarzschild ﬁeld yield two constants of motion. One of

them is given by

g00

dt
dτ

= constant,

(40)

which corresponds to the energy of the system. The other constant is obtained from r2(dθ/dτ ) =
constant, and is absorbed immediately into the deﬁnition of the angular momentum. It would
seem at ﬁrst sight that the constant in (A.3) is of no importance, for clearly any constant of
integration can be added to the right of (A.3) without aﬀecting the validity of the equation.
However, it is evident that the constant has an important physical signiﬁcance, for it can bring
the formulation of the resulting relativistic mechanics in terms of the energy of a particle as in
the case of Hamiltonian in Newtonian mechanics. The relativistic equations of motion must be
such that in the nonrelativistic limit they go over into the customary forms given by Newton’s
theory. Thus the task of identifying the constant is greatly facilitated by seeking the form
which it would have in the nonrelativistic limit. In the nonrelativistic limit, Eq. (A.3) can be
expanded as

(44)

Equations (A.6) and (A.7) are the necessary relativistic generalizations for the energy and
momentum of a particle, consistent with the conservation laws and the postulates of general
relativity.

As in the special theory of relativity, it is natural to attempt to identify the four equations
of energy and momentum conservation as relations among the energy-momentum four-vectors.
We observe that the momentum in (A.7) is proportional to the spatial components of the
four-velocity deﬁned as √gµµdxµ/dτ in (A.1). The time component of this four-velocity is
√g00cdt/dτ . Comparison with (A.6) shows that the energy of a particle diﬀers from its time
component by the rest energy mc2. We are thus led to

E = mc2g00

(45)
as the covariant form of the total energy, for then the momentum p and E/c√g00 form an
energy-momentum four-vector. Formally the connection between the energy E and the momen-
tum is expressed in the Schwarzschild metric in (10) or in the statement that the magnitude of
the momentum four-vector is constant:
E 2

dt

θ(cid:1) = m2c2.

(46)

Equation (A.9) is an extension of the relation T 2/c2− p2 = m2c2 in special relativity that meets
the requirements of general relativity.
Note that the gravitational potential lends itself to incorporation in the metric of space-
time geometrization, so the potential energy is absorbed automatically into the path length of
a particle and its motion therein. In general relativity, therefore, such energies as kinetic energy
and potential energy become meaningless any more; only one energy of a particle is needed to
solve the equations of motion in their most general forms.

Having formulated the relativistic expression for energy, we can now review the relativity
eﬀect in the equation of the orbit of planet in terms of the energy and angular momentum of
the system. For comparison with Newton’s theory, it is preferable to deﬁne the energy E as in
(A.6), which would bring E in line with the nonrelativistic value. The Schwarzschild metric in
(10) can now be expressed in terms of two constants of motion E and l as

r2 = m2c2.

(47)

This equation can also be obtained from a combination of the diﬀerential equations resulting
from the geodesic equations. But most often we are more interested in the shape of orbits, that
is, in r as a function of θ, than in their time history. The angular momentum relation can then
be used directly to convert (A.10) into the diﬀerential equation for the orbit; this gives

The solution may thus be determined by a quadrature:

The expressions for the energy and angular momentum appear here in somewhat diﬀerent
forms involving the metric tensors g00(r±), but their equivalence in the limit as g00 → 1 with

where C ≃ 1−(2GM/c2)(1/r+ +1/r−). The constant C could be determined by letting r → ∞.
We can obtain the same result more simply if we use the expansion in GM/c2r in the formal
solution of the equation of motion given by (A.12). The process of arriving at the orbit equation
is particularly simple here. The angle swept out by the position vector is then given by (A.12)

As it stands, this indeﬁnite integral is of the standard form. The integrand diﬀers from the
corresponding nonrelativistic expression in that the second term in each parenthesis represents
the relativistic correction. Equation (A.18) is the general-relativity analogue of Sommerfeld’s
treatment of the hydrogen atom in special relativity.

and θ0 is a constant of integration. In addition to the motion of the perihelion of a planet,
the relativity eﬀect produces the term (GM/c2r2)(dr/dθ) in the angle swept out by the radius
vector of the planet. This term is not a new result but merely a result of rewriting the square
root in the integrand which the integration of (A.17) or (A.18) actually yields, using (A.12)
to a ﬁrst approximation. It is evident therefore that the relativity eﬀect in planetary motion
obeying (A.17) or (A.18), is to cause not only the precession of the perihelion of the orbit of a
planet but also the change in the angular displacement of the planet due to its radial velocity.
The additional change appearing in the angular displacement of the planet, which does not
appear in a circular orbit, might be an eﬀect due to the ﬁnite velocity of propagation of the
solar gravitational ﬁeld.

In order to calculate △θ to ﬁrst order in GM/c2r, we need g00 to second order in GM/c2r.
To say it in another way, the current discussion of the planetary orbit precession serves as a
touchstone for the possible forms of metric tensor by requiring the degree of agreement to second
order. Equations (A.17) and (A.18) are obtained by setting g00(r) = 1 − 2GM/c2r. But the
optical approach discussed in the previous sections gives a metric tensor that can be expressed
as g00(r) = (1 − GM/c2r)2, when only the gravitational potential is taken into consideration.
Unless the optical approach is incorrect, we can gain further insight into the metric tensor
by assuming that the usual rules for the motion of particles and light rays in a given metric
ﬁeld gµν still apply, but that the metric for the motion of particles may be diﬀerent from that
for light rays. While the metric for the motion of particles is determined by comparing the
geodesic equations with Newton’s equation of motion of a particle, indeed, the metric for light
rays is determined in this paper by comparing the geodesic equations with the hydrodynamic
equation describing the state of motion of the medium of propagation. In the optical approach,
it has shown that the metric tensor grr is identiﬁed with the square of a refractive index of the
medium with spherical symmetry. However, it is true that such an interpretation of the metric
tensor grr cannot be applied identically to the equation of motion of material particles.

Abstract

A numerical investigation for the stability of the incompressible slip ﬂow of normal quan-
tum ﬂuids (above the critical phase transition temperature) inside a microslab where surface
acoustic waves propagate along the walls is presented. Governing equations and associated
slip velocity and wavy interface boundary conditions for the ﬂow of normal ﬂuids conﬁned
between elastic wavy interfaces are obtained. The numerical approach is an extension (with
a complex matrix pre-conditioning) of the spectral method. We found that the critical
Reynolds number (Recr or the critical velocity) decreases signiﬁcantly once the slip velocity
and wavy interface eﬀects are present and the latter is dominated (Recr mainly depends on
the wavy interfaces).

1 Introduction

Ultrasound measurements play very important roles in a 3He investigation1. The time scale of

ultrasound corresponds to quasiparticle life times at low temperatures and ﬁrst to zero sound

crossover was observed. Energy scales of ultrasound match the binding energies of Cooper
pairs in superﬂuid 3He were observed coupling through density oscillations. Sound transmis-

sion method using many types of surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors have been developed

for acoustical and electrical property measurements of adjacent liquid or gas (especially liquid
4He at low temperature2). A Rayleigh-SAW propagates along the substrate surface by emitting

compressional waves into the quantum ﬂuid and thus the sampling of the Rayleigh-SAW is de-

termined by the acoustic impedance of the surrounding quantum ﬂuids. Relevant problems are
the instability for the ﬂow induced by the SAW3,4 or the slip eﬀect existing along the interface of

the quantum ﬂuid. In fact, the instability may triggers the laminar-turbulent transition for ﬂows
of the superﬂuid. The important issue is to determine the critical velocity5,6 for the relevant

physical parameters so that the experimental measurements could be under control.

A most striking characteristic of liquid helium is that it exists in the liquid state down to the

absolute zero temperature because (i) the van der Waals forces in helium are weak; (ii) the zero-

point energy, due to the light mass, is large. In fact, it is called a quantum liquid due to these

kinds of quantum eﬀects and is closely related to the Bose-Einstein condensation for He II. The

well-known properties of He II can be largely accounted for on the basis of phenomenological
two-ﬂuid theory7,8. One of the basic assumptions of the two-ﬂuid model is : He II consists of

a kind of mixture of two components, a normal component and a superﬂuid component. The

1

former has viscosity while the superﬂuid can move without friction as long as certain velocity

limits are not exceeded.
One crucial issue for the related researches about He II is the critical velocity5,6,9 (when it

ﬂows through a capillary or plane channel) which depends on the micro-channel size. Landau

attributed the existence of a critical velocity in He II to the breakdown of the superﬂuid due to

the creation of excitations (he proposed that phonons and rotons are two types of excitations

which make up the normal ﬂuid). If the velocity is less than the critical value, there will be

no dissipation or friction along the boundary or interface for the ﬂow. In plane channel or slab

ﬂows of quantum ﬂuids, to determine the critical velocity corresponds to ﬁnding out the critical
Reynolds number5−6,10.

The traditional starting point of an investigation of hydrodynamic stability is eigenvalue anal-

ysis, which proceeds in : (i) linearize about the laminar solution and then (ii) look for unstable
eigenvalues of the linearized problem. In much of the literature of hydrodynamic stability10, at-

tention has been restricted to 2D perturbations, in particular, the well-known Orr-Sommerfeld

equation is an eigenvalue equation for 2D perturbations. For pressure-driven ﬂow, with the
no-slip boundary conditions (which are normally valid in macro-channels), eigenvalue analysis11

predicts a critical Reynolds number Recr = 5772 at which instability should ﬁrst occur, but in
the laboratory12, transition to turbulence is observed at Recr as low as ∼ 1000.

As for quantum ﬂuids or liquids, there always exists a slip velocity along the static interface or
conﬁnement due to the microscopically incomplete momentum exchange therein13. The distinc-

tion among various ﬂow regimes can be obtained by introducing the Knudsen number (which

also characterizes the value of the slip velocity13), Kn=mfp/L, where mfp is the mean free path

and L is the characteristic ﬂow dimension. Slip ﬂow conditions exist for 0.001 <Kn≤ 0.1, where

the ﬂow can be considered continuous if the slip velocity at the walls are taken into account.

Meanwhile, the eﬀect of elastic or deformable interfaces, like surface acoustic waves (SAW)
interacted with volume and surface phonons (propagating along the elastic boundaries14−17),

upon the stability of quantum ﬂuid ﬂows, however, were seldom considered before, to the best

knowledge of the authors. Although the mathematical diﬃculty is essential therein. Note that,

entrainment of ﬂuids induced by SAW propagating along deformable boundaries have been
studied14 since early 1950s. The role of elastic macroscopic walls resembles that of microscopic
phonons4. As presented in [4], for the description of the transport processes in the nonequilib-

rium gas-solid system including the processes occurring in the case of propagation of sound in a

f , n, and H denote the distribution function for gases, volume phonons, and surface phonons, re-

other notations or symbols. The stability problems for such a system of diﬀerential-integral equa-

tions remain open up to now. To escape from above (many-body problems) diﬃculties, we plan
to use the macroscopic approach which is a complicated extension of previous approaches16,18.

In this work, the stability analysis of incompressible slip ﬂows for a normal ﬂuid (above the tran-

sition temperature Tc) inside a microchannel with the ﬂow conﬁned by two elastic (wall) layers

of thin ﬁlms where surface (acoustic) waves are propagating along the interfaces is conducted.

Namely, we will relax the static- or rigid-interface boundary conditions which are frequently used

in previous theoretical and/or experiment approaches into the dynamic- or deformable-interface

boundary conditions which are more realistic in essence when we consider the ﬂow stability
problem in a microdomain where surface acoustic waves15 propagating along the boundaries of
quantum ﬂuids2,4. The veriﬁed code which was based on the spectral method developed by
Chu18 will be extended here to include the boundary conditions coming from SAW existing

along the interfaces to obtain the stability characteristics of the basic ﬂow.

This paper is organized as follows. We introduce the mathematical formulation for the Orr-

Sommerfeld equation and the relevant linear stability analysis in Section 2. Boundary condi-

tions for the slip ﬂow and the wavy interface of the ﬂuid system are then incorporated. The

expression for primary slip ﬂows of quantum ﬂuids we shall investigate their stability charac-

teristic will be derived before we describe the numerical approach : a modiﬁed spectral method

at the end of this Section. Two physical parameters, K0 (relevant to the SAW eﬀect) and Kn

will be introduced or deﬁned. Finally we shall present our calculations and discuss them. Our

results illustrate that the critical Reynolds number (Recr) decreases (to 1441) rapidly once the

interfaces are subjected to propagating waves (or noises) and there are slip velocities existing

along the boundaries or interfaces (K0 = 1 and Kn=0.001). However, the slip velocity (adjusted

by Kn) eﬀect is minor and adverse compared to the SAW eﬀect (tuned by K0) considering the

decrease of Recr.

2 Governing Equations

Macroscopically, the motion of the normal ﬂuid (above the critical phase transition temperature

of the quantum ﬂuids) as a whole could be treated by using hydrodynamical models starting

3

from the microscopic atomic wave function8,19. Here, after the simplifying treatment of the com-

plicated mathematical derivations, the dimensionless equations of motion for an incompressible
normal ﬂuid ﬂow8,10,11,18, in the absence of body forces and moments, reduce to

where U and P stand for the velocity and pressure of ﬂuids. Re = ρumaxh/µ is the Reynolds
number with ρ and µ being the density and viscosity of ﬂuids. For the case of normal ﬂuid ﬂows

driven by a constant pressure-gradient, i.e., plane Poiseuille ﬂow, the length scale is the half

width of the normal-ﬂuid layer h, and the velocity is the center-line velocity umax. Following the
usual assumptions of linearized stability theory10−11, Ui(xi, t) = ¯ui(xi) + u′
P (xi, t) = ¯p(xi) + p′(xi, t), the linearized equation, which governs the disturbances are:

be assumed to have the form ψ(x, y, t) = φ(y) exp[iα(x − Ct)], α is the wave number (real), C is

Cr + iCi. This is a kind of Tollmien-Schlichting transversal waves, Cr is the ratio between the

velocity of propagation of the wave of perturbation and the characteristic velocity, Ci is called
the ampliﬁcation factor, and α equals to 2πΛ−1, where Λ is the wave length of the Tollmien-
Schlichting perturbation10. Substituting the stream function and eliminating the pressure, we

have the linearized disturbance equation

(D2 − α2)(D2 − α2)φ = iαRe[(¯u − C)(D2 − α2)φ − (D2 ¯u)φ]

(3)

where D = d/dy. This is also valid for the slip ﬂow regime13, 0.001 < Kn ≤ 0.1, since the ﬂow

can still be considered as continuous.

2.1 Boundary Conditions

For the slip ﬂow, the continuous models can be used if the no-slip boundary condition is modiﬁed.
A few models have been suggested to estimate the nonzero velocity at a boundary surface13,16.

In this study, we adopt the approach based on Taylor’s expansion of the velocity around the

wall. Thus, the ﬁrst order approximation yields ¯u |wall= Knd¯u/dy (positive for the inner normal

as y ≡ n). Consequently, the mean (basic) velocity proﬁle is given by

¯u = 1 − y2 + 2Kn

(4)

for −1 ≤ y ≤ 1. Boundary conditions for φ or Dφ are not the same as previous no-slip approach,

i.e., φ(±1) = Dφ(±1) = 0 and shall be introduced below.

2.2 Interface Treatment

We consider a two-dimensional layer (slab) of uniform thickness ﬁlled with a homogeneous normal

ﬂuid (Newtonian viscous ﬂuid; its dynamics is described by Navier-Stokes equations). The upper

and lower boundaries of the layer are superﬂuids which are rather ﬂexible, on which are imposed

travelling sinusoidal waves of small amplitude a (due to SAW or peristaltic waves). The vertical

displacements of the upper and lower interfaces (y = h and −h) are thus presumed to be η and
−η, respectively, where η = a cos 2π

λ (x − ct), λ is the wave length, and c the wave speed. x and y
are Cartesian coordinates, with x measured in the direction of wave propagation and y measured

in the direction normal to the mean position of the interfaces. It would be expedient to simplify

these equations by introducing dimensionless variables. We have a characteristic velocity c and

three characteristic lengths a, λ, and h. The following variables based on c and h could thus be

After introducing the dimensionless variables, now, for the ease and direct representation of our

mathematical expressions in the following, we shall drop those primes (’) in those dimensionless

variables and treat them as dimensionless. We seek a solution in the form of a series in the

parameter ǫ :

with u = ∂ψ/∂y, v = −∂ψ/∂x. The 2D (x- and y-) momentum equations and the equation of

continuity for the normal ﬂuid could be in terms of the stream function ψ if the pressure (p)

term is eliminated. The ﬁnal governing equation is

and subscripts indicate the partial diﬀerentiation. If we presume originally the ﬂuid is quiescent;

this corresponds to a free pumping case and ﬁnally the velocity proﬁle of the ﬂuid is symmetric

with respect to the centerline of the plane channel bounded by the superﬂuids. Equation above,

together with the condition of symmetry and a uniform constant pressure-gradient in the x-

direction, (∂p/∂x)0=constant, yield :

where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. The normal ﬂuid is subjected to boundary

conditions imposed by the symmetric motion of the wavy interfaces and the slip condition at

interfaces. The basic slip ﬂow now has this form (cf [16]), as u = ∂ψ0/∂y,

¯u = 1 − y2 + 2Kn,

where c is the phase speed of the SAW, Kn=mfp/h. Boundary conditions become

φy(±1) ± φyy(±1)Kn = 2K0(1 ± Kn),

φ(±1) = ±1.

2.3 Numerical Approach

The eigenvalue problem raised above could be solved by using the veriﬁed code18, which used the
spectral method20 based on the Chebyshev-polynomial-expansion approach, once the equation

and boundary conditions are discretized. For instance, we have, from equation (3), as a ﬁnite-

After substituting φ into (3) and with tremendous manipulations, we obtain the algebraic equa-

for n ≥ 0, f = 1 + 2Kn, where cn = 0 if n > 0, and dn = 0 if n < 0, dn = 1 if n≥ 0. Here,

The matrices thus formed are of poor condition because they are not diagonal, symmetric21.

Thus, before we perform ﬂoating-point computations to get the complex eigenvalues, we pre-

condition these complex matrices to get less errors. Here we adapt Osborne’s algorithm to

precondition these complex matrices via rescaling, i.e., by certain diagonal similarity transfor-

mations of the matrix (errors are in terms of the Euclidean norm of the matrix) designed to

reduce its norm. The details of this algorithm could be traced in [18,21-22]. The form of the

reduced matrix is upper Hessenberg. Finally we perform the stabilized LR transformations

for these matrices to get the complex eigenvalues (please see also [18,22] for the details). The

preliminary veriﬁed results of this numerical code had been done for the cases of Kn=0 (no-slip
boundary conditions) in comparison with the bench-mark results of Orszag’s11 . For example,

for Re = 10000.0, α = 1.0 of the test case : plane Poiseuille ﬂow, we obtained the same spectra

as 0.23752648+ i 0.00373967 for Cr+ i Ci which Orszag obtained in 1971.

3 Results and Discussion

After careful veriﬁcation, we proceed to obtain (through tremendous searching using double-

precision machine accuracy) the detailed spectra for the illustration of the stability of the slip ﬂow

in normal ﬂuids conﬁned between wavy interfaces. To demonstrate some of the calculated spectra

(Cr, Ci) near the regime of (Recr, α), we plot Fig. 1 by selecting 2 pairs of (Re, α)=(1562, 1.156)

and (2982.3, 1.0783) with the corresponding K0= 1, and 0.5 for the same Knudsen number

(Kn=0.01). Once Ci > 0, the instability occurs! The onset of instability is easy to occur once

the Reynolds number, wave number, or Knudsen number perturb a little again near this regime

(Ci becomes zero and then positive).

We then plot the neutral stability boundary curves for diﬀerent cases in Fig. 2.

It is clear

that each curve is composed of two branches (one is upper and the other is lower, and they

coalesce into a critical point (Recr and αcr) as the Reynolds number decreases). We tune

the K0 parameter to be 1 and 0.5, with the corresponding Knudsen number being 0.001 and

0.01, respectively. Once the Knudsen number is set to be zero and there is no SAW eﬀect, we
recover the curve obtained by Orszag11 (Recr ∼ 5772). Otherwise, the resulting critical Reynolds

numbers (Recr) are 1441,1562, 2664, 2982.3, respectively. It seems the eﬀect of SAW propagating

along the interface is the dominated one and will degrade the ﬂow stability signiﬁcantly. The

slip velocity eﬀect is minor and adverse (delay the transition).

To understand the stability behavior related to the decay or ampliﬁcation of the perturbed

disturbance waves in the ﬁnite time for certain mode, we also illustrate their time evolution

patterns by selecting the least unstable mode. As illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 for Re=1441,

α = 1.175 (K0 = 1) and Re=2664, α = 1.105 (K0 = 0.5), we can observe the oscillating or

amplifying pattern just after a ﬁnite time (time is dimensionless and the Knudsen number is

the same, Kn=0.001). The original disturbance (wave) will not decay for these unstable modes

7

(Cr, Ci)∼ (0.382, 0.000002), and ∼ (0.324, 0.00000046), respectively.

We can ﬁnally conclude that various kinds of interface noises (as illustraed here, slip velocities

and the propagating surface acoustic wavs) will premature any instability mechanism considering

the temporal growth of the disturbances. We have obtained more clues about the slip ﬂow

(which is in a non-equilibrium state) instability of quantum ﬂuids (above their critical transition

temperature) by considering more realistic interface conditions. Once we know the viscosities

and/or densities of these quantum ﬂuids, based on the obtained critical Reynolds number, we
can then determine the critical velocity5,6 for each case. Meanwhile, these results will help

researchers to understand the formation or generation of vorticity waves and then the route to

low-temperature turbulence in quantum ﬂuids. It seems the range of wave numbers relevant

to the SAW propagating along the ﬂexible interfaces, the Knudsen numbers and the Reynolds

numbers of basic slip ﬂows of normal ﬂuids must be carefully selected for the optimal ﬂow control
usage in SAW applications1,2 to the investigation of 3He. Our further study will be relevant to
those more complicated issues 2−3,22−25.

Abstract

The time variation of the gravitational constant G in the recently
discussed large number cosmologies accounts for the galactic rotational
velocity curves without invoking dark matter and also for eﬀects like
the precession of the perhelion of Mercury.

In recent issues (Matthews, 1998), (Sidharth, 1999), the large number coin-
cides brought to light by Dirac a little over sixty years ago were revisited.
Cosmological schemes where these relations between the fundamental micro
physical constants and large scale parameters like the Hubble constant and
the number of particles in the universe are not mere magical or mysterious
coincidences were considered. Here, the universal constant for gravitation G
varies with time (Narlikar, 1993), (c.f. also ref. (Sidharth, 1999)),

G = Go(1 −

t
to

)

(1)

where to ∼ 1017secs is the present age of the universe and t is the time elapsed
from the present epoch. Subscripts refer to values at the present epoch.
From this it would also follow that the distance of an object moving under
the inﬂuence of a massive gravitating body would decrease with time as
(cf.ref.(Narlikar, 1993))

More accurately we have

r = ro(1 −

),

(There is also a variant of the above idea, called multiplicative creation of par-
ticles, under which the distances increase with time - cf.ref.(Narlikar, 1993)
for details.)
We now show that given (1), it is possible to explain the anomalies in galactic
rotational curves on the one hand and deduce eﬀects like the correct perhe-
lion precession of the planet Mercury on the other.
The problem of galactic rotational curves is well known (cf.ref.(Narlikar,
1993)). We would expect, on the basis of straightforward dymamics that
the rotational velocities at the edges of galaxies would fall oﬀ according to

On the contrary the velocities tend to a value,

v2 ≈

GM
r

v ∼ 300km/sec

This has lead to the postulation of as yet undetected dark matter, that is that
the galaxies are more massive than their visible material content indicates.
Our starting point is the well known equation for Keplerian orbits (Goldstein,
1966), which on use of (1) becomes

r

mko
l2 (1 + ecosΘ)(1 −

t

),

k = GmM, l = mr2 ˙Θ

M and m being respectively the masses of the central and orbiting objects
and e is the eccentricity. From (6) we could deduce

r3 ˙Θ2 = r3

˙Θ2

o(1 −

t

Equation (6), for the special case of closed orbits, e < 1 can be considered
to be the generalisation of Kepler’s third law.
From (2) it can be easily deduced that

a ≡ (¨r − ¨ro) = −

(t¨r + 2 ˙ro) ≈ −2β

as we are considering inﬁnitesimal intervals t and nearly circular orbits.
Equation (7) shows that there is an anomalous inward acceleration, as if
there is an extra attractive force, or an additional central mass.
While we recover the usual theory, in the limit β → 0, if we retain β then we
will have instead of the usual equation (3), in view of (7) and the fact that
β ≈ 1

From (8) it follows that

v ≈

From (9) it is easily seen that at distances within the edge of a typical galaxy,
that is r < 1023cms the equation (3) holds but as we reach the edge and be-
yond, that is for r ≥ 1024cms we have v ∼ 107cms per second, in agreement
with (4).
Thus the time variation of G given in equation (1) explains observation with-
out taking recourse to dark matter.
We now come to the case of the precession of Mercury’s perhelion. Indeed
using (2) in (6) we get

whence,

From (10) we can deduce

˙Θ = ˙Θo(1 +

λ(t) ≡ Θ − Θo =

where λ(t) is the average perhelion precession at time t and τo ≈ 0.25 years
the planet’s period of revolution. Summing over the years t = 1, 2, · · · , 100,
the total precession in a century is given by

the age of the universe to being taken ≈ 2 × 1010 years. This ofcourse is the
observed value.
Finally, it may be mentioned that several recent studies show that the uni-
verse is ever expanding (Perlmutter, 1998), which undermines the conven-
tional belief that dark matter closes the universe.

Abstract

The Michelson-Morley experiment was designed to detect the relative motion of the Earth

with respect to a preferred reference frame, the ether, by measuring the fringe shifts in an

optical interferometer. These shifts, that should have been proportional to the square of

the Earth’s velocity, were found to be much smaller than expected. As a consequence, that

experiment was taken as an evidence that there is no ether and, as such, played a crucial

role for deciding between Lorentzian Relativity and Einstein’s Special Relativity. However,

according to some authors, the observed Earth’s velocity was not negligibly small. To provide

an independent check, we have re-analyzed the fringe shifts observed in each of the six diﬀerent

sessions of the Michelson-Morley experiment. They are consistent with a non-zero observable

Earth’s velocity

±
Assuming the existence of a preferred reference frame and using Lorentz transformations,

vobs = 8.4

0.5 km/s.

this vobs corresponds to a real velocity, in the plane of the interferometer,

vearth = 201

12 km/s.

±

This value, which is remarkably consistent with 1932 Miller’s cosmic solution, suggests that

the magnitude of the fringe shifts is determined by the typical velocity of the solar system

within our galaxy. This conclusion is consistent with the results of all classical experiments

(Morley-Miller, Illingworth, Joos, Michelson-Pease-Pearson,...) and with the existing data

from present-day experiments.

1. The Michelson-Morley experiment [1] is generally believed to represent the proof that
the Earth’s absolute motion cannot be detected in a laboratory experiment. However, the

fringe shifts observed in the original experiment (and in the subsequent one of Morley and

Miller [2]) although smaller than the expected magnitude corresponding to the orbital motion

of the Earth, were not negligibly small. While this had already been pointed out by Hicks [3],

Miller’s reﬁned analysis of the half-period, second-harmonic eﬀect observed in the experimen-

tal fringe shifts showed that they were consistent with an eﬀective, observable velocity lying

in the range 7-10 km/s (see Fig.4 of Ref.[4]). For instance, the Michelson-Morley experiment

gave a value vobs

8.8 km/s for the noon observations and a value vobs

8.0 km/s for the

∼

evening observations.

∼

The aim of this paper is twofold. On one hand, for the convenience of the reader, we shall

explicitly illustrate some steps that are not immediately evident in the Michelson-Morley

original paper and re-calculate the values of vobs for their experiment.

On the other hand, by using Lorentz transformations, the small observed velocity will be

shown to correspond to a real Earth’s velocity, in the plane of the interferometer, vearth

200

km/s. This value, which is remarkably consistent with 1932 Miller’s cosmic solution [4],

suggests that the fringe shifts are determined by the typical velocity of the solar system

within our galaxy (and not, for instance, by its velocity vearth

336 km/s with respect to the

centroid of the Local Group). In this sense, this paper provides a consistent and self-contained

treatment of the Michelson-Morley type of experiments.

2. We have analyzed the original data obtained by Michelson and Morley in each of
the six diﬀerent sessions of their experiment. No form of inter-session averaging has been

performed. As discovered by Miller, in fact, inter-session averaging of the raw data may

produce misleading results. For instance, in the Morley-Miller data [2], the morning and

evening observations each were indicating an eﬀective velocity of about 7.5 km/s (see Fig.11

of Ref.[4]). This indication was completely lost with the wrong averaging procedure adopted

in Ref.[2]. The same point of view has been advocated by Munera in his recent re-analysis

of the classical experiments [5].

To obtain the fringe shifts of each session we have followed the well deﬁned procedure

adopted in the classical experiments as described in Miller’s paper [4]. Namely, starting from

the seventeen entries, say E(i), reported in the Michelson-Morley Table [1], one ﬁrst has to

correct for the diﬀerence E(1)

E(17) between the ﬁrst entry and the seventeenth entry

obtained after a complete rotation of the apparatus. In this way, assuming the linearity of

the correction eﬀect, one adds 15/16 of the correction to the 16th entry, 14/16 to the 15th

entry and so on, thus obtaining a set of 16 corrected entries

Ecorr(i) =

(E(1)

E(17)) + E(i)

Finally, the fringe shift is deﬁned from the diﬀerences between each of the corrected entries

Following Miller’s indications, we have included terms up to n = 5, although the results for
¯A2 are practically unchanged if one excludes from the ﬁt the terms with n = 4 and n = 5.
Our values of ¯A2 for each session are reported in Table 1.

The Fourier analysis allows to determine the azimuth of the ether-drift eﬀect, from the

phase φ2 of the second-harmonic component, and an observable velocity from the value of its

amplitude. To this end, we have used the basic relation of the experiment

2 ¯A2 =

where D is the length of each arm of the interferometer.

Notice that, as emphasized by Shankland et al. (see page 178 of Ref.[6]), it is the quantity
2 ¯A2, and not ¯A2 itself, that should be compared with the maximal displacement obtained for
rotations of the apparatus through 90o in its optical plane (see also Eqs.(23) and (24) below).
Notice also that the quantity 2 ¯A2 is denoted by d in Miller’s paper (see page 227 of Ref.[4]).
107 [1], it becomes convenient
to normalize the experimental values of ¯A2 to the classical prediction for an Earth’s velocity
of 30 km/s

Therefore, for the Michelson-Morley apparatus where D

Now, by inspection of Table 1, we ﬁnd that the average value of ¯A2 from the noon sessions,
¯A2 = 0.017
0.8 km/s and the average value from the
evening sessions, ¯A2 = 0.014

0.003, indicates a velocity vobs = 8.7

experiment provides an observable velocity

vobs = 8.4

0.5 km/s

±

(7)

This is also in agreement with the results obtained by Miller himself at Mt. Wilson. Dif-

ferently from the original Michelson-Morley experiment Miller’s data were taken over the

et al.

entire day and in four epochs of the year. However, after the critical re-analysis of Shankland
[6], it turns out that the average daily determinations of ¯A2 for the four epochs are
statistically consistent (see page 170 of Ref.[6]). In this case, if one takes the average of the
four daily determinations, ¯A2 = 0.044
the classical expectation for an Earth’s velocity of 30 km/s (see page 170 of Ref.[6]) and an

0.005, one obtains a value which is just

1/13 of

∼

±

eﬀective vobs which is exactly the same as in Eq.(7).

The problem with Miller’s analysis was to reconcile such low observable values of the

Earth’s velocity with those obtained from the daily variations of the magnitude and azimuth

of the ether-drift eﬀect with the sidereal time. In this way, in fact, on the base of the theory

exposed by Nassau and Morse [7], one can determine the apex of the motion of the solar

system. By requiring consistency among the four diﬀerent determinations obtained in the

four epochs of the year (see Fig.23 of Ref.[4]), Miller could restrict kinematically the cosmic

Earth’s velocity in the range 200-215 km/s (see page 233 of Ref.[4]) with the conclusion that

”...a velocity vearth

208 km/s for the cosmic component, gives the closest grouping of the

four independently determined locations of the cosmic apex”.

∼

At the same time, due to the particular magnitude and direction of the cosmic component,

Miller’s predictions for its projection in the plane of the interferometer had very similar values

(see Table V of Ref.[4]), say

vearth

(8)

Therefore, after Miller’s observations, the situation with the ether-drift experiments could be

summarized as follows (see page 236 of Ref.[4]). On one hand, ”the observed displacement

of the interference fringes, for some unexplained reason, corresponds to only a fraction of the

velocity of the Earth in space”. On the other hand, the theoretical solution of the Earth’s

cosmic motion involves only the relative values of the ether-drift eﬀect and ”..does not require

a knowledge of the cause of the reduction in the apparent velocity nor of the amount of

this reduction”. A check of this is that, after plugging the ﬁnal parameters of the cosmic

component in the Nassau-Morse expressions, ”..the calculated curves ﬁt the observations

remarkably well, considering the nature of the experiment” (see Figs. 26 and 27 of Ref.[4]).

3

In spite of this beautiful agreement, the unexplained large discrepancy between the typical

values of vobs, as given in Eq.(7), and the typical calculated values of vearth, as given in Eq.(8),

has been representing a very serious objection to the consistency of Miller’s analysis.

It has been recently pointed out, however, by Cahill and Kitto [8] that an eﬀective re-

duction of the Earth’s velocity from values vearth =

(102) km/s down to values vobs =

km/s can be understood by taking into account the eﬀects of the Lorentz contraction and of

In this way, the observations become consistent [8] with values of the Earth’s velocity

In Ref.[12] the argument has been completely reformulated by using Lorentz transforma-

of a factor √3. When properly taken into account, the Earth’s velocity extracted from the

absolute magnitude of the fringe shifts is not vearth

making Miller’s prediction Eq.(8) completely consistent with Eq.(7). For the convenience of

the reader, we shall report in the following the essential steps.

In this way, isotropy can be established at the level
level of accuracy, say 10−9, the only way to test isotropy is to perform a Michelson-Morley
type of experiment and look for fringe shifts upon rotation of the interferometer.

∼

Now, if one ﬁnds experimentally fringe shifts (and thus some non-zero anisotropy), one

can explore the possibility that this eﬀect is due to the Earth’s motion with respect to a
= S′. In this perspective, light would propagate isotropically with velocity

preferred frame Σ
as in Eq.(10) for Σ but not for S′.

Assuming this scenario, the degree of anisotropy for S′ can easily be determined by
using Lorentz transformations. By deﬁning v the velocity of S′ with respect to Σ one ﬁnds

length L′
P is taken along the direction of motion associated with the beam 1 while the arm
of length L′

Q lies along the direction of the beam 2.

In this way, the interference pattern, between the light beam coming out of the optical

path P and that coming out of the optical path Q, can easily be obtained from the relevant

delay time. By using the equivalent form of the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl parametrization

[14, 15] for the two-way speed of light deﬁned above in Eq.(15), this is given by

On the other hand, if the beam 2 were to propagate along the optical path P and the beam

in excellent agreement with the value Eq.(8) calculated by Miller.

Therefore, from this excellent agreement, we deduce that the magnitude of the fringe

shifts is determined by the typical velocity of the solar system within our galaxy and not, for

instance, by its velocity relatively to the centroid of the Local Group. In the latter case, one

would get higher values such as vearth

Notice that such ambiguity, say vearth

336 km/sec, see Ref.[16].

200, 300, 365, ... km/s, on the actual value of the

Earth’s velocity determining the fringe shifts, can only be resolved experimentally in view of

the many theoretical uncertainties in the operative deﬁnition of the preferred frame where

light propagates isotropically. At this stage, we believe, one should just concentrate on the

internal consistency of the various frameworks. In this sense, the analysis presented in this

paper shows that internal consistency is extremely high in Miller’s 1932 solution.

We are aware that our conclusion goes against the widely spread belief that Miller’s

results were only due to statistical ﬂuctuation and/or local temperature conditions (see the

Abstract of Ref.[6]). However, within the paper the same authors of Ref.[6] say that ”...there

can be little doubt that statistical ﬂuctuations alone cannot account for the periodic fringe

shifts observed by Miller” (see page 171 of Ref.[6]). In fact, although ”...there is obviously

considerable scatter in the data at each azimuth position,...the average values...show a marked

second harmonic eﬀect” (see page 171 of Ref.[6]). In any case, interpreting the observed eﬀects

on the base of the local temperature conditions cannot be the whole story since ”...we must

admit that a direct and general quantitative correlation between amplitude and phase of the

observed second harmonic on the one hand and the thermal conditions in the observation

hut on the other hand could not be established” (see page 175 of Ref.[6]). This rather

7

unsatisfactory explanation of the observed eﬀects should be compared with the previously

mentioned excellent agreement that was instead obtained by Miller once the ﬁnal parameters

for the Earth’s velocity were plugged in the theoretical predictions (see Figs.26 and 27 of

Ref.[4]).

This does not exclude the presence of some systematic eﬀect in the Miller’s data. In fact,

as mentioned above, Miller’s value ¯A2 = 0.044
only obtained after the critical re-analysis of Shankland et al. (see page 170 of Ref.[6]).

±

On the other hand, additional information on the validity of the Miller’s results can also be

obtained by other means, for instance comparing with the experiment performed by Michel-

son, Pease and Pearson [17]. These other authors in 1929, using their own interferometer,

again at Mt. Wilson, declared that their ”precautions taken to eliminate eﬀects of temper-

ature and ﬂexure disturbances were eﬀective”. Therefore, their statement that the fringe

shift, as derived from ”..the displacements observed at maximum and minimum at sidereal

times..”, was deﬁnitely smaller than ”...one-ﬁfteenth of that expected on the supposition of

an eﬀect due to a motion of the solar system of three hundred kilometres per second”, can

be taken as an indirect conﬁrmation of Miller’s results. Indeed, although the ”one-ﬁfteenth”

was actually a ”one-ﬁftieth” (see pag.240 of Ref.[4]), their fringe shifts were certainly non

negligible. This is easily understood since, for an in-air-operating interferometer, the fringe

shift (∆λ)class(300), expected on the base of classical physics for an Earth’s velocity of 300

km/s, is about 500 times bigger than the corresponding relativistic one

(∆λ)rel(300)

3kair (∆λ)class(300)

computed using Lorentz transformations (compare with Eqs.(21) and (22) for kair

0.00058). Therefore, the Michelson-Pease-Pearson upper bound

is actually equivalent to

(∆λ)obs < 0.02 (∆λ)class(300)

(∆λ)obs < 24 (∆λ)rel(208)

As such, it poses no strong restrictions and is entirely consistent with those typical low

eﬀective velocities detected by Miller in his observations of 1925-1926.

A similar agreement is obtained when comparing with the Illingworth’s data [10] as re-

cently re-analyzed by Munera [5]. In this case, using Eq.(22), from the observable velocity

vobs = 3.13

1.04 km/s [5] and the value Nhelium

The same conclusion applies to the Joos experiment [11]. His interferometer was placed

in an evacuated housing and he declared that the velocity of any ether wind had to be smaller

than 1.5 km/s. Although we don’t know the exact value of Nvacuum for the Joos experiment,

it is clear that this is the type of upper bound expected in this case. As an example, for

5. We shall conclude with a brief comparison with present-day, ‘vacuum’ Michelson-
Morley experiments of the type ﬁrst performed by Brillet and Hall [18] and more recently

by M¨uller et al.

[19].

In a perfect vacuum, by deﬁnition

vacuum = 1 so that vobs = 0

and no anisotropy can be detected. However, one can explore [13, 20] the possibility that,

N

even in this case, a very small anisotropy might be due to a refractive index

vacuum that

diﬀers from unity by an inﬁnitesimal amount. In this case, the natural candidate to explain

a value
frame S′ will locally measure the same speed of light as in an inertial frame in the absence
of any gravitational eﬀects. However, if S′ carries on board an heavy object this is no longer
true. For an observer placed on the Earth, this amounts to insert the Earth’s gravitational

potential in the weak-ﬁeld isotropic approximation to the line element of General Relativity

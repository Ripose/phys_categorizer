Abstract

The propositional logic is generalized on the real numbers ﬁeld.
The logical analog of the Bernoulli independent tests scheme is con-
structed. The variant of the nonstandard analysis is adopted for the
deﬁnition of the logical function, which has all properties of the classi-
cal probability function. The logical analog of the Large Number Law
is deduced from properties of this function.

1 INTRODUCTION

There is the evident nigh aﬃnity between the classical probability function
and the Boolean function of the classical propositional logic. These functions
are diﬀered by the range of value, only. That is if the range of values of
the Boolean function shall be expanded from the two-elements set {0; 1} to
the segment [0; 1] of the real numeric axis then the logical analog of the
Bernoulli Large Number Law [1] can be deduced from the logical axioms.
And if the range of values of such function shall be expanded to the segment
of some suitable variant of the hyperreal numeric axis then this theorem shall
insert some new nonstandard purport for the notion ”truth”. These topics
is considered in this article.

2 THE NONSTANDARD NUMBERS

Let us consider the set N of natural numbers.

Deﬁnition 2.1: The n-part-set S of N is deﬁned recursively as follows:
1) S1 = {1};
2) S(n+1) = Sn ∪ {n + 1}.
Deﬁnition 2.2: If Sn is the n-part-set of N and A ⊆ N then kA ∩ Snk

is the quantity elements of the set A ∩ Sn, and if

̟n (A) =

kA ∩ Snk
n

,

then ̟n (A) is the frequency of the set A on the n-part-set Sn.
Theorem 2.1:
1) ̟n(N) = 1;
2) ̟n(∅) = 0;
3) ̟n(A) + ̟n(N − A) = 1;
4) ̟n(A ∩ B) + ̟n(A ∩ (N − B)) = ̟n(A).
Deﬁnition 2.3: If ”lim” is the Cauchy-Weierstrass ”limit” then let us

denote:

Φix =

A ⊆ N| lim
n→∞

̟n(A) = 1

.

Theorem 2.2: Φix is the ﬁlter [2], i.e.:
1) N ∈ Φix,
2) ∅ /∈ Φix,
3) if A ∈ Φix and B ∈ Φix then (A ∩ B) ∈ Φix ;
4) if A ∈ Φix and A ⊆ B then B ∈ Φix.
In the following text we shall adopt to our topics the deﬁnitions and the

proofs of the Robinson Nonstandard Analysis [3]:

Deﬁnition 2.4: The sequences of the real numbers hrni and hsni are

Q-equivalent (denote: hrni ∼ hsni) if

{n ∈ N|rn = sn} ∈ Φix.

Theorem 2.3: If r,s,u are the sequences of the real numbers then
1) r ∼ r,
2) if r ∼ s then s ∼ r;
3) if r ∼ s and s ∼ u then r ∼ u.
Deﬁnition 2.5: The Q-number is the set of the Q-equivalent sequences
a, then

a is the Q-number and r ∈

r ∼ s; and if r ∈

In this case if hzi,ni ∼ hyi,ni then hf(y1,n, y2,n, y3,n)i ∼ hf(z1,n, z2,n, z3,n)i.

3 THE CLASSICAL LOGIC.

Deﬁnition 3.1: The sentence ≪ Θ ≫ is the true sentence if and only if Θ
1.

1Perhaps, the deﬁnition of the truth sentence belongs to A.Tarsky.

5

For example: the sentence ≪it rains≫ is the true sentence if and only if

Deﬁnition 3.2: The sentence ≪ Θ ≫ is the false sentence if and only if

Deﬁnition 3.3: The sentences A and B are equal (A = B) if A is true

Hereinafter we use the usual notions of the classical propositional logic

it rains.

it is not that Θ.

if and only if B is true.

[7].

Deﬁnition 3.4: The sentence C is the conjunction of the sentences A

and B (C = (A ∧ B)) , if C is true if and only if A is true and B is true.

Deﬁnition 3.5: The sentence C is the negation of the sentence A (

C = A), if C is true if and only if A is false.

Theorem 3.1:
1) (A ∧ A) = A;
2) (A ∧ B) = (B ∧ A);
3) (A ∧ (B ∧ C)) = ((A ∧ B) ∧ C);
4) if T is the true sentence then for every sentence A: (A ∧ T ) = A.
Deﬁnition 3.6: Each function g, which has got the domain in the set of
the sentences, has got the range of values on the two-elements set {0; 1}, is
the Boolean function if:

= 1− g (A);

1) for every sentence A: g
A
2) for all sentences A and B: g (A ∧ B) = g (A) · g (B).
(cid:0)
Deﬁnition 3.7: The set ℑ of the sentences is the basic set if for every
element A of this set the Boolean functions g1 and g2 exist, for which the
following conditions fulﬁll:
1) g1 (A) 6= g2 (A);
2) for each element B of ℑ: if B 6= A then g1 (B) = g2 (B).
Deﬁnition 3.8: The set [ℑ] of the sentences is the propositional closure

(cid:1)

of the set ℑ if the following conditions fulﬁll:

1) if A ∈ ℑ then A ∈ ℑ;
2) if A ∈ ℑ and B ∈ ℑ then (A ∧ B) ∈ ℑ.
In the following text the elements of [ℑ] are denoted as the ℑ-sentences.
Deﬁnition 3.9: The ℑ-sentence A is the tautology if for all Boolean

functions g:

g(A) = 1.

usual way:

(cid:1)
(cid:1)

(A ⇒ B) is the false sentence if and if, only, A is the true sentence and

is the false sentence.

B is the false sentence.

Deﬁnition 3.11: A ℑ-sentence is a propositional axiom [8] if this se-

quence has got one some amongst the following forms:

A1. (A ⇒ (B ⇒ A));
A2. ((A ⇒ (B ⇒ C)) ⇒ ((A ⇒ B) ⇒ (A ⇒ C)));

Deﬁnition 3.13:

[9] The array A1, A2, . . . , An of the sentences is the
propositional deduction of the sentence A from the hypothesis list Γ (denote:
Γ ⊢ A), if An = A and for all numbers l (1 ≤ l ≤ n): Al is either the
propositional axiom or Al is obtained from some sentences Al−k and Al−s by
the modus ponens or Al ∈ Γ.

Deﬁnition 3.14: The sentence is the propositional proved sentence if
this sentence is the propositional axiom or this sentence is obtained from the
propositional proved sentences by the modus ponens.

Hence, if A is the propositional proved sentence then the propositional

deduction

exists.

4 B-FUNCTIONS

Deﬁnition 4.1: Each function b (x), which has got the domain in the sen-
tences set, has got the range of values on the numeric axis segment [0; 1],
is named as the B-function if for every sentences A and B the following
condition fulﬁlls:

b (A ∧ B) + b

A ∧ B

= b (A) .

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Theorem 4.1: For each B-function b:
1) for every sentences A and B: b (A ∧ B) ≤ b (A);
2) for every sentence A: if T is the true sentence, then b (A) + bA = b (T )
3) for every sentence A: if T is the true sentence, then b (A) ≤ b (T );
Therefore, if the sentence C exists, for which: b (C) = 1, and T is the

true sentence, then

Hence, in this case for every sentence A:

b (T ) = 1.

b (A) + b

A

= 1.

Theorem 4.2: If the sentence D is the propositional proved sentence
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

then for all B-functions b: b (D) = 1.

Theorem 4.3:
1) If for all Boolean functions g:

then for all B-functions b:

2) If for all Boolean functions g:

then for all B-functions b:

g (A) = 1

b (A) = 1.

g (A) = 0

b (A) = 0.

Theorem 4.4: All Boolean functions are the B-functions.
Hence, the B-function is the generalization of the logic Boolean

function. Therefore, the B-function is the logic function, too.

Theorem 4.5:

b (A ∨ B) = b (A) + b (B) − b (A ∧ B) .

Deﬁnition 4.2: The sentences A and B are the inconsistent sentences

for the B-function b if

for the B-function b then

5 THE INDEPENDENT TESTS

(cid:1)

Deﬁnition 5.1: Let st(n) be a function, which has got the domain on the
set of natural numbers and has got the range of values in the set of the
ℑ-sentences.

In this case, the ℑ-sentence A is the [st]-series of the range r with the V-
number k if A, r and k fulﬁll to some one amongst the following conditions:

1) r = 1 and k = 1, A = st (1) or k = 0, A = st (1);
2) B is the [st]-series of the range r − 1 with the V-number k − 1 and

or B is the [st]-series of the range r − 1 with the V-number k and

Let us denote the set of the [st]-series of the range r with the V-number

k as [st](r, k).

A = (B ∧ st (r)) ,

A =

B ∧ st (r)

Deﬁnition 5.3:.Let st(n) be a function, which has got the domain on

In this case the sentence A is the [st]-disjunction of the range r with the
t[st](r, k)) if A is the disjunction of all elements of

V-number k (denote:
[st](r, k).

For example, if st (n) is the sentence Cn then:

Theorem 5.1: (the J.Bernoulli formula [12]) If st(n) is independent

Deﬁnition 5.5: Let st(n) be a function, which has got the domain on
the set of the natural numbers and has got the range of values in the set of
the ℑ-sentences.

10

In this case the function T[st](r, k, l), which has got the domain in the set
of threes of the natural numbers and has got the range of values in the set
of the ℑ-sentences, is deﬁned recursively as follows:

1) T[st](r, k, k) = t[st](r, k),
2) T[st](r, k, l + 1) = (T[st](r, k, l) ∨ t[st](r, l + 1)).
Deﬁnition 5.6: If a and b are a real numbers and k − 1 < a ≤ k and

l ≤ b < l + 1 then T[st](r, a, b) = T[st](r, k, l).

Theorem 5.2: If νr [st] (A) is the frequency of the sentence A in the

For example:
Certain raﬄe is kept one million raﬄe tickets. The Big prize falls to the

single ticket of this raﬄe. All tickets are sold. You have got one ticket.

In this case, the sentence ”You shall not win the Big prize” is the almost
authentic sentence because it is real that you shall not win the Big prize.
But the sentence ”Someone will win the Big prize.” is the true sentence by
the Deﬁnition 3.1.

Hence, all true sentences are the almost authentic sentences, but not all

almost authentic sentences are the true sentences.

Therefore, the function, deﬁned by the Deﬁnition 6.8 has got the

7 RESUME

The probability function is the extension of the logic B-function. Therefore,
the probability is some generalization of the classic propositional
logic.

8 APPENDIX I. Consistency

Let us deﬁne the propositional calculus like to ([7]), but the propositional
forms shall be marked by the script greek letters.

Deﬁnition C1: A set ℜ of the propositional forms is a U-world if:
1) if α1, α2, . . . , αn ∈ ℜ and α1, α2, . . . , αn ⊢ β then β ∈ ℜ,
2) for all propositional forms α: it is not that (α& (¬α)) ∈ ℜ,
3) for every propositional form α: α ∈ ℜ or (¬α) ∈ ℜ.
Deﬁnition C2: The sequences of the propositional forms hαni and hβni

are Q-equivalent (denote: hαni ∼ hβni) if

{n ∈ N|αn ≡ βn} ∈ Φix.

Let us deﬁne the notions of the Q-forms and the Q-extension of the func-
tions for the propositional forms like as in the Deﬁnitions 2.5, 6.2, 2.9, 6.5,
6.6.

Deﬁnition C3: The Q-form

α is Q-real in the U-world ℜ if the sequence

hαni of the propositional forms exists, for which: hαni ∈

α and

e

{n ∈ N|αn ∈ ℜ} ∈ Φix.

Deﬁnition C4: The set

Theorem C1: If A is the regular set and for all real positive ε:

|wn(A) − wm(A)| < ε.

{k ∈ N|wk(A) < ε} ∈ Φix.

then

Proof of theTheorem C1: Let be

lim
k→∞

wk(A) = 0.

lim
k→∞

wk(A) 6= 0.

That is the real number ε0 exists, for which: for every natural number n′

the natural number n exists, for which:

n > n′ and wn(A) > ε0.

Let δ0 be some positive real number, for which: ε0 − δ0 > 0. Because A
is the regular set then for δ0 the natural number n0 exists, for which: for all
natural numbers n and m, which are more or equal to n0:

That is

|wm(A) − wn(A)| < δ0.

wm(A) > wn(A) − δ0.

Since wn(A) ≥ ε0 then wm(A) ≥ ε0 − δ0.
Hence, the natural number n0 exists, for which: for all natural numbers

m: if m ≥ n0 then wm(A) ≥ ε0 − δ0.

Therefore,

{m ∈ N|wm(A) ≥ ε0 − δ0} ∈ Φix.

and by this Theorem condition:

15

Hence,

{k ∈ N|wk(A) < ε0 − δ0} ∈ Φix.

{k ∈ N|ε0 − δ0 < ε0 − δ0} ∈ Φix.

That is ∅ /∈ Φix. It is the contradiction for the Theorem 2.2.
Deﬁnition C8: Let

In this case the function W(

the Q-forms, has got the range of values in QR, is deﬁned as the following:

obvious.

Proof of the Theorem 2.4: Let us denote:
if k = 1 or k = 2 or k = 3 then

Ak = {n ∈ N|yk,n = zk,n} .

In this case by Deﬁnition 2.4 for all k:

17

Proof of the Theorem 2.3: By Deﬁnition 2.4 from the Theorem 2.2 is

Because

then by Theorem 2.2:

(A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3) ⊆ {n ∈ N|f(y1,n, y2,n, y3,n) = f(z1,n, z2,n, z3,n)} ,

{n ∈ N|f(y1,n, y2,n, y3,n) = f(z1,n, z2,n, z3,n)} ∈ Φix.

Proof of the Theorem 2.5: If hrni ∈

{n ∈ N|rn = a} ∈ Φix,
{n ∈ N|sn = b} ∈ Φix,
{n ∈ N|un = c} ∈ Φix,
{n ∈ N|tn = d} ∈ Φix.

1) Let d = f(a, b, c).
In this case by Theorem 2.2:

{n ∈ N|tn = f(rn, sn, un)} ∈ Φix.

Hence, by Deﬁnition 2.4:

Therefore by Deﬁnition 2.5:

htni ∼ hf(rn, sn, un)i .

hf(rn, sn, un)i ∈

Therefore, by Deﬁnition 2.4:

{n ∈ N|tn = f(rn, sn, un)} ∈ Φix.

Hence, by the Theorem 2.2:

{n ∈ N|tn = f(rn, sn, un), rn = a, sn = b, un = c, tn = d} ∈ Φix.

Hence, since this set does not empty, then

htni ∼ hf(xn, wn)i .

In this case by the Deﬁnition 5.4:

that for each real positive number ε:

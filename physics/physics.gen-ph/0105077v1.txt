Abstract

∼ r0 = e2/mc2 ≈ 2.8 × 10

−13 cm)
The region very close to an electron (r <
is, according to quantum electrodynamics, a seething maelstrom of virtual
electron-positron pairs ﬂashing in and out of existence. To take account
of this well-established physical reality, a phenomenological representa-
tion for vacuum polarization is introduced into the framework of classical
electrodynamics. Such a model enables a consistent picture of classical
point charges with ﬁnite electromagnetic self-energy. It is further conjec-
tured that the reaction of a point charge to its own electromagnetic ﬁeld is
tantamount to interaction with its vacuum polarization charge or “aura.”
This leads to a modiﬁcation of the Lorentz-Dirac equation for the force
on an accelerating electron, a new diﬀerential-diﬀerence equation which
avoids the pathologies of preacceleration and runaway solutions.

1 Introduction

The singularities in ﬁelds and energies associated with point charges in classi-
cal electrodynamics has been a pervasive ﬂaw in what has been an otherwise
beautifully complete and consistent theory. An immense number of attempts
to address this problem have been based, roughly speaking, on one of the fol-
lowing lines of argument: (1) Actual point charges do not exist—real particles
have a ﬁnite size—hence the problem is artiﬁcial; (2) By a clever limiting pro-
cedure in the formalism, the radius of a charge can be reduced to zero without
introducing inﬁnities; (3) Point charges are quantum objects and classical elec-
trodynamics has no business dealing with them. The last point of view, espoused
by Frenkel[1] and others, asserts that any classical model is futile because the
electron is a quantum-mechanical object with no substructure. It is nonethe-
less of at least academic interest to have a consistent classical relativistic model
which connects to macroscopic electrodynamics, while remaining cognizant of
its limitations. The purpose of the present paper is a modiﬁed theory able to
handle the singularities produced by point charges while reducing to standard
electrodynamics for r ≫ r0.

We propose to provide possible ﬁnishing touches to Maxwell’s electromag-
netism without making any ad hoc modiﬁcations of the fundamental equations
of the theory. The key to our approach is the physical reality of vacuum po-
larization in the submicroscopic vicinity of charged elementary particles. We
begin therefore with a review of the problem in the context of particle physics.

2 Structure of the Electron

Since the discovery of the electron by J. J. Thomson a century ago, the structure
of “the ﬁrst elementary particle” has been the subject of extensive theoretical
contemplation by some of the leading ﬁgures of 20th Century physics[2]. The
earliest models (Thomson, Poincar´e, Lorentz, Abraham, Schott)[3] pictured the
electron as a ﬁnite charged sphere, on the scale of the classical electron radius
r0 = e2/mc2 ≈ 2.818 × 10−13 cm. The electromagnetic self energy of such a
ﬁnite structure would be of the order of W ≈ e2/r0 ≈ mc2 and thus implies an
electron rest mass predominantly electromagnetic in origin.

Yet all experimental evidence implies an electron radius much smaller than
r0, consistent, in fact, with a particle of point mass and point charge[4]. Recent
results of high-energy electron-positron scattering[5] imply an upper limit of
2 × 10−16 cm on the electron size.

A number of ingeneous schemes to avoid a divergent electromagnetic self-
energy for a point electron have been proposed over the years by Dirac[6],
Wheeler and Feynman[7], Rohrlich[8], Teitelboim[9] and many others. The
more recent approaches invoke such arcana as advanced solutions of Maxwell’s
equations (superposed on the conventional retarded solutions) and/or renor-
malization of mass and charge inﬁnities. This enables the divergent part of
the self-interaction to be avoided while leaving intact the radiation reaction, an
eﬀect long known and thoroughly tested.

We will proceed on the premise that the electron rest mass (0.511 MeV/c2)
is totally electromagnetic, which was the original idea of Lorentz and Abra-
ham (see, however, Section 5). This is consistent with the (nearly!) zero rest
mass of the electron’s uncharged weak isodoublet partner—the neutrino—and
with order of magnitude of the neutron-proton mass diﬀerence (1.29 MeV/c2).
There is no need to invoke any non-electromagnetic forces within the electron—
collectively known as Poincar´e stresses. It should be noted that theories have
been proposed with counterbalancing gravitational ﬁelds[10] but these have been
regarded with disfavor by Einstein[11] among others.

3 Stationary Point Charge

The energy of an electromagnetic ﬁeld in a rest frame is given by

The ﬁeld produced by a point charge e in vacuum has D = E = e/r2 and

It was suggested a long time ago by Furry and Oppenheimer[12] that quan-
tum-electrodynamic eﬀects could give the vacuum some characteristics of a po-
larizable medium, which Weisskopf[13] represented phenomenologically by an
inhomogeneous dielectric constant, viz

Accordingly,

Remarkably, the functional form of ǫ(r) need not be further speciﬁed, provided
only that it satisﬁes the limiting conditions

ǫ(∞) = 1

and

ǫ(0) = ∞

Maxwell’s ﬁrst equation ∇ · E = 4π̺ applied to the electric ﬁeld

determines the charge density

E =

polarization densities. This function is appropriately normalized since

An explicit functional form for ǫ(r) does follow if it is conjectured that the net

It should be emphasized for the beneﬁt of QED theorists who might be
reading this that our use of the term “vacuum polarization” is intended only
in a classical phenomenological context. The leading contribution to vacuum
polarization in real life comes from the interaction of the electron with the

(11)

transverse radiation ﬁeld, which does not enter in our model. We are thereby
overlooking additional self-energy contributions arising from ﬂuctuations in the
vacuum radiation ﬁeld. Accordingly, our representation of vacuum polarization
is not to be compared with QED computations.

Somewhat of a rationalization for the functional form of ǫ(r) is suggested by
Debye-H¨uckel theory for ionic solutions and plasmas. The dielectric constant
depends on a Boltzmann factor e−E/kT . If in place of the average thermal energy
kT , we substitute the relativistic energy of pair formation 2mc2, regarding the
vacuum as an eﬀective thermal reservior, then Eq (11) follows with E = e2/r.

An explicit expression for the charge density follows by substituting (11)

into (8):

Since ρfree(r) = eδ(r), the density from vacuum polarization must equal

ρ(r) =

er0

8πr4 e−r0/2r

ρVP(r) =

−r0/2r − eδ(r)

er0
8πr4 e

According to this model, the free point charge is exactly cancelled by the delta-
function term of the polarization charge. The corresponding electrostatic po-
tential is given by

Φ(r) =

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

when

r0 → 0
or

(

This implies a deviation from Coulomb’s law of the same magnitude as the ﬁne
structure in atoms, but totally negligible on a macroscopic scale. An alternative
evaluation of the electromagnetic self-energy follows from transformation of Eq
(1) as follows:

using

W =

and assuming the requisite vanishing of integrands at inﬁnity. Thus

in agreement with the previous result, and further justiﬁcation for the conjec-
tured functional form of ǫ(r).

The preceding result suggests that the self-interaction of an electron is in
some sense equivalent to the interaction between a point charge and its net
polarization density—which we will denote as its “aura” (in New Age jargon,
an energy ﬁeld which emanates from a body). In the following section, we will
utilize this picture to derive the radiation reaction for an accelerated charge.

4 Accelerating Point Charge

The Lorentz-Dirac equation for the force on an accelerating electron is given
by[6]

ext = maλ −

1
c2 a2vλ

2 e2
3 c3
However, this equation has fallen into disfavor in recent years because it ad-
mits pathological solutions, including preacceleration and runaway behavior[14].
Such unphysical behavior is the result of taking the limit of the electron radius
to zero. It can be avoided by treating the electron as a ﬁnite charged sphere,
leading to a diﬀerential-diﬀerence equation without such pathology[15]. Our
picture of the electron as a point charge interacting with its aura provides such
an extended structure in a physically natural way.

(18)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

The conﬁguration of the aura surrounding an accelerating electron is most
likely quite complicated. At the very least, the aura is distorted from its original
spherical symmetry by Lorentz contraction. In addition, complicated processes
involving creation and relaxation of vacuum polarization in the vicinity of the
accelerating electron are certain to be occurring. We shall assume a highly
idealized model for the aura, treating it as a point charge trailing the electron
at a distance R∗ with a proper-time delay τ ∗. Analogously, the simplest model
for an ionic crystal idealizes a lattice consisting of point charges. We will work
in covariant notation throughout, thus avoiding the “4/3 problem” and other
relativistic pitfalls. The Li´enard-Wiechert 4-potential for a moving point charge
is given by

Aλ(x) = e

Four-dimensional scalar products are expressed a · b = aµbµ = a0b0 − a · b
(“West Coast metric”). The relevant variables are

Rλ = (R, R),

vλ = (γc, γv),

dτ

R is the displacement from the charge at the retarded time to the ﬁeld point
at the present time. Thus Rλ, lying on the light cone, is a null 4-vector with
RµRµ = 0. We will also require the relations

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

˙aλ =

daλ
dτ

,

vµvµ = c2,

vµaµ = 0

(22)

We picture the point charge representing the aura to be chasing the electron
along the same trajectory, with an eﬀective time delay τ ∗ relative to the proper
time τ . Additionally, let the displacement Rλ produced during the time τ ∗ be
parametrized as

Rλ =

[vλ]ret
c
in terms of an eﬀective separation R∗ between the electron and its aura (not nec-
essarily to the center of the aura). The parameters τ ∗ and R∗ are independent
and Rλ is no longer restricted to the light cone since RλRλ = R∗2 6≡ 0.

Substituting (23) into (20), noting that v · R = c R∗ and writing τ − τ ∗ for

R∗

(23)

the retarded time, we obtain a major simpliﬁcation to

F λµ(τ ) =

e
c3R∗ [vλaµ − vµaλ]τ −τ ∗

According to Lorentz and Abraham, if the electron is a purely electromagnetic
entity, the self force should exactly balance the external force. Thus

F λ

ext(τ ) = −F λ

self (τ ) = −

F λµ(τ )vµ(τ )

e
c

We obtain thereby a diﬀerential-diﬀerence equation for the force on an acceler-
ating electron:

F λ

ext(τ ) =

e2
c4R∗ [aλvµ − aµvλ]τ −τ ∗ vµ(τ )

The values of R∗ and τ ∗ can be inferred by considering the nonrelativistic
limit, as v and τ ∗ approach zero. Expanding [vλ] and [aλ] and doing the
summations over µ, we obtain

F λ

ext ≈

e2
c2 R∗ aλ −

e2 τ ∗
c4 R∗ ˙aλ

Since this should reduce to the original Abraham-Lorentz equation[16]

(as well as Newton’s second law when τ ∗ = 0) we can identify

the classical electron radius, and

Remarkably, the parameter τ0 ≈ 6.26 × 10−24 sec is the same “relaxation time”
that occurs in the integration of the Lorentz-Dirac equation—the immeasurably
brief time interval during which classical acausal behavior is tolerated.

Fext ≈ m a −

R∗ =

mc2 ≡ r0,

τ ∗ =

3mc3 ≡ τ0

Finally, writing βλ = vλ/c, we obtain a compact diﬀerential-diﬀerence for-

mulation for the force on an accelerating electron:

F λ

ext(τ ) = m [aλβµ − aµβλ]τ −τ0 βµ(τ )

(31)

Expansion of the bracketed quantity for small τ0 reacquires the conventional
Lorentz-Dirac equation:

ext = maλ −

˙aλ +

c2 a2vλ

(cid:19)

+ O(τ0)

(32)

noting that ˙aµvµ = −aµaµ = −a2.

The nonoccurrence of runaway solutions to the modiﬁed Lorentz-Dirac equa-

tion (31) is easy to prove. In the absence of external forces,

(33)

(34)

(36)

[aλvµ − aµvλ]τ −τ0 vµ(τ ) = 0

Premultiplying by vλ(τ − τ0) and summing, we obtain

aµ(τ − τ0)vµ(τ ) = 0

Writing out the components explicitly, using Eq (21),

[γ4 a · v/c]τ −τ0 γc − [γ2 a + γ4 (a · v) v/c2]τ −τ0 · γv(τ ) = 0

(35)

Clearly, if v is not identically zero for all τ , then a = 0. But if v = 0 for all
τ , then a = 0 again. Thus the only solutions for zero external force have zero
acceleration. Further, the absence of preacceleration is strongly implied by the
dependence on no time variables other than τ and τ − τ0. By contrast, the
Lorentz-Dirac equation (18) contains the derivative of acceleration, which can
be approximated by the ﬁnite diﬀerence

˙aλ(τ ) ≈

1
2τ0

aλ

τ +τ0
τ −τ0

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

with the possibility of preacceleration attributed to the occurrence of the time
variable τ + τ0. Note that the occurrence or absence of preacceleration can not
be readily discerned from the expanded form (32) of the L-D equation.

5 Non-Electromagnetic Mass

Although we have emphasized the case of a charged particle with purely elec-
tromagnetic self energy, the treatment can easily be generalized to include non-
electromagnetic contributions to mass. In place of m in all preceding formulas,
substitute mEM. For example, r0 = e2/mEMc2. The total self-energy can now
be written

W = mtotalc2 = (mbare + mEM)c2

(37)

This might pertain to elementary charged particles such as the muon, tauon,
quarks and W bosons—and possibly even to the electron if one accepts, for
example, the QED computation[17] giving

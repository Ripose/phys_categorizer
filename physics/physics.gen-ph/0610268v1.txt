The mystery that the real scalar Klein-Gordon ﬁeld has vanishing current densities is resolved.
The scalar ﬁeld is shown to be a complex ﬁeld due to the condition of possessing a proper non-
relativistic limit. Like the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld, one component complex Klein-Gordon ﬁeld corresponds
to a boson with one ﬂavor, and therefore there exists no physical real scalar ﬁeld. As a good example,
we present the Schwinger model Hamiltonian which is naturally described by the complex scalar
ﬁeld with one ﬂavor. The non-existence of the real scalar ﬁeld indicates that the Higgs mechanism
should be reconsidered.

INTRODUCTION

II. KLEIN-GORDON FIELD

The Klein-Gordon equation has a history of 80 years,
and has been repeatedly discussed since it contains some
basic problems. The Klein-Gordon equation can be writ-
ten for the scalar ﬁeld φ(x) with its mass m as

∂2
∂t2 − ∇

(cid:18)

2 + m2

φ(x) = 0

(cid:19)

(1.1)

where we denote x = (t, r). The scalar ﬁeld φ has only
one component, and therefore it is believed to describe
the spinless particle. The Lagrangian density which re-
produces eq.(1.1) can be written as

where Π(x) is deﬁned as Π(x) = ˙φ(x).
In the present
days, most of the ﬁeld theory textbooks state that the
real scalar ﬁeld has vanishing current density, but if one
quantizes the real scalar ﬁeld, then it can be interpreted
as the charge zero boson and therefore the zero current
density problem may be resolved. Further, if the scalar
ﬁeld is complex, then it should correspond to the charged
bosons like the π± mesons. This is the standard under-
standing of the real scalar ﬁeld.

However, there are basically two serious defects in the
real scalar ﬁeld solution in the Klein-Gordon equation.
Zero current density and no non-relativistic limit.
In
this respect, the real scalar ﬁeld is just like a ghost ﬁeld,
but it has been accepted as a physical particle and is
indeed treated in most of the standard textbooks since it
is simple in mathematics.

Here, we examine whether a real scalar ﬁeld can exist
as a physical observable or not in the Klein-Gordon equa-
tion. Normally, we ﬁnd that pion with the positive charge
is an anti-particle of pion with the negative charge. This
can be easily understood if we look into the structure of
the pion in terms of quarks. π± are indeed anti-particle
to each other by changing quarks into anti-quarks. Since
pion is not an elementary particle, their dynamics must
be governed by the complicated quark dynamics. Under
some drastic approximations, the motion of pion may be
governed by the Klein-Gordon equation.

A. Physical Scalar Field

It looks that eq.(1.1) contains the negative energy
state. However, one sees that eq.(1.1) is only one com-
ponent equation and, therefore the eigenvalue of E2 can
be obtained as a physical observable. There is no infor-
mation from the Klein-Gordon equation for the energy
E itself, but only E2 as we see it below,
φ = E2φ.

∇2 + m2

(cid:1)
In this case, the solution of eq.(2.1) should be described
just in the same way as the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld

(cid:0)

−

φk(x) = A(t)eik·r

(2.2)

which should be an eigenfunction of the momentum op-
i∇. The coeﬃcient A(t) can be determined
erator ˆp =
by putting eq.(2.2) into eq.(1.1). One can easily ﬁnd that
A(t) should be written as

−

A(t) =

ake−iωkt

1
√V ωk

where ak is a constant, and ωk is given as

ωk =

k2 + m2.

p

The shape of A(t) in eq.(2.3) can be also determined from
the Lorentz invariance. Now, one sees that eq.(2.2) has
a right non-relativistic limit. This is indeed a physical
scalar ﬁeld solution of the Klein-Gordon equation.

Now, we discuss the current density of the Klein-
Gordon ﬁeld which is obtained in terms of the Noether
current as

Pions and ρ

mesons are composed of quark and anti-
quark ﬁelds. Suppressing the isospin variables, we can de-
scribe the boson ﬁelds in terms of the Dirac ﬁeld ψq(x)χ 1
only with the large components, for simplicity

1. Classical Real Scalar Field

(2.5)

(2.6)

The current density of a real scalar ﬁeld vanishes to
zero. This can be easily seen since the real scalar ﬁeld
φ(x) should satisfy

φ†(x) = φ(x).

(2.7)

Since the φ(x) is still a classical ﬁeld, it is easy to see
that the current densities of ρ(x) and j(x) vanish to zero

ρ(x) = 0,

j(x) = 0.

(2.8)

This means that there is no ﬂow of the real scalar ﬁeld, at
least, classically. This is clear since a real wave function
in the Schr¨odinger equation cannot propagate. There-
fore, the condition that the scalar ﬁeld should be a real
ﬁeld must be physically too strong. In the Schr¨odinger
ﬁeld, one cannot require that the ﬁeld should be real. In
fact, if one assumes that the ﬁeld is real, then one ob-
tains that the total energy of the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld must
vanish, and the ﬁeld becomes unphysical [1].

Further, if the ﬁeld is quantized, then the current den-

sity becomes inﬁnity as shown in ref. [2].

2. Physical Scalar Field

The physical scalar ﬁeld can be written as in eqs.(2.2)

and (2.3)

φ(x) =

1
√V ωk

Xk

akeik·r−iωkt.

(2.11)

x2, X = 1

where x = x1 −
de-
notes the anti-particle ﬁeld and ξs,sz is the spin wave
function of the boson. Φ(Rel)(x) denotes the internal
structure of the boson and Φ(CM)(X) corresponds to
the boson ﬁeld. Now, it is clear that the boson ﬁeld
Φ(CM)(X) is a complex ﬁeld.

2

In the ﬁeld theory textbooks, the real scalar ﬁeld is
interpreted as a boson with zero charge. But this is not
the right interpretation. The charge is a property of the
ﬁeld in units of the coupling constant. The positive and
negative charges are connected to the ﬂavor of the scalar
ﬁelds. For example, a chargeless Schr¨odinger ﬁeld, of
course, has a ﬁnite current density of ρ(r). The charge
ρ(r)d3r
Q of the Schr¨odinger ﬁeld is given as Q = e0
and for the chargeless ﬁeld, we simply have e0 = 0, which
means that it does not interact with the electromagnetic
ﬁeld due to the absence of the coupling constant.

D. Gauge Field

The electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ is a real vector ﬁeld which
is required from the Maxwell equation, and therefore it
has zero current density. However, the gauge ﬁeld itself is
gauge dependent and therefore it is not directly a physical
observable. In this case, the energy ﬂow in terms of the
Poynting vector becomes a physical quantity. After the
gauge ﬁxing and the ﬁeld quantization, the vector ﬁeld
ˆA(x) can be written as

In this case, we can calculate the current density for the
scalar ﬁeld with the ﬁxed momentum of k and obtain

which is the eigenstate of the momentum operator ˆp =
i∇. In this respect, the gauge ﬁeld Aµ is completely
−
diﬀerent from the Klein-Gordon scalar ﬁeld. Naturally,
the gauge ﬁeld does not have any corresponding non-
relativistic ﬁeld.

III. BOSON IN THE SCHWINGER MODEL

There is a good example of the physical boson which
is described in terms of the fermion operators in the
Schwinger model.
Since the boson in the Schwinger
model is described in terms of the physical quantities, we
can learn the essence of the physical boson how nature
makes up a boson. Also, we learn the ﬁeld quantization
procedure of the boson ﬁelds.

A. Schwinger model

Here, we ﬁrst describe brieﬂy the Schwinger model
which is a two dimensional QED with massless fermion.
Its Lagrangian density can be written as [3]

= ¯ψiγµDµψ

Fµν F µν

(3.1)

L

−

where

Dµ = ∂µ + igAµ, Fµν = ∂µAν

∂νAµ.

(3.2)

−

Here, Aµ denotes the vector potential in two dimensions.
By taking the Coulomb gauge ﬁxing ∂1A1 = 0, we can
describe the Hamiltonian of massless QED2

H =

x′

j0(x′)dxdx′
|

(3.3)

where the fermion current jµ(x) is deﬁned as

jµ(x) = ¯ψ(x)γµψ(x).

The massless QED in two dimensions has a mass scale,
that is, the coupling constant g has a mass dimension.
Therefore, all the physical observables such as a boson
mass are measured by the coupling constant g.

The boson ﬁelds ˜Φ(p) and its conjugate ﬁeld ˜Π(p) are
related to the fermion current density in momentum rep-
resentation ˜j0(p) and ˜j1(p) [1]

˜j0(p) = ip

˜Φ(p) =

j0(x)eipxdx

˜j1(p) =

˜Π(p) =

(3.5b)

where ˜Φ(p) and ˜Π(p) satisfy the bosonic commutation
relation

[ ˜Φ(p), ˜Π†(p′)] = iδp,p′.

(3.6)

This commutation relation is proved under the condition
that the fermion operators ˜j0(p) and ˜j1(p) should operate
on the physical states where, in the deep negative states,
all the states are occupied while, in the highly excited
states, there is no particle present.

For the zero mode, ﬁelds ˜Φ(0) and its conjugate ﬁeld
˜Π(0) are related to the regularized chiral charge and its
time derivative, but we do not write them here since they
are not relevant to the present discussion.

C. Complex ﬁeld

The boson ﬁeld ˜Φ(p) is a complex function as one sees
it from eq.(3.5) and can be written in terms of φ(x) in
eq.(2.9)

˜Φ(p) =

φ(x)e−ipx+iωp tdx =

Using Π(x) = ˙φ(x), we ﬁnd

In this case, one sees that the operators cp, c†

[cp, c†

H =

(3.10)

B. Bosonization

Therefore, we can write the Hamiltonian of eq.(3.4) as

The Hamiltonian of the Schwinger model can be

bosonized in the following fashion [4]

H =

1
2 Xp n

˜Π†(p) ˜Π(p) + p2 ˜Φ†(p) ˜Φ(p) +

where the mass of the boson (Schwinger boson
given as

o
(3.4)
) is

which is just the proper expression of the boson Hamil-
tonian. It should be interesting to note that the boson
Hamiltonian of eq.(3.10) has no zero point energy which
is normally an inﬁnite quantity. This must be related to
the fact that the original Hamiltonian which is written
in terms of the fermion operators does not contain any
zero point energy. In fact, in the bosonization procedure,
the vacuum energy as well as the charges of fermions are
regularized in the gauge invariant fashion.

From this example of the physical boson ﬁeld, we see
that the scalar Klein-Gordon ﬁeld must be described by
the complex ﬁeld which corresponds to one ﬂavor boson.
If one wishes to describe two charged bosons, then one
has to introduce the isospin corresponding to a new de-
gree of freedom. It is by now clear that there should not
exist any real scalar ﬁeld as a physical observable.

IV. HIGGS MECHANISM

If the scalar ﬁeld is a complex function, then many
properties of bosons are physically acceptable.
In this
case, however, there is a serious problem in connection
with the Higgs mechanism. The Lagrangian density of
the complex scalar ﬁeld φ(x) which interacts with the
U (1) gauge ﬁeld can be written as

1
2

L

−

=

u0

(Dµφ)†(Dµφ)

φ
|
|
(cid:0)
where u0 and λ are constant. In the Higgs mechanism,
the scalar ﬁeld is rewritten in terms of the two real scalar
ﬁelds η(x) and ξ(x) as

Fµν F µν (4.1)

λ2

−

−

(cid:1)

2

4

φ(x) = (λ + η(x)) ei ξ(x)
λ .

(4.2)

After the spontaneous symmetry breaking, the η(x) ﬁeld
remains physical, and the ξ(x) ﬁeld is absorbed into the
gauge ﬁeld which becomes massive by acquiring one de-
gree of freedom. However, since the real scalar ﬁeld is not
physical, it is quite diﬃcult to carry out the symmetry
breaking mechanism in this fashion. At least, one can-
not understand what the real scalar ﬁeld indicates after
the Higgs mechanism since the Lagrangian density con-
tains the real scalar ﬁeld of η(x) after the spontaneous
symmetry breaking.

In this respect, one should reexamine the Higgs mech-
anism from the point of view of the non-existence of the
real scalar ﬁeld. There is no doubt that the Weinberg-
Salam model has achieved a great success for describ-
ing many experimental observations in connection with

4

the weak decays. Nevertheless, there are still some fun-
damental questions left for the basic mechanism of the
spontaneous symmetry breaking on which the Weinberg-
Salam model is entirely dependent.

V. DISCUSSIONS

The Klein-Gordon equation was discovered 80 years
ago, and since then the boson is believed to be described
by the Klein-Gordon equation. The scalar boson should
exist if it is a composite object. In this case, one sees that
the boson ﬁeld should be complex like the Schr¨odinger
ﬁeld. In most of the ﬁeld theory textbooks, however, it
has been well accepted that the real scalar ﬁeld should
physically exist and that the real scalar ﬁeld is described
as the chargeless particle. At the same time, people real-
ized that the real scalar ﬁeld has some problems like van-
ishing current density. Therefore, it is stated in the text-
books that the real scalar ﬁeld should be always quan-
tized, and then it is all right.

Here, we point out that there should not exist any real
scalar ﬁeld.
Instead, the scalar ﬁeld must be always a
complex function with only one component. In this case,
one can deﬁne the ﬁnite current density and also the
scalar ﬁeld can possess the proper non-relativistic limit
when the motion is slow. In addition, the bosonization
procedure of the Schwinger model shows that the boson
is a complex ﬁeld with one ﬂavor. Since the Schwinger
boson is a physical object, it strongly suggests that the
scalar ﬁeld should be a complex ﬁeld.

However, it is still not yet settled whether the scalar
ﬁeld or the Klein-Gordon equation itself for the elemen-
tary ﬁelds is physically acceptable or not. If the Klein-
Gordon equation is fundamental, then it should have
a proper degree of freedom which should be two while
the Dirac equation has a correct degree of freedoms as a
fermion ﬁeld which is four.

The derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation is closely
connected with the ﬁrst quantization procedure which
should be understood more in depth [1, 5].

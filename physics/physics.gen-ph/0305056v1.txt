Abstract

We derive the gas dynamics equations considering changes of velocity distribu-
tion function on the scale of a molecule free path. We deﬁne the molecule velocity
distribution function in a speciﬁc form so that only molecule velocities after inter-
molecular collisions in a chosen ﬁxed volume are taken into account. The obtained
equations diﬀer from the well-known Navier-Stoks equations and contain the new
terms. The continuity equation includes the second derivatives of dynamical viscos-
ity. The equation of momentum conservation does not include the volume viscosity
and the equation of energy conservation describes the transformation of gas mass
velocity into the gas thermal energy. One can expect that these new equations of
motion allow to construct a description of macroscopic physical phenomena in more
complicated situations than the standard gas dynamics equations do.

1 Introduction

The equations describing gas dynamics are used for studying various fundamental and
applied problems in many areas of macrophysics. In particular, understanding a number of
concrete macroscopic phenomena is based on solutions to Euler or Navier-Stokes equations
determining the behavior of the gas velocity ﬁeld. Standard macroscopic deriving of the
equations of gas dynamics and discussion of their diﬀerent applications are given, for
example, in [1]

In contrast with the fundamental Newton dynamic equations, Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations are approximate and provide a description of a macroscopic gas system in
terms of a reduced number of degrees of freedom. As well known, it is impossible to
ﬁnd an exact solution to a system of Newton equations of motion for all interacting gas
molecules. Therefore, the equations of gas motion are derived by methods of statistical
mechanics, taking into account some approximations allowing to develop the description
of gas in terms of macroscopic variables such as gas densities or mass velocities. One of the
most known approaches leading to equations of gas dynamics in framework of statistical
mechanics is the use of Boltzmann equation. Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are
derived from Boltzmann equation under certain assumptions (viscosity being taken into
account or neglected, respectively). See for details the ref. [2].

In its turn, the formulation of Boltzmann equation is also based on a number of phys-
ical hypotheses, which are discussed in detail, for example, in [2]. In particular, one of
such hypotheses assumes that for a system, which is close to a locally equilibrium state,
the molecules ﬂying into an arbitrary phase volume have the same velocity distribution
function as the molecules inside this phase volume. Within the physical meaning, this
assumption implies that the molecule velocity distribution function does not change es-
sentially on a free-path scale. Therefore, the physical phenomena associated with the
variability of the velocity distribution function on a free-path scale can be neglected. As
a result, deriving of the equations of a gas motion based on the Boltzmann equation takes
into account only those physical phenomena, where the corresponding velocity distribu-
tion function varies on scale larger than a molecular free path in a gas.

The purpose of this paper is the deriving of the equations of gas motion for the physi-
cal situations, where the variations of velocity distribution function on a free-path scale is
essential and can not be neglected. We consider the process of discrete molecule velocity
changes, resulting from intermolecular collisions, as a mechanism responsible for the vari-
ation of the distribution function. The conventional deﬁnition of the velocity distribution
function does not take into account molecule collisions on a free-path scale. Therefore,
it will be the same for both a dense gas of colliding molecules and a highly rareﬁed gas
without collisions. In this paper, we deﬁne a velocity distribution function of molecules
in speciﬁc form in such a way that only the molecule velocities after intermolecular colli-
sions in a chosen ﬁxed volume contribute to this distribution function. The velocities of
molecules, which pass through the volume without collisions, are not taken into account.
The approach developed in this work, unlike the one based on Boltzmann equation, does
not allow the determination of an explicit form of the molecule velocity distribution func-
tion. Nevertheless, this method enables deriving the equations of gas motion under the
only assumption that the molecule velocity distribution function is spherically symmetric.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to discussing the standard

after intermolecular collisions is considered. Section 4 is devoted to the deriving the mass,
momentum and energy ﬂuxes for homogeneous gas on the base of new deﬁnition of the
velocity distribution function. In Section 5 we discuss a general method to obtain the
conservation equations for mass, momentum and energy in inhomogeneous gas. Section
6 is devoted to deriving the concrete form of mass conservation equation. In Section 7 we
derive the momentum conservation equation. Section 8 is devoted to deriving the energy
conservation equation. In Summary we brieﬂy formulate the basic results of the paper.

2 Classical principles of deriving the equations of gas

dynamics

Deriving the equations of gas motion by statistical mechanics methods is built upon
several basic principles.

a. The gas ﬁlls some domain of space.
b. The gas is in a inhomogeneous state, i.e., density, pressure, and mass velocity of

gas at diﬀerent points in space are diﬀerent.

c. It is possible to single out a small enough, but macroscopic domain of space, which
contains a macroscopically large number of molecules. The changes in density, pressure,
and mass velocity of the gas within the domain are small compared to their changes in
the overall enclosing space.

d. Molecular distribution inside the domain is absolutely homogeneous. Molecules
cross the boundaries of the domain on both sides thus changing the density, pressure, and
mass velocity of the gas . The molecules ﬂying into the domain increase gas density and
pressure inside it, while the molecules ﬂying out of the domain decrease them. The mass
velocity of the gas in the chosen domain also changes.

e. The rate of change of the parameters depends on the number of molecules, which ﬂy
into or out of the domain, and also on the velocity of these molecules. It can be calculated
from the the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy.

f. Mass, momentum and energy of the gas molecules are additive physical quantities,
i.e., if one set of molecules is, on the whole, characterized by value C1 for mass, momentum
or energy and the other by C2 , then both sets of these molecules are characterized by
value Cs = C1 + C2. Such physical quantities satisfy the local conservation laws for mass,
momentum and energy , which are expressed as follows:

Here C is the density of the physical value under consideration (e.g., density of mass or
density of energy), ~Jc is the density of the corresponding ﬂux. If the physical value is a
vector (e.g., momentum), the following equations must be fulﬁlled for the each of its i-th
component.

Thus, the density of a ﬂux for a scalar quantity (mass, energy) will be a vector, and the
one for a vector quantity (momentum) will be a second-rank tensor.

Equations

(1) and (2) are valid for an arbitrary domain and if no sources of mass,
energy or momentum are inside the domain, these equations allow us to construct a
description of physical eﬀects on the base of those assumptions, which are incorporated
in the conservation law equations for density of mass, momentum and energy ﬂuxes.

In their turn, the density of mass, momentum and energy ﬂuxes in a gas can be
calculated from the velocity distribution function f (~V , ~r, t). The equations for the density
of mass, momentum and energy ﬂuxes have the following form:

the i-th component of the density of ﬂux J i

Hence, if the molecular velocity distribution function is given, the calculation of the
physical quantities is reduced to formal procedures. However, it seems that it is impossible
to ﬁnd the function f (~V , ~r, t) only from experimental data. Therefore to deﬁne this
function, we have to use a theoretical approach. The generally accepted deﬁnition of the
distribution function is formulated as follows.

DEFINITION 1 (SNAPSHOT)
The function f (~V , ~r, t) is given by a velocity histogram of the molecules in volume dV.
Hereafter, the method, which is generally used to ﬁnd this function will be referred to as
”instant snapshot”. The virtual camera located inside volume dV centered around point
~r records at time t all the molecules inside this volume. It is assumed that this camera
also measures and records the velocities of all the molecules inside this volume at a given
time t. Then one counts the number of molecules with a certain velocity vector (velocity
modulus and direction) and then calculates the velocity histogram of the molecules.

After that the following formal transformations are fulﬁlled. The mass velocity ~u for

all molecules in the domain under consideration is determined in the form

~u =

f (~V , ~r, t)~V d~V

Z

A diﬀerence between the total velocity of a molecule ~V and the mass velocity ~u is called
proper velocity of a molecule in the moving with gas reference frame and denoted ~v. The
proper velocity is called usually a thermal velocity. For proper velocity, the velocity distri-
bution function ˜f (~v, ~r, t) is also introduced, it is evident that this function is functionally
connected to distribution function velocities f (~V , ~r, t) on total velocities.

Now, for a ﬁnal derivation of the macroscopic equations of motion we have to deﬁne a
form of distribution functions of molecules for the proper velocities. For this purpose the
following assumption is usually introduced: the gas in considered domain has a locally
equilibrium state.
In this case the proper velocity distribution function is well-known
Maxwell distribution function. After that, a formal consideration based on eqs. (1), (2)
and (4) leads to the of Euler equation ( see the details in [2]).

3

To derive the Navier-Stokes equation, we have to represent the distribution function
as the sum of the locally equilibrium function and some small unknown function (small
perturbation). Then, taking into account the certain assumption about the small pertur-
bation we can ﬁnd the corrections to the Euler equation describing the eﬀects associated
with viscosity and thermal conductivity (Navier-Stokes equation; see the details in [2]).

3 Deﬁnition of proper velocity distribution function

taking into account the molecular collisions

The DEFINITION 1 does not take into account the collisions of molecules and will be
the same both for gas without collisions, and for gas with collisions. If our aim is to study
the physical values in a gas for the situations where molecular collisions are essential, we
have to ﬁnd a distribution function containing the eﬀects of molecular collisions in its
expression from the very beginning. Therefore, we change the above DEFINITION 1
as follows.

Let’s consider a domain ﬁlled with gas of colliding molecules and let the free path λ
be much smaller then the characteristic scale of the domain and much smaller then the
characteristic scale of the problems under consideration. These assumptions are fulﬁlled
for the most practically important problems. For example, free path of molecules in air at
atmospheric pressure and room temperature is about 10−7 cm whereas the characteristic
scale of any macroscopic problem is much larger.

To ﬁnd the distribution function taking into account the molecular collisions we accept

the following deﬁnition.

DEFINITION 2 (CINEMA FILM)
As before, we single out a domain dV which size is small comparing to the free path of
molecules in a gas. When we have considered the velocity histogram in DEFINITION
1, the velocities of molecules have been shot by the camera. Now we use a movie camera.
It shoots on a ﬁlm a series of consecutive pictures of molecules in the domain dV during
the time interval dt, duration of which will be deﬁned later.

Let us divide the molecules, whose images are shot on the picture area of a ﬁlm into
two groups. The ﬁrst group contains the molecules, which have taken part in the colli-
sions inside the considered domain. Now we assume that the velocities for distribution
function are taken into account only for molecules right after the collision. As a graphic
illustration for such a situation we propose that colliding molecules in the volume dV un-
der consideration are visible and can be seen by the observer, while the molecules ﬂying
without collisions are invisible. The observer sees only painted molecules and, therefore,
only their velocities deﬁne the distribution function for him. Second group of molecules,
which pass through the above volume dV without collisions, does not contribute to dis-
tribution function. We will deﬁne the normalized molecular velocity distribution function
fs(~V , ~r, t) on the base of set of velocities obtained in such a way. Namely this function
will be further considered as the molecular velocity distribution function fs(~V , ~r, t) at the
given point of space, at the given time t.

In order to deﬁne this function statistically, in the same way as the function f (~V , ~r, t)
according to the DEFINITION 1 it is necessary to take into account that a number of
molecules, which is used to evaluate of the molecule velocity distribution function, would
be equal to a total number of molecules in volume dV at the time t. The number of

4

collisions is proportional to time. If the time interval dt is approximately λ/¯v, where ¯v
is a average modulus of proper velocity, a number of colliding molecules will be equal
to a number of molecules in chosen volume dV . For gas under normal conditions this
time is about 10−11s and is much less then characteristic time of change of macroscopic
parameters of gas. Since the distribution function is macroscopic characteristic of gas,
the times t and t+dt are not distinguished one from another. Therefore, we can treat
the function determined according to the above rules as molecule velocity distribution
function at the time t. We will call this statement the DEFINITION 2.

One has to note that the above deﬁnition does not allow to obtain an explicit form of
the distribution function in the same sense as in the DEFINITION 1. Nevertheless, it
is possible a priori to draw a conclusion about the important features of such a function.
Let us introduce the deﬁnition of the mass velocity ~u and proper velocity ~v = ~V − ~u
as above. According to the DEFINITION 2, the proper velocity of a molecule is
the velocity of a molecule after collision in a reference frame moving with gas. The
vectors of proper velocities of molecules after collisions have equiprobable directions in this
reference frame. Therefore, the proper velocity distribution function ˜fs(~v, ~r, t) will exhibit
a spherical symmetry. This property of spherical symmetry means that all directions of
proper velocity vector of molecules ~v are equivalent.

The property of spherical symmetry is very important to ﬁnd the explicit expression for
macroscopic quantities according to the equation (3). Taking into account the spherical
symmetry one deﬁne the dimensional distribution function function depending only on
modulus of proper velocity |~v|, ˜fs = ˜fs(|~v|). Then, the ﬂuxes of mass, momentum and
energy can be easily calculated.

To simplify the expressions we will write the distribution function of the modules of

proper velocity as fs(v). The normalization condition for this function fs(v) looks like

˜fs(|~v|)d|~v| =

fs(v)dv = 1

Namely the function ˜fs will be used further to derive the macroscopic equations of motion.

4 Equations for ﬂux of mass and momentum in ho-

mogeneous rest gas.

Volume ﬁlled with gas can be treated as continuous up to spatial scale of free path of
molecules. It means, that only the collisions cause a change of velocity vector of a molecule.
After collision, the velocity of the molecule does not vary, until it collides with another
molecule. Between the collisions, the molecule passes an average distance approximately
equal to free pass λ. The molecule, which had a collision, keeps a constant velocity during
the free path (of course, if there is no external ﬁeld).

Hence, the gas of colliding molecules can be considered as the set of points, each of
them is spherical ”source” of molecules with velocity distribution function belonging to
the given concrete point. Intensity of a molecular ﬂux from each such a point decreases
proportionally to an inverse square distance from the given point. Let us consider a
sphere of the radius λ surrounding the radiating point.
It is clear that beyond this
sphere, the intensity of a ”source” becomes equal to zero, since there should be a next
collisions of molecules here. After the collisions, the velocities of molecules belong to other

5

distributions, which appropriate to other ”radiating” points located on a surface of the
same sphere.

The intensity of a considered point ”source” is a product of velocity of molecules and
their density. The above deﬁnition of velocity distribution function does not allow to
ﬁnd a density of colliding molecules in the volume under consideration. This density (we
denote it ρ′) can be obtained using the following arguments. Let us introduce a surface
into a gas and an observer behind this surface. This observer counts a number of molecules
ﬂying through the surface with diﬀerent velocities. It is found that N molecules have a
ﬂux under the certain angle θ, ϕ with the certain velocity V. It is not possible to say,
from which of radiating points one or other molecule has started its ﬂight. The observer
is able to determine only a sum of intensities from all sources and this sum is equal to a
product of the true density of the gas ρ near the surface and the velocity of molecules.
On the other hand, this sum is equal to the integral of the intensity of all radiating points
at distances from 0 up to λ from a point of observation. Therefore, one can write

ρV (θ, ϕ) =

ρ′V (θ, ϕ)dl

Hence

λ
Let’s place in homogeneous non-moving gas of colliding molecules a surface dS located
at a point with the coordinates x, y, z, and small comparing to λ2. Normal vector to
this surface is directed along the axis X. Only the molecules, which had collisions inside
the sphere of radius λ, cross such a surface. The molecules which had the collisions in
hemisphere located to the left from dS ﬂy along the positive direction of X axis and the
molecules which had the collisions in hemisphere located to the right from dS ﬂy along
the negative direction of X axes. The total ﬂux through dS will be equal to the diﬀerence
of two above ﬂuxes.

(8)

The ﬂux is considered at some time t. At this time point, only the molecules which
had the collisions near the surface dS and the molecules which had the collisions on the
distance l from the surface dS ﬂy through the given surface. Therefore, the distribution
functions belong to the diﬀerent time points. However, maximal diﬀerence in time is equal
to λ/V , that for gas at normal conditions is around 10−11 s. Hence, one can neglect a
diﬀerence in time between collisions and to consider, that all molecules had collisions at
the same t (simultaneously).

Let’s calculate a ﬂux along positive directions of the axis . We set a polar coordinate
system in the hemisphere, where a distance from dS to a point inside a hemisphere is
equal to r, and the angle between normal to dS and direction of r is equal to θ. Let’s
divide the hemisphere into layers parallel to dS and located at the various distances l
from dS. A thickness of a layer is dl. A distance from dS to a point at layer at the
distance l is equal to r = l /cosθ. We associate a small volume dV with each point of
hemisphere attached to dS and consider this volume dV as a source of molecules with
distribution on modules of proper velocity fs(v). The intensity of source for molecules
with proper velocity from v to v+dv is equal to ρfs(v)vdvdV /λ. Density of a ﬂux of
molecules dI decreases proportionally to inverse square of distance r2 = l2/cos2θ. The
ﬂux dJ→ through dS is equal to the product density dI and a projection dS, which is

6

equal to dS cos θ. Thus, ﬂux dJ→ from a single radiating point can be written as follows

dJ→ =

ρ fs(v)vdvdV dS cos3 θ
4π l2λ

Let’s divide a hemisphere of radius λ into layers of thickness dl, located at the distance l
from a surface dS. Each layer, in its turn, is divided into the rings with constant angle θ,
where radius of the ring R = l tanθ. Volume of the ring is RdRdl. Also, dR = l dθ/cos2θ.
The ﬂux dJc→ through a surface dS from such a ring is equal to

dJc→ =

ρfs(v)vdv cos θdS tan θdθdl
2λ

For all rings belonging to a layer at the distance l, the angle θ varies from 0 to arccos(l/λ).
Therefore, the ﬂux from the whole layer dJl→ is equal to integral from dJc→ over θ from
0 to arccos(l/λ). As a result we get

dJl→ =

0

arccos(l/λ)

dJc→ dθ =

The ﬂux through dS is equal to the sum of ﬂuxes from all layers, which are located away
from dS at the distance from 0 to λ.

If we divide the expression obtained for any surface dS by dS we will have the expression
for a mass ﬂux density along axis for the molecules, whose velocity is equal to v. The
integration over v gives mass ﬂux density along a positive direction of X-axis as a result
of the proper velocity

Together with the ﬂux of mass along a positive direction of an X-axis there exists a ﬂux of
mass coming along a negative direction of axes and having the same value. The resulting
ﬂux of mass is equal to a diﬀerence between two above ﬂuxes, i. e. the total ﬂux is equal
to zero.

X-component of the momentum of the each individual molecule is equal to mvcos θ.
Multiplying (9) with vcos θ we obtain an equation for density of a ﬂux for X-component
of momentum from each radiating point. The similar calculations lead to the following
result for the density of the ﬂux X-component of the momentum along a positive direction
of X-axis

Apart, a ﬂux coming along a negative direction of an X-axis also exists. It has the same
absolute value but opposite direction. The resulting density of a ﬂux of X-component of
the momentum is equal to a diﬀerence of above two ﬂuxes. However the momentum,
in contrast with a mass, is a vector quantity. Therefore, a diﬀerence of the ﬂuxes of
momentum along positive and along negative directions of X-axis is equal to the doubled
value of

(14). As a result, we obtain the known formula for hydrostatic pressure

The energy is scalar quantity, therefore the resulting density of a ﬂux is equal to zero, like
for density of a ﬂux of mass.

5 General approach of deriving the equations of mo-

tion for inhomogeneous gas.

Let’s consider, as in the previous section, a domain ﬁlled with gas, where a free path is
much smaller than the size of the domain and much smaller than the characteristic scale
of a problem. The gas is in a inhomogeneous state, i. ., a density and velocity distribution
function at diﬀerent points of the volume diﬀer from each other.

Let’s place any surface in gas. This surface will be crossed by molecules which come
from the both sides of the surface. Since the molecules do not change the velocity on
the scale λ, the eﬀective sources of ﬂuxes of molecules is located from each other at the
distance determined by free path λ. It means, the ﬂuxes of molecules on the diﬀerent sides
of the surface will have the diﬀerent parameters: density, temperature, mass velocity and
the velocity distribution function. The diﬀerence of physical parameters of molecular
ﬂuxes leads to appearance of terms with spatial derivatives in expressions for ﬂuxes for
mass, momentum and energy.

The derivation of the equations is carried out under the following restrictions:
1. The linear approximation is considered. Accordingly to this, only the ﬁrst spatial

derivatives of density, mass and proper velocities are taken into account.

2. The approximation of small velocities is considered.

It means, a module of the

mass velocity |~u| is much smaller than average module of proper velocity ¯|v|.

6 The mass conservation equation.

To derive the mass conservation equation, taking into account the collisions of molecules,
it is necessary to ﬁnd an expression for mass ﬂux, suitable for these conditions. Let’s
associate with a point x, y, z a small surface dS, directed perpendicularly to X-axis in
non-moving laboratory reference frame.

At the given point x, y, z gas is characterized by the density ρ, mass velocity ~u and

distribution function on modules of proper velocity fs(v).

The calculations for inhomogeneous gas are basically similar to the calculations for
homogeneous gas. The sphere attached to dS is divided into layers and etc. Equation
(6)is written as follows

where ux is X-th component of the mass velocity. The ﬂux from a ring is written in
appropriate way

dJ→ =

ρ fs(v)(v cos θ + ux)dvdS cos2 θ
4π l2

dJc→ =

ρfs(v)dv(v cos θ + ux)dS tan θdθ
2

(17)

(18)

For all rings belonging to the layer at the distance l, angle θ varies from 0 to arccos(l/λ).
Therefore, the total ﬂux from all layer dJl→ is equal to integral from dJc→ over θ from 0
to arccos(l/λ).

The ﬂux through dS is equal to the sum of the ﬂuxes from all layers, which are located
away from dS at the distances from 0 to λ. Since the infomogeneous gas is considered, the
density ρ, proper velocity v and X-th component of the mass velocity ux are the function
of the distance from dS to the layer at the distance l. In ﬁrst approximation we restrict
ourselves to the linear terms in spatial derivatives in expansion of all quantities.

Partial derivative on y and z do not contribute to the expressions for ﬂux on axis , since
they are averaged under integration over ring.

The signs at partial derivatives in eqs. (17), (18) and (19) are deﬁned by a direction
of a ﬂux. It means, the sign for a ﬂux on left side from dS will be opposite to sign on
right.

The ﬂux of mass through dS is equal to the diﬀerence of ﬂuxes on the left and on the
right sides. Since the case |~u | << ¯|v| is considered, the terms containing the powers of λ
higher than ﬁrst and the products of the quantities uxλ, which are small comparing to vλ,
are omitted. Expression for X-th component of a resulting vector of a mass ﬂux resulted
from the molecules with velocity v can be written in the following form

For obtaining the ﬁnal result, it is necessity to integrate eq.(20) over velocity.
It is
reasonable to assume, that the form of distribution function fs(v) does not change on
scale λ, i. e.
relative changes of individual velocities are proportional to changes of
average velocity. Then we can write the relation

The expression (28) diﬀers from the known continuity equation in the derivatives of vis-
cosity. Factor 1/2 at the corresponding term is explained by hemispheres attached to each
other which are the integral sources of molecules.

7 The momentum conservation equation

The momentum conservation equation is derived in the similar way to mass conservation
equation with the help of substituting the appropriate quantities for momentum compo-
nents by the untegrand of eq.(2). Density of a ﬂux of X-th component of momentum
along the X-axis djpx→ from the individual radiating point is equal to

The ﬂux from the right hemisphere dJlpx← will be calculated by the same manner. The
resulting ﬂux through dS is equal to the sum of these ﬂuxes and for ﬁxed velocity v can
be written as follows

Appearance of the hydrodynamical pressure in the expression for pressure Π is explained
by the following way. The pressure is deﬁned as a ﬂux of a momentum of molecules
colliding with some surface. Quantitatively, this ﬂux of momentum is equal to a product
of momentum mV of individual molecule with ﬂux of number of molecules nV colliding
with the surface. Then, we get for hydrostatic pressure P ∼< mV nV >= ρ < V 2 >.
The mass velocity leads to the change of both values of the momentum and the number
of molecules, colliding with the surface. However, this eﬀect works only at the distance of
free path. Therefore, the correction to the hydrostatic pressure is equal to a product mV
with nV λ ∂ui
. Thus, expression (37) deﬁnes the actual measurable

First three terms in the equation (46) are similar to the known energy conservation equa-
tion taking into account the process of heat transfer. Two last terms in the equation (46)
describe a process of energy dissipation of the ordering motion into the thermal energy
of gas due to the work of forces of viscosity. Energy dissipation can be understood as
follows. There are the collisions of molecules at each space point. The molecules ﬂying
to the given point have the diﬀerent velocity distribution, in particular they have the
diﬀerent mass velocities. After the collision, the molecules belong to the same velocity
distribution. As a result, a part of energy of the ordering motion approximately equal
to µ
will be always used for heating of gas. Hence, all processes in a gas, resulted
from the change of the mass velocity, are irreversible processes. Thus, the equation (46)
leads to the possibility to describe correctly the energy dissipation at the gas motion.

9 Summary

We have introduced the new deﬁnition of the molecule velocity distribution function
describing the molecular motion on a free-path scale. Using this deﬁnition we derived
the equations of gas dynamics containing the new terms in comparison with well known
equations ref. [2]. The equation of mass conservation (31) includes the new contribution
with second derivative of dynamic viscosity. The equations of momentum conservation
(39 - 41) do not contain the volume viscosity. The equations of energy conservation (46
-47) describe the transformation of energy of gas mass velocity into the thermal energy
of gas.

The new equations of gas dynamics derived here are approximate like the Euler and
Navier-Stokes equations. We have restricted ourselves by the approximation of small
velocities. Nevertheless, we hope that these new equations will be useful for description
of the nonequilibrium phenomena in various areas of macroscopic physics. For example,
these equations can be applicable to computation of atmospheric processes like turbulence
and solution of the aerodynamic problems like modeling a subsonic ﬂuxes. We plan to
discuss such problems on the base of our new equations in forthcoming works.

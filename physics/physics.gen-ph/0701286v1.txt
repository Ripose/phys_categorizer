Thermodynamics of a Dust Universe
Energy density, Temperature, Pressure and
Entropy for Cosmic Microwave Background

James G. Gilson j.g.gilson@qmul.ac.uk∗

January 24, 2007

Abstract

This paper continues the building of the cosmological theory that was
introduced in two earlier papers under the title A Dust Universe Solution
to the Dark Energy Problem. The model introduced in this theory has
existence before time zero so that it is not necessary to interpret it as
of big-bang origin. The location of the Cosmic Microwave Background,
within the theoretical structure gives a closing of the fundamentals of
the model in terms of the deﬁnitions of Temperature, Entropy and other
Thermodynamic aspects. Thus opening up a research tool in cosmology
in exact agreement with experiment that can compete with the so-called
Standard Big Bang Model as a mathematical-physical description of our
universe based rigorously on Einstein’s general relativity. It is suggested
that the singularity at time zero involves a population inversion in the
statistical mechanics sense and so justiﬁes the use of negative temperature
for the CMB at negative times. This also has the satisfactory consequence
that the Universe’s evolution involves entropy steadily increasing over all
time from minus inﬁnity through the singularity to plus inﬁnity.

1 Introduction

The work to be described in this paper is an extension and general discussion
of the signiﬁcance and physical interpretations of the papers A Dust Universe
Solution to the Dark Energy Problem [23] and Existence of Negative Gravity Ma-
terial. Identiﬁcation of Dark Energy [24]. The conclusions arrived at in those
papers was that the dark energy substance is physical material with a positive
density, as is usual, but with a negative gravity, -G, characteristic and which is
twice as abundant as has usually been considered to be the case. References to
equations in those papers will be prefaced with the letter A and B respectively.
The work in A, B, the discussion here and the extensions here have origins in
the studies of Einstein’s general relativity in the Friedman equations context
to be found in references ([16],[22],[21],[20],[19],[18],[4],[23]) and similarly mo-
tivated work in references ([10],[9],[8],[7],[5]) and ([12],[13],[14],[15],[7]). Other

useful sources of information have been references ([17],[3]) with the measure-
ment essentials coming from references ([1],[2],[11]). Further references will be
mentioned as necessary. After writing A and B, I found that Abbe Georges
Lemaˆıtre [25] had produced much the same model in 1927 but had presented it
with a greatly diﬀerent emphasis and interpretation while also missing impor-
tant aspects of the signiﬁcance of the model that have emerged from the version
and structure that I had found. He seems to have been only aware of the pos-
itive time solution and then only in a restricted form in his 1927 paper. See
remarks on page 66 of McVitties’s book [28]. Abbe Georges Lemaˆıtre is often
referred to as the father of the big-bang but it seems to me that this reputation
arose out of his omission of the negative time solution in his considerations of
this early model. The explicit solution for r(t), equation (3.8) here, is also not
mentioned in the 1927 paper. Up to date, there are generally few references to
the explicit solution, (3.8), and sparse developments of its form. In particular,
I have found a substantial application of this formula by the authors Ronald
J. Adler et al [26] in a paper called Finite Cosmology and a CMB Cold Spot.
Their work has common ground with the present paper. However, they fail to
realise the power of the scale factor (3.8) and use it in conjunction with a time
patching scheme making use of the related looking formula (1.1),

a(t) ∼ sinh1/2(t/(2Rd))

(1.1)

where Rd is the de Sitter radius, to represent the radiation dominated era just
as the formula (2.2) is used in the standard model to represent this era. This
patching will be discussed in detail in the next section. I have not found who ﬁrst
wrote down the formula (3.8). The scale factor (3.8) and its universe although
known about for many years, seems to have been almost totally eclipsed and
overshadowed by the vast eﬀort put into developing over the last eighty years
of what is now called The Standard Model .

2 Defect in Standard model

The standard cosmological model is generally accepted as giving a good and
plausible description of the evolution of the universe from the initially assumed
big bang through to the present time and into predicting the future of the
universe. At the same time, it can be used to give a convincing case for how
the material structures of which the universe is composed now has evolved from
simpler and more fundamental materials that were likely predominant at earlier
times. This is seen as a building and complexifying process with time which is
assumed to be driven by temperature change from the very high temperature in
the vicinity of the big bang the low temperate of the present day. The physical
processes that are involved can be identiﬁed from general earthbound physical
theory and technology that associates the need for speciﬁc ranges of temperature
with the possibility of known processes occurring. Thus the dependence of the
temperature T (t) on time, t, is the main key to the structural evolution of the
universe.

At this moment in time, we have only one convincing theory of gravity,
Einstein’s General Relativity and its consequence the Friedman equations, as a
description for the process of cosmological evolution with epoch. It is generally
assumed that the standard cosmological model is rigorously a solution to the
Einstein ﬁeld equations. I do not wish to be dogmatic but I believe the truth
of this assumption is questionable. To examine this issue let us consider the
mathematical structures that constitutes the standard model. Nowadays, the
standard model is said to describe four main phases in the birth and evolution

2 DEFECT IN STANDARD MODEL

of the universe. They are (1) inﬂation and the big bang, (2) a radiation domi-
nated phase, (3) a matter dominated phase and (4) accelerated expansion into
the distant future. Essentially three distinct rigorous solutions to Einstein’s
ﬁeld equations as represented by their distinct scale factors, rA(t), rB(t), rC (t)
and distinct temperature time relations TA(t), TB(t), TC (t) can be found to ac-
commodate the type of physical process assumed to be taking place within each
epoch interval A,B and C . The three scale factors or radii involved are usually
represented as,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

rA(t) ∼ exp(Ht).

rB(t) ∼ t1/2.

rC (t) ∼ t2/3.

This ﬁrst A stage involves Guth’s inﬂation determined by a very large value for
Einstein’s cosmological constant, ΛA and the big-bang event.

This second stage B is the radiation dominated epoch, with some appropriate
value for Einstein’s cosmological constant, ΛB.

This third stage C which includes the present time, t0 = t†, is the mass dom-
inated epoch with accelerating expansion into the future determined by the
deﬁnite measured value of Einstein’s cosmological constant, ΛC = Λ. I have
emphasised that the three solutions A,B,C above are rigorously each a solution
of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. Further, full versions can be found with detailed
coeﬃcients so that the ∼ sign can be replaced with the = sign. However, these
solution are called the Standard Model when they are patched together in time
sequence. Mathematically, this patching process can be carried through for
both the scale factors and the time temperature relations to ﬁnd a single form
covering the time range 0 → +∞. It seems to me that this ﬁnal form is not
strictly speaking a rigorous solution to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations and for the
following reasons. Einstein’s ﬁeld equations are causal in the sense that paths
calculated from theory are determined for all time by initial conditions and this
applies to the points on the boundary of the expanding universe given by the
radial variable r(t). Thus for rigorous solutions r(t) cannot change its form in
time passage without some external intervention outside the guiding inﬂuence
of general relativity. There is no statistical aspect of relativity in its accepted
unmodiﬁed form that allow for choice between random selection of options at
any stage of an evolution process. Statistics is involved in the thermal aspects
of modern cosmology but this process the CMB is eﬀectively locked away in a
background subspace and can only inﬂuence paths through a constant thermal
mass contribution in spite of its density changing with temperature and epoch.
If such a change of motion had occurred in actual history, it could be regarded
as due to the actual randomness of natural events or as an act of God but this
later explanation is certainly outside relativity. Such a change would be on
a par with the big-bang concept itself which is generally admitted not to be
understood or likely to be explainable by present theory. From the theoretical
point of view of the standard model, such changes have been allowed by mod-
ern cosmologists in order to conform to human intuitions and preconceptions
of how things should be. They may, of course, be right with their intuitive
pictures of event sequences but still this is not science and not necessarily proof
that the time patched solutions are rigorous solutions to the ﬁeld equations.
This argument against the standard model is strongly reinforced by the fact
that solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equation involving the cosmological constant
requires that this quantity really remains constant over all the time for which

the theory or solution is being used. We have seen that the standard model
involves at least two deﬁnite changes to its parameter values for r(t) and T (t)
and Λ. There is another important aspect of this issue and that is that the
model I am proposing is rigorously a solution in isolation.
It does not need
patching up or joining to other solution to give a full time solution. Further it
can supply all the facilities and options that are oﬀered by the standard model
for material synthesis resulting from temperature and pressure conditions that
change with epoch and more. Showing that this is the case is what this paper
is all about.

3 Summary of Mathematical Structure of Model

The main theoretical basis for the work to be discussed here are the two Fried-
man equations that derive from general relativity with the curvature parameter
k = 0 and a positively valued Λ. For ease of reference these equations and the
main results obtained so far from the dark energy model are listed next,

where M †
Λ is the total dark energy mass within the universe and MU is the total
non-dark energy mass within the universe. Equation (3.23) or equation (3.24)
is exactly the classical Newtonian result for the acceleration at the boundary of
a spherical distribution positive G mass density. The function r(t) (3.8) is the
radius or scale factor1 for this model([3]). After writing A and B, I found the
connection with Lemaˆıtre’s work.

An interesting and signiﬁcant result that follows easily from this theory is
the identiﬁcation of the Newtonian gravitational Coulomb like potential that
is equivalent to Einstein’s general relativity with his positive cosmological con-
stant Λ > 0 or expressed otherwise, the Newtonian Coulomb potential limit
of relativity with Einstein’s dark energy. All that is needed is to replace the
Newtonian equivalent density for a point source potential at epoch-time, t, with
the general relativity gravity weighted density, ρG(t), equation (3.20),

This procedure gives the result,

in place of the Newtonian result

ρG(t) = ρ(t) − ρ†
Λ.

¨r = −M G/r2 + rΛc2/3

¨r = −M G/r2.

The inverse square is simply modiﬁed with the addition of a term linear in r
and proportional to Einstein’s Λ.

4 Thermodynamics of the CMB

The thermodynamics of dust with its characteristically zero pressure as de-
scribed here by the quantity P (t) equation (3.12) may seem to present this the-
ory with some conceptual diﬃculties, if it is to include the cosmical microwave
background as part of its structure. However, this turns out not to be the case
as will be explained. The model is geometrically and dynamically completely
deﬁned, it does have pressure as part of its structure but the thermodynamical
signiﬁcance of this pressure which is identically zero over the whole life span of
this model and any relation it may have with a temperature is not obvious. The
zero dust pressure does decompose into positive and negative signed components
and as usual the dark energy material contributes the negative pressure. The
dark energy component is identiﬁed ﬁrmly with truly negatively characterised
gravitating material but takes the form of a positive mass density, ρ†
Λ which is
twice the dark energy density, ρΛ, identiﬁed by Einstein. There is no reason to

1After writing A, I found mention of this scale factor in Michael Berry’s Book, p. 129

4 THERMODYNAMICS OF THE CMB

6

believe that the CMB should be directly associated with the dark energy vac-
uum constituent and also be negative G characterised and so to add the CMB
into the structure the obvious choice is to make it part of the conserved mass
of the universe which has been denoted earlier by MU , equation (3.28). This
placement for the CMB is reinforced by the fact that blackbody radiation is
not an absolute constant as is the dark energy density but rather depends on
temperature which itself is usually assumed to vary with epoch time. I therefore
make the strong assumption,

MU = M∆ + MΓ,

(4.1)

where MU , the total conserved non-dark energy mass of the universe, M∆ is
the conserved mass that is neither CMB nor non-dark energy mass and MΓ,
is the conserved CMB mass of the universe and all are taken to be absolute
constants. In this paper, I shall restrict the discussion to the assumption (4.1).
I refer to this assumption as strong as there are other option possibilities all of
which can keep MU costant over all time because the model depends essentially
on the assumption that Rindler’s constant C = 2MU G is an absolute constant
and this is what makes the integration of the Friedman equations yield the
model. Clearly, C can be kept constant if MU varies with time with whatever
side eﬀects that may have. The main consequence of the assumption (4.1) is
that total non-dark energy density, MU and both ∆ and Γ component densities
acquire an epoch time dependence as a result of the equations,

MU = ρ(t)VU (t),
M∆ = ρ∆(t)VU (t),
MΓ = ρΓ(t)VU (t),
(4.4)
where the volume of the universe at time t is given by VU (t) = 4πr3(t)/3. Taking
the cosmic microwave background radiation to conform to the usual blackbody
radiation description, the mass density function for the CMB will have the form

(4.2)
(4.3)

ρΓ(t) = aT 4(t)/c2,

a = π2k4/(15~3c3),

= 4σ/c,

where σ is the Stephan-Boltzmann constant,

σ = π2k4/(60~3c2),

= 5.670400 × 10−8 W m−2 K −4.

The total mass associated with the CMB is given by (4.4). That is

MΓ = ρΓ(t)VU (t),

= (aT 4(t)/c2)4πr3(t)/3
= (aT 4(t)/(3c2))4πb3 sinh2(θ±(t))
= (aT 4(t)/(3c2))4π(RΛ/c)22MU G sinh2(θ±(t))
= (8πaT 4(t)/(3c4))(RΛ)2MU G sinh2(θ±(t))

It follows from (4.14) that the temperature, T(t) as a function of epoch can be
expressed as,

(8πaT 4(t)/(3c4)) = MΓ/((RΛ)2MU G sinh2(θ±(t)))

(4.15)

T 4(t) = MΓ(3c4)/(8πa(RΛ)2MU G sinh2(θ±(t)))
(4.16)
T (t) = ±(MΓ3c4/(8πa(RΛ)2MU G sinh2(θ±(t))))1/4 (4.17)
T (t) = ±((MΓ3c2/(4πa))(r(t)3))1/4.

The fourth power equation in T has four solutions two of which are real and
two of which are complex and so the latter two can be neglected. The positive
solution is obviously important but the negative solution also turns out to play
an important role in this theory. I shall return to this issue.

The well established fact that at the present time, t†, the temperature of the

T (t†) = T † = 2.728 K

(4.19)

can be used to simplify the formula (4.18) because with (4.19) it implies that

where it is understood that the fourth root is taken after the square root. The
formula relating temperature and time (4.22) is diﬀerent from those which are
used in the standard model. The formula here arises in this model in a very
natural way. The other thermodynamics quantities for the CMB , free energy
F(T,V) as a function of temperature and volume, entropy SΓ, pressure PΓ and
energy EΓ also arise naturally in their usual forms and as functions of time,

cesses. They can be found in this theory with the single temperature all-time
formula, T (t), given by equation (4.22).

Approximate list of physical processes associated
with temperature ranges implied by T (t):

Preliminary remark: Processes are associated with times in this list using
times often quoted in the standard model [29]. The association of process with
temperature in the standard model is of very low-level accuracy so I have made
no attempt to get accurate connection of time with process. The list is just to
show qualitatively that the processes described in the standard model can also
be described in the model that I am proposing with at least equal detail.

The zero and positive valued times listed above from the standard model,
tA → tH , interspersed with theoretical values (0, t1, tc, t†, t2) from the present
theory, in numerical time order, are given in the following list. The present
theory contains time symmetrical event t → −t that are not listed.

According to the strong assumption (4.1) MU , the total conserved mass of the
universe, M∆ the conserved ∆ mass of the universe and MΓ, the conserved CMB
mass of the universe are all absolute constants. Thus the ratio of CMB mass to
the ∆ mass, rΓ,∆ = MΓ/M∆, will be an absolute constant with epoch change
together with the same ratio in terms of the corresponding time dependent
densities, ρΓ(t) and ρ∆(t). The value of this ratio is,

rΓ,∆ = ρΓ(t)/ρ∆(t) ≈ 0.00019151 ≈ 2 × 10−4

ΩM (t) = Ω∆(t) + ΩΓ(t)

rΓ,∆ = ΩΓ(t)/Ω∆(t) ≈ 2 × 10−4

(5.5)
(5.6)

(5.7)
(5.8)

ΩM (t) ≈ Ω∆(t)(1 + 2 × 10−4)
Ω∆(t) ≈ ΩM (t)(1 − 2 × 10−4)
(5.9)
Ω∆(t) ≈ ΩM (t)−0.00005, ΩM,0 = ΩM (t†) = 0.25 (5.10)
ΩΓ(t) ≈ ΩM (t) × 2 × 10−4,
(5.11)

where (5.6) is the Ω equivalent of the strong assumption, (4.1). Hence (5.7)
through to (5.11).

If we compare (5.10) with (5.1), it is clear that the mass weight, MΓ, of
CMB contribution, ΩΓ(t), to the conserved mass contribution MU is way inside
the error limits for ΩM,0. That is to say that as far as mass is concerned,
the CMB could be neglected in relation to the Ω∆ contribution as it makes
no signiﬁcant numerical contribution to the basic structure of the theory or the
integration process used to derive it. However, it does introduce detail internally
to the theory and it is clearly vital to the quantum synthesis of structures story
attached to the theory. It reduces homogeneity in an important and useful way
and, as will be shown, it induces a partitioning of the pressure P (t) in the forms
for the CMB pressure PΓ and the pressure P∆ from the ∆ mass component.
This will be addressed next.

The CMB pressure from equation (4.25) is

PΓ(t) = (a/3)T 4(t),

= EΓ/(3VU (t)),
= MΓc2/(3VU (t)) = ρΓ(t)c2/3.

(5.12)
(5.13)

(5.14)

From (3.13)and following equations the pressure of the dust universe is given
by

P (t) = PG + PΛ ≡ 0 ∀ t.

(5.15)

where both PG and PΛ are oppositely signed but numerically equal absolute
constants. In the previous section, the CMB mass was incorporating into the
theory by partitioning the total mass MU which has been given a ﬁxed numerical
value from experiment into the two parts M∆ and MΓ while keeping the same
constant value for MU . This deﬁnes the ∆ mass, M∆, but otherwise makes no
diﬀerence to the structure of the theory or its correctness as rigorous solution
to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. However, as the value of the pressure, P (t), is
determined by the value within the theory of MU , the non-dark energy part
of the universe mass, the partitioning procedure implies a partitioning of the
non-dark energy part of the pressure P (t) which is PG (5.15) corresponding to
the partitioning of mass, (4.1).

There is an unfortunate anomaly in Friedman cosmology in the perception
of pressure and in the way that it is deﬁned. The pressure term in the Friedman
equations is assumed to arise basically from the gravitational attraction of the
material within the universe. Thus at the universe boundary massive objects

6 ENTROPY OF THE CMB

will be attracted to within the universe by gravitation and this is regarded as
the source of the positive pressure term, P , in the Friedman equations. Thus,
eﬀectively, P , is identiﬁed with the pressure that an inﬂated balloon in equilib-
rium would produce in reaction to the air pressure, −P , within it at equilibrium.
It follows that, for consistency, if there is radiation pressure present within the
universe it should be placed as a contribution to the P (t) term, within the the-
ory, with a negative sign. That is we should write for the induced partitioning
of P (t)

P (t) = PG + PΛ ≡ 0 ∀ t
PG = P∆(t) − PΓ(t)

(5.16)

(5.17)

as the dark energy pressure, PΛ, is not involved being not part of an eﬀect
from the conserved mass of the universe. The pressure, PG, associated with the
gravitational attraction of all the mass within the universe at any time t, as has
been shown earlier, is an absolute constant while PΓ(t) depends on time. Thus
the non-CMB part of the pressure, P∆(t) must also depend on time. Equation,
(5.17) can be written as

1 = P∆(t)/PG − PΓ(t)/PG

rP ΓG(t) = PΓ(t)/PG
rP ∆G(t) = rP ΓG(t) + 1.

The ratios rP ΓG(t) and rP ∆G(t) above give the weight of CMB pressure and
the weight of non-CMB to the total non-dark pressure respectively

Let us now consider the relation between the CMB pressure, PΓ(t), and the

∆ mass density,

PΓ(t) = (a/3)T 4(t),

= EΓ/(3VU (t)),
= MΓc2/(3VU (t)) = ρΓ(t)c2/3
≈ ρ∆(t)c2 × 2 × 10−4/3.

Equations (5.16) and (5.17) together, expressed as

PΓ(t) ≡ P∆(t) + PΛ ∀ t,

gives the important interpretational result that the CMB is in mechanical equi-
librium with the ∆ and Λ masses combined. This is an alternative characteri-
sation of the dust universe property.

6 Entropy of the CMB

We found at equation (4.18) that there is a choice available for deﬁning physical
temperature as a positive or a negative quantity. As we all know, the usual
choice in terrestrial physics is the positive one. This choice is made because S
is a monotonic increasing function of E,

T

> 0.

(6.1)

However, there are also physical theory situations where negative values of
temperature are encountered and accommodated within conventional thermal

6 ENTROPY OF THE CMB

physics. Negative temperatures occur for example in nuclear spin systems. Orig-
inal work on this aspect is associated with the researchers Purcell and Pound
([31],[27]). The second of the previous two references gives much detail about
such systems and explanations of their thermodynamics The condition under
which negative temperature occurs is often considered to be due to the existence
of a sub-system with ﬁnite maximum energy that is in weak interaction with
the rest of the system so that its own temperature can be deﬁned independently
from the rest. The sub-system can then reach equilibrium without being in equi-
librium with the whole system. In statistical mechanics, the process involved
is sometimes referred to as population inversion with the temperature passing
from positive inﬁnity to negative inﬁnity or conversely at the inversion time.
This subsystem property is largely the situation in the cosmological model be-
ing presented here where the sub-system is the CMB which has a constant ﬁxed
total energy EΓ and so its interaction with the whole universe system which
changes markedly with time t must be judged as weak. The property is exactly
fulﬁlled in the present model if, at the singularity time, population inversion
actually takes place with a ﬁnite negative temperature just before time t = 0
and reaching −∞ at the singularity then jumping to +∞ immediately after the
singularity to then descend through ﬁnite positive values to zero as epoch time
advances. Such a singularity event depends theoretically on the temperature
for negative time being chosen also to be negative and as we have seen we have
this option from the theory (4.17). The inﬁnite temperature jump at t = 0
can, as is well known, be avoided if one works with the parameter 1/T instead
of T . This is equivalent to regarding inverse temperature as more physically
signiﬁcant than temperature itself. My feeling is that the idea of a singularity
population inversion taking place at t = 0 is a likely scenario. However, I have
to admit that the choice of negative temperature for t < 0 is speculative in
spite of it apparent very good ﬁt with the mathematics of the present model. In
particular, this assumption does lead to the important conclusion that, if true,
the entropy associated with the CMB steadily increases from t = −∞ → +∞
and, of course, that is what we would like to be the case. Firm decisions about
what happens at the singularity at this time in theory development can only
be speculative. Quantum Cosmology when it arrives may hopefully change the
situation.

Starting at equation (6.2) is a list of the values of the ratio rP ΓG(t) of CMB
pressure to the non-dark energy component component PG of the pressure P (t)
that arises from the ∆ mass, rP Γ∆(t), for fourteen important values of epoch
time, t. This model is time symmetric about the time t = 0, the time of the
singularity. Thus this model has existence before the time t = 0. This is
evident from the form of the radius or scale factor equation, (3.8) provided it is
understood that the square is taken before the cube root is taken in the index
of the sinh function.

rP ΓG(±0) ≈ ∞
rP ΓG(±t1/10) ≈ 6.94625
rP ΓG(±t1) ≈ 0.06493
rP ΓG(±tc) ≈ 0.00012
rP ΓG(±t†) ≈ 0.00002
rP ΓG(±t2) ≈ 2.03 × 10−6
rP ΓG(±∞) = 0

The ratio rP ΓG(t) is a measure of how the CMB mass pressure relates to the PG
mass pressure. Towards the singularity, t = 0, it approaches ∞. The ∆ mass
pressure ratio to PG at the times above is given by adding 1 to the corresponding

7 CONCLUSIONS

values above. Thus towards t = 0 it also approaches ∞. Thus from the pressure
point of view at the singularity there is mechanical equilibrium between CNB
mass and the ∆ mass and Λ mass combined with the contribution from the Λ
mass being negligible (5.25). At the singularity temperature and pressure are
both inﬁnite. This is the equivalent of the idea from big-bang theory that near
the singularity the universe is radiation dominated .

7 Conclusions

The cosmological model developed in A and B and further ampliﬁed here to
show how the thermodynamics of the CMB is included in its structure is rigor-
ously a solution to the full set of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations of general relativity
via the Friedman equations. The model also satisﬁes exactly the recent measure-
ments by the astronomical dark energy workers. The model need not necessarily
be considered to be of the big-bang type because it has a history extending from
t = −∞ to t = +∞. However, if the reader cannot accept or just disagrees
with the existence of the solution before t = 0 being joined to the solution after
t = 0, he or she can simply disregard the negative time phase and stick with the
big-bang idea. The negative time phase can then be dismissed as an unphysical
solution to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. I shall now give a brief account of the time
evolution of the model over the full time range t = −∞ to t = +∞ and mention
a few of the new puzzles thrown up by it. The reader would ﬁnd it helpful to
look at the graphs for velocity and acceleration over this range as I outline the
history of events as the model evolves with epoch. See the ﬁle darkenergy.pdf
[32], presentation to the 2006 PIRT Conference and the list Main Events in
History of the Universe in section 4.

The theory implies the following sequence of steps starting at t = −∞. A
deﬁnite quantity of positively gravitational mass, Mu, at density zero uniformly
distributed over the whole of an inﬁnitely extended spherical three dimensional
Euclidean region of hyperspace is collapsing at a very high speed, v ≫ c, towards
a deﬁnite centre. This is the initial situation. Apart from the fact that this
mentions the kinematics of a spherical boundary moving towards its centre and
as the density of the contents of this collapsing sphere is essentially zero almost
nothing physical is happening. Clearly this initial situation is somewhat like the
big-bang. However, I think it can be given a plausible explanation with a slight
extension of the theory which does not damage its correctness under relativity. I
shall come back to this point at the end of this section. The hyperspace is itself
ﬁlled with a uniform constant unchanging density of negatively characterised
gravitating mass, dark energy from Einstein’s positive Λ. Thus the repulsive
gravitational eﬀect of this material within the descending sphere will cause the
incoming high velocity of the boundary to steadily be reduced until it reaches
from above the value c at the negative time, −t2. All this ﬁrst phase does
present some physical mystery because the boundary motion is superluminal.
However, if this early stage motion can be seen as just kinematic that might
reduce any detraction by this aspect. Similar problems occur in the standard
model. We note that at and above the positive time, t2, we have no information
about what physical processes are taking place except that the mass density
of the universe is very low indeed which is also obviously the case below and
up to the negative time −t2. The next main stage above −t2 and below −t1
is acceptable as within known physics and probably involves physical processes
like those occurring above t1 and below t2. However, it is not necessarily true
that the processes in this range are the time-reversed processes in the time
symmetric range, displayed in the Events in History list. Lastly, in the negative
time range from −t1 to the singularity at 0 we are into a mystery superluminal

range again but this will likely contain events like those in the positive time
range 0 to t1 but with the same caveat as for the previous range. The sequence
of events for the positive time range can be read oﬀ from the Main Events in
History list which takes us to the end of history at t∞ with a very low density
universe sphere with its boundary rushing to inﬁnity with v ≫ c.

Returning to the point raised earlier about understanding the initial state,
we see that the ﬁnal state at +∞ is the same as the initial state at −∞ with re-
versed radial speed of the boundary. This can be given a reasonable explanation
by making a reinterpretation of the 3-dimension hyper-space into which the uni-
verse is contracting and then expanding after the singularity. Suppose that the
original 3D-hyperspace is replaced with a ﬁxed 3D-surface of a 4D-sphere of very
large radius, a well know geometrical trick. Thus the ﬁxed hyper-space becomes
a closed 3D-space. The expanding Universe can then be regarded as expanding
from a point to cover the 4D-sphere surface to some maximum hyper-area and
then to contract back over the adjacent hyper-surface to become a point sphere
again. This is most easily picture by considering the lower dimensional situation,
a circle on an ordinary 3D-sphere surface expanding from a point on the surface
to approaching a great circle at great positive speed away from its start point to
when, after passing the great circle, descends initially at great negative speed to
become an antipodal point. This is just like the kinematic process in the model
is seen to be happening through t = ±∞. This hyper-spherical interpretation is
not part of the model as it stands but it could be incorporated in the structure
without damage to the rigorousness of the model as a solution of the Einstein
ﬁeld equations. We can in fact just use this idea to interpret what is happen-
ing at inﬁnity and then let the radius of the 4D-hypersphere go to inﬁnity. Its
surface then becomes indistinguishable from the original hyperspace.

The main conclusions are that this model for the evolution of the universe has
all the advantages that are found in the cosmological standard model together
with new perspectives on the nature of dark energy and the amount of it that
is present in the background together with a new and clearer representations
for temperature, pressure and entropy.
Importantly, it does not suﬀer from
the serious defect of the standard model of not being deﬁnitely a solution of
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations.

Nature of Gravitation
Dr. A.V. Rykov
Chief of Seismometry lab. of IPE RAS, Moscow, Russia.

The photoeﬀect, (vacuum analogue of the photoelectric eﬀect,) is used to
study the structure of the physical vacuum, the outcome of which is the basis
for an hypothesis on the nature of gravitation and inertia. The source of
gravitation is the vacuum which has a weak massless elementary electrical
dipole (+/-) charge. Inertia is the result of the elastic force of the vacuum in
opposition to the accelerated motion of material objects. The vacuum is seen
as the source of attraction for all bodies according to the law of induction.

The nature of gravitation remains one of the central problems of science
and the discovery of its true basis will introduce major changes to our un-
derstanding of the physical laws. The following hypothesis is a departure
from commonly accepted physical theories. Newton presented the laws of
gravitation and inertia and shows acceleration as absolute in ambient space.
Einstein’s General Theory represents gravitation as the curvature of space
near gravitating masses, and inertia is seen as equivalent to gravitation. In
consideration of the absolute or relative character of acceleration, Einstein
adopted Mach’s theory, in which the property of inertia is seen as the gravi-
tational attraction of all masses in the Universe. This is despite the paradox
that an isolated rotating object should not experience centrufugal forces. It
is commonly acknowledged in physics, that the curvature of space - time
is suﬃcient, and gravitation is not required. However this concept is not
convincing even from a philosophical point of view. The physics of the past
century has continued the methodology of prior centuries which is to search
for answers to problems of HOW? and not WHY?, considering the latter
approach to be religious rather than physical. For example, the Big Bang
generates the whole substance of the Universe from a mathematical point,
presumably under no inﬂuence other than God. The theories view the physi-
cal vacuum as playing an exclusive role in all interactions except gravitation.
Exchange forces are implemented in the vacuum with the help of virtual par-
ticles: photons in electromagnetic interaction, mesons in nuclear forces and
gluons in nucleons. Gravitons as exchange ﬁeld quanta, have not received
suﬃcient development in the quantum theory of gravitation although a sim-
ilar approach to the above is indicated. The nature of gravitation is here
presented as the vacuum composed of massless charge dipoles, one compo-
nent having a small charge superiority over the other. In this manner, it is

ies or bodies separated by large distances in space. An inequality zero of the
sum of charges is shown visually: [(
) is numerically greater than (+).] The
retio of gravitation and repulsion in the universe forms the numerical equality
of Λ -member in Einstein’s theory [1, P. Davis, 1985].

At ﬁrst we’ll remove a blunder of physics presented by Coulomb’s formula.
It lies in the fact that parameters of vacuum were put to the denominator of
formulas for electric and magnetic forces. We’l introduce inverse values:

η = 1

µ = 1.0000000028

107[a2kg−1m−1s2] - is a magnetic constant of
vacuum equal to inverse value of magnetic permeability. ξ = 1
ε = 8.98755179
·
109[a−2m3kg
s−4] - is a dielectric constant of vacuum equal to inverse value
of dielectric permittivity. Newton’s and Coulomb’s formulas get an identical
view. Speed of light gets more logical idea c = √ηξ .

·

Experimental physics presents necessary data for the study of vacuum.
We mean the data on photoeﬀects in vacuum, on nuclei and nucleons [2,Kar-
jakin N.I. and others, 1964]. Let’s remind the values of gamma-quanta ener-
4mec2).
gies: 1, 137, 1836, 3672 MeV (2mec2, 137
This series of energy gives a valuable information for the physical ideas about
the structure of vacuum and matter [3,Rykov A.V., 2001].

Gamma-quantum of ν frequency deforms the structure of cosmic vacuum.
Being within the size of re between its elements, gamma-quantum creates a
deformation ∆re . The deformation energy will be eoE∆re , where eo is
a elementary charge, E - is electrical intensity of the structure. To avoid
a well known experimental noise at real birth of electron+positron pair by
gamma-quantum we shall take the equation of the energy in pure case:

where h - is a Plank’s constant. Deformation is function of time

∆re = ∆[re sin(2πνt)] = 2πνre∆t cos(2πνt) (2).

hν = eoE∆re (1),

Let’s deﬁne the intensity of electrical ﬁeld, where N is some coeﬃcient of

proportionality:

Let’s put the obtained expressions, amplitude from (2) and intensity from

(3) to (1):

E = Nξ eo

We can assume quite naturally that re/∆t = c - is speed of light. Let’s

ﬁnd an unknown quantity:

N = h

orq

where rq = qξ/η . We have got a well known formula of Plank’s constant:

h = 2πe2

oα−1

qξ/η = 6.6260755(40)

10−34 (6).

·

On this stage we should clear a situation with a choice of numerical values
for h or α−1 . All next values are calculated on the base of h. But the α−1 is
in reality more fundamental then h, because the last one is derivative from
eo, α−1, ξ , η - vacuum parameters. The choice made here is based upon this
quite new study of vacuum.

The exact value for ν rb =

the coeﬃcient of elasticity b from a next equation:

Another useful parameter of vacuum will be :

Eσ = √γξ = 0.77440463 [a−1m3s−3] (12) .

The names for this parameters are not yet known.
To that stage we get the main parameters of the vacuum structure. Mass-
less vacuum structure follows the fact that energy required for creation pair of
electron+positron deﬁnites by energy equation w = 2moc2+ 2moc2/137.036
, where 2moc2 went on birth of two particle masses and 2moc2/137.036 went
to break the dipole tie.

Dielectric vacuum media has a tied charges. The moving charge gener-
ates a Maxwell’s displacement current j. This current generates magnetic
strength dH = 1
dE
dt . The H is necessary magnetic compo-
nent to the E for the Electromagnetic wave (light). The vacuum structure
is natural media for light excitation and propagation in space. Thus, the
connected charges - dipoles - are re-translators of an electromagnetic wave.
Light reaching the observer is not the initial phenomenon of a photon emitted
at source, but must be viewed as a multiply-relayed signal.

It is natural to assume that the longitudinal polarization of the dipoles
of space involves gravitational phenomena. Gravitation is explained by the
electrostatic ”ﬁeld”, which is transmitted in vacuo as a longitudinal signal.
The longitudinal motion of the polarized front between connected charges is
not accompanied by the appearance of a parallel magnetic ﬁeld moving in
one direction, and of identical sign.The magnetic strength should in this case
surround the displacement current of moving charges similar to a current in
a conductor. As an electrostatics or gravitation act as central and frequently

4

spherical forces, the total magnetic strength of displacement currents appears
equal to zero for gravitating objects or those charged by static electricity.
The outcome is minimal damping. This infers an extremely large and almost
instantaneous speed of propagation of longitudinal waves in the vacuum. The
universe appears to be an interconnected system in which any part ”feels”
in full unity with the whole.
It is only in this way that it is capable of
existence and development. In essence, cosmology cannot manage without
”instantaneous” gravitational transfer.

It is necessary to state that it is impossible to formally transfer accepted
physical concepts regarding material substance on the structured vacuum as
here indicated. Strength E = ξ q

the calculation of acceleration of gravity for the earth in terms of electrical
forces gives g = √Gξ ρ M
. For instance, The Earth has g = 9, 82 m/cˆ2

and electrical strength E = 1.1402
from the usual point of view. However, it is not surprising that the electrical
1026 V/m. This
strength of an electron is 1.8367
is the medium in which ” the microparticles exist ”, and of which the macro
bodies consist. Distances between the constituents of atoms on 3-4 oder
exceed the indicated distance. The vacuum penetrates everywhere, whether
it is a dielectric or a conductor. Therefore it must be realized that customary
concepts of shielding or electrical voltage are here completely unsuitable. It
is impossible for example, to arrange a conductor between gravitating bodies
to shield the operation of gravity. It is impossible to arrange electrodes in
space to remove and use the electrical voltage of the vacuum. The carriers
of electricity in a substance and in the vacuum are completely diﬀerent. The
interaction of bodies with the vacuum is implemented at the level of electrons
and nucleons of substances. Gravitation also begins at the same level, ﬁnally
being integrated in macroscopic masses.

We state that the force of elastic electrical deformation will be deﬁned as

f = b∆rrb = ξ e2

and b = 1.155065

1019[kg/sˆ2]. (13)

Where b is the factor of electrical elasticity. Charge polarization -

σ = Q/4πR2 [Q/mˆ2](14).

Using formula (11), (14) and g = G M

R2 for the acceleration of gravity we

have:

g = 4π√GξS(∆rg)2 m/sˆ2. (15)

The longitudinal deformation of the vacuum dipoles by a gravitating ob-
ject determines the acceleration of gravity and alternately, the acceleration
of gravity determines the deformation of the vacuum structure. We calculate
the maximum acceleration on (15)and (9):

gmax = 6.3409

1010 m/sˆ2. (16)

·

The force of electroelastic deformation from (9) will be deﬁned by the

maximum acceleration of an unknown mass mx:

b∆rrb = gmaxmx . (17)

The unknown mass is determined from the equation(17)
mx = √αmP l = 1.859459
This gives Q = ρmx = 1.602177

10−19 - the value of the charge of
an electron (!), inadvertently identifying a surprising connection of values
ρ, α, mx, mP l, and that indirectly supports the gravitational theory.

10−9 kg, where mP l - Planck’s mass !

·

·

Mass provides the ability to determine the gear of gravitation through
the availability of a gravitational charge. We now calculate the number
of pairs of electrons and positrons forming vacuum dipoles in this mass:
n = mx/mo = 2.041255321 pieces. From this, the value of the charge is
determined ∆eo = eo/n = 7.848981−41 Q, where the charge of an electron
exceeds the positron charge by: 7.848981−41 Q. For instance, the excess of
negative charges over positive by a factor of 21 is the basis for gravitation.
It corresponds to a minimum gravitational charge of the mass of an electron
or positron, i.e. qg = ρmo = 7.848981−41 Q. We get there another very vivid
coincidence and thus additional prove of validity of description of nature
gravity.

Summary.

For centuries the nature of gravity is being unknown. The gravity was
and is up to now the most mysterious forth of the Nature. It is diﬃcult to
make references to many-many publisched attempts to solve the problem of
gravity.It seems to auther that he ﬁnd a realystic and physicaly based theory
of non-geometric gravitation. Above there are remarkable and unexpected
coincidences that serves as source of auther hope that this article has sense.
Any new theory should expect new knowledge about The Nature.

1)The velocity of gravity is expected almost to be inﬁnitiv. Experiment
on solar tide data in comparison with local sun time should give the estimated
velocity of gravity.

2)There are possibilites to control the deformation of vacuum structure
by electrical and magnetic forces, by gamma-quanta radiation etc. Thus the
gravity and inertia may be controled as the russian scientists Roschin V.V.
and Godin S.M. shows [4,Roschin, Godin, 2000]. There is a tale about won-
derful discs after John R.R.Searl which was taken by the mentioned scientists
for construction of their device.

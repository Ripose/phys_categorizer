THE SCALED UNIVERSE II

Abstract

In an earlier paper we had pointed out that Quantum Mechanical
type eﬀects are seen at diﬀerent scales in the macro universe also. In
this paper we obtain a rationale for this, which lies in the picture of
bound material systems, spanning a Compton wavelength type extent,
separated by much larger and relatively much less dense distances.

1 Introduction

In a previous communication[1] it was shown that the mysterious quantum
prescription of microphysics has analogues at the much larger scale of stars,
galaxies and superclusters. The common feature in all these cases is a Brow-
nian type fractality. We now examine this circumstance in greater detail to
obtain a rationale for this ”Scaled Quantum Mechanical” behaviour.
At the outset it must be observed that in a sense, the universe is not a contin-
uum. Thus within an atom, the nucleus occupies a very tiny fraction of the
volume, roughly ∼ 10−15. Then there is a wide gap till we reach the orbiting
electrons. Similarly there are intermolecular distances, interplanetary, inter-
stellar, intergalactic.... distances which provide relatively huge gaps. This is
not in the spirit of a uniform continuum.
We will now argue that this is because, for example the nucleons are bound
together, so also the electrons and the nucleons are bound together, the
atoms in the molecules are bound together... and so on with subsequent
gaps, which leads to some interesting scale dependent consequences, all this
in the context of a Brownian underpinning.

2 A Rationale for Scaled Eﬀects

The starting point in[1] was the fact that we have the following Random
Walk type Relations:

R ≈ l1qN1
R ≈ l2qN2
l2 ≈ l3qN3
R ∼ l√N

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)
where N1 ∼ 106 is the number of superclusters in the universe, l1 ∼ 1025cms
is a typical supercluster size N2 ∼ 1011 is the number of galaxies in the uni-
verse and l2 ∼ 1023cms is the typical size of a galaxy, l3 ∼ 1 light year is
a typical distance between stars and N3 ∼ 1011 is the number of stars in a
galaxy, R being the radius of the universe ∼ 1028cms, N ∼ 1080 is the num-
ber of elementary particles, typically pions in the universe and l is the pion
Compton wavelength.
On this basis it was argued that we could introduce a ”Scaled” Planck Con-
stant given by

for super clusters;

for galaxies and

h1 ∼ 1093

h2 ∼ 1074

h3 ∼ 1054

(5)

(6)

(7)

for stars.
The relation (4) was observed nearly a century ago by Weyl and Eddington.
It was shown (Cf.ref.[2]) that far from being empirical this relation can be
deduced on the basis of the ﬂuctuational creation of particles from a back-
ground Zero Point Field or Quantum Vacuum, in a scheme which leads to a
cosmology consistent also with Dirac’s large number coincidences[3]. From
this point of view the Random Walk character of equation (4) is not acci-
dental, and this reasoning could be extended to equations (1),(2) and (3), in
the light of equations (5), (6) and (7).
It may be observed that in all these cases we have a length, the Compton

2

wavelength or its analogue which deﬁnes regions of matter separating rela-
tively empty spaces.
Infact it was also argued in[1] that these scaled ”Compton wavelengths” and
scaled ”Planck Constants” arise due to the well known equation of gravita-
tional orbits,

GM

L ∼ v2

(8)

On the other hand equation (8) can be viewed as resulting from the Virial
Theorem[4], where the velocity is replaced by the velocity dispersion.
This velocity v would be diﬀerent at diﬀerent scales. For example for a black
hole it would be the velocity of light, which would then give the Schwarzchild
radius from (8). For galaxies it is ∼ 107cms per second[5]. It is this circum-
stance that produces the above scales leading to fractality.
We could go one step further, because we expect that the same eﬀect would
apply to solar type systems: The planets and other objects are bound quite
close to the sun compared to the interstellar distances. Infact we can verify
that this is so for Kuiper Belt objects which have been studied in the recent
past[6]. In this case a typical size is ∼ 5km, the distances are ∼ 1015cm,
masses are ∼ 1019gms their number is ∼ 1010 while an application of equa-
tion (8) shows that the velocities are ∼ 105cms per second which is indeed so.
It can now be shown quite easily that this deﬁnes a scaled Planck Constant

h4 ∼ 1034

In other words equation (8) characterizes ”Black Holes” with diﬀerent max-
imal velocities.
Incidentally from (8) we could easily deduce that the angular momentum J
is given by

J ∝ M 2

(9)

It is quite remarkable that the equation (9) also applies to elementary parti-
cles and Regge trajectories[7].
Indeed this is no coincidence as can be seen as follows: It was shown that
a pion can be considered to be a bound state of an electron and a positron
within the context of Quantum Mechanical Black Holes[8]. In this case we
have instead of equation (8)

c2

∼

e2
mer

3

(10)

where me is the electron mass.
Whence we have

h ≈ mπcr ∼

e2

× 102
c

∼ 10−27

(11)

It is remarkable that (11) gives us the value of Planck’s constant, given the
pion and electron masses, and at the same time we can deduce an equation
like (9) at the micro level also. Equation (11) is on the same footing as
equations (5), (6) and (7). In this case it is the electromagnetic interaction
which replaces the gravitational interaction in the equation (8).
Thus the rationale for the fractal structure seen above is in bound systems
separated by relatively large and relatively empty spaces.

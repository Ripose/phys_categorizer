A new ”hidden colour hypothesis” in
hadron physics

Abstract

A new ”Hidden Colour Hypothesis” within the framework of QCD, as an
extension of and in keeping with the spirit of the ”Colour Singlet Hypothesis”
is hereby proposed As such it should play a role in a consistent description
of exotic hadrons, like the diquonia, pentaquarks, dibaryons etc. How these
exotic hadrons are aﬀected by this new hypothesis is discussed here. This
new hypothesis suggests that the experimentalists may not be looking for
single exotics but for composites of two or more of the same.

INTRODUCTION

As per the colour conﬁnement hypothesis of QCD only the colour singlet
part of the quark conﬁgurations would manifest themselves as physically
observed particles, All the other representations like the colour octet, though
they arise in qqq and q¯q systems, do not show up as physical particles.
These forbidden conﬁgurations though show up in larger number multiquark
systems to give colour singlet objects themselves. So such components though
missing in simple qqq and q¯q systems actually play a prominent role in large
number of quark colour singlet objects. So to say they are hidden inside
larger colour singlet objects. As such these hidden colour parts ( to be clearly
deﬁned below ) are actually as signiﬁcant as the colour singlet part. No one
has been able to prove the colour singlet hypothesis from the fundamentals
of the QCD. It may become a ”Law” only after it can satisfactorily be shown
to arise from QCD itself. So though no violation of it has been found (
remember that actually the colour singlet idea is ﬁrst an empirical fact then
later only a theoretical concept ) it still retains the preﬁx of ”hypothesis”.

Now to deﬁne the ”hidden colour” concept. The baryons, made up of
three quarks, besides the colour singlet part which shows up in nature ex-
plicitly as per the colour singlet hypothesis, have other forbidden parts like
the colour octet. When one goes to the six quarks then the total composite
system can be colour singlet in the following manner:

6q >=

SS > +

CC >

1
√5|

|

2
√5|

(1)

where S represents a 3-quark cluster which is singlet in colour space and C
CC > is overall colour
represents the same as octet in colour space. Hence
singlet. This part is called the hidden colour because as per conﬁnement
ideas of QCD these octets cannot be separated out asymptotically and so
manifest themselves only within the 6-q colour-singlet system [1].

SOME GROUP THEORY

Let S(f1) and S(f2) be the permutation groups for the particles 1, 2,
....f1 and f1 + 1, f2 + 2, .... f1 + f2, respectively, with f = f1 + f2. We
use the following notation [2] to designate the irreps of the nine groups
Sx(f1).....Sq(f ) and the irreps of SU(m), SU(n) and SU(mn) ( of the group

HIDDEN COLOUR HYPOTHESIS

If colour singlet is so basic to nature, the author feels that the allied
concept of the hidden colour should not be any less important. Hence the
author would like to propose here a new hypothesis. This actually very simply
arises as an extension of the colour singlet hypothesis and in a manner with
physical manifestations opposite to those of the colour singlet hypothesis.
Let us call it the ”Hidden Colour Hypothesis”. As per this hypothesis, in the
ground state or at low excitations, the creation as an independent entity of
a hadron which has a large hidden colour part in its wave function would be
appropriately suppressed. Hence if in a particular conﬁguration in space-time
a particular hadron has large hidden colour component in the state in which
it is expected to exist, then it will be diﬃcult to produce it in the laboratory.
Also if deep inside colour singlet objects, it will manifest as repulsive core in
the appropriate region.

≤

As an application of this hypothesis let us look at deuteron. Most of
the time the two nucleons in deuteron are isolated colour singlet objects.
However when two such nucleons come together to form a bound system like
deuteron, why do they not have conﬁguration where the two nucleons overlap
1f m to form 6-quark bags ? Why is deuteron
strongly in regions of size
such a big and loose system ? The reason has to do with the structure of
the 6-q bags formed had the two nucleons overlapped strongly. At the centre
of mass of the bound system clearly the six quark conﬁguration should be
important. Hence this 80% hidden colour part ( see Table ) would prevent
the two nucleons to come together and overlap strongly. Therefore the hidden
1f m
colour would manifest itself as a short range repulsion in the region
in deuteron. So the two nucleons though bound, stay considerably away from
each other. Hence this new hypothesis is able to explain the basic property
of short range repulsion in nuclear physics.

≤

The hidden colour concept in spite of being successful has had a rough
start. There have been some claims that hidden colour may not be a useful
concept as these hidden colour states can be rearranged in terms of asymp-
totic colour singlet states. But as discussed in literature [3] the hidden colour
concept is not unique only when the two clusters do not overlap strongly and
asymptotically can be separated out. However when the clusters of 3-q each
overlap strongly so that the relative distance between them goes to zero then
the hidden colour concept becomes relevant and unique [3]. We would like to

6

point out that indeed, this necessarily is the situation for deuteron discussed
above. Also note that for the ground state the quark conﬁguration is s6
given by conﬁguration space representation [6] while s4p2 given by [4] does
not come into play as there is not enough energy to put two quarks into the
p-orbital.

Group theoretically the author had earlier obtained the hidden colour
components in 9- and 12-quark systems [4, 5]. For the ground state and low
energy description of nucleons we assume that SU(2)F with u- and d-quarks
is required. Hence we assume that 9- and 12-quarks belong to the totally
antisymmetric representation of the group SU(12)
SU(3)C
SU(2)S where
where SU(3)c is the QCD group and SU(4)SF ⊃
S denotes spin. Note that up to 12-quarks can sit in the s-state in the
group SU(12). The calculation of the hidden colour components for 9- and
12-quark systems requires the determination of the coeﬃcients of fractional
parentage for the group SU(12)
SU(3) [4, 5] which becomes quite
SU(4)
complicated for large number of quarks (see Appendix). The author found
that the hidden colour component [4, 5] of the 9-q system is 97.6% while the
12-q system is 99.8% ie. practically all coloured ( see Table ).

SU(2)F ⊗

A = 3,4 NUCLEI

Where would these 9- and 12-quark conﬁgurations be relevant in nuclear
physics ? The A=3,4 nuclei 3H, 3He and 4He have sizes of 1.7 fm, 1.88 fm
and 1.674 fm respectively. Given the fact that each nucleon is itself a rather
1f m at the centre of these nuclei the
diﬀuse object, quite clearly in a size
≤
3 or 4 nucleons would overlap strongly. As the corresponding 9- and 12-q are
predominantly hidden colour, there would be an eﬀective repulsion at the
centre keeping the 3 or 4 nucleons away from the centre as per the hidden
colour hypothesis above. Hence it was predicted by the author [4, 5] that
there should be a hole at the centre of 3H, 3He and 4He. And indeed, this
is what is found through electron scattering. Hence the hole, ie. signiﬁcant
depression in the central density of 3H, 3He and 4He is a signature of the
hidden colour hypothesis in this ground state property.

NUSOSPIN

1H2 helion (”h”) 3

The author has used this concept of the role of hidden colour in A=3,4
nuclei to predict triton clustering in nuclei [6]. Equally signiﬁcant is the
suggestion of a new symmetry in the same neutron rich nuclei [7]. Herein
triton (”t”) 3
2He1 are treated as fundamental representations
of a new symmetry group SU(2)A [7] which has been christened as ”nusospin
symmetry”. Note that basically this nusospin symmetry arises due to the
application of the hidden colour hypothesis. Clearly the fact that 3Z
Z A2Z
nuclei are made up of Z number of tritons leads to new stability for them.
The author has found extra-ordinary stability manifested by the separation
energy data for the proton and neutron pairs (Z,N): (6,12), (8,16), (10,20),
(11,22) and (12,24) [8]. This also hints at the possibility of neutron stars.

EXOTIC HADRONS

Now let us look at the signiﬁcance of hidden colour for the exotic hadrons
like the diquonia, pentaquarks, dibaryons etc. The recent claims of the dis-
covery of the pentaquark has been much in the news. However even the
discoverers of this exotic states ask for caution in acceptance of the claim.
This should be seen in the light of the lack of exotic states in spite of intense
searches for these in laboratories all over the world these last few decades.
Once in a while a claim is made. But mostly it does not withstand closer
scrutiny as none of these are starred objects in the Particle Data Tables!
This is by and large the story of the exotic baryons. So one may ask as why,
if QCD demands their existence, is it that still we do not have a deﬁnite
candidate for the exotic hadron as of now.

The answer is provided by the new hidden colour hypothesis proposed
here. We have already seen that inside nuclei these hidden colour components
can manifest themselves over a short range near the centre of mass of the
nucleus and there they provide for short range repulsion in two, three nucleon
and four nucleon systems. From the table we notice that these exotic hadrons
also have large hidden colour parts and so if we try to to create these in
these conﬁgurations, it will be resisted. Also in the ground state we feel that
these conﬁguration should be signiﬁcant. Hence in short, the hidden colour
hypothesis says that it will be diﬃcult to create these exotic hadrons and
thereby explaining their reluctance to show up as of now.

8

It should be pointed out that major support for the colour singlet hy-
pothesis comes from the fact that as of now we have not found in free state
any coloured object. So now the fact that as of now we have not found a
deﬁnite candidate for exotic hadrons, should be taken as a proof or strong
motivation for the hidden colour hypothesis. One exception may be the pen-
taquark. But in that case as per the table in one particular case the hidden
colour part is only 33 per cent. The small resistance may be bypassed by
some ingenious experimentation. However one possible prediction of this hy-
pothesis is that as the individual multiquarks have large hidden colour parts
within them it may be that two or more multiquarks of the same kind may
like to form a composite as then they may have many more ways of forming a
colour singlet hadron. So perhaps the experimantalists should look for these
objects as clusters of two or more of the same kind of multiquarks.

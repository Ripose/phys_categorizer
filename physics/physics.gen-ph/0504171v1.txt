ON SERINI’S RELATIVISTIC THEOREM

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. I expound here in a more detailed way a proof of an impor-
tant Serini’s theorem, which I have already sketched in a previous Note.
Two related questions are brieﬂy discussed.

1. - Introduction

In the Note “On the beams of wavy metric tensors” [1] I sketched a simple
and concise proof of an important Serini’s theorem (1918). Serini’s original
demonstration was subsequently generalized by Einstein and Pauli (1943)
and by Lichnerowicz (1946) (see [2]). Independently, a diﬀerent proof was
given by Fock [2bis].

I wish now to expound again, in a more detailed way, my proof of the
above theorem, and to solve an apparent contradiction with the main result
of the paper “Regular solutions of Schwarzschild problem” [3]. The Appen-
dices contain some remarks concerning the so-called gravitational waves.

2. - The theorem

Serini’s theorem aﬃrms the non-existence of regular (i.e. without sin-
gularities) time independent solutions of Einstein ﬁeld equations for the
perfectly empty space, Rjk = 0, (j, k = 0, 1, 2, 3), that become pseudo-
Euclidean at spatial inﬁnity. The unique time independent solution of
Rjk = 0 is the trivial solution gjk = const. Thus, in the time indepen-
dent case, Rjk = 0 imply Rjklm = 0, the vanishing of Riemann curvature
tensor of the spacetime manifold.

3. - Proof of the theorem

a) As it was remarked by Hilbert [4], we can always choose a Gaussian
normal (or synchronous [5]) system of coordinates for the solution of any
relativistic problem. In their treatise [5] Landau and Lifchitz explain in a
detailed way the interesting properties of this reference system. I shall follow
their treatment, but with some slight diﬀerences of notations.

A Gaussian normal (or synchronous) reference frame can be deﬁned by

the conditions:

g00 = 1,

g0α = 0,

(α = 1, 2, 3);

accordingly:

ds2 = (dx0)2 + gαβ(x, x0)dxαdxβ;

putting gαβ ≡ −hαβ, we have:

(2′)

ds2 = (dx0)2 − hαβ(x, x0)dxαdxβ.
It is easy to see that the time lines coincide with the spacetime geodesics.
Henceforth, all the operations of index displacement and covariant derivative
concern only the three-dimensional space with the metric tensor hαβ. If

the components of the Ricci-Einstein tensor Rlm, (l, m = 0, 1, 2, 3), are:

and therefore, as an immediate consequence of eqs. (6), (6′), (7), (7′),

Rlmrs = 0,

q.e.d.;

the unique time-independent solution of Rlm = 0 is glm = const. This
result is obviously quite intuitive, because the curvature of spacetime is
created by matter, and if the matter is absent . . . –

(Remark that the above proof does not require the hypothesis that gjk is

pseudo-Euclidean at spatial inﬁnity.)

4. - An apparent contradiction

At the ﬁrst sight, it seems that Serini’s theorem denies, in particular,
the existence of those regular solutions of Schwarzschild problem – i.e., of
the problem to determine the gravitational ﬁeld of a point mass at rest
– which have been exhibited in paper [3]. However, the contradiction is
only apparent: indeed, all forms of solution of Schwarzschild problem are in
reality relative to a matter tensor Tjk diﬀerent from zero, and precisely: to a
matter tensor involving a Dirac delta-distribution [6], or to the matter tensor
of the limiting case of a concentrated mass, according to Fock’s procedure
[7], which was also followed in [3].

APPENDIX A

In sect.3. of paper [1] I have given an intuitive demonstration of the
physical unreality of the gravitational waves (GW’s). I have considered there
a spatially limited train L of running (hypothetical) GW’s – the source of
which is at spatial inﬁnity –, satisfying exactly the equations Rjk = 0. (It
was implicitly assumed that the gjk’s of L do not possess any singularity
of any kind whatever.) Then, the proof rested on a characteristic property
of general relativity (GR), that distinguishes it from Maxwell theory: the
absence of any limitation to the velocities of the reference frames. Thus,
we can ideally consider an observer Ω, who moves together with our train
L. For Ω the metric tensor of L is time independent; consequently, Serini’s

4

theorem tells us that its Riemann curvature tensor is zero: the GW’s of L
are mere coordinate undulations.

Of course, this demonstration of the physical non-existence of GW’s is a
little bold. But there exist absolutely trenchant proofs, as e.g. the proofs of
the non-existence, in the exact formulation of GR, of “mechanisms” capable
of generating GW’s, in primis the fact that the purely gravitational motions
of bodies are geodesic [8]. Quite generally, even the non-purely gravitational
motions cannot generate GW’s, see [9].

A last remark. One could object that – as a matter of fact – there are
wavy solutions of Einstein equations Rjk = 0, the curvature tensor of which
is diﬀerent from zero. Answer : i) all solutions of Rjk = 0 do not possess
an energy-momentum endowed with a true tensor character: accordingly,
they are unphysical objects; ii) any undulatory character can be obliterated
by a sequence of suitable coordinate transformations; iii) the mathematical
existence of wavy solutions of Rjk = 0, having a curvature tensor Rjklm 6= 0,
can be easily understood:
it owes its
computative existence to a given gravity source S (explicitly or implicitly
postulated) at a very large distance from an ideal observer [10]. Of course, W
retains “memory” of the spacetime curvature produced by S – for a detailed
and analytical corroboration of this statement, see e.g. the treatment given
by Fock in Ch. VII of his book [2bis]; on the other hand, no motion of a
gravity source, no cataclysmic disruption of it can give origin to GW’s, as
it has been proved.

let W be a solution of this kind;

APPENDIX B

The analogy between Maxwell e.m. theory and Einstein general relativity
is a misleading analogy. This is, in particular, clariﬁed also by the intuitive
proof of the non-existence of physical GW’s, which I have recalled in App.A.
In his splendid Autobiographisches [11], at page 53, Einstein emphasized the
following paradox of classical time conception, which was discovered by him
when he was only 16 years old: “Wenn ich einem Lichtstrahl nacheile mit
der Geschwindigkeit c (Lichtgeschwindigkeit im Vacuum), so sollte ich einen
solchen Lichtstrall als ruhendes, r¨aumlich oszillatorisches elektromagneti-
sches Feld wahrnehmen. So etwas scheint es aber nicht zu geben, weder auf
Grund der Erfahrung noch gem¨aß den Maxwell’schen Gleichungen.” In the
English translation by P.A. Schilpp: “If I pursue a beam of light with the
velocity c (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam of
light as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic ﬁeld at rest. However, there
seems to be no such thing, whether on the basis of experience or according to
Maxwell’s equations.” Now, in general relativity the paradoxical character
of the above consideration disappears if in particular the beam of light is
substituted by a beam of (hypothetical) GW’s:
indeed, in GR there is no
limitation to the velocity of the reference frames.

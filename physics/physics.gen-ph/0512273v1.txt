1 Physial (cid:16)Laws(cid:17) and (cid:16)Data(cid:17)

The founder of the first physial theory Isaa Newton gave to it some pattern of the offiial

dotrine aepted in his Trinity College. Beginning with Newton's mehanis all physial theories

remember to a some extent the Christian theory of a human soul being in two kingdoms :

a

kingdom of laws and a kingdom of wills.

In any physial theory, a kingdom of laws is a set of equations of motion obtained by varying

an ation. A kingdom of wills is assoiated with a set of initial data whih Laplae still required

for unambiguous solutions of the Newton equations in order (cid:16)to explain the World without God(cid:17).

The initial data are measured by a set of physial instruments (identified with a frame of

referene) and are given by a will of experimenters or Lord-God at the beginning of the Universe.

Laws of nature do not depend on the initial data but results of appliation of these laws an

depend. The Newton equation of a train does not depend on the initial data, i.e. on the will of

a passenger of this train who hose his initial position and the speed of the train, but the final

result of the solution of this equation is a onsequene of both the will of the passenger and the

law of nature.

In ontrast to mathematiian Laplae, physiist Newton understood that in any explanation

of the Design and Purpose in the Universe physiists should take into aount both the kingdoms

of laws and (cid:16)data(cid:17) given in a onrete frame of referene where the Universe was reated.

This frame is identified by modern observers with the Cosmi Mirowave Bakground (CMB)

radiation distinguished by its dipole omponent in the frame of an Earth observer. Who hose

this frame at the time of formation of CMB when an Earth observer was only in the Projet?

Formulations of Eistein's General Relativity and quantum field theory in a onrete frame

were fulfilled by the founders of modern physis (for details see [1℄ (cid:21) [5℄)

. Now I present here

1

the results of our attempts with my ollaborators [7℄ (cid:21) [15℄ to use these formulations, in order to

desribe the reation of the Universe in the framework of modern physial theory in agreement

with observational data.

2 Ation and Interval as (cid:16)Foundations of Physis(cid:17)

The offiial dotrine aepted in Trinity College (cid:16)In the beginning was the Word ..., and the

Word was God(cid:17) (John 1:1) an be onsistent with the modern physis, if God an be visible

due to His ation. The (cid:16)ation(cid:17) of the unified theory was restored by both experimentalists

and theoretiians in the 19th and 20th enturies in the ontext of the field nature of matter

and spae-time in the form of a sum of Hilbert's ation of the Einstein General Relativity [17℄

and the ation of the Weinberg - Salam - Glashow Standard Model of elementary partiles [18℄

settled in the Riemannian spae-time defined by a geometri interval. Sientists believe in that

equations of motion obtained by varying this ation and supplemented by the initial data in a

onrete frame an explain the origin of the Universe. What does a (cid:16)onrete frame(cid:17) mean in

the modern theories?

1

Studying these formulations in [6℄ (cid:21) [15℄ I was an eye-witnesser of that at the beginning of the 1970s theoreti-

ians in the high energy physis lost kingdom of data beause they restrited quantum (cid:28)eld theory by desribing

mainly sattering proesses that do not depend on frames. This independene gave an essential simpli(cid:28)ation

of the proof of renormalizabillity ((cid:28)niteness) of the Standard Model marked by the Nobel Prize to t'Hooft and

Veltman [16℄. But the Nobel Prize is not an argument to lose the historial pathway of the frames of referene

beginning with Copernius until Dira [3℄ and Shwinger [4℄.

2

3 A Frame for Constrained (cid:16)Data(cid:17)

In General Relativity (GR) and quantum field theories, a onrete frame was introdued by

Dira, Heisenberg and Pauli, Fermi, Shwinger, and other physiists until the 1960s on the level

of the ation (see [1℄ (cid:21) [5℄) beause it was the most straight path to separate equations of motion

from a set of onstraints between the initial data

. These onstraints of the data in all modern

2

relativisti theories are prinipally new elements in omparison with the Newton mehanis.

A ontemporary olleague of Newton in Trinity College ould find that the onstrained

relativisti systems and (cid:16)straight(cid:17) frame-ation path led to the offiial Trinity dotrine rejeted

by Isaa Newton

in his dramati disussion with the founders of this dotrine

.

4 Newton's dotrine versus the (cid:16)Trinity(cid:17) one

4.1 Two (cid:16)desriptions(cid:17) of one Relativisti Objet

David Hilbert's formulation of GR

in a onrete frame of referene an be an effetive illustration

5

of the adequateness of the Trinity dotrine to desription of any relativisti systems (partile,

string, universe in GR).

In order to demonstrate this adequateness, let us onsider the problem of measurements of the

life-time of an unstable partile being in a relativisti train moving with veloity 200 thousands

km/s. If a Driver of the train measures its life-time 10 s, then a Pointsman at a railway station

measures 14 s (see Fig. 1). What is a orret life-time, 10 s or 14 s?

Two different times of the same partile is ontradition, in the Newton dotrine

.

In the next years, when the frame dependene of the physial results were onsidered as nonessential, frames

were established on the level of equations of motion. Really, the frame-equation path does not di(cid:27)er from

the (cid:16)straight(cid:17) frame-ation one, if we restrit tasks of theoretial physis by desription of sattering proesses of

elementary partiles in the framework of the standard perturbation theory [19℄. I am onvined that the (cid:16)straight(cid:17)

frame-ation path leads to results that essentially di(cid:27)er from the frame-equation path ones, if we desribe olletive

phenomena of the type of bound states [6, 7℄, the string spetrum, and osmi evolution in GR [14℄.

Introduing the standards of onsistent mathematial proof into physis in terms of lear absolute notions

Newton was looking for the sense of these notions in Arian theology, trying to get out of the Trinity College

dotrine whih preahed relativism and logially inonsistent trinity. One an think that for Newton as a member

of Trinity College at Cambridge University this situation was a paradox [20℄.

One of the founders of the Trinity theology Basil the Great revealed limits of the onsistent Aristotle's logi

(see [21, 22℄) whih antiipated the famous G(cid:4)odel theorems formulated in the 20th entury for formal arithmetial

systems:

i. Any onsistent desription of a system is not omplete,

ii. Any omplete desription of a system is not onsistent [23℄.

Here onsistent means the absene of logial ontraditions. The theologial deed of Basil the Great was the

positive onstrutive generalization of the onsistent Aristotle's logi, in ontrast with the negative G(cid:4)odel theorems.

Basil's generalization of Aristotle's logi an be formulated as a ontinuation of the (cid:28)rst two G(cid:4)odel theorems:

iii. Any omplete desription of a system with logial ontraditions beomes onsistent in a new meaning,

if there are simultaneously two (or more) desriptions of the system onneted by relationships, so that two opposite

assertions about the same system belong to two their di(cid:27)erent desriptions.

In the year of elebration of the 90th anniversary of GR we an now distinguish Einstein's treatment of

general oordinate transformations (who onsidered them as generalization of the frame transformations [24℄)

from Hilbert's variation approah to GR [17℄, where the general oordinate transformations are onsidered as

di(cid:27)eomorphisms of the GR ation and a geometri interval. There is an essential di(cid:27)erene between the frame

group of the Lorentz (cid:21) Poinar(cid:1)e-type [25℄ leading to a set of initial data and the di(cid:27)eomorphism group of general

oordinate transformations restriting these initial data by onstraints. This di(cid:27)erene was revealed by two N(cid:4)other

theorems [26℄. The formulation of GR in terms of the Fok simplex [27℄ de(cid:28)ned as a di(cid:27)eo-invariant Lorentz vetor

helps us to separate di(cid:27)eomorphisms from transformations of frames of referene.

Resolving the Newton equation (the aeleration is equal to zero) one an (cid:28)nd a tra jetory of the train, i.e.

the time dependene of the oordinate of the train X(t) = XI + VI t, where VI is a ratio of the momentum P and a
mass m. The passenger an hoose another frame with other data, but the time of a partile in all frames will be
unique and absolute, as it was postulated by Newton in his mehanis with the energy ENewton(P ) = P 2/(2m).

Figure 1: At the top of Fig.1 a relativisti train is depited with an unstable partile. The life-time

of this partile is measured by two observers, by a Pointsman and a Driver. Eah of the observers has

his time: Pointsman - variable X 0

, and Driver - geometrial interval η (and his wave funtion). At the

bottom of the figure there is an image of the universe where eah observer has two sets of measurable

quantities orresponding to two observers of the partile. To the Pointsman there orresponds a field

set of measurable quantities (mass ϕ saled by the osmologial sale fator and density of a number
of partiles), and the Driver (cid:21) geometrial set of measurable quantities (time interval η and initial

data) [10, 11, 13℄.

Two different times of the same partile are desribed by two different ations given in two

different frames, in the Einstein-type intermediate dotrine

, where the relation between these

7

two times is only a kinemati one, but not a onsequene of dynami equations of motion.

Two different times of the same partile and their relation as a onsequene of dynami

equations of motion are desribed by one Hilbert's geometro-dynami ation given in one onrete

frame, where there is a bifuration of the lassial time into two different times (time-variable

measured by a Pointsman and time-interval measured by a Driver) of the same objet. Isaa

Newton ould know in this bifuration the Trinity dotrine, beause these two times belong to

two different desriptions (here the dynami and the geometri) of the objet by the same ation

in the same frame

.

8

The Hilbert geometro-dynamis of a partile leads not only to Einstein-type theory with the

energy explaining nulear proesses, but also predits an antipartile with a negative energy

known as a Dira positron and reveals the historial pathway of quantum field theory (the main

tool of high energy physis in the 20th entury) beause the quantum field theory is nothing,

7

Lorentz, Poin(cid:1)are, and Einstein saw that eletrodynamis was onsistent with mehanis, where the train had

the tra jetory X(X0) = XI + (P/E)X0 , and the energy E(P ) = √m2 + P 2
nulear energetis. If an observer hooses another frame, the time X0 onverts into another one mixing with the

. This energy revealed and explained

oordinate by the kinemati Lorentz transformation justi(cid:28)ed by the symmetry of the Maxwell eletrodynamis.

This fat of hanging time is one of relativisti e(cid:27)ets meaning that eah frame has its own time of a partile.

8

In order to give the dynami desription of the relativisti relations, one should onsider the time X0 as one

but primary and seondary quantizations of the energy onstraint, in order to remove a negative

energy and to make a partile stable. However, the quantum field theory uses only a time-

variable measured by an external observer (i.e. a Pointsman) being out of a partile.

4.2 Hilbert's Geometro-Dynamis of the Universe

In the Universe given in a onrete frame, an observer is simultaneously a Driver and a Points-

man. To the Pointsman there orresponds a field set of measurable quantities (the osmologial

sale fator

onsidered as a time-like variable and densities of matter), and the Driver (cid:21) geomet-

9

rial set of measurable quantities (time-interval and initial data). In this ase, geometro-dynami

relation between the time-variable and time-interval

is just the famous Hubble law: the further

a star, the more redshift of the star photons. As the osmologial sale fator is the time-variable,

10

11

its momentum is the energy of the Universe

in the field spae of events. In suh the Einstein (cid:21)

Hilbert GR the osmi evolution is onsistent with primary and seondary quantizations of the

energy onstraint

justified by the experiene of the high energy physis the 20th entury. These

12

quantizations gave the desription of the reation of the Universe and its geometri time and

matter from the physial vauum

[10, 11, 14, 15℄ in satisfatory agreement with observational

13

data, if we hose the relative units [9℄.

4.3 Relative Units

The osmi dynamis of the Universe was revealed in General Relativity by Alexander Friedmann

[30℄ who kept in the Einstein interval only a osmologial sale fator and resolved equations of

motion in this ase. However, the interpretation of this osmi dynamis as the expansion of

the universe is possible only in the Newton dotrine of absolute units, if we propose that our

standards belong to the kingdom of laws.

In aordane with the Trinity dotrine [21, 22℄, a man is free to hoose his standard himself,

beause we an ognize only a ratio of things. If a measurement is one of the tools of ognition,

the Trinity dotrine means that we an measure any physial quantity only in units of another

physial quantity aepted as a standard

.

14

Defining a measurable interval of the length as the ratio of a Friedmann-like interval to the

standard one that also belongs to Friedmann-like intervals, one an see that the measurable

interval of the length is not expanding, as it does not depend on the osmologial sale fator.

9

In GR, the osmi evolution is extrated by a sale transformation gµν = a2

Maxwell revealed that the desription of results of experimental measurement of eletromagneti phenomena

by the (cid:28)eld theory equations depends on the de(cid:28)nition of measurable quantities in the theory and the hoie

of their measurement standard. In the introdution to his (cid:16)A Treatise on Eletriity and Magnetism(cid:17) Maxwell

wrote: (cid:17)The most important aspet of any phenomenon from mathematial point of view is that of a measurable

quantity. I shal l therefore onsider eletrial phenomena hie(cid:29)y with a view to their measurement, desribing the

methods of measurement, and de(cid:28)ning the standards on whih they depend.(cid:17) [31℄.

Figure 2: The Hubble diagram [9℄ in ases of the absolute units of standard osmology (SC) and the

relative ones of onformal osmology (CC). The points inlude 42 high-redshift Type Ia supernovae [32℄

and the reported farthest supernova SN1997ff [33℄. The best fit to these data requires the dominane

of the osmologial onstant density (70%) and 25% of the Cold Dark Matter density, in the ase of

the Friedmann standard osmology, whereas for the relative units these data are onsistent with the

dominane of density of a free salar field (85%± 10%) with the square root dependene of the sale

fator on onformal time (that orresponds to the stiff state) [9, 34℄.

Really, the sale fator disappears from the relative measurable interval, but not from the

equations of motion. The equations of motion ontain the Friedmann osmologial sale fator

as a measure of all masses. It was shown [9, 10, 11, 13℄ that the relative units give a ompletely

different physial piture of the evolution of the universe than the absolute units of the standard

osmology. The spetrum of photons emitted by atoms from distant stars billion years ago

remains unhanged during the propagation and is determined by the mass of the onstituents at

the moment of emission. When this spetrum is ompared with the spetrum of similar atoms

on the Earth whih, at the present time, have larger masses, then a redshift is obtained.

The temperature history of the expanding universe opied in the relative units looks like

the history of evolution of masses of elementary partiles in the old universe with a onstant

temperature of the osmi mirowave bakground. The relative observable distane loses the

osmologial sale fator a, in omparison with the absolute one. Therefore, in this ase, the

observational redshift (cid:21) oordinate-distane relation [32, 33℄ orresponds to the dominane of the

stiff state of free salar field with the square root dependene of the sale fator on onformal

time [9℄ (see also Fig. 2). Just this time dependene of the sale fator on the measurable time

(here (cid:21) onformal one) is used for desription of the primordial nuleosynthesis [35℄.

4.4 Eletro-Weak Epoh versus the Plank one

Thus, the relative units dotrine leads to a single stiff state for all epohs inluding the reation

of a quantum universe at the beginning. In terms of the relative units the Plank mass loses

its status as the fundamental parameter of the equations of motion and beomes the present-

probability of this osmologial reation due to their mass singularity at the moment when their

Therefore, the Universe was a fatory of W-,Z-vetor bosons at the beginning. The observational

geometro-dynamis allows us not only to restore the historial pathway of physial desription

of the Universe evolution but also to use experiene of quantum field theory formulation verified

by the high energy physis experiments. We gave here a set of numerous arguments in favor

Thus, the papers of the founders of modern physis [1, 3, 17, 24, 27℄ allow us to restore the

historial pathway of physial desription of the Universe evolution in a onrete referene frame

with the definite initial data in the unified theory like the desription of the trajetory of a

relativisti partile after its quantum reation from stable vauum. This onrete frame reveals

the trinity of times in GR: i) the unmeasurable oordinate time in Hilbert's ation as an objet

of general oordinate transformations (i.e., diffeomorphisms), ii) the diffeo-invariant geometri

time-interval measured by our wath, and iii) the time-like variable as the osmologial sale

fator measured by astrophysial observations and onsidered as a measure of the Universe

evolution in the field spae of events, where the Universe was reated [8℄ (cid:21) [15℄.

One an say that modern physis goes beyond the bounds of the Newton Arian dotrine

aepted by modern theoretiians [38℄ who have a possibility to ontinue the Newton dialogue

with the founders of the Trinity dotrine [21, 22℄. Who is a man in the Universe? He is

a passenger who lost his referene frame in the (cid:16)frame-free(cid:17) method, who uses only absolute

units and parameters of the (cid:17)natural(cid:17) laws inluding the (cid:16)absolute Plank mass(cid:17), and annot

determine unambiguously the energy of the Universe? Or he is a Driver, who knows his frame

and plae, hooses his relative units, measures the initial data, introdues new onepts and

hanges his logis as one of the tools of his ognition, who is able to determine the Universe

energetis, desribes its reation, and is responsible for its further fate, as he has his free (cid:16)will(cid:17),

in order to take part in further reation of the measurable world and to have an eternal life of

his unmeasurable soul in the kingdom of His will ?

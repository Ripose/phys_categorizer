Abstract

In this note we consider a variable G cosmology which is consis-
tent with observation and which had successfully predicted an ever
expanding accelerating universe. It is shown that the observed short-
ening of the orbital periods of binary pulsars is also in good agreement
with this model.

In an earlier communication [1], it was shown that a varying G cosmology

T being the age of the universe, about 15 billion years, correctly gives the
precession of the perihelion of Mercury. In this model particles are created
out of the Quantum Vacuum in an inﬂationary scenario type phase transition.
This model has been discussed in detail in the references cited [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
and other references therein.
In this cosmology at a given point of time,
within an uncertainty time interval τ of the order of the Compton time of
the typical elementary particle viz., the pion given N particles, √N particles
are created from the Quantum Vacuum, whence

Apart from other routine eﬀects like the bending of light, the cosmology cor-
rectly predicted an ever expanding accelerating universe besides explaining
many hitherto inexplicable features like the so called large number coinci-
dences, the mysterious pion mass Hubble constant Weinberg relation and
several other features as discussed in the references.
We would now like to show that this model also explains the observed de-
crease in the orbital period of the binary pulsar PSR 1913 + 16, otherwise
attributed to as yet undetected gravitational waves [7].
In general in schemes in which G the universal constant of gravitation de-
creases with time, it is to be expected that gradually the size of the orbit and
the time period would increase, with an overall decrease in energy. It may
be mentioned that cosmologies in which the constant of gravitation G varies
with time have been considered in slightly diﬀerent contexts also [8, 9]. In
any case all this becomes more relevant in the light of latest observations that
the ﬁne structure constant varies with time which also ﬁnds an explanation
[10, 11].
But in the present case as we will show, the gravitational energy of the binary
system, GM m
remains constant, where M is the mass of the central object
and L the mean distance between the objects. This is because the decrease
in G is compensated by an increase in the material content of the system,
according to the above model.
In fact the energy lost is given by GM
T L (per unit mass of the orbiting object -
in any case the mass of the orbiting object does not feature in the dynamical
equations), on using (1). Further as can be seen from (2)
T particles
appear from the Quantum Vacuum per second, per particle in the universe.
So the energy gained in this process is GM
T L per second. This follows, if we
write M = n
m, where n is the number of typical elementary particles in
the central body and m their mass.
As can be seen from the above the energy lost per second is compensated
by the energy gained and thus the total gravitational energy of the binary
system remains constant.
Let us now consider an object revolving about another object, as in the case
of the binary pulsar [12]. The gravitational energy of the system is now given
by,

We take ˙µ to be a constant, in view of the fact that G varies very slowly, as

Using (7), (8) and (9), a little manipulation gives

(7) and (10) show that there is a decrease in the size of the orbit, as also in
the orbital period. Before proceeding further we note that such a decrease
in the orbital period has been observed in the case of binary pulsars [7, 13].
Let us now apply the above considerations to the case of the binary pulsar
PSR 1913 + 16 observed by Taylor and co-workers (Cf.ref.[13]). In this case

Indeed (11) is in good agreement with the carefully observed value of η
(Cf.refs.[7, 13]).
Finally it may be remarked that this same eﬀect has been interpreted as
being due to gravitational radiation, even though there are some objections
to the calculation in this case (Cf.ref.[13]).

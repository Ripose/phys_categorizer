Abstract

Macroscopic derivation of the entrainment in in a Andreev-Lifshitz Supersolid induced by

a surface elastic wave propagating along the ﬂexible interface is conducted by considering the

nonlinear coupling between the interface and the rarefaction eﬀect. We obtain the critical bounds

for zero-volume-ﬂow-rate states corresponding to speciﬁc rarefaction measure and wave number

which is relevant to the rather small critical velocity of supersolid ﬂows reported by Kim and Chan.

In 1969, it was conjectured by Andreev and Lifshitz1 that at zero temperature, delocal-

ized defects may exist in a quantum solid, as a result of which the number of sites of an

ideal crystal lattice may not coincide with the total number of particles. Originally, this

conjecture was proposed for three dimensional quantum solids made of atoms (3He, 4He,

· · ·) which do not interact via Coulomb repulsion. The proposed supersolid phase is believed

to occur due to the quantum behavior of point defects, namely vacancies and interstitials, in
this crystal of bosons2−3. Researchers have found that a small lattice model does not exhibit

the mesoscopic signature of an intermediate phase separating the solid from the liquid, where

the solid and the ﬂuid would coexist4. Such a vacancy-solid phase was indeed suggested1 by

Andreev and Lifshitz if the zero point motions of certain defects become suﬃcient to form

waves propagating inside the solid.

Castaing and Nozi`eres have later considered5 such a possibility for spin polarized 3He. The

statistics of the defects depend on their nature. For simple vacancies in the crystal, their

statistics is given by the statistics of the particles out of which the solid is made. If the

defects are bosons, they may form a condensate, giving rise to a superﬂuid coexisting with

the solid. This supersolid phase is discussed in certain bosonic models6. If the defects are

fermions, they may form a Fermi liquid7 coexisting with the solid, such that the system

is neither a solid, nor a liquid. Two kinds of motion are possible in it; one possesses the

properties of motion in an elastic solid, the second possesses the properties of motion in a

liquid. This interesting issue motivates our present study.

Early theoretical work by Andreev and Lifshitz1 and Chester2 showed that solids may feature

a Bose-Einstein condensate of vacancies (or interstitial atoms) and thus possess superﬂuid

(SF) properties. Quite recently one description of the quantum solid is as a density wave
that has formed in the quantum ﬂuid8−9. The periodicity of this density wave need not

match precisely to the particle density, so that the ground state may be incommensurate,

with unequal densities of vacancies and interstitials. Whether or not the same is true for

quantum ﬂuctuations is not clear at this point. We noticed that previous theories imply a

corresponding vacancy contribution to the speciﬁc heat that is as large as the phonon contri-

bution near 1 Kelvin3,10. Based on these considerations or phenomenological approaches, in

this letter, we shall demonstrate that wavy ﬂexible interface (between atoms and free vacan-

cies or defects) or highly-pressured environments8 can produce elastically deformed interface

or peristaltic motion will induce time-averaged transport in a Andreev-Lifshitz supersolid.

Theoretical studies of interphase nonlocal transport phenomena which appear as a result of

a diﬀerent type of nonequilibrium representing propagation of a surface elastic wave have
been performed before11−12. These are relevant to particles ﬂowing along deformable elastic

slabs with the dominated parameter being the Knudsen number (Kn = mean-free-path/Ld,

mean-free-path (mfp) is the mean free path of the particles, Ld is proportional to the dis-
tance between two slabs)13−15. The role of the Knudsen number is similar to that of the

Navier slip parameter Ns(= µS/Ld; S is a proportionality constant as us = Sτ , τ : the shear

stress of the bulk velocity; us : the dimensional slip velocity; for a no-slip case, S = 0, but

for a no-stress condition. S = ∞, µ is the viscosity).

We shall choose a periodic domain to simplify our mathematical treatments. The ﬂat inter-

face is presumed. We adopt the macroscopic or hydrodynamical approach and simplify the

original system of equations (related to the momentum and mass transport) to one single

higher-order quasi-linear partial diﬀerential equation in terms of the unknown stream func-

tion. In this study, as the temperature is rather low and the phase is related to the supersolid

(there might be weakly friction or shearing dissipation in-between) we shall assume that the

governing equations are the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations which will be associated
with the microscopically slip velocity boundary conditions along the interfaces13−15. To con-

sider the originally quiescent environment for simplicity, due to the diﬃculty in solving a

fourth-order quasi-linear complex ordinary diﬀerential equation (when the wavy boundary

condition are imposed), we can ﬁnally get an analytically perturbed solution and calculate

those physical quantities, like, time-averaged transport or entrainment, critical forcing cor-

responding to the freezed or zero-volume-ﬂow-rate states.

We consider a two-dimensional region of uniform thickness. The ﬂat-plane boundaries or

interfaces are rather ﬂexible and presumed to be elastic, on which are imposed traveling

sinusoidal waves of small amplitude a (possibly due to quantum ﬂuctuations). The vertical

displacements of the upper and lower interfaces (y = Ld and −Ld) are thus presumed to be

η and −η, respectively, where η = a cos[2π(x − ct)/λ], λ is the wave length, and c the wave

speed. x and y are Cartesian coordinates, with x measured in the direction of wave propa-

gation and y measured in the direction normal to the mean position of the interfaces. We

have a characteristic velocity c and three characteristic lengths a, λ, and Ld. The following
variables based on c and Ld could thus be introduced : x′ = x/Ld, y′ = y/Ld, u′ = u/c,
v′ = v/c, η′ = η/Ld, ψ′ = ψ/(c Ld), t′ = c t/h, p′ = p/(ρc2), where ψ is the dimensional

stream function, u and v are the velocities along the x- and y-directions; ρ is the density, p

is the pressure. The primes could be dropped in the following. The amplitude ratio ǫ, the

wave number α, and the Reynolds number Re (representing the weakly friction or shearing

dissipation using a viscosity ν) are deﬁned by ǫ = a/Ld, α = 2πLd/λ, Re = c Ld/ν. We shall

seek a solution in the form of a series in the small parameter ǫ : ψ = ψ0 + ǫψ1 + ǫ2ψ2 + · · ·,
∂p/∂x = (∂p/∂x)0 + ǫ(∂p/∂x)1 + ǫ2(∂p/∂x)2 + · · ·, with u = ∂ψ/∂y, v = −∂ψ/∂x. The 2D
(x- and y-) momentum equations and the equation of continuity16−17 could be in terms of

the stream function ψ if the p-term is eliminated. The ﬁnal governing equation is

and other higher order terms. Microscopic boundary conditions imposed by the symmetric
motion of the interfaces and the non-zero slip velocities13−14 are : u = ∓ Kn du/dy, v =

±∂η/∂t at y = ±(1 + η), here Kn=mfp/Ld. The boundary conditions are expanded in

powers of η and then ǫ. These equations, together with the condition of symmetry and

a uniform (∂p/∂x)0, yield : ψ0 = K0[(1 + 2Kn)y − y3/3], K0 = Re(−∂p/∂x)0/2, ψ1 =
{φ(y)eiα(x−t) + φ∗(y)e−iα(x−t)}/2 , where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. A

substitution of ψ1 into Eqn. (3) yields

or if originally the environment is quiescent : K0 = 0 (this corresponds to a free pumping

φy(±1) ± φyy(±1)Kn = 0, φ(±1) = ±1. Similarly, with ψ2 = {D(y) + E(y)ei2α(x−t) +
E∗(y)e−i2α(x−t)}/2 , we have much more complicated equations (cf. Chu in [17]) and the

boundary conditions

are related to α, ¯α, and Kn (cf. Chu in Ref. 17).

To obtain a simple solution which relates to the mean transport so long as only terms of

O(ǫ2) are concerned, we see that if every term in the x-momentum equation is averaged over

an interval of time equal to the period of oscillation, we obtain

where Dy(y) = Π0y2 + a1y + a2 + C(y), and together from the expression of ψ2, we can

obtain C(y) which also depends on the α, ¯α, Re, ci, i = 0, 1, 2, 3 (cf. Chu in Ref. 17). In

realistic applications we must determine Π0 from considerations of outlet conditions of the

slab-region. a1 equals to zero because of the symmetry of boundary conditions.

Once Π0 is speciﬁed, our solution for the mean speed (u averaged over time) of super-
ﬂow is U = ǫ2Dy/2 = ǫ2{C(y) − C(1) + R0 − Kn Cy(1) + Π0[y2 − (1 + 2Kn)]}/2 where R0
= −{[φyy(1) + φ∗

yyy(1)]}/2. To illustrate our results clearly, we adopt

yy(1)] −Kn[φyyy(1) +φ∗

U(Y ) ≡ u(y) for the time-averaged results with y ≡ Y in the following.

Our numerical calculations conﬁrm that the mean streamwise velocity distribution (aver-

aged over time) due to the induced motion by the wavy elastic interface in the case of free

(vacuum) pumping is dominated by R0 (or Kn) and the parabolic distribution −Π0(1 − y2).

R0 which deﬁnes the boundary value of Dy has its origin in the y-gradient of the ﬁrst-order

streamwise velocity distribution. Note that the Reynolds number here is based on the wave
speed. The physical trend herein is also the same as those reported before13−14,17 for the

slip-ﬂow eﬀects. The slip produces decoupling with the inertia of the wavy interface.

Now, let us deﬁne a critical reﬂux condition as one for which the mean velocity U(Y ) equals

to zero at the center-line Y = 0. With the equation of U, we have Π0cr = Re(∂p/∂x)2 =
−[α2Re2F (0)/200 + Kn C′(1) − R0]/(1 + 2Kn) which means the critical reﬂux condition is

reached when Π0 has above value. Pumping against a positive forcing greater than the crit-

ical value would result in a backward transport (reﬂux) in the central region of the stream.

This critical value depends on α, Re, and Kn. There will be no reﬂux if the pressure gradient

is smaller than this Π0. Thus, for some Π0 values less than Π0cr , the superﬂow will keep

5

moving forward. On the contrary, parts of the ﬂow will move backward if Π0 > Π0cr .

As reported in Ref.

8, the rather small critical velocity (≤ 20µm/s) observed shows

an apparent dissipation or attenuation of the superﬂow. Thus, we present some of the

values of Π0(α, Re; Kn = 0, 0.1) corresponding to freezed or zero-volume-ﬂow-rate states
(R 1

−1 U(Y )dY = 0) in Table 1 where the wave number (α) has the range between 0.10 and
0.90; the Reynolds number (Re)= 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100. We observe that as Kn increases from

zero to 0.1, the critical Π0 decreases signiﬁcantly (cf. Fig. 1). For the same Kn, once Re is

larger than 10, critical reﬂux values Π0 drop rapidly and the wave-modulation eﬀect (due to

α) appears. The latter observation might be interpreted as the strong coupling between the

interface and the inertia of the streaming superﬂow. The illustration of the velocity ﬁelds

for those zero-ﬂux (zero-volume-ﬂow-rate) or freezed states are shown in Figure 2. There

are three wave numbers : α = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8. The Reynolds number is 50. Both no-slip and

slip (Kn=0.1) cases are presented. The arrows for slip cases are schematic and represent the

direction of positive and negative velocity ﬁelds.

Some remarks could be made about these states : the transport being freezed in the time-

averaged sense for speciﬁc dissipations (in terms of Reynolds number which is the ratio of

wave-inertia and viscous shearing eﬀects) and wave numbers (due to the wavy interface or

vacuum ﬂuctuations) for either no-slip and slip cases. Meanwhile, the time-averaged trans-

port induced by the wavy interface is proportional to the square of the amplitude ratio

(although the small amplitude waves being presumed), as can be seen in Eqn. (5), which is

qualitatively the same as that presented in Ref. 11 for analogous interfacial problems.

In brief summary, the entrained transport (either postive or negative and there is possibility

: freezing) due to the wavy interface is mainly tuned by the Π0 for ﬁxed Re. Meanwhile,

Π0cr depends strongly on the Knudsen number (Kn, a rarefaction measure) instead of Re

or α. These results (cf. Table 1 and Fig. 1) might explain why there are rather small

critical velocities for superﬂows in the temperature range where a supersolidity is observed8.

Finally we like to stress that once the phase is solid then the elastically tensile stress should

be larger than that of the liquid phase and the latter could be a crucial test for the existence

of the supersolidity.

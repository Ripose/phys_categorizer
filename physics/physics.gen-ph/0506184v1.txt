Abstract

A derivation of the electric ﬁeld intensity and of the magnetic induction generated by a uniformly moving
point charge is presented. The derivation is in accordance with the fact that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
of moving charge are propagating from the charge with speed c in empty space. The derivation is tailored
for a special audience who knows the transformation of space, time and ﬁelds and Coulomb’s law in the rest
frame of the point charge. It avoids the use of Maxwell’s equations and the concept of retarded potential.

Introduction

Most university-level introductory physics text-books[1], [2] and higher level books[3], [4] present the problem
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds generated by an uniformly moving point charge. The problem can be stated
as follows: Consider a point like charge q located at the origin O′ of the K ′(X ′, Y ′, Z ′, O′) reference frame and
at rest relative to it. Reference frame K ′ moves with constant speed ~V relative to the K(X, Y, Z, O) reference
frame in the positive direction of the overlapped OX(O′X ′) axes. The axes of the two reference frames are
parallel to each other. At the common origin of time in the two frames (t = t′ = 0) the origins O and O′ of
the two frames are shortly located at the same point in space. Observers from K ′ detect the presence of a time
independent (static) electric ﬁeld described by Coulomb’s law. Find out the ﬁeld generated by the same charge
as detected from the K reference frame.

The problem has a long history that starts with the expressions for the electric ﬁeld intensity ~E and for
the magnetic induction ~B generated by a point charge moving with constant velocity ~V obtained by Oliver
Heaviside [5](1888)

where ~r is the distance between the point where the measurements of ~E and ~B take place and the charge,
representing the angle between ~r and ~V .

Jeﬁmenko [6] reviews the diﬀerent ways in which (1) and (2) can be derived. The derivations involve con-
cepts like retarded scalar and vector potentials (the Lienard-Wiechert potentials) [7], [8], integrals for retarded
potentials of a moving charge distribution [9], [10], generalized time-dependent Biot-Savart and Coulomb ﬁeld
laws [11], [12] and Coulomb ﬁeld laws. All the mentioned ways to derive (1) and (2) present a high degree of
complexity being hard to teach without mnemonic aids.

Special relativity theory oﬀers a simple derivation of (1) and (2) [1], [2], [3], [4]. It based on the Lorentz-
Einstein transformations for coordinates, time and ﬁelds. From a pedagogical point of view the teaching of the
subject oﬀers the opportunity to stress the importance of the concept of event and same event.

Resnick [1] oﬀers a solution of the problem we have stated considering the point M ′(x′, y′, z′) of the K ′

frame where the point-like charged particle generates the time independent electric ﬁeld intensity

Let t’ be the time when an observer R′(x′, y′, z′) performs the measurement being located at the point
M ′(x′, y′, z′). Let R(x, y, z) be an observer of the K frame shortly located in front of observer R′ when both
measure the electric ﬁeld intensity and the magnetic induction, the ﬁrst at a time t the second at a time t′. The
events associated with the measurements are S(x, y, z, t) in K and S′(x′, y′, z′, t′) in K ′. Considering that the
space-time coordinates of events S and S′ are related by the Lorentz-Einstein transformations, we ensure the
fact that they refer to the same event. Using the transformations for the components of the ﬁelds we obtain
that the electric ﬁeld intensity ~E measured by observers from K is given by

resulting that observer R of the K frame detects a time dependent electric ﬁeld intensity and magnetic induction
as well.

2 The electric and magnetic ﬁelds relative to the retarded position

Consider the point charge q located at t′ = 0 at the origin O′. According to the classical electromagnetic
theory the information about the creation of the ﬁeld propagates with the same velocity c in all directions, start-
0(0, 0, 0)in K’). The event ”observer R′
ing from O′ at a time t′ = 0 (Event S′
)” detects
and measures the electric ﬁeld intensity is characterized by the space-time coordinates S′(x′ = r′ cos θ′, y′ =
r′ sin θ′, t′ =

arrives at the location of R′. The electric ﬁeld intensity as measured by R′ is given by (1). Its components are

The magnetic induction detected by R is

Rosser [13] derives (16) and (17) establishing a relationship between the lengths of the position vectors
that deﬁne the position of the point where the measurements are performed from the ”retarded position” and
the ”present position” of the ﬁeld producing charge and using the transformation of ﬁelds.

Jeﬁmenko [6] derives (17) and (18) based exclusively on general electromagnetic ﬁeld equations without
making use of transformation equations. The derivation is not very simple and not transparent enough making
its teaching hard without using mnemonic aids.

The derivation of the electric ﬁeld intensity and of the magnetic induction of a point charge detected from
a reference frame relative to which it moves with constant velocity we have presented above is based on the
knowledge of transformation equations for coordinate, time and ﬁelds. As compared with other derivations
which use or do not use special relativity our derivation can be considered as a ”two line” one.

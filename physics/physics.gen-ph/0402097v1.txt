Cremonian Space-Time(s) as an Emergent Phenomenon

Abstract

It is shown that the notion of fundamental elements can be extended to any, i.e. not necessarily homaloidal,
web of rational surfaces in a three-dimensional projective space. A Cremonian space-time can then be
viewed as an emergent phenomenon when the condition of “homaloidity” of the corresponding web is
satisﬁed. The point is illustrated by a couple of particular types of “almost-homaloidal” webs of quadratic
surfaces. In the ﬁrst case, the quadrics have a line and two distinct points in common and the corresponding
pseudo-Cremonian manifold is endowed with just two spatial dimensions. In the second case, the quadrics
share six distinct points, no three of them collinear, that lie in quadruples in three diﬀerent planes, and
the corresponding pseudo-Cremonian conﬁguration features three time dimensions. In both the cases, the
limiting process of the emergence of generic Cremonian space-times is explicitly demonstrated.

Although the theory of Cremonian space-time, ﬁrst introduced in [1], is relatively new, it has
already proven to be remarkably fertile and attracted attention of both the lay public [2] and
specialists [3] alike. The concept not only oﬀers us a feasible explantion for why our Universe is,
at the macroscopic scale, endowed with three spatial and one time dimensions [1,4–7], but also
indicates unsuspected intricacies of a coupling between the two [6]. Moreover, it gives us important
qualitative hints as for a possible underlying algebraic geometrical structure of a large variety of
non-ordinary forms of psychological time (and space) [6,8]. These fascinating properties alone are
enough to realize that the theory deserves further serious exploration.

One of the most natural and fruitful ways of getting a deeper insight into a(ny) theory is to relax
one (or several) assumptions that the theory is based on and see what structural and conceptual
changes such a step involves. In order to pursue this strategy in our case one has to recall the
underlying geometrical principle behind our concept of Cremonian space-time: the existence of
a homaloidal web of (quadric) surfaces in a three-dimensonial projective space, P3 [1,4,5]. An
if a) it
aggregate of surfaces (of any order, not necessarily quadratic) in P3 is homaloidal [1,9]:
is linear and of freedom three (i.e. contains a triple inﬁnity of surfaces), b) all its surfaces are
rational, and c) any three distinct members of the set have only one free (variable) intersection.
The generalized theory outlined in what follows is based on abandoning the last assumption, i.e.
on allowing any three distinct surfaces of the web to have two (or more) points in common.

Of the couple of diﬀerent types of homaloidal web of quadrics we have so far dealt with we shall
ﬁrst consider that whose corresponding Cremonian space-time was found to mimic best the basic
observed macroscopic properties of the Universe, viz. a web whose base conﬁguration comprises a
(straight-)line and three distinct, non-collinear points, none incident with the line in question [1,6].
So, in this case, any web of quadrics that features a base line and where the number of isolated
base points falls short of three may serve our purpose.

We shall, naturally, focus on the case where there are just two base points as this case represents,
obviously, the smallest possible deviation from the “homaloidity” condition. In order to facilitate
our reasoning, we shall choose a system of homogeneous coordinates ˘zi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, in which the
equation of base line,

L, reads

B1 and

B2, coincide, respectively, with the vertices V1 and V2

L :

˘z1 = 0 = ˘z2

and the two isolated base points,
of the coordinate tetrahedron, i.e.

b

B1 : ̺˘zi = (1, 0, 0, 0),

b
B2 : ̺˘zi = (0, 1, 0, 0),

where ̺ is, in what follows, a non-zero proportionality factor. Now, employing the equation of a
generic quadric, D, of P3,

D ≡

dij ˘zi ˘zj = d11 ˘z2

1 + d22 ˘z2

2 + d33 ˘z2

B1 and

B2 is given by

d12 ˘z1˘z2 + d13 ˘z1 ˘z3 + d14 ˘z1 ˘z4 + d23 ˘z2 ˘z3 + d24 ˘z2˘z4 = 0,

where each d’s may acquire any real value. This aggregate is, however, not a web for it eﬀectively
depends on four, instead of three, parameters. In order to get a web from it, a linear constraint has
to be imposed on the parameters d’s. As d12 6= 0 – otherwise the aggregate would contain another
base line (the ˘z3 = 0 = ˘z4 one) – this constraint can be written, without any loss of generality, in
the form

d12 = κ1d13 + κ2d23 + κ3d14 + κ4d24,

(6)

where κi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are regarded as ﬁxed constants. After substituting the last equation into
Eq. (5), we get the web desired

≡ ϑ1 ˘z1(˘z3 + κ1 ˘z2) + ϑ2 ˘z2(˘z3 + κ2 ˘z1) + ϑ3 ˘z1(˘z4 + κ3 ˘z2) + ϑ4 ˘z2(˘z4 + κ4 ˘z1) = 0,(7)

where we simpliﬁed the notation by putting d13 ≡ ϑ1, d23 ≡ ϑ2, d14 ≡ ϑ3 and d24 ≡ ϑ4.

At this point we recall the deﬁnition of a Cremonian space-time as a conﬁguration composed
of the totality of fundamental elements associated with a homaloidal web [1,4–7]. A fundamental
element of a given homaloidal web is any algebraic geometrical object (a curve, or a surface)
In
whose only intersections with a member of the web are the base elements of the latter [9].
the case of quadrics, the fundamental elements are of two distinct kinds, namely lines and conics,
and form pencils, i.e.
linear, singly-parametrical aggregates/systems. A pencil of lines is taken
to generate/represent a macroscopic dimension of space, while that of conics – time. From its
deﬁnition it readily follows that the concept of a fundamental element, and so that of a Cremonian
space-time, is not tied solely to homaloidal webs, but it can be extended perfectly to any web
whatsoever! A crucial property of fundamental elements is that they are located on the Jacobian
surface of the web [9], i.e. on the surface formed by the totality of vertices of the cones contained
in the web; or, what amounts to the same, the totality of singular points of degenerate/composite
quadrics in the web.

Our forthcoming task is thus to ﬁnd the form of the Jacobian surface, J , for the web given by

Eq. (7). From the above-given properties it follows that given a generic web of quadrics,



its J is the locus of points satisfying the following equation [9]

It is a quite straightforward task for the reader to verify that the fundamental elements of web (7)
are, in a general case, located only in the planes ˘z2 and ˘z1; in both the cases these elements are
lines forming pencils centered, respectively, at

the two aggregates being located, as expected, in the two sheets of D

rephrased as follows. The “pseudo-”, or “proto-”Cremonian conﬁguration associated with a generic

“classical” Cremonian space-time [1,3,6], endowed with an additional space dimension (
3 (ϑ))
Q⊙(ϑ)), whenever the web becomes homaloidal. This phenomenon can be given another
and time (
nice geometrical picture. We may regard κi’s as homogenous coordinates of a variable point in
an abstract three-dimensional projective space. Eq. (15) (or, equivalently, Eq. (16)) then deﬁnes a
quadric surface in this space and the “homaloidity” condition simply answers to the fact that the
point happens to fall on this quadric.

In order to get a deeper insight into the nature of this “emergence phenomenon”, we shall

consider a web of quadrics through the following six distinct points:

B1 : ̺˘zi = (1, 0, 0, 0),

B4 : ̺˘zi = (κ, 0, 0, 1),

B2 : ̺˘zi = (0, 1, 0, 0),

B3 : ̺˘zi = (0, 0, 1, 0),
b

B5 : ̺˘zi = (0, κ, 0, 1),
b
B6 : ̺˘zi = (0, 0, κ, 1),
b

where κ is a variable real parameter. These points are, obviously, all real, lying in quadruples in
three diferent planes and no three on the same line. The web they deﬁne is of the form

b

W ♠(ϑ) = ϑ1 ˘z2˘z3 + ϑ2 ˘z1 ˘z3 + ϑ3 ˘z1 ˘z2 + ϑ4 ˘z4(˘z1 + ˘z2 + ˘z3 − κ˘z4) = 0

and its Jacobian reads

J ♠ = 2˘z1 ˘z2 ˘z3(˘z1 + ˘z2 + ˘z3 − 2κ˘z4) = 0.

Although the Jacobian features four distinct planes, in a general case, κ 6= 0, only three of them
carry sets of fundamental elements. These are the planes ˘z1 = 0, ˘z2 = 0 and ˘z3 = 0, and the
corresponding fundamental elements are conics in the following pencils:

Q1(ϑ) : ˘z1 = 0 = ϑ1 ˘z2 ˘z3 + ϑ4 ˘z4(˘z2 + ˘z3 − κ˘z4),

[5,9]. Although this emerging Cremonian space-time features three time dimensions (

a single spatial one (
serves as an important illustration of the intricacy of the coupling between the extrinsic structure
of time (i.e. the type of a pencil of conics) and the number of spatial coordinates. For the three time

i.e. a pencil endowed with four distinct base points, while those of the limiting Cremonian sibling,

L⊙(ϑ), entails serious structural changes in all the three time coordinates. This feature

dovetails nicely with what we found for strictly homaloidal transitions [6], characterized, however,
by a drop in the number of spatial dimensions.

From this reasoning it is obvious that a Cremonian space-time is a rather exceptional structure,
whose emergence is of a fairly complex nature. Following the strategy employed above, it should
represent no diﬃculty for the interested reader to examine other potential transitions, in partic-
ular those where pseudo-Cremonian conﬁgurations feature only a ﬁnite (or even zero) number of
elements.
Insights might also be obtained from an analysis of (pseudo-)Cremonian space-times
associated with webs of cubic and/or higher order surfaces. All this implies a wealth of additional
possibilities to those outlined in [7] regarding “Cremonian” scenarios of how our Universe might
have come into being. Here, we are confronted with a fascinating possibility that the Universe may
have spent a substantial fraction of its life-time in some pseudo-Cremonian regime and acquired its
current generic “quadro-cubic” Cremonian form [1,6,7] only “relatively recently”. This intriguing
scenario will be examined in more detail in a separate paper.

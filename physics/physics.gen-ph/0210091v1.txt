Abstract

In this speculative note some of the conceivable options of supercavitation in the vacuum of quantized

ﬁeld theory are discussed. The resulting modes of propagation could in principle be faster than the velocity

of light in unbounded space-time.

Supercavitation is a phenomenon by which an object travels almost frictionless with high ve-

locities inside a gas bubble surrounded by a liquid [1]. So far, supercavitation has mostly been

applied to military use.

Whereas folklore claims that relativity theory excludes any sort of ether, the general theory of

relativity [2, 3] and quantum ﬁeld theory [4] conceptualize entities, often called “ground state,”

“vacuum,” or “empty space,” which resemble the pre-relativistic “mechanic” ether in many re-

spects. Thus it is not totally unreasonable to speculate that an analogous phenomenon might also

occur in the quantum ﬁeld theoretic vacuum.

The main issues of supercavitation seems to be to (i) reach and (ii) maintain this state, with the

additional desideratum of (iii) ﬂight, in particular direction, control. Let us therefore ﬁrst discuss

conceivable options for the formation of “bubbles of exotic vacuum,” and then proceed to their

maintenance and guidance.

As regards the initial stage of reaching an environment which might be capable of supercavi-

tating, one candidate would be the formation of a Casimir vacuum between conducting plates [5],

which, due to boundary conditions, lacks certain modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. As a conse-

quence, the radiative corrections and the associated renormalized physical entities such as mass,

anomalous magnetic moment [6] and the index of refraction [7] are modiﬁed. The refractive index
n(w ) < 1 (w
indicates dependence on photon frequency) decreases relative to the refractive index
in unbounded space (taken to be unity here), making possible velocities of light v = c/n(w ) > c

higher than the speed of light in unbounded vacuum c.

Another possibility would be to consider a squeezed vacuum, or an environment which is char-

acterized by superluminally “moving” charge-current patterns; i.e., synchronized arrays of charges

acting similar to phase array radar systems. Maybe also certain divergences of rotating electro-

magnetic ﬁelds could be utilized [8].

The maintenance and steering of supercavitation in the quantum ether remains an open ques-

tion. In the case of a cavity in which a Casimir vacuum is conﬁned it is unclear if this cavity can

be engineered to become a dynamical one. So far, mostly static problems have been considered;

with perfectly conducting, ﬁxed walls. It may happen, though, that, due to mirror charges or other

effects, the boundary of this cavity can become a dynamical interface.

It is an often heard belief that superluminal transfer of information or travel of objects and

agents would result in time paradoxes; since then it would be feasible in certain relativistic co-

ordinate frames to “reverse the ﬂow of time,” to “travel to the past,” and what not. Yet, many

2

chronology protection schemes and remedies of different sorts have been proposed for these sce-

narios [9, 10, 11, 12], which may make such concerns less troublesome.

A caveat: Let me, instead of a summary, reiterate that this note is very speculative and contains

remotely conceivable options for supercavitation in the quantum ether. I am aware that this appears

to be impossible to realize with today’s scientiﬁc and technological means. Nevertheless, if our

ancestors had never dreamed of possibilities of sailing faster then the wind or rafting quicker than

the currents, then we might not be able to cross the continents, let alone to leave our planet.

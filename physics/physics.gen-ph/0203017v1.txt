A run of preliminary experiments was carried out to
check the prediction of possible gravitational ﬁeld gen-
eration process arising by stopping of charged massive
particles in a substance predicted by the recently devel-
oped Extended Space Model (ESM) [1, 3].

ESM is a model of the extended (1+4)-dimensional
space G(T ; ~X, S) with the interval S as the ﬁfth co-
ordinate. Certainly, these ﬁve coordinates satisfy the
relation (ct)2 − x2 − y2 − z2 − s2 = 0 . In addition to the
Lorentz transformations (T ; ~X) in (1+3)-dimensional
Minkowski space, in ESM there exist two other trans-
formations in the planes (T ; S) and ( ~X; S). They con-
vert massive particles into massless ones and vice versa.
We also considered the energy-momentum-mass (1+4)D
space G′(E; ~P , M ) = (E/c; ~p, mc) which is conjugated
to the time-coordinates-interval (t; x, y, z, s) (1+4)D
space, and thus a mass m in 5D space G′(E; ~P , M )
corresponds to the interval s in 5D space G(T ; ~X, S).
The coordinates in (1+4)D space G′(E; ~P , M ) satisfy
the relation E2 − c2p2

z − m2c4 = 0 .

x − c2p2

y − c2p2

Note that this model diﬀers from the analogous 5D
theory developed in [6], in which mass is considered as
the ﬁfth coordinate in 5D time-coordinate-mass (mat-
ter) space. In such an approach it is impossible to build
energy-momentum tensor due to mixing of mass coor-
dinate with time and spatial coordinates.

In the proposed ESM the well-known energy-momentum

P (1 + 3) = (E/c; px, py, pz) = (E/c; ~p) in
Minkowski space M (T ; ~X) is transformed to the 5-
vector ¯P (1 + 4) = (E/c; ~p, mc) in the extended space
G(T ; ~X, S) and becomes null for 5-vectors of a massive
particle at rest (mc;~0, mc) as well as for a massless
particle (¯hω/c; ¯hω~k/c, 0) (here ~k is the unit vector in
the particle propagation direction).

The basic predictions of general relativity can also
be obtained in ESM. For instance, the following gravi-
tational eﬀects have been considered in [5]: the planet
escape velocity, starlight redshift and deﬂection, and re-

tardation of radar echo from Mars. It has been shown
that it is possible to obtain the same formulae as in
the general theory for the magnitudes of these eﬀects in
quite another way in the framework of ESM.

According to the ESM conception, any external in-
ﬂuence applied to any material object can be described
as a change in the appropriate refractive index n at
the location of this object (the introduction of a refrac-
tive index for the gravitational ﬁeld is well known, see,
e.g., [7]). A change in the refractive index causes reduc-
tion of energy, momentum or mass of the object. For-
mally, in ESM such a process is described by rotations
in the planes (T ; ~X), ( ~X, S) and (T ; S). We suppose
that the weak gravitational ﬁeld of a central massive
body generates the refractive index n(r) = 1 + γM/rc2
in space (where γ is the gravitational constant). The
refractive index n(r) depends on the gravitational ﬁeld
strength. This refractive index determines the motion of
both massless (photons) and massive particles in space.
Taking into account the appearance of a refractive in-
dex in space around a massive body, we then apply the
technique of rotations in 5D extended space to calculate
various interactions of external bodies with the gravita-
tional ﬁeld.

Let us, for instance, brieﬂy show the way of ob-
taining the second space velocity in ESM. A massive
body at rest is described in our model by the 5D vector
mc(1;~0, 1). The motion of a massive body in the gravi-
tational ﬁeld along the x-axes can be considered in the
extended space G(T ; ~X, S) as a motion in the plane
( ~X, S). Consider the motion of this massive body from
a point where the gravitational ﬁeld is absent (where the
refractive index is n = 1 ) to a point with the refractive
index n(r). This motion is described in EMS by the
Euclidean rotation of a 5D vector in the ( ~X, S) plane:

mc(1;~0, 1) → mc(1; − sin ψ, cos ψ)

The velocity of this particle v = c · cos ψ , hence the
refractive index equals n = c/v = 1/ cos ψ [1].

Thus the total velocity gained by a massive particle

is

Here we took into account that in the case of a weak
gravitational ﬁeld n(r) ≃ 1 . This value coincides with
the escape velocity if we substitute the radius of the
Earth as r .

In the framework of ESM, the 5-current ¯ρ = (ρ,~j.js)
ρ = (ρ,~j) as well
is built instead of the 4-current
as the 5-vector potential (ϕ, ~A, AS) instead of (ϕ, ~A).
With this 5-vector potential it is possible to build ﬁeld
strength tensor ||Fik|| whose components are calculated
in the usual way as Fik = ∂Ai/∂xk − ∂Ak/∂xi , i, k =
0, 1, 2, 3, 4 . In the new 5 × 5 tensor we have not only
the usual electromagnetic components Ex = F10, Ey =
F20, Ez = F30, Hx = F32, Hy = F13, Hz = F21 , but
also the new components Q = F40, Gx = F41, Gy =
F42 , and Gz = F43 . We relate the vector ~G to the
gravitational ﬁeld.

In addition, the 5×5 second-rank energy-momentum-
mass tensor ||T ik|| is built in ESM [8] in the same way
as the 4 × 4 energy-momentum tensor is built in the
usual (1 + 3)D ﬁeld theory. The ||T ik|| components can
be found from the ||Fik|| components by well-known
formula

i, k, l, m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 .

Besides, an extended set of the Maxwell equations
has been obtained [1,2]. This set connects the ﬁeld
strength with the 5-current that gives birth to the ﬁeld.
In empty Minkowski (1+3) space M (T ; ~X) (S = 0),
the ﬁelds are independent. But when we deal with a
material medium, which means that the parameter S
becomes nonzero, the two electromagnetic ﬁeld and a
new ﬁelds ~G and Q form a uniﬁed ﬁeld, and their com-
ponents can interact with each other.

If we rotate 5D vectors, which correspond to 5D-
particles in ESM, in the plane (T ; ~X), this rotation leads
to mixing the particle momentum and the mass. On
the other hand, the rotation in the plane (T ; S) mixes
mass with energy, while the rotation in the plane ( ~X, S)
mixes momentum with mass.

Further on, we can apply such rotations to the 5D
vector potential (ϕ, ~A, AS), the ﬁeld tensor ||Fik||, and
the ﬁelds ~E , ~H , ~G , Q . The ﬁelds ~E , ~H , ~G , Q can
formally be converted into each other under the same
transformations in the planes (T ; ~X), (T ; S) and ( ~X, S)

[1, 2]. The transformation rules are described by in-
troducing the parameters ~v , vs , ~u . These parameters
determine the transition from one frame of reference to
another [1, 2, 9]:

1) rotation in the (T ; ~X) plane is characterised by a

velocity ~v , and the transformations of ﬁelds are

transformations are

3) rotations in the plane (S, ~X) are characterised by
the parameter ~u , and this vectorial parameter describes
reduction of the refractive index n as a result of motion
in the direction of ~u ; the ﬁelds are transformed accord-
ing to the relations

So, we see that the electromagnetic and gravitational
ﬁelds can be converted to each other under the corre-
sponding transformation in the planes (T ; ~X), ( ~X, S),
(T ; S).

In particular, when a moving massive charged par-
ticle is decelerated, falling into an external ﬁeld or sub-
stance, it can produce a gravitational ﬁeld. Such trans-
formation of ﬁelds could, in principle, take place during
various nuclear processes such as gamma or neutron de-
excitation, pair annihilation or formation and so on.

To check this qualitative prediction, the following
experimental setup has been proposed and recently re-
alized. A relativistic 30 MeV electron beam of average
power 450 W from a microtron is stopped in condensed
material (e.g., a tungsten plate). A torsion pendulum
with two massive parts 4 kg each and rather a long trans-
verse rod (120 cm) is used to measure the emerging grav-
itational ﬁeld. One of the pendulum shoulders is set very
close to the stopping target — a possible source of the
gravitational ﬁeld created by the electrons’ deceleration,
and another shoulder is apart from it. As usual, reﬂec-
tion of a laser beam (He-Ne laser with 632.8 nm wave-
length) from a mirror mounted on a shoulder is used
to detect the possible pendulum deﬂection. The light
spot from the mirror is observed on a screen located
5 m apart from the mirror and is registered by a vide-
orecording system with 15-fold optical gain to increase
the measurement accuracy. The accelerator setup gives
us a possibility, very useful for such a type of experi-
ment, of stopping the electron beam as well in another
target, located near the opposite part of the pendulum
shoulder, which could drive the pendulum rotation in

another direction. A more detailed description of the
experiments can be found in Refs. [2, 4].

The ﬁrst tentative experimental results show that
there is a correlation between switchin on the electron
beam and the mean deviation of the pendulum from its
equilibrium position as compared with a control run be-
fore and after the switch. It was also found that the de-
viation direction varies depending on which of the pen-
dulum loads was near the stopping target. An additional
evaluation was made by various methods of statistics, to
prove that the deviations detected are statistically au-
thentic. Thus, by the Pearson criterion, the probability
of conﬁdent statistical distinction between the results of
control measurements of pendulum oscillations as com-
pared with the phases of exposure of a stopping target to
relativistic electrons exceeds 99 %. The force that could
cause a displacement of the equilibrium position of the
pendulum was also evaluated. The deﬂecting force was
estimated to be between 10−8 N and 10−6 N.

We carefully checked experimentally various possi-
ble sources which could cause the pendulum deviations:
mechanical vibrations due to operation of water and air
pumps, magnetic and electric dc and ac ﬁelds, electriza-
tion of diﬀerent parts of the installation. It was found
that all these sources could not cause the pendulum ro-
tation.

Certainly, these ﬁrst experimental results on check-
ing the ESM predictions are of preliminary nature and
require much more substantial tests, which will be a
subject of future experiments.

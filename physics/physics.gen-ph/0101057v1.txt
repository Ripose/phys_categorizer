Abstract

A recent extended particle model is discussed, which lead to some
interesting consequences in cosmology, neutrino astrophysics and low
dimensional and low temperature statistics, some of which have since
been veriﬁed.

1 The Model

Recent studies go beyond the spacetime points and point particle descrip-
tion of usual Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory. These include
String Theory[1, 2, 3], El Naschie’s theory of Cantorian spacetime and trans-
ﬁnite heterotic String Theory [4, 5] and the author’s theory of stochastic
quantized spacetime [6, 7].
The starting point of this model was the fact that the purely classical Kerr-
Newman Black Hole describes the electron’s ﬁeld including the purely Quan-
tum Mechanical g = 2 factor. However there are two inexplicable features.
The ﬁrst is the naked singularity of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole, if it is
to represent an electron. The second is the complex coordinate shift used
by Newman in deducing the Kerr-Newman metric, which Newman himself

could not explain. It was pointed out[8, 9, 10] that there is a spacetime cut
oﬀ, at the Compton scale (l, τ ) exactly as in the case of Dirac’s non Her-
mitian position operator for the electron. From the Uncertainity Principle
itself it follows that spacetime points are meaningless as they imply inﬁnite
momenta and energy. Rather spacetime intervals are meaningful. Infact the
zitterbewegung is symptomatic of the breakdown of physics within this scale.
It is this spacetime cut oﬀ that fudges the naked singularity and infact averts
what Wheeler has described as the greatest crisis of physics.
Indeed Newman’s complex coordinate shift can be seen to represent the
spacetime cut oﬀ: For if

We can see from (1) that as a result of the complex shift the plane wave is
truncated, by the constraint

the relation (2) can be seen to be the momentum distance Uncertainity re-
lation, as noted above.
We will now review some of the consequences of this formulation, and point
out tht many of these have since been experimentally or observationally con-
ﬁrmed.

2 Consequences

1. Cosmological Considerations
If we use the fact that there would be a ﬂuctuational creation of √N particles
within the minimum Compton cut oﬀ time τ , where N is the total number
of particles, typically pions, in the universe at a given epoch, we deduce the
following relations [11, 12, 13]

where T is the age of the universe. Equation (3) is known empirically, and
has been described by Weinberg to be mysterious. Here it follows as a con-
sequence. Equations (4) and (5) show that the universe would continue to
expand for ever (infact in this case, with decreasing density) and possibly
also accelerate. This was subsequently conﬁrmed by the observations of dis-
tant supernova[14].
It must be mentioned that till these recent observations were made, it was
believed that the expansion of the universe would be subsequently reversed.
It may also be mentioned that the above model does not need to invoke dark
matter which in any case has not been detected. The relation (6) shows
that the universal constant of gravitation varies with time, as in a few other
cosmological models. This is as yet an undecided matter.
2. Anomalous Statistics
Following these arguments it was shown that the divide between Fermi-Dirac
statistics and Bose-Einstein statistics is not so water tight[15, 16, 12, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21].
This fact has lead to some interesting results. One was that the Neutrino
would have a mass given by [22, 23].

and infact there would be a ”weak” electric charge given by

∼
Subsequently the superkamiokande experiments showed exactly such a neu-
trino mass as given in (7)[24].
Yet another interesting result was the super conductivity type of behaviour
of electrons in low dimensions, in particular one and two dimensions. These
would be idealizations of thin wires and thin ﬁlms. It was shown[15] that

in a thin wire which can be approximated as a one dimensional object, the
electrons would behave as if they were below the Fermi temperature, what-
ever be the temperature. It is interesting that recent observations with nano
tubes do indeed conﬁrm such features[25, 26, 27].
Further it was shown that[17, 20, 21] an approximately mono energetic col-
lection of Fermions would show bosonization eﬀects and vice versa, including
a Bose-Einstein type of condensation a little above absolute zero. These need
to be examined experimentally.
3. Quarks and Monopoles
It was shown that electromagnetism was the result of the double connectivity
of the spin half electron, brought out by the fact that well outside the Comp-
ton wavelength it is the positive energy solutions which are invariant under
reﬂection that predominate [8, 9]. From these considerations it was possible
to deduce the well known gravitational force - electromagnetism ratio

Gm2/e2

∼

(9)

However, it was argued that as we approach the Compton wavelength the
double connectivity or three dimensionaity of space breaks down as we begin
to encounter predominantly the negative energy components of the Dirac bi
spinor (with opposite parity), and this was shown to explain the fractional
charges of the quarks, and also provide an order of magnitude estimate
for their masses as also their handedness[28, 29]. This would also explain
why free quarks are never seen in nature. A similar explanation holds for
monopoles [30, 31] (Cf. Appendix).
It is interesting that from the above considerations, using relations like (8)
and (9), we get the well known ratio of all interactions[32]

em : g2

wk : g2

grav ∼

1 : 10−3 : 10−15 : 10−40

APPENDIX

In [8, 9] it was argued that one could get a reconciliation between Quantum
Mechanics, Electromagnetism and Gravitation, from the following consider-
ation:
We use the well known fact that the Dirac four spinor which describes the
electron has the negative energy spinors χ and the positive energy spinors θ
and that as we approach the Compton wavelength, it is the negative energy

4

spinors which dominate, and further under reﬂections, χ behaves like the
pseudo spinor,

It was pointed out that this leads to a coviariant derivative,

(and N = 1 is the weight of χ which shows up as a densiity).
We would like to point out that this is exactly the circumstance for the Dirac
monopole.
What this means is that it is the region at or within the Compton wavelength
where the negative energy spinors predominate that shows up as a monopole.
We can verify the above conclusion from a slighly diﬀerent point of view.
Using the fact that as pointed out by Dirac the Compton wavelength above
is a region that is minimal in the sense that within it we have the unphysical
Zitterbewegung eﬀects which have to be averaged out, we are lead to a non
commutative geometry[7]

and similar relations. For a non commutative structure we have a strong
magnetic ﬁeld B, which in case of (12) is given by

It will be immediately observed that (13) deﬁnes the Dirac monopole.
Interestingly the monopole given by (13) gives an explanation for the dis-
creteness of the charge, as is well known which conclusion also follows from
the fact that in equation (11) above the weight N = 1.

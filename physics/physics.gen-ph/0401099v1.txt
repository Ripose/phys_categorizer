Diﬀerent approaches are presented to investigate diﬀusion from a point source in a slab delimited
by two absorbing boundaries consisting of parallel inﬁnite planes. These approaches enable to
consider the eﬀect of absorption at the boundaries as well as the possibility that the particles that
diﬀuse react with the diﬀusive medium.

The problem of steady-state diﬀusion from a source q(~r) is described by a quite simple equation

where K is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient (homogeneous to a surface per unit time). For a point source q(~r)
embedded in inﬁnite space, the solution is also simple, given by

≡

For more complicated geometries of the diﬀusive volume, the solutions lose this simplicity. In some cases, it is helpful
to use approaches diﬀerent from brute-force resolution. We want to illustrate this point for the problem of diﬀusion in
L) = 0.
a slab delimited in the z direction by two absorbing boundaries, located at z =
We present four approaches, giving identical results when the conditions of validity overlap, taking also into account
the possibility that the particles that diﬀuse can also be destroyed by reacting with the diﬀusive medium. The equation
then reads

where the destruction rate Γ(~r) is related to the density n(~r) of the reacting medium, the reaction cross-section σ and
the velocity v of the diﬀusing particle by Γ(~r) = n(~r)σv. The authors ﬁrst encountered this situation when studying
the diﬀusion of cosmic rays emitted from sources in the galactic plane1. The galactic magnetic ﬁeld has a stochastic
component which is responsible for their diﬀusion, but also for their conﬁnement in a volume which corresponds ap-
proximately to the geometry described above. The destruction term corresponds to the nuclear reactions (spallations)
that may occur when these cosmic Rays cross the regions of the galactic disk where the nuclei of interstellar matter
are present. This is why we pay a particular attention to the situation where the sources, the measurement and the
destruction process are localized in the plane z = 0.

II. STEADY-STATE SOLUTION USING FOURIER-BESSEL TRANSFORMS

A. Diﬀusion equation

Given the geometry of the diﬀusion volume and the source, it is easier to use cylindrical coordinates. In all the

The integration constant ˜N0(k) is ﬁxed by examining the solution in the plane z = 0. The derivatives of the solution
(14) for z = 0 are deﬁned only in terms of distributions. The computation may be made easier using the identity

in the hyperbolic functions, as the derivative of the Heaviside distribution Θ(z) is the Dirac distribution δ(z). This

The diﬀusion process acts as a ﬁltering in the Bessel space, the diﬀused density being related to the source by the

It is a low-pass ﬁlter. Diﬀusion tends to erase the small scale features. The solution in the disk (z = 0) can also be
written under a form making apparent the correction to the free diﬀusion case (2)

When f (

the integrand makes the numerical computation of I[f ] quite tricky. A few examples of manipulations which help to
improve the numerical implementation of Eq. (21) are given in the appendix.

L, Γ = 0) and of r/rd for the case without boundary (thin curve: L → ∞, ﬁnite Γ).

D. Solution for a short-lived species

The same equation (3) is also relevant to study the diﬀusion of unstable particles, with a lifetime τ . The destruction
rate is then homogeneous inside the diﬀusive volume, and given by Γu = 1/τ . It is straightforward to show, using the
same procedure as above, that in that case

III. TIME-DEPENDENT SOLUTION

A more precise description of the diﬀusion process may be obtained from the time-dependent diﬀusion equation.
This gives another formulation of the steady-state solution, as a series having better convergence properties. It also
enables to take diﬀerently into account the case of decaying particles.

We seek the solution at t > 0 such that N (r, z, t = 0) = δ3(~r). It is convenient to use the typical length rd = K/Γ
introduced above, or alternately its reciprocal kd, so that Eq. 24 may be written as

The diﬀusion process in the z direction and in the radial direction are independent. As only pure diﬀusion occurs in
the radial direction, the density can be written as

where α must be positive in order to eliminate runaway solutions for g. The equation on f can be solved for z > 0

close to the free case, as very few particles had time to reach the boundary. At later times, the eﬀect of absorption are more
pronounced.

C. Reformulation of the steady-state model

The stationary regime results from the continuous superposition of solutions for instantaneous sources, so that the

corresponding solution is given by

This expression provides an alternative (but is exactly equivalent) to the usual Fourier Bessel expansion, using the J0
functions. It is particularly well suited for sources well localized in space, like point-like sources, because the functions
over which the development is performed (the K0) do not oscillate. As a consequence, convergence of the series above
is fast and the expression above provides a powerful alternative to compute the density for not too small values of
r/L, as illustrated in Fig. (4) for the case Γ = 0, for which sin2 knL = 1 and cn = L, so that

This case is illustrated in Fig. (4).

IV. METHOD OF IMAGES

A. Deﬁnition and result

In the absence of destruction in the disk, a completely diﬀerent approach is provided by the elegant method of the
images inspired from electrostatics. In inﬁnite space, the solution to our diﬀusion problem is straightforward and is
given by the relation (2) in the case of an initial Dirac distribution at the source S. We furthermore would like to
impose the boundary condition according to which the cosmic-ray density N vanishes on the plane z = +L at any
time. To do so, we can introduce the virtual source S′ that is the image of the real source S with respect to the
boundary z = +L acting like a anti-mirror. The cosmic-ray densities which S and its image S′ generate are equal up
to a relative minus sign that allows both contributions to cancel out exactly on the boundary. In order to impose that
L, we can consider the anti-image S′′ of S with respect to that lower boundary.
the density also vanishes at z =
Because two anti-mirrors are now present at z = +L and z =

They are aligned with the real source S0 ≡

large distances (r ≫ L) and in the case of a small number of sources, these are felt as a single source (positive or negative,
depending on the parity of N ), so that the density tends to plus or minus the free diﬀusion case.

The expression (21) can be easily transformed into (48), for z = 0 in the case Γ = 0. Indeed, in the expression

V. RANDOM WALK APPROACH

It is well known that diﬀusion is closely related to random walks. The density at each point is related to the number
of stochastic path which reach this point, from the source. When a boundary is present at z =
L, the paths that
would go beyond this boundary do not contribute anymore to the density and must be discarded. When destruction
can occur in the disk, the paths that cross the disk should be attributed a lower weight. In this section, we investigate
separately these two eﬀects.

A. Probability of not escaping

We ﬁrst compute the probability that a particle emitted at time t = 0 in the disk has not reached the boundary at
a further time t. At this time, position z is given by a random walk of duration t. The probability we seek is given by

where max and min are the maximum and minimum z reached by the random walk. From elementary statistics,

B. Probability of not escaping for particles reaching the disk

The problem we addressed in the previous sections was a bit diﬀerent, though, as we were interested in particles
reaching a given point, for example in the disk. The same reasoning as before can be used, and the probability that
a particle reaching the disk at time t has not wandered farther than the boundaries is given by

FIG. 8: For each path such that max ≥ L and min ≤ −L, there is a symmetric path satisfying z(t) ≥ 3L.

FIG. 9: If a path such that z(t) = 0 wanders beyond the upper boundary, then there is a symmetric path that satisﬁes z(t) = 2L.
The probability that the path goes beyond this boundary is thus given by the ratio rapport P {z(t) = 2L} /P {z(t) = 0}.

C. The eﬀect of destruction in the disk

We now investigate the eﬀect of destruction occurring in the disk, in the simple case where no boundary is present.
As before, the steady-state 3-D solution will be obtained from the one-dimensional time-dependent diﬀusion. We
N
denote p the probability that a particle crossing the disk is destroyed. In the case of a random walk z =
i=1 zi
consisting of N
t/τ elementary steps of length λ and duration τ , the probability distribution of disk-crossing
numbers n is given by (Papoulis 2002)

This equation has the same form as (82), and relates the microscopic and macroscopic properties of diﬀusion, as p/r0
must be equal to Γ/πK. It should also be remarked that this integral is easier to compute than those involving J0
functions, having a faster convergence as the integrand does not oscillate.

VI. DISCUSSION

The four methods presented in this paper do not all apply in every situation. The ﬁrst two are valid for arbitrary L
and Γ as well as with spontaneous decay of unstable species. The second one contains a richer physical information, as
it provides the density as a function of time. The third one is only valid when Γ = 0, taking only into account the eﬀect
of absorption by the boundaries. The fourth one is more general as we have also presented the case Γ
= 0. However,
it needs to be worked further out in order to consider simultaneously absorption at the boundaries and destruction
in the central plane3. Comparison of the method of images and the use of random walk give some complementary
insights to the consequences of absorption at a boundary. The paths that wander beyond the boundaries, and that
we had to suppress by hand in Sec. V are actually those connecting the point at which the density is sought, to the
negative images introduced in Sec. IV. The eﬀect of these negative images is to destroy the paths that would wander
out of the diﬀusive volume. It is important to note that this is diﬀerent from the path integral interpretation of the
Schrodinger equation, in which case the paths are weighted by a complex phase term, whereas in the classical diﬀusion
case we have discussed, the paths have only

1 factors.

c. Comparison to a known function Part of the diﬃculty to evaluate numerically the Bessel expansions comes
from the fact that the original functions are singular at the source position. As a result, the large k modes continue
to be important to reconstruct the solution. We can take advantage of the fact that the singularity is known, as the
density is quite close to the free diﬀusion case fref (r) = 1/4πKr for small r. The corresponding Bessel coeﬃcients are
given by

˜fref(k) =

In the
where the singularity is entirely contained in the ﬁrst term: the Bessel expansion has been regularized.
remaining integral to be computed, the convergence is much faster, as the large k modes contribute very little. Other
choices of fref(r) may be preferred for particular values of L, Γ and r. This method yields a very good and rapid
convergence for sources located in the thin disk z = 0.

d. Softening of the source term Finally, the source term may be spread out on a radius a, by replacing the point
r)/(πa2) for which an extra 2J1(ka)/ka term appears in the Bessel transform.
a, but convergence is

source δ(~r) by a disk source q(r) = θ(a
With a judicious choice of the parameter a, the solution is very close to the original for r
much faster due to the extra 1/k factor.

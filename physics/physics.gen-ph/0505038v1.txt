Comment on “Torque or no torque? Simple charged particle motion
observed in diﬀerent inertial frames,” by J. D. Jackson [Am.
J. Phys. 72 (12), 1484-1487 (2004)]

In this paper it is shown that the real cause of the apparent electrodynamic
paradox discussed by Jackson [J. D. Jackson, Am. J. Phys. 72, 1484 (2004)]
is the use of three-dimensional (3D) quantities E, B, F, L, N, ..
. When
4D geometric quantities are used then there is no paradox and the principle of
relativity is naturally satisﬁed.

In a recent paper in this Journal Jackson1 discussed the apparent paradox
of diﬀerent mechanical equations for force and torque governing the motion
of a charged particle in diﬀerent inertial frames. Two inertial frames S (the
laboratory frame) and S′ (the moving frame) are considered (they are K and
K ′ respectively in Jackson’s notation). In S′ a particle of charge q and mass m
experiences only the radially directed electric force caused by a point charge Q
ﬁxed permanently at the origin. Consequently both L′ and the torque N′ are
zero in S′, see Fig. 1(a) in Ref. 1. (The vectors in the three-dimensional (3D)
space will be designated in bold-face.) In S the charge Q is in uniform motion
and it produces both an electric ﬁeld E and a magnetic ﬁeld B. The existence
of B in S is responsible for the existence of the 3D magnetic force F = qV × B
and this force provides a 3D torque N (N = x × F) on the charged particle, see
Fig. 1(b) in Ref. 1. Consequently a nonvanishing angular momentum of the
charged particle changes in time in S, N = dL/dt. Here we repeat Jackson’s
words1 about such result: “How can there be a torque and so a time rate of
change of angular momentum in one inertial frame, but no angular momentum
and no torque in another? Is there a paradox? Some experienced readers will
see that there is no paradox - that is just the way things are, ...” (my emphasis)
Such reasoning is considered to be correct by many physicists. However in the
considered case the principle of relativity is violated and the “explanation” of
the type “that is just the way things are” does not remove the violation of the
principle of relativity.

In this Comment it will be shown that - it is not the way things are, but that
there is a simple solution of the above problem which is in a complete accordance
with the principle of relativity. The real cause of the paradox is - the use of
3D quantities, e.g., E, B, F, L, N, their transformations and equations with
them.
Instead of using 3D quantities we shall deal from the outset with 4D
geometric quantities and equations with them. In such treatment the paradox
does not appear and the principle of relativity is naturally satisﬁed. The whole
consideration is presented in much more details in Ref. 2 in which the resolution
of the paradox is exposed in four diﬀerent ways, whereas for this Comment we
choose only one of them. There (Ref. 2) we have also discussed the Trouton-
Noble experiment in which exactly the same paradox appears. It was shown2
that the approach with 4D geometric quantities is in a complete agreement with
experiment.

1

This investigation will be done in the geometric algebra formalism, which is
recently nicely presented in this Journal by Hestenes.3 Physical quantities will
be represented by geometric 4D quantities, multivectors that are deﬁned without
reference frames, i.e., as absolute quantities (AQs) or, when some basis has been
introduced, they are represented as 4D coordinate-based geometric quantities
(CBGQs) comprising both components and a basis. For simplicity and for
easier understanding only the standard basis {γµ; 0, 1, 2, 3} of orthonormal 1-
vectors, with timelike vector γ0 in the forward light cone, will be used. For
all mathematical details regarding the spacetime algebra reader can consult
Hestenes’ paper.3

Let us start the resolution of the paradox discussed by Jackson1 writing
all quantities as 4D AQs. The equations with them will be manifestly Lorentz
invariant equations. Thus the position 1-vector in the 4D spacetime is x. Then
x = x(τ ) determines the history of a particle with proper time τ and proper
velocity u = dx/dτ . The Lorentz force as a 4D AQ (1-vector) is KL = (q/c)F ·u,
where u is the velocity 1-vector of a charge q (it is deﬁned to be the tangent to
its world line).

The bivector ﬁeld F (x) (i.e., the electromagnetic ﬁeld F (x)) for a charge Q

with constant velocity uQ (1-vector) is

3
F (x) = kQ(x ∧ (uQ/c))/ |x ∧ (uQ/c)|

,

(1)

where k = 1/4πε0, see Ref. 2 and my references therein. (For the charge Q at
rest, uQ/c = γ0.) All AQs in Eq. (1) can be written as CBGQs in some basis.
We shall write them in the standard basis {γµ}. In the {γµ} basis x = xµγµ,
uQ = uµ
Qγµ, F = (1/2)F αβγα ∧ γβ; the basis components F αβ are determined
as F αβ = γβ · (γα · F ) = (γβ ∧ γα) · F . In Hestenes’ paper3 the spacetime split
is used for the decomposition of F into the electric and magnetic ﬁelds that
are represented by bivectors, see Eqs. (58)-(60) in Ref. 3. This means that
Hestenes’ decomposition is an observer dependent decomposition; an observer
independent quantity F is decomposed into observer dependent bivectors of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

Instead of using the observer dependent decomposition from Ref. 3 we shall
make an analogy with the tensor formalism4 and represent the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds by 1-vectors E and B that are deﬁned without reference frames,
i.e., as AQs. Thence they are independent of the chosen reference frame and of
the chosen system of coordinates in it.

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v,
E = (1/c)F · v, B = −(1/c2)I(F ∧ v),

(2)

where I is the unit pseudoscalar. (I is deﬁned algebraically without introducing
any reference frame, as in Ref. 5, Sec. 1.2.) The velocity v and all other
quantities entering into the relations (2) are AQs. That velocity v characterizes
some general observer. We can say, as in tensor formalism,4 that v is the velocity
(1-vector) of a family of observers who measures E and B ﬁelds. Of course the

2

(2) hold for any observer; they are manifestly
relations for E and B, Eq.
Lorentz invariant equations. Note that E · v = B · v = 0, which yields that only
three components of E and three components of B are independent quantities.
The 1-vectors E and B for a charge Q moving with constant velocity uQ can
be determined from (2) and the expression for the bivector ﬁeld F (1). They
are

2

E = (D/c
B = (−D/c3)I(x ∧ uQ ∧ v),

)[(uQ · v)x − (x · v)uQ]

(3)

3
where D = kQ/ |x ∧ (uQ/c)|
. When the world lines of the observer and the
charge Q coincide, uQ = v, then (3) yields that B = 0 and only an electric ﬁeld
(Coulomb ﬁeld) remains.

The Lorentz force as a 4D AQ KL = (q/c)F · u can be written in terms of

4D AQs 1-vectors E and B as

KL = (q/c) [(1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v] · u.

(4)

The equivalent expression in the tensor formalism, with tensors as AQs, is re-
cently given in this Journal, Ref. 4. Particularly from the deﬁnition of the
Lorentz force KL and the relation E = (1/c)F · v (from (2)) it follows that the
Lorentz force ascribed by an observer comoving with a charge, u = v, is purely
electric KL = qE. When KL is written as a CBGQ in S and in the {γµ} basis
it is given as

KL = (q/c

2

)[(vν uν)Eµ + eεµ

νρuνcBρ − (Eν uν)vµ]γµ,

(5)

where eεµνρ ≡ ελµνρvλ is the totally skew-symmetric Levi-Civita pseudotensor
induced on the hypersurface orthogonal to v.

Further the angular momentum M (bivector), the torque N (bivector) for
the Lorentz force KL and manifestly Lorentz invariant equation connecting M
and N are deﬁned as

M = x ∧ p, p = mu,
N = x ∧ KL; N = dM/dτ.

When M and N are written as CBGQs in the {γµ} basis they become

M = (1/2)M µνγµ ∧ γν, M µν = m(xµuν − xν uµ),
N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν, N µν = xµK ν

L − xνK µ
L.

We see that the components M µν from (7) are identical to the covariant angular
momentum four-tensor given by Eq. (A3) in Jackson’s paper.1 However M and
N from (6) are 4D geometric quantities, the 4D AQs, which are independent
of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it,
whereas the components M µν and N µν that are used in the usual covariant
(A3) in Ref. 1, are coordinate quantities, the numbers
approach, e.g., Eq.

obtained in the speciﬁc system of coordinates, i.e., in the {γµ} basis. Notice
that, in contrast to the usual covariant approach, M and N from (7) are also
4D geometric quantities, the 4D CBGQs, which contain both components and
a basis, here bivector basis γµ ∧ γν.

Let us now assume that the laboratory frame S is the γ0-system. Thus
in S the observers who measure the ﬁelds are at rest, i.e., v = vµγµ = cγ0,
vµ = (c, 0, 0, 0). Then from (2) it follows that in S the temporal components
of the 4D E and B are zero and only their spatial components remain. In the
laboratory frame S both charges Q and q are moving and the components in
the CBGQs uµ
Q = uµ = (γc, γβc, 0, 0). The ﬁelds E
and B as AQs are given by (3) and when they are written as CBGQs in S then
the components Eµ become E0 = E3 = 0, E1 = Dγ(x1 − βx0), E2 = Dγx2.
Taking into account that in S′ t′ = 0, i.e., x′0 = γ(x0 − βx1) = 0, the relation
x0 = βx1 is obtained. Inserting this last relations into expressions for Eµ we
ﬁnd

Qγµ and uµγµ are given as uµ

E0 = E3 = 0, E1 = Dx1/γ, E2 = Dγx2.

The charge Q moves in the S frame, which yields that the magnetic ﬁeld B =
Bµγµ is now diﬀerent from zero. The components Bµ are

B0 = B1 = B2 = 0, B3 = (1/c)Dγβx2 = βE2/c.

The spatial components Ei and Bi from (8) and (9) are the same as the usual
expressions for the components of the 3D vectors E and B. Inserting (8) and
(9) into (5) we ﬁnd the expression for the Lorentz force KL in the laboratory
frame S. The components of KL in S are

We see that in S, when it is the γ0-system in which the observers who measure
the ﬁelds are at rest, v = cγ0, there is the 4D magnetic ﬁeld (9) which enters
into the expression for the total 4D Lorentz force KL. Then using (8), (9), (10)
and the relation x0 = βx1 one easily ﬁnds that all components N µν are zero

L ⇒ N 01 = x1(βK 1

L = qDx2 ⇒ N 02 = N 12 = 0.

Thus although in S there is the 4D magnetic ﬁeld (9) and there is a part of
KL (in K 2
L in (10)), which corresponds to the magnetic force, it is obtained
that all components N µν are zero, N µν = 0, and consequently the whole torque
N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν = 0. Every 4D CBGQ is invariant upon the passive
Lorentz transformations; the components transform by the Lorentz transforma-
tions and the basis by the inverse Lorentz transformations leaving the whole
CBGQ unchanged. The invariance of some 4D CBGQ upon the passive Lorentz
transformations reﬂects the fact that such mathematical, invariant, geometric

4D quantity represents the same physical object for relatively moving observers.
Due to the invariance of any 4D CBGQ upon the passive Lorentz transforma-
tions N will be zero in all other relatively moving inertial frames, thus in S′, as

The paradox does not appear since the principle of relativity is automatically
satisﬁed in such an approach to special relativity which exclusively deals with 4D
geometric quantities, i.e., AQs or CBGQs, whereas in the standard approach to
special relativity6 the principle of relativity is postulated outside the framework
of a mathematical formulation of the theory.

The conclusion that can be drawn from this proof that N is zero in all
relatively moving inertial frames is that the real cause of the violation of the
principle of relativity and of the existence of the paradox is the use of 3D
quantities as physical quantities in the 4D spacetime.

In the geometric approach to special relativity the independent physical real-
ity, both theoretically and experimentally, is attributed only to the 4D geometric
quantities, AQs or CBGQs, and not, as usual, to the 3D quantities. In Ref.
1 even the covariant quantities, e.g., M µν, xµ, uν, F αβ, etc. are considered
as auxiliary mathematical quantities from which “physical” 3D quantities are
deduced.

It is worth noting that the comparison7 with well-known experiments that
test special relativity as are the Michelson-Morley experiment, the ”muon” ex-
periments, the Kennedy-Thorndike type experiments and the Ives-Stilwell type
experiments explicitly shows that all these experiments are in a complete agree-
ment with such an approach with 4D geometric quantities, whereas, contrary
to the general belief, it is not the case for the usual approach that deals with,
e.g., the Lorentz contraction and the dilatation of time; the spatial distances
and temporal distances taken separately are not well-deﬁned quantities in the
4D spacetime.

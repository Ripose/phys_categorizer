On Some Physical Aspects of Planck-Scale
Relativity:A Simpliﬁed Approach

Alex Granik∗

Abstract

The kinematics of the two-scale relativity theory (new relativity)
is revisited using a simpliﬁed approach. This approach allows us not
only to derive the dispersion equation introduced earlier by Kowalski-
Glikman, but to ﬁnd an additional dispersion relation, and, even more
important, to provide a physical basis for such relations. They are ex-
plained by the fact that in the observer invariant two-scale relativity
( new relativity) the Planck constant does nor remain constant any-
more, but depends on the universal length scale. This leads to the
correct relation between energy and frequency at any scale.

1 Introduction

∼

1.6

The pioneering papers By G.Amelino-Camelia [1],[2] have explicitly and un-
ambiguously introduced what can be called a ”two-scale special relativity”
(or a new relativity). The crucial feature of this new relativity is the intro-
duction of an observer-independent absolute scale (possibly the Planck scale
10−35m) in addition to the existing in special relativity observer-
Λ
independent universal velocity scale, the speed of light. The investigation of
a structure of the emerging space-time at the Planck scale ( diﬀerent from
Minkowski space-time) is based upon κ-Poincare algebra ([3] and references
therein). It should be mentioned that consequences of the ﬁnite universal
length scale on the resulting mechanics have also been studied by L.Nottale,
C.Castro, and others researchers (e.g., [4], [5], and references therein),albeit

from a diﬀerent point of view.

J.Kowalski-Glikman [6] investigated the space-time transformations and found
that the metric structure of the respective space-time events has the Minkowski
distance as an invariant. He also proposed the dispersion relation which re-
moves a seemingly paradoxical discrepancy between the inﬁnite group ve-
locity of a wave and the ﬁnite velocity of a massless particle. However the
author emphasized that this relation is required a justiﬁcation ”by more solid
arguments”.

We have to emphasize that here we are not going to dwell on group-theoretical
properties of the respective space, but rather try via a simplify approach to
revisit some physical points of the problem.

In view of this, we provide a simpliﬁed derivation of the dispersion relation
and show that there is an additional dispersion relation, consistent with the
ﬁnite velocity of a massless particle. We also provide an explanation of the
physical reason behind these relations.
The ﬁrst of these relations corresponds to the boost transformation of posi-
tion and time carried out in the space of the boost parameter ξ, independent
of the universal invariant length scale λ.
In this case the transformation
does not coincide with the special relativistic transformation, and neither p0
(energy) is proportional to the frequency nor the momentum pα, α = 1, 2, 3.
is proportional to the wave number.
On the other hand, the second transformation carried out in the space of
the boost parameter z which is a function of the length-scale-independent
boost parameter ξ and the invariant length scale itself.
In this space the
transformation coincides with the special-relativistic boost, the momentum
is proportional to the wave number, but energy is not proportional to the
frequency, requiring a certain modiﬁcation of the relation between them.
The explanation of this situation ( and equally of the situation with the
previous case) can be as follows. Since in quantum mechanics energy is given
by ¯h
f requency, and now frequency is not proportional to energy, this
means that the introduction of the additional invariant parameter ( invariant
length scale λ) into a description of mechanics results in other parameters (
including ¯h) becoming functions of lambda. This leads to the emergence of
the so-called ef f ective Planck constant(e.g. ref[5]) and the accompanying
restoration of the proportionality between energy and frequency.

In addition, by examining the metric structure of the space-time with the
help of simple arguments we explicitly ﬁnd the boundaries of time-like/space-
like intervals. It has turned out that these boundaries indicate two mutually
exclusive possibilities:

1)physical. Massive particles cannot reach the speed of light, in a world
with two independent universal observer-independent scales,
2)hypothetical.Massive particles can move with velocities reaching the
speed of light, but two universal scales of the theory are not independent.

Finally, we provide the composition law for velocities of two particles having
the same mass.

Following the lead provided by the one-scale special relativity (e.g., [8]) we
begin our analysis by considering the Minkowski distance (written in the dif-
ferential form) , invariant under the boost transformations of the κ-Poincare
algebra [6]:

two scales, speed of light and λ, are not independent, hinting at the existence
of only one observer-invariant scale, length scale λ.

Since expression (9) for pα as a function of Vα formally looks exactly like its
special relativistic counterpart, this gives us a clue for undertaking the task
of casting the appropriate equations into the form found in special relativity.
We begin with the relation between energy p0

[7] :

p0 =

log[ ¯m coshξ +

(13)

and the momentum pα given by Eq.(10).

−

sinh2ξ

Since the basic relations in special relativity revolve around the identity
cosh2ξ
1 (yielding in particular the relation E2 = p2 + m2) ,
it is clear that to reach our goal we have to express cosh and sinh in terms
of p0 and pα using (10) and (13). For convenience sake, in the following I
will drop the subscript at pα. Comparing (10) and (13), we immediately ﬁnd
that

On the other hand, from (13) we obtain

sinhξ =

Now it is very easy to recognize what we call the eﬀective frequency ¯ω and
the ef f ective wave number ¯k:

(17)

¯k = pep0λ

¯ω =

λ

According to (14) and (15), the relation between them is the exact copy of
the respective relation in special relativity:

¯ω2 = ¯k2 + ¯m2

(18)

Thus we have arrived at the dispersion relation by identifying the frequency
not with the energy part p0 of the four-momentum but with a certain func-
¯omega,
tion (to be found) of energy and momentum, which we denote by
and using the same procedure for the momentum part p ( by identifying the
wave number with the a certain function ¯k).

The physical justiﬁcation of this is as follows. On the scales much exceeding
λ the Planck constant is not aﬀected by the existence of the universal length
scale. However, at the scales comparable with λ this is not true anymore, and
as a result the Planck ”constant” becomes the ef f ective Planck function ¯hef f
which varies with λ, momentum p, and energy p0 (e.g., reference [5]). In the
¯h. Thus despite the fact that now frequency is a
limit of λ
function of p, p0, and λ the overall linear relation between energy p0 and
frequency is preserved. This means that since ω = p0 (in the units where the
Planck constant ¯h = 1:

¯hef f →

energy = hef f ¯ω = p0

(19)

We investigate this relation in more detail in the next section.

It is seen that now the group velocity vg

For a massless particle both the group velocity and phase velocity reach
the speed of light, in full agreement with the expression for Vα (12). The
well-known theorem of the conventional relativity stating that

holds true.

eﬀective frequency ¯ω is given in terms of p0 and λm, Eq.(17). In view of the
basic relation (3) between m, p, and p0 we can derive the relation between
1 + ( ¯mλ)2
the ¯ω , Eq.(17) and p0 by inserting the value of cosh(mλ)
≡ q
from (3) into (16). This would immediately give us the following

The derived relations (16) and (20) are the relations introduced in [6] with-
out a proof. Moreover, we have provided a physical justiﬁcation for these
relations.

Now we will recast the expressions for the spatial part of 4- velocity (12)
into the form similar to special relativity. Recalling that in special relativity
sinhξ corresponds to the spatial part u of the four-velocity, equation (14)
can be written in terms of the reduced four-velocity u:

¯p
¯m

= sinhξ = ¯u

We express ¯u in terms of V with the help of (12), use the deﬁnition of the
”speed of light” cλ, and denote peλp0 = ¯p. As a result, we get

From (25) follows that if either V1 or V2 ( or both) go to cλ the combined
velocity also tends to cλ as could be expected.

II. Here we investigate another approach to the problem of the dispersion
equation , based on working directly in the space of the boost parameter
z(ξ, λ) which depends on both the ”bare” boost parameter ξ and the universal
length scale λ. We return to the Minkowski distance and write down the
respective spatio-temporal transformation from one inertial system K to a
system K ′ moving with respect to K with a constant velocity V.
We require (in full agreement with the invariance of Minkowski distance)
this transformation to be exactly similar to the special relativistic relations
(cf.[6]):

where the boost parameter z(ξ, λ) has to be determined.
To ﬁnd parameter z(ξ, λ) we use the fact that the velocity of K ′ with respect
to K is

V = tanhz,

as follows from (26). Introducing this expression for V into (12) we obtain

tanhz(ξ) =

with the only diﬀerence that in [6] was a typographical error showing an ad-

In view of this it is clear that deﬁning energy as p0 [Eq.(13)] is not going
to give us the relation between p and p0 consistent with the V (m = 0) = 1.
The analogous case was considered above, but there we dealt with the trans-
formation space deﬁned directly by the parameter ξ and not yielding the
transformation in the form (26). The problem there has been solved by the
introduction of both ef f ective wave number and ef f ective frequency.

Here however we look for another transformation which will keep the wave
number as p ( in the appropriate units), but transform p0 in such a way as
to produce the required ef f ective frequency. To this end we require such
a eﬀective frequency ¯ω to behave like the temporal component ( vs. spatial
component p = ¯k) of the 4-vector of coordinates deﬁned by (26)

¯ω2 = ¯m2 + ¯k2

(28)

Note that in this case ( as we have already indicated), as in the previous case
the eﬀective mass ¯m, is the same. On the other hand, the ef f ective wave
number (¯k = p) and the eﬀective frequency are diﬀerent as compared to case
I.
Since ¯k = p we have to ﬁnd the explicit expression for the frequency ¯ω. Using
the expression for p, Eq.(10) we get

¯ω
¯m

=

cosh(mλ)coshξ + sinh(mλ)
sinh(mλ)coshξ + cosh(mλ)

By combining Eq.(29)with the formula for p0, Eq.(13), we obtain

Upon substitution of cosh(mλ) from Eq.(3) we get the dependence of ω on

p2e−p0λ

In contradistinction to case I, the eﬀective frequency ¯ω is ﬁnite when the
momentum p = ¯k

dispersion relation, Eq.(26) or Eq.(31), in the equivalent form:

limit. Here we restrict our attention to the physical case of λ > 0, which will
ensure that 0

III. We are facing the dilemma here which of the dispersion equation to
use. The second choice looks more preferable. This is dictated by the fact
that here only the frequency must undergo a transformation to become the
ef ective frequency, while the wave number is still equal to the momentum
p. Since , as we will see below the ef f ective Planck number ¯hef f must be a
function of the universal length scale λ and the wave number ( read physical
momentum), our choice looks more physical.

3 Uncertainty Relation

Now, when we have derived the dispersion relations (20), (32), we use them
to explicitly ﬁnd the value of the ef f ective Planck number ¯hef f . We restrict
our attention to the relation given by Eq.(32). Inserting the eﬀective Planck
constant , deﬁned according to Eq.(19), into (32) we get

4 Conclusion

We have undertaken a task of deriving and to physically justify by simple
means the consistent ( with the velocity of a massless particle) two-scale
relativity ( new relativity [1]) dispersion relations. It has turned out that in
addition to the one relation introduced in [6] there exists another relation
which is compatible with the velocity of a massless particle to be V (m =
0) = 1.
The dispersion relations resolve an apparent paradox arising from the fact
that if one would take the frequency to be equal to energy and wave number

14

to be equal to the momentum (in the appropriate units), then the basic rela-
tion between energy and momentum cannot be translated into a consistent
dispersion relation. The seemingly puzzling behavior of frequency-energy
and momentum-wave number has a rather straightforward explanation.
At length scales comparable to the universal length scale λ the Planck con-
stant stops to be constant and becomes a function of both the wave number
and the universal length scale. Since we assume that the 2-scale relativ-
ity is based upon the two universal invariants ,thus indicating that at the
scales comparable to λ the quantities considered constant at larger scales,
become dependent on the two invariants and dynamic variables. This re-
stores the linear character of frequency-energy and momentum-wave number
relations.Moreover, such an explanation is in full agreement with the string
theory, where the uncertainty relation clearly indicates a variable character
of the Planck number at scales comparable to λ.
The derived dispersion relations diﬀer by the way how the frequency-energy
and momentum-wave equations are realized. In the one of them ( discov-
ered in [6]) both frequency and momentum translate into the frequency and
wave number in a fashion which is diﬀerent from the conventional special
relativity. In the second one ( found in this paper) only the energy translates
into frequency in an unorthodox way, leaving the momentum-wave number
relation unchanged as compared to the conventional relativity. This is the
reason why the former was chosen as the correct , since otherwise we will
have diﬀerent values for the eﬀective Planck constant.
It is seen from that the two-scale relativity uncertainty relation yields the
divergence of the position spread at the ﬁnite value of the momentum spread,
in contradistinction to strings where this occurs at inﬁnite momentum spread.
There is also another diﬀerence: the stringy relation contains only two terms,
with parameter λ entering in the second power, whereas in two-scale relativity
the uncertainty relation is more complicated, and its expansion in Taylor
series contains all powers of λ.

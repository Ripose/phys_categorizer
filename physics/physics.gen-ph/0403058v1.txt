Abstract. The paper formulates Maxwell’s equations in 4-dimensional Euclidean
space by embedding the electromagnetic vector potential in the frame vector g0.
Relativistic electrodynamics is the ﬁrst problem tackled; in spite of using a geometry
radically diﬀerent from that of special relativity, the paper derives relativistic
electrodynamics from space curvature. Maxwell’s equations are then formulated and
solved for free space providing solutions which rotate the vector potential on a plane;
these solutions are shown equivalent to the usual spacetime formulation and are then
discussed in terms of the hypersphere model of the Universe recently proposed by the
author.

Maxwell’s equations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space

1. Introduction

In recent years I’ve been proposing an extension of optics to 4-dimensional space,
naturally calling this discipline 4-dimensional optics (4DO). Initially this was proposed
as an alternative formulation for relativistic problems; two papers that use this view and
provide a good introduction are Almeida [1, 2]. The latter of these references has some
ﬂaws in its approach to electromagnetism which will be corrected here; it also suggested
a metric for vacuum which was superseded by a more appropriate one in [3]. In this very
recent work I made some cosmological predictions arising from a development of 4DO,
which had so far been impossible with a general relativity approach, showing that dark
matter is really unnecessary for the explanation of observations if one accepts 4-space as
being Euclidean with coordinate x0 the radius of an hypersphere. The latter work left
unexplained the fact that photons were constrained to great circles in a 4-dimensional
hypersphere rather than following straight line geodesics.

The explanation of photon behaviour calls for a full exposition of Maxwell’s
equations in 4DO context, which has not yet been done in a formal way. The
present paper is a presentation of electromagnetism in 4DO space, introducing the
electromagnetic vector potential as part of the space frame and deriving Maxwell’s
The solution of Maxwell’s equations leading to
equations in a natural way.
electromagnetic waves is then shown to be bound to great circles on the 4D hypersphere,
thus solving the diﬃculty in Almeida [3].

In the exposition I will make full use of an extraordinary and little known
mathematical tool called geometric (Cliﬀord) algebra, which received an important
thrust with the works of David Hestenes [4]. A good introduction to geometric algebra
can be found in Gull et al. [5] and in the following paragraphs I will use the notation and
conventions of the latter. Expressing Maxwell’s equations in the formalism of geometric
algebra is not new; the Cambridge Group responsible for the reference above uses this
approach in one of their courses [6] for the relativistic formulation of those equations,
which are then condensed in the extraordinarily compact equation

∇2A = J.

(1)

Although this formulation is valid for Minkowski spacetime, with a diﬀerent signature
from 4DO, I shall follow closely that group’s exposition.

Before embarking into the transposition of electromagnetism to 4DO the paper
makes a brief introduction to geometric algebra and makes a quick revision of 4DO’s
principles, using the opportunity to express them in the former’s formalism.

2. Introduction to geometric algebra

The geometric algebra of Euclidean 4-space G4 is generated by the frame of orthonormal
vectors {σµ}, µ = 0 . . . 3, verifying the relation

(σµσν + σνσµ) = δµν.

σµ·σν =

(2)

Maxwell’s equations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space

The algebra is 16-dimensional and is spanned by the basis

1,

{σµ},

{σµσν},

{σµI},

I,

1 scalar 4 vectors 6 bivectors 4 trivectors 1 fourvector

where I ≡ σ0σ1σ2σ3 is also called the pseudoscalar. The elements of this basis are such
that all vectors and the pseudoscalar square to unity

(σµ)2 = 1,

I 2 = 1;

and all bivectors and trivectors square to −1

(σµσν)2 = −1,

(σµI)2 = −1.

It will be convenient to shorten the product of basis vectors with a multi-index compact
notation; for instance σµσν ≡ σµν.

The geometric product of any two vectors a = aµσµ and b = bνσν can be decomposed
into a symmetric part, a scalar called the inner product, and an anti-symmetric part, a
bivector called the exterior product.

Reversing the deﬁnition one can write internal and exterior products as

ab = a·b + a∧b,

ba = a·b − a∧b.

a·b =

(ab + ba),

a∧b =

(ab − ba).

The exponential of bivectors is especially important and deserves an explanation

here. If u is a bivector or trivector such that u2 = −1 and θ is a scalar

Although less important in the present work, the exponential of vectors and fourvector
can also be deﬁned; if h is a vector or fourvector such that h2 = 1

The exponential of bivectors is useful for deﬁning rotations; a rotation of vector a by
angle θ on the σ12 plane is performed by
a′ = e−σ12θ/2aeσ12θ/2 = Ra ˜R;

Similarly, if we had made a = σ2, the result would have been − sin θσ1 + cos θσ2.

If we use B to represent a bivector and deﬁne its norm by |B| = (B ˜B)1/2, a general

rotation in 4-space is represented by the rotor

R ≡ e−B/2 = cos(|B|/2) −

sin(|B|/2).

B
|B|

The rotation angle is |B| and it is performed on the plane deﬁned by B. A rotor is
deﬁned as a unitary even multivector (a multivector with even grade components only);
we are particularly interested in rotors with scalar and bivector components. It is more
general to deﬁne a rotation by a plane (bivector) then by an axis (vector) because the
latter only works in 3D while the former is applicable in any dimension.

In a general situation the frame may not be orthonormed and we will generally

deﬁne this frame by expressing its vectors in the ﬁducial frame σµ [7]

µ is called the ﬁducial tensor. The metric tensor is then deﬁned by the inner

gµ = hα

µσα;

where hα
products of the frame vectors

gµν = gµ·gν.

gµ·gν = δµ

ν.

Complementary we can then deﬁne the reciprocal frame by the relation

This method for frame and metric deﬁnition is absolutely general and it is signature
preserving. Since our ﬁducial frame has signature (+ + ++) all the frames deﬁned with
reference to it will preserve that signature. Hestenes [7] discusses curvature in geometric
algebra formulation but he uses a Minkowski ﬁducial frame with signature (+ − −−).

3. Moving frames in 4DO

In this section we will be looking at the frame applicable to a moving observer and
making a parallel to Lorentz transformations in special relativity. This is a reformulation
of the presentation in [1] using the formalism of geometric algebra. We must recall that
4DO is characterised by time being evaluated as geodesic arc length in 4-dimensional
space

c2dt2 = gµνdxµdxν.

(16)

From this point onwards we avoid all problems of dimensional homogeneity by
using normalising factors listed in Table 1 for all units, deﬁned with recourse to the

Maxwell’s equations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space

Table 1. Normalising factors for non-dimensional units used in the text

fundamental constants: Planck constant divided by 2π (~), gravitational constant
(G), speed of light (c) and proton charge (e). This normalisation deﬁnes a system
of non-dimensional units with important consequences, namely: 1) All the fundamental
constants, ~, G, c, e, become unity; 2) a particle’s Compton frequency, deﬁned by
ν = mc2/~, becomes equal to the particle’s mass; 3) the frequent term GM /(c2r) is
simpliﬁed to M/r.

In non-dimensional units equation (16) above can be obtained from the equivalent

vector deﬁnition [3]

ds = gµdxµ,

v = gµ ˙xµ,

where ds is the displacement vector and dt2 = ds·ds. Consequently the velocity vector
is deﬁned by

where ”dot” over a variable means time derivative.

As an introductory example to moving observer frames we will suppose an observer
¯O with velocity v = cos θσ0 + sin θσ1, Fig. (1). The moving observer is obviously
stationary in his own frame and so his ¯x0 axis must be aligned with v; hence the
corresponding frame vector must be obtained from v by product with a scalar: g0 = λv.
In 4DO light is characterised by geodesics with dx0 = 0, a necessary condition for the
3-space velocity to have unitary norm. These displacements must be evaluated similarly
by the ﬁxed and moving observers so their three frame vectors corresponding to 3-space
must remain unaltered: gi = σi.

Any coordinate change cannot alter a displacement so that the latter can be equally

expressed in either coordinate system

ds = σµdxµ = gµd¯xµ.

Applying to the case under study

ds = σ0dx0 + σ1dx1 = λ(cos θσ0 + sin θσ1)d¯x0.

As last argument special relativity imposes the invariance of (dx0)2 = dt2−

(dxi)2;
(dxi)2. Consequently, for compatibility

P

in 4DO we have, from Eq. (16), dt2 = (dx0)2 +
with special relativity, we must require also that ‡

P

d¯x0 = dx0.

‡ In Almeida [1] a diﬀerent argument is used to justify this invariance.

velocity; time intervals must be the same in both frames; dx0 and time intervals must
be preserved when the coordinates are transformed; the displacement g0dx0 can be
decomposed into σ0dx0 + σ1d¯x1.

Combining Eqs. (20) and (21) it must be λ = sec θ and

g0 = σ0 + tan θσ1 = σ0(1 + tan θσ01).

The metric tensor components can be evaluated by Eq. (14)

g00 = 1 + tan2 θ,

g01 = g10 = tan θ.

The evaluation of dt2 is unaltered because this is still the ﬁxed observer’s time
measurement performed in the moving observer’s coordinates; we call this a coordinate
change, which is diﬀerent from a metric change. Using Eq. (17) a general displacement
is evaluated in the two frames as

ds = σ0dx0 + σ1dx1 = (σ0 + tan θσ1)dx0 + σ1d¯x1;

and the coordinate conversion is immediate

d¯x1 = dx1 − tan θdx0.

The coordinate transformation for a moving observer seems incompatible with
the corresponding transformation in special relativity, which is described by a Lorentz
transformation and produces time dilation. This incompatibility is only apparent since
the moving observer has no reason to choose a skew frame and evaluates displacements
with a standard orthonormed frame

d¯s = σ0dx0 + σ1(dx1 − tan θdx0) = ds − σ1 tan θdx0.

Notice that the special relativity invariant is preserved in the moving observer’s
evaluation of time

SR = (dt)2 − (dx1)2 = (d¯t)2 − (d¯x1)2 = (dx0)2.

The previous example restrained the analysis to movement along the σ1 direction,
described by a velocity vector with σ0 and σ1 components.
In general a coordinate
change deﬁnes a skew frame whose vectors result from the transformation applied to
the element σ0

where the bold v represents the 3 spatial velocity components or the velocity vector in
the non-relativistic sense. The coordinate conversion preserves dx0 and for the remaining
coordinates we have

The interval evaluated by the moving observer in his orthonormed frame is

d¯xk = dxk −

d¯s = d¯xµσµ = ds −

In conclusion, the 4DO counterpart of a Lorentz transformation in special relativity

is a two-step process.

• A transformation of the spatial coordinates xi, preserving the ﬁxed observer’s
time measurement; the corresponding frame is called the skew frame and the
transformation is called a coordinate change.

• A jump into the orthonormed moving frame with the consequent time dilation.
This is mathematically a metric change because the length of displacements is not
preserved.

A concrete situation where a moving frame had to be considered appeared in
Almeida [3, Eq. (14)], an equation with the same form of Eq. (24), equivalent to a
frame vector

g0 = σ0 +

xkσk
x0 .

In this case the movement has a geometric cause and results from the natural (geometric)
expansion of the Universe when the hypersphere model is assumed.

4. Electrodynamics as space curvature

Relativistic dynamics, for cases of isotropic media, is modeled in 4DO by the frame

g0 = n0σ0,

gj = nrσj,

where n0 and nr are scalar functions of the coordinates called refractive indices.
Application of Eq. (16) with c = 1 leads to the time interval

dt2 = (n0dx0)2 + (nr)2

(dxj)2.

as is fully demonstrated in Almeida [3, Sec. 4]. The equivalence between 4DO and
GR spaces stops when the metric is non-static, meaning that the refractive indices are
functions of x0 in 4DO or t in GR. The two spaces are not equivalent either, for any
displacements which involve parallel transport.

The ﬁrst question we would like to answer in this section is whether a frame of the
type deﬁned by Eqs. (32) is adequate to model the dynamics of a charged particle under
an electric ﬁeld; for this we will use the refractive indices

where q is the charge of the moving particle, m is its mass and V is the electric potential,
including the ﬁne structure constant α. So, for instance, the electric ﬁeld of a stationary
particle with charge Q is

n0 = 1 +

nr = 1,

qV
m

,

V =

αQ
r

.

Notice that the refractive indices are deﬁned for an interaction between two charges,
the same happening with the space metric. The space that we are deﬁning exists only
for the interaction under study and it is not a pre-existing arena where the dynamics is
played.

The frame of Eqs. (35) produces the time deﬁnition

Following the procedure in Almeida [3] we will ﬁnd the geodesic equations by ﬁrst
dividing both members by dt2 and deﬁning a constant Lagrangian L = 1/2

under the electric potential V . Electric potentials typically decrease with 1/r and thus
the parenthesis can be taken as unity for large distances from electric ﬁeld sources; for the
interaction between two electrons, considering the non-dimensional units’ normalising
factors, this condition means distances considerably larger than 2.8 × 10−15 m.

Having shown that dynamics under an electric ﬁeld can be modeled by a suitably
chosen frame, we need to investigate if the same applies when a magnetic ﬁeld is present.
Magnetic ﬁelds are originated by moving charges and we have seen how a moving frame
can be obtained from a stationary one by a transformation applied to its zeroth vector.
Since electric ﬁeld dynamics only implies the consideration of refractive index n0, the
other refractive index nr remaining unity, it is natural to admit that an electromagnetic
interaction could be modeled by the following frame

g0 = σ0 +

gj = σj,

(42)

where A = Aµσµ represents the vector potential; note that the vector potential is referred
to the orthonormed frame σµ and not to the skew frame gµ. The equation above is
equivalent to the deﬁnition of a ﬁducial tensor but the vector potential approach is
more convenient for the derivations that follow.

The metric tensor elements are obtained, as usual, by Eq. (14)

Instead of using the geodesic Lagrangian to ﬁnd its Euler-Lagrange equations, we will
follow a diﬀerent procedure, starting with the velocity vector from Eq. (18) with the
frame vectors from Eqs. (42)

This is used for the derivation of an identity relative to acceleration

v =

We will now deﬁne the vector derivative

∇ = σµ∂µ.

Maxwell’s equations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space

It is now convenient to deﬁne the Faraday bivector F = ∇ ∧ A. F is necessarily a
bivector because it is deﬁned as an exterior product of two vectors; we can separate it
into electric and magnetic components

F = Ejσj0 + Bkiσk.

Ej and Bk are the components of electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors, respectively;
i = σ123 is a special trivector incorporating the 3 spatial frame vectors, so that iσk is
a spatial bivector where the component σk is not present. Using boldface letters to
represent 3-vectors, the Faraday bivector can be rewritten as

F = Eσ0 + iB.

And the acceleration becomes

˙v =

v·(Eσ0 + iB) .

˙x0q
m

5. Maxwell’s equations

This form of the Lorentz acceleration is relativistic because the norm of the velocity
vector will be kept equal to unity at all times.

Using the vector derivative deﬁned in Eq. (45) we write the derivative of Faraday bivector

∇F = ∇·F + ∇∧F,

The internal product in the second member is expanded as

∇·F = ∂kEkσ0 − ∂0Ekσk + (∂3B2 − ∂2B3)σ1

+ (∂1B3 − ∂3B1)σ2 + (∂2B1 − ∂1B2)σ3.

A careful look at the second member shows that the ﬁrst term is the divergence of E
multiplied by σ0. The second term is −∂0E, but we must take into account that in
a stationary frame dt = dx0, so this term can be taken as the negative of the time
derivative in such frame. The last 3 terms represent the 3-dimensional cross product,
for which we will use the symbol ”×”. If the bold symbol ”∇” represents the usual
3-dimensional nabla operator, the equation can be written
∇·F = ∇· Eσ0 + ∇× B − ∂0E.

(55)

Deﬁning the current vector J = ρσ0 + J, for a stationary frame, the ﬁrst two Maxwell’s
equations are expressed by

∇·F = J.

For the remaining two equations we have to look at the exterior product ∇∧F

∇∧F = (∂3E2 − ∂2E3)σ023 + (∂1E3 − ∂3E1)σ031

+ (∂2E1 − ∂1E2)σ012 + i∂kBk + ∂0BkIσk

= i(∇×Eσ0 + ∇·B + ∂0Bσ0).

Maxwell’s equations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space

The remaining two equations are expressed as ∇ ∧F = 0 and the four equations can
then be condensed in the very compact form

Additionally, it is possible to choose A such that ∇·A = 0, so that an equivalent form
of the four equations is

Solutions of special interest are those where the second member is null (J = 0).
Some solutions can be found easily by splitting ∇2A in its 0th and spatial components

∇F = J.

∇2A = J,

(∇·A = 0.)

∇2A = ∂00A + ∇2A,

where the second term is a standard 3D Laplacian. One possible solution arises
immediately when ∂00A = ω2A with ω real;
∇2A = −ω2A,

(63)

results in a well known Helmholtz equation. Looking for a particular solution we assume
only x3 and x0 dependence to ﬁnd

Where u2 = −1 and u must commute with σ3. The two possibilities are either u = i or
u = iσ3; we will choose the latter. Since we know that A is a vector it must be

A = A0e−ωx0−uωx3

.

A0 = ασ1 + βσ2;

an eventual component aligned with σ0 has been ignored.

In order to make interpretation of Eq. (64) easier we shall now write it in a slightly

modiﬁed form

A = e−ωx0

eiσ3ωx3/2(ασ1 + βσ2)e−iσ3ωx3/2.

It is now apparent that the ﬁrst exponential factor is evanescent in the positive x0
direction and grows to inﬁnity in the negative direction; this is an uncomfortable
situation that will be resolved below. The remaining factors represent a vector that
rotates in the iσ3 plane, along the x3 direction, with angular frequency ω. With an
adequate choice for the origin of x3 it is possible to make β = 0.

Before we proceed to the analysis of evanescence along x0 let us consider consider

the expression for A when x0 is constant; setting α′ = α exp(−ωx0) it is

A = α′σ1e−iσ3ωx3

.

A = α′σ1e−iσ3ωt.

Along the direction normal to the rotation plane we can deﬁne time to be equal to the
distance traveled, t = x3 and so A can also be expressed as a time function

In spacetime formulation time is a coordinate and we express the fact that t = x3 by
giving A opposite dependencies in the two variables
A = α′σ1e−iσ3ω(x3−t).

This is the spacetime formulation for a circularly polarised electromagnetic wave [6].

In Almeida [3] the Universe is modeled as an hypersphere whose radius is the
coordinate x0. For displacements that are small compared to the hypersphere radius
it is possible to use length coordinates rather than angles, resulting in the g0 frame
vector of Eq. (31). A comparison between this equation and Eq. (42) shows that the
Universe’s expansion is the source of a vector potential A = xkσk/x0; the derivations
in the previous section show that there are solutions to Maxwell’s equations that force
the vector potential to rotate and the frame vector g0 with it. These solutions force
x0 to stay constant and so they are constrained to hyperspherical surfaces of constant
radius. This solves the unanswered question raised in Almeida [3] whereby photons were
constrained to great circles on the hypersphere, rather than to geodesic straight lines.
We can now turn our attention to the evanescence problem or rather to the problem
of an amplitude growing exponentially in the negative x0 direction. This is the direction
pointing towards the hypersphere centre and suggests that the approximations made
in order to use ﬂat space are the source of the inconsistency. Recalling that in the
hypersphere model the Universe is expanding at the speed of light, we can expect that
there are resonating modes inside the hypersphere, which are evanescent to its outside
due to continuity on the hypersphere border. A correct solution of Maxwell’s equations
should not ignore this fact and will be pursued in forthcoming work. The resonating
modes are so closely spaced with the current size of the Universe that we can actually
consider a continuous distribution, but they manifest themselves as electromagnetic
waves when space is artiﬁcially ﬂattened.

6. Conclusion

The formalism of geometric algebra was used in this paper as useful mathematical
tool for writing complex equations in a compact form and facilitate their geometrical
interpretation. Although most readers will not be familiar with this algebra, we think
that the simpliﬁcations achieved through its use are well worth the extra eﬀort of
learning some of its rudiments. A reformulation of Maxwell’s equations in 4-dimensional
Euclidean space is the goal of this work but an introduction to the discipline of 4-
dimensional optics was felt necessary, namely to explain the new transformation for
moving frames and its relation to Lorentz transformations in special relativity.

Through the consideration of an electromagnetic vector potential embedded in one
of the frame vectors, the paper shows that relativistic electrodynamics can be derived
from curved space geodesics. In this way the Lorentz force acquires the characteristic of
an inertial force, which is best described by inertial movement in curved space. Maxwell’s
equations are then established in this space, with geometric algebra achieving the feat of
their condensation in the equation ∇2A = J. Solving the equations for free space leads
to rotation of frame vector g0 on a plane lying on 3-space, with rotation progressing at
arbitrary frequency along the direction normal to the rotation plane. These solutions
are evanescent on the positive x0 direction and grow to inﬁnity in the opposite direction.

The inconsistency is attributed to artiﬁcial ﬂattening of the hypersphere space proposed
in previous work [3] and further work is suggested to fully clarify this point.

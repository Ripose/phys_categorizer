Abstract

The physical model (PhsMdl) of the leptons is oﬀered by means of the PhsMdls of
the vacuum and electron,described in our recent works. It is assumed that the vacuum is
consistent by dynamides, streamlined in junctions of some tight crystalline lattice. Every
dynamide contains a neutral pair of massless point-like (PntLk) contrary elementary elec-
tric charges (ElmElcChrgs): electrino (−) and positrino (+). The PntLk ElmElcChrgs
of the massless electrino and positrino of some dynamide in the ﬂuctuated vacuum may
been excited or deviated by means of some energy, introduced by some photon or other
micro particles (MicrPrts). The massless leptons (neutrinos) are neutral long-living soli-
tary spherical vortical oscillation excitations of the uncharged ﬂuctuating vacuum. The
massive leptons are charged long-living solitary spherical vortical excitations of its ﬁne
spread (FnSpr) elementary electric charge (ElmElcChrg). So-called zitterbewegung is
self-consistent strong-correlated vortical harmonic oscillation motion of the FnSpr ElmEl-
cChrg of massive leptons. Diﬀerent leptons have diﬀerent self-consistent strong-correlated
vortical harmonic oscillation motion of diﬀerent sizes of their FnSpr ElmElcChrg, which
is determined by their Kompton length λ = h
m C , where m is the mass of the massive lep-
tons. At mutual transition of one massive lepton into another massive lepton its PntLk
ElmElcChrg move up by dint of weak interaction in the form of the charged intermediate
vector meson W from one self-consistent strong-correlated vortical harmonic oscillation
motion of one size into another self-consistent strong-correlated vortical harmonic oscilla-
tion motion of another size.

Although up to the present nobody of scientists distinctly knows are there some elementary
micro particles (ElmMicrPrts) as a stone of the micro world and what the elementary micro
particle (ElmMicrPrt) means, there exists an essential possibility for clear and obvious scientiﬁc
consideration of the uncommon quantum behaviour and unusual relativistic dynamical param-
eters of all the relativistic quantized micro particle (QntMicrPrt) by means of our transparent
surveyed PhsMdl.
It is well known that the physical model (PhsMdl) presents at us as an
actual ingradient of every good physical theory (PhsThr). It may be used as for an obvious
visual teaching the unknown occurred physical processes within the investigated phenomena, It
turned out that all leptons are elementary micro particles (ElmMicrPrt) of two kinds: a charged
massive and uncharged massless. The massless leptons (neutrinos) are neutral long-living soli-
tary isotropic three dimensional relativistic quantized (SltIstThrDmnRltQnt) spherical vortex
harmonic oscillation (SphrVrtNrmOsc) excitations of the neutral ﬂuctuated vacuum (FlcVcm)
without a self-energy at a rest. The massive leptons are charged long-living solitary isotropic

1

three dimensional relativistic quantized (SltIstThrDmnRltQnt) spherical vortical harmonic os-
cillation (SphrVrtHrmOsc) motion of its ﬁne spread (FnSpr) elementary electric charge (ElmEl-
cChrg). The PhsMdl of the charged massive lepton will be presented by the PhsMdl of one
of them, the DrEl. Therefore so-called zitterbewegung by Schrodinger,which is self-consistent
strong-correlated vortical harmonic oscillation (VrtHrmOscs) motion of the FnSpr ElmElcChrg
of one of massive leptons, electron, is generalized for all charged massive leptons. Therefore
diﬀerent charged massive leptons have diﬀerent self-consistent strong-correlated vortical har-
monic oscillation motion of diﬀerent sizes of their FnSpr ElmElcChrg, which is determined
by their Kompton length λ = h
m C , where m is the mass of the massive leptons. At mutual
transition of one massive lepton into another massive lepton its PntLk ElmElcChrg move up by
means of weak interaction in the form of the charged intermediate vector meson W from one
self-consistent strong-correlated (VrtHrmOscs) motion of one size into another self-consistent
strong-correlated (VrtHrmOscs) motion of another size.

The PhsMdl of the DrEl have oﬀered in all my work in resent nineteen years for bring
of light to the physical interpretation of physical cause of the uncommon quantum behaviour
of the Schrodinger electron (SchEl) and the relativistic behaviour of the DrEl and give the
thru physical interpretation and sense of all its dynamical parameters. Our PhsMdl of the
DrEl explain as the physical causes for its unusual stochastic classical dual wave-corpuscular
behaviour and so give a new cleared picturesque physical interpretation with mother wit of the
physical means of its relativistic dynamical parameters. In our transparent surveyed PhsMdl of
the DrEl one will be regarded as some point like (PntLk) ElmElcChrg, taking simultaneously
part in four diﬀerent motions:

A) The isotropic three-dimensional relativistic quantized (IstThrDmnRltQnt) Einstein’s
stochastic (EinStch) boson harmonic shudders(BsnHrmShdrs) as a result of momentum re-
coils (impulse kicks), forcing the charged QntMicrPrt at its continuously stochastical emissions
and absorptions of own high energy (HghEnr) virtual photons (StchVrtPhtns) by its PntLk
ElmElcChrg. This jerky motion display almost Brownian classical stochastic behaviour (Brn-
ClsStchBhv) with a light velocity C during a small time interval τ1, much less then the pe-
riod T of the IstThrDmnRltQnt Schrodinger fermion (SchFrm) vortical harmonic oscillation
(VrtHrmOsc) motion and more larger then the time interval τo of the stochastically emission
or absorption of the Hgh-Enr StchVrtPhtn by its PntLk ElmElcChrg. The display of the Ist-
ThrDmnRltQnt EinStch BsnHrmShds can be observed at the light (RlPhtn) scattering of free
DrEl.
Indeed, in a consequence of the above investigation we may really consider the Ist-
ThrDmnRltQnt FrthStch VrtHrmOscMtn’s ”trajectory” of the DrEl turns into cylindrically
ﬁne spread path, which has a form of the distorted ﬁgure of eight. The participate the FnSpr
ElmElcChrg of DrEl in IstThrDmnRltQnt FrthStch VrtHrmOscMtn well spread (WllSpr) the
ElmElcChrg of the SchEl. Further the behaviour of the DrEl’s FnSpr ElmElcChrg may be
treated as a nearly Brownian classical stochastic behaviour (BrnClsStchBhv) of the ClsMicr-
Prt, taking part in the relativistic random trembling motion (RltRndTrmMtn), during the time
intervals τ1, much less then the period T of the SchFrm VrtHrmOscs and more larger then the
time interval τ of the emission and absorption of the Hgh-Enr StchVrtPhtn, the QntElcMgnFld
of which form the RslSlfCnsVls of own RslQntElcMgmFld of the DrEl’s FnSpr ElmElcChrg.
In a consequence of this the product 2 C τ may be considered as the space parth values of
the DrEl’s PntLk ElmElcChrg, which is passed in the time interval 2 τ of its absorption and
emission (or scattering) of some RlPhtn. In a consequence of this we can easily understand
by our felicitous PhsMdl why the classical radius of the LrEl entirely coincides with the size

qh ξ 2 i of a spherical ﬁne spread spot with an eﬀective scattering surface π hξ 2i. Therefore

2

the IstThrDmnRltQnt SchFrm VrtHrmOscMtn’s trajectory turns into ﬁne spread path of a
cylindrical shape with diﬀerent radii. Therefore the size of this smallest IstThrDmnRltQnt
EinStch BznHrmShd’s motion of the DrEl’s PntLk ElmElcChrg could be determined by the
Thompson total cross section. Indeed the averaged cross section of the cylindrical spread path
of the IstThrDmnRltQnt StchBsnHrmOscMtn can be determined by the eﬀective total cross
section of Thompson of RlPhtn’s scattering from the free DrEl’s, which has a space distribution
with a spherical symmetry may be easily obtained by means of the following simple relations,
well-known by us from the classical StchMch :

σ = π h ξ 2 i =

(1)

It is very important to make here, that this EinStchBznHrmShds have the smallest size and
the fastest velocity and therefore the described smallest cross section may be represented as a
described roughly by the space distribution of the DrEl’s FnSpt ElmElcChrg :

following form :

B) The isotropic three-dimensional relativistic quantized (IstThrDmnRltQnt) Schrodinger
fermion vortical harmonic oscillation motion (SchFrmVrtHrmOscMtn).
In a consequence of
such jerks of the PntLk ElmElcChrg along the IstThrDmnRltQnt EinStchHrmOscShdMtn
”trajectory” the ”trajectory” of the DrEl’s FnSpt ElmElcChrg, participating in the IstThrDm-
nRltQnt SchFrm VrtHrmOscMtn takes a strongly broken shape. Only after the correspondent
averaging over the ”trajectory” of the IstThrDmnRltQnt EinStch BznHrmShdMtn we may ob-
tain the ﬁne spread ”trajectory” of the IstThrDmnRltQnt SchFrm VrtHrmOscs’ one, having
got the form of the distorted ﬁgure of an eight. Only such a motion along a spread uncom-
mon ”trajectory” of the DrEl’s FnSpt ElmElcChrg could through a new light over the SchEl’s
well spread (WllSpr) ElmElcChrg’s space distribution and over the spherical symmetry of the
SchEl’s WllSpr ElmElcChrg. It turns up that all relativistic dynamical properties of the DrEl
are results of the participation of its ﬁne spread (FnSpr) ElmElcChrg in the Schrodinger’s
self-consistent fermion strongly correlated harmonic oscillations motion. This self-consistent
strongly correlated IstThrDmnRltQnt SchFrm VrtHrmOsc’s motion may be described mathe-
matically correctly by means of the four components of its total wave function (TtlWvFnc) Ψ
and four Dirac’s matrices ; αj (γj) and β (γo).

It turned out that all the massive leptons are sums of the corresponding massless lepton
(neutrino) and the FnSpr ElmElcChrg, which participates in some kind of a badly known but
powerfully correlated self-consistent fermion motion, called zitterbewegung. The diﬀerent mas-
sive leptons are distinguished between them-self by the amplitude size and frequency of its
IstThrDmnRltQnt SchFrm VrtHrmOscs, called zitterbewegung. Hence the diﬀerent aroma of
the leptons are diﬀerent self-consistent spherical excitations of its ﬁne spread (FnSpr) elemen-
tary electric charge (ElmElcChrg), which participates in isotropic three dimensional relativistic

3

quantized (IstThrDmnRltQnt) Schrodinger’s fermion (SchrFrm) vortical harmonic oscillations
(VrtHrmOscs) of diﬀerent sizes and frequency, which are determined by their Kompton length
λ = h
m C ,where m is the mass of the massive leptons, at diﬀerent energies, which are determined
by their mass m.

In such a way the deviated FnSpr ElmElcChrg can creates own self-consistent resultant
quantized electromagnetic ﬁelds (QntElcMgnFlds) by dint of own high energy stochastic vir-
tual photons (StchVrtPhtns), emitted by itself at diﬀerent points of its zitterbewegung trajec-
tory and in diﬀerent moments in positions of the self-consistent powerfully correlated SchrFrm
VrtHrmOscs motion. Therefore the rest self-energy of the ElmMicrPrt Eo = mc2 is created in
a results of the electromagnetic interaction (ElcMgnIntAct) between its PntLk ElmElcChrg and
MgnDplMm with the electric intensity (ElcInt) and magnetic intensity (MgnInt) of their own
QntElcMgnFld. The own resultant QntElcMgnFld of the PntLk ElmElcChrg of the charged
ElmMicrPrt is a result of the sum of the QntElcMgnFlds of constantly emitted stochastic Vrt-
Phtns by same PntLk ElmElcChrg from its diﬀerent positions of the space in the zitterbewegung
trajectory at diﬀerent moments of a time at its self-consistently powerfully correlated SchrFrm
VrtHrmOsc motion. Therefore the diﬀerent ElmMicrPrts, which are diﬀerent aromas of the
leptons, may be considered as stable excitations of diﬀerent energy in the uncharged ﬂuctuating
vacuum (FlcVcm).

C)The isotropic three-dimensional nonrelativistic quantized (IstThrDmnNrlQnt) Furthian
stochastic boson (FrthStchBsn) circular harmonic oscillation motion (CrcHrmOscMtn) of the
SchEl as a result of the permanent ElcIntAct of the electric intensity (ElcInt) of the resultant
QntElcMgnFld of all the low energetic (LwEmr) StchVrtPhtns, existing within the FlcVcm
and generated by dint of the VrtPhtn’s stochastic exchange between them. The SchEl’s motion
and its unusual quantized behaviour, described in the NrlQntMch may be easily understood
by assuming it as a forced random trembling motion (RndTrmMtn) upon a stochastic joggle
inﬂuence of the StchVrtPhtns scattering from some FrthQntPrt. Therefore the RndTrmMtn
can be approximately described through some determining calculations by means of both the
laws of the Maxwell ClsElcDnm and the probabilistic laws of the classical stochastic theory
(ClsStchThr). But in a principle the exact description of the SchEl’s uncommon behaviour can
be carry into a practice by means only of the laws of NrlQntMch and ClsElcDnm.

Since then it is easily to understand by means of upper account that if the ClsMicrPrt’s
motion is going along the clear deﬁnitived smooth thin trajectory in accordance with the Nrl-
ClsMch, then the QntMicrPrt’s motion is perform in the form of a roughly cylindrical spread
path of a cylindrical shape with diﬀerent radii with centers on a strongly broken line with quite
unordered in its direction small straight lines of the RndTrbMtn near the classical one of any
NtnClsPrt within the NrlClsMch. As a result of that we can suppose that the unusual dualistic
behaviour of QntMicrPrt can be described by dint of

rj = ¯rj + δrj

;

pj = ¯pj + δpj

;

(4)

It turns up that all the quantized dynamical properties of the SchEl are results of the par-
ticipation of its WllSpt ElmElcChrg in the isotropic three dimensional nonrelativistic quantized
(IstThrDmnNrlQnt) Furth’s stochastic (FrthStch) boson harmonic oscillations(BsnHrmOscs).
It is used as for a visual teaching the occurred physical processes within the investigated phe-
nomena, so for doing them equal with the capacity of its mathematical correct description by the
mathematical apparatus of the both the quantum mechanics : the nonrelativistic (NrlQntMch)
and relativistic (RltQntMch).

D) The classical motion of the LrEl along an well contoured smooth and thin trajectory
realized in a consequence of some classical interaction (ClsIntAct) of its over spread (OvrSpr)
ElmElcChrg, bare mass or magnetic dipole moment (MgnDplMm) with some external classical
ﬁelds (ClsFlds), described by well known laws of the Newton nonrelativistic classical mechan-
ics (NrlClsMch). This motion may be ﬁnically described by virtue of the laws of both the
NrlClsMch and the classical electrodynamics (ClsElcDnm);

We must draw attention here that two massive leptons of same aroma may been distin-
guished also by direction of its twirl. But if only massless leptons have primary twirl the
massive leptons may have both twirls. We must draw attention also here that the neutral
spherical vortex excitations may been distinguished only by direction of its twirl. As there
are possibility for two opportunity twirls then neutrino has left-handed twirl and therefore the
spin direction of the neutrino is antiparallel of its impulses direction while the antineutrino
has right-handed twirl and therefore the spin direction of the antineutrino is parallel of its im-
pulses direction. For knowing this it is very interesting why many theoretical physicists debate
frequently why there are as left-handed photons so there are and right-handed photons, but no-
body speaks about photons and antiphotons. However as because massless leptons (neurtinos)
participate in the weak interactions therefore the primary twirl may been observanted in the
weak interaction. Therefore many of them assert that there is asymmetry between weak inter-
action and electromagnetic interaction. Indeed if somebody of them call the left-handed photon
a photon and call the right-handed photon an antiphoton, then both interactions, weak and
electromagnetic should been semantically.

In is easily to perceive that at the attentive analysis of the decay formulas of the diﬀerent

lepton aromas :

τ + −→ µ+ + ˜ντ + νµ
τ − −→ µ− + ντ + ˜νµ

, τ + −→ e+ + ˜ντ + νe
, τ − −→ e− + ντ + ˜νe

, µ+ −→ e+ + ˜νµ + νe
, µ− −→ e− + νµ + ˜νe

,

,

It is seen by means of these formulas that we are ability to write the follow equations:

τ + = W + + ˜ντ , µ+ = W + + ˜νµ,

e+ = W + + ˜νe,

τ − = W − + ντ , µ− = W − + νµ,

e− = W − + νe,

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

It is easily to understand from upper that from both group decay formulas we are ability

to assume the existence of the follow decay reactions:

W + −→ τ + + ντ , W + −→ µ+ + νµ, W + −→ e+ + νe,
W − −→ τ − + ˜ντ , W − −→ µ− + ˜νµ, W − −→ e− + ˜νe,

(9)

(10)

The upper decay reaction remain us about the emmiting of a real photon (RlPht) by stim-
ulated atom. Really as we well know the Rlpht is no found within stimulated atom before its
radiation.Therefore we can speak only about the electrino,positrino and neutrinos.That is why
we can use the following formal registration:

τ + = (+) + ˜ντ , µ+ = (+) + ˜νµ,
τ − = (−) + ντ , µ− = (−) + νµ,

e+ = (+) + ˜νe,
e− = (−) + νe

(11)

(12)

But the upper decay reaction have no means that the charged intermediate vector bosons W
are composed from some aroma lepton and its neutrino, as in reality the charged intermediate
vector bosons W are created only in the time of transfer beginning od the PntLk ElmElcChrg

5

from one ElmPrt to other ElmPrt and are existed only during the time interval of same transfer.
We can distinctly see this from the following equation:

Z o = νe + ˜νe

, Z o = νµ + ˜νµ

, Z o = ντ + ˜ντ

,

(13)

The equation (13) shows that the neutral intermediate vector boson Z o contains two opposite
PntLk ElmElcChrgs (electrino and positrino). During the time interval of the decay of the
neutral intermediate vector boson Z o both its opposite PntLk ElmElcChrgs reconstruct own
self-consistent motions and annihilate, formating one dynamide, while its ﬂat motions decay in
two parallel neutral spherical vortical excitations: neutrino and antineutrino of same aroma.

But the upper decay reaction have no means that the some massive charged lepton is
composed from same aroma neutrino and the PntLk ElmElcChrg of the negative charged inter-
mediate vector bosons W − and every massive antilepton is sum of its antineutrino and positive
charged intermediate vectorial boson W +. Indeed, although the decay of one lepton from an-
other lepton is accompanied with leaping its negative PntLk ElmElcChrgthe in a state of the
negative charged intermediate vectorial boson W − from one neutrino to another neutrino. But
this decay don’t means that every massive lepton is sum of its neutrino and negative charged
intermediate vectorial boson W − Really we can think that some massive lepton receives energy
from ﬂuctuating vacuum (FlcVcm) by dint of some virtual photon (VrtPhtn) or virtual gluon
(VrtGln) and therefore it generate neutrino of its aroma in time moment of its transition in
state of the negative charged intermediate vectorial boson W − In such the way the unstable
negative charged intermediate vectorial boson W − gives back of FlcVcm borrowing from it en-
ergy in form of the VrtPhtn or VrtGln and after that its negative PntLk ElmElcChrg emits the
antineutrino of same aroma, which aroma has the lepton massive state, which it occupy, with-
out disintegrating itself of the negative charged intermediate vectorial boson W − and massless
neutrino.

However there is possibility to understand by means of upper decay relation why exist lepton
and antilepton numbers and weak charges, satisfying the conservation laws and why absent the
electric charge from symmetry law. Indeed, if negative charged intermediate vectorial boson
W − has spin minus ¯h, then in order to some lepton with spin a minus half ¯h, we must add
only the antineutrino with spin a half ¯h. If we wish to make some antilepton, then to neutrino
with a spin minus half ¯h we must accompanied with leaping the positive charged intermediate
vectorial boson W + with a spin ¯h.

The upper decay group formulas teach us that the PntLk ElmElcchrg of diﬀerent leptons
participates in some IstThrDmnRltQnt self-consistent and powerful correlated SchrFrnHrmOsc
motion (zitterbewegung) of diﬀerent sizes and at diﬀerent energies. Therefore at the mu-
tual transitions between them there give birth of pair neutrino νl and antineutrino ˜νl of the
same aroma and the PntLk ElmElcChrd pass from own neutrino (antineutrino) to the new
birthed neutrino (antineutrino) in the form of the charged intermediate vectorial boson W .
This is a natural way from which we can see the unity of the ﬁeld neutral excitations in the
FlcVcm and its substantial charged excitations, oﬀered by modernity relativistic quantum me-
chanics (RltQntMch), quantum electrodynamics (QntElcDnm) and quantum theory of ﬁeld
(QntThrFld). The electric interaction (ElcIntAct) of the resultant QntElcMgnFld of all the
StchVrtPhtns, exchanged from the FlcVcm with the ElmMicrPrt’s PntLk ElmElcChrg creates
their diverse oscillations along its classical well contoured smooth and thin trajectory, spread
and turned it into wide path, described by its OrbWvFnc (Ψ) within the nonrelativistic quan-
tum mechanics (NrlQntMch) .

6

It turns out that we describe only three aroma massive and massless leptons. In approxi-
mation of a mathematical correct substitution of the three one-dimensional powerful correlated
fermion harmonic oscillations with three one-dimensional independent boson harmonic oscilla-
tions the size of each aroma of leptons is determined by length of its Kompton wave λ = h
m C .
As the masses of three massive lepton aromas have very big diﬀerent values (1, 207, 1785)meC 2,
then and the size of each lepton aroma must very strong diﬀer one from other. Here I wish to
show one very interesting coincidence. Indeed, if the total energy of each charged massive lep-
tons is a sum of its self-energy of rest m.C 2 and of the potential energy of its PntLk ElmElcChrg
in own averaged QntElcMfnFld (2/3) e2
C¯h m.C 2, then the total energy of the muon µ mµ.C 2 is
equal of the sum of its self-energy of rest mµ.C 2 and of the energy of the electron me.C 2, which
e2
is the potential energy of its PntLk ElmElcChrg in own averaged QntElcMgnFld 2
C¯h mµ.C 2.
Indeed :

3

or

( 1 + 205.54 ) ∼= 206.7

(14)

me ( 1 + (3/2)

C¯h

e2 ) ∼= mµ

Really by means of upper equation (14) we can assert that the total energy me.C 2 of
the electron is an equal of the potential energy of the PntLk ElmElcChrg of muon in own
averaged QntElcMgnFld. From research of the upper decay formulas we can understand that
the weak interaction is result of the charged (or neutral) intermediate vector bosons W (or
Z) mutually interchange between leptons and others elementary micro particles (ElmMicrPrt).
The formation of the lepton with a spin of the half of ¯h from charged intermediate vector boson
W with a spin of one ¯h and another lepton with a spin of the half of ¯h determines the choice
rule of the participating the lepton in this interaction.

The relation E 2 = p2c2 +m2c4 between the energy, impulse and mass of the ClsMacrPrt may
be obtained through the use of the Maxwell’s equations of the classical electrodynamics (ClsEl-
cDnm),as a result of the relation between the harmonic oscillations of the impulse of a charged
ClsMacrPrt and the vector-potential of its ClsElcMgnFld. The parameters of own resultant
QntElcMgnFld in the point of the moment positions of the QntMicrPrt’s PntLk ElmElcChrg
and value of its rest-self energy may be determined by the agency of the mathematical appa-
ratus of the RltQntMch, QntThrFld and QntElcDnm. The created by this way own resultant
QntElcMgnFld have zero values of the electric intensity (ElcInt) of own resultant QntElcFld
in the point of the moment position of a MicrPrt’s PntLk ElmElcChrg and doubled value of
the magnetic intensity (MgnInt) of own resultant QntMgnFld in this point in a respect of the
MgnInt of the ClsMgnFld, created by the small spread (SmlSpr) ElmElcChrg, participating
in isotropic three dimensional relativistic classical (IstThrDmnRltCls) Debay boson harmonic
oscillations (DbBsnHrmOscs) with same the energy.

The electric interaction (ElcIntAct) of the resultant QntElcMgnFld of the StchVrtPhtns
from the ﬂuctuating vacuum (FlcVcm) with a ElmMicrPrt’s WllSpr ElmElcChrg creates their
diverse oscillations along its classical trajectory, spread and turned into an wide path within the
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics (NrlQunMch). Such IstThrDmnRltQnt Furthian stochastic
boson circular harmonic oscillation motion (FrthStchBsnCrcHrmOscMtn) secures the existence
of an additional mechanical moment (MchMm) of the QntMicrPrt, as and anomalous part of
its MgnDplMm. The energy of the StchVrtPhtns exchanged between QntMicrPrt’s WllSpr
ElmElcChrg and the FlcVcm gives a possibility of the QntMicrPrts to make tunneling through
potential barriers, which are impassable in a classical way. The QntMicrPrt gathers from the
FlcVcm at its IstThrMrnRltQnt BrnStchBsnCrcHrmOscMtn for potential energies of an aver-
aged ElcFld of its WllSpr ElmElcChrg. Therefore the potential energies of this ﬁeld don’t take
part in equations between an inserted energy in the beginning of the birth of the ElmMicrPrts

7

and obtained after its end.

These isotropic three dimensional relativistic quantized (IstThrDmnRltQnt) Schrodinger
fermion vortical harmonic oscillation (SchFrmVrtHrmOsc) motion (zitterbewegung) of the Elm-
MicrPrt’s FnSpr ElmElcChrg correspond to its inner harmonical motion, introduced by Louis de
Broglier. The Schrodinger’s zitterbewegung is some powerful correlation fermion self-consistent
motion, who minimizes the rest self-energy of the ElmMicrPrt and secures the continuous sta-
bility of the Schrodinger’s wave package (SchWvPck) in the space inanalogous of the Debay
wave package (DbWvPck). In such a way we understand that the energetical advantage of the
self-consistent strong correlated zitterbewegung, which minimizes the energy of ElcMgnSlfAct
between the FnSpr ElmElcChrg and its own resultant QntElcMgnFld secures the stability of
the SchrWvPck in the space and time.

The emission and absorption of high energy StchVrtPhtns by the PntLk ElmElcChrg of
the charged ElmMicrPrt forces itself to make a isotropic three-dimensional relativistic quan-
tized (IstThrDmnRltQnt) Einstein stochastic (EinStch) boson harmonic oscillation motion
(BsnHrmOscMtn), which makes the smooth trajectory of the SchrFrm VrtHrmOscMtn a thickly
and strongly broken line with shortest and very disordered straight lines. The ﬁne spread (Fn-
Spr) of the SchrFrm VrtHrmOscMtn’s trajectory by very rapid jerk EinStch BsnHrmOscMtn
may be observed at the scattering of the light (RlPhtns) on the free Dirac electrons (DrEl).
Indeed, the IstThrDmnRltQnt SchrFrm VrtHrmOscMtn’s trajectory turns into roughly spread
path of a cylindrical shape with diﬀerent radii. The averaged cross section of the cylindrical
spread path of the IstThrDmnRltQnt StchBsn VrtHrmOscMtn can be determined by Thomp-
son total cross section σ = 8π
of the of the light (RlPhtns) at the free DrEl ,which
determines the classical radius ro = 2e2

Although till now nobody knows what the ElmmICRpRT means, there exists a possibility
for a consideration of the unusual behaviour of the quantized micro particles (QntMicrPrts),
of such as leptons and adrons by dint of an analogy with the transparent surveyed PhsMdl
of the DrEl. By our PhsMdl of the leptons at transition of the PntLk ElmElkChrg from one
massless leptons (its neutrino) to another massless leptons (its neutrino) it takes form of a
charged intermediate vector meson W . In such a way the weak interaction between two leptons
may be realized by a transition of one PntLk ElmElcChrg from one neutrino (anti neutrino) to
another neutrino (antineutrino) in the form of a charged intermediate vector meson W .

It seems to me the existance of two very interesting facts,having common physical cause.The
ﬁrst is concurrence of the energy of one degree of freedom in charged lepton µ-meson and in
charged admeson π-meson. Indeed, if in isotropic three dimensional solitary vortical harmonic
ocsillations of FnSpr ElmElcChrg of µ-meson have three degrees of freedom and therefore
3 ¯h ω = 2 m C 2 = 213.2Mev. Hence the energy of one degree of freedom can be determined
¯h ω
2 = 35.5Mev. If we take into consideration that the FnSpr ElmElcChrg of π-meson takes
participation in two quasi-plane circular harmonic oscillations with opportunity orientations
and therefore has energy 2¯hω = 139.6Mev. Hence the energy of one degree of freedom can
be determined ¯h ω
2 = 34.9Mev. As we can see by comparision of two results this coincidence
is very accurate. On this reason we can assume that the areas of their oscillations must also
coincidence and therefore the OrbWvFnc of both FnSpr ElmElcChrg. May be therefore the
decay of the positive (negative) charged π-meson in 100% occurs through the positive (negative)
µ-meson and µ-neutrino (antineutrino). This second coincidence gives us many correct answer
of the question for inner structure of the elementary micro particles (ElmMicrPrts).

I think that is very interesting to wtite the equations of the incomprehencible decay down:

π+ =⇒ W + =⇒ µ+ + νµ

, π− =⇒ W − =⇒ µ− + ˜νµ,

π+ =⇒ W + =⇒ e+ + νe

, π− =⇒ W − =⇒ e− + ˜νe,

As for the radiation of the spontaneous real photon (RlPhtn) from the excitative atom it
is necessary the presence of the virtual photon (VrtPhtn) for the creation of the electric dipole
moment (ElcDplMm), so for the decay of a charged π-meson it is necessary the presence of a
virtual gluon for an overturning of the spin of one of its quarks, by which charged π-meson
turns into charged virtual ρ-meson, which can immediately decay into charged intermediate
vector boson W . At the subsequent transfer of the charged intermediate vector bozon W in
a pair of massive and massless leptons of equal aroma the participating in the decay gluon go
back in the FlcVcm. Therefore instead of upper decays we must used the following equations :

π+ + δ =⇒ W + =⇒ µ+ + νµ

, π− + δ =⇒ W − =⇒ µ− + ˜νµ,

π+ + δ =⇒ W + =⇒ e+ + νe

, π− + δ =⇒ W − =⇒ e− + ˜νe,

For the ﬁrst time in a hundred-years history of an electron, common known as the smallest
stable ElmMicrPrt, there exist a posibility for a consideration of its unusual behaviour by means
of a transparent PhsMdl realized in a natural way without any irreconcilable contradictions. I
cherish hope that our consideration from quit new point of view of my PhsMdl of all leptons
by means of the PhsMdl of the electron will be of great interes for all scientists. Our PhsMdl
explain as the structure of leptons and adrons and the nature of their interaction so the existence
of a possibility for joint description of a ﬁeld and substantial form of the matter as unity whole
in the physical science, which are submitted to an united, fundamental and invariable laws of
nature.

Abstract

New approach to the description of a gravitation using analogy between the optical and mechanical phenomenon is
advanced. For this purpose in extended (1+4)-dimensional space G(1, 4) the gravitational eﬀects are considered: the
speed of escape, red shift, radar echo, deviation light and perihelion precession of Mercury. It is shown, that methods
of the Extended Space Model (ESM) give the same outcomes, as General Theory of Relativity (GR). The various
ways of introduction of refraction index are discussed, which appropriate to the gravitational ﬁeld.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is known, that between the mechanical and optical phenomena there is a certain likeness, which historically was
exhibited that a set of the optical phenomena managed uniformly well to be described both within the framework
of wave, and within the framework of the corpuscular theories.
In particular, motion of a beam of light in an
inhomogeneous medium in many respects similar to motion of a material particle in a potential ﬁeld [1]. In the given
activity, we shall take advantage of this connection to describe the gravitational phenomena. Will be shown, that it
is possible to receive such eﬀects of General Theory of Relativity (GR), as red shift, radar echo, deviation of light and
a perihelion precession of a Mercury, using ideas and methods of geometric optics.

In the papers [2-7] the Extended Space Model (ESM) and the electrodynamics in this space was constructed. ESM
are by generalization of a Special Theory of Relativity (GR) on (1 + 4) - dimensional space which having the metric
(+ - - - -). We designate it as G(1, 4). Space of the Minkowski M (1, 3) is a subspace of the ESM. The role of the ﬁfth
coordinates in space G(1, 4) plays an interval in space of the Minkowski M (1, 3). We shall designate its by letter S.
One of the characteristics of this theory is that in it the rest mass of particles - is a variable and a photon, falling

in the medium with the refraction index n > 1, acquires nonzero mass.

The probability that a photon has nonzero mass is widely discussed both theorists, and experimenters. The review
of the last outcomes is contained in [8]. Our approach diﬀers by that in ESM mass of a particle is not constant, and
is determined by external eﬀects, which it experiences, theme processes, in which it participates.

According to philosophy of extended space external eﬀects on any object are described as change of refraction index
n in a point, where there is a given object. Formally such processes within the framework of our model are described
by rotations in extended space G(1, 4) [2,6]. One of the main physical problems in ESM is how to compare particular
interactions with appropriated to them distributions of an index of refraction. In each separate case, this problem is
decided in its own way.

Gravitational ﬁeld is one of examples of physical objects, to which compares some refraction index. From the very
beginning origins, GTR there was a problem of its experimental checking. The majority of observable gravitational
eﬀects connected with the optical phenomena and with a behavior of photons in a gravitational ﬁeld. One of such
eﬀects is, in particular - deviation of light in a gravitational ﬁeld. This deviation can be interpreted as motion of a
light ray in environment with an inhomogeneous refraction index. Thus, we can to compare to a gravitational ﬁeld
some index of refraction.

In this paper, we will consider well-known gravitational eﬀects, used for the GR conﬁrmation. In addition, we shall
show, that all of them can be described and in frameworks ESM. Let’s mark also, that now attempts in a new way
to interpret the gravitational eﬀects are considered by other authors [9-13].

For free particles the components of vector (2) satisfy to an equation

E2 = c2p2

x + c2p2

i.e. this vector is isotropic.

Parameter n links speed of light in vacuum c with speed of light in the medium v = c/n. By the help of it is possible
to deﬁne ﬁfth coordinate in space G(1, 4). Thus the empty Minkowski space M (1, 3) corresponds to n = 1. In this
medium light is gone with speed c. Hit of light in medium with n
= 1 is interpreted as an exit of a photon from the
Minkowski space and transition of light in other subspace of space G(1, 4). Such transition can be described with the
help of rotations in space G(1, 4). All types of such rotations are investigated in [2,6].

In blank space in a ﬁxed reference system there are two types of various object, with zero and nonzero masses. In

space G(1, 4) to them there are corresponds 5-vectors

The important property of transformations (6) (10) is that mass of a photon, which it generates, can have both
positive and negative sign. It follows immediately from properties of a symmetry of space G(1, 4). As to particles,
which initially had positive mass, after transformations (8), (13) it remains positive.

III. REFRACTION INDEX OF A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

Let’s study now a problem of refraction index of a gravitational ﬁeld. Let there is a dot mass, which gravitational
ﬁeld is described by the Schwarzchild solution. We assume, that the gravitational radius rg is small and we shall
consider all eﬀects on distances r > rg.

In the literature there are two expressions for an index of refraction n, appropriate to a Schwarzchild ﬁeld. One of

them, we shall name it n1, is used in papers of the Okun [15,16] and looks like

It is received in the supposition, that in a constant gravitational ﬁeld the frequency of a photon ω remains to a
constant, but the wavelength λ and speed v varie. Other index of refraction n2 is possible to receive from the formula
of an interval in a weak gravitational ﬁeld [14]

Where ϕ - is a potential of a gravitational ﬁeld. Supposing dr = v dt and ds2 = 0, we shall receive speed of a photon

distance r from a source of a ﬁeld, particles energy will increase up to size E = m0c2 + (γm0M )/r. Collins oﬀers to
interpret this change of energy as change of a rest mass in a gravitational ﬁeld.

Then he uses a conservation law of a momentum mv = m0v0 and receives the law of change of speed in a gravitational
ﬁeld

Supposing, that this law is distributed also to photons, we receive the formula for change of photons speed in a
gravitational ﬁeld

It is possible to interpret the formulas (20), (23) as hit of a photon in medium with a refraction index

In that case, when the speed of a particle v is comparable to the speed of light c, in the formula (21) it is necessary

to take into account relativistic correction to a rest-mass m and to record it as

Appropriate refraction index will look like

Such diﬀerence in deﬁnition of refraction index of a gravitational ﬁeld is connected with that the speech in these
cases goes about diﬀerent objects, which diﬀerently interact with a gravitational ﬁeld. In ESM to these situations
there corresponds also diﬀerent rotations in extended space.

IV. GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS IN ESM

1) Speed of escape.
Speed of escape v2 is that speed, which should be given to a body located on a surface of the Earth, that it could
be deleted from Earth on an indeﬁnitely large distance. Let M - mass of the Earth, m - mass of a body located at
the Earth surface, and R - radius of this surface. The expression for the speed of escape is [18]

We will receive now formula (27) using ESM methods.
Let’s consider a massive particle at rest, which removed to inﬁnite large distance from the Earth. Within the
framework of our model such particle is described by isotropic 5-vector of energy-momentum-mass (5). Space motion
in gravitational ﬁeld along an axis X can compare movement in extended space G(1, 4) in a plane XS from a point
with refraction index n = 1 to point with refraction index n(r). Such motion is described by a rotation (13).
Here rotation angle ψ express through refraction index n. Thus the massive particle at rest acquires speed

As to in this case we consider a motion of a massive body, we assume natural to use refraction index n2. Assuming,
that it is close to unit, i.e. that

In case, when r = R - radius of the Earth, the formula (29) coincides with the formula (27) and gives the speed of
escape v = v2.
2) Red shift.
Gravitational red shift usually considered as a change of frequency of a photon in the case of changing of a
gravitational ﬁeld, in which photon is merged. In particular, at decreasing of strength of a ﬁeld the frequency of a
photon also decreases, that is it reddens [14]. However Okun oﬀers to recognize that not frequency varies but varies
wavelength of a photon, and just it to name as red displacement [9,10]. Under our judgment both cases are possible,
but they corresponds to diﬀerent physical situations and are described by diﬀerent rotation angle ψ express through
refraction index n.

In a general theory of relativity the formula that describes change of light frequency is [14]

ω =

ω0

√g00 ≈

ω0

1 +

(cid:18)

γM
rc2 (cid:19)

.

Here ω0 - frequency of a photon measured in universal time, it remains constant at propagation of a beam of light.
And ω - frequency of the same photon which measured in its own time. This frequency is various in various points of
space. If the photon was emitted by a massive star, near to a star at small r the frequency of a photon is more, than
far from it at large r. On inﬁnity in the ﬂat space, where there is no gravitational ﬁeld, the universal time coincides
with own and ω0 there is an observable frequency of a photon.

Let’s consider now same problem from the point of view of ESM.
Within the framework of our model to a photon located in blank space, the isotropic 5-vector (4) is compared.
Process of its movement to the point with refraction index n, at which the change it of frequency happens, so also of
energy, is described by a rotation in (T S) - plane. At these rotations the photon vector will be transformed se, when
r = R - radius of the Earth, the formula (29) coincides the formula (27) and gives the speed of escape v = v2. From
here it is visible, that ω0 - frequency of a photon in vacuum and ω - it frequency in a ﬁeld are connected by a ratio d
shift.

We assume, that at calculation of change of photon frequency it is necessary to use refraction index n2 , as to the
index of refraction n1 was found in the supposition, that this frequency does not vary. Substituting (24) in (31), we
receive the formula

ω = ω0n2 = ω0

1 +

γM
rc2 (cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

which coincides the formula (30). Thus in extended space model for red shift is received the same expression, as in
general theory of relativity.

In papers [15,16] Okun has oﬀered to consider red shift of a photon as change it of speed, momentum and wavelength,
but the frequency was assumed constant. He proceeded from a dispersing ratio for a photon with zero mass in space
with the Schwarzchild metric

Let’s look now at transformations (34) - (36) from the ESM point of view.
As the frequency of a photon remains constant, but vary its momentum and mass the appropriate transformation
must be described by a rotation in the plane (XS) of the spaces G(1, 4). As the frequency does not vary, we take
refraction index n1. At such rotation the speed of a photon varies according to the formula

v = c cos ψ =

c
n 1

.

This formula coincides the formula (36) for transformation of speed. Being repelled from it is possible to receive the
formula (35), assigning change of a wavelength of a photon, when photon hit in a gravitational ﬁeld. As if to the
formula (34) naturally we can not to receive it, as to we should use at calculations not a dispersing ratio (32), but
curved in (1 + 4)-dimensional Schwarzchild metric analog of a full dispersing ratio of a photon in space G(1, 4)

From a point of view of our model it is necessary to consider the formula (31) only as ﬁrst approximation to an
exact result. Let’s estimate correction appropriate to that in this model the photon, hitting in area with n > 1 gains
a nonzero mass. For this reason the part of a photon energy can be connected not to frequency, but with the mass.
Let’s estimate magnitude of this energy for case, when photon frequency change, in case of incident from a height H
in a homogeneous gravitational ﬁeld, with acceleration of gravity g is measured. Such situation was realized in well
known Pound and Rebka experiments [19]. The energy change which appropriated to such frequency shift, is equal

According to the formula (6) in the case of rotation in plane (T S) the photon gains a mass

The diﬀerence of potential energies in the point of emission and point of absorption of a photon, which diﬀer by height

We see, that correction to eﬀect connected to emerging of the photons nonzero mass, near to the Earth surface is only
10−5 from magnitude of the total eﬀect.

3) Delay of radar echo.

6

The appearance of radar echo delay is, that the time of light distribution up to some object, and back, can diﬀer
in dependence from that, does this light spread in a hollow, or in a gravitational ﬁeld. Such delay was measured in
experiments on location of Mercury and Venus [20]. Such experiments give satisfactory agreement with GR predictions.
These experiments also were analyzed in [21]. Here we do not interesting to analysis of these work. We want only to
indicate that the analytical expression for magnitude of delay of a radar echo in ESM coincides what is received in
GR.

This result can be obtained from the fact that the photon time delay ∆t is calculated from only from the photon

velocity v(t) [15,16]. Let’s imagine that we locate the Sun. In this case we have

∆t = 2 

Here Rs - radius of the Sun, rg - gravitational radius of the Sun, and re - distance from the Earth up to the Sun.

Speed of light in a gravitational ﬁeld is v = c
to select n = n1. Substituting it in (43), we obtain

n . As here we deal with photons, as a refraction index it is necessary

The formula (44) coincides with expression for magnitude of radar echo delay obtained in work [16,21].

4) In general theory of relativity magnitude of deviation angle δψ of a light beam from a rectilinear trajectory in
case of photon motion near to a massive body determine, deciding the eyconal equation which deﬁning trajectory of
this beam in a central-symmetrical gravitational ﬁeld [14]. In this case we receive the answer

Here M - mass of a body, and R - distance at which the light beam passes from a ﬁeld center.

As in this case speech goes about photons motion it is necessary to select n = n1. Let’s consider two beams - one
Rs < r. In

passes precisely through an edge of the Sun, and other at a distance h from it. It is supposed, that h
case of passing by these rays of a linear segment of length dx the residual of optical paths will be

5) Perihelion precession of Mercury
One more classical GR eﬀect is the perihelion precession of Mercury. It arises due to a space curvature the Newton’s
law of an attraction is deformed. It reduces that the trajectory of a partile becomes nonclosed, and after of each
rotation it the perihelion precessed at some angle. The magnitude of this rotation is determined by the law of
interaction of a central mass M and mass m particles rotated around it. In case of a Schwarzchild potential the force
of interaction of these masses is [22]

Here rg - gravitational radius of mass M , and v - velocity of moving at the orbit partile with mass m. The Mercury
velocity of motion at the orbit around the Sun is equal approximately 48 km/s, that gives magnitude of the relativistic
correction v2/c2

10−8 and it is comparable with relativistic correction. It is
possible to consider, that in the formula (49) masses of a partile m depend on a distance and velocity. But as both
these corrections are small, the total transformation of mass m can be write as

10−8.

The calculation with use of force (49) and including into account an approximation (50) gives an value of perihelium
precession of Mercury close to observed. Let’s consider now this case in ESM framework.

We have a partile with a nonzero mass were in a gravitational ﬁeld. As the partile has a nonzero mass, it is necessary
to use the refraction index n2. This is similar to our way of estimation of the escape velocity. As the relativistic
correction in this case cannot be neglected, we shall use an index of refraction n′
2, which is determined by the formula
(26). However, now ”motion” of a partile from area with refraction index n = 1 to the area with refraction index n′
2
does not deﬁned by real motion particle in space. Such ”motion” determined by changing of the force magnitude,
operating on a partile, i.e. this is the case of particle energy modiﬁcation. Therefore in this case it is necessary to
use a (TS) rotation in extended space G(1, 4).In the case of such rotation the massive vector (5) will be transformed
in accordance with (8). Thus in case of such rotation the massive partile changes the mass

That fact, that in the formula (8) both signs have a direct physical sense, means, that in case of such transformation
from one partile with a mass m there can origin two partiles with diﬀerent masses.

V. DISCUSSION

We shall assume, that in a macroscopic massive body there is an equal number of partiles which converts under

the laws (52), (53), and consequently we shall use the average law of transformation

We see, that the formula (54) coincides the formula (50).

We have shown, that the GR predictions can be received, based on analogies between optical and mechanical
phenomena. For this purpose it is enough to use only technique of rotations in extended space G(1, 4) and formula for
the refraction index in the Schwarzchild metric. Any additional ideas and suppositions were not attracted. Actually
obtained results are only ﬁrst approximation in an evaluation of magnitude of gravitational eﬀects.

These results can be improved, taking into account physical processes, which happen in extended space. So for
example, calculation of magnitude of light deviation it was not taken into account, that the photon in a gravitational
ﬁeld gains a mass, and on it aﬀected additional force of an attraction. However, it seems, that the magnitude of these
additional eﬀects is insigniﬁcant. This is showing an example of an evaluation of correction (32) to the frequency of
a photon in the gravitational ﬁeld.

However, the purpose of this work was not an evaluation of such corrections and arguing of possibilities of their
real observation. Our purpose was to demonstrate that the ESM methods in the standard GR tasks give right results.
In future we assume to use this results in the tasks of cosmology for description of dark energy and dark substance,
which explanations have not received yet. Therefore that fact, that in well-known situations ESM works well. This
gives hope that, and for other tasks model too will give right results.

SUMMARY

The new Dynamic Model of Wave-Particle Duality elaborated is
devoted to analysis of the internal (hidden) parameters of elemen-
tary de Broglie waves (waves B) and their interrelation with external,
observable ones. Dynamic model is based on assumption of alterna-
tive pulsation of sub-elementary particles, between the corpuscular
[C] and wave [W] phase, each of them representing corresponding
semiperiod of wave B. The triplets of sub-elementary particles form
the elementary particles. The energy and impulse of sub-elementary
particles and antiparticle, composing coherent pair, compensate each
other. The resulting properties of each triplet: mass, spin, charge is
determined by uncompensated sub-elementary particle. The model
considers the positive and negative vacuum as two ’oceans’ of su-
perﬂuid quantum liquid, composed from virtual quanta of opposite
energies. This interacting positive and negative vacuum, termed BI-
VACUUM, is an inﬁnitive source of bi-vacuum bosons (BVB). The
spatial image of BVB is a pair of [rotor + antirotor] of opposite di-
rection of rotation in the energetic planes of positive and negative
vacuum with the radius, close to Compton radius of the electron,
muon or tau-electron, depending on the resonant energetic slit value
of bi-vacuum. Due to impulse and energy compensation there are no
size limitations for BVB. The minimum radius of BVB may be deter-
mined by Plank’s length. Such small BVB may serve as a ”molecules”
of bi-vacuum as a quantum superﬂuid liquid. The nonlocal properties
of BVB are the consequence of their zero resulting impulse, responsi-
ble for their inﬁnitive virtual wave B length and corresponding scale
of PRIMORDIAL bi-vacuum Bose condensation. In SECONDARY
vacuum, with symmetry, perturbed by presence of matter, the im-
pulse of BVB becomes non zero. As a result, the inﬁnitive virtual
Bose condensate ’dissociate’ to huge superﬂuid bi-vacuum domains.
The gradient of diﬀerence of concentration of rotors and antirotors
with opposite direction of rotation (virtual spin equilibrium shift),
originated under the inﬂuence of rotating atoms, molecules or macro-
scopic bodies - is responsible for TORSION ﬁeld. The transmission
of signal in form of energetic slit symmetric pulsation of bi-vacuum,
representing the vacuum amplitude waves (VAW) in the membrane of

1

bi-vacuum Bose condensate is instant. It is not related with energy-
impulse propagation. The Corpuscular and Wave phase of particles
are considered in our model as two alternative phase of wave B,
which are in dynamic equilibrium. The wave [W]- PHASE in form
of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) originates as a result of quan-
tum beats between real and mirror states of corpuscular [C] phase
of sub-elementary particles, composing elementary particles.
It is
shown that CVC has a spatial image of half of parted (two-cavity)
hyperboloid. This half is in realm of positive or negative vacuum
for sub-particles and sub-antiparticles, correspondingly. The CVC is
composed from virtual density waves (VDW), responsible for elec-
tric component of resulting electromagnetic charge and from virtual
symmetry waves (VSW), related to magnetic component of resulting
charge.

The product of two components is equal to resulting charge squared.
The VAW interference with standing VDW and VSW (scalar waves),
excited by symmetric pairs of sub-particle and sub-antiparticle may
be responsible for Informational ﬁeld origination.

It leads from equations obtained, that small part of CVC energy
determined by ﬁne structure constant is responsible for electromag-
netism and much smaller part of CVC - for gravitation. Our model
uniﬁes electromagnetism and gravitation in natural way. The restora-
tion of [C]-PHASE in form of [real+mirror] mass-dipole is a result of
binding of CVC to BVB, accompanied by excitation of BVB. The
spatial image of sub-particle in [C]-phase is a correlated pair [mirror
rotor + real vortex]. The energies of both phase [C] and [W] are
equal.

Propagation of fermion in bi-vacuum is a jump-way process, be-
cause the [W] is luminal in contrast to [C] phase. The frequency of
[C-W] pulsation is equal to frequency of quantum beats between real
and mirror corpuscular states.

Our dynamic duality model elucidates the quantum background
of non-locality, principle of least action and Golden mean, uniﬁes
the quantum and relativist theories. Tending of the open systems to
conditions of Golden mean is supposed to be a driving force of their
self-organization. It is shown also that the pace of time - changes with
opposite sign with pace of kinetic energy for each selected closed sys-
tem. It leads from formulae obtained, that pace of time is interrelated
with electromagnetic and gravitational energy change. The notions
of TEMPORAL waves and ﬁeld has been introduced. Our approach
serves as a key to Superuniﬁcation.

Introduction

Einstein never accepted the Bohr’s philosophy, that properties of particles
cannot be analyzed without direct experimental control. Bohr’s objection of

2

EPR paradox was based on this point.

David Bohm was the ﬁrst one, who made an attempt to explain wholeness of
the Universe, without loosing the causality principle. Experimental discovery:
”Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect” (1950) pointing that electron is able to ”feel” the pres-
ence of a magnetic ﬁeld even in a regions where the probability of ﬁeld existing
is zero, was stimulating. For explanation of nonlocality Bohm introduced in
1952 the notion of quantum potential, which pervaded all of space. But unlike
gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds, its inﬂuence did not decrease with dis-
tance. All the particles are interrelated by very sensitive to any perturbations
quantum potential. This means that signal transmission between particles oc-
curs instantaneously. The idea of quantum potential or active information is
close to notion of pilot wave, proposed by de Broglie at the Solvay Congress
in 1927. In our model instead quantum potential we introduced the notion of
informational vacuum amplitude waves (VAW). These waves have a concrete
interpretation in the framework of our model.

Actually Bohm develops the de Broglie idea of pilot wave, applying it for
many-body system. In 1957 Bohm published a book: Causality and Chance in
Modern Physics. Later he comes to conclusion, that Universe has a properties
of giant, ﬂowing hologram. Taking into account its dynamic nature, he prefer
to use term: holomovement. In his book: Wholeness and the Implicate Order
(1980) he develops an idea that our explicated unfolded reality is a product of
enfolded (implicated) or hidden order of existence. He consider the manifesta-
tion of all forms in the universe as a result of enfolding and unfolding exchange
between two orders, determined by super quantum potential.

According to Bohm, manifestation of corpuscle - wave duality of particle
is dependent on the way, which observer interacts with a system. Both of this
properties are always enfolded in a quantum system. It is a basic diﬀerence with
our model, assuming that the wave and corpuscle phase are realized alternatively
with high frequency during two diﬀerent semiperiods of de Broglie wave (wave
B).

Bohm, like Einstein, rejected the statement, that particles can not be consid-
ered until they are observed. In his last book, written with Basil Hiley: ”THE
UNDIVIDED UNIVERSE. An ontological interpretation of quantum theory”
(1993), he considered the electron as a particle with well- deﬁned position and
momentum which are, however, under inﬂuence of special wave (quantum po-
tential). Particle in accordance with this authors is a sequence of incoming and
outgoing waves, which are very close to each other. However, particle itself does
not have a wave nature after Bohm. Interference pattern in double slit exper-
iment is a result of periodically ”bunched” character of quantum potential in
Bohm’s view.

In accordance to ﬁrst version of our model (see next section), one of two

standing neutrino (2ν0) in the coherent triplet [2ν0 +eν0], composing the electron

as a coherent dynamic system, is always in the corpuscular state in each of two
semiperiods. The pair of standing neutrino and antineutrino are pulsing between
Corpuscular [C] and Wave [W] states in-phase, compensating the inﬂuence of

3

energy, spin and charge of each other on vacuum symmetry. The bunched
character of the electron’s trajectory can be a result of impulses, produced
by uncompensated standing neutrino in a course of its [C ⇋ W ] pulsations,
accompanied by outgoing and incoming Cumulative Virtual Cloud (CVC). At
this point our model has some similarity with idea of Bohm.

However, our duality model can explain the nonlocality and double slit
experiment without using the notion of quantum potential or pilot-wave, but
by the internal (hidden) dynamics of the components of elementary particles.

The important point of Bohmian philosophy, coinciding with our theory, is

that everything in the Universe is a part of dynamic continuum.

Neurophysiologist Karl Pribram made the next exciting step in the same di-
rection as Bohm: ”The brain is a hologram enfolded in a holographic Universe”.
The good popular description of Bohm and Pribram ideas are presented in
books: The Bell’s theorem and the curious quest for quantum reality (1990) by
David Peat and ”The Holographic Universe” (1992) by Michael Talbot.

Such original concepts are interesting and stimulating, indeed, but should
be considered as a ﬁrst attempts to transform intuitive perception of duality
and quantum wholeness into clear geometrical and mathematical models.

In 1950 John Wheeler and Charles Misner published Geometrodynamics,
a new description of space-time properties, based on topology. Topology is
more general than Euclidean geometry and deeper than non-Euclidean, used
by Einstein in his General theory of relativity. Topology does not deal with
distances, angles and shapes. Drawn on a sheet of stretching rubber, a circle,
triangle and square are indistinguishable. A ball, pyramid and a cube also can
be transformed into the other. However, objects with holes in them can never
be transformed by stretching and deforming into objects without holes.

For example black hole can be described in terms of topology.

It means
that massive rotating body behave as a space-time hole. Wheeler supposed that
elementary particles, their spins, positive and negative charges can be presented
as interconnected black and white holes. Positron and electron pair correspond
to such model. The energy, directed to one of the hole, goes throw the connecting
tube -”handle” and reappears at the other.

The connecting tube exist in another space-time than holes itself. Such a
tube is undetectable in normal space and the process of energy transmission
looks as instantaneous. In conventional space-time two ends of tube, termed
’worm holes’ can be a vast distant apart. It gives an explanation of quantum
nonlocality. Like Bohm’s quantum potential, the Wheeler’s quantum topology
remains fascinating but unproved hypothesis.

The most serious attack on problem of quantum nonlocality was performed
by Roger Penrose (1989) from Oxford University with his twister theory of
space-time.

His ideas are quite close to those, developed in my dynamic wave-particle
duality model. For example, in accordance with Penrose, quantum phenomena
can generate space-time. The twisters, proposed by Penrose, are lines of inﬁnite
extent, resembling twisting light rays. Interception or conjunction of twistors

4

lead to origination of particles. In such a way the local and nonlocal properties
and particle-wave duality are interrelated in twistor geometry.

In our model the coherent triplets of standing neutrinos and antineutrinos,
representing fermions, could be resulted from free neutrino (or antineutrino)
strings interception with virtual [neutrino+antineutrino] pairs, represented by
symmetric bi-vacuum excitations (excited bi-vacuum bosons). Corresponding
vacuum symmetry breach is responsible for [mass–velocity-space-time] origina-
tion, pertinent only for Corpuscular [C] phase.

The analysis of main quantum paradoxes was presented by Asher Peres

(1992) and Charles Bennett et.al, (1993).

One of the most important question is related with possibility of existing of
hidden parameters. Searching of such parameters was strongly discouraged by
a theorem of Von Neumann (1955), claiming to show their to be unnecessary
for explanation the known quantum phenomena (see also N. Mermin, 1990).
Bohm proved his disagreement with formal statistical interpretation of quantum
theory and with conclusions of Von Neuman (Bohm & Hiley, 1993), concerning
nonexistence of hidden parameters.

We assume in our model that hidden (internal) parameters of elementary
particles are existing. In corpuscular phase they are interrelated in deﬁnite way
with external, experimentally detectable parameters.

Basic notions of new model

This work is devoted to analysis of the internal (hidden) param-
eters of elementary de Broglie waves termed waves B and their
interrelation with external, observable ones, in the framework of new
wave-particle duality model. The corpuscular [C] and the wave [W]
states are considered in our model as two alternative phase of wave
B, which are in dynamic equilibrium.

We discuss two possible interrelated model versions of elemen-
tary particles formation and their high frequency [C ⇋ W] pulsa-
tions. Each of them is based on consideration of positive and nega-
tive vacuum as two ”oceans’ of superﬂuid quantum liquid, composed
from virtual quanta of opposite energies. This interacting positive
and negative vacuum, termed BI-VACUUM, is composed from in-
ﬁnitive number of bi-vacuum bosons (BVB) in form of virtual
[rotor+antirotor] pairs. The resulting energy and momentum of
BVB at the conditions of their virtual spins equilibrium are equal
to zero due to their opposite direction of rotation in the energetic
planes of positive and negative vacuum. The dimensions of BVB are
determined by the values of opposite impulses of rotor and antirotor
in accordance with principle of uncertainty in coherent form. The
notion of bi-vacuum allows the dimensions of rotor and antirotor to
vary for many orders from each other as far their momentum and

5

energy compensate each other. Elementary and subelementary par-
ticles in their [C] and [W] phase may be considered as a result of
hierarchical self-organization of BVB in their symmetrical (ground)
and asymmetrical (excited) states.

The nonlocality of bi-vacuum bosons interaction is determined by
their zero resulting impulse, which determines the inﬁnitive virtual
wave B length and the inﬁnitive by scale PRIMORDIAL bi-vacuum
Bose condensation. The symmetric primordial bi-vacuum exists in
the total absence of matter and at the wave fronts, corresponding
to [W] phase of matter. The primordial bi-vacuum symmetry shift,
induced by presence of mater as a [C] phase of waves B, means orig-
ination of SECONDARY bi-vacuum, composed from BVB with very
small, but nonzero resulting impulses. It means the fragmentation
of the inﬁnitive bi-vacuum Bose condensate to huge, but ﬁnite bi-
vacuum domains. The dimensions of these domains are determined by
corresponding virtual de Broglie wave (wave B) length of bi-vacuum
bosons, composing them.

It is assumed that any kind of Bose condensate: real
or virtual one - has nonlocal properties, corresponding to
instant virtual signal transmission between particles, pul-
sating [C⇋W] in-phase. The signal transmission is medi-
ated by oscillation of energetic slit between ground states of
positive and negative vacuum (Vacuum Amplitude Waves -
”VAW”). Due to symmetry as respect to positive and negative vac-
uum the VAW and their interference are not related with impulse-
energy transmission. However, they may be responsible for storage
of information in form of corresponding standing waves, i.e. Infor-
mational ﬁeld origination in bi-vacuum.

The resulting impulse of bi-vacuum bosons (BVB), equal to zero in
[W] phase and very small in [C] phase, as well as corresponding virtual
wave B length - remain unchanged in a course of VAW excitation.

The BVB Bose condensate, produced by inﬁnitive number of pairs
[rotor+antirotor] of BVB, serves as a background for [C ⇋ W ] duality
realization, as will be shown below.

The virtual vortexes, rotors and BVB, as a components of sub-
elementary particles, introduced in our model, are the result of col-
lective excitations of virtual microparticles with similar angle velocity,
composing bi-vacuum as a quantum superﬂuid liquid.

In the ﬁrst model’s version it is assumed that just a neutrino,
antineutrino and their pairs are the primordial sub-elementary par-
ticles, building the elementary particles,
like electrons, positrons,
quarks, nucleons, etc. It is assumed that at certain conditions the
free neutrino turns to the standing one, leading to fusion of regular
elementary particles. This could happen when trajectories of free
neutrinos and antineutrinos (e, µ, τ ) change to the closed ones, cor-

6

responding to their standing waves length conditions. It may occur,
for example, in a course of strong vacuum symmetry ﬂuctuations,
accompanied by [origination ⇋ evaporation] of mini-black holes with
Plank’s parameters.

The spatial image of each standing neutrino in [C] phase as a
[real+mirror] mass dipole is asymmetric pair of [real vortex + mir-
ror rotor] with radiuses, determined by Compton length of real and
mirror masses. The realization of [C - W] duality is a consequence of
quantum beats between real [C+] and mirror [C−] corpuscular states,
accompanied by ejection of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC), repre-
senting [W] phase.

Spatial image of [W] phase in both model versions is a half of
parted hyperboloid, i.e. hyperbolic vortex in positive region of bi-
vacuum for particles and in negative - for antiparticles.

Bosons are considered as a coherent group, formed by the integer
number of pairs of fermions like standing [neutrino + antineutrino].
For example, it is proposed that photons are composed from three
such pairs.

The triplets of coherent standing neutrino (ν0) and antineutrino

(eν0) in ratio 2:1 and 1:2 - form the fermions: electron (2ν0 +eν0) and
the positron (ν0 + 2eν0) correspondingly. Such fermions, containing
one uncompensated (ν0) or (eν0) can originate also due to high-energy

photons ”splitting” under conditions of strong bi-vacuum symmetry
shift.

A new fundamental Coherent Neutrino/Antineutrino Interaction,
responsible for stabilization of elementary particles is introduced.
The exchange of virtual quanta in form of CVC between standing
neutrinos (sub-elementary particles) in a course their counterphase
[C ⇋ W ] pulsation, electromagnetic and gravitational interaction be-
tween sub-elementary particles - contribute to stabilization of ele-
mentary particles.

The u-quark is considered as a superposition of 2 positron- like
structures u ˜ [e++e+]u. The d-quark can be composed from two elec-
trons and one positron - like structures: d ˜ [2e−+1e+]d. Each of exces-
sive standing neutrino and antineutrino has an electric charge, equal
to +1/3 and -1/3 correspondingly.

In such a model the proton: p = [2u + d] contains more standing

composed from the equal number of standing neutrino and antineu-

antineutrino (12eν0) than neutrino (9ν0). The neutron: n = [d + 2u] is
trino (12ν0) and (12eν0). Each proton contains three excessive standing

antineutrinos with resulting spin and charge, opposite to that of the
electron.

In second version of model of wave B we do not use the
notions of standing neutrino and antineutrino as a sub-elementary
particles. The real and mirror mass origination is assumed to be a

7

result of BVB symmetry breach, accompanied by origination of the
same spatial images of [C] phase as the [real vortex + mirror rotor]
dipole and that of [W] phase, as the real hyperbolic vortex. For
sub-elementary particle real vortex is located in positive part of bi-
vacuum and mirror rotor in zero-point energetic plane of negative
part of bi-vacuum. For sub-elementary antiparticle, the situation is
opposite.

In this model version, in contrast to the ﬁrst one, elementary par-
ticles are secondary phenomena, resulted from bi-vacuum symmetry
certain violations.

Three generations of standing neutrino, electron and quark cor-
respond to three diﬀerent and stable values of energy slit between
rotor and antirotor of (BVB)e,µ,τ . Free neutrino of each generation
is deﬁned as the collective nonlocal excitation of corresponding kind
of BVB Bose condensate in form of (VAW)e,µ,τ .

The diﬀerence in two model versions does not inﬂuence the main

results of our theory.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF DUALITY MODEL

Corpuscle-Wave duality is supposed to be a result of high-
frequency oscillations (quantum beats) between the real and mirror
asymmetric states of particles.

In the course of [C ⇋ W] pulsations the part of real and mirror
corpuscular mass reversibly transforms to number of positive and neg-
ative virtual quanta, forming cumulative virtual cloud (CVC). This
virtual cloud corresponds to [W] - phase of particle and excites the
secondary virtual waves in bi-vacuum in accordance with Hugence
principle. The asymmetry of real and mirror mass-energy distri-
bution in bi-vacuum is a primary reason for electromagnetism and
gravitation in our model.

We consider each of standing neutrino or two other described
above bi-vacuum excitations, composing elementary particles in the
CORPUSCULAR [C] - phase as a Mass-Dipole, represented by real

(cid:0)m+
C(cid:1) and ”mirror”(cid:0)m−

tion of positive and negative vacuum sublevels. These masses can be
positive and negative in general case: (±m+
C ). However,
their product:

C(cid:1) masses, corresponding to correlated excita-

C ) and (±m−

(±m+

C) · (±m−

C) = m2

0 = const

(1)

is always positive and equal to the electron’s mass of rest (m0) squared.
In general case (m0)e,µ,τ is equal to mass of rest of µ and τ electrons.
The frequency and energy of quantum beats between positive and
negative vacuum in a course of [C ⇋ W] pulsations determine the

8

frequency and energy of wave B. It will be shown below, that at con-
ditions of Golden mean realization (22b) this frequency is determined
by (m0):

ωS = m0c2/ = 9.03 · 1020 s−1

(1a)

In accordance to relativist mechanics and (1), the real and mirror
masses - change with external group velocity (v ≡ vgr) of particles in
the counterphase manner:

C = ±m0/[1 − (v/c)2]1/2 and

It is possible after some reorganizations of (8) and using (5), to
get the formulae for the resulting (hidden) impulse of mass-dipole of
standing neutrino or that of rotor-dipole (9). The resulting impulses
of [C] and [W] phases are equal to each other and less than real
impulse of particle (9a), detectable in experiment.

From (4) we can ﬁnd out the diﬀerence between total energies of
real and mirror states of [C] phase. It is equal to energy of quantum
beats between these states, which determines the energy of wave B in

The cumulative virtual cloud (CVC), corresponding to the Wave
[W] phase, propagates in bi-vacuum with luminal velocity. The com-
ponent of CVC, corresponding to VDW, propagates in the positive
vacuum in the case of particles and in the negative vacuum in the
case of antiparticles. The velocity of propagation of particle in real
[C] phase is limited by particle’s external group velocity and can be
much lower than light velocity of CVC, corresponding to [W] phase. It
means that propagation of particle in space in a course of its [C ⇋ W ]
pulsation has a jump-way character. The energies of both phase are
equal and can be presented in a few forms:

of particle propagation in space may be responsible for spin.
This excited state of bi-vacuum is responsible also for real
mass and electric component of electromagnetic charge.

lation of virtual quanta in the ground energetic planes is re-
sponsible for magnetic properties of elementary particle in
accordance to our model. Such a rotor is a part of secondary
bi-vacuum bosons (BVB) as a pair [rotor+antirotor].

The [W] phase in form of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) origi-
nates as a result of quantum beats between real and mirror states of
[C] phase (see 12) of elementary wave B. Consequently, the spatial
image of CVC energy distribution can be considered as a geo-
metric diﬀerence between energetic surfaces of real [C+] state as an
equilateral hyperbola and that of [C−] state as a mirror circle. After
substraction of left and right parts of (15b and 15c) and some reor-
ganization, we get the energetic spatial image of [W ] phase or [CVC]

THE EXTERNAL AND HIDDEN PARAMETERS OF WAVE B.

HIDDEN HARMONY AND GOLDEN MEAN

Our model includes the notions of detectable in experiment - ex-

ternal and internal (hidden) parameters.

It postulates the equality of internal kinetic energies of real
and mirror corpuscular states. In accordance to introduced in our
theory deﬁnition of time (see eq. 61), this condition means that the
pace of time for both of these states is zero and their life-time is
inﬁnitive.

At the diﬀerent real and mirror masses (m+

C) such condi-
tion can be achieved by corresponding diﬀerence of hidden velocities
(v+

C >m−

in < v−

in):

(2T +

k )in = m+

C (v+

in)2 = m−

C (v−

in)2 = (2T −

k )in

(18)

It is easy to show that the internal kinetic energies are equal to

resulting one, determined by the mass of rest of the electron:

(T +

k )in = (T −

k )in = T0 =

1
2

m0 · c2

(18a)

The relativist increasing of m+

C with the
enhancement of external group velocity (v) is compensated by the
opposite change of hidden group and phase velocities, deﬁned as:

C and decreasing of m−

v+
in ≡ vin

gr and v−

in ≡ vin
ph

Like for external group (v) and phase (vph) velocities, the product
of internal velocities is equal to the light velocity squared:

vin
gr · vin

ph = v · vph = c2,

(18b)

however, in general case : vin

gr 6= v and vin

ph 6= vph

The resulting hidden impulse of sub-elementary wave B squared

is equal to

0 = P + · P − = (m+
P 2

C · vin

0 · c2 = const

(18c)

From (18) and (4) we get the important relation between the in-

ternal and external velocities:

Taking into account (18b), formula (19) can be transformed to:

vph(cid:19)(cid:21)1/2

(19)

(20)

In more convenient for us shape the above formula looks like:

c

gr

=

[1 − (v/c)2]1/4

We introduce the important condition of Hidden Harmony:
the equality of internal (hidden) and external group and
phase velocities:

(21)

gr= vext
gr

(cid:2)vin

and vin

ph= vext

ph(cid:3)

Realization of this primary condition determines the value of Golden

mean, as a deﬁnite ratio of group and phase velocities (internal and
external):

S =

=(cid:20) v

=(cid:18) v2

(21a)

Using (21a), we get from (20) the simple quadratic equation:

S2 + S − 1 = 0

or :

S

(1 − S)1/2 = 1

(22)

(22a)

The positive solution of (22) gives the numerical value of Golden

mean:

S ≡ P hi = (A/B) = 0.618

(23)

Golden mean is one of the most intriguing, important and universal
number of Nature. Lot of very diﬀerent natural phenomena - from
ratio of parameters of planetary orbits to the law of multiplication
of microbes and rabbits (Fibonacci row ) follow Golden mean. Our
intuitive perception of beauty and harmony also is related to Golden
mean. However, in contrast to number (π), it origin was entirely
obscure.

The deep quantum roots of Golden mean, reﬂecting realization of
conditions of Hidden Harmony (21), leading from our dynamic model
of wave-particle duality, explain the universality of this number (S =
0.618).

We put forward a hypothesis, that any kind of selected system,
enable to self-assembly, self-organization and evolution: from atoms
to living organisms, galactics and the Universe - are tending to con-
ditions of Hidden Harmony as a background of Golden Mean real-
ization. The less is deviation of ratio of characteristic parameters
of system from [S ≡ P hi], the more advanced is evolution of this
system.

18

We have to keep in mind that all forms of matter are composed

from hierarchic system of de Broglie waves.

Our statement that tendency of any system (from elementary
particle to the Universe) to Hidden Harmony is a driving force and
ﬁnal goal of evolution - can be conﬁrmed on the lot of examples.
One of them is evaluation of energy of wave B (i.e. electron), corre-
sponding to Golden mean condition.

The formula (4) at condition (c/v)2 = S, taking into account (22a),
can be easily driven to the following expression, meaning the equality
of mass symmetry shift, produced by particle (∆mS
C ) to mass of rest
of this particle (m0):

∆mS

C = (m+

C − m−

C )S = m+

C · S =

m0 · S

(1 − S)1/2 = m0

(23b)

The energy of wave B, equal to that of CVC, at condition of Hidden

harmony and Golden mean, is equal to:

ES

B = ∆mS

C · c2 = m0 · c2 = m0 · vgrvph = ω0 = Tk + V

(24)

where the angle frequency of [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of ”ideal” electron
with external and internal group velocities, determined by condition
(21) is equal to:

ω0 = m0c2/ = 9.03 · 1020 s−1

We can see, that at condition of Hidden Harmony, the total energy
of wave B is described by Einstein’s formula, unifying the energy and
mass. This means that each cycle of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation is accompanied
by reversible annihilation of each of standing neutrino (elementary
wave B), composing elementary particles.

From the known relation between kinetic (Tk) and potential (V ) energy

of wave B and that of group and phase velocities (14b), at the con-
dition of Golden mean: S = [vgr/vph]ext = [vgr/vph]in , we get the ratios
between diﬀerent energy contributions of wave B:

Tk(cid:21)S
(cid:20) V

=

2
S

− 1 = 2.236

or S =(cid:20) 2Tk
EB(cid:21)S

= 0.618

(25)

We may introduce here the ”Dead mean” conditions, correspond-
ing to thermal equilibrium. At this conditions any system represents
the number of independent oscillators, unable, consequently to self-
organization:

Tk(cid:21)D
(cid:20) V

= 1

EB(cid:21)D
(cid:20) 2Tk

EB (cid:21)D
=(cid:20) Tk + V

= 1

(25a)

19

In section: ”Electromagnetism” the important results will be pre-

sented, pointing that principles of hydrogen and other atoms/molecules
assembly follow the rule of Golden mean, based on Hidden harmony.
It is shown also that the famous Sri Yantra diagram contains the

features, compatible with our model of duality.

Scenario of free asymmetric particle (fermions) propagation

in vacuum in a course of its [C ⇋ W ] pulsation

For the end of simpliﬁcation we consider the behavior of sub-
elementary particle, like a single standing neutrino with △mC = (m+
C −
m−
C ) > 0 in Corpuscular [C] phase. Such standing neutrino can exist,
in accordance to our model, only in composition of triplets, like the

electron [2ν0 +eν0].

We can subdivide the process of this particle dynamics in a course

2. The [C] phase is unstable due to its speciﬁc asymmetric compo-
sition from elements of positive and negative vacuum: [real+mirror]
mass - dipole, corresponding to spatial image of pair of [real vor-
tex+ mirror rotor] dipole. This instability is a ”driving force”
of [C ⇋ W] pulsations in form of quantum beats between real and
mirror states.

There are three interrelated consequences of the ﬁrst semiperiod
of these pulsations, corresponding to transition from Corpuscular to
the Wave phase:

a) The excessive energy of real corpuscular state [C+] as respect
to mirror one [C−] of corpuscular phase - turns to the energy of
cumulative virtual cloud (CVC), corresponding to that of the [W]
phase. The CVC propagates in bi-vacuum with light velocity. The

20

energy of CVC can be subdivided to energy of Vacuum Density Waves
(VDW) and Vacuum Symmetry Waves (VSW):

EW = (m+

C − m−

C · v2 = EC
or : ECV C = EV DW + EV SW = EW

C ) · c2 = m+

(28)

(28a)

where : EV DW =(cid:12)(cid:12)m+

C − m0(cid:12)(cid:12) · c2; EV SW =(cid:12)(cid:12)m−

C − m0(cid:12)(cid:12) · c2

The hidden resulting impulse of CVC, composed from these two
CV C ), determines the resulting radius of

kinds of virtual quanta (P ±
CVC (L±

CV C ), equal to that of corpuscular mass-dipole:

CV C = c(m+
P ±

C − m−

C ) = c△mC and L±

CV C =



(m+

C − m−

C ) · c

(29)

The spatial image of CVC is a half of two-cavity parted hyper-
boloid (see eq. 16 and Fig.2), each of cavity, corresponding to positive
for particles and negative for antiparticles components of CVC.

The resulting energy and the external impulse of secondary bi-

vacuum boson (BVB) - turns to zero:

EBV B =

0 ) · c2 → 0

(m+

0 ) · c → 0 λBV B = h/PBV B → ∞.

(30)

(31)

The radius of BVB, with spatial image of pair of 2D rotors, is
determined by the electron’s Compton radius, equal to that of CVC
at condition of Hidden harmony (21): LBV B = /m0c

The conditions (31) means that the bi-vacuum bosons (BVB), cor-
responding to [W] phase of coherently pulsating particles, may form
nonlocal virtual Bose condensate with inﬁnitive dimensions.

The secondary curved bi-vacuum, corresponding to [C] phase, dis-
plays nonlocality only in the volume of ﬁnite, but huge clusters in
contrast to unperturbed ﬂat primordial bi-vacuum, which nonlocal-
ity has no limitations.

The probability of BVB origination and their Bose condensation

is very high for both: primordial and secondary vacuum.

3. At the next, the reverse stage of our scenario, the ”ejected” in a
course of [C → W] transition cumulative virtual cloud (CVC), repre-
senting [W] phase of particle - restores in bi-vacuum the asymmetric
[real-mirror] mass dipole (C-phase) in form of [real vortex+mirror
rotor] pair as a result of CVC absorption by one of BVB.

The most probable distance of restoration of [C] phase, i.e. [W →
C] transition - from the point of previous [C → W] transition is de-
termined by the external wave B length of the electron (27a).

21

The in-phase [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of symmetric pair of standing

neutrino and antineutrino [ν0 + eν0] in composition of the electron
[2ν0 +eν0] is also accompanied by [ejection ⇋ absorption] of twin CVC

in form of parted hyperboloid (Fig. 2). These correlated CVC of
positive and negative vacuum - totally compensate each other and do
not contribute to the impulse - energy of uncompensated standing
neutrino of triplet. However, the periodic [emission ⇋ absorption] of
CVC doublet may generate the nonlocal (instant) Vacuum Amplitude
Waves (VAW), as oscillations of bi-vacuum zero-point energy slit.

Our model do not needs the Bohmian ”quantum potential” or
”pilot wave” for explanation of two-slit experiment. For the com-
mon case of ensembles of particles, the explanation can be based on
interference of their [W] phase in form of cumulative virtual clouds
(CVC). The ability of CVC to activate secondary virtual waves and
wavefronts in bi-vacuum could be responsible for interference, pro-
duced even by single electron or photon. Scattering of photons on
the free electrons will aﬀect their impulse, mass, wave B length and,
consequently, the interference picture. Only [C] phase of particle, but
not its [W] phase can be registered by detectors of particles. Such a
consequences of our dynamic duality model can explain all details of
well known and still mysterious double slit experiment.

The absence of dissipation in the process of [C ⇋ W ] transitions
in bi-vacuum Bose condensate as in superﬂuid quantum liquid, makes
them totally reversible.

Propagation of fermion in 3D space in a course of its [C ⇋ W ]
pulsation can be considered as a periodic jumping of particle in form
of CVC of [W] phase with light velocity between wavefronts of bi-
vacuum, corresponding to [C] phase, moving with group velocity
lower than luminal one. The wavefronts of [C] and [W] phase are
normal as respect to direction of particles propagation.

The separation between coherent wavefronts, generated by real [C]

phase, is determined by real external wave B length (eq.27a).

The energy (ECV C ) of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) is deter-
C −
C ) · c2 in a course of [C ⇋ W ] and energy of secondary bi-vacuum

mined by diﬀerence in energy of quantum beats: ∆mC · c2 = (m+
m−
symmetry shift (∆mV · c2):

ECV C = (∆mC − ∆mV ) · c2

(32)

The total energy of wave B is a sum of CVC energy and energy of

vacuum symmetry shift:

EB = ECV C + ∆mV · c2 = ∆mC · c2

(33)

The nonlocal quantum interaction can occur between [C] phase
particles via secondary bi-vacuum Bose condensate. The nonlocal

22

interaction between [C] phase of particles in the huge but limited
volume of secondary bi-vacuum Bose condensate, may be realized as
a coherent change of vacuum symmetry shift:

∆mV =

0 − m−

V − m−

(34)

0(cid:12)(cid:12) =(cid:12)(cid:12)m+

V(cid:12)(cid:12)

in the shell of secondary superﬂuid Bi-vacuum Bose condensate

with the radius of curvature:

LBV C = /(∆mV · c)

(34a)

The vacuum symmetry shift oscillation may be induced by the
mass symmetry shift (∆mC ) oscillation, resulted from change of ve-
locity in a coherent system of particles and in-phase [C ⇋ W ] pulsation
(see ”Gravitation”):

∆mC =(cid:12)(cid:12)m+

C − m−

C(cid:12)(cid:12) ˜ ∆mV

Such kind of nonlocal interaction display itself in oscillation of

LBV C .(34a), i.e. radius of nonlocality.

The oscillation of real mass of uncompensated standing neutrino
(ν0) of elementary particle due to its alternating acceleration - is ac-

companied by corresponding oscillations of real masses of pair [ν0 +eν0]
in composition of the electrons [2ν0 +eν0], protons and neutrons. These
symmetric oscillation of [ν0 +eν0], in turn, excite the nonlocal Vacuum

Amplitude Waves (VAW), accompanied by oscillations of bi-vacuum
Bose condensate (BC) energy slit (EBV B), equal to that of BVB:

EBV B + ∆EBV B =

[(m+

0 + ∆m+

AV AW = ∆EBV B = ∆m+

0 + ∆m−

0 = ∆m±
0

(34b)

(34c)

(34d)

Such mechanism of nonlocal interaction via virtual BC can explain
the instant interaction between coherent twin photons in experiments
of Aspect et all and realization of principle of least action.

Our theory relates the pace of time for any selected closed system
to the pace of the external real kinetic energy Tkin change (see below).
The notion of real time is existing only on realm of wave-
fronts, corresponding to [C] phase of wave B. The pace of
real time is determined by the pace of real kinetic energy
change. At the [W] wavefronts and bi-vacuum energetic
surface, the notion of real time is absent as far the notion
of real kinetic energy is absent. However, the virtual time could
coexist with change of virtual kinetic energy.

23

Spatial stability of complex systems: atoms, molecules and that
of solids means that in these systems superposition of asymmetrical
cumulative virtual clouds, representing [W] states of elementary par-
ticles - forms hologram - like 3D standing waves superposition with
location of nodes, corresponding to the most probable positions of
corpuscular phase of the nucleons, electrons, atoms and molecules in
condensed matter. The binding of CVC by bi-vacuum bosons restore
the [C] phase of particles in positions, close to the most probable ones
in accordance with the value of corresponding wave function squared
(see below).

ELECTROMAGNETISM

The ﬁne structure constant (α = 7.29735 · 10−3) in our model can be
related to ratio of minimum zero-point external group velocity of the
electron (v = v0), to the light velocity as follows:

α =

e2
c

c (cid:17)2
=(cid:16) v0

(i·η) =(cid:0)iin·ηin(cid:1) = e2

(35)

(36)

The new notions of external and internal (hidden) electric
(i; iin) and magnetic (η; ηin) components of resulting electromagnetic
charge (e) are interrelated with each other as

In accordance to our theory, the real and mirror states of [vor-
tex+rotor] dipole of [C] phase - reﬂect the internal electric (iin) and
magnetic (ηin) components of electromagnetic charge, correspond-
ingly.

It may be shown, that the ratio of Bohr magneton (µB) to internal

magnetic moment of the electron (µη):

µB = e · (/2m0c);

µin
η = ηin·(/2m0 c)

(37)

charge (ηin).

The electromagnetic energy, corresponding to maximum poten-
tial of the electron, is expressed in our model as an internal interaction
energy between elementary internal electric (iin) and magnetic (ηin)
charges, separated by the radius (L±) of [real+mirror] mass-dipole.
This value is equal to radius of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC), pro-
duced by quantum beats between real and mirror states of the elec-

tron’s (2ν0 +eν0) uncompensated standing neutrino (ν0):

squared; v is the external group velocity of particle in [C] state.

The total electromagnetic potential of proton with positive charge,
determined by fractional charges of three uncompensated antineutri-
nos of three quarks, is equal to that of the electron, but with opposite
sign. It can be expressed in similar way:

dimensions, equal to radius of their CVC, should be equal to each
other:

As far the mass of proton is much bigger, than that of the electron:

As far the Compton radius is in fact experimental parameter, ob-
tained from analysis of scattering of photons on the electrons, we may
conclude, that the Nature follows the principle of Hidden harmony
or Golden mean, indeed.

The Compton radius of the electron is an averaged value of the
real internal real (L+) vortex and mirror (L−) rotor radiuses, as it

we ﬁnd out that the internal mechanic moment of the electron in

Two possible projections of momentum of real vortex of [C+] state
in form of paraboloid of revolution, for particles and antiparticles
to selected direction, determines the sign of spin of fermions, like
electron or positron.

The total electromagnetic energy of the electron (Eel) can be con-
sidered as a part of total energy of wave B, equal to that of cumula-
tive virtual cloud (CVC), determined by the ﬁne structure constant
(α = e2/c) as a factor. This means that the notion of the electric and
magnetic components of virtual quanta, responsible for interaction
between charged particles, looks to be pertinent for the wave [W]
phase of particle only. However, the electric and magnetic compo-
nents of charge are related to [real vortex + mirror rotor] dipole of
corpuscular [C] phase, correspondingly.

The notions of spin, real mass and time also are pertinent only for

[C] phase of particle only.

THE HYDROGEN ATOM

One more evidence in proof of our model is that the Bohr radius
of the Hydrogen atom is equal to radius of CVC of the electron and
proton, at conditions of Golden mean [L0 = (L±)S at (m+
C ) = m0]:

C − m−

aB =



α

(44b)

Corresponding condition of the electron’s standing wave with the

electron’s group velocity on the orbit, equal to: v = αc is:

λB = 2π · aB =

h

m0(αc)

(44c)

27

One can see from (44c), that the Bohr radius can be expressed also
via total electromagnetic energy of the electron in ”ideal condition”
(eq.44a) as:

aB =

c
ES
el

=

Q2
ES
el

where Q2 = c is a total charge of the electron, squared, related to

the total energy of CVC (see 42).

The energy of electrostatic attraction between electron and proton
at the hydrogen atom, compensated in Bohr’s model by energy of
centripetal energy, is proportional to the total electromagnetic energy
of the electron at condition of hidden harmony:

EH =

e2
aB

= α ·

e2
L0

= α2 · m0c2 = α · ES

(44d)

The biggest part of energy of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC =
[vacuum density + vacuum symmetry waves] ≡ VDW + VSW), re-
sulted from quantum beats of the electron’s unpaired standing neu-
trino, is nonparticipating in electromagnetism and is responsible for
realization of [C ⇋ W ] duality and stabilization of elementary parti-
cles. The part of energy of CVC of [W] phase of particle is charac-
terized by radius: L0 = /m0c = α · aB.

The radius of component of CVC, responsible for interaction be-

tween electron and proton, is equal to the Bohr radius (44b).

The part of CVC, nonparticipating in electromagnetism may be
responsible for coherent exchange interaction between two standing

phase [C ⇋ W ] pulsation. The energy of this part is equal to:

neutrinos of the electron [2ν0 +eν0] with opposite spins and counter-

CV C = (EV DW + EV SW ) − α (EV DW + EV SW ) = (EV DW + EV SW ) · (1 − α)
(45)

EW

where: Emax

el = α · (EV DW + EV SW ) ≪ EV DW + EV SW

The energy of vacuum density waves is EV DW =(cid:12)(cid:12)m+
the energy of vacuum symmetry waves is: EV SW =(cid:12)(cid:12)m−

here, is the invariant:

C − m0(cid:12)(cid:12) · c2 and
C − m0(cid:12)(cid:12) · c2

dtot = (m+

Using (13), the quantization rule for electromagnetic energy (42)

can be expressed as:

(47)

28

At the Hidden harmony/Golden mean condition, we have for the

electron’s frequency of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation:

ω0 = [ω+

and

C − m−

C(cid:12)(cid:12)P

(m0)P

From this formula one can see that the electromagnetic energy
emergence is a result of quantum beats between real and mirror cor-
puscular states of one uncompensated [vortex+rotor] dipole of the
electron and three of them in proton’s quarks with fractional charge
(+ 1

3 ).
The formula (47) and our presentation of elementary wave B as
a dynamic system of [real vortex+mirror rotor] dipole get support
from the known expression of vector analysis (48). We can express
the divergency of Pointing vector: P = (c/4π)[EH] via diﬀerence of
contributions, related to real and mirror rotors:

div[EH] =

4π
c

divP = HrotE − ErotH

(48)

where H and E are the magnetic and electric components of virtual
photons, radiated by electron in course of quantum beats between real
and mirror phase of uncompensated bi-vacuum excitation in a course
of its [C ⇋ W ] pulsation.

The analogy between (47) and (48), illustrating the dynamic [vor-

tex+rotor] dipole background of (47), is evident.

THE MECHANISM OF ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERACTION

In accordance to model, the mechanism of electromagnetic re-
pulsion and attraction between charged particles is a result of re-
alization of principle of least action in our formulation. It means
tendency of system to minimum of resulting density of energy of
cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) (see eq.60), interrelated with vac-

uum symmetry shift (∆mV = (cid:12)(cid:12)m+
(∆mC =(cid:12)(cid:12)m+

C(cid:12)(cid:12)) as one can see from eq. 52.

The repulsion is a consequence of streaming of two particle with
similar charge to increase the distance between them, as far it mini-
mize the density of energy of CVC of the same sign . The electromag-
netic attraction is a consequence the same principle, because of two
CVC of the opposite energy are tending to compensate the inﬂuence

V(cid:12)(cid:12)) and mass symmetry shift

V − m−

C − m−

29

of each other, decreasing the resulting energy of CVC as a cluster
of virtual photons. The closer are opposite charges to each other, the
more symmetric becomes energy distribution and resulting vacuum
and mass symmetry shift.

In the case of the electron and positron scattering, their oppo-
site by energy cumulative virtual clouds: CVC− and CVC+ - trans-
form to the high energy photon structure after overlapping, leading
to annihilation of e− and e+. The energy of such photon is:

hνph = [(m+

C − m−

C )e+ ]c2

C − m−

C )e− + (m+

At the Golden mean condition this formula change to:

hνph = 2m0c2

In general case the energy of photon as a result of annihilation:

[e− + e+] → [(2ν0 +eν0) + (2eν0 + ν0)] can be more than 2m0c2, depending on

velocity of their colliding. If the energy of photon is more than 2m0c2,
it can split to [electron+positron] pair again at certain conditions.

Alternative Corpuscle-Wave model of atom

Besides planetary model of hydrogen atom of Bohr-Sommerfeld,
our duality approach allows to propose the new one It is assumed
that [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of the electrons and nuclear of atom are
in-phase.

We suppose also, that the electrons in the [C] phase has an ability
for limited jumps along line tangent to orbit around the nuclear.
The length of one jump (l0) is determined by period of the electron
[C ⇋ W ] pulsation: T0 = 2π·ω0 (47a) and its external group velocity
(v = αc):

llb = T0 · v = α

h

m0c

= αL0

(48a)

This real [C] - jump of the electron is much smaller than the length
of Bohr’s orbit (44c). Their ratio is equal to ﬁne structure constant
squared:

llb/ (2πaB) = α2

(48b)

The stage of the electron-proton interaction, corresponding to [W]
phase of atom, represents a superposition of part of their CVC with
equal wave B length, determined by Bohr radius (44b) in form of
virtual 3D standing wave. Such 3D standing wave, reﬂecting [W]

30

phase of atom is not dissipating. It is formed by compensating each
other virtual photons of opposite energy. The total absolute value of
such energy of electromagnetic interaction in Hydrogen atom is:

EH

el = 2α2 · m0c2

(48c)

At the following semiperiod the atom returns to its [C] phase
and the electron makes its next corpuscular jump around nuclear.
As far the real time in virtual [W] phase is absent (see section: ”The
principle of least action and problem of time”), this phase is out of
perception and it looks that the electron in [C] phase is in the process
of permanent rotation along the orbit.

The density of charge is oscillating in a course of [W ⇋ C] pulsa-
tions of the [electron+proton] and its movement around nuclear. It
means that the interpretation of Van-der-Waals interaction as a re-
sult of coherently ﬂickering charge of atoms/molecules remains valid
in our model.

In atoms, containing one or integer number of the electrons pairs
with opposite spins of the electrons, their counterphase [C-W] cy-
cles of each selected [electron+proton] pair - are accompanied by 3D
standing waves formation, which are more symmetric and stable, than
in atoms with unpaired valent electrons.

Uniﬁcation of atoms in a course of diﬀerent reactions, accompanied
by uniﬁcation of unpaired valent electrons and creation of additional
symmetric standing waves B, is energetically favorable. Molecules
could be considered as a highly orchestrated dynamic systems, where
the [W ⇋ C] pulsations of all protons, neutrons and electrons are
coherent with frequency (47a), corresponding to Hidden harmony
condition for the electron.

New interpretation of Coulomb interaction between macroscopic

bodies.

The spinning eﬀect

Let us proceed from assumption, that the interaction (attraction
or repulsion) between charged macroscopic bodies is a result of aver-
aging of their electromagnetic potentials (EC = (E1 · E2)2, depending
on their average charge, squared (q2
1,2) and the distance between cen-
ters of bodies (r1,2):

q2
1,2 = ±(q1 · q2)
r1 = r2 = r1,2

Consequently, the Coulomb interaction between these bodies, tak-

ing into account dielectric permeability (ε), can be expressed as:

EC = −

total charges of two bodies in terms of our model:

try shift of elementary charge (∆mC ) is related to its kinetic energy as:

velocity of elementary charges, depending on their coherent thermal
oscillations and relative macroscopic movement of two bodies, with-
out the change of distance between centrums of their mass (r1,2). The

32

simplest kind of such movement is the relative spinning/rotation of
bodies.

The biggest contribution of resulting kinetic energy to (49d) is
mostly due to in-phase microscopic atomic/molecular oscillations in
the volume of coherent clusters, resulting from high-temperature
Bose condensation, in accordance to our Hierarchic theory of con-
densed matter (see: www.egroups.com/docvault/antigrav). This con-
tribution depends on temperature and the external ﬁelds tension,
aﬀecting the dynamics of lattice of bodies.

Substitution of 49c or 49d to 48d, will lead to eq.49e, unifying our

approach and Coulomb interaction.

Taking into account that q2

1,2 = n2e2 (n is the integer number) and

α = e2/c, this formula can be driven to:

(∆m1,2 · c/)x,y,z is a resulting for system of two bodies the Compton’s
wave number tensor, determined by the sum of their uncompensated

At the conditions of Golden mean, when: (cid:12)(cid:12)m+

m1 = N1m0; ∆m2 = N2m0 and ∆m1,2 = m0(N1N2)1/2, where N1 and
N2 are the numbers of uncompensated elementary charges in the ﬁrst
and second bodies, correspondingly.

C(cid:12)(cid:12) = m0 we have:

C − m=

For the case of isotropic dielectric permeability, we get from 49b:

[n2/(−→r ε)]3 = (c/)3 · (∆m1,2)x · (∆m1,2)y · (∆m1,2)z = const

(49f)

For Newtonian gravitation we get the similar formulae, replac-
ing α to β = (m0/MP l)2. This phenomena, responsible for electro-
gravitational interaction, will be discussed at the next section.

Using again relation between (49c) and (49d), we get from (49f ):

[n2/(−→r ε)]3 = c/3 · (mv2

These formulae leads to important conclusion: the increasing of

mal to (z, parallel to −→r ) will be accompanied by relativist enhance-
ment of product [(∆m1,2)x · (∆m1,2)y] ˜ [(mv2

sponding decreasing of (∆m1,2)z and (mv2

The analogy is existing between the ”polaron” - quantum excita-

matter represents the mobile pair with dipole properties [electron +
lattice polarization]. For the other hand, the standing neutrino of el-
ementary particle in [C] phase we consider as a ”mass - dipole” with
resulting charge (△mC), coexisting with vacuum polarization, termed
in our model - bi-vacuum symmetry shift (△mV ).

The mass and mobility of system: [(C-phase) + vacuum symmetry

shift] depends on the absolute value of vacuum polarization: △mV .

THE MECHANISM OF GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION

36

It can be similar to hydrodynamic Bjorkness interaction between
pulsing particles in liquids, radiating acoustic waves. We suppose
that gravitational waves, resulted from quantum beats between pos-
itive and negative ground states of vacuum, decreasing the vacuum
symmetry shift, are decreasing also the virtual quanta pressure be-
tween particles more than outside of them. This leads to excessive
outside vacuum pressure, providing the gravitational attraction be-
tween bodies.

In accordance with the existing theory of Bjorkness force, it is
dependent on distance between pulsing bodies or microbubbles in
liquid - as (1/r2).

It is important that this force could be positive and negative, de-
pending on diﬀerence of phase of pulsations, generating density waves.
In turn, this phase shift is dependent on relation of distance between
bodies to acoustic (or gravitational in our case) wave length. If the
length of acoustic (gravitational) waves, excited by bodies, is less or
comparable with the distance between bodies, the Bjorkness (gravi-
tational) force is attractive. If the distance is much bigger than wave
length, then the attraction of bodies turns to repulsion. This mean
origination of antigravitation.

The large-scale honey-comb structure of the Universe, its huge
voids, could be explained by the interplay of gravitational attraction
and repulsion between clusters of galactics, depending on the distance
between them.

Recently a strong evidence appears, pointing to acceleration of the
Universe expansion. This phenomena could be explained by increas-
ing the antigravitation factor with increasing the distance between
galactics. This conﬁrms our hydrodynamic model of mechanism of
gravitation.

Like electromagnetic interaction, the gravitational one can be con-
sidered as a result of principle of least action realization (see eq. 60).
For this end we have to assume, that the resulting vacuum symmetry
shift, represented by sum of contributions of (∆mV ) between bodies
and outside of them - decreases with decreasing the distance between
them.

For the other hand, if the starting separation between bodies (L)

is big enough:.

L >LBV C = /[∆mV · c]

(55c)

then the increasing of this separation minimize the resulting vac-

uum symmetry shift, i.e. we have a gravitational repulsion.

The gravitational interaction is related to the very low-energy vir-
tual quanta pressure oscillation between positive and negative zero-
point vacuum, which may be termed as under-zero-point virtual
quanta (- 1
ω0), in contrast to virtual quanta with

energy, bigger than absolute value of zero-point energy: (cid:12)(cid:12)± 1

Consequently, the GW represents the density/pressure oscillations
of the under zero-point virtual quanta, excited as a consequence of
beats between positive and negative vacuum states, formed by bi-
vacuum bosons Bose condensate. In another terms, GW can be con-
sidered as a result of interference between vacuum symmetry waves
(VSW+ and VSW−). In the framework of our model there are no
evidence, pointing to luminal limitation of gravitational waves prop-
agation.

It contrast to gravitational ﬁeld, the electromagnetic ﬁeld is a
result of quasi-real vacuum density waves (VDW) interference, enable
to impulse and energy transmission.

tational (49) energies, we get the relation between them:

The interrelation with general theory of relativity

It is possible to demonstrate a relation between Einstein’s idea
concerning curving the geometry of space in the presence of gravitat-
ing body and our vacuum symmetry shift parameter:

∆mV =(cid:12)(cid:12)m+

V − m−

C − m−

V(cid:12)(cid:12) = β(cid:12)(cid:12)m+

C(cid:12)(cid:12)

Einstein postulates that gravitation changes the trajectory of probe body
from the right to geodesic one due to curving conventional two-dimensional sur-
face in 3D space. For example, trajectories of planets round the sun corresponds
to geodesic lines.

(57)

38

Instead Euclid geometry on ﬂat surface, the Lobachevsky geometry on curved
surface was used in Einstein’s classic theory of gravitation. The criteria of sur-
face curvature for sphere - is a diﬀerence between sum of angles in triangle on
the ﬂat surface equal to π = 1800, and that on curved surface:

Σ = π + S/R2

where: S is a square of triangle (πR2 on the ﬂat surface); R is a sphere radius,
or a curvature radius in general case:

R =r S

Σ − π

when (Σ − π) > 0, the curvature (R > 0) is positive; when (Σ − π) < 0, the

(surface) is ﬂat, then R = ∞ and Σ = π = 1800.

In our Wave - Corpuscle Duality Model of Gravitation instead
space-time curvature R we introduce a Bi-Vacuum Symmetry Cur-
vature, deﬁned as:

±Lvac = ±

(57b)

where: ±∆mV = ±((cid:12)(cid:12)m+

symmetry shift.

V(cid:12)(cid:12)) = ±β∆mC is a vacuum symmetry shift,

V(cid:12)(cid:12) −(cid:12)(cid:12)m−

It is possible to calculate, using (2.9) that vacuum curvature, in-
duced by particle with mass, equal to that of the electron (me =
9.1095 · 10−31kg)

V = 3.2288 · 1035m.

For the particle with mass of proton (mP = 1.6726·10−27kg) we have:

Energy of gravitational ﬁeld, produced by one proton, calculated

G = 8.8904 · 10−52J.

from (2.9) is equal to: ǫP
The analogy between R and Lvac (2.26 and 2.27) is obvious. The more is
energy of gravitational ﬁeld ǫG, the more is vacuum symmetry shift (∆mV )
and bi-vacuum curvature. The bigger is bi-vacuum curvature, the less is radius
(Lvac).
In condition of black hole origination, when ∆mV → βMP l the bi-vacuum
curvature radius tends to that, determined by gravitational radius (rg) of black
hole and Plank length (see 55b):

L∗

Vac =

(57c)

On the other hand, in the absence of gravitation, when the positive and negative
vacuum ground states are in state of ideal symmetry and equilibrium:

V |=

m0 =

(57d)

and ∆mV = 0, then the bi-vacuum is ﬂat: LVac = ∞ .

The photons trajectory reﬂects the bi-vacuum curvature in 3D
space. It is a consequence of our model of photon as a superposition
of three pairs of coherent standing [neutrino + antineutrino], moving
in bi-vacuum without its symmetry perturbation.

The trajectory of photon follows the bi-vacuum Bose condensate radius and
in general case deviate from the straight line, corresponding to ”ﬂat” primordial
bi-vacuum in the absence of matter. Near the black holes it turns to the closed
one as a result of corresponding bi-vacuum symmetry violation.

As well as General theory of relativity our theory can explain the
red shift of photons in gravitational ﬁeld. The RED, low-frequency
shift:

∆ω1,2

p = ω(1)

p − ω(2)
p

(57e)

of photons in gravitation ﬁeld is a result of deviation of their trajec-
tory from the right line and is a consequence of increasing the vacuum
symmetry curvature and corresponding length of its path.

In accordance to our model, red shift has a simple relation with
diﬀerence of vacuum symmetry shifts at point of photon radiation

(57f)

It is easy to see that if ∆∆m1,2

p and red shift is absent.

V = 0 , i.e. bi-vacuum is ﬂat, then

We may conclude, that our Duality Model of Gravitation ex-
plains the same phenomena, as do the General theory of relativ-
ity, but in terms of vacuum symmetry shift with tensor properties,
instead of curved space-time. The tensor properties of bi-vacuum
symmetry shift is related directly to that of mass symmetry shift:
(∆mV = β∆mC )x,y,z, produced by asymmetry of relativist real mass
dependence on the external group velocity in 3D space.

The masses of each body are the result of all elementary parti-
cles mass summation. In the Golden mean conditions, as was shown

earlier: (cid:12)(cid:12)m+

C(cid:12)(cid:12)e,p,n = (m0)e,p,n . It looks, that the existing of such

invariant as Avogadro number - conﬁrms our hypothesis, that the ele-
mentary particles in composition of atoms and molecules and atoms/molecules
itself in any phase of matter are tending to certain ratio (25), provid-
ing realization of Hidden harmony condition (21), as a background of
Golden mean rule (21a).

For the averaged mass, squared, we get from 58b:

(58c)

If we assume that (m2

P l, (58c) may be transformed to important formula, meaning

1,2/m2

G = c/M 2

41

that the resulting volume in 3D energetic space is permanent:

C )1,2 · v2

(58d)

One can see from this formula that if due to any external fac-
tors (electric or magnetic ﬁelds, relative rotation of interacting bod-
ies, etc., the value of (∆m1,2 · c2)2
is increasing,
the ”vertical” component of gravitational interaction (∆m1,2 · c2)z =
should decrease. Such eﬀect corresponds to decreasing

of gravitational attraction between bodies.

In the case of charged condensers, the mechanism described,
may be responsible for Biefeld-Brown eﬀect. The explanation of
this eﬀect is related to polarization of charge and mass of dielec-
tric molecules in electric ﬁeld in such a way, that massive positive
nuclears are shifted towards negative plate of condenser and their
oscillations become more unharmonic and asymmetric in 3D space.
In accordance to our Hierarchic theory of condensed matter, signif-
icant fraction of atoms/molecules in solids are composition of co-
herent clusters, formed as a result of high-temperature Bose con-
densation (see my: ”Hierarchic theory of condensed matter...” at:
www.egroup.com/docvault/antigrav) This is important factor, mak-
ing the inﬂuence of external ﬁeld on the atoms/molecules charge and
mass polarization - cumulative. Correspondingly, the virial coeﬃ-
cient, equal to ratio between the resulting doubled kinetic and po-
tential energy of coherent fraction of positively charged nuclears
of dielectric between plates, as a tensor, becomes also more asym-
metric. For the other hand, in accordance to this theory, between
tensors of mass symmetry shift, responsible for electromagnetism,
and tensor of vacuum symmetry shift, responsible for gravitation, -
the direct correlation exists: (∆mV = β∆mC )x,y,z.

The decreasing of resulting component of tensor in direction of

positively charged plate of condenser (+):

(∆m1,2 · c2)+

C )1,2 · v2

z =(cid:2)(m+

1,2(cid:3)+

z

(58e)

corresponds to decreasing of gravitational attraction and electro-
magnetic interaction presumably in this direction (+z) as respect to
directions, opposite (-z) and normal (±x, ±y) to this one. This may
explain the asymmetric Biefeld-Brown eﬀect.

If both plates of condenser have the same charge, then inde-
pendently of sign of charge, the amplitude and kinetic energy of
[nuclears+electronic shells] oscillations will be more limited in direc-
tion normal to plates, than in directions of the same plane, decreasing
selectively the normal component of gravitational interaction of mass
of dielectric between plates with Earth.

42

Charging the dielectric disk positively or negatively with exter-
nal source of charge - will lead to charge distribution near its sur-
face due to Coulomb repulsion. In this case the eﬀects will be the
same, as in the case of unipolar condensers, described above. The
electro-gravitational eﬀect will increase with relative rotation of discs
in accordance to mechanism proposed.

Our mechanism of Biefeld-Brown and related eﬀects - ex-
plains their dependence on mass of dielectric between plates, dielec-
tric permeability, as far it is related with polarizability and density
of dielectric, the density of electromagnetic energy between plates,
related to proximity of plates and voltage.

The mechanism predicts also, that the increasing of temperature,
declining the coherence of unharmonic nuclears oscillations at the
permanent other conditions (taking into account possible decreas-
ing of dielectric permeability) should decrease the values of electro-
gravity eﬀects.

It.is a way for experimental veriﬁcation of suggested mechanism,

based on our duality model.

THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST ACTION

AND PROBLEM OF TIME

It can be shown, that the Principle of Least Action is one, re-
ﬂecting the nonlocal Wave - quality of the World and its feedback
reaction with local Corpuscular - quality. After Lagrange, the action
for particle, like electron could be expressed as:

S =

t2Zt1

2Tkdt

(59)

If Tkin is the averaged kinetic energy of particle (or system of

particles) during the time interval: t = t2 − t1, we have from (59):

S = 2Tkint

(59a)

Representing the time interval (t) as an integer number of [C ⇋ W ]

pulsation period (T0) we have:

t = nTC⇋W = n · h/[(m+

C − m−

C )c2], where : n = 1, 2, 3, ...

(59b)

At condition of Golden mean, when:

C) = m0, we get:
t = nT0. This means that time is a discreet parameter and can be
quantizated.

(m+

C − m−

43

Using expression for doubled kinetic energy of particle in [C] and

[W]-phase eq.(12), we get the following expressions for action:

S = m+

C v2 · t = (m+

C − m−

C )c2 · t = [(m+

V − m−

V )c2/β] · t

(60)

We can see from (60) that the fundamental principle of least action:
δS = 0, leads to new formula, interrelating the positive pace of time
for particle or body (d ln t = dt/t) with the decreasing of its kinetic
energy, including real mass of particle (body) and its velocity:

d ln t = −d ln Tkin = −[d ln m+

C + 2d ln v]

(61)

The similar result we can get from principle of uncertainty in co-

herent form.

Condition (61) unify the pace of time for particle or system of
C /m+
C)

particles with pace of this system’s mass change (d ln m+
and with pace of its velocity change (d ln v = dv/v).

C = dm+

Another version of this formula interrelates the pace of time with
C ) and corresponding

particles mass - symmetry shift △mC = (m+
vacuum symmetry shift △mV = m+

C − m−

V = β△mC :

V − m−

△ ln t = −d ln(m+

C − m−

C ) = −d ln(m+

V − m−
V )

(62)

or : △ ln t = △ ln Eel = △ ln EG

Comparisons of this formula with those, describing the electromag-
netic (42) and gravitational (51) energy leads to important conclusion:
oscillations of electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds should be ac-
companied by time oscillations, i.e. TEMPORAL WAVES & FIELD
origination. Like electromagnetic and gravitational, the TEMPORAL
waves may form a standing, hologram-like pattern.

The TEMPORAL FIELD, consequently, is related directly and

may be inﬂuenced by electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds.

At the condition of Hidden Harmony and Golden mean, when
C ) = m0 = const, the pace of time for such system is

C − m−

△mC = (m+
zero:

△ ln t = −d ln m0 = 0

(62a)

This condition means the achievement of top of evolution/self-

organization of selected system.

Our approach to problem of time, based on eq.(61) leads to def-
inition: ”Time for any closed nonequilibrium or oscillating physical
system is a parameter, characterizing the pace of this system kinetic
energy (mass and velocity) change”.

In accordance to our model, the characteristic time for any closed
system (ti), including the Universe, is positive if the kinetic energy,

44

including the real mass of this system Mi and its velocity is decreasing
and negative in the opposite case:

ti = −

Tkin

dTkin/dt

= −(cid:20) Mi

dMi/dt

+ 2

v

dv/dt(cid:21)

(63)

This relation, derived from eq. (61) between the time and pace of

kinetic energy change is valid for any selected closed system.

When the pace of change of such system’s mass and velocity -
tends to zero, it determines the delay of diﬀerent physico-chemical
processes.

The course of time for any system could be characterized by the

time decrement, introduced as:

Di = exp(cid:18)−

ti

T0(cid:19)

(64)

where: T0 = 1/ν0 = h/(m0c2) is period of wave B [C⇋ W ] oscilla-

tions, corresponding to Hidden harmony condition.

Hierarchy of systems from atom to universe determines the cor-

responding hierarchy of time-scales.

If the decreasing of mass of system and its cooling, (kT → 0 and v →
0) is irreversible, for example as a result of IR photons radiation, the
time for this system is positive and irreversible also. This process
corresponds to second law of thermodynamics realization.

The Principle of least action in form (62) for the minimum time in-
terval (△t = min) means that charged and neutral particles ”choose”
the trajectory, corresponding to the minimum change of generated
by their propagation electromagnetic (ES
el ˜ ∆mC, eq.44a) and gravita-
tional (ES
G ˜ ∆mV , eq.51a) energy. This happens, for example, at the
conditions of Hidden harmony for selected system.

Such ability of particles (including photons) to ”seek out” this
optimal trajectory can be only a consequence of feedback reaction be-
tween their nonlocal due to vacuum amplitude waves (VAW) and local
properties of particles in a course of their [C ⇋ W ] pulsations. This
is a new quantum explanation of the fundamental Principle
of Least Action, based on our model.

For the other hand, formula (62) in combination of eqs.(42 and
49) means that the pace of time and, consequently, the dynamics of
diﬀerent process should be in-phase with oscillations of gravitational
and electromagnetic ﬁelds.

On macroscopic scale such oscillations can correspond to periods

of:

a) Earth rotation around its own axe;

45

m0

Ψ+ = (cid:12)(cid:12)m+
Ψ− = (cid:12)(cid:12)m−

C − m0(cid:12)(cid:12)

m0

(65)

(65a)

b) rotation of Earth around Sun and
c) rotation of Moon around Earth.

The experimental evidence of macroscopic oscillations of very
diﬀerent dynamic processes (physical, chemical and biological) of the
mentioned above periods has been obtained in long term systematic
observations by team of S. Shnol

from Moscow university.

NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE WAVE FUNCTION

Our dynamic duality model makes it possible to modify the in-
terpretation of the wave B function of Schr¨odinger equation. We can
present wave functions ψ and ψ∗ in dimensionless form, using the ef-

standing neutrino (ν0) :

fective mass of the electron [2ν0 +eν0], determined by uncompensated

On the microscopic level the wave function squared is dependent
on the product of instant values of real and mirror corpuscular mass
shifts: (∆m+· ∆m−), related to fraction of time (f t
C ), which particle
spend in corpuscular phase:

The product of real and mirror mass symmetry shift:
in Corpuscular phase is positive. In the Wave phase, when ∆m+ =

[(∆m+ · ∆m−) > 0]C

One can see from (66), that the mass symmetry shifts - changes
in-phase with probability of location of particle in [C] phase in the
any given volume of space, equal to the wave function squared |Ψ|2.

Our theory predicts that ﬁnding the way to shift the [C ⇋ W ] equilibrium

could be a way to change the real mass of body. For example, the
application of strong magnetic or electric ﬁelds, interacting with
CVC of the charged particles - can inﬂuence the vacuum symmetry
shift and change the real mass of body. This eﬀect may be used also
for propulsion of one matter throw another or big space-jumps.

46

The elementary particles of positive and negative charge, like elec-
trons and protons have the opposite inﬂuence on the vacuum symme-
try shift, i.e. gravitation. In accordance to our Alternative corpuscle-
wave model of atom, at some conditions, the distance between their
electron’s and proton’s can become very small as a result of violation
of Golden mean condition: (m+
C ) > m0 (see eq.44b). As condi-
tions of strong overlapping of their cumulative virtual clouds (CVC),
their opposite bi-vacuum shifts can totally or partially compensate
each other without annihilation. Our gravitation theory predicts,
that this eﬀect should be accompanied by decreasing of the eﬀective
mass of such atoms and their gravitational potential.

INTERRELATION BETWEEN MICROSCOPIC

[WAVE ⇋ CORPUSCLE] EQUILIBRIUM AND MACROSCOPIC

[VACUUMS ⇋ MATTER] EQUILIBRIUM

Physical vacuum in our theory is subdivided to Primordial BI-
VACUUM, existing without matter, and Secondary one [VACUUMS],
coexisting with matter and ﬁelds, produced by matter.

Secondary vacuum reﬂects the interference of the nonlocal vac-
uum amplitude waves (VAW), vacuum density waves(VDW) and vac-
uum symmetry waves (VSW) as a components of cumulative virtual
cloud (CVC), resulted from [C ⇋ W] pulsation of elementary par-
ticles. Secondary vacuum is a result of perturbations of superﬂuid
Primordial vacuum properties (energy slit and symmetry) by huge
number of particles.

It follows from our model, that coherent over the large-scale mi-
croscopic [Wave ⇋ Corpuscle] dynamic equilibrium of elementary par-
ticles - can lead to macroscopic [VACUUMS ⇋ MATTER] dynamic
equilibrium.

The asymmetrical state of the electron is related to semiperiod
of wave B, when one (unpaired) standing neutrino (v0) is in Corpus-

cular phase and pair (ν0 +eν0) is in the Wave phase.
In contrast to symmetrical [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of (ν0 +eν0) pairs,

generating nonlocal vacuum amplitude waves (VAW), the asymmet-
rical pulsation of uncompensated standing neutrino (ν0), accompa-
nied by [emission ⇋ absorption] of cumulative virtual cloud (CVC),
can be accompanied by energy (electromagnetic and gravitational)
transfer as far the resulting Pointing vector is nonzero. Such kind of
CVC can’t be superluminal or nonlocal. The same is true for bosons,
like photons, when one of [neutrino + antineutrino] pair have nonzero
resulting momentum and their spins have the same sign.

At the 1st semiperiod of wave B, when pair (ν0 +eν0) as a part of
the electron (2ν0 +eν0) or quark is in the [W] phase and forms posi-

tive and negative virtual quanta of (VACUUMS)ON with minimum

47

slit of bi-vacuum, the second standing neutrino (ν0) of the electron
is in Corpuscular state and forms the (MATTER)ON . This instant
situation on macroscopic scale corresponds to our perceptible ”ON”-
World.

At the 2nd semiperiod of wave B pulsation, when standing [neutrino-

antineutrino] pair (ν0 +eν0) is in [C] phase and the energy slit of

bi-vacuum (VAW) is increasing, the unpaired standing neutrino
(ν0) is in the [W] phase. At this moment our (VACUUMS)ON col-
lapses to hidden (MATTER)OF F . Simultaneously our explicated Cor-
puscular ”ON” World transforms to hidden implicated (VACUUMS)OF F .
Such enfolded, [VACUUMS + MATTER]OF F subsystem of the part
of the UNIVERSE with in-phase [C ⇋ W ] pulsation - is alternative to
unfolded [MATTER + VACUUMS ]ON subsystem.

The perception of World by bio-receptors and equipment normally
is limited by [ON] in-phase subsystem, corresponding to the ﬁrst of
two described above semiperiods only and ﬁelds, resulting from [ON
⇋ OFF] transitions. The dynamics of conversions between [ON] and
[OFF]− coherent Worlds due to their ultrahigh frequency cannot be
registered experimentally. The result of dynamic equilibrium be-
tween these subsystems in form of ﬁelds is detectable only.

The feedback reaction between [ON] and [OFF] coherent Worlds subsystems

as a consequence of nonlocality of VAW may exist as a condition for
the UNIVERSE self-organization.

The coherent molecular dynamics of real MATTERON , including
living organisms, with alternating acceleration and mass of parti-
cles (m+
C ) - is related with corresponding dynamics of VDW, VSW
and nonlocal VAW, beats between them and wave packets forma-
tion. Changing the part of this complicated interference picture with
hologram properties, induced by change of matter properties means
holomovement after Bohm.

Such holomovement can be imprinted in [VACUUMS]OF F and, con-
sequently, in [VACUUM]ON as the Informational Dynamic Replica
of our World. The deviation of Informational Replica from ”Ther-
mal Noise” of [VACUUMS]ON is dependent on the scale of coherent
molecular/atomic excitations, responsible for Virtual Replica origi-
nation.

PROPERTIES OF BI-VACUUM BOSONS (BVB),

VACUUM AMPLITUDE, VACUUM DENSITY AND

SYMMETRY WAVES

(VAW; VDW and VSW), AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATIONAL

FIELD

In corpuscular (collapsed) state the real corpuscular mass (m+
C )
of standing neutrino or antineutrino, in another terms:
[real vor-
tex+mirror rotor] or [mirror vortex+real rotor] dipoles determines

48

the real, measurable mass of particle or antiparticle. The mirror
mass (m−
C ) is hidden. As a result of beats between real and mirror
states, the both mass are equalizing and tending to mass of rest (m0)
of particle:

m+

C → m−

C → m0, where :(cid:12)(cid:12)m+

C(cid:12)(cid:12) > m0 >(cid:12)(cid:12)m−
C(cid:12)(cid:12)

C and m−

It happens due to partial conversion of m+

C to cumulative
cloud of positive and negative virtual quanta (CVC), corresponding
to [W]-phase of particle.

From eq.(9) it leads that at this phase, the mass symmetry shift
(△mC), the external impulse and external group velocity of BVB
(binding or anchor site of CVC ) turns to zero:

△mC = (m+

C − m−

C ) = 0; PC = 0 and v → 0

(67)

Putting the external group velocity: v = 0 to formula (19) one can
see, that at this condition the internal group and phase velocities
becomes equal to each other and to that of light velocity.

vin
gr = vin

ph = c

at m+

0 = m−

0 = m0

(67a)

It is a conditions of symmetric BVB existing as a pair of virtual
[rotor + antirotor]. The radius of BVB is equal to that of the elec-
tron’s cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) and the Compton radius at
the condition of Hidden harmony:

LBV B = /m0c = 3.86 × 10−13 m

(68)

The surfaces of positive and negative components of BVB and

their sum are equal to (16d).

0 = m−

Our notion of BI-VACUUM did not make limitations on the value
of m0 = m+
0 and, consequently radiuses of rotor and antiro-
tor, composing bi-vacuum bosons (BVB) because of compensation of
energy and impulse in the realm of bi-vacuum. The radiuses of ro-
tor (L+) and antirotor (L−) of BVB from principle of uncertainty in
coherent form: L± · P ± = /2 may be expressed like:

L+ =

+
2P + and L− =

−
2P −

(68a)

In the case of symmetric BVB with zero resulting momentum, we

have L+ = L− and P + + P − = 0.

The values of impulses in the framework of our model may vary
from |P +| = |P −| = m0c to |P +| = |P −| = MP l ·c, where m0 is a rest-mass
of the electron and MP l is the Plank mass. In principle, the variation
in mass and corresponding variation in diameter of rotor and antiro-
tor, forming diﬀerent BVB may be even bigger. However, judging

49

from discreet values of mass of elementary particles, the ”resonant”
values of BVB parameters: mass, impulse, radius must exist. The
minimum by dimensions BVB with resonant properties may form the
”molecules” of bi-vacuum as a quantum superﬂuid liquid. It means
that a scale fractal hierarchy of BVB may exist, which determines the
selected properties of bi-vacuum and that of elementary particles.

The idea of Neil Boyd about subquantum particles, composing
vacuum and elementary particles, is compatible with our model, if
we assume that they represent the smallest resonant BVB in their
ground (symmetric) and .excited (asymmetric) states.

The quantum beats between diﬀerent resonant conditions of sym-
metric BVB lead to excitation of nonlocal vacuum amplitude waves
(VAW).

The vacuum amplitude waves (VAW) display themselves as the
oscillation of energetic slit (∆AV AW ) between positive and negative
ground levels of bi-vacuum, equal to:

∆AV AW = (∆m+

V + ∆m−

V ) · c2

(69)

For the case of symmetric BVB excitation: ∆m+

V = ∆m−

V = ∆mV and

∆AV AW = 2∆mV

where two resonant energies of bi-vacuum are:

E0 = A0 = m0c2 and E1 = (m0 + ∆m0)c2

(70)

The radius of corresponding symmetrical BVB is equal to: L0

BV B =

/m0c and L1

BV B = /(m0 + ∆m0)c.

The frequency of VAW is:

νV AW = ∆AV AW /

(71)

After squaring the left formula in (70) and diﬀerentiation, taking
C we get after simple reorganizations:

into account, that m2

0 = m+

C · m−

d ln AV AW =

1
2

[d ln m+

C + d ln m−

C ] · c2

(72)

This formula points that acceleration of particles and correspond-
C should inﬂuence on the energy of vacuum

ing change of m+
C and m−
amplitude waves (VAW).

The excitation of VAW is accompanied by oscillation of BVB den-
sity, virtual pressure and correlated oscillation of energy in realms of
positive and negative vacuum. If we assume that between two con-
ducting plates the probability of big transitions, between diﬀerent co-
herent states of bi-vacuum and VAW excitation is less, than outside
of such ”condenser”, this explains Casimir eﬀect. Such probability

50

decreasing may happen due to stabilization of selected bi-vacuum ex-
citations (VAW) as a result of correlation of [C⇋ W ] transitions of
the electrons in two conducting plates. The correlation, in turn is
dependent on distant Van der Waals interaction between plates and
decrease with their separation.

In formula (69) the positive and negative vacuum symmetry shifts,

produced by standing neutrino (ν0) and antineutrino (eν0) of coherent
pairs [ν0 +eν0] in composition of elementary particles are deﬁned as:

(73)

V = m+
V = m−

V − m−
V − m+

(cid:2)∆m+
(cid:2)∆m−

V(cid:3)ν0
V(cid:3)eν0

The oscillations of bi-vacuum slit AV AW may be a result of peri-
odic acceleration of pair of standing [neutrino+antineutrino] or cor-
responding sub-elementary [particle+antiparticle] in [C] phase un-
der the inﬂuence of ﬁelds or in a course of vibrations of atoms and
molecules.

In the case if VAW-source has asymmetric shape, the ∆AV AW may
be considered as asymmetric scalar potential of informational ﬁeld,
then the corresponding component of informational ﬁeld is the vector
one, deﬁned as

−−−→
IV AW = grad (∆AV AW )

(74)

The instant propagation of VAW is related to nonlocal properties of
virtual Bose condensate of primordial BVB and BVB∗, perturbed by
VAW. The radius of perturbed by VAW bi-vacuum bosons is equal
to:

LBV B∗ = /[(m0 + ∆m±

V ) · c]

The corresponding scalar potential of BVB∗:

EBV B∗ = (m0 + ∆m±

V ) · c2

(75)

(75a)

From (9) it follows also that at conditions of primordial bi-vacuum, i.e.

0, the external wave B length of BVB and corresponding scale of their
virtual Bose condensation tends to inﬁnity:

in the absence of matter when: ∆mC =(cid:12)(cid:12)m+
λBV B = h/PBV B = h/(cid:2)(m+

C(cid:12)(cid:12) → 0 and(cid:0)vext
0 ) · c(cid:3) → ∞

The length of secondary BVB∗ in contrast to primordial BVB
has a huge, but limited dimension due to small diﬀerence of en-
ergy/impulses between virtual rotor and antirotor:

gr = v(cid:1) →

(76)

C − m−

0 − m−

λBV B∗= h/[(m+

0 +∆m+

V ) · c − (m−

0 +∆m−

V ) · c] < ∞

(77)

51

The results, obtained above, points, that the ability of some stable
particles, like free neutrino, photons, etc. to move with luminal ve-
locity is a consequence of the basic condition: the equality of the real
and mirror masses in the case of free neutrino (m+
C = m0), or
symmetric distribution of real masses for coherent pairs of [neutrino
+ antineutrino], forming photons.

C = m−

The gradient of diﬀerence of concentration of rotors (n+) and an-
tirotors (n−) of BVB with opposite direction of rotation (virtual spin
equilibrium shift), originated under the inﬂuence of rotating atoms,
molecules or macroscopic bodies - is responsible for TORSION ﬁeld,
introduced as:

−→
T n = grad(n+/n−)

(78)

The other torsion ﬁeld components, in accordance to our model,
may display itself also in the gradient of following properties of BVB
Bose condensate:

a) the internal radius of individual BVB as a pair of [rotor+antirotor]:

TR = grad(LBV B∗ )

(78a)

b) the external wave B length of secondary BVB∗, which deter-

mines the spatial scale of virtual Bose condensate:

Tλ = grad(λBV B∗ )

(78b)

c) the amplitude of torsion waves, determined by values of ∆TR

and ∆Tλ oscillations.

The [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of two standing neutrinos (2ν0) with op-

posite half-integral spins, forming part of the electron (2ν0 +eν0) are

counterphase. It means that when one of them is in [C] phase, the
other is always in the [W] phase. This makes these neutrinos as well
as two electrons of opposite spins spatially compatible and enable to
coherent exchange interaction by means of CVC. Such a mechanism
is used for explanation of Pauli principle.

dipole exchange interaction, introduced in our model. The charge,
energy and impulse of standing neutrino and antineutrino in pair

The [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of standing antineutrino (eν0) are in-phase
with one of these two neutrinos of triplet (2ν0 +eν0). They form the
coherent symmetric pair (ν0 +eν0), stabilized by special kind of dipole-
(ν0 +eν0) of electron, positron, quark or other fermions compensate

each other. The in-phase [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of such pairs are re-
sponsible for nonlocal VAW, virtual VDW and VSW standing waves

Standing electromagnetic, gravitational, torsion and nonlocal (in-
stant) VAW, as a quantum collective excitations of bi–vacuum Bose
condensate (BC), excited in a course of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of pairs

[ν0 +eν0] in composition of elementary particles - can be responsi-

ble for Informational ﬁeld, wholeness and self-organization process of
the Universe. This means that formation of dynamic coherent sys-
tem of standing waves: VDW and VSW, modulated by VAW, with
properties of 3D virtual hologram - is possible. The uniﬁed system:
[Secondary bi-vacuum + Matter] can evolve in a course of ”holomove-
ment” the - notion, introduced by Bohm.

Each elementary particle, atom, molecule or macroscopic body
is a source of nonlocal resulting informational ﬁeld with symmetry,
depending on their shape, dynamics and mass distribution.

Superposition of nonlocal vectorial informational ﬁelds, gener-
ated by spatial combination, mass and dynamics of all elements
in corpuscular phase represents the virtual Informational Dynamic
Replica of our real World.

All four kinds of virtual collective excitations, listed above, are
the oscillations of density, energy and symmetry of corresponding
kinds of virtual quanta. Consequently, their superposition and in-
terference, especially in form of virtual standing waves, may be ac-
companied by the ”ordering” of bi-vacuum, decreasing its entropy
and increasing the information. It is known that the entropy and
information are simple related to each other as:

S = (kB ln 2) · I

(82)

Each of 24 quantum excitations, pertinent for condensed matter,
in accordance to our Hierarchic theory of condensed matter (see:
www.karelia.ru/˜alexk [New articles], may have own contribution to
the informational entropy (82).

Hypothesis of Informational Vacuum Replica of

living organisms and its consequences

53

In any living organism: from microbe to elephant the more ordered
quasi-crystallin and sensitive structure - is a fraction of water in hol-
low core of MTs with diameter about 140 ˚A. The bigger is number of
MTs of coherently interacting cells, the bigger is corresponding frac-
tion of ordered water, very sensitive to nerve excitation. The spatial
and dynamic properties of MTs and internal water structure follow
the Golden mean rule. I have a special work, related to role of MTs in
Hierarchic model of consciousness (see: www.karelia.ru/˜alexk [Ab-
stracts and New articles].

Just this fraction of virtual waves, excited by water in MTs, is
responsible, in accordance to my hypothesis, for special virtual Infor-
mational ﬁeld (IF), characterizing the individuality as a product of
brain and peripheral nerve system activity.

In some cases, when corresponding [IF] form a complex system of
virtual standing waves with properties, close to conditions of Hidden
harmony:

vin
gr = vext
gr
vin
ph = vext
ph

(83)

it may remain stable even after the real source (living organism)

becomes destroyed or dead.

The Hidden harmony conditions mean the equality of pairs:

in-
ternal (hidden) and external group velocities; internal (hidden) and
external phase velocities (83).

This hypothesis, based on our theory, points to possibility of ex-
istence of ’SOUL’. Some of corresponding systems of such virtual
Informational replica of living organism really may be more or less
stable, depending on their properties as a systems of standing waves.
During the life of animal, plant or human being, the direct and
back reaction should exist between ’soul’ and organism, generating
this soul. This interaction may have a character of quantum beats. If
so, the important contribution to consciousness or MIND is provided
by acts of interaction between brain and ’soul’ in form of quantum
beats. Each individual soul is formed by interference of nonlocal
Vacuum Amplitude Waves (VAW) with standing vacuum density and
vacuum symmetry waves (VDW and VSW) of the all nerve cells of
living organism. The nonlocal character of each individual soul makes
it possible souls interaction and even uniﬁcation.

The idea of collective informational soul is close to idea of NOO-

SPHERE, proposed by Vernadsky at the beginning of this century.

If we make one more step ahead, we can suppose that uniﬁcation
of all souls of human beings, animals, plants of all planets with any
forms of life over the Universe may form virtual dynamic Super-
Consciousness.

54

Due to mentioned above feedback reaction, the evolving of Super-
Consciousness is dependent on evolution of the intelligent part of
biosphere of the Universe and vice-verse.

The inﬂuence of Golden mean - based 3D rigid geometrical

structures (Harmonizators) on surrounding medium

To explain this eﬀect, we assume that 3D structures, like cross,
pyramids, double cones, etc. with proportions, following Golden
mean (GM) rule works as eﬀective generator of virtual image in bi-
vacuum, i.e. provide the ordering action on virtual quanta.

It may happens in a course of [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of particles, com-

posing GM-based structures. Pulsations of standing [neutrino+antineutrino]
pairs in composition of elementary particles (fermions) like electrons,
positrons and quarks - are accompanied by vacuum amplitude waves
(VAW) three-dimensional (3D) superposition with standing virtual
density and virtual symmetry waves (VDW± and VSW±).

VAW, in accordance to our model, represent symmetrical oscilla-
tions of energy slit between positive and negative vacuum without
vacuum symmetry shift, when:

∆mV = m+

V − m−

V = 0

(84)

If we use instead notion of standing neutrino/antineutrino, the
notion of [vortex+rotor] dipole, nothing will change in our consider-
ations.

The 3D interference pattern, formed by VDW± and VSW±, mod-
ulated by vibrations of atoms and molecules and VAW, with nonlocal
properties, modulated by [C] phase of standing [neutrino+antineutrino]
pairs in similar way, may serve Informational Replica of GM-based
structures. The VDW± and VSW±, in contrast to VAW, are the parts
of two cumulative virtual clouds (CVC±), related to [W] phase of the

same [ν0 +eν0] pairs.

In accordance to our model (eq.52), between the tensors of mass
symmetry shift and vacuum symmetry shift of uncompensated stand-
ing neutrino or antineutrino:

(cid:0)β(cid:12)(cid:12)m+

C(cid:12)(cid:12) =(cid:12)(cid:12)m+

V(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:1)1,2,3

C − m−

V − m−

(85)

and similar parameters of [ν0 +eν0] pairs - the strong correlation exists.

It means that 3D spatial distribution of electromagnetic, gravitational
and torsion potential of any solid body, determined by uncompen-
sated neutrinos and antineutrinos, rotors and antirotors of BVB -
should be reﬂected in corresponding properties of 3D complex holo-
gram, produced by all kind of standing waves, modulated by VAW as
a pilot wave. It was shown before, that electro-gravitational contri-
bution to secondary vacuum is related to temporal ﬁeld.

55

The important consequence of our model is that the closer are
properties of medium (object), as ”recipient” of action of Harmo-
nizator to conditions of Hidden harmony (see eq.21), the more is
inﬂuence of Informational Replica of Harmonizator as ”inductor”. It
is a condition of resonant kind of informational interaction via bi-
vacuum between ”inductor” and ”recipient”.

Telepathy, as informational exchange between living organisms
with resonant properties of their microtubules and internal water
- producing individual Informational Replicas, may be explained in a
similar way.

We have to assume in the mechanism proposed, that properties of
bi-vacuum virtual quanta has a fractal structure and tends to Hidden
harmony conditions (eq. 21) under the inﬂuence of Harmonizator.
It is the intermediate eﬀect, stimulating the next stage of action of
Harmonizator on liquids, solids, biosystems, etc. as a result of cor-
responding bi-vacuum perturbations inﬂuence on target particles in
[W] phase.

The eﬀect of Harmonizators on open systems looks to be related
with their ability to stimulate postulated in our work self-organization
as a natural spontaneous process, leading systems to conditions of
Hidden harmony. It is accompanied by the entropy decreasing and
storage of information. This process is opposite to tending the sys-
tems to thermal equilibrium or thermal death, corresponding to con-
ditions (25a).

Experimentally the inﬂuence of Harmonizators on virtual Informa-
tional Replica may be detected by the change of Casimir attraction
between two metallic sheets.

If our mechanism, proposed, is right, it means that most eﬀective
Harmonizators under certain conditions may serve as the pure energy
generators, shifting the open systems from thermal equilibrium.

The interrelation is predictable between the scale of real atomic/molecular

Bose condensation in condensed matter and inﬂuence of this matter
on nonlocal properties of bi-vacuum virtual Bose condensate. The
vacuum amplitude waves (VAW) may serve as the instant carrier
of information. The future instant transmitters/receivers of infor-
mation, containing cells of macroscopic Bose condensate (BC), like
superconductors, superﬂuids and crystals with modulated BC param-
eters, could be based on this principle. The more shape of these cells
follows the Golden mean rules, the bigger is predictable informational
eﬀect.

CONCLUSION

56

The formulae, obtained in our work, interrelate electric and mag-
netic elementary charges, electromagnetic and gravitational interac-
tions, theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, [mass - velocity
- space - time]. The dynamic model of duality provides the deeper
understanding of Pauli and Heizenberg principles. It is able also to
explain the quantum roots of Golden mean, as a result of revealed
Hidden Harmony conditions realization, principle of least action and.
The two slit experiment also can be explained without introducing
the notion of pilot wave.

The Alternative Corpuscle-Wave model of atom based on the in-
phase [C ⇋ W ] oscillations of the electrons and nuclear and 3D virtual
standing waves properties of their [W] phase is proposed.

The new fundamental principle of self-assembly of ”simple” sys-
tems physical systems, like elementary particles, atoms, molecules,
self-organization of complex open systems, like condensed matter,
star systems, galactics and evolution of very complex systems like
biopolymers (proteins, DNA, microtubules), cells, organisms - can
be formulated as: ”The diﬀerent selected systems on each level of
temporal and spatial hierarchy are tending spontaneously to condi-
tion of Hidden Harmony (equality of most important internal and
external parameters of de Broglie waves), which determines the
Golden Mean”.
If we deﬁne the nonequilibrium system as beau-
tiful, when it follows the Golden mean rule, then the formulated
principle of evolution is a ”driving force (hidden will)”, leading our
World to Hierarchical Beauty.

Abstract

In the context of a Planck scale underpinning for the universe, we
argue that both gravitation and electromagnetism can be character-
ized in a uniﬁed way, in a Sakharov like description. We also consider
the issue of observed gamma radiation, which recent observations seem
to indicate are caused by the annihilation of exotic M ev particles, as
indeed was theoretically predicted earlier. Some other problems are
also considered.

It was shown that a pion could be considered to be the lowest energy state

while the universe itself could be considered to have an underpinning of
nN = ¯N
10120 of these Planck oscillators [1, 2]. The number N is well
known from the time of Eddington, while ¯N features in more recent studies
(Cf. also [3]). A consequence of this is the set of relations quoted below

where R

and mass of a typical elementary particle like the pion and ﬁnally lP , tP , mP
are the Planck length, time and mass. All these relations can be easily veri-
ﬁed to be correct.
It may be mentioned that the ﬁrst of equations (2) is the well known Ed-
dington formula. This and similar equations involving N were the basis for
the Dirac Cosmology [4] and should be considered in an order of magnitude
sense, or as Wheeler puts it [5], the distinction between the masses of the
electron and the pion, for example being ignored.
Let us use the well known fact [6] that the gravitational energy of an isotropic
sphere of N elementary particles of radius R can be obtained from the equa-
tion

GM
c2 =
We can see that the mass M or energy of the universe obtained from (4) is
in terms of gravitation, while the same mass M (or energy) obtained from
(3) and (2) is in terms of the underpinning of Planck oscillators without any
reference to gravitation. Infact equating the two we get [7]

GNm

(4)

We can easily verify that (5) is indeed correct. Infact (5) was alternatively
deduced in a model that correctly predicted a dark energy driven accelerating
universe with a small cosmological constant as also deduced all the large
number coincidental relations referred to along with the mysterious so called
Weinberg formula [8, 9, 10]

which was otherwise considered to be an inexplicable accident.
We note that (5) can be rewritten as the well known electromagnetism-
gravitation ratio

(6)

Equation (6) has also been considered to be one of the coincidental large
number relations. We can appreciate the signiﬁcance of (5) or (6) if, fol-
lowing Hayakawa [11] we equate the excess of electrical potential energy of
the electrons in the universe due to the ﬂuctuation in the particle number

√N, with the inertial energy of the elementary particle, viz.,

∼

√Ne2

R ≈

mc2

This leads to (6) or (5).
Infact it was pointed out [12] that once (6) was
deduced rather than taken as an adhoc coincidence, this meant that already
it pointed towards an uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and gravitation. Equa-
tions (5) or (6) show that gravitation appears as the excess or residual energy
over N particles rather on the lines of Sakharov’s analysis using the Quan-
tum vaccuum and the Planck scale, as indeed has been the rationale above
[5, 13].
The question that arises is, can we similarly consider the electromagnetic
interaction between elementary particles to be the residual energy of the un-
derpinning Planck oscillators, between elementary particles. In other words
in (5) if we replace N by a number P which is
0(1) then we should get
instead of Gm2 the gravitational coupling e2 the electromagnetic coupling.
Infact we get

∼

e2

lmc2

≈

(7)

which is indeed true.
We can further support the above characterization in equations (5) and (6) of
gravitation as a form of “weak electromagnetism” (or “weak electric force”)
or electromagnetism as a form of strong gravitation as follows: (It must be
borne in mind that the terms weak electromagnetism and strong gravitation
were used several years ago in diﬀerent contexts). Firstly we observe that an
equation like (4) with a numerical factor 2 on the right side (which in the
large number context is not important) gives the Schwarschild radius of a
black hole of mass M. If Gm2, M for the moment being replaced by m, is
substituted by e2 in (4), then we should get the corresponding “Schwarschild
radius” for electromagnetism treated as strong gravitation. Indeed we then
get (7) giving the Compton wavelength for the mass m. In other words the
Compton wavelength shows up as a non gravitational but rather electromag-
netic Schwarschild radius on the scale of elementary particles.
Let us now consider the temperature and life time of a black hole in the

context of the Hawking-Beckenstein radiation. In the usual theory we have

From (12) we get, for the pion, a life time

which is the pion Compton time.
Thus for elementary particles, working within the context of gravitational
theory, but with a scaled up coupling constant, we get the meaningful re-
lations (7), (12) and (11) giving the Compton length and Compton time as
also the Hagedorn temperature as the analogues of the Schwarzschild ra-
dius, radiation life time and black hole temperature obtained with the usual
Gravitational coupling constant.

2 Discussion

1. The role of the Planck scale in Quantum Gravity considerations is well
known. We reiterate that what has been done is that the same reasoning
used in the theory of black holes within a purely gravitational framework
can be extended to electromagnetic considerations, and then this leads to
the Compton scale of elementary particles.
In this sense, there is just a
rescaling.
2. The Planck scale considerations, as is well known lead to a modiﬁcation of
the Uncertainty Principle (Cf. [16, 17] and several references therein). There
is now, in addition to the usual Heisenberg Uncertainty term, an additional
term given by

∆p
¯h
√nmP , given the fact that as
As the Uncertainty in the momentum ∆p
pointed out in the beginning there are n Planck oscillators deﬁning a typical
elementary particle, we have from (13)

∆x = l2

(13)

∼

l = l2

P √n

mP c

= √nlP

which is just (1). So the modiﬁcation of the Uncertainty relation due to
Planck scale considerations lead to the Compton scale.
3. Already we have referred to Sakharov’s formulation of gravitation in terms
of the background Zero Point Field (or Quantum vaccuum) (Cf.ref.[5, 13]).
In this context let us recapitulate the following well known fact [5, 12]: Due
to the Zero Point oscillators, there is an electromagnetic ﬁeld density ∆B
over an interval L given by

So the energy over an extension L = l is given from (14) by e2
energy mc2 of the elementary particle itself,

l which is the

(16) shows that we can similarly obtain from the ﬂuctuating background
Zero Point Field a black hole, infact a Planck scale black hole, it being well
known that a Planck mass is a Schwarzschild black hole at the Planck scale
(Cf. also ref.[18]). From this point of view, Planck mass particles are created
from the ﬂuctuation of the zero Point Field and then lead up to elementary
particles as above. In any case, this again brings out the interchangability,

4. We have seen above how from the background Zero Point Field Planck
scale particles can “condense”. Let us suppose that n such particles are
formed. We can then use the well known fact that [19] for a collection of
ultra relativistic particles, in this case the Planck oscillators, the various
centres of mass form a two dimensional disk of radius l given by

Gm2.

where in (17) me(
m in the large number sense) is the electron mass and β
is the angular momentum of the system. Further l is such that for distances
r < l, we encounter negative energies.
It will at once be apparent that
for an electron, for which β = ¯h
2 , (17) gives the Compton wavelength. We
can further characterize (17) as follows: By the deﬁnition of the angular
momentum of the system of Planck particles moving with relativistic speeds,
we have

In (18) we have used the fact that the disk of mass centres is two dimensional,
and σ has been inserted to stress the fact that we are dealing with a two

The right side of (18) gives the angular momentum for the electron. From
(18) we get

σl2mP = me

which ofcourse is correct.

a fact which we encountered earlier. (19) also gives another puzzling coinci-
dence namely

lP = σl3
This is the explanation for the fact that the cube of the electron Compton
wavelength numerically equals the Planck length.
5. Dirac, and later Wheeler [20] had considered the possibility that the “rate
of time” may be diﬀerent for diﬀerent interactions. Let us now touch upon
this aspect, in the light of the above considerations. Firstly, we observe that
there are two basic scales in the universe. The electroweak-strong microscopic
scale and the gravitational macroscopic or cosmic scale. The time and length
scales for these two broad regions are given by the well known relations

R = √Nl, T = √Nτ

(Cf. relations (2)). However, c is same for both scales. Now if we consider
the representation of the Hamiltonian as the time derivative operator we will
get

H(T ) =

=

d
dT

d
√Ndτ

=

H(τ )
√N

wherein we have used (20). H(T ) in (21) denotes gravitation represented by
the coupling constant Gm2 and H(τ ) in (21) denotes electromagnetism rep-
resented by the coupling constant e2e and m referring to the same elementary
particle. Whence (21) gives

which infact is the well known supposedly accidental ratio of the coupling
constants encountered earlier.
Let us now consider the analogue of the microscopic relation,

for the macro or cosmic scale. We then get

hgcm2/sec

ML2/T = H

This equation, is infact perfectly meanlingful because H in (22) is the Godel
spin of the universe [21, 22]. Infact (22) leads to

(22) and (23) show that the universe itself seems to follow a Quantum Me-
chanical behaviour with a scaled up Planck constant H as argued previously
[23, 24].
The above considerations can be modelled by the universality and scaling ef-
fects of Critical Point Phenomena and the Renormalization Group [25]: The
universe is a coarse grained scaled up version of the micro world, gravitation
being the counterpart of electromagnetism given by their mutual scaled ratio.
Interestingly if the above considerations are carried over to the Planck scale
versus the Compton scale, we can easily verify that there is no new scaled
down Planck constant, as for example in (22)– that is the Planck scale con-
siderations remain the same as the Compton scale.
6. Considering extremal black holes, it was pointed out by the author [26]
that the observed gamma rays could be attributed to particles with mass
1Mev, and with a charge of the order of that of a monopole viz., 1000e. It
∼
is interesting that recent analysis of observed data by Boehm and co-workers
conﬁrms these conclusions [27].
Infact there is a spectrum of possibilities as seen below. Let us start with
the radius of the Kerr-Newman metric

It can be seen that there is a naked singularity, which however disappears if
there is no spin, and moreover

(24)

From (24) it can be seen that apart from the possibility mentioned above,
we could have particles with the charge e but mass a thousandth that of an
electron or we could have particles with masses that of the neutrino, that is
a mass one hundred millionth that of the electron or less. These particles
would have a charge one millionth or less the electron charge [28] and so on.
All these physical microscopic black holes could in principle be produced from
the background ZPF, but they would be almost instantaneous particles wilth
a negligible Beckenstein Radiation Life Time. However they would annihilate
themselves in contact with their anti particles and produce gamma radiation.
(Infact it was arguyed that a photon could be considered to be a neutrino
anti-neutrino bound state [29]). This indeed is a conclusion drawn by Boehm
and co-workers.

ψ =

in terms of basic states φn which could be eigen states of energy for example,
with eigen values En. It is known that (25) can be written as

(Infact n could stand for not a single state but for a set of states nı and so
also m). Here the bar denotes a time average over a suitable interval. This is
the well known Random Phase Axiom and arises due to the total randomness
amongst the phases cn. Also the expectation value of any operator 0 is given
by

2(φn, 0φn)/

(26) and (28) show that eﬀectively we have incoherent states φ1, φ2,
once
averages over time intervals for the phases cn in (27) vanish owing to their
relative randomness. In the light of the preceding discussion of random ﬂuc-
tuations, we can interpret all this meaningfully: We can identify φn with
the ZPF. The time averages are the zitterbewegung averages over intervals
¯h
mc2 . We then get disconnected or incoherent particles from a single back-
∼
ground of vaccuum ﬂuctuations exactly as before. The incoherence arises
because of the well known random phase relation (27) that is after averaging
over the suitable interval.
Infact this can be seen more explicitly as follo9ws. We consider now for
simplicity the free particle Dirac equation. The solutions are of the type,

The point is that in (31) there are interference terms– terms corresponding to
zitterbewegung in the Dirac electron theory. These interference terms vanish,
as in (27), when suitable averages are taken, over the Compton scale, and
then we are left with terms that contain no interference, like the ﬁrst two
terms on the right side of equation (27). This corresponds to the equation
(26).
8. We may ﬁnally observe that at the Compton scale we have the equation

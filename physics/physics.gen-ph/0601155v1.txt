Abstract.

The principles of the physical description of non-inertial frames of reference
are analyzed. The systems of physical reality description (PhRD) are introduced
on base of generalization of the relativistic principle in special and general theories
of relativity. Physical objects and their interactions from diﬀerent systems of
PhRD are examined. A lot of conformities between considered objects and their
interactions with known physical objects and fundamental interactions both in
micro- and macro-scales are found.

1. Principles of the physical description of non-inertial frames of
reference.

It is known from the special theory of relativity, that laws of physics are invariant
concerning inertial frames, i.e. moving rectilinearly and uniformly in “empty” space.
Such formulation means a relativity of movement, but does not give an answer to a
question: concerning what movement in “empty” space can be determined? How to
choose the inertial system?

It is possible to ﬁnd some answers to these questions from the principle of
relativity of Poincar´e [1] generalized by A.Logunov [2] as follows: “For any physical
frame of references (inertial or non-inertial), it is always possible to select the system
of other frames, in which all physical processes are going similar to the initial frame, so
we do not have and it is impossible to have any experimental possibilities to distinguish
. . . what, exactly, frame from this inﬁnite system we are in”.

This approach leads to another logical diﬃculty: which one from two non-inertial
to each other observers may be considered as an inertial one? The principle of relativity
doesn’t give a criteria to choose.

It seems that in general theory of relativity the problem is implicitly solved more
particularly. Actually, the principle of equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses
connects the space-time topometry with existing physical objects (gravitating bodies,

Relativistic and Quantum Properties of Spatial Rotations

particles, ﬁelds). The movement over geodesic lines is considered instead of inertial
motion, so inertial motion is deﬁned by the topology, by the distribution of matter
in the Universe. The World is such what it is. At ﬁrst sight it seems that this is an
answer, but is it really?

The ﬁrst of all, the principle of relativity of GTR is valid both for any local region
(in micro-scale) and far from the gravitating bodies (in macro-scale). It is one of the
basic GTR principles. At least for these regions the problem is not solved.

Another and more principal point may be formulated as follows. Let’s consider
again two non-inertial to each other observers from the point of view of Logunov’s
principle. The space-time properties will be quite diﬀerent for them. It will be shown
in the following analysis that even observable regions may not coincide with each
other for non-inertial observers. Does the same “physical world”, the same “physical
objects” every observer see? If not, every observer has chance to build his own space-
time topometry based on observable by him physical objects (gravitating bodies,
particles, ﬁelds). So, we still don’t have a criteria to choose.

It is incredible, but it exists a possibility to generalize the Logunov’s and
GTR approaches to relativity. On base of this generalization some decisions of the
formulated problem may be gotten.

We shall guess, that the physical reality may be considered by any observer only
within the framework of some chosen system of the physical reality description (system
of PhRD) (see. Fig.1). The choice of this or that system of PhRD is deﬁned in
connection with the physical objects existing in it. The observer by himself is a part
of his own system of PhRD.

Figure 1. System of the physical reality description.

The suggested approach has far-reaching consequences. For example, there is
probable an existence together with our system of PhRD a lot of other systems
with their “own” physical objects, physical
laws and properties of space-time.
Consideration of various systems of PhRD essentially diﬀers from studying of inertial
or non-inertial movement of physical objects inside some ﬁxed system of PhRD. For
example, with the description of non-inertial movement the general theory of relativity
can be quite consulted.

Our subject is an investigation of physical objects from various systems of PhRD,
their properties and an opportunity of their observation from other systems. We
need to note at once , that if such objects really exist, their properties should not
“considerably” contradict to authentically known physical laws and need to have
correspondences with some known physical objects in system of the observer. We
shall name this principle a principle of compatibility for systems of PhRD.

On basis of the suggested approach, we also shall consider systems of PhRD
for spatial rotation which further we shall name simply systems of space (or spatial)
rotation.

2. Structure of spatial rotation objects.

The metrics in frame K ′ uniformly rotating in space around some spatial axis (we shall
consider, without loosing generality, an axis 0z) with frequency of rotation ωz = Ωzc,
where c is speed of light in system of the observer K, in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z)
can be determined (see, for example, L.D.Landau, L.M.Lifschitz [3]) as:

It is considered, that this expression can be used up to some distance (we shall
name it further the horizon of events) ρh = c/ωz = 1/Ωz from an axis of rotation
determined in system of the observer, otherwise the factor g00 (the factor at dτ 2) of
metric tensor will be negative, that is considered inadmissible.

In respect to the approach suggested in the previous section, the system of
PhRD can be created for any combination of spatial rotations. For simplicity we
shall consider a case at which axes of rotation from a combination of rotations
at least have one common point which we shall name the common point or the
center of rotation.
In this case in system of the observer K and in system of
rotation K ′ it is possible to write down possible transformations of spatial coordinates
X = (x, y, z) = (x1, x2, x3) = (xα), α = 1, 2, 3 with help of expressions:

Expression (4) determines elements of metric tensor in system of the observer
for spatial rotations. In case of MSR and SSR the elements of metric tensor depend
on time, we shall examine their values as average on time of observation. If time of
observation is much greater the period of any considered rotation from a combination

The approach proposed in section 1, allows to expand treatment of the metrics
in systems of rotation. Physical objects of rotation are not obliged to be at all only
inside the horizon of events. This requirement is necessary for physical objects from
system of PhRD of the observer. Physical objects of rotation from point of sight of
other system of PhRD we shall subdivide on observable, taking place inside horizon
of events in system of the observer (g00 > 0) and non-observable ones, taking place
outside (g00 < 0).
The equation

T = 0 determines a conditional spatial border between
observable and non-observable objects of rotation in system of PhRD where this
equation is determined. In case of axial rotation it will be a set of cylindroids around
of an axis of rotation (at various frequencies of rotation), and in case of MSR and SSR
a set of ellipsoids (see Fig.2).

From the point of view of the external observer the proper time in system of
rotation tends to inﬁnity at approach to horizon of events, since at g00 →

[3]. So, observable objects

of rotation seem “captured” inside the area limited by horizon of events. As the
signature of the metrics in internal area coincides with the signature of the metrics of
the observer, physical objects of rotation in this area can “be identiﬁed” in system of
the observer and their properties can be investigated by “visible”, “strong” interactions
with others, already known physical objects from system of the observer.

It is hardly possible to identify the non-observable objects of rotation in system of
the observer in connection with change of existential perception. Some opportunities
of the description of such objects are suggested in the following section.

3. The Description of objects of rotation

Let’s the function ψ′(X ′) corresponds to some object of rotation in system of PhRD
K ′. We shall try to ﬁnd function ψ(X, τ ), determined in system of the observer K
and corresponding to ψ′: ψ(X, τ ) ⇋ ψ′(X ′). Attempts to ﬁnd the exact mathematical
description of physical objects of rotation in system of the observer seem doubtful,
because it is impossible to synchronize clocks between frames. It is clear also from
= ψ′[XR(τ )]. We shall try to ﬁnd the available
the analysis of section 2, that ψ(X, τ )

Let’s consider a case of a periodic matrix of rotation R(τ ) with the period
T = 2π/Ω: R(τ ) = R(τ + 2π/Ω). As far as it is impossible to synchronize clocks
∞
n=0 and will check
between frames, we shall form some set of points Λ:
{
the coincidence of functions ψ(X, τ ) ⇋ ψ′(X ′) on Λ.
In these points according to
expression (2) X coincides with X ′ (we shall write down it by deﬁnition as: X ′ = X|Λ).
In a case examined by us it is possible to write also: ψ′(X ′) = ψ(X, τ )|Λ§
Any function of a kind: ψ(X, τ ) = ψo(X)λ(X, Ω, τ ) + µ(X, Ω, τ ), where ψ′(X ′) =
ψo(X)|Λ, λ(X, Ω, τ )|Λ = 1 and µ(X, Ω, τ )|Λ = 0 will satisfy to a condition of equality
of functions corresponding to object of rotation in various systems of PhRD, since
ψ′(X ′) = ψ(X, τ )|Λ. For such functions λ and µ it is possible to present required
function in the equivalent form:

τo + 2πn/Ω

}

.

ψ(X, τ ) = ψo(X)λ(X, Ω, τ ) + ψo(X)µ(X, Ω, τ ),

As far as the system of rotation should pass into system of the observer at

frequency of rotation tending to zero: ψ(X, τ )

→

The most simple way to satisfy to necessary conditions to functions λ and µ is
0. It will correspond to a trivial case of non-rotating system
to demand: λ
of PhRD (rotating with zero frequency of rotation), coincides with the system of the
observer.

Comparing the function of object of rotation and the wave function of a free
particle with rest mass mo it is possible to get Ω = moc/~ and to come to a parity
~ω = moc2. Note, that expression (7) will correspond to de Broglie’s wave if to consider
it from inertial K L to system of the observer K frame (it is considered without loosing
the generality X L = (x, y, zL), γ = 1/

if the term ei(Ωnτ L) is neglected.

It means that the “internal” properties are
neglected and are replaced with some “macroparameters” (energy, momentum, rest
mass etc.).

The description of the considered objects of spatial rotation (the set of all objects
of rotation is much wider) correlates with the description of objects of quantum
mechanics. From the mathematical point of view, this description is approximate
because concurrences can be checked up only on countable set of points Λ. Even at
great values of Ω the information about function ψ′(X ′) can be exact enough, but is
always incomplete.

In points of set Λ function (7) satisﬁes as group of rotations

(3) and Lorentz
group. According to our principle of compatibility entered in section 1, “in a fashion
standard of the quantum theory” (L.Ryder [4]; Landau, Lifschitz [5]), entering the
operators corresponding to macro-characteristics of object, it is possible to get the
basic equations of quantum mechanics, such as Klein-Gordon, Schr¨odinger and Dirac,
as they are based on application of known space-time properties in system of the
observer to the objects described by functions of a kind (7).

4. Quantization of objects of rotation

Objects of rotation should visualize themselves as some “inﬂuences”, known ﬁelds
in system of the observer, otherwise it would not be possible to consider and try to
describe them. Also, we want to ﬁnd stable objects, and they cannot be an inﬁnite
energy source. There are two opportunities to satisfy to these conditions: to consider,
that raised ﬁelds do not transfer energy or that ﬁelds are located in space.

Let’s assume, that the object of rotation described by function ψ(X, τ ) (7), in
system of the observer K can be a source of an electromagnetic ﬁeld u(X, τ ). Then this
ﬁeld should be described by the wave equation and corresponding Helmholtz equation
(received with the substitution u(X, τ ) = U (X) exp(iΩτ )):

(cid:3)u(X, τ ) = ψ(X, τ ),

Helmholtz equation gives the steady-state solutions. The analysis of solutions of
the wave equation (9) shows, that at the beginning, during the process of “formation”
of object of rotation (or changing of its state) some objects “departing from it” with
speed of the excited waves are formed also. This process is shown on Fig. 4 in 1D-
case.

Thus, the stable object of rotation can not radiate energy in system of PhRD of
the observer. Necessary conditions for this are that its spatial sizes and frequencies
of rotation are quantized. The stable state of object of rotation corresponds to the
ﬁxed frequency of rotation, i.e. the uniformly rotating system. Transition between
stable states of object of rotation is accompanied by formation of ”departing” objects
in system of the observer.

5. Objects of spatial rotation in micro- and macro-scales

It was mentioned above in Sect.1 that the principle of relativity is valid in general
theory of relativity both for any local region (in micro-scale) and far from the
gravitating bodies (in macro-scale). It is one of the basic GTR principles. Exactly

Figure 4. Formation of object of rotation.

in these regions our “new” physical objects may ﬁnd quite interesting physical
interpretation.

The description of objects of rotation in micro-scale (in the ﬁeld of elementary
particles and physical vacuum) is the description of their properties from the point of
view of the external observer, in relation to system of rotation.

From this point of view the properties of non-observable objects of rotation
(in external regions) in many respects coincide with objects of quantum mechanics.
Functions such as wave functions correspond to objects of rotation in the system of
the observer, and they satisfy to the equations of quantum mechanics (Klein-Gordon,
Schr¨odinger and Dirac). States of objects of rotation are quantized, some of them are
inherent in spin characteristics.

Observable objects of rotation (in internal regions) can be identiﬁed in system of
the observer, hence, can interact with other physical objects. Observable objects seem
“captured” inside the area bounded by horizon of events. From system of the observer
it can be looked as the phenomenon of conﬁnement. In quantum ﬁeld models, the new
type of interactions - the strong one was introduced in addition to gravitational and
electromagnetic interactions to explain this phenomenon. It was not a consequence of
the physical worldview at that time and, of course, this new interaction needed to be
declared as a fundamental one.

The suggested model could be checked up on the experiment proposed by
Academician of RAS G.T.Zatsepin in interaction of massive particles or nucleus of
atoms with high energy massive particles. If time of interaction tc is less than the
minimal period of internal rotation of a target particle T = 2π/ω = 2π~/(Moc2), than
particles produced during interaction should lie in the same spatial plane. Energy

of interaction may be estimated as:

already proved experimentally. It seems that both weak and strong “fundamental”
interactions are straight consequences of ideas declared above.

In this paper, the physical objects were mainly investigated in micro-scale. Very
interesting development of declared ideas is being looked through in macro-scale. The
system of the observer may also be considered as system of rotation. This way the
observer is located inside the horizon of events of system of rotation. Note, that
the horizon of events exists only for observer from diﬀerent system of PhRD. The
horizon of events can not be perceived by observer in his own system of PhRD. The
non-observable objects will be perceived by observer as a strange substance changing
our visible space-time topology. Now, good candidates for such substance exists in
astronomy.
It is so-called dark matter, dark energy. The quantized ﬁelds excited
by these objects may be perceived as streams of particles penetrating our Universe
in diﬀerent directions. Such sight at objects of rotations in macro-scale may appear
useful at the consideration of nowaday problems of astrophysics.

I would like to express the sincere gratitude to Academician of the Russian Academy
of Science G.T.Zatsepin for moral support of this work and gratitude to Professor
L.H.Ryder for useful discussions.

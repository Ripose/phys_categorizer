Abstract

It was proposed by Haisch, Rueda and Puthoﬀ that the inertia of matter could be interpreted at least
in part as a reaction force originating in interactions between the electromagnetic zero-point ﬁeld (ZPF)
and the elementary charged consitutents (quarks and electrons) of matter. Within the limited context of
that analysis, it appeared that Newton’s equation of motion (f = ma) could be inferred from Maxwell’s
equations as applied to the ZPF, i.e. the stochastic electrodynamics (SED) version of the quantum vacuum.
We report on a new approach which avoids the ad hoc particle-ﬁeld interaction model (Planck oscillator)
of that analysis, as well as its concomitant formulational complexity.
Instead, it is shown that a non-
zero ZPF momentum ﬂux arises naturally in accelerating coordinate frames from the standard relativistic
transformations of electromagnetic ﬁelds. Scattering of this ZPF momentum ﬂux by an object will yield
a reaction force that may be interpreted as a contribution to the object’s inertia. This new formulation is
properly covariant yielding the relativistic equation of motion: F = dP/dτ . Our approach is related by the
principle of equivalence to Sakharov’s conjecture of a connection between Einstein action and the vacuum. If
correct, this concept would substitute for Mach’s principle and imply that no further mass-giving Higgs-type
ﬁelds may be required to explain the inertia of material objects, although extensions to include the zero-point
ﬁelds of the other fundamental interactions may be necessary for a complete theory of inertia.

1. Introduction

Vigier [1] has recently presented a discussion of the “unsolved mystery in modern physics” known as
inertia, the instantaneous opposition to acceleration of all material objects. In the view of Newton it was an
inherent property of matter for which no further explanation was possible. In the nineteenth century Mach
proposed, on the basis of relativity of all motion, that inertia somehow originated in a collective linkage of all
matter in the Universe. No successful quantitative formulation of Mach’s principle has ever been developed
[2]. A preliminary attempt by Sciama [3] resulted in a prediction that was later shown to be contradicted
by observations. In his formulation, the asymmetrical distribution of surrounding matter in the Milky Way
galaxy should give rise to a directional dependence of inertial mass of order ∆m/m = 10−7. This prediction
is contradicted by the experiments of Hughes and Drever showing that ∆m/m ≤ 10−20 [4]. This experiment
furthermore shows that the material entity responsible for inertia, if other than the particle itself, displays
a very remarkable degree of isotropy.

It is well known that general relativity does not embody Mach’s principle: Solutions of the ﬁeld equations
are possible for an empty universe and for a rotating universe. Additional conﬂicts with Mach’s principle
have been presented by Vigier [1] and by Rindler [5]. An additional motivation for ﬁnding a basis of inertia
involving locally-originating forces may be preservation of causality, since Mach’s principle would appear to
call for instantaneous action at a distance of some sort. The view proposed herein, which is presented in
full detail by the authors elsewhere [6], proposes to substitute for Mach’s principle a local electrodynamic
interaction which is perfectly consistent with causality.

We concentrate solely on the electromagnetic vacuum, leaving the almost certain contributions of other
vacuum ﬁelds, such as the case of the Dirac vacuum discussed by Vigier [1], for further extensions of the
theory. The original development of this concept by Haisch, Rueda and Puthoﬀ [7] depended upon Lorentz
force interactions between the charged particles constituting matter (quarks and electrons) and the elec-
tromagnetic ZPF. The more general formulation presented herein is independent of speciﬁc particle-ﬁeld
interactions. All that is needed to generate an acceleration-dependent reaction force that may be interpreted
as inertia is for a scattering-like process of the ZPF radiation to occur in any material object undergoing
acceleration. The inertia of composite particles such as protons and neutrons would arise via ZPF scattering
at the level of the individual quarks. The neutrino, being apparently a truly neutral particle, should not have
any inertial mass, consistent with current expectations. The theory at this early stage also does not address
certain properties of bosons, such as the gravitational deﬂection of photons, and the apparent masses of the
Z 0, W + and W − bosons mediating the weak interaction.

The concept we present is a descendent of a conjecture by Sakharov for a connection of Einstein action
and the vacuum [8]. The principle of equivalence would imply that gravitation and inertia must have a
similar connection to the ZPF. A preliminary development of the Sakharov conjecture in the context of SED
was carried out by Puthoﬀ [9]. While Puthoﬀ’s concept we view as promising, certain problems remain
[9]. Nevertheless the general Sakharov and Puthoﬀ concept does answer the potential criticism that a real,
inertia-generating ZPF should generate an unacceptably large cosmological constant. This is not the case,
since it would be the eﬀect of the ZPF on charged particles that would generate gravitation in the Sakharov-
Puthoﬀ approach, not the ZPF in and of itself. The energy density of the ZPF cannot be equivalent to
gravitating mass; for further discussion of the astrophysical implications see Haisch and Rueda [10].

2. Inertia as a Reaction Force

Newton’s second law may be most generally written as

which is the limiting form of the space part of the relativistic four-force:

f =

dp
dt

= lim
∆t→0

∆p
∆t

,

F =

= γ

dp
dτ

dp
dt

,

which for the case when β → 0 and γ → 1 becomes Eq. (1)

It is seen that the second law is a deﬁnition of force as the rate of change of momentum imparted to
an object by an agent. Having deﬁned force, Newton’s third law states that such a force will result in the
creation of an equal and opposite reaction force back upon the accelerating agent. This now makes the
concept of inertia a necessity: Inertia must be attributed to the accelerating object in order to generate
the equal and opposite reaction force upon the agent required by the third law. It is our proposition that
resistance from the vacuum is the physical basis of that reaction force. One can interpret this as either the
origin of inertia of matter or as a substitute for the concept of innate inertia of matter. Inertia becomes a
placeholder for this heretofore undiscovered vacuum-based reaction force which is a necessary requirement
of Newton’s third law. Force is then seen to be a primary concept; inertia is not.

This can be made explicit as follows. Newton’s third law is a statement about symmetry in nature for

contact forces such that an applied force f , must necessarily result in a reaction force fr

Inertia as the dynamical extension of this law can be made explicit by writing the f = ma relation as

which makes it clear that inertia as a resistance to acceleration is equivalent to a reaction force of the form

f = −fr.

f = −(−ma),

fr = −ma.

It is an experimental fact that to accelerate an object a force must be applied by an agent and that
the agent will thus experience an equal and opposite force so long as the acceleration continues. We argue
that this equal and opposite force also has a deeper physical cause: the scattering of or interaction with
ZPF radiation. We demonstrate that from the point of view of a nearby inertial observer there exists a net
energy and momentum ﬂux (derived from the Poynting vector) of ZPF radiation transiting the accelerating
object in a direction necessarily opposite to the acceleration vector. The scattering opacity of the object to
the transiting ﬂux creates the back-reaction force customarily called the inertial reaction. Inertia is thus, in
part, a special kind of electromagnetic drag eﬀect, namely one that is acceleration-dependent since only in
accelerating frames is the ZPF perceived as asymmetric. In stationary or uniform-motion frames the ZPF is
perfectly isotropic.

Following the approach in [7] and [11] we consider the case of uniform acceleration, a, which results in
hyperbolic motion [12]. We deﬁne three coordinate systems. S is a non-inertial frame in which a uniformly
accelerating object is ﬁxed at the point (c2/a, 0, 0). I∗ is the inertial laboratory frame. Iτ is a series of inertial
frames whose (c2/a, 0, 0) point at proper time τ corresponds instantaneously with object point (c2/a, 0, 0)
in S, i.e. it is an instantaneously co-moving frame. The acceleration of this point of S with respect to Iτ is
always a for all proper times τ . At τ = 0 the (c2/a, 0, 0) point of S also coincides with the (c2/a, 0, 0) point of
I∗. The acceleration of the (c2/a, 0, 0) point of S as seen from I∗ is a∗ = γ−3
τ a [12]. We take the acceleration
to be along the x-axis, a = aˆx. The Rindler non-inertial frame S is rigid and it has approximately the same

3

constant acceleration within a small neighborhood of the center of the accelerating object. (But as is well
known the acceleration is not by any means the same everywhere throughout S.)

With these coordinate deﬁnitions in place we can examine the object vs. ZPF momentum relations that
need to be satisﬁed to justify the proposition that an electromagnetic reaction force can account for inertia.
At proper time ∆τ let an object be instantaneously at rest in the inertial coordinate frame I∆τ at the point
(c2/a, 0, 0) of that frame. Moreover at the object proper time τ = 0 (that corresponds to the time t∗ = 0 of
I∗), the object was instantaneously at rest at the point (c2/a, 0, 0) of the laboratory inertial frame. After a
short lapse of laboratory time ∆t∗ > 0 that corresponds to the object proper time ∆τ , the object is seen,
from the viewpoint of I∗, to have received from the accelerating agent the amount of impulse or momentum
increment ∆p∗. The expression (1) but as seen in I∗ is thus

f∗ =

dp∗
dt∗

= lim

∆t∗→0

∆p∗
∆t∗

.

At the corresponding object proper time ∆τ , the object is instantaneously at rest in the comoving inertial
frame I∆τ . Consequently the momentum of the object at proper time ∆τ as viewed in I∆τ is of course zero.

Our goal is to show that a ZPF electromagnetic reaction force will prove to be the exact opposite of

this, and can therefore reasonably be interpreted as the inertia of the object, i.e. that in general

We will arrive at this by speciﬁcally considering the condition in the I∗ frame,

The key is to ﬁnd whether f zp (or f zp
∗ ) will prove, from relativistic electrodynamics, to be proportional to
−a. When we compare Eqs. (1), (5) and (7), it follows that if the accelerating agent by means of the force f
gives to the object during object proper time interval ∆τ an impulse or change of momentum ∆p, there must
be a corresponding impulse (change of momentum) ∆pzp provided by the ZPF in the opposite direction to
∆p so that

if our proposition is to be true. Hence ∆pzp is the matching reactive counter-impulse given by the ZPF that
opposes the impulse ∆p given by the accelerating agent. We refer both ∆pzp and ∆p to the same inertial
frame and in this case to the laboratory frame I∗ and write as the required condition,

As this momentum change for the object ∆p∗ is calculated with respect to the inertial frame (that conven-
tionally we call the laboratory frame) I∗ and not with respect to any other frame, (e.g., the inertial frame
I∆τ ) it is necessary to calculate the putative ZPF-induced opposing impulse ∆pzp
∗ with respect to the same
inertial frame I∗ (and not with respect to I∆τ or any other frame). We write

∆pzp

∗ = pzp

∗ (∆t∗) − pzp

∗ (0) = pzp

∗ (∆t∗).

The momentum pzp
t∗ = ∆t∗. The last equality follows from symmetry of the ZPF distribution as viewed in I∗ that leads to

∗ (∆t∗) is essentially the integral of dpzp
∗

from I∗-frame time t∗ = 0 to I∗-frame time

In what follows we seek to ﬁnd a mathematical expression for the ZPF-induced inertia reaction force
f zp
∗ . For this purpose it is useful to state that from Newton’s third law and the force deﬁned above we can
write that the following must be true if our hypothesis is correct:

f zp = fr = −f .

f zp
∗ = fr∗ = −f∗.

∆pzp = −∆p

∆pzp

∗ = −∆p∗.

If the inertia origin propounded here is correct then Eq. (13), at least in the subrelativistic case, should
yield a nonvanishing force f zp
that is parallel to the direction of the acceleration a = aˆx, opposite to it, and
∗
proportional to the acceleration magnitude a = |a|.

3. The ZPF in the Accelerating Frame

We concern ourselves with the ZPF momentum ﬂux entering an accelerating object. Consider the
following simple ﬂuid analogy involving as a heuristic device a constant velocity and a spatially varying
density (in place of the usual hyperbolic motion through a uniform vacuum medium). Let a small geometric
ﬁgure of a ﬁxed proper volume V0 move uniformly with constant subrelativistic velocity v along the x-
direction. The volume V0 we imagine as always immersed in a ﬂuid that is isotropic, homogeneous and at
rest, except such that its density ρ(x) increases in the x-direction but is uniform in the y- and z-directions.
Hence, as this small ﬁxed volume V0 moves in the x-direction, the mass enclosed in its volume, V0ρ(x),
increases. In an inertial frame at rest with respect to the geometric ﬁgure the mass of the volume, V0ρ(x),
is seen to grow. Concomitantly it is realized that the volume V0 is sweeping through the ﬂuid and that
this V0ρ(x) mass grows because there is a net inﬂux of mass coming into V0 in a direction opposite to the
direction of the velocity. In an analogous fashion, for the more complex situation envisaged in this paper,
simultaneously with the steady growth of the ZPF momentum contained within the volume of the object, the
object is sweeping through the ZPF of the I∗ inertial observer and for him there is a net inﬂux of momentum
density coming from the background into the object and in a direction opposite to that of the velocity of
the object.

To calculate the ZPF momentum ﬂux we transform the customary SED representation of the ZPF from
an inertial to an acclerating frame. For the case of the hyperbolic motion [7][11][12], the velocity ux(τ ) = βτ c
of the object point ﬁxed in S with respect to I∗, is

R∗ and t∗ refer respectively to the space and time coordinates of the point of observation of the ﬁeld in
I∗. The phase term θ(k, λ) is a family of random variables, uniformly distributed between 0 and 2π, whose
mutually independent elements are indexed by the wavevector k and the polarization index λ (or more
technically, θ(k, λ) is a stochastic process with index set {(k, λ)}).

A simple Lorentz rotation from I∗ into Iτ allows us to calculate the Ezp and Bzp in Iτ . We assume
that the ﬁelds as seen in Iτ to also correspond to the ﬁelds as instantaneously seen in S. A crucial point is
the following. Though the ﬁelds at the object point in S and in the corresponding point of the co-moving
frame Iτ that instantaneously coincides with the object point are exactly the same, this does not mean that
detectors in S and in Iτ will be subject to the same eﬀect, i.e., experience the same radiation-ﬁeld time

5

(14)

(15)

(16a)

(16b)

evolution. Detectors need time to perform their measurements: This necessarily involves integration over
some interval of time and the evolution of the ﬁelds in S and in Iτ are obviously diﬀerent. Hence a detector
at rest in Iτ and the same detector at rest in S do not experience the same thing. Summarizing, while the
two ﬁelds, namely that of S and that of Iτ , are the same at a given space-time point, the evolution of the
ﬁeld in S and the evolution of the ﬁeld in Iτ are by no means the same. Furthermore any ﬁeld or radiation
measurements in Iτ and in S both take some time and are not conﬁned to a single space-time point.

We clarify the notation used in the sense that all polarization components are understood to be scalars,
i.e., directional cosines, but written in the form ˆǫi(k, λ) ≡ ˆǫ · ˆxi, where ˆxi = ˆx, ˆy, ˆz; i = x, y, z, stands for
three unit vectors along the three space directions. The karat in ˆǫi(k, λ) means that the directional cosines
come from axial projections of the polarization unit vector ˆǫ . We use the same convention for components
of the ˆk unit vector where, e.g., ˆkx denotes ˆk · ˆx. We can select space and time coordinates and orientation
in I∗ such that [7][11]

This is the ZPF as instantaneously viewed from the object ﬁxed to the point (c2/a, 0, 0) of S that is performing
the hyperbolic motion.

As it is the ZPF radiation background of I∗ in the act of being swept through by the object which we
are calculating now, we ﬁx our attention on a ﬁxed point of I∗, say the point of the observer at (c2/a, 0, 0)
of I∗, that momentarily coincides with the object at the object proper time τ = 0, and consider that point
as referred to the inertial frame Iτ that instantaneously will coincide with the object at a future generalized
object proper time τ > 0. Hence we compute the Iτ -frame Poynting vector, but evaluated at the (c2/a, 0, 0)
space point of the I∗ inertial frame, namely in Iτ at the Iτ space-time point:

The integrals are now taken with respect to the I∗ ZPF background as that is the background that the
I∗-observer considers the object to be sweeping through. This is why we denote this Poynting vector as Nzp
∗ ,
with an asterisk subindex instead of a τ subindex, to indicate that it refers to the ZPF of I∗. Observe that in
the last equality of Eq. (22) the term proportional to the x-projection of the ordinary ZPF Poynting vector
of I∗ vanishes. The net amount of momentum of the background the object has swept through after a time

4. Momentum Flux and Newtonian Inertia

(22)

(23)

(24)

Any observer at rest in an inertial frame sees the ZPF isotropically distributed and thus the Poynting
vector Nzp and the momentum density gzp = Nzp/c2 vanish. This is of course the case for the observer
at rest in I∗. Consider now another inertial observer located at a geometric point that, with respect to I∗,
moves uniformly with constant velocity, v = ˆxvx = ˆxβc. Imagine the instant of time when the geometric
point is passing and in the immediate neighborhood of the stationary I∗ observer. Both observers necessarily
see the ZPF symmetrically and isotropically distributed around themselves in their own frames. However,
the ZPF for each observer is not, because of the Doppler shifts, isotropically distributed with respect to the
other frame. The I∗-observer is located at the center of his own k-sphere, but the moving point is necessarily
located oﬀ-center of the I∗-observer’s k-sphere [6]. Hence, for the I∗-observer the ZPF Poynting vector,
Nzp
∗ , impinging on the moving point should appear to be
non-vanishing. Furthermore, because the motion of the geometric point is uniform, not hyperbolic, both the
Nzp
∗ at the moving geometric point appear to the I∗-observer to be time-independent constants of
the motion. We interpret this as the basis of the concept of momentum. A complete discussion is found in
[6], particularly Appendix B therein.

∗ , and the corresponding momentum density, gzp

∗ and gzp

Extend the consideration above to all the points inside a small ǫ-neighborhood of the previous geometric
point that comove with constant velocity v = ˆxcβ. Let V0 be the proper volume of that neighborhood.
Because of length contraction such neighborhood has, in I∗, the volume V∗ = V0/γ. Clearly to the observer
in I∗ the neighborhood’s gzp
∗ do not appear as vanishing because of the uniform motion with constant
velocity, v = ˆxβc, inducing Doppler shifts of all the neighborhood’s points with respect to I∗. If the said
neighborhood exactly coincides with the location and geometry of a moving object of proper volume V0 and
rest mass m0 that has the neighborhood’s central geometric point at its center, then according to ordinary
mechanics, the object appears to the observer in I∗ as carrying a mechanical momentum p∗ = γm0v.

∗ and Nzp

We turn now to the object’s corresponding ZPF momentum. Because the object occupies its proper
volume V0 and coincides with the uniformly moving ǫ-neighborhood, it has for the observer at rest in I∗ an

7

amount of ZPF momentum, V∗g∗ = (V0/γ)g∗, as described above. We re-emphasize that when measured
and from the point of view of the inertial observer comoving with the object, both the object momentum and
the Poynting vector of the ZPF do exactly vanish, the last because in k-space the object is at the center of
that observer’s k-sphere [6]. In the present case of a constant velocity and zero acceleration for the object,
as opposed to the general case we have been considering of accelerated hyperbolic motion, the momenta p∗
and pzp

∗ above are both of course constants. Hence their time derivatives in Eq. (13) both vanish.

We return to our original hyperbolic motion problem and compute the Poynting vector (a more complete
discussion of this is found in Appendix A of [6]) that the radiation should have at the (c2/a, 0, 0) point of I∗
but referred to Iτ with the coordinates of Eq. (21), viz,

where Ezp and Bzp stand for Ezp
τ (0, τ ) respectively as in the case of Eq. (23) and where as
in Eqs. (22), (23) and (24) the integration is understood to proceed over the k-sphere of I∗. The object
now is not in uniform but instead in accelerated motion. If suddenly at proper time τ the motion were to
switch from hyperbolic back to uniform because the accelerating action disappeared, we would just need to
replace in Eq. (25) the constant rapidity s at that instant for aτ , and βτ in Eq. (14) would then become
tanh(s/c). (But then Nzp would cease to be, for all times onward, a function of τ and force expressions as
Eq. (28) below would vanish.) Observe that we make explicit the τ dependence of this as well as of the
subsequent quantities below. Nzp
∗ (τ ) represents energy ﬂux, i.e., energy per unit area and per unit time
in the x-direction. It also implies a parallel, x-directed momentum density, i.e., ﬁeld momentum per unit
volume incoming towards the object position, (c2/a, 0, 0) of S, at object proper time τ and as estimated
from the viewpoint of I∗. Explicitly such momentum density is

where we now introduce the henceforth frequency-dependent coupling coeﬃcient, 0 ≤ η(ω) ≤ 1, that quan-
tiﬁes the fraction of absorption or scattering at each frequency. Let V0 be the proper volume of the object,
namely the volume that the object has in the reference frame Iτ where it is instantaneously at rest at proper
time τ . From the viewpoint of I∗, however, such volume is then V∗ = V0/γτ because of Lorentz contraction.
The amount of momentum due to the radiation inside the volume of the object according to I∗, i.e., the
radiation momentum in the volume of the object viewed at the laboratory is

which is again Eq. (24).

At proper time τ = 0, the (c2/a, 0, 0) point of the laboratory inertial system I∗ instantaneously coincides
and comoves with the object point of the Rindler frame S in which the object is ﬁxed. The observer located
at x∗ = c2/a, y∗ = 0, z∗ = 0 instantaneously, at t∗ = 0, coincides and comoves with the object but because
the latter is accelerated with constant acceleration a, the object according to I∗ should receive a time rate
of change of incoming ZPF momentum of the form:

(28)

We postulate that such rate of change may be identiﬁed with a force from the ZPF on the object.
Such interpretation, intuitively at least, looks extremely natural. In this respect Rindler [12] in introducing

Newton’s second law makes the following important epistemological point: “This is only ‘half’ a law; for it
is a mere deﬁnition of force,” and this is precisely the sense in which we introduce it here as a deﬁnition of
the force of reaction by the ZPF. If the object has a proper volume V0, the force exerted on the object by
the radiation from the ZPF as seen in I∗ at t∗ = 0 is then

is an invariant scalar with the dimension of mass. The expression for mi diﬀers considerably from the
corresponding one in [7] because here, on purpose, no interaction features were included in the analysis.
Such ZPF-particle interactions will be taken up in future work. Observe that in Eq. (30) we have neglected
a factor of 4/3. Such factor must be neglected because a fully covariant analysis shows that it disappears [6].
The corresponding form of mi as written (and without the 4/3 factor) is then susceptible of a very natural
interpretation: Inertial mass of an object is that fraction of the energy of the ZPF radiation enclosed within
the object that interacts with it (parametrized by the η(ω) factor in the integrand).

Clearly if the acceleration suddenly ceases at proper time τ , Eqs.

(28) and (29) identically vanish,
signaling the fact that acceleration is the reason that the vacuum produces the opposition that we identify
with the force of reaction known as inertia. From the proper time instant τ when the acceleration a is turned
oﬀ, the object continues in uniform motion. The object proceeds onwards with the rapidity s it acquired up
to that point, namely aτ . Thus βτ in Eq. (14) and all quantities from Eqs. (25) to (27) become constants, as
the rapidity s ceases to depend on the proper time τ . Because of the Lorentz invariance of the ZPF energy
density spectrum [13], the object is left at rest in the inertial frame Iτ and at the center of the k-sphere of
the Iτ observer but oﬀ-center of the k-sphere of the I∗ one [6]. From the I∗ perspective the object appears
to possess a momentum (which reﬂects the ZPF momentum inside V0). Observe furthermore that in Eq.
(30) and previous equations some cut-oﬀ procedure is implicit in that η(ω) subsides at high frequencies.

5. Relativistic Force Expression

The coeﬃcient mi that we identify with the ZPF contribution to inertial mass, corresponds then just
to the ZPF-induced part of the rest mass of the object. If the vacuum exerts an opposition force on the
accelerated object of magnitude −mia as in Eq. (29) and if Newton’s third law holds, then the accelerating
agent must exert an active force f of amount f = mia to produce the acceleration. This is the basis of
Newton’s equation of motion. The radiative opposition made by the vacuum precisely coincides time-wise
with the onset of acceleration at every point throughout the interior of the accelerated object, continues
exactly so long as the acceleration persists and is in direct proportion to the amount of mass associated with
that small region.

It is important to add that our analysis yields not just the nonrelativistic Newtonian case but it also
embodies a fully relativistic description within special relativity [11] at least for the case of longitudinal
forces, i.e., forces parallel to the direction of motion. Moreover the extension to the more general case
where the accelerating or applied force f is non-uniform, (i.e., it changes both in magnitude and direction
throughout the motion of the object) is readily envisaged [6].

From the deﬁnition of the momentum pzp

∗ in Eq. (27), from Eqs. (28), (29), and the force equation (8)

it immediately follows that the momentum of the object is

in exact agreement with the momentum expression for a moving object in special relativity. The expression
for the space vector component of the four-force is then

p∗ = miγτ ~βτ c,

and as the force is pure in the sense of Rindler [11], the correct form for the four-force immediately follows:

6. Conclusions

(32)

(33)

The new development here is simpler than that of [7] in that it does not deal with the dynamics of
modeled particle-ﬁeld interactions, but exclusively with the form of the ZPF in relation to an accelerated
object. The ﬁnal result is derived using standard relativistic ﬁeld transformations and does not involve
approximations. We extend the approch of [7] in deriving not only f = ma from Maxwell’s equations as
applied to the ZPF, but a properly relativistic equation of motion, F = dP/dτ . The fully covariant analysis
is presented in [6].

The inertia of protons and neutrons would arise via ZPF scattering at the level of the individual quarks.
As presently formulated, our theory would not account for any possible neutrino mass. Nor does the theory
at this stage address certain properties of bosons, such as the gravitational deﬂection of photons, and the
apparent masses of the Z 0, W + and W − bosons mediating the weak interaction. One can naturally conjecture
that analogous reaction forces interpreted as inertial mass would arise in a more general way with the zero-
point ﬂuctuations of other ﬁelds (like those of the weak and of the strong interactions). The general idea is
that rather than postulating an ad hoc mass-giving ﬁeld on top of all the other ﬁelds, to examine instead if
inertia can be explained by means of the already well-established (vacuum) ﬁelds of one form or another, as
e.g. the approach of Vigier [1].

We very explicitly used the ordinary notion of what force is. So we cannot claim any direct explanation
of that concept, not even a clariﬁcation of what force means. With respect to this classical force concept
what we believe we have done is the following. Newton’s third law requires that the motive force deﬁned
in the second law be counterbalanced by a reaction force. This has traditionally been satisﬁed implicitly by
assuming the existence of inertia of matter. We propose to have found an explicit origin for this reaction
force, viz. the acceleration-dependent scattering of ZPF radiation that the accelerated object is forced to
move into. Our analysis presupposed electrodynamics and special relativity and other aspects of ordinary
classical theory: Electrodynamics and some aspects of special relativity have been used in our developments
since we used SED (that besides Maxwell’s equations also presupposes the Lorentz force). As far as radiation
reaction is concerned we merely suspect that it is somewhat connected with the developments here but so
far this is only a suspicion.

Finally we make two disclaimers. We have used the methodology of SED. Recent work by Ibison and
Haisch [13] has resolved an important discrepancy between SED and quantum electrodynamics (QED).
Nevertheless a quantum theory-based derivation of this proposal for inertia is highly desireable. Second, we
are not prepared to face the issue of how and in what sense our development might possibly aﬀect or relate
to general relativity (beyond what was brieﬂy mentioned concerning Sakharov’s hypothesis and the principle
of equivalence).

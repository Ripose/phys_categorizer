Existence of Negative Gravity Material
Identiﬁcation of Dark Energy

James G. Gilson j.g.gilson@qmul.ac.uk∗

February 21, 2014

Abstract

A solution to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations via the Friedman equations is
shown to produce a cosmological model that is in exact agreement with
the measurements made by the dark energy astronomers. All the essen-
tial physical parameters are obtained as epoch dependent functions all
in closed form. The equations of state are obtained for total density,
non-dark energy density and dark energy density. An interpretation of
the structure involving a dark energy mass distribution that is twice the
usual value is shown to clarify greatly the physical signiﬁcance of the
mathematics. It is asserted that the astronomer’s measurements together
with the mathematical model proves that the universe is permeated uni-
formly with a positive mass density that caries a negative gravitational
constant, -G, characteristic. This mass component is identiﬁed with the
dark energy content of the universe that has been postulated to explain
the observed acceleration. Another result implied by the model is that
there is twice the amount of dark energy that is usually considered to be
present.

1 Introduction

The work to be described in this paper is a detailed analysis of a conclusion
hinted at in the paper A Dust Universe Solution to the Dark Energy Problem [5].
The conclusion arrived at there was that the dark energy substance is physical
material with a positive density, as is usual, but with a negative gravity, -G,
characteristic. References to equations in that paper will be prefaced with the
letter A. The work in A and its extension here has it origins in the studies
of Einstein’s general relativity in the Friedman equations context to be found
in references ([17],[23],[22],[21],[20],[19],[4],[5]) and similarly motivated work in
references ([11],[10],[9],[8],[6]) and ([13],[14],[15],[16],[8]). Other useful sources
of information have been references ([18],[3]) with the measurement essentials
coming from references ([1],[2],[12]).

After the astronomical observations some eight years ago implying that the
expansion of the universe is accelerating there has been overwhelming research
into trying to ﬁnd an explanation of what is happening and how it all does
or does not ﬁt into general relativity theory. The acceleration phenomenon is
widely described as very mysterious. This is particularly in connection with

2 SUMMARY OF MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE OF MODEL

the material called dark energy which is thought to produce a negative pressure
that causes the acceleration. As a positive pressure in the general relativity
generated Friedman equations is thought to be due to gravitational attraction,
the measured acceleration is seen vaguely as being caused by dark energy being
gravitationally repulsive. However, it has seemed to be diﬃcult to ﬁt the ob-
servations into general relativity theory. I think the basis of all the theoretical
diﬃculties lies with what Einstein called his greatest mistake, the introduction
of his cosmological constant Λ to stabilise his model which without Λ would itself
suﬀer positive acceleration. I think the mistake was in fact not the introduction
of Λ which actually brilliantly achieved his objective but rather the association
of Λ with the mass density function ρΛ which was assumed to represent the
mystery repulsive dark energy material. As this concept was obviously eﬀective
in stabilising Einstein’s model it has for the last hundred years been regarded
as a physically correct assumption and so it always appears in Λ orientated dis-
cussions of the Friedman equations. In A, I showed that if the density function
for dark energy is rather deﬁned as ρ†
Λ = Λc2/(4πG) = 2ρΛ then, dark energy
becomes a distribution of positive mass that carries a negatively gravitational
constant, −G. The dark energy model for the universe introduced in A, then
accurately describes the dynamics and kinematics of the actual measured uni-
verse parameters and most of the mystery vanishes. It all turns on recognising
that the universe contains a uniform and minutely small density distribution of
negative gravity characterised material. I give a strong case for these ideas in
the following pages by showing that the model from A has a complete solution
giving for example the equations of state for the total mass distribution density,
ρ(t), the dark energy material distribution, ρΛ, and the density distribution,
ρG(t), for the rest of the material of which the universe is constituted.

2 Summary of Mathematical Structure of Model

The main theoretical basis for the work to be discussed here are the two Fried-
man equations that derive from general relativity,

8πGρ(t)r2/3 = ˙r2 + (k − Λr2/3)c2

−8πGP (t)r/c2 = 2¨r + ˙r2/r + (k/r − Λr)c2

in the case k = 0 and a positively valued Λ we have,

8πGρ(t)r2/3 = ˙r2 − |Λ|r2c2/3
−8πGP (t)r/c2 = 2¨r + ˙r2/r − |Λ|rc2.

The main results obtained from the dark energy model for ease of reference are
listed next,

r(t) = (RΛ/c)2/3C1/3 sinh2/3(±3ct/(2RΛ))

b = (RΛ/c)2/3C1/3
C = 8πGρ(t)r3/3
RΛ = |3/Λ|1/2
θ±(t) = ±3ct/(2RΛ)
r(t) = b sinh2/3(θ±(t))
v(t) = ±(bc/RΛ) sinh−1/3(θ±(t)) cosh(θ±(t))
a(t) = b(c/(RΛ))2 sinh2/3(θ±(t))(3 − coth2(θ±(t)))/2

3 THE PSEUDO MASS DENSITY

P (t) = (−c2/(8πG))(2¨r(t)/r(t) + H 2(t) − 3(c/RΛ)2)
P (t) ≡ 0 ∀ t

PΛ = (−3c2/(8πG))(c/RΛ)2
ρΛ = (3/(8πG))(c/RΛ)2
ρ†
Λ = (3/(4πG))(c/RΛ)2 = 2ρΛ.

The function r(t) is the radius or scale factor1 for this model([3]). The acceler-
ation a(t) can also be expressed as

Λ − ρ(t))/3 = a(t)
Λ − ρ(t))/(3r2)

ΛG/r2 − MU G/r2

¨r(t) = 4πrG(ρ†
= 4πr3G(ρ†
= M †
Λ = 4πr3ρ†
M †
Λ/3
MU = 4πr3ρ(t)/3

where M †
mass within the universe. From equation(A2.19), we have

Λ is the total dark energy mass within the universe and MU is the total

8πGρ(t)r2/3 + Λr2c2/3 = ˙r2

8πGρ(t) + Λc2 = 3H 2(t)

8πGρ(t) = 3H 2(t) − Λc2

ρ(t) = (3/(8πG))(H 2(t) − (c/RΛ)2)

(2.26)
(2.27)
= (3/(8πG))(c/RΛ)2(coth2(θ+(t)) − 1) (2.28)
= (3/(8πG))(c/RΛ)2(sinh−2(3ct/(2RΛ))(2.29)
= (3/(8πG))C/r3(t)
(2.30)
= 3MU /(4πr3(t)) = MU /VU (t).
(2.31)

Equation (2.31) conﬁrms the mass density of the universe character of ρ(t).

3 The Pseudo Mass Density

The mass densities introduced in this theoretical construction, so far, are ρΛ,
ρ†
Λ and ρ(t). The ﬁrst of these is what Einstein would have regarded as the
repulsive material density within the universe to be associated with his Λ term
added to overcome the intrinsic expansion process and give his static universe.
The second one, is numerically twice the ﬁrst which I have introduced for reasons
about to be explained. The third density is the total material density for the
model being discussed. These are three legitimate mass densities in particular
conforming to the usually accepted requirement that mass should always be
positive.
I now introduce another density of great importance which will be
denoted by ρG(t) and deﬁned by

ρG(t) = ρ(t) − ρ†
Λ.

This is clearly not a legitimate mass density as it can become negative if ρ(t) <
ρ†
Λ. However, if we rewrite it as

ρG(t) = (G+ρ(t) + G−ρ†

Λ)/G

G+ = +G
G− = −G,

1After writing A, I found mention of this scale factor in Michael Berry’s Book, p. 129.

(3.5)

(3.6)

the quantity ρG(t) can then be regarded as a legitimate gravitationally weighted
mass density and the equation (2.19) becomes

¨r(t) = −4πr(t)GρG(t)/3

2¨r(t)/r(t) = −8πGρG(t)/3.

There is another way in which the quantity ρG(t) can be legitimised. This is by
calling it a relative mass density. Then possible negative values can be explained
by arguing that it falls below the reference density ρ†
Λ for negative values. In
that situation the uniform constant dark energy value is simply acting as a
standard reference value throughout all space. Equation (3.5) or equation (3.6)
is exactly the classical Newtonian result for the acceleration at the boundary of
a spherical distribution positive G mass density distribution.

4 Component Masses

Using equations (2.14) and (3.6) the identically zero total pressure P (t) can be
expressed in the form

P (t) = c2ρG(t)/3 + (c2/8πG))(3(c/RΛ)2 − H 2(t)) ≡ 0.

(4.1)

In A, PM (t), the positive component of the pressure associated with ordinary
non-dark energy mass, was deﬁned as P (t) − PΛ. Here the notation has been
changed so that the M subscript is replaced with the G subscript, PG(t) =
PM (t), an improved designation for the pressure produced by the non-dark
energy material component of theuniverse. It follows from equation (4.1) with
the total pressure P (t) = PG(t) + PΛ that

ρG(t) = (3/(8πG))(H 2(t) − 3(c/RΛ)2)
PG(t) = P (t) − PΛ

= c2ρG(t)/3 + (−c2/(8πG))H 2(t) + (6c2/(8πG))(c/RΛ)2

(4.2)

(4.3)
(4.4)

using equation (2.16). Then as we have both PG(t) and ρG(t) for this compo-
nent, we can write down the equation of state for this component as

PG(t)/(c2ρG(t)) = 1/3 − (c2/((8πG))/(3c2/((8πG))

+ (c/RΛ)2/(H 2(t) − 3(c/RΛ)2)
(4.5)
= 1/3 − 1/3 + (c/RΛ)2/(coth2(3ct/(2RΛ)) − 3) (4.6)
= 1/(coth2(3ct/(2RΛ)) − 3) = ωG(t).
(4.7)

The equation of state for the total mass density, ρ(t), is given by equation (4.1)
in either of the forms,

P (t) = 0
ρG(t) = (3/8πG))(H 2(t) − 3(c/RΛ)2)

and because of the identically zero value of P (t) an ω value is not deﬁned. The
equation of state for the dark energy component is given by equation A(4.50)
as

ωΛ = PΛ/(c2ρΛ) = −(3c2/(8πG))(c/RΛ)2/(c2ρΛ)

= −1.

5 CONCLUSIONS

5 Conclusions

5

The cosmological model developed in A and further ampliﬁed here is rigorously
a solution to the full set of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations of general relativity via the
Friedman equations. The model also satisﬁes exactly the recent measurements
by the astronomical dark energy workers. The model is mathematically com-
plete as all the essential physical functions for, scale, velocity, acceleration, and
Hubble’s not so constant are given in closed form. The equations of state for the
universe’s total mass density and the two components for non-dark energy mass
density and dark energy mass density are given in closed form. One diﬀerence
from the usual models physical interpretation is that the dark energy material is
associated with twice the usual density that Einstein used. This diﬀerence has
radical consequences for the understanding of the whole physical structure of the
theory. In particular, it implies that there is twice a much dark energy material
present as hitherto has been thought to be present. Another major interpreta-
tional consequence is that dark energy material is positive mass that caries a
negative valued, -G, characteristic property. With regard to the often suggested
mystery that the enormous amount of dark energy present cannot be seen, a
calculation of the density value of ρ†
Λ shows it to be about the equivalent of less
than nine protons or hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. No wonder it cannot be
seen. It is also the case that if all the observable mass where un-clumped from
being galaxies and spread uniformly throughout the universe it also would be
unobservable. The ﬂatness of the model means that the expanding universe can
be regarded simply as an expanding 3-sphere enveloping more dark energy as
it increases in radius. Thus as this density is an absolute constant this increase
must come from the regions outside the universe’s spherical boundary. Thus
dark energy is more than just a characteristic of the interior of the universe, it
extends uniformly out into the three dimensional enveloping space into which
the universe is expanding. It is hyper-universal.

It is my contention that the astronomical measurements[1] together with
the inevitably following general relativity theoretical model derived in A[5] and
further developed in this paper constitute proof that there exists throughout
the universe and beyond extending into all hyperspace positive mass with a
negative gravitational characteristic, −G, additional to the rest of the universe
of swarming galaxies largely controlled locally by positive G.

Abstract

It is shown that a new quantum-foam in-ﬂow theory of gravity is mathematically equiv-
alent to the General Relativity theory of gravity for the operation of the Global Positioning
System (GPS). The diﬀerences between the two theories become experimentally evident in
other situations such as in the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, in the observation of absolute
motion and ipso facto in the observation of the in-ﬂow motion into the Sun, and in the obser-
vation of a new class of gravitational waves, eﬀects which are present in existing experimental
observations, but are not within General Relativity. This new theory of gravity arises within
the information-theoretic Process Physics.

Introduction

It has been extensively argued that the very successful operation of the Global Positioning System
(GPS) [1] is proof of the validity of the General Relativity formalism for gravity. However as is
well known, and was most clearly stated by Popper, in science agreement with observation does
not amount to the proof of the theory used to successfully describe the experimental data; in fact
experiment can only strictly be used to disprove a theory. We illustrate this herein by discussing a
very diﬀerent theory of gravity in which gravitational forces are caused by inhomogeneities in the
eﬀective in-ﬂow of the quantum-foam substratum, that is space, into matter. We shall show that
this new theory of gravity and General Relativity are mathematically equivalent when it comes to
explaining the operation of the GPS, because of special circumstances prevailing in this case. The
predictive diﬀerences between the two theories become experimentally evident in other situations
such as in the so-called ‘dark matter’ eﬀect, in the observation of absolute motion and ipso facto
in the observation of the in-ﬂow motion into the Sun, and in the observation of a new class of
gravitational waves, and various other known ‘gravitational anomalies’, eﬀects which are present
in existing experimental observations, but are not in General Relativity.

The new theory of gravity arises within the information-theoretic Process Physics1 [2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8]. Here we proceed by showing that both the Newtonian theory of gravity and General
Relativity, in the case of the Schwarzschild metric relevant to the GPS, may be written as in-
ﬂow dynamical systems. A generalisation of these in-ﬂow formalisms is proposed giving the new
theory of gravity. This theory possesses distinct and observable eﬀects already evident in existing
experimental data. However in the case of high spherical symmetry, which is relevant to the
GPS, the new theory of gravity becomes mathematically equivalent to General Relativity with a
Schwarzschild metric, but has a vastly diﬀerent interpretation and ontology. The key insight is
that the dynamical eﬀects of the detectable motion through the quantum-foam substratum causes
relativistic eﬀects and these, together with the quantum-foam in-ﬂow eﬀects, explain the operation
of the GPS.

As discussed in [8] numerous interferometer and non-interferometer experiments have detected
absolute motion of the Solar system in the direction (α = 17.5h, δ = 650) with a speed of 417 ± 40
km/s. This is the velocity after removing the contribution of the Earth’s orbital speed and the
Sun in-ﬂow eﬀect. It is signiﬁcant that this velocity is diﬀerent to that associated with the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) relative to which the Solar system has a speed of 369 km/s in
the direction (α = 11.20h, δ = −7.220), see [9]. As well the experimental data also reveals an
in-ﬂow of space past the Earth towards the Sun. It needs to be emphasised that the detection of
absolute motion is fully consistent with the well known special relativity eﬀects, and indeed these
eﬀects, namely time dilations and length contractions, are needed to understand the operation
in particular of the Michelson interferometer, which formed the basis of several key experiments.
The major insight is that absolute motion through the quantum foam substratum is the cause of
the special relativistic eﬀects. The detection of this absolute motion is evidence that space has
structure though the scale of that structure is not revealed by the experiments analysed in [8].

2 Newtonian Inﬂow

We begin here the analysis that will lead to the new theory and explanation of gravity. In this
theory gravitational eﬀects are caused solely by an inhomogeneous ﬂow of the quantum foam. This

is not a ﬂow through space, but essentially a rearrangement of the quantum-foam which globally is
most easily described as a ﬂow. This is a subtle aspect of this new physics. The new information-
theoretic concepts underlying this physics were discussed in [2]. Essentially matter eﬀectively acts
as a ‘sink’ for that quantum foam. To begin with it should be noted that even Newtonian theory of
gravity is suggestive of a ﬂow explanation of gravity. In that theory the gravitational acceleration
g is determined by the matter density ρ according to

∇.g = −4πGρ.

For ∇ × g = 0 this gravitational acceleration g may be written as the gradient of the gravitational
potential Φ,

g = −∇Φ,
(2)
where the gravitational potential is now determined by ∇2Φ = 4πGρ. Here, as usual, G is the
gravitational constant. Now as ρ ≥ 0 we can choose to have Φ ≤ 0 everywhere if Φ → 0 at inﬁnity.
So we can introduce v2 = −2Φ ≥ 0 where v is some velocity vector ﬁeld. Here the value of v2 is
speciﬁed, but not the direction of v. Then

g =

∇(v2) = (v.∇)v + v × (∇ × v).

1
2

For irrotational ﬂow ∇ × v = 0. Then g is the usual Euler expression for the acceleration of a ﬂuid
element in a time-independent or stationary ﬂuid ﬂow. If the ﬂow is time dependent the Euler
expression suggests the extra time-dependent term in

This equation is then to be accompanied by the ‘Newtonian equation’ for the ﬂow ﬁeld

g = (v.∇)v + v × (∇ × v) +

∂v
∂t

.

∇2(v2) = −4πGρ.

1
2

While this hints at a ﬂuid ﬂow interpretation of Newtonian gravity the fact that the direction of
v is not speciﬁed by (5) suggests that some generalisation is to be expected in which the direction
of v is speciﬁed. Of course within the ﬂuid ﬂow interpretation (4) and (5) are together equivalent
to the Universal Inverse Square Law for Gravity. Indeed for a spherically symmetric distribution
of matter of total mass M the velocity ﬁeld outside of the matter

satisﬁes (5) and reproduces the inverse square law form for g using (4):

The in-ﬂow direction −ˆr in (6) may be replaced by any other direction, in which case however the
direction of g in (7) remains radial.

Of the many new eﬀects predicted by the generalisation of (5), see section 8, one is that this
‘Inverse Square Law’ is only valid outside of spherically symmetric matter systems. Then, for
example, the ‘Inverse Square Law’ is expected to be inapplicable to spiral galaxies. The incorrect
assumption of the universal validity of this law led to the notion of ‘dark matter’ in order to
reconcile the faster observed rotation velocities of matter within such galaxies compared to that
predicted by the above law.

3 Quantum Foam In-Flow

To arrive at the new in-ﬂow theory of gravity we require that the velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) be speciﬁed
and measurable with respect to a suitable frame of reference. We shall use the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) frame of reference for that purpose [9]; see also section 14. Then an ‘object’
has velocity v0(t) = dr0(t)/dt with respect to that CMB frame, where r0(t) is the position of the
object wrt that frame. We then deﬁne

vR(t) = v0(t) − v(r0(t), t),

(8)

as the velocity of the object relative to the quantum foam at the location of the object.

Process Physics leads to the Lorentzian interpretation of so called ‘relativistic eﬀects’. This
means that the speed of light is only ‘c’ wrt the quantum-foam system, and that time dilation eﬀects
for clocks and length contraction eﬀects for rods are caused by the motion of clocks and rods relative
to the quantum foam. So these eﬀects are real dynamical eﬀects caused by the quantum foam. We
conjecture that the path of an object through an inhomogeneous and time-varying quantum-foam
is determined by a variational principle, namely the path r0(t) minimises the travel time (for early
investigations of the in-ﬂow approach to gravity see Ives [10] and Kirkwood [11, 12]),

which agrees with the ‘Newtonian’ form (4) for zero vorticity (∇ × v = 0). Hence (14) is a
generalisation of (4) to include Lorentzian dynamical eﬀects, for in (14) we can multiply both sides
by the rest mass m0 of the object, and then (14) involves

the so called ‘relativistic’ mass, and (14) acquires the form

where F is an eﬀective ‘force’ caused by the inhomogeneities and time-variation of the ﬂow. This
is essentially Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion in the case of gravity only. That m0 cancels is the
equivalence principle, and which acquires a simple explanation in terms of the ﬂow. Note that the

occurrence of 1/

to horizon eﬀects wherever |v| = c: the region where |v| < c is inaccessible from the region where
|v| > c. Also (9), in conjunction with (50), is easily used to show that the new theory of gravity
agrees with that of General Relativity for the operation of the GPS satellite navigation system,
when the in-ﬂow is given by (6); see section 12.

Equation (9) involves various absolute quantities such as the absolute velocity of an object
relative to the quantum foam and the absolute speed c also relative to the foam, and of course
absolute velocities are excluded from the General Relativity (GR) formalism. However (9) gives

which is the Panlev´e-Gullstrand [13, 14] form of the metric gµν for GR. All of the above is very
suggestive that useful information for the ﬂow dynamics may be obtained from GR by restricting
the choice of metric to the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form. We emphasize that the absolute velocity vR
has been measured, see [2, 8] and so this in-ﬂow theory of gravity is no longer speculative.

4 Apparent Invariance of c

The quantum foam induces actual dynamical time dilations and length contractions in agreement
with the Lorentz interpretation of special relativistic eﬀects. As a consequence of this observers

6

in uniform motion ‘through’ the foam will on measurement of the speed of light obtain always the
same numerical value c, so long as they do not adjust their observational data to take account
of these dynamical eﬀects. So the special relativistic eﬀects are very much an aspect of physical
reality, but nevertheless the absolute motion causing these eﬀects is observable.

To see this explicitly consider how various observers P, P ′, .. moving with diﬀerent speeds
through the foam, might measure the speed of light. They each acquire a standard rod and
an accompanying standardised clock. That means that these standard rods would agree if they
were brought together, and at rest with respect to the quantum foam they would all have length
∆l0, and similarly for the clocks. Observer P and accompanying rod are both moving at speed
vR relative to the quantum foam, with the rod longitudinal to that motion, for simplicity. P then
measures the time ∆tR, with the clock at end A of the rod, for a light pulse to travel from end A
to the other end B and back again to A. The light travels at speed c relative to the quantum-foam.
Let the time taken for the light pulse to travel from A → B be tAB and from B → A be tBA, as
measured by a clock at rest with respect to the quantum foam. The length of the rod moving at
speed vR is contracted to

In moving from A to B the light must travel an extra distance because the end B travels a distance
vRtAB in this time, thus the total distance that must be traversed is

∆lR = ∆l0r1 −

v2
R
c2 .

ctAB = ∆lR + vRtAB,

ctBA = ∆lR − vRtBA.

Similarly on returning from B to A the light must travel the distance

Hence the total travel time ∆t0 is

Because of the time dilation eﬀect for the moving clock

(24)

Then for the moving observer the speed of light is deﬁned as the distance the observer believes
the light travelled (2∆l0) divided by the travel time according to the accompanying clock (∆tR),
namely 2∆l0/∆tR = c. So the speed vR of the observer through the quantum foam is not revealed
by this procedure, and the observer is erroneously led to the conclusion that the speed of light is
always c. This invariance of c follows from two or more observers in manifest relative motion all
obtaining the same speed c by this procedure. Despite this failure this special eﬀect is actually the
basis of the spacetime measurement protocol. That this protocol is blind to the absolute motion
has led to enormous confusion within physics. However it is possible to overcome the ‘blindness’
of this procedure and to manifestly reveal an observer’s absolute velocity of motion vR. Several
demonstrated techniques were given in [2].

5 The Lorentz Transformation

Here we show that the real dynamical eﬀects of absolute moton results in certain special obser-
vational data being related by the Lorentz transformation. This involves the use of the radar
measurement protocol for acquiring observational space and time data of distant events, and sub-
sequently displaying that data in a spacetime construct. In this protocol the observer records the
time of emission and reception of radar pulses (tr > te) travelling through the space of quantum
foam, and then retrospectively assigns the time and distance of a distant event B according to
(ignoring directional information for simplicity)

TB =

(tr + te), DB =

(tr − te),

(25)

where each observer is now using the same numerical value of c. The event B is then plotted as a
point in an individual geometrical construct by each observer, known as a spacetime record, with
coordinates (DB, TB). This is no diﬀerent to a historian recording events according to some agreed
protocol. We now show that because of this protocol and the quantum foam dynamical eﬀects,
observers will discover on comparing their historical records of the same events that the expression

is an invariant, where TAB = TA − TB and DAB = DA − DB are the diﬀerences in times and

are suﬃciently small compared with the scale of inhomogeneities in the velocity ﬁeld.

travelling at speed c wrt both P and the quantum foam. Event A is when the observers pass, and is also
used to deﬁne zero time for each for convenience.

R = v′

To conﬁrm the invariant nature of the construct in (26) one must pay careful attention to
observational times as distinct from protocol times and distances, and this must be done separately

for each observer. This can be tedious. We now demonstrate this for the situation illustrated in
ﬁgure1.

B is the time of event B according to that clock. Then TB is also the time
that P ′ would compute for event B when correcting for the time-dilation eﬀect, as the speed
R of P ′ through the quantum foam is observable by P ′. Then TB is the ‘common time’ for
v′
event B assigned by both observers. For P ′ we obtain directly, also from (25) and (26), that
B = 0 and T ′

and so the construction (26) is an invariant.

While so far we have only established the invariance of the construct (26) when one of the
observers is at rest wrt to the quantum foam, it follows that for two observers P ′ and P ′′ both
in motion wrt the quantum foam it follows that they also agree on the invariance of (26). This is
easily seen by using the intermediate step of a stationary observer P :

Hence the measurement protocol and Lorentzian eﬀects result in the construction in (26) being
indeed an invariant in general. This is a remarkable and subtle result. For Einstein this invariance
was a fundamental assumption, but here it is a derived result, but one which is nevertheless
deeply misleading. Explicitly indicating small quantities by ∆ preﬁxes, and on comparing records
retrospectively, an ensemble of nearby observers agree on the invariant

for any two nearby events. This implies that their individual patches of spacetime records may
be mapped one into the other merely by a change of coordinates, and that collectively the space-
time patches of all may be represented by one pseudo-Riemannian manifold, where the choice of
coordinates for this manifold is arbitrary, and we ﬁnally arrive at the invariant

with xµ = {T, D1, D2, D3}. For ﬂat metrics (30) is invariant under the well known Lorentz trans-
formation,

determined by using the measurement protocol. The special feature of this mapping between the

p

observer’s spacetime records is that it does not involve the absolute velocity of either observer
relative to the quantum-foam substratum - their absolute velocities. This feature was responsible
for the ﬁrst two assumptions in (33). This feature has caused enormous confusion in physics.
It erroneously suggests that absolute motion is incompatible with relativistic eﬀects - that the
observation of absolute motion must be in conﬂict with the observation of relativistic eﬀects. For
that reason reports of the ongoing detection of absolute motion has been banned in physics for
nearly 100 years. However to the contrary absolute motion and special relativistic eﬀects are both
needed to understand and analyse the extensive experimental data reported in [2, 8]. The key
insight is that absolute motion dynamically causes the time dilation and length contraction eﬀects.
Without absolute motion there would be no special relativistic eﬀects. This insight runs counter
to nearly 100 years of conventional wisdom within physics.

6 The General Relativity Formalism

The General Relativity formalism is well known. It was constructed by Hilbert and Einstein by
amalgamating the special relativity invariance and, in the low speed limit, the Newtonian theory of
gravity. This resulted in the need for the key feature of employing a non-ﬂat spacetime manifold.
The three key assumptions were:

(1) The laws of physics have the same form in all

inertial reference frames.

(2) Light propagates through empty space with a

speed c independent of the speed of the

(a) source or (b) observer.

(3)

In the limit of low speeds the new formalism

should agree with Newtonian gravity.

(33)

The ﬁrst two assumptions, apart from 2(a) which remains completely valid, have restricted
truth in that they refer to the dynamical eﬀects of absolute motion, and how those eﬀects enter
into the description of physical phenomena when not correcting for the eﬀects of the absolute
motion on the observer’s measuring clocks and rods. As we shall see the third assumption is
actually the weakest for we shall see that the Newtonian theory of gravity was formulated under
very special conditions; namely ones of high spherical symmetry. When that symmetry is not
present then Newtonian gravity is ﬂawed. There is abundant experimental evidence to support
this claim. Hence the weakest part of the General Relativity formalism is actually its link to the
Newtonian theory of gravity. Nevertheless there is something that is partially correct within the
formalism for it has passed a number of key tests, albeit with most tests occuring also in cases
of high spherical symmetry, as explained later. And so the ﬂaw in General Relativity like that
of the Newtonian theory has essentially gone unnoticed. Here we analyse the General Relativity
formalism in order to discover which aspect of it is actually responsible for its few successes. We
shall see that in fact in those cases it may be reformulated as an in-ﬂow formalism.

From the above assumptions the equations which specify the metric tensor gµν(x) of the space-

time construct may be found to be

signals. To these we should add the operation of the GPS; see section 12.

which is exactly the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form of the metric gµν [13, 14] in (18) with the velocity
ﬁeld given exactly by the Newtonian form in (6). In which case the trajectory equation (37) of
test objects in the Schwarzschild metric is equivalent to solving (14). Thus the minimisation of
the τ functional in (38) is equivalent to the minimisation of the τ functional in (9). This choice
of coordinates corresponds to a particular frame of reference in which the test object has velocity
vR = v − v0 relative to the in-ﬂow ﬁeld v.

It is conventional wisdom for practitioners in General Relativity to regard the choice of co-
ordinates or frame of reference to be entirely arbitrary and having no physical signiﬁcance: no
observations should be possible that can detect and measure vR. This ‘wisdom’ is based on two

11

beliefs (i) that all attempts to detect vR, namely the detection of absolute motion, have failed, and
that (ii) the existence of absolute motion is incompatible with the many successes of the Special
Theory of Relativity. Both of these beliefs are demonstrably false.

The results in this section suggest, just as for Newtonian gravity, that General Relativity is
nothing more than the dynamical equations for a velocity ﬂow ﬁeld v(r, t), atleast in those cases
where it has been checked.

7 General Relativity In-Flow

Here we extract from General Relativity the in-ﬂow formalism. To do this we must clearly adopt
the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form of the metric gµν as that corresponding to the observable quantum
foam system, namely to an observationally detected special frame of reference. This form for the
metric involves a general velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) where for precision we consider the coordinates r, t
as that of observers at rest with respect to the CMB frame. Note that in this frame v(r, t) is not
necessarily zero, for mass acts as a sink for the ﬂow. We therefore merely substitute the metric

into (34) using (36) and (35). This metric involves the arbitrary time-dependent velocity ﬁeld
v(r, t). This is a very tedious computation and the results below were obtained by using the
symbolic mathematics capabilities of Mathematica. The various components of the Einstein tensor

In vacuum, with Tµν = 0, we ﬁnd from (34) and (43) that Gµν = 0 implies that Gµν = 0. It is then

previous observation that this ‘Newtonian in-ﬂow’ is completely equivalent to the Schwarzschild
metric. That the Scwarzschild metric in (39) is nothing more than the Newtonian inverse square
law (7) in disguise appears to be poorly known. We note that the vacuum equations Gµν = 0 do
not involve the speed of light; it appears only in (43). It is therefore suggested that (43) amounts
to the separation of the measurement protocol, which involves c, from the supposed dynamics
of gravity within the General Relativity formalism, and which does not involve c. However the
details of the vacuum dynamics in (44) have not actually been tested: All the key tests of General
Relativity are now seen to amount to a test only of δτ [x]/δxµ = 0, which is the minimisation of
(9), when the in-ﬂow ﬁeld is given by (43), and which is nothing more than Newtonian gravity.
Of course Newtonian gravity was itself merely based upon observations within the Solar system,
and this may have been too special to have revealed key aspects of gravity. Hence, despite popular
opinion, the General Relativity formalism is apparently based upon rather poor evidence.

8 A New Theory of Gravity

Despite the limited insight into gravity which General Relativity is now seen to amount to, here we
look for possible generalisations of Newtonian gravity and its in-ﬂow interpretation by examining
some of the mathematical structures that have arisen in (44). For the case of zero vorticity
∇ × v = 0 we have Ωij = 0 and also that we may write v = ∇u where u(r, t) is a scalar ﬁeld, and
only one equation is required to determine u. To that end we consider the trace of Gij. Note that
tr(D) = ∇.v, and that

Then using the identity

= (v.∇)(∇.v) +

∂(∇.v)

(v.∇)(∇.v) =

This is seen to be a possible generalisation of the Newtonian equation (5). Note that General
Relativity has suggested exactly the time derivative of the form suggested by the Euler ﬂuid ﬂow
acceleration in (4) (see also (51)), and also the new term C(v) = 1
4 ((trD)2 − tr(D2)). First note
that for the case of the Solar system, with the mass concentrated in one object, namely the Sun, we
see that the in-ﬂow ﬁeld (6) satisﬁes (50) since in this special case C(v) = 0. As we shall see later
the presence of the C term is also well hidden when we consider the Earth’s gravitational eﬀects,
although there are various known anomalies that indicate that a generalisation of Newtonian gravity
is required, see sections 9 and 13. Hence (50) in the case of the Solar system is indistinguishable
from Newtonian gravity, or the Schwarzschild metric within the General Relativity formalism,
so long as we use (9), in being able to determine trajectories of test objects. Hence (50) is
automatically in agreement with most of the so-called checks on Newtonian gravity and later
General Relativity. Note that (50) does not involve the speed of light c, though perhaps the
density on the right hand side (50)) may need a relativistic mass eﬀect. We have not derived (50))

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

from the underlying Quantum Homotopic Field Theory which arises from the information-theoretic
theory in [3], and indeed it is not a consequence of General Relativity, as the G00 equation of (44)
requires that C(v) = 0 in vacuum. Equation (50) at this stage should be regarded as a conjecture
which will permit the exploration of possible quantum-foam physics, at the classical level, and also
allow comparison with experiment.

As well we should comment on two other tests of General Relativity. One is the observed
decay of the orbits of binary pulsars. From (16) with the in-ﬂow (6) it is easily seen that circular
orbits satisfying Kepler’s laws exist. However for elliptical orbits not only is there a precession of
the orbit but the orbit is not stable. On dimensional grounds we would expect a decay rate of
the magnitude observed for binary pulsars. The other test is the prediction of the cosmological
curvature of the universe and associated with the Big Bang. As noted in [3] process physics also
predicts a growing non-ﬂat universe. These cosmological aspects are clearly not included in (50),
which is only applicable to non-cosmological eﬀects.

However one key aspect of (50) should be noted, namely that being a non-linear ﬂuid-ﬂow
dynamical system we would expect the ﬂow to be turbulent, particularly when the matter is not
spherically symmetric or inside even a spherically symmetric distribution of matter, since then the
C(v) term is non-zero and it will drive that turbulence. In [2, 8] we saw that the experiments that
reveal absolute motion also reveal evidence of turbulence.

9 The ‘Dark Matter’ Eﬀect

Because of the C(v) term (50) would predict that the Newtonian inverse square law would not be
applicable to systems such as spiral galaxies, because of their highly non-spherical distribution of
matter. Of course attempts to retain this law, despite its manifest failure, has led to the spurious
introduction of the notion of dark matter within spiral galaxies, and also at larger scales. From

which is (4) for irrotational ﬂow, we see that (50) gives

g =

∇(v2) +

1
2

∂v
∂t

,

∇.g = −4πGρ − C(v),

and taking running time averages to account for turbulence

∇.<g>= −4πGρ− <C(v)>,

(51)

(52)

(53)

and writing the extra term as <C(v)>= 4πGρDM we see that ρDM would act as an eﬀective matter
density, and it is suggested that it is the consequences of this term which have been misinterpreted
as ‘dark matter’. Here we see that this eﬀect is actually the consequence of quantum foam eﬀects
within the new proposed dynamics for gravity, and which becomes apparent particularly in spiral
galaxies. Note that (50) is an equation for v, and now involves the direction of v, unlike the special
case of Newtonian gravity (5). Because ∇ × v = 0 we can write (50) in the form

v(r, t) = v(r, 0) +

(54)

which allows the determination of the time evolution of v.

The new ﬂow dynamics encompassed in (50) thus accounts for most of the known gravitational
phenomena, but will lead to some very clear cut experiments that will distinguish it from the two

14

previous attempts to model gravitation. It turns out that these two attempts were based on some
key ‘accidents’ of history. In the case of the Newtonian modelling of gravity the prime ‘accident’
was of course the Solar system with its high degree of spherical symmetry. In each case we had
test objects, namely the planets, in orbit about the Sun, or we had test object in orbit about the
Earth. So the presence of the C(v) term went unnoticed. In the case of the General Relativity
modelling the prime ‘accident’ was the mis-reporting of the Michelson-Morley experiment, and the
ongoing belief that the so called ‘relativistic eﬀects’ are incompatible with absolute motion. We
shall consider in detail later some further anomalies that might be appropriately explained by this
new modelling of gravity. Of course that the in-ﬂow has been present in various experimental data
is also a signiﬁcant argument for something like (50) to model gravity. Key new experimental
techniques will enable the consequences of (50) to be tested. If necessary these experiments will
provide insights into possible modiﬁcations to (50).

10 Observations of Absolute Motion and Gravitational In-

Flows

An extensive analysis of numerous experimental observations of absolute motion has been reported
in [2, 7, 8]. Absolute motion is motion relative to space itself. It turns out that Michelson and
Morley [15] in their historic experiment of 1887 did detect absolute motion, but rejected their
own ﬁndings because, using a ﬂawed model for the operation of the interferometer, the analysis of
their data led to a speed of some 8 km/s, which was less than the 30 km/s orbital speed of the
Earth. Key aspects missing from their theory were, in addition to the known geometrical eﬀect of
the diﬀerent path lengths when in translation, the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction and the eﬀect
of the gas in slowing the speed of the light (the refractive index eﬀect). The data to the contrary
clearly indicated evidence of absolute motion and, furthermore, that the theory for the operation
of the Michelson interferometer was not adequate. Rather than reaching this conclusion Michelson
and Morley came to the incorrect conclusion that their results amounted to the failure to detect
absolute motion, even though the data clearly showed a signal with the expected signature, namely
an 1800 period on rotating the interferometer. This had an enormous impact on the development
of physics, for as is well known Einstein adopted the absence of absolute motion eﬀects as one of his
fundamental assumptions. By the time Miller [16] had ﬁnally ﬁgured out how to use and properly
analyse data from his Michelson interferometer absolute motion had become a forbidden concept
within physics, as it still is at present. The experimental observations by Miller and others of
absolute motion has continued to be scorned and rejected by the physics community. Fortunately
as well as revealing absolute motion the experimental data also reveals evidence in support of a
new theory of gravity.

In ref.[2, 8] the analysis of data from six experiments demonstrated that absolute motion relative
to space has been observed by Michelson and Morley [15], Miller [16], Illingworth [17], Jaseja et
al [18], Torr and Kolen [19], and by DeWitte [20], contrary to common belief within physics that
absolute motion has never been observed. The Dayton Miller also reveals via the analysis in [8], the
in-ﬂow of space past the Earth into the Sun. The direction of the cosmic absolute velocity is found
to be diﬀerent to that of the CMB due to the in-ﬂow into the Milky Way and the local galactic
cluster, see section 14. The Miller experimental data also suggests that the in-ﬂow manifests
turbulence, as does the De Witte data, which amounts to the observation of a gravitational wave
phenomena.

15

The extensive experimental data shows that absolute motion is consistent with relativistic ef-
fects. Indeed relativistic eﬀects are caused by dynamical eﬀects associated with absolute motion, as
proposed by Lorentz, and relativistic eﬀects are required in understanding the gas-mode Michelson
interferometer experiments. The Lorentz transformation is seen to be a consequence of absolute mo-
tion dynamics. Vacuum Michelson interferometer experiments or its equivalent [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
cannot detect absolute motion, but their null results do support this interpretation and form a
part of the experimental predictions of the new physics.

11 The Superposition Principle

Despite being non-linear (50) possesses a restricted superposition principle, which explains why the
existence of absolute motion and as well the presence of the C(v) term appears to have escaped
attention in the case of gravitational experiments and observations near the Earth, despite the
fact, in the case of the C(v) term, that the presence of the Earth breaks the spherical symmetry
of the matter distribution of the Sun.

First note that if we have a matter distribution ρ(r) at rest in the space of quantum foam, and
that (50) has solution v0(r, t), and then with g0(r, t) given by (51), then when the same matter
distribution is uniformly translating at velocity V, that is ρ(r) → ρ(r − Vt), then a solution to
(50) is

v(r, t) = v0(r − Vt, t) + V.

(55)

This is the superposition principle. Note that this situation is a manifestly time-dependent process
and the time derivative in (4) or (14) and (50) plays an essential role. As well the result is
nontrivial as (50) is a non-linear equation. The solution (55) follows because (i) the expression for
the acceleration g(r, t) gives, and this expression occurs in (50),

g(r, t) =

∂v0(r − Vt, t)

= −(V.∇)v0(r − Vt, t) + g0(r − Vt, t) + (V.∇)v0(r − Vt, t),

(56)

as there is a key cancellation of two terms in (56), and (ii) clearly C(v0(r − Vt, t) + V) = C(v0(r −
Vt, t)), and so this term is also simply translated. Hence apart from the translation eﬀect the
acceleration is the same. Hence the superposition principle in (55), which is a velocity vector
addition rule, is valid for generating the vector ﬂow ﬁeld for the translating matter distribution.
This is why the large absolute motion velocities of some 400 km/s do not interfere with the usual
computation and observation of gravitational forces.

For Earth based gravitational phenomena the motion of the Earth takes place within the
velocity in-ﬂow towards the Sun, and the velocity sum rule (55) is only approximately valid as
now V → V(r, t) and no longer corresponds to uniform translation, and manifests turbulence.
To be a valid approximation the inhomogeneity of V(r, t) must be much smaller than that of
v0(r − Vt, t), which it is, as the Earth’s centripetal acceleration about the Sun is approximately
1/1000 that of the Earth’s gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth. Nevertheless

16

turbulence associated with the C(v) term is apparent in experimental data. The validity of this
approximation demonstrates that the detection of a cosmic absolute motion and the in-ﬂow theory
of gravity are consistent with the older methods of computing gravitational forces. This is why both
the presence of the C(v) term, the in-ﬂow and the absolute motion have gone almost unnoticed in
Earth based gravitational experiments, except for various anomalies; see section 13.

Figure 2: Orbit of Earth about the Sun with tangential orbital velocity vtangent and quantum-foam in-
ﬂow velocity vin. Then vN = vtangent − vin is the velocity of the Earth relative to the quantum foam,
after subtracting vcosmic. Alternatively this diagram also represents the various velocities associated with
a satellite in orbit about the Earth.

For Earth based detectors of absolute motion there are four main velocities that contribute to

the total velocity:

v = vcosmic + vtangent − vin − vE.

(57)

Here vcosmic is the velocity of the Solar system through space, while the other three are local Solar
system eﬀects: (i) vtangent is the tangential orbital velocity of the Earth about the Sun, (ii) vin
is a quantum-gravity radial in-ﬂow of the quantum foam past the Earth towards the Sun, and
(iii) the corresponding quantum-foam in-ﬂow into the Earth is vE and makes no contribution to
a horizontally operated interferometer. In constructing (57) we have asumed the validity ofthe
superposition principle, namely that vin and vE may be approximately combined vectorially. The
minus signs in (57) arise because, for example, the in-ﬂow towards the Sun requires the Earth to
have an outward directed velocity against that in-ﬂow in order to maintain a ﬁxed distance from
the Sun, as shown in ﬁgure 2. For circular orbits vtangent and vin are given by

while the net speed vN of the Earth from the vector sum vN = vtangent − vin is

where M is the mass of the Sun, R is the distance of the Earth from the Sun, and G is Newton’s
gravitational constant. G is essentially a measure of the rate at which matter eﬀectively ‘dissipates’

expressions give vtangent = 30km/s, vin = 42.4km/s and vN = 52km/s.

12 Gravitational In-Flow and the GPS

We show here that the new in-ﬂow theory of gravity together with the observed absolute velocity of
motion of the solar system through space are together compatible with the operation of the Global
Positioning System (GPS). Given the developments above this turns out to be an almost trivial
exercise. As usual in this system the eﬀects of the Sun and Moon are neglected. Various eﬀects
need to be included as the system relies upon extremely accurate atomic clocks in the satellites
forming the GPS constellation. Within both the new theory and General Relativity these clocks
are eﬀected by both their speed and the gravitational eﬀects of the Earth. As well the orbits of
these satellites and the critical time delays of radio signals from the satellites need to be computed.
For the moment we assume spherical symmetry for the Earth. The eﬀects of non-sphericity will
be discussed below. In General Relativity the orbits and signalling time delays are determined
by the use of the geodesic equation (37) and the Schwarzschild metric (39). However these two
equations are equivalent to the orbital equation (16) and the velocity ﬁeld (55), with a velocity
V of absolute motion, and with the in-ﬂow given by (6), noting the result in section 11. For EM
signalling the elapsed time in (9) requires careful treatment. Hence the two systems are completely
mathematically equivalent: the computations within the new system may most easily be considered
by relating them to the mathematically equivalent General Relativity formalism. We can also see
this by explicitly changing from the CMB frame to a non-rotating frame co-moving with the Earth
by means of the change of variables

which lead to the relationships of diﬀerentials

+ V,

∂t′ =

(61)

(62)

These expressions then lead to the demonstration of the invariance of (50). Then in the Earth co-
moving frame the absolute velocity V does not appear in (50). Then another change of variables,
as in (40), permits (50) to be written in the form of General Relativity with a Schwarzschild metric.
The consistency between the absolute motion velocity V and General Relativity may also be

directly checked by showing explictly, using say Mathematica, that the metric

dτ 2 = gµνdxµdxν = dt2 −

1

c2 (dr(t) − ((v(r − Vt) + V)dt)2,

(63)

is a solution to (34) for Tµν = 0, ie outside matter, where v(r) is the in-ﬂow velocity ﬁeld in (6). This
metric is a generalisation of the Panlev´e-Gullstrand metric to include the absolute motion eﬀect.
This emphasises yet again that for a spherically symmetric matter distribution the Schwarzschild
metric, which is equivalent to the Panlev´e-Gullstrand metric, is physically identical to Newtonian
gravity.

18

There are nevertheless two diﬀerences between the two theories. One is their diﬀerent treatment
of the non-sphericity of the Earth via the C(v) term, and the second diﬀerence is the eﬀects of
the in-ﬂow turbulence. In the operation of the GPS the density ρ(r) of the Earth is not used.
Rather the gravitational potential Φ(r) is determined observationally. In the new gravity theory
the determination of such a gravitational potential via (50) and Φ(r) = − 1
2 v2(r) would involve
the extra C(v) term. Hence because of this phenomenological treatment the eﬀects of the C(v)
term are not checkable. However the gravitational wave eﬀect is expected to aﬀect the operation
of the GPS, and the GPS constellation would oﬀer a worldwide network which would enable the
investigation of the spatial and temporal correlations of these gravitational waves.

There is also a signiﬁcant interpretational diﬀerence between the two theories. For example in
General Relativity the relativistic eﬀects involve both the ‘special relativity’ orbital speed eﬀect via
time dilations of the satellite clocks together with the General Relativity ‘gravitational potential
energy’ eﬀect on the satellite clocks. In the new theory there is only one eﬀect, namely the time
dilation eﬀect produced by the motion of the clocks through the quantum foam, and the speeds of
these clocks involves the vector sum of the orbital velocity and the velocity caused by the in-ﬂow
of the quantum foam into the Earth. This is illustrated by ﬁgure 2, where now the orbit refers to
that of a satellite about the Earth.

13 Gravitational Anomalies

Gravitational anomalies are those observed eﬀects which are apparently inconsistent with either
the Newtonian theory of gravity or General Relativity. The ‘dark matter’ eﬀect is in fact one such
anomaly. These anomalies are in the low speed/low mass regime appropriate to the Newtonian
theory, but since General Relativity was constructed to agree with Newtonian theory in this regime
these anomalies are common to both theories. Here we note that these anomalies appear to be
explainable within the new theory of gravity, and are indicators of the failure of Newtonian gravity
and hence General Relativity.

As noted in section 2 Newton’s Inverse Square Law of Gravitation may only be strictly valid
in cases of spherical symmetry. The theory that gravitational eﬀects arise from inhomogeneities
in the quantum foam ﬂow implies that there is no ‘universal law of gravitation’ because the inho-
mogeneities are determined by non-linear ‘ﬂuid equations’ and the solutions have no form which
could be described by a ‘universal law’. Fundamentally there is no generic ﬂuid ﬂow behaviour.
The Inverse Square Law is then only an approximation, with large deviations expected in the case
of spiral galaxies. Nevertheless Newton’s gravitational constant G will have a deﬁnite value as it
quantiﬁes the eﬀective rate at which matter dissipates the information content of space.

From these considerations it follows that the measurement of the value of G will be diﬃcult as
the measurement of the forces between two of more objects, which is the usual method of measuring
G, will depend on the geometry of the spatial positioning of these objects in a way not previously
accounted for because the Newtonian Inverse Square Law has always been assumed, or in some
case a speciﬁed change in the form of the law has been used. But in all cases a ‘law’ has been
assumed, and this may have been the ﬂaw in the analysis of data from such experiments. This
implies that the value of G from such experiments will show some variability as a systematic eﬀect
has been neglected in analysing the experimental data, for in none of these experiments is spherical
symmetry present. So experimental measurements of G should show an unexpected contextuality.
As well the inﬂuence of surrounding matter has also not been properly accounted for. Of course
any eﬀects of turbulence in the inhomogeneities of the ﬂow has presumably also never even been

contemplated. The ﬁrst measurement of G was in 1798 by Cavendish using a torsional balance.
As the precision of experiments increased over the years and a variety of techniques used the
disparity between the values of G has actually increased. Figure 3 shows the results from precision
measurements of G over the last 60 years. As can seen one indication of the contextuality is that
measurements of G produce values that diﬀer by nearly 40 times their individual error estimates.
In 1998 CODATA increased the uncertainty in G from 0.013% to 0.15%. It is predicted that these
G anomalies will only be resolved when the new theory of gravity is used in analysing the data
from these experiments.

There are additional gravitational anomalies that are not well-known in physics, presumably
because their existence is incompatible with the Newtonian or the Hilbert-Einstein gravity theories.
The most signiﬁcant of these anomalies is the Allais eﬀect [50, 51]. In June 1954 Allais reported
that a short Foucault pendulum, known as a paraconical pendulum, exhibited peculiar rates of
precession at the time of a solar eclipse. Allais was recording the precession of the pendulum in
Paris. Coincidently during the 30 day observation period a partial solar eclipse occurred at Paris
on June 30. During the eclipse the precession of the pendulum was seen to be disturbed. Similar

20

results were obtained during another solar eclipse on October 29 1959. There have been other
repeats of the Allais experiment with varying results.

Another anomaly was reported by Saxl and Allen [52] during the solar eclipse of March 7 1970.
Signiﬁcant variations in the period of a torsional pendulum were observed both during the eclipse
and as well in the hours just preceding and just following the eclipse. The eﬀects seem to suggest
that an “apparent wavelike structure has been observed over the course of many years at our
Harvard laboratory”, where the wavelike structure is present and reproducible even in the absence
of an eclipse.

Again Zhou and Huang [53] report various time anomalies occuring during the solar eclipses of

September 23 1987, March 18 1988 and July 22 1990 observed using atomic clocks.

All these anomalies and others not discussed here would suggest that gravity has aspects to it
that are not within the prevailing theories, but that the in-ﬂow theory discussed above might well
provide an explanation, and indeed these anomalies may well provide further phenomena that could
be used to test the new theory. The eﬀects associated with the solar eclipses could presumably
follow from the alignment of the Sun, Moon and the Earth causing enhanced turbulence. The
Saxl and Allen experiment of course suggests, like the other experiments analysed in [8], that the
turbulence is always present. To explore these anomalies detailed numerical studies of (50) are
underway with particular emphasis on the eﬀect of the position of the Moon.

14 Galactic In-ﬂow and the CMB Frame

Absolute motion (AM) of the Solar system has been observed in the direction (α = 17.5h, δ = 650),
up to an overall sign to be sorted out, with a speed of 417 ± 40 km/s. This is the velocity after
removing the contribution of the Earth’s orbital speed and the Sun in-ﬂow eﬀect [2, 8].
It is
signiﬁcant that this velocity is diﬀerent to that associated with the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) relative to which the Solar system has a speed of 369 km/s in the direction (α = 11.20h, δ =
−7.220), see [9]. This CMB velocity is obtained by ﬁnding the preferred frame in which this
thermalised 30K radiation is isotropic, that is by removing the dipole component. The CMB
velocity is a measure of the motion of the Solar system relative to the universe as a whole, or atleast
a shell of the universe some 14Gyrs away, and indeed the near uniformity of that radiation in all
directions demonstrates that we may meaningfully refer to the spatial structure of the universe.
The concept here is that at the time of decoupling of this radiation from matter that matter was
on the whole, apart from small observable ﬂuctuations, at rest with respect to the quantum-foam
system that is space. So the CMB velocity is the motion of the Solar system with respect to
space universally, but not necessarily with respect to the local space. Contributions to this global
CMB velocity arise from the orbital motion of the Earth in the Solar system (this contribution
is apparent in the CMB observational data and is actually removed in the analysis), the orbital
motion of the Solar system within the Milky Way galaxy, giving a speed of some 230 km/s giving
together with local motion of the Solar system in the Milky Way, a net speed of some 250 km/s,
and contributions from the motion of the Milky Way within the local cluster, and so on to perhaps
larger clusters.

On the other hand the AM velocity is a vector sum of this global velocity and the net velocity
associated with the local gravitational in-ﬂows into the Milky Way and into the local cluster. This is
because the observation of the CMB velocity does not pick up the local gravitational in-ﬂows. Only
gravitational lensing could aﬀect that result, and that is an extremely small eﬀect within the Milky

21

Way. If the CMB velocity had been identical to the AM velocity then the in-ﬂow interpretation of
gravity would have been proven wrong. We therefore have three pieces of experimental evidence
for this interpretation (i) the refractive index anomaly discussed previously in connection with the
Miller data, (ii) the turbulence seen in all detections of absolute motion, and now (iii) that the
AM velocity is diﬀerent in both magnitude and direction from that of the CMB velocity.

That the AM and CMB velocities are diﬀerent contributes to the explanation oﬀered herein
for the resolution of the ‘dark matter’ problem. Rather than the galactic velocity anomalies being
caused by undiscovered ‘dark matter’ we see that the in-ﬂow into non spherical galaxies, such as
the spiral Milky Way, will be non-Newtonian. As well it will be interesting to determine, at least
theoretically, the scale of turbulence expected in galactic systems, particularly as the magnitude
of the turbulence seen in the AM velocity is somewhat larger than might be expected from the
Sun in-ﬂow alone. Any theory for the turbulence eﬀect will certainly be checkable within the Solar
system as the time scale of this is suitable for detailed observation.

15 Gravitational Waves

The velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld equation is expected to have solutions possessing turbulence, that is, ﬂuctu-
ations in both the magnitude and direction of the gravitational in-ﬂow component of the velocity
ﬂow-ﬁeld. Indeed all the gas-mode Michelson interferometer experiments and coaxial cable experi-
ments showed evidence of such turbulence. The ﬁrst clear evidence was from the Miller experiment,
as shown in the analysis in [2, 8]. Miller oﬀered no explanation for these ﬂuctuations but in his
analysis of that data he did running time averages. Miller may have in fact have simply interpreted
these ﬂuctuations as purely instrumental eﬀects. While some of these ﬂuctuations may be partially
caused by weather related temperature and pressure variations, the bulk of the ﬂuctuations ap-
pear to be larger than expected from that cause alone. Even the original Michelson-Morley data in
shows variations in the velocity ﬁeld and supports this interpretation. However it is signiﬁcant that
the non-interferometer DeWitte [8] data also shows evidence of turbulence in both the magnitude
and direction of the velocity ﬂow ﬁeld. Just as the DeWitte data agrees with the Miller data for
speeds and directions the magnitude ﬂuctuations are very similar in absolute magnitude.

It therefore becomes clear that there is strong evidence for these ﬂuctuations being evidence of
physical turbulence in the ﬂow ﬁeld. The magnitude of this turbulence appears to be somewhat
larger than that which would be caused by the in-ﬂow of quantum foam towards the Sun, and
indeed following on from section 14 some of this turbulence may be associated with galactic in-ﬂow
into the Milky Way. This in-ﬂow turbulence is a form of gravitational wave and the ability of
gas-mode Michelson interferometers to detect absolute motion means that experimental evidence
of such a wave phenomena has been available for a considerable period of time.

16 Conclusions

Previous analysis [2, 8] of extensive data from both interferometric and non-interferometric experi-
ments has produced distinctive evidence for the existence of a quantum-foam substratum to space.
Eﬀects of motion through this substratum as well as ﬂows related to gravity are evident in this
experimental data. The evidence suggests that in fact the special relativity eﬀects, which are well
established by experiment, are being caused by absolute motion of systems through this quantum
foam that is space. Process Physics in conjunction with this data leads to a new theory of gravity

22

which is shown to be mathematically consistent with the Newtonian and General Relativity theo-
ries in those cases where these theories have been thoroughly tested. The new theory of gravity has
a fundamentally diﬀerent interpretation and ontology. However the new theory of gravity implies
that the Newtonian theory of gravity is only strictly applicable to cases of high spherical symme-
try, and that this limitation of the Newtonian theory was inherited by General Relativity in its
formulation by Hilbert and Einstein. The failure of these theories in cases of highly non-spherical
systems, such as spiral galaxies, has resulted in the spurious introduction of concepts like ‘dark
matter’. However in the case of the Global Positioning System the Earth-satellite system has high
spherical symmetry and in this case the new theory and General Relativity are mathematically
equivalent, and so the obvious success of General Relativity in modelling the quite complex op-
erations of the GPS is also equally applicable to the new gravity theory. The failure of General
Relativity in cases of high non-spherical symmetry implies that the explanation of the operation
oﬀered by General Relativity for the GPS was essentially accidental, and certainly involved an
incorrect interpretation and ontology.

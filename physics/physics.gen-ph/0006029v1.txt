In the space and the time with a fractional dimensions the Lorents transformations fulﬁll only as
a good approach and become exact only when dimensions are integer. So the principle of relativity
(it is exact when dimensions are integer) may be treated also as a good approximation and may
remain valid ( but modiﬁed ) in case of small fractional corrections to integer dimensions of time and
space. In this paper presented the gravitation ﬁeld theory in the fractal time and space (based on the
fractal theory of time and space developed by author early). In the theory are taken into account the
alteration of Lorents transformations for case including v = c and are described the real gravitational
ﬁelds with spin equal 2 in the fractal time deﬁned on the Riemann or Minkowski measure carrier.
In the theory introduced the new ”quasi-spin”, given four equations for gravitational ﬁelds (with
diﬀerent ”quasi spins” and real and imaginary energies). For integer dimensions the theory coincide
with Einstein GR or Logunov- Mestvirichvili gravitation theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

The general relativity theory (GR) [1] is one of the
most known and used the theories of gravitation ﬁeld. It
is elegant, beautiful from physical point of view and ex-
plains all experimental facts (truly, it must be point out
that others gravitational theories explain them too, as
example see [2]). The one of the known lacks of the GR
consists in impossibility to include other physical ﬁelds
(except gravitation ﬁeld) in the frame of GR, i.e. in im-
possibility to look on other ﬁelds as on the characteris-
tics of metric of Riemann geometry. The equations of
GR based on assumption that all systems of frame are
equivalent, the absolute systems of references are absent
thou the space and the time in the presence of gravita-
tional ﬁelds are inhomogeneous. In the fractal theory of
time and space ( see [3]- [16]) all the physical ﬁelds are
included in the fractional dimensions of the time and the
space, the time and the space ﬁelds are real ﬁelds and
any system of frames are an absolute system of frame,
the Lorents transformations and known physical laws ful-
ﬁlled as not rigorously laws and are only very good ap-
proach for describing characteristics of the time and the
space. For the case when fractional corrections to integer
dimensions are small all the equations of the fractal the-
ory practically coincide with equations of known physical
theories or may give only non-suﬃcient corrections. Here
we present the theory for the ﬁelds with spin equal two
in the fractal time and space on the base of the equa-
tions given in [3], [4], [14] ( in the paper [14] used the
modiﬁed Lorents transformations with corrections given
by the fractal theory of time for moving with speed of
light( [5]- [6]) for constructing the theories of scalar, vec-
tor and spinor ﬁeld). The equation of this theory diﬀers

1

from equations of the theories [12], [3] because the mod-
iﬁed Lorents transformations give four systems of grav-
itational equations for four diﬀerent gravitational ﬁelds
(two with real energies and two with imaginary energies)
instead of only one system in theories [1], [2].

II. GENERALIZED FRACTIONAL DERIVATIVES

Following [3]- [4], we will consider both time and space
as the initial real material ﬁelds existing in the world and
generating all other physical ﬁelds by means of their frac-
tional dimensions. For the gravitational ﬁelds equations
construction may be used the principle of minimum frac-
tal dimensions functional as it was made in [3]- [4]. The
aim of the paper is to include (in addition to Lagrangians
used in [3], [4]) in Lagrangians of ﬁelds the additional
members that give corrections to Lorents transformations
[5], [6], [14] in the domain of velocities v ≃ c. For de-
scribing the functions deﬁned on multifractal sets it is
necessary to introduce the generalized fractional deriva-
tives (see [5], [6], [9]). Therefore, we introduce as in the
cited papers the integral functionals (both left-sided and
right-sided) which are suitable to describe the dynamics
of functions deﬁned on multifractal sets of time and space
(generalized fractional derivatives (GFD), see [3]- [4], [9])
and replace by GFD the usual derivatives and integral
respect to time and space coordinates in the fractional
dimensions functional. These functionals GFD are sim-
ple and natural generalization of the Riemann-Liouville
fractional derivatives and integrals:

+,tf (t) = (cid:18) d

(2)

where Γ(x) is Euler’s gamma function, and a and b are
some constants from [0,∞). In these deﬁnitions, as usu-
ally, n = {d} + 1 ,where {d} is the integer part of d if
If
d ≥ 0 (i.e. n − 1 ≤ d < n) and n = 0 for d < 0.
d = const, the generalized fractional derivatives (GFD)
(1)-(2) coincide with the Riemann - Liouville fractional
derivatives (d ≥ 0) or fractional integrals (d < 0). When
d = n + ε(t), ε(t) → 0, GFD can be represented by means
of integer derivatives and integrals. There are relations
between GFD and ordinary derivatives for dα near in-
teger values.
If dα → n where n is an integer , ( for
example dα=1 + ε(r, (t), t), α = r, t), in that case it is
possible represent GFD by approximate relations (see [3],
[9])

with speed of light in the special relativity theory as the
result of the requirement of rigorous validity of the con-
servation laws in the presence of physical ﬁelds that is
valid only for closed systems.
In our theory there are
an approximate fulﬁllment of conservation laws as in the
fractal theory of time and space the Universe is treated
as an open system deﬁned on the measure carrier (the
closed system is the Universe together with the measure
carrier).
The gravitational equations may be received by using the
principle of minimum to functional of fractal dimensions
with dependencies of GFD ( [3], [4]) or by replacing the
ordinary derivatives in proper physical equations by GFD
( [12]) (the results will be the same). In this paper we
generalize the theory of gravitational ﬁelds [3], [4], [12]
by including in the equations received in these papers the
results of paper [14] that took into account the modiﬁed
Lorents transformations.

where a is constant and deﬁned by the choice of the rules
of regularization of integrals (1)-(2) (for more detail see
[3], [4], [9]). The selection of the rule of regularization
that gives a real additives for usual derivative in (3) yield
a = 0.5 for d < 1 and a = 1.077 for d > 1 [3]. The
functions under integral sign in (1)-(2) we consider as
the generalized functions deﬁned on the set of the ﬁnite
functions [18]. The notions of GFD, similar to (1)-(2),
also deﬁned and for the space variables r.
In the deﬁnitions of GFD (1)-(2) the connections between
fractal dimensions of time dt(r(t), t) and characteristics
of physical ﬁelds (say, potentials Φi(r(t), t), i = 1, 2, ..)
or densities of Lagrangians Li) are determined, following
[3], by the relation

where Li are densities of energy of physical ﬁelds, βi are
dimensional constants with physical dimension of [Li]−1
i = a−1βi for the
(it is worth to choose β′
sake of independence from regularization constant). The
deﬁnition of time as the system of subsets and deﬁni-
tion the FD d (see ( 5)) connects the value of fractional
(fractal) dimension dt(r(t), t) with each time instant t.
Thus dt depends both on time t and coordinates r.
If
dt = 1 (the absence of physical ﬁelds) the set of time has
topological dimension equal to unity. The multifractal
model of time allows, as will be shown early ( [5], [6])
, to consider the divergence of energy of masses moving

For generalization of the gravitational ﬁeld theory pre-
sented in [3], [4] by means of construction the equations
in the fractal time and space with modiﬁed Lorents trans-
formations we write at ﬁrst the ﬁeld equations for scalar
function Φ of paper [14]

where 2 is D’Alamber operator (2 = ∆ − ∂ 2

Laplasian), Φ are functions describing particles or ﬁelds.
For scalar Φ equation (6) describes the scalar ﬁeld in the
space with fractal dimensions of time that originate the
all physical ﬁelds (a0 6= 0) . The corrections in (6) to the
usual D’Alamber equation are the result of modifying
the Lorentz transformations. The last is consequences of
fractal nature of time. Now we may write the equations
with taken into account both phenomenon: the inﬂuences
of multifractal structure of time ( use in the equations
the generalized Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives
(GFD) instead of ordinary derivatives) and corrections
to equations from modiﬁed Lorents transformations re-
ceived in [14].
In that case the equation (6) take the
form

and I is the 4-component unit matrix. This situation is
the same as for vector, spinor or Proca ﬁelds described
in the [14].

IV. THE SELECTION OF THE MODELS OF

GRAVITY

The generalization of gravitational theory in fractal
space on the base of equations (8) is possible by using
the two models of describing the gravity ﬁelds :

a) The ﬁrst model based on Einstein representations the
space-time as the continuous set of points described by
Riemannian geometry. In that case in the fractal theory
of time and space the measure carrier must be deﬁned
as the Riemannian sets with integer dimensions. On this
sets we construct the fractal sets of time and space with
dimensions deﬁned by Lagrangians densities of energy for
all physical ﬁelds (see (5) ). On the fractal sets the laws
of physics will broken because of the sets of space and
time become the open systems (see statistical theory of
open system in [?] ) connected with the measure carrier.
An arbitrary theories for any physical ﬁelds will include
(in the fractal space) the inﬂuences of Riemannian geom-
etry because of Riemannian carrier of measure. So the
Riemannian geometry of ﬁelds will be not consequences
of characteristics of ﬁelds (for example, gravitational ﬁeld
with spin equal two), but characteristics of measure car-
rier. In that case we may describe the gravitational ﬁeld
(if take into account the inﬂuences of all physical ﬁelds
on behaviour of gravitational ﬁeld) by using the principle
of minimum of fractal dimensions functional and Euler
equations with generalized fractional derivatives (GFD)
as we introduced in the equations of paper [3], [4], [12].
In this model it is necessary to use the covariant deriva-
tives in the fractal Riemannian time-space as it was made
in [3], [12] and improve them by introducing the four
equations for the gravitational ﬁeld tensor Φµν and in-
troducing the corrections from modiﬁed Lorents trans-
formations (the introducing of the last corrections was
demonstrated above). In that case the new gravitational
equations will describe four ﬁelds: the two gravitational
ﬁelds with real energies (if use the analogy with Dirac

3

theory these ﬁelds may have diﬀerent sign of the grav-
itational charges) and the two gravitational ﬁelds with
imaginary energies . All these ﬁelds exist in the Riemann
time-space with fractal dimensions. In the case of inte-
ger dimensions of time and space the received equations
(and the theory) coincide with equations of ordinary GR.
In this paper we consider also the another gravity model
with more analogy to Logunov-Mestvirichvili model of
gravity [2].

b) The second model for describing the gravitation ﬁelds
in the fractal time and space ( by GFD using ) consists
in the selection of other the measure carrier. The selec-
tion the measure carrier is: the measure carrier selected
as the ﬂat four-dimensions pseudo Euclidean Minkowski
time-space. Our fractal Universe in that case deﬁned as
the multifractal sets on the pseudo Euclidean Minkowski
time-space ( the model of a measure carrier selection in
the case a) was the model of Riemannian time-space).
Let us select (as a base) the system of reference which
coincide for FD equal to unit with Cartesian system of
reference (we remind that in the fractal theory of time
and space there are only an absolute systems of reference
but if FD of time and space near integer the principle of
equivalence of all reference systems is valid with grate ex-
actness ). The equations of the gravitation ﬁelds in that
case will be similar to the equations of the theory [2] in
which all derivatives replaced on GFD and metric tensor
γµν are contained the functions (functionals) originated
by fractional dimensions (i.e.
it must be the function
of L where L is Lagrangians energy densities of gravita-
tion ﬁelds). Beside these corrections must be taken into
account the corrections (the main corrections) from mod-
ifying of Lorents transformations and the presence as re-
sult of it of four sorts of the gravitational ﬁelds (two with
real and two with imaginary energies). The diﬀerences
the theory of gravitation based on above statements from
the theory [2] in that case are: 1) the real gravitational
ﬁelds in the theory originated by fractional dimensions of
time, but not postulated as in [2]; 2) the ordinary deriva-
tives replaced by GFD for taking into account the FD
of time; 3) we took into account also the modiﬁcation of
Lorents transformations for time with fractional dimen-
sions; 4) the time-space is fractal and only the measure
carrier is Minkowski time-space with integer dimensions..

V. THE GRAVITATIONAL EQUATIONS

DEFINED ON MINKOWSKI TIME-SPACE

MEASURE CARRIER

It is convenient to use the designations of the theory [2]
for the equations construction of gravitation fractal the-
ory in the multifractal Universe deﬁned on the pseudo
Euclidean Minkowski time-space (this space may have
any dimensions but integer). The equations for gravita-

tion ﬁeld tensor ˜Φµν = √−γ · Φµν (γ = det(γµν ), ˜tµν =

√−γ · tµν , L - is a Lagrangians density of physical ﬁelds

(see in details [2], [3])) have form

The metric tensor γαβ is a function (or functional) of
the tensors of gravitational ﬁelds ˜Φµν and deﬁned on the
fractal pseudo Euclidean Minkowski time-space. These
dependencies the γαβ from ˜Φµν originated by dependen-
cies the interval dS2 from ˜Φµν because the last in the
fractal Minkowski space has the complicated form (see
[3]) and may be expand in powers of ˜Φµν . For expansion
γµν in powers of ˜Φµν obtain

αβ are coeﬃcients of expansion and depend at

distances from center of gravity r0 (r0 << r) to limit
oneself by two ﬁrst members of (11) we may write

γµν( ˜Φαβ) ≈ γµν + ˜Φµν

The equation (10) describes the boundary conditions for
˜Φµν on the Universe surface and b is a mass of gravi-
ton and play role of parameter expanding the domain of
existence of GFD.

VI. GRAVITATIONAL FIELDS DEFINED ON

where b is a constant value that necessary to introduce for
using more broad sets of functions with GFD and it after
calculations must be put zero. The Φµν is a four column
matrix. So we have again four equations for gravitational
ﬁelds with real and imaginary energies. The equation for
curvature tensor (with GFD ) have an usual form, but it
will be four equations for diﬀerent the curvature tensors

tions in the covariant derivatives from fractal nature of

Let us see what diﬀerences between very similar equa-
tions (9) and (14). The equation (9) diﬀers from equation
(14) based on the Riemannian measure by three aspects:
a) the metric tensor γµν in (9) determined on the
Minkowski space with fractional dimensions;
b) equations diﬀers by dependencies of metrics tensor γµν
from L ( because in the (9) there are no dependencies in
the γµν from L originated by the Riemann metric ten-
sor), there are only dependencies originating by FD;
c) the reason of appearance in equation (9) of the depen-
dencies the γµν at L lay in the originate it by the only
fractal dimensions of time and space. If FD are integer
the (9) coincide with equation of the theory [2]. If FD
integer in (14) these equations coincide with equations
of GR. For weak ﬁelds GFD may be represented only by
FD covariant derivatives (only two members in the right
part of (11)) and in that case (9) may be represented by
metric tensor gµν of an ”eﬀective” Riemann space with
integer dimensions as in [2] (see also [3]). So (9) gives

the equations GR too. We pay attention that the corre-
sponding results of the theory [2] for connections between
metric tensor γµν of Minkowski space with ”eﬀective”
metric tensor gµν of Riemann space and gravitation ten-
sor (thou they are valid) are the special case of our the-
ory. In general case the metric tensor of Minkowski space
are complicated function of gravitation ﬁeld tensor. We
took into account the alterations in equations originated
by modiﬁed Lorents transformations in models with both
measures (Riemann and Minkowski).

VII. CONCLUSION

In this paper we considered the two models of grav-
ity theories deﬁned on the multifractal sets of time and
space. From our point of view there are two main ap-
proach to theories of gravity: the ﬁrst is the approach
of Einstein’s theory in which the gravitation ﬁelds and
forces are no exist and its role play the curvature of the
Riemannian time-space originated by Riemannian geom-
etry. The second approach is the approach of postulat-
ing the real gravitational ﬁelds and forces made in the
Logunov-Mestvirichvili theory [2]. The last theory treats
the gravity as an usual real ﬁeld in the ﬂat pseudo Eu-
clidean time-space and it is the very attractive feature of
this theory. The results of both theories coincide on the
distances far from the gravitational radius of centre of
gravity. On the distances of order the gravitational ra-
dius (if our Universe is multifractal set of space and time
points deﬁned on the measure carrier) the both theories it
seems are not correct. In the Universe with multifractal
dimensions of time and space on these distances the main
role will play the integral characteristics of GFD and all
equations become not diﬀerential but integral equations
without containing of any inﬁnity. We presented in these
paper the new theory of gravity: gravity theory in the
time and the space with fractional dimensions. This the-
ory use the idea and results of works [3] - [6], [12]- [14]
and take into account the corrections to SR given by the
theory of almost inertial systems in the time with frac-
tional dimensions [13].
In other words this gravitation
theory expand the main results of [14] on the gravita-
tional ﬁelds.

Let us enumerate now the main results the theory pre-
sented in this paper:

1) The theory gives four sorts of diﬀerent gravitation
ﬁelds: two ﬁelds with real energy ( these ﬁelds diﬀers
by the sign of their energies (the ﬁeld for gravitons and
the ﬁeld for anti-gravitons) and two ﬁelds with imaginary
energies. The situation is the same as for vector (elec-
tromagnetic) and spinor (electron-positron) ﬁelds consid-
ered in [14];

2) The interactions for each of both ﬁelds with real en-

ergies with imaginary energies ﬁelds are diﬀerent. This
gives the possibility to introduce the assumption about
existence of new characteristics of gravitational ﬁelds (
”quasi-spin” ) for explaining these facts;

3) The consideration of two models of a measure carriers
( the measure on Riemannian space and the measure on
Minkowski space) are made.

4) The presented theory coincide with GR or the the-
ory Logunov-Mestvirichvili for case when FD of time and
space become integer.

5) In the fractal time and space the ordinary derivatives
and integral must be replaced by GFD. So the main idea
of this work may be used for generalization of all gravita-
tional theories not considered here , including quantum
theories of gravitation.

6) In this paper adopted the point of view: our Universe
is multifractal sets of time and space ”points” (see de-
tails in the [3]- [4]). As any multifractal set it deﬁned on
a measure carrier. Thus the Universe is an open system
(statistical theory of open systems see in the [19], [20])
and the all physical conservation laws (energy, mass and
so on) fulﬁll as the very good approach. The exact the
conservation laws fulﬁll only for closed system: the Uni-
verse plus the measure carrier. So the correct selection
of measure is a very serious task and it is the task of near
future. In the domains of Universe where the correction
to integer time and space dimensions are very small (in
such domain of Universe we live and such domains are
in distances far away from gravitational radius) the ex-
change by energy, mass, momentum and so on between
the Universe and the measure carrier is very small too
and it may be neglected. It is necessary nevertheless re-
member about continuous exchange by energy between
Universe and the measure carrier ( absorption and emis-
sion of energy) in every place of our Universe in the frame
of presented fractal theory. The Universe never lost its
energy it seems in that case and the far energy future of
Universe is not so sad.

(7) In this paper we considered the characteristics of
gravitational ﬁelds (characteristics electromagnetic and
electron-positron ﬁelds were considered in [14]. Naturally
the algorithm used in the paper may be applied to any
ﬁelds (electro-weak, Lee-Yang, quarks and so on) in do-
mains where the fractional correction to the dimensions
of time are small. In that case will be true the main re-
sults of this paper: every physical ﬁelds must be replaced
by four ﬁelds with the real and imaginary energies. So it
seems very likely that all physical ﬁelds must have their
imaginary twins (if our Universe is fractal).

8) Nobody knows what the time and the space dimen-
sions has our Universe.
If the dimensions of time and
space are fractional the presented in this paper the the-

5

ories of gravitational ﬁelds will be true ( if at least one
of the selections the measures carrier are valid) and will
describe the reality of our Universe. As was stressed in
[13] the one of methods of veriﬁcation the fractal the-
ory of time and space is to accelerate the charge particle
to speed of light that in the time with fractional dimen-
sions is possible (because for spaces with FD of time the
SR was modiﬁed in the narrow domain of velocities near
velocity of light (see [5]- [6] ) .

Abstract

If we consider that some fundamental laws of Physics are same in all inertial frames, it is found
that the velocity of any signal is constant where signal is that using which we perform all (not
partial) measurements of all physical quantities related with an experiment. Instead of the signal
as light in vacuum we may think of another signal say light in water which may be used for all
measurements for a few experiments. We have proposed one experiment to show that if indeed all
measurements in that experiment are done by using signal as light in water then the velocity of
light in water will be measured to be same in diﬀerent inertial frames. Our result naturally tells
that the relationship E = m c2 and others as derived in Special theory of relativity will change if
one uses another signal for all measurements related with the experiment. Experiments on e+e−
annihilation and cosmic muon decay in the atmosphere using light in a medium as signal may also
give some evidence in support of the work presented here.

Einstein’s Special theory of relativity (STR) takes into account the important fact that
signal velocity is ﬁnite and the measurement of physical quantities in two inertial frames
depends upon this velocity. There are two axioms in Einstein’s STR. One is that the laws
of physics are same in all inertial frames and another is the constancy of velocity of light (in
vacuum) in all inertial frames. Light in vacuum is the signal providing the link between the
measurements of physical quantities in inertial frames. However, one question arises whether
only light in vacuum has a fundamental property that it will be constant in all inertial frames
or is it that one can not ﬁnd any change in any signal velocity by using the signal itself for
the measurements of length and time associated with the measurement of velocity of the
signal.

In this letter we show that any signal velocity remains constant in diﬀerent inertial frames
when we perform all (not partial) measurements corresponding to the experiment by using
the same signal. It is assumed that fundamental laws of physics are same in all inertial frames.
Fundamental laws considered here are that the space and time are homogeneous and space
is isotropic. General transformation of space and time coordinates for two inertial frames
for any signal which is obtained is same as those in special theory of relativity with only
replacement of velocity of light in vacuum in the transformation equations by the velocity of
any signal considered for all measurements of an experiment. At the end we have proposed
one experiment in which light in water has been considered as signal which will be used for all
measurements. If velocity of light in water does not change in another inertial frame (which
we expect from our analysis) then there will be no shift in the interference fringe in this
experiment. Experiments on e+e− annihilation and cosmic muon decay in the atmosphere
using light in a medium as signal may give some evidence in support of the work presented
here.

An event in one inertial frame S is characterized by the coordinates by x, y, z, t and
the same event as observed in another inertial frame S′ is characterized by the coordinates
x′, y′, z′, t′. We consider that space and time are homogeneous and space is isotropic. Let
S′ is moving with velocity v with respect to S along the positive x direction and we assume
that the relative velocity v of the two frames are along x and x′ axes. Let us consider that
the points x = 0 and x′ = 0 coincide when t = 0 and also consider that t′ = 0 then. As
space, time are considered as homogeneous so the transformation equations are linear. As
the x axis coincides always with the x′ axis and as the length of the same rod at rest in
any inertial frames should be same, one can show that y′ = y and z′ = z. Now we have to
ﬁnd only x′ and t′ in terms of the coordinates of the event measured in the S frame. Apart
from considering x = 0 we may consider y = 0 and z = 0 when t = 0 without loosing any
generality in our approach to ﬁnd the transformation equations.

Let us analyse at some non-zero value t = T what is the value of x in the stationary frame
corresponding to moving frame point x′ = 0. According to our consideration at t = 0, point
x = 0 of S frame coincides with x′ = 0 of S′ frame. Also according to our initial consideration
the way S′ is moving for that x′ = 0 point will move with velocity v with respect to x = 0
point in the S frame. So x′ = 0 corresponds to x = v T . Such correspondence is true for any
value of t. Considering this and also taking into account that the transformation should be
linear we can relate x′ with any value of x and t in the stationary frame as

x′ = a (x − vt)

(1)

where a is independent of x and t.

Next we like to analyse at some non-zero value x = X what is the value of t in the
stationary frame corresponding to moving frame time t′ = 0. According to our consideration
for an event occurring at x = 0, the corresponding times in the S frame and S′ frame are
t = 0 and t′ = 0 respectively. To represent the distance X from point x = 0 where event
has occurred we imagine that two rods AB and A′B′ are placed in the S frame and S′ frame
respectively as shown in Fig 1 (a). As observed in the S frame both are of equal length X and
at t = 0 the end points of these rods A and A′ coincide with x = 0 and B and B′ coincides
with x = X. To ﬁnd time at a distance X corresponding to the event occurred at x = 0 and
t = 0 we have to send signal from x = 0 to x = X to get common time for both these points
or to synchronize the two clocks placed at these two points. To synchronize the clocks we
can set the time of the clock at x = X to X/vs when the signal reaches x = X. Here vs is
the signal velocity in the rest frame. According to our imagination it is like sending signal
from one end A to the other end B of the rod in the stationary frame to know t = 0 and
sending signal from one end A′ to the other end B′ of other rod placed in the moving frame
to know t value corresponding to t′ = 0 of the moving frame. Signal starts at t = 0 which is
same as telling signal starts at t′ = 0. When the signal reaches x = X i.e, B of the other end
of the rod the stationary frame observer ﬁnds that his/her signal is yet to cover X distance
in the moving frame at that time i.e, yet to reach the other end B′ of the rod placed in the
moving frame. The time taken by the signal to reach x = X is X/vs. So when signal reaches
B the distance between B and B′ is vX/vs which is shown in Fig 1 (b). The signal in the
stationary frame will need extra time vX/v2
s to cover this distance. So although t = 0 and
t′ = 0 are simultaneous but the signal reaching X distance in two frames as observed by the
s time. So at distance X, t′ = 0
stationary observer is not simultaneous and diﬀers by vX/v2
correspond to t = vX/v2
s in the stationary frame. Such correspondence is true for any other
values of x also. Considering this and and also taking into account that the transformation
should be linear we can relate t′ with any value of t and x in the stationary frame as

where b is independent of x and t.

Using eq. (1) & (2) we can write x in terms of x′ and t′ as

If we look at the inertial frames in the way as S is the moving frame moving with −v velocity
with respect to S′ frame then similar to equation (1) we can write

where a′ is independent of x′ and t′. Comparing this with eq. (3) we ﬁnd that

If we look at the inertial frames in the way as S is the moving frame moving with −v velocity

We show here that the velocities of signal as measured in both S and S′ frame are same.
Let us consider that something is moving with velocity u′ as measured in the S′ frame and
u as measured in the S frame. Then we can write

and

which is the velocity addition rule. If u′ corresponds to signal velocity vs then

So signal velocity is same in S and S′ frames and it can be shown that they are same in all
inertial frames. If u′ = vs then u is also vs but not higher than that. Suppose two signal
velocities vs1 and vs2 are available for our experiments. If vs1 < vs2 then one can see the
change of vs1 in two inertial frames when one uses signal with velocity vs2 although there
will be no change in vs1 when signal with velocity vs1 is used.

Here we obtain the transformation rules for the space and time coordinates in two inertial
frames corresponding to an event for any signal. For that we consider that to make things
physically equivalent the length of the rod which is at rest in S frame and measured in S′
frame should be equal to the length of the same rod which is at rest in the S′ frame and
measured in the S frame. The two ends of the rod is measured at the same time. Say the

length of the rod is of one unit when measured in frame in which it is at rest. Then from
equation (1) corresponding to the ﬁrst measurement it follows that length is a and from
equation (4) corresponding to the second measurement it follows that the length is a′. But
both should be equal for physical equivalence and we write

Using this in eq.(6) we obtain

Using eq. (5), (6), (10) and (15)

Using this in eq. (10) we obtain

So from eqs. (1), (2) (16) and (18) we obtain the general space time transformation rules
for any signal as

and

and

These transformation rules are like STR with only replacement of the velocity of light in
vacuum by the signal velocity vs.

The measurements of physical quantities in S and S′ frames as obtained by using diﬀerent
signals can be related. The measurement of relative velocity between two diﬀerent inertial
frames is independent of the signal which we use. If the observed event is at rest with respect
to say S′ frame then the measurement of x′ and t′ is independent of the signal. So if xvs1
and tvs1 are the space and time coordinates of an event occurred in S′ frame and measured
in S frame by using signal vs1 and if xvs2 and tvs2 are the space and time coordinates of same
event measured in the S frame by using signal vs2 then from eqs. (19) and (20) it follows
that

Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetic ﬁelds remain invariant under the space time
transformations not only for the signal - light in vacuum, but also for any signal we use. It is
because the transformation rule of electric and magnetic ﬁelds between two inertial frames
for any signal velocity are similar with transformation rules of STR with only replacement
of velocity of light in vacuum by the other signal velocity in the transformation rule. Then
there are transformations of space time coordinates also which are present in the Maxwell’s
equations. Considering the Lorentz force on a particle of charge q which is independent of
the signal we use, alongwith transformations of space , time and electric and magnetic ﬁelds
it can be shown in a similar way like STR that Maxwell’s equations remain invariant in other
inertial frames for any signal.

We discuss here how one may experimentally verify whether the velocity of other signal
apart from light in vacuum - say light in water is constant in diﬀerent inertial frames.
The experimental set-up has been shown diagrammatically in Figure 2. There are four
mirrors M1, M2, M3 and M4 among which M1 is partially silvered and all are kept inside
water.Monochromatic light coming from the light source falls on mirror M1 and is then
split into reﬂected and transmitted parts and their directions are shown by arrows. The
transmitted and reﬂected light follows some path where water is ﬂowing and some path
where water is not ﬂowing with respect to the apparatus. We may think that the water
which is ﬂowing with respect to apparatus as the moving frame S′ and the water which is
not ﬂowing with respect to apparatus and the apparatus as rest frame S. Waters in diﬀerent
regions of the apparatus are of same refractive index. Part of light reﬂected at mirror M1
again reﬂects at mirror M4, then mirror M3 and then mirror M2 and ﬁnally reﬂects at M1
again and go to telescope. The telescope and the observer are both inside water. Another
part of light after being transmitted at M1 is reﬂected at M2,then M3 after that M4 and
ﬁnally is transmitted through M1 and go to telescope. So there will be interference due to
optical path diﬀerence of the transmitted and reﬂected beams and fringe will be observed. If
there is change in the velocity of light in water which is ﬂowing with respect to the velocity
of light in water which is not ﬂowing with respect to the apparatus then shift of fringe will be
observed with the variation of the the velocity of water ﬂowing. However, according to our
work as only the light in water of particular refractive index is used in the apparatus as the
signal there should not be any change in the velocity of light in water which is ﬂowing and
so no shift in fringe should be observed. If from the apparatus we remove all water which is
not ﬂowing then the experiment corresponds to the famous experiment of Fizeau in which
fringe shift was observed and is given by the formula

∆N ≈

4ln2vw (n2 − 1)
λcn2

(23)

where 2l is the length of the path in which water is ﬂowing, n is the refractive index of water,
vw is the velocity of water and c is velocity of light in vacuum and λ is the wavelength of
light. Similar to light in a medium one may use sound as signal for all measurements in a
particular experiment and in that case velocity of sound will be same in all inertial frames.
Our work shows that the property that the velocity of light in vacuum remains constant
in all inertial frames is not the property of it only rather in a general way one can tell that
any signal velocity is constant in diﬀerent inertial frames. When we use diﬀerent signal other
than light in vacuum then in all transformation rules of special theory of relativity, velocity

of light c in vacuum is replaced by vs. So it shows that depending on the signal used whose
velocity is vs the energy , momentum relation is given by

where m0 is the rest mass and the mass and energy relation is given by

E = vs

p2 + m2

0v2
s

q

E = mv2
s

So if we perform experiment of mass , energy relation and if whole experimental set-up is
fully covered in a medium where the velocity of light is less than that in vacuum we shall
ﬁnd lesser amount of energy is released from a certain amount of mass in comparison to
the energy released from the same amount of mass in an experiment in vacuum or in an
experiment whose set up is fully covered with a medium where velocity of light is higher
than the earlier medium. This may be veriﬁed in e+e− annihilation in a medium by ﬁnding
the energy of γ-rays. Half life for muon (moving in air) measured in air should be longer
than that predicted by STR as half life of muon moving at velocity v will be

T (v) =

1 − v2/v2
s

s

T0

where T0 is half life of muon at rest. Measuring the attenuation of the cosmic ray muon
beam as it proceeds down the atmosphere one may verify this.

Our work also shows that corresponding to a particular signal there is upper limit of
the velocity which is attainable by a particle or wave but this upper limit varies if one uses
another signal.

Abstract

The physical mechanism of phenomenon is explained as a result of
inequality of forward and reversed processes in optics. The importance of
experimental study of its invariance relation is discussed.

PACS number: 03.75.-b, 32.80.-t

There is rather usual situation in nonlinear optics when a phenomenon has
mathematical description, but clear explanation of its physical mechanism is
absent. Clear physical sense appears if we use the concept of inequality of
forward and reversed processes in optics. Such approach has quite reliable basis
[1].

In this note we shall discuss the situation with explanation of the Bloch
oscillation of ultracold atoms in a vertical optical lattice, formed by two coun-
terpropagating beams [2 - 4]. Under action of gravity the atoms perform a cyclic
motion in the vertical direction. The measurement of oscillating frequency al-
lows a sensitive determination of the acceleration of gravity or forces at the
micrometer length scale.

According to the existing theoretical concept the physical base of the Bloch
oscillations is the polarization interaction of the atoms with the standing opti-
cal wave. The corresponding theoretical description is very complex and non-
intuitive [5, 6]. It gives for the Bloch oscillations frequency following expression:

νB =

mgλ
2h

(1)

where m is the atomic mass, g is the acceleration of gravity, λ is the wavelength
of the light, and h is Planck constant [2].

Below we shall deduce the formula (1) by very simple and quite intuitive
way. We also shall give the alternative physical explanation of origin of the
phenomenon.

When the magneto-optical trap is switched oﬀ, the ultracold atoms start
to fall down under action of the gravity (Fig.1). At the certain moment of
time the Raman optical transition takes place and the atoms receive a double
recoil moment in the opposite direction. The obtained recoil energy (2ER)
allows for atoms to return in the initial point. The amplitude (height) of atomic

oscillations (H) may be deduced from condition ER = h2/2mλ2 = mgH and it
is given by

H =

h2
2m2λ2g

For 88Sr and λ = 532 nm this height equals 3, 66µm or 6, 88λ [2]. For 40K and
λ = 873nm it equals 6, 57µm or 7, 5λ [3,4]. But for 6Li atoms this value should
reach 292µm or 334, 5λ (for λ = 873nm).

The fall time (t) of atoms is related to the height by H = gt2/2 . So, for the

period of oscillations (T) we obtain:

(3)

T = 2t =

2h
mgλ

=

νB

The equations (1) and (3) are identical.

For the explanation of physical origin of atom oscillations we should answer

for two questions:

time?

1) Why does the Raman transition occur only at the certain moment of

2) Why is the Raman recoil momentum directed only in one side?

The answer on these questions is that we deal with a direct manifestation of
a time reversal noninvariance or inequality of forward and reversed processes
in optics. This situation is completely the same as in the case of splitting and
mixing of a photons [7, 8]. Those experimental results clearly show that the
reversed optical process is much more eﬃcient, than the forward one. In our
case the Raman transition, which return the atom into the initial point is the
reversed transition. In contrast, the transition, which recoil pushes the atom
down, is the forward Raman transition. The experimental results show, that
the cross-section of reversed transition exceeds in many orders of magnitude the
cross-section of forward transition.

Because of a recoil energy of Raman transition is ﬁxed, the moment of time

for the reversed transition in the discussed case should be also ﬁxed.

It is clear, that the important task now should be an experimental evaluation
and measurement of a ratio of cross-sections for forward and reversed transitions.
Diﬀerent methods may be used for this goal. The most simple and natural way
is the using of pump-probe method with weak, collinear, copropagating probe
laser pulse. The idea of such experiments was discussed early [9 - 11].
It is
surprising that the results of such simple experiments are absent in literature
till now.

In conclusion, we propose the alternative physical explanation of origin of
atomic Bloch oscillations in an vertical optical lattice. This explanation is based
on the concept of inequality of forward and reversed processes in optics. The
importance of experimental study of the invariance relation of forward and re-
versed transitions is discussed once again.

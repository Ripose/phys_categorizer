Prefae

The present notes ontain some basi materials, physial and mathematial, of the general

formalism for analyzing elementary partiles, whih under the general name of Kinemati-

al Formalism of Elementary Spinning Partiles, I have been working during the last years.

The name kinematial makes referene to its lose relationship with the kinematial group of

spae-time transformations assoiated to the Restrited Relativity Priniple whih a theoretial

framework must neessarily satisfy.

In a ertain sense it is a revision of the basi fundamentals of the Lagrangian formalism

whih leads to Euler-Lagrange equations, Noether's theorem, et., but looking for solutions

whih go through the postulated initial and (cid:28)nal states of the variational formalism. This

produes a lassial formalism whih is going to be expressed in terms of the end point variables

of the dynamial evolution. This formalism is, therefore, loser to the quantum mehanial

dynamial theory and it is through Feynman's path integral approah that we an (cid:28)nd the

bridge between them.

These end point variables, whih I propose to all them kinematial variables, in the ase

of elementary partiles will neessarilly span a homogeneous spae of the kinematial group.

In this way, the kinematial group not only re(cid:29)ets the symmetries of the system.

It also

supplies the neessary variables to desribe elementary matter. It is ruial for the desription

of matter to improve in our knowledge of this kinematial group. In the present notes we shall

deal mainly with the Galilei and Poinaré groups, but the formalism is so general that it an

aomodate any further group we onsider as the basi symmetry group of matter.

The notes pretend to be selfontained and in this way we have inluded at the end of

the (cid:28)rst three hapters some mathematial appendies whih ontain not very well spread

materials. The leture notes are organised as follows. We begin with an enumeration of some

pros and ons the formalism has. Probably the right plae of this setion will be at the end

of the notes as a kind of onlusions and omments. I like to put it (cid:28)rst beause it suggests

many of the features we an (cid:28)nd when analyzing the lassial models and may reate some

provoation in the reader. The remaining materials are olleted into (cid:28)ve hapters whih more

or less will over one leture eah.

We begin with the general Lagrangian formalism just to enhane the role of the kinematial

variables in de(cid:28)ning a onept of elementary partile. Leture two will be devoted to the

analysis of several relativisti and nonrelativisti models, to show how the standard methods

of analyzing symmetries leads to the de(cid:28)nition of the relevant observables. In partiular, we

shall pay attention to the de(cid:28)nition of the spin. The spin, as any other observable, will be

de(cid:28)ned in the lassial ase in terms of the degrees of freedom and their derivatives, and we

shall analyze its mathematial struture.

The next two letures will over the quantization of the formalism and the analysis of some

relativisti and nonrelativisti examples. The separate fourth hapter is devoted to the model

whih satis(cid:28)es Dira's equation. Speial attention is paid to the analysis of Dira's algebra

and its relationship with the lassial observables and to show a geometrial interpretation of

the di(cid:27)erene in hirality between matter and antimatter.

Finally, some physial features whih are related to the spin of the elementary partiles,

are desribed. In some plaes, the letures will be omplemented with numerial simulations

whenever the theoretial solution is not available or very di(cid:30)ult to interpret beause of the

mathematial omplexity.

Pros and ons of the kinematial

formalism

I will present in what follows a kind of general introdution to the kinematial formalism,

in the form of some pros and ons the formalism has, from my point of view, with some

additional omments. There will be probably many more ons than the ones quoted, and the

pros I onsider ould be nonsense for other readers. You will probably put some of the pros in

the ons part. Do it, please. Siene is a olletive job and probably the greatest endeavour of

mankind. Any new proposal needs a thorough analysis to (cid:28)nd its ontraditions. It is the only

way to improve knowledge. I am strongly onvined that the kinematial formalism I propose

has more advantages than previous approahes and it is simpler. It opens new perspetives to

establish a deeper formalism to deal with spinning partiles from the very begining.

Things like the predition of formation of eletromagneti bound pairs of eletrons, the

hiral di(cid:27)erene between partiles and antipartiles or the justi(cid:28)ation of g = 2 by pure

kinematial arguments are su(cid:30)ient, from my point of view, to deserve some time to it, even

to analyze its ontraditions. One feature of the formalism is that it is not (cid:28)nished yet. Another

is that it shows that the spae-time symmetry group of the desribed elementary partiles is

larger than the group we start with. We have to aomplish, and (cid:28)nish, this task.

We aept a variational formalism for desribing the dynamis of elementary partiles.

To be onsistent with the variational statements we have to look for solutions of the orre-

sponding di(cid:27)erential equations, passing through the (cid:28)xed end points. This implies that the

variables whih de(cid:28)ne the end points of the formalism, whih will be alled from now on kine-

matial variables, will play in the lassial ase the same role as the wave funtion in the

quantum formalism, to haraterising the states of the system. Our (cid:28)rst task will be to rewrite

the variational formalism in terms of these kinematial variables. It is for this reason we have

inluded a (cid:28)rst leture about a generalized Lagrangian formalism.

• An elementary partile is by de(cid:28)nition the simplest mehanial system. An elementary

partile an be annihilated but it an never be deformed.

Its intrinsi attributes are

not modi(cid:28)ed by any interation. It has no exited states and therefore all its possible

states are just kinematial modi(cid:28)ations of any one of them. If the state of the partile

hanges it is always possible to (cid:28)nd a new inertial observer who desribes the partile

in the same state as before. In the quantum ase this leads to the onlusion that the

Hilbert spae whih desribes its pure states arries an irreduible representation

of the kinematial group.

In the lassial ase the kinematial Lagrangian spae is a

homogeneous spae of the kinematial group.

• It is the Restrited Relativity Priniple whih haraterizes not only the spae-time

symmetry group of the theory, usually alled the kinematial group, but also whih

supplies the lassial variables to desribe an elementary spinning partile.

• The formalism is independent of the kinematial group. The lassial variables whih

haraterize the kinematial state of the system are not postulated. They are related to

the variables whih haraterize the parameterization of the kinematial group, and the

manifold they span is neessarily a homogeneous spae of the kinematial group.

• There is no need to use Grassmann or spinor variables to haraterize the states of a

lassial elementary spinning partile. If we restrit ourselves to the Galilei or Poinaré

groups, the only and most general variables to haraterize the states of a lassial

elementary partile are the 10 variables t, r, v, α, interpreted respetively as the time,

position of a point where the harge is loated, veloity of this point and (cid:28)nally the

orientation of the system around this point. These variables are in fat, the variables

whih de(cid:28)ne a parametrization of any of the mentioned groups.

• The point partile, either relativisti or non-relativisti, is an elementary partile aord-

ing to this formalism. It is not postulated, it is a onsequene of the formalism. Its

initial and (cid:28)nal states are just haraterized by the kinematial variables t and r . It

is the simplest loalized system the formalism allows to desribe but it represents an

spinless ob jet. It seems that there are no spinless elementary partiles in nature and

therefore the use of spinless point partiles for the desription of physial phenomena

is an approximate one. If the whole formalism of partile physis starts by dealing at

(cid:28)rst with spinless point partiles and afterwards this system is endowed with spin and

other internal properties in some ad ho manner, this will produe a di(cid:27)erent framework

than starting with spinning elementary partiles from the very beginning. There is a

quotation by Albert Einstein that: "Things should be made as simple as possible, but

not simpler."

• The spin is an angular momentum and therefore it is always de(cid:28)ned with respet to some

(cid:28)xed point. This point has to be learly identi(cid:28)ed.

• If we understand as the spin of the eletron as the angular momentum of the eletron

with respet to its enter of mass, then the spin of the eletron is twofold. One part is

related to the rotation of the eletron (α variables and its derivative the angular veloity
ω) and the other to the separation between the position of the harge and the enter of

mass, whih is a di(cid:27)erent point, and its relative orbital motion. This omes from the use

of the v variables and its derivative, the aeleration a. The rotation does not produe

magneti moment. The magneti moment is the result of the motion of the harge around

the enter of mass, so that when the magneti moment is expressed in terms of the total

spin this produes a lear interpretation of the gyromagneti ratio.

• The size and shape of any elementary partile are approximate observables. They are

geometrial aspets whih an be de(cid:28)ned for marosopi ob jets but they loose their

geometrial meaning when talking about elementary partiles.

• The enter of mass of the spinning partile, whih is a very well de(cid:28)ned point from the

lassial point of view, an be related to the Newton-Wigner position operator or to the

CONTENTS

5

position vetor de(cid:28)ned by the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, in the quantum ase.

Dira spin operator is not the angular momentum of the eletron with respet to its

enter of mass. It is the angular momentum with respet to the enter of harge.

• The photon and the harge of the eletron move at the speed of light. This motion is not

altered by any external interation. Only the enter of mass motion is a(cid:27)eted. This is

not ontraditory with speial relativity beause the enter of mass or enter of energy

moves always at a veloity v < c.

• For any inertial observer the harge of the eletron is never at rest and therefore it always

measures magneti moment and eletri dipole moment with respet to the enter of mass.

• In a ertain sense eletromagnetism means speed of light for the arriers of the eletro-

magneti interation and also for the soures of the (cid:28)eld.

• The harge of the eletron is loated at a single point and therefore we have no problems

assoiated to the harge distribution of the extended models. But at the same time it

moves and osillates in a region of radius half Compton's wavelength, where at this sale

quantum phenomena appear.

• In the relativisti ase the most invariant way to de(cid:28)ne the internal struture of the

eletron is preisely to assume that the harge is moving at the speed of light. This

veloity annot be altered by any interation, and therefore this orroborates the idea

that an elementary partile annot be deformed.

• Classial partiles whih move in straight lines at the speed of light are massless partiles
whih rotate around the diretion of motion with the spin S either parallel or antiparallel
to the veloity, but in the same diretion as the angular veloity ω . Spin is invariant

under Poinaré transformations but the angular veloity transforms to produe Doppler

e(cid:27)et. The spin, when quantized, is not restrited.

It an take all greater than zero

values 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . .. The spinless ase is not predited. The energy of the spin 1
ob jet is just S

ω = hν , being ν the frequeny of the rotation of the partile.

·

• Partiles whose harge moves in irles at the speed of light, in a plane orthogonal to
the spin, although the enter of mass is moving below c, satisfy when quantized, Dira's
equation. All of them represent massive harged spin 1/2 partiles. Mass and harge are

unrestrited in this formalism. They are the only systems, predited by this formalism,

whih satisfy Dira equation when quantized.

• Partiles whose harge moves faster than light, although the enter of mass is moving
below c, all of them represent, when quantized, massive harged spin 1 partiles. Mass
and harge are also unrestrited. Is it a plausible desription of lassial massive W ±

bosons?

• Elementary spinning partiles show a lear hirality. One the spin diretion is (cid:28)xed,

the position of the harge of the partile has a de(cid:28)nite diretion of motion, while the

antipartile has the opposite one. They are mirror images of eah other.

• The eletron is just a moving harge whih an also rotate. The eletri and magneti

moment are not intrinsi properties. They are derived observables produed by the sep-

aration between the enter of mass and the position of the harge and the motion of the

harge, respetively. This justi(cid:28)es that quantum eletrodynamis is ompletely deter-

mined by the minimal oupling between the eletron urrent and the external potentials,

and without any anomalous eletri or magneti oupling.

• Dira algebra of 4

×

4 matries is ompletely generated by omplex linear ombination

of 16 linearly independent hermitian matries whih represent very preise observables.

Their real linear ombinations will produe all translation invariant observables of the

eletron. One of them is the unit matrix and the other are 15 traeless hermitian matries

whih represent the following observables: 3 are the spin omponents in the laboratory

frame, other 3 are the spin omponents in the body frame and the remaining 9 are

the 9 omponents of the three unit vetors of the body frame. We must remember

that the elementary partile has as degrees of freedom the position of a point and its

orientation in spae whih an be haraterized by the desription of the body frame.

One the translational degrees of freedom are supressed, by analyzing for instane the

eletron in the enter of mass frame, the orientation observables ompletely haraterize

its translation invariant struture. From the algebrai point of view Dira algebra an

be generated by produts and linear ombinations of any 4 of these 9 omponents of its

body frame.

• When analized the interation between two spinning eletrons di(cid:27)erent proesses an

be desribed aording to the energy involved and the separation between partiles. In

low energy we an desribe elasti sattering and also the possibility of formation of a

spin 1 bound state of two eletrons, provided the energy is below a ertain value, the

spins are parallel and their respetive enter of masses are separated by a distane below

Compton's wavelength. In high energy, for relative veloities of the enter of masses of

the partiles greater than 0.1c, deep inelasti sattering proesses appear, where by deep

we mean that the two harges approah eah other below Compton's wavelength.

• The bound state of two equal harged partiles is metastable. The mass of the system is

greater than the sum of the two masses of the elementary partiles.

• The formalism is omplete in the sense that all Lagrangian systems whose kinematial

spae is a homogeneous spae of the kinematial group an be quantized and the or-

responding Hilbert spae arries a pro jetive unitary irreduible representation of the

kinematial group. All known one-partile wave equations are produed by quantization

of the orresponding Lagrangian models.

• To quantize these systems it is not neessary to use any onstrained Hamiltonian formal-

ism like the one proposed by Dira, beause for every system we have a very well de(cid:28)ned

non-singular Lagrangian, as suggested by Feynman, and the quantization is performed

through Feynman's path integral approah.

• The formalism predits, if P CT invariane is assumed, that the magneti moment and

spin of an elementary partile and its antipartile must neessarily have the same relative

orientation, either parallel or antiparallel. It is postulated that eletrons and positrons

have opposite relative orientation. To my knowledge no lear experimental evidene of

this relative measurement for free eletrons and positrons have ever been performed.

The same thing happens for µ+

and µ−

. All very aurate measurements of g

2 are

preession experiments whih do not disriminate whether spin and magneti moment

are parallel or antiparallel.

• The desription of the eletron an be done in terms of dimensionless variables, so that

the symmetry group of the model is larger than the Poinaré group. Spae-time dila-

tions are among the new symmetries. Beause the desription of the orientation has to

be independent of how we hoose the loal inertial body frame, we have at least, in the

quantum formulation an additional SU(2)

U(1) kinematial group of spae-time trans-

×

formations. What is the physial meaning of the generators of these groups? Although

we started the formalism by assuming Poinaré invariane we (cid:28)nd that the elementary

spinning ob jets it desribes have a larger kinematial group of symmetries. We have

to start again, so that the new group will give us new lassial variables to desribe

more internal struture. But this additional 'internal' struture is related to spae-time

symmetries. Poinaré invariane only desribes mass and spin as intrinsi (observer in-

dependent) properties. It is through the analysis of the Casimir operators of the new

enlarged group that new intrinsi properties ould be de(cid:28)ned. This new group does not

ommute with the Poinaré group so that the enlargement is not simply a diret produt

of the two groups. This has not been ompleted yet.

CONS

• We onsider massive partiles whose harge is moving at the speed of light. The harge

of a massive elementary spinning partile is loated at a point. The lassial system

that when quantized satis(cid:28)es Dira equation is that one whose harge moves at the

speed of light. This is not ontraditory with speial relativity beause no information

is traveling faster than light for distanes greater than Compton's wavelength, whih is

the spatial domain for the quantum phenomena. Energy moves with veloity below c.

This possibility of motion at the speed of light is also ontained in Dira's analysis of the

eletron.

• The harge of a free eletron moves in irles at the speed of light in the enter of

mass frame. It is therefore aelerated and lassial mehanis predits radiation. But

lassial mehanis predits that this internal motion of the harge is stationary, and

therefore quantum mehanis allows nonradiating stationary states. The lassial theory

of radiation has to be revisited and radiation has to be assoiated with the aeleration

of the enter of mass.

• The eletri (cid:28)eld reated by the eletron is neither stati nor Coulomb like. It behaves
like 1/r from the retarded harge position. Nevertheless, the time average value of the

eletri (cid:28)eld over one omplete turn of the harge, is stati and Coulomb like from around

a distane of (cid:28)ve Compton's wavelength from the enter of mass up to in(cid:28)nity and in

any diretion. It does not diverge at the origin where it goes to zero. The instantaneous

eletromagneti energy density in the surroundings of the harge goes like 1/r2
greater than that for the strit Coulomb (cid:28)eld whih goes like 1/r4

.

and is

• The only divergenes of the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld appear in the zitterbewegung plane but
0 and therefore the eletromagneti energy density has

all they go like 1/r when r

→

no divergene there. Although they are promissing features I have not been able for the

moment, to renormalize these lassial models.

• The position of the harge of the eletron satis(cid:28)es a fourth order di(cid:27)erential equation.

This fourth order di(cid:27)erential equation is most di(cid:30)ult to analyze. But it an be separated

in a system of oupled seond order di(cid:27)erential equations for the enter of mass and enter

of harge. One possibility is that we have Newton-like di(cid:27)erential equations for the enter

of mass in terms of the external fore and a harmoni osillator like equations for the

motion of the harge around the enter of mass, and whih is independent of the external

fore, thus on(cid:28)rming the idea that the internal struture is una(cid:27)eted by the interation.

Nevertheless a fourth order di(cid:27)erential equation is the most general di(cid:27)erential equation

a point an satisfy in three-dimensional spae, as derived from Frenet-Serret equations.

External interations on a spinning partile will produe fores and torques.

It will

therefore hange the urvature and torsion of the tra jetory, thus justifying the need of

a fourth order di(cid:27)erential equation.

• It is usually said that a point annot rotate. It is lear that all matter that surround

us moves and rotates. In the usual lassial approah, it seems that the only exeption

are the elementary partiles. It is out of logi that the basi onstituents of matter are

exluded from rotation. Why? This implies that the onsideration of the point partile

(and therefore spinless) as the starting ob jet to build all material systems as is done

in Newtonian mehanis is only an approximate formalism. In our formalism we have

to attah orientation to the point to desribe its possible rotation. And this rotation

ontributes to the spin of the system, although there is another ontribution oming

from the orbital motion of the harge around the enter of mass.

The Lagrangian formalism of generalized systems depending on higher order derivatives

was already worked out by Ostrogradsky.

We shall outline it brie(cid:29)y here, mainly to analyze

1

the generalized Lagrangians not only in terms of the independent degrees of freedom but also

as funtions of what we shall all the kinematial variables of the system, i.e., of the end

point variables of the variational formulation.

Let us onsider a mehanial system of n degrees of freedom, haraterized by a Lagrangian
that depends on time t and on the n essential oordinates qi(t), that represent the n indepen-
dent degrees of freedom, and their derivatives up to a (cid:28)nite order k . Beause we an have

time derivatives of arbitrary order we use a superindex enlosed in brakets to represent the

orresponding k-th derivative, i.e., q(k)

(t) = dkqi(t)/dtk

. The ation funtional is de(cid:28)ned by:

L(t, qi(t), q(1)

i (t), . . . , q(k)

i

(t))dt,

where i = 1, . . . , n. Using a more ompat notation we de(cid:28)ne q(0)

values of the variational priniple some partiular values of time t, the n degrees of freedom qi
and their derivatives up to order k
1, i.e., one order less than the highest derivative of eah
variable qi in the Lagrangian, at both end points of the problem. In other words we an say

1.2 Kinematial variables

In general, the system (1.4) is a system of n ordinary di(cid:27)erential equations of order 2k ,

and thus existene and uniqueness theorems guarantee only the existene of a solution of this

system for the 2kn boundary onditions q(s)
1, at the
initial instant t1 . However the variational problem has been stated by the requirement that

i (t1), i = 1, . . . , n and s = 0, 1, . . . , 2k

−

the solution goes through the two (cid:28)xed endpoints, a ondition that does not guarantee neither

the existene nor the uniqueness of the solution. Nevertheless, let us assume that with the

(cid:28)xed endpoint onditions of the variational problem, q(s)
i (t2), i = 1, . . . , n and
1, at times t1 and t2 , respetively, there exists a solution of (1.4) perhaps non-
s = 0, 1, . . . , k
unique. This implies that the 2kn boundary onditions at time t1 required by the existene

i (t1) and q(s)

−

and uniqueness theorems, an be expressed perhaps in a non-uniform way, as funtions of the

kn onditions at eah of the two endpoints. From now on, we shall onsider systems in whih

this ondition is satis(cid:28)ed. It turns out that a partiular solution passing through these points

will be expressed as a funtion of time with some expliit dependene of the end point values

De(cid:28)nition: The Ation Funtion

of the system along a lassial path is the

value of the ation funtional (1.1) when we introdue in the integrand a partiular

solution (1.5) passing through those endpoints:

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

One the time integration is performed, we see that it will be an expliit funtion of the

kn + 1 variables at the initial instant, q(r)
the orresponding kn + 1 variables at (cid:28)nal time t2 . We write it as

j (t1), r = 0, . . . , k

We thus arrive at the following

De(cid:28)nition: The kinematial variables of the system are the time t and the n
degrees of freedom qi and their time derivatives up to order k
1. The manifold
X they span is the kinematial spae of the system.

The kinematial spae for ordinary Lagrangians is just the on(cid:28)guration spae spanned by

variables qi enlarged with the time variable t. It is usually alled the enlarged on(cid:28)guration

Please remark that we use the same letter A( ) for the ation funtion, followed by normal brakets
ontaining the variables of whih it depends, and for the ation funtional A[ ] whih is followed by squared

brakets to enhane that it is not a funtion but rather a funtional.

spae. But for generalized Lagrangians it also inludes higher order derivatives up to one

order less than the highest derivative. Thus, the ation funtion of a system beomes

a funtion of the values the kinematial variables take at the end points of the

tra jetory, x1 and x2 . From now on we shall onsider systems for whih the ation funtion

is de(cid:28)ned and is a ontinuous and di(cid:27)erentiable funtion of the kinematial variables at the

end points of its possible evolution. This funtion learly has the property A(x, x) = 0.

1.2.1 Replaement of time as evolution parameter

The onstany of speed of light in speial relativity brings spae and time variables on the

same footing. So, the next step is to remove the time observable as the evolution parameter of

the variational formalism and express the evolution as a funtion of some arbitrary parameter

to be hosen properly. Then, let us assume that the tra jetory of the system an be expressed

in parametri form, in terms of some arbitrary evolution parameter τ , {

t(τ ), qi(τ )

}. The

funtional (1.1) an be rewritten in terms of the kinematial variables and their derivatives

and beomes:

[t, q] =

It seems that (1.7) represents the variational problem of a Lagrangian system depending

only on (cid:28)rst order derivatives and of kn + 1 degrees of freedom. However the kinematial

variables, onsidered as generalized oordinates, are not all independent. There exist among

them the following (k

(1.8)

We an also see that the integrand

L is a homogeneous funtion of (cid:28)rst degree as a funtion
of the derivatives of the kinematial variables. In fat, eah time derivative funtion q(s)
i (t)
has been replaed by the quotient ˙q(s−1)
(τ )/ ˙t(τ ) of two derivatives with respet to τ . Even the
b
i = ˙q(k−1)
highest order k-th derivative funtion q(k)
/ ˙t is expressed in terms of the derivatives of
the kinematial variables q(k−1)
and t. Thus the original funtion L is a homogeneous funtion
of zero degree in the derivatives of the kinematial variables. Finally, the last term ˙t(τ ), gives
L the harater of a homogeneous funtion of (cid:28)rst degree. Then, Euler's

i

i

i

to the new de(cid:28)ned

theorem on homogeneous funtions gives rise to the additional relation:

With the above (k
1)n di(cid:27)erentiable onstraints among the kinematial variables (1.8) and
ondition (1.9), it redues to n the number of essential degrees of freedom of the system (1.7).

1.2. KINEMATICAL VARIABLES

This possibility of expressing the Lagrangian as a homogeneous funtion of (cid:28)rst degree of

the derivatives was already onsidered in 1933 by Dira

on aesthetial grounds. It is this

homogeneity of (cid:28)rst degree in terms of the derivatives whih will allow us later to transform

the variational formalism into a geodesi problem on the kinematial spae X , but where the
metri gij(x, ˙x) will be diretion dependent, and thus the partile tra jetory is a geodesi, not

in a Riemannian manifold but rather in a Finsler spae.

Funtion

L is not an expliit funtion of the evolution parameter τ and thus we an see that

the variational problem (1.7), is invariant with respet to any arbitrary hange of evolution

parameter τ .

In fat, if we hange the evolution parameter τ = τ (θ), then the derivative ˙t(τ ) = (dt/dθ)(dθ/dτ )
and ˙q(s)

where one again this last dot means derivation with respet to θ. It turns out that (1.7) an be

1.2.2 Reovering the Lagrangian from the Ation funtion

The formalism thus stated has the advantage that it is independent of the evolution pa-

rameter, and if we want to ome bak to a time evolution desription, we just use our time

as the evolution parameter and make the replaement τ = t, and therefore ˙t = 1. From now

on we shall onsider those systems for whih the evolution an be desribed in a parametri

form, and we shall delete the symbol

over the Lagrangian, whih is understood as written

in terms of the kinematial variables and their (cid:28)rst order derivatives.

If what we know is the ation funtion of any system A(x1, x2), as a funtion of the kine-

b

matial variables at the end points we an proeed onversely and reover the Lagrangian

L(x, ˙x) by the limiting proess:

L(x, ˙x) = lim
y→x

∂A(x, y)
∂yj

˙xj,

(1.11)

where the usual addition onvention on repeated or dummy index j , extended to the whole set

of kinematial variables, has been assumed.

If in (1.7) we onsider two very lose points x1 ≡

x + dx, we have that the ation
funtion A(x, x + dx) = A(x, x + ˙xdτ ) = L(x, ˙x)dτ and making a Taylor expansion of the funtion
A with the ondition A(x, x) = 0 we get (1.11).

CHAPTER 1. LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM

1.3 Generalized Noether's theorem

Noether's analysis for generalized Lagrangian systems also states the following

Theorem:

To every one-parameter group of ontinuous transformations that

transform the ation funtion of the system, leaving dynamial equations invariant,

in the form

A(δgx1, δgx2) = A(x1, x2) + B(x2)δg

B(x1)δg,

and where B(x) is a funtion de(cid:28)ned on the kinematial spae, there is assoiated
a lassial observable N , whih is a onstant of the motion.

Let us assume the existene of a r-parameter ontinuous group of transformations G, of
the enlarged on(cid:28)guration spae (t, qi), that an be extended as a transformation group to
the whole kinematial spae X . Let δg be an in(cid:28)nitesimal element of G with oordinates
δgα, α = 1, . . . , r and its ation on these variables be given by:

t

t′ = t + δt = t + Mα(t, q)δgα,

where Mα and M (0)

obtained in terms of the derivatives of the previous ones, will be funtions of the time t and
of the variables qi and their time derivatives up to order s.

the di(cid:27)erent kinematial variables transform under in(cid:28)nitesimal transformations, and of the

funtions Bα whih, as we shall see below, are related to the exponents of the group G.
Funtions Fi and their time derivatives are homogeneous funtions of zero degree in terms of
the derivatives of the kinematial variables ˙xi

funtions of zero degree in terms of the derivatives of kinematial variables and thus invariant

under arbitrary hanges of evolution parameter.

the ation funtion A(x1, x2) that under the transformation g is hanged into A(x′

is a symmetry group of the system, i.e., the dynamial equations in terms of the variables x′
are the same as those in terms of the variables x, this implies that A(x′

The funtion α will be in general a ontinuous funtion of g and x. This real funtion α(g; x)

If we substitute this funtion ξ(g′, g) into (1.45) we see that it is satis(cid:28)ed identially. For

g′ = g = e, it redues to ξ(e, e) = α(e; x) = 0, and thus ξ is an exponent of G.

It is shown by Levy-Leblond in the previous referene that if X is a homogeneous spae
of G, i.e., if there exists a subgroup H of G suh that X = G/H , then, the exponent ξ is
equivalent to zero on the subgroup H , and gauge funtions for homogeneous spaes beome:

α(g; x) = ξ(g, hx),

(1.32)

where hx is any group element of the oset spae represented by x

G/H .

For the Poinaré group P all its exponents are equivalent to zero and thus the gauge
funtions when X is a homogeneous spae of P are identially zero. Lagrangians of relativisti
systems whose kinematial spaes are homogeneous spaes of P an be taken stritly invariant.
However, the Galilei group G has nontrivial exponents, that are haraterized by a param-
eter m that is interpreted as the total mass of the system, and thus Galilei Lagrangians for

massive systems are not in general invariant under G . In the quantum formalism, the Hilbert

spae of states of a massive nonrelativisti system arries a pro jetive unitary representation

of the Galilei group instead of a true unitary representation.

CHAPTER 1. LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM

1.5 Elementary systems

In Newtonian mehanis the simplest geometrial ob jet is a point of mass m. Starting

with massive points we an onstrut arbitrary systems of any mass and shape, and thus any

distribution of matter. The massive point an be onsidered as the elementary partile of

Newtonian mehanis.

In the modern view of partile physis it orresponds to a spinless

partile. We know that there exist spinning ob jets like eletrons, muons, photons, neutrinos,

quarks and perhaps many others, that an be onsidered as elementary partiles in the sense

that they annot be onsidered as ompound systems of other ob jets. Even more, we do not

(cid:28)nd in Nature any spinless elementary partiles. It is lear that the Newtonian point does

not give aount of the spin struture of partiles and the existene of spin is a fundamental

intrinsi attribute of an elementary partile, whih is laking in Newtonian mehanis, but it

has to be aounted for.

In quantum mehanis, Wigner's work

on the representations of the inhomogeneous

9

Lorentz group provides a very preise mathematial de(cid:28)nition of the onept of elementary

partile. An elementary partile is a quantum mehanial system whose Hilbert spae of

pure states is the representation spae of a pro jetive unitary irreduible representation of the

Poinaré group. Irreduible representations of the Poinaré group are haraterized by two

invariant parameters m and S , the mass and the spin of the system, respetively. By (cid:28)nding

the di(cid:27)erent irreduible representations, we an obtain the quantum desription of massless

and massive partiles of any spin.

The very important expression of the above mathematial de(cid:28)nition, with physial onse-

quenes, lies in the term irreduible. Mathematially it means that the Hilbert spae is an

invariant vetor spae under the group ation and that it has no other invariant subspaes.

But it also means that there are no other states for a single partile than those that an be

obtained by just taking any arbitrary vetor state, form all its possible images in the di(cid:27)erent

inertial frames and (cid:28)nally produe the losure of all (cid:28)nite linear ombinations of these vetors.

We see that starting from a single state and by a simple hange of inertial observer, we

obtain the state of the partile desribed in this new frame. Take the orthogonal part of this

vetor to the previous one and normalize it. Repeat this operation with another kinematial

transformation ating on the same (cid:28)rst state, followed by the orresponding orthonormaliza-

tion proedure, as many times as neessary to (cid:28)nally obtain a omplete orthonormal basis of

the whole Hilbert spae of states. All states in this basis are haraterized by the physial

parameters that de(cid:28)ne the (cid:28)rst state and a ountable olletion of group transformations of

the kinematial group G. And this an be done starting from any arbitrary state.

This idea allows us to de(cid:28)ne a onept of physial equivalene among states of any arbi-

trary quantum mehanial system in the following way: Two states are said to be physially

equivalent if they an produe by the above method an orthonormal basis of the same Hilbert

subspae, or in an equivalent way, if they belong to the same invariant subspae under the

group ation. It is easy to see that this is an equivalene relation. But if the representation is

irreduible, all states are equivalent as basi piees of physial information for desribing the

elementary system. There is one and only one single piee of basi physial information to

desribe an elementary ob jet. That is what the term elementary might mean.

But this de(cid:28)nition of elementary partile is a pure group theoretial one. The only quantum

mehanial ingredient is that the group operates on a Hilbert spae. Then one question arises.

9

see ref.1.

1.5. ELEMENTARY SYSTEMS

21

Can we translate this quantum mehanial de(cid:28)nition into the lassial domain and obtain an

equivalent group theoretial de(cid:28)nition for a lassial elementary partile?

Following with the above idea, in lassial mehanis we have no vetor spae struture

to desribe the states of a system. What we have are manifolds of points where eah point

represents either the on(cid:28)guration state, the kinematial state or the phase state of the system

depending on whih manifold we work. But the idea that any point that represents the state

of an elementary partile is physially equivalent to any other, is in fat the very mathematial

onept of homogeneity of the manifold under the orresponding group ation. In this way,

the irreduibility assumption of the quantum mehanial de(cid:28)nition is translated into the realm

of lassial mehanis in the onept of homogeneity of the orresponding manifold under the

Poinaré group or any other kinematial group we onsider as the symmetry group of the

theory. But, what manifold? Con(cid:28)guration spae? Phase spae? The answer as has been

shown in previous works,

is that the appropriate manifold is the kinematial spae.

10

In the Lagrangian approah of lassial mehanis, the kinematial spae X is the manifold

where the dynamis is developed as an input-output formalism. When quantizing the system we

will obtain the natural link between the lassial and quantum formalisms through Feynman's

path integral approah, as will be shown later. This manifold is the natural spae on whih

to de(cid:28)ne the Hilbert spae struture of the quantized system. In a formal way we an say

that eah point x
X that represents the kinematial state of a system is spread out and
is transformed through Feynman's quantization into the partile wave funtion ψ(x) de(cid:28)ned
around x. This wave funtion is a squared integrable omplex funtion de(cid:28)ned on X .

∈

We an also analyze the elementarity ondition from a di(cid:27)erent point of view. Let us

.

onsider an inertial observer O that is measuring a ertain observable A(τ ) of an arbitrary
system at an instant τ . This observable takes the value A′(τ ) for a di(cid:27)erent inertial observer
O′
It an be expressed in terms of A(τ ) in the form A′(τ ) = f (A(τ ), g), where g is the
kinematial transformation between both observers. At instant τ + dτ , the orresponding
measured values of that observable will have hanged but A′(τ + dτ ) = f (A(τ + dτ ), g) with
the same g as before, and assuming that the evolution parameter τ is group invariant.

But if the system is elementary, we take as an assumption that the modi(cid:28)ations of the

observables produed by the dynamis an always be ompensated by a hange of inertial

referene frame. Then, given an observer O , it is always possible to (cid:28)nd at instant τ + dτ
who measures the value of an essential observable A′(τ + dτ ) with
another inertial observer O′
the same value as O does at instant τ , i.e., A′(τ + dτ )
A(τ ). If the system is not elementary,

≡

this will not be possible in general beause the external interation might hange its internal

struture, and thus it will not be possible to ompensate the modi(cid:28)ation of the observable

by a simple hange of inertial observer. Think about a non-relativisti desription of an atom

that goes into some exited state. The new internal energy, whih is Galilei invariant, annot

be transformed into the old one by a simple hange of referene frame.

But the essential observables are the kinematial variables. From the dynamial point of

X , ompatible with the ausality
view we an take as initial and (cid:28)nal points any x1 and x2 ∈
requirements. This means that any x an be onsidered as the initial point of the variational
formalism. In this way, at any instant τ if the system is elementary, we an (cid:28)nd an in(cid:28)nitesimal
kinematial transformation δg(τ ) suh that

x′(τ + dτ ) = f (x(τ + dτ ), δg(τ ))

x(τ ),

or by taking the inverse of this transformation,

x(τ + dτ ) = f −1(x(τ ), δg(τ )).

This equation represents the dynamial evolution equation in X spae. Knowledge of the
initial state x1 and the funtion δg(τ ) ompletely determines the evolution of the system. In
general, δg(τ ) will depend on the instant τ , beause the hange of the observables depends on
the external interation. But if the system is elementary and the motion is free, all δg(τ ) have
neessarily to be the same, and thus τ independent. We annot distinguish in a free motion
one instant from any other. Then, starting from x1 we shall arrive at x2 by the ontinuous
ation of the same in(cid:28)nitesimal group element δg , and the free partile motion is the ation
of the one-parameter group generated by δg on the initial state. Therefore, there should exist
G suh that x2 = gx1 . If the evolution is not free, the omposition
a (cid:28)nite group element g
[τ1, τ2], will also
of all in(cid:28)nitesimal group elements δg(τ ) for all intermediate values of τ
∈
produe a (cid:28)nite group element g , and thus, x2 = gx1 . We thus arrive at the:

∈

De(cid:28)nition: A lassial elementary partile is a Lagrangian system whose

kinematial spae X is a homogeneous spae of the kinematial group G.

Usually the Lagrangian of any lassial Newtonian system is restrited to depend only on

the (cid:28)rst order derivative of eah of the oordinates qi that represent the independent degrees
of freedom, or equivalently, that the qi satisfy seond order di(cid:27)erential equations. But at this

stage, if we do not know what are the basi variables we need to desribe our elementary

system, how an we state that they neessarily satisfy seond order di(cid:27)erential equations? If

some of the degrees of freedom, say q1 , q2 and q3 , represent the enter of mass position of the
system, Newtonian mehanis implies that in this partiular ase L will depend on the (cid:28)rst

order derivatives of these three variables. But what about other degrees of freedom? It is

this ondition on the kinematial spae to be onsidered as a homogeneous spae of G, as the

mathematial statement of elementarity, that will restrit the dependene of the Lagrangian

on these higher order derivatives. It is this de(cid:28)nition of elementary partile with the proper

eletion of the kinematial group, whih will supply information about the struture of the

Lagrangian.

The Galilei and Poinaré groups are ten-parameter Lie groups and therefore the largest

homogeneous spae we an (cid:28)nd for these groups is a ten-dimensional manifold. The variables

that de(cid:28)ne the di(cid:27)erent homogeneous spaes will share the same domains and dimensions

as the orresponding variables we use to parameterize the group. Both groups, as we shall

see later, are parameterized in terms of the following variables (b, a, v, α) with domains and
R that represents the time parameter of the time translation
dimensions respetively like b
and a
, the three spatial oordinates for the spae translation. Parameter v
three omponents of the relative veloity between the inertial observers, restrited to v < c
in the Poinaré ase. Finally α
SO(3) are three dimensionless variables whih haraterize

∈

∈

are the

the relative orientation of the orresponding Cartesian frames and whose ompat domain is

expressed in terms of a suitable parametrization of the rotation group.

In this way the maximum number of kinematial variables, for a lassial elementary parti-

le, is also ten. We represent them by x

(t, r, u, α) with the same domains and dimensions

as above and interpret them respetively as the time, position, veloity and orientation

∈

≡

of the partile.

1.5. ELEMENTARY SYSTEMS

23

Beause the Lagrangian must also depend on the next order derivatives of the kinematial

variables, we arrive at the onlusion that L must also depend on the aeleration and angular
veloity of the partile. The partile is a system of six degrees of freedom, three r , represent
the position of a point and other three α, its orientation in spae. We an visualize this by
assuming a system of three orthogonal unit vetors linked to point r as a body frame. But the
Lagrangian will depend up to the seond time derivative of r , or aeleration of that point,
and on the (cid:28)rst derivative of α, i.e., on the angular veloity. The Galilei and Poinaré groups

lead to generalized Lagrangians depending up to seond order derivatives of the position.

By this de(cid:28)nition it is the kinematial group G that implements the speial Relativity Prin-

iple that ompletely determines the struture of the kinematial spae where the Lagrangians

that represent lassial elementary partiles have to be de(cid:28)ned.

Point partiles are partiu-

11

lar ases of the above de(cid:28)nition and their kinematial spaes are just the quotient strutures

between the group G and subgroup of rotations and boosts, and thus their kinematial vari-
ables redue only to time and position (t, r). Therefore, the larger the kinematial group of

spae-time transformations, the greater the number of allowed lassial variables to desribe

elementary ob jets with a more detailed and omplex struture. In this way, the proposed

formalism an be aommodated to any symmetry group. It is the proper de(cid:28)nition of this

group whih ontains the physial information of the elementary partiles.

L(x, ˙x) = Fi(x, ˙x) ˙xi.

Funtions Fi(x, ˙x) are therefore homogeneous funtions of zero degree in the variables ˙xi

summation onvention on repeated indexes as usual is assumed.

CHAPTER 1. LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM

In the ase when α(g; x) = 0, they transform like the omponents of a ovariant vetor over
the kinematial spae X . But in general this will not be the ase and α(g; x) ontains basi

physial information about the system.

We thus (cid:28)nd that for a (cid:28)xed kinematial spae X , the knowledge of the group ation of G
on X , and the gauge funtion α(g; x), will give us information about the possible struture of
the funtions Fi(x, ˙x), and therefore about the struture of the Lagrangian.

In pratie, if we restrit ourselves to the Galilei G and Poinaré P groups, we see that P

has gauge funtions equivalent to zero and thus Poinaré Lagrangians that desribe elementary

partiles an be taken stritly invariant. In the ase of the Galilei group, it has only one lass

of gauge funtions that de(cid:28)ne the mass of the system, and thus nonrelativisti Lagrangians

will be in general not invariant. In the partiular ase of Galilei invariant Lagrangians, they

will desribe massless systems.

1.6 Appendix: Lie groups of transformations

Let us introdue the notation and general features of the ation of Lie groups on ontinuous

manifolds to analyze the transformation properties of the di(cid:27)erent magnitudes we an work

with in either lassial or quantum mehanis. We shall use these features all throughout this

book.

Let us onsider the transformation of an n-dimensional manifold X , x′ = gx given by n
G of r ontinuous parameters

This transformation is said to be the ation of a Lie group of transformations if it ful(cid:28)ls the

two onditions:

(i) G is a Lie group, i.e., there exists a group omposition law c = φ(a, b)

Equations (1.41) are the ommutation relations that haraterize the struture of the Lie

If a (cid:28)nite group transformation of parameters gσ

an be done in n smaller steps of param-
eters gσ/n, with n su(cid:30)iently large, then a (cid:28)nite transformation U(g)h(x) an be obtained

However, (1.39) is not the most general form of transformation of the wave funtion of a

quantum system, as we shall see in Chapter 3, but one we know the way it transforms we

shall be able to obtain the expliit expression of the group generators by a similar proedure

as the one developed so far. In general the wave funtion transforms under ontinuous groups

with what is alled a pro jetive unitary representation of the group, whih involves in general

some additional phase fators.

1.6.1 Casimir operators

When we have a representation of a Lie group either by linear operators or by matries

ating on a linear spae, we an de(cid:28)ne there what are alled the Casimir operators. They are

operators C that an be expressed as funtions of the generators Xσ of the Lie algebra with the
property that they ommute with all of them, i.e., they satisfy [C, Xσ] = 0,
σ = 1, . . . , r .
In general they are not expressed as real linear ombinations of the Xσ and therefore they do

∀

not belong to the Lie algebra of the group. They belong to what is alled the group algebra,

i.e., the assoiative, but in general non-ommutative algebra, spanned by the real or omplex

linear ombinations of produts of the Xσ , in the orresponding group representation.

In those representations where the Xσ are represented by self-adjoint operators as in a

quantum formalism, the Casimir operators may be also self-adjoint and will represent those

observables that remain invariant under the group transformations. In partiular, when we

onsider later the kinematial groups that relate the spae-time measurements between in-

ertial observers, the Casimir operators of these groups will represent the intrinsi properties

of the system. They are those properties of the physial system whose measured values are

independent of the inertial observers.

For semisimple groups, i.e., for groups that do not have Abelian invariant subgroups like the

rotation group SO(3), the unitary groups SU(n) and many others, it is shown that the Casimir
operators are real homogeneous polynomials of the generators Xσ , but this is no longer the

ase for general Lie groups. Nevertheless, for most of the interesting Lie groups in physis, like

Galilei, Poinaré, De Sitter, SL(4, R), the inhomogeneous ISL(4, R) and Conformal SU(2, 2)

groups, the Casimir operators an be taken as real polynomial funtions of the generators.

1.6.2 Exponents of a group

The onept of exponent of a ontinuous group G was developed by Bargmann in his work

on the pro jetive unitary representations of ontinuous groups.

Wigner's theorem about the symmetries of a physial system is well known in Quantum

Mehanis.

13

It states that if H is a Hilbert spae that haraterizes the pure quantum states of a system,
and the system has a symmetry S , then there exists a unitary or antiunitary operator U(S),
de(cid:28)ned up to a phase, that implements that symmetry on H, i.e., if φ and ψ
< φ
possible vetor states of the system and |
them and U(S)φ and U(S)ψ represent the transformed states under the operation S , then

∈ H are two

If the system has a whole group of symmetry operations G, then to eah element g
G
there is assoiated an operator U(g) unitary or antiunitary, but if G is a ontinuous group, in
that ase U(g) is neessarily unitary. This an be seen by the fat that the produt of two

∈

antiunitary operators is a unitary one.

Beause there is an ambiguity in the eletion of the phase of the unitary operator U(g),
= U(g1g2) and therefore the transformation of the wave

it implies that in general U(g1)U(g2)

funtion is not given by an expression of the form (1.39), but it also involves in general a phase

fator. However in the ase of ontinuous groups we an properly hoose the orresponding

phases of all elements in suh a way that

U(g1)U(g2) = ω(g1, g2)U(g1g2),

(1.43)

where ω(g1, g2) = exp
} is a phase that is a ontinuous funtion of its arguments. The
real ontinuous funtion on G
G, ξ(g1, g2) is alled an exponent of G. The operators U(g)
×
do not reprodue the omposition law of the group G and (1.43) represents what Bargmann

iξ(g1, g2)

{

alls a pro jetive representation of the group.

If we use the assoiative property of the group law, we get

(U(g1)U(g2)) U(g3) = ω(g1, g2)U(g1g2)U(g3)

= ω(g1, g2)ω(g1g2, g3)U(g1g2g3),

U(g1) (U(g2)U(g3)) = U(g1)ω(g2, g3)U(g2g3)

= ω(g1, g2g3)ω(g2, g3)U(g1g2g3).

and also

Therefore

ω(g1, g2)ω(g1g2, g3) = ω(g1, g2g3)ω(g2, g3),

whih in terms of the exponents beomes:

ξ(g1, g2) + ξ(g1g2, g3) = ξ(g1, g2g3) + ξ(g2, g3).

Beause of the ontinuity of the exponents,

transitive way. The term homogeneous reminds us that the loal properties of the manifold at

a point x are translated to any other point of the manifold by means of the group ation, and
therefore all points of X share the same loal properties.

X , the stabilizer group (little group) of x0 is the subgroup Hx0 of G,

homogeneous spae of G, then the whole X is the orbit of any of its points.

The orbit of a point x is the set of points of the form gx, ∀
g
Given a point x0 ∈
If H is a subgroup of G, then every element g

that leaves invariant the point x0 , i.e., ∀

the manifold G/Hx0 .

G an be written as g = g′h, where h

The homogeneous spaes of a group an be onstruted as quotient manifolds of the group

by all its possible ontinuous subgroups. Conversely, it an also be shown that if X a homo-
geneous spae of a group G, then there exists a subgroup H of G suh that X is isomorphi
to G/H . Therefore, the largest homogeneous spae of a group is the group itself.

where H is the six-dimensional subgroup of the homogeneous Galilei transformations of ele-
ments of the form (0, 0, v, µ). See the Appendix at the end of this hapter for the notation
related to the Galilei group. Then X is a four-dimensional manifold spanned by the variables

evolution two di(cid:27)erent inertial observers relate their measurements by:

Beause of the way they transform, we an interpret them respetively as the time and position

of the system. If we assume that the evolution parameter τ is group invariant, by taking the
τ
kinematial variables at any instant τ transform as:

−derivative of both sides of the above expressions, it turns out that the derivatives of the

t′(τ ) = t(τ ) + b,
r′(τ ) = R(µ)r(τ ) + vt(τ ) + a.

˙t′(τ ) = ˙t(τ ),
˙r′(τ ) = R(µ) ˙r(τ ) + v ˙t(τ ).

There are no onstraints among these variables. It is only the homogeneity of the Lagrangian

in terms of their derivatives (1.9) whih redues to three the number of independent degrees

of freedom. This homogeneity leads to the general form:

We reserve for these observables the same symbols as the orresponding group generators

whih produe the spae-time transformations that leave dynamial equations invariant. Even

their names make referene to the orresponding group transformation parameter, exept the

energy whih in this ontext should be alled the `temporal momentum'. For the kinemat-

ial momentum we an (cid:28)nd in the literature alternative names like `Galilei momentum' or

`stati momentum'. Being onsistent with this notation, we should all it `Poinaré or Lorentz

momentum' in a relativisti approah. Nevertheless we shall use the name of kinematial mo-

mentum for this observable K in either relativisti or non-relativisti formalism. None of these

onserved quantities assoiated to the symmetry under one-parameter subgroups are de(cid:28)nite

positive so that the observable H an take any sign.

The linear momentum takes the general expression P = m ˙r/ ˙t = mu beause taking the
˙K = 0, implies P = mu, where u is the

τ -derivative in (2.13) of the kinematial momentum,

time derivative of the position of the system, i.e., the veloity of the partile.

2.2. GALILEI FREE SPINNING PARTICLE

The six onditions P = 0 and K = 0, imply u = 0 and r = 0, so that the system is

at rest and plaed at the origin of the observer's referene frame. There is still an arbitrary

rotation and a time translation to (cid:28)x a unique inertial observer. Nevertheless we all this lass

of observers, for whih P = 0 and K = 0, the enter of mass observer. These six onditions

will be also used as the de(cid:28)nition of the enter of mass observer for any other system even in

a relativisti approah.

From (2.9) and (2.10) we see that the energy and linear momentum transform as:

H ′ = H + v

R(µ)P +

mv2,

P ′ = R(µ)P + mv.

Then, if H0 and P = 0 are the energy and linear momentum measured by the enter of mass
observer, for any arbitrary observer who sees the partile moving with veloity u, it follows

from (2.15) and (2.16) that

The Lagrangian for the point partile is thus

CHAPTER 2. SOLUBLE EXAMPLES OF SPINNING PARTICLES

Among these kinematial variables there exist the di(cid:27)erential onstraints u(τ ) = ˙r(τ )/ ˙t(τ ),
that together with the homogeneity ondition of the Lagrangian L in terms of the derivatives

of the kinematial variables:

L(x, ˙x) = (∂L/∂ ˙xi) ˙xi,

(2.23)

redue from ten to six the essential degrees of freedom of the system.

These degrees of freedom are the position r(t) and the orientation ρ(t). The Lagrangian
depends on the seond derivative of r(t) and the (cid:28)rst derivative of ρ(t). Expression (2.23) is

expliitly given by:

where the funtions T = ∂L/∂ ˙t, Ri = ∂L/∂ ˙ri
funtions of the ten kinematial variables (t, r, u, ρ) and homogeneous funtions of zero degree
in terms of the derivatives ( ˙t, ˙r, ˙u, ˙ρ). By assuming that the evolution parameter τ is group

Instead of the derivative ˙ρ(τ ) that transforms in a ompliated way, we an de(cid:28)ne the

angular veloity of the partile ω as a funtion of it in the form

It is a linear funtion of ˙ρ, and transforms as:

2

ω =

1 + ρ2 ( ˙ρ + ρ

×

˙ρ).

ω′(τ ) = R(µ)ω(τ ).

We interpret the rotation matrix R(ρ) as the rotation that arries the initial frame linked to
the body at instant τ = 0 to the frame at instant τ , as in a rigid body. Then, the three
olumns of matrix R(ρ) represent the Cartesian omponents of the three unit vetors linked
to the body when hosen parallel to the laboratory frame at instant τ = 0.

If k(τ ) is any internal vetor of a rigid body with origin at point r , then its dynamis is ontained
in the expression k(τ ) = R(ρ(τ ))k(0). The veloity of point k is

˙k(τ ) = ˙R(ρ(τ ))k(0) = ˙R(ρ(τ ))R

−1(ρ(τ ))k(τ ) = Ω(τ )k(τ )

where matrix Ω = ˙RR−1 = ˙RRT
I, where supersript T means the transposed matrix and I is the 3

is an antisymmetri matrix. At any instant τ , R(ρ(τ ))RT (ρ(τ )) =
3 unit matrix. Taking the τ -
˙RRT + R ˙RT = Ω + ΩT = 0, and thus the three essential omponents

Expression (2.22) orresponds to R(ρ′(τ )) = R(µ)R(ρ(τ )). Therefore

Ω′ = ˙R(ρ′(τ ))RT (ρ′(τ )) = R(µ) ˙R(ρ(τ ))RT (ρ(τ ))RT (µ)

= R(µ)ΩR−1(µ),

and this leads to the equation (2.30) in terms of the essential omponents ω of the antisym-
metri matrix Ω.

due to the linearity of ω in terms of ˙ρ and where Wi = ∂L/∂ωi

L = T ˙t + R

˙r + U

Sine X is the whole Galilei group G the most general gauge funtion is just the group

exponent:

α(g; x) = ξ(g, hx) = m(v2t(τ )/2 + v

R(µ)r(τ )),

similar to (2.6), and this allows us to interpret the parameter m as the mass of the system.
Under the ation of an arbitrary element of the Galilei group, the Lagrangian L transforms

aording to:

L(gx(τ ), d(gx(τ ))/dτ ) = L(x(τ ), ˙x(τ )) + dα(g; x(τ ))/dτ.

(2.34)

·

This leads through some straightforward alulations, similar to the ones performed in (2.8)-

b) Under spatial translation, A(x1, x2) is invariant and this de(cid:28)nes the total linear momen-

δt = 0, M = 0, δri = δai, M (0)

ij = δij, δui = 0, M (1)

ij = 0,

) Under a pure Galilei transformation of veloity δv , A(x1, x2) is no longer invariant but taking
δv
into aount (1.28) and the gauge funtion (2.33), it transforms as δA = mr2 ·

momentum equivalent to Dira's spin operator in the quantum ase. Beause J is the angular
momentum of the partile with respet to the origin of the observer frame, Z represents the
angular momentum of the partile with respet to the point r. We shall de(cid:28)ne the spin for a

free partile as the angular momentum with respet to its enter of mass, one we aurately

identify the enter of mass of the partile.

The enter of mass observer is de(cid:28)ned as that inertial observer for whom P = 0 and K = 0.

These six onditions do not de(cid:28)ne uniquely an inertial observer but rather a lass of them up to

a rotation and an arbitrary time translation. In fat, the ondition P = 0 establishes the lass
of observers for whih the enter of mass is at rest, and K = 0 is the additional ondition to

q is just the relative
position of point r with respet to the enter of mass. Therefore P = 0 and K = 0 give rise
to dq/dt = 0, and r = k, i.e., q = 0, as we pointed out. With this de(cid:28)nition, the kinematial

of harge around the enter of mass. Point r , as representing the position of the enter of

To analyze the spin struture of the partile, and therefore the di(cid:27)erent ontributions to

spin oming from these funtions U and W , let us onsider the following simpler example.

no orientation variables. The Lagrangian will also depend on the next order derivatives, i.e.,

on the veloity whih is already onsidered as a kinematial variable and on the aeleration

of the partile. Rotation and translation invariane implies that L will be a funtion of only
du/dt = d(u2/2)/dt, but this last term is a total time derivative and it
u2

, (du/dt)2

Parameter m is the mass of the partile beause the (cid:28)rst term is gauge variant in terms of the
−1
gauge funtion (2.33) de(cid:28)ned by this onstant m, while parameter ω of dimensions of time

represents an internal frequeny. It is the frequeny of the internal zitterbewegung.

In terms of the kinematial variables and their derivatives, and in terms of some group

invariant evolution parameter τ , the Lagrangian an also be written as

all terms in the Lagrangian have dimensions of ation. Beause the Lagrangian is a homoge-

It is the sum of the orbital angular momentum L assoiated to the motion of the enter of
mass and the spin part S . For a free partile both L and S are separately onstants of the
motion. We use the term (anti)orbital to suggest that if vetor k represents the position of
a point mass m, the angular momentum of this motion is in the opposite diretion as the
obtained spin observable. But as we shall see in a moment, vetor k does not represent the
position of the mass m but rather the position of the harge e of the partile.

2.2.3 Interating with an external eletromagneti (cid:28)eld

But if q represents the enter of mass position, then what position does point r represent?
Point r represents the position of the harge of the partile. This an be seen by onsidering

some interation with an external (cid:28)eld. The homogeneity ondition of the Lagrangian in terms

of the derivatives of the kinematial variables leads us to onsider an interation term of the

form

whih is linear in the derivatives of the kinematial variables t and r and where the external
potentials are only funtions of t and r . We an also onsider more general interation terms of
the form N (t, r, u)
˙u, and also more general terms in whih funtions φ and A also depend on
u and ˙u. If the interation Lagrangian depends on ˙u this implies that the interation modi(cid:28)es
the de(cid:28)nition of the observable U = mk whih de(cid:28)nes the spin of the free system. But if the

system is elementary the spin de(cid:28)nition annot be hanged, so that (2.69) is the most general

interation term.

The enter of mass q satis(cid:28)es Newton's equations under the ation of the total external Lorentz
fore, while point r still satis(cid:28)es the isotropi harmoni motion of angular frequeny ω around
point q . But the external fore and the (cid:28)elds are de(cid:28)ned at point r and not at point q . It is the
veloity u of point r that appears in the magneti term of the Lorentz fore. Point r learly

represents the position of the harge. In fat, this minimal oupling we have onsidered is the

oupling of the eletromagneti potentials with the partile urrent, that in the relativisti ase

an be written as jµAµ

, but the urrent jµ is assoiated to the motion of a harge e at point r .

the enter of mass, but it is this internal orbital motion, usually known as the zitterbewegung,

that gives rise to the spin struture for this model and also to the magneti properties of the

partile, as we shall see later.

When analyzed in the enter of mass frame (see Fig. 2.1), q = 0, r = k, the system redues
D = 0,
to a point harge whose motion is in general an ellipse, but if we hoose C = D , and C
it redues to a irle of radius a = C = D , orthogonal to the spin. Then if the partile has
harge e, it has a magneti moment that aording to the usual lassial de(cid:28)nition is:

(2.73)

where j = eδ3(r
k)dk/dt is the urrent assoiated to the motion of a harge e loated at
point k. The magneti moment is orthogonal to the zitterbewegung plane and opposite to the
spin if e > 0. It also has a non-vanishing osillating eletri dipole d = ek, orthogonal to µ
and therefore to S in the enter of mass frame, suh that its time average value vanishes for

−

times larger than the natural period of this internal motion. Although this is a nonrelativisti

example it is interesting to point out and ompare with Dira's relativisti analysis of the

2.2.4 Spinning Galilei partile with orientation

Another simple example of spinning partiles is the one in whih the spin is related only

to the angular variables that desribe orientation.

Let us assume now a dynamial system whose kinematial spae is X =

/R3

G

} is the 3-parameter Abelian subgroup of pure Galilei transformations. Then,

The Lagrangian for this model takes the general form

L = T ˙t + R

˙r + W

·

·

Beause of the struture of the exponent (2.167), the gauge funtion for this system an be

taken the same as before. The general relationship (2.46) leads to W
ω = 0, beause the
Lagrangian is independent of ˙u, and therefore W and ω must be ollinear. Aording to the
transformation properties of the Lagrangian, the third term W
ω is Galilei invariant and
ω and one possible Lagrangian that desribes
sine W and ω are ollinear, we an take W

where u = dr/dt is the veloity of point r , and Ω = ω/ ˙t is the time evolution angular
veloity. Point r is moving at a onstant speed and it also represents the position of the
enter of mass. The spin is just the observable S
W that satis(cid:28)es the dynamial equation
dS/dt = ω
S = 0, and thus the frame linked to the body rotates with a onstant angular
veloity Ω.

The spin takes the onstant value S = IΩ, whose absolute value is independent of the
inertial observer and also the angular veloity Ω = ω/ ˙t is onstant. The parameter I plays the

role of a prinipal moment of inertia, suggesting a linear relationship between the spin and the

angular veloity, whih orresponds to a partile with spherial symmetry. The partile an

also be onsidered as an extended ob jet of gyration radius R0 , related to the other partile
parameters by I = mR2
0 .

This system orresponds lassially to a rigid body with spherial symmetry where the

orientation variables ρ an desribe for instane, the orientation of its prinipal axes of inertia

in a suitable parametrization of the rotation group. This is a system of six degrees of freedom.

Three represent the position of the enter of harge r and the other three ρ, represent the
orientation of a Cartesian frame linked to that point r . Sine for this system there is no

same point.

In the enter of mass frame there is no urrent assoiated to this partile and therefore it

has neither magneti nor eletri dipole struture. As seen in previous examples, all magneti

properties seem therefore to be related to the zitterbewegung part of spin and are absent in

this rigid body-like model.

≡

t′(τ ) = γt(τ ) + γ(v

R(µ)r(τ ))/c2 + b,

·

r′(τ ) = R(µ)r(τ ) + γvt(τ ) +

R(µ)r(τ ))v + a,

γ2
(1 + γ)c2 (v

·

and are interpreted as the time and position of the system. If, as usual, we assume that the

evolution parameter τ is invariant under the group, taking the τ -derivatives of (2.75) and (2.76)

we get

˙t′(τ ) = γ ˙t(τ ) + γ(v

R(µ) ˙r(τ ))/c2,
γ2
(1 + γ)c2 (v

·

˙r′(τ ) = R(µ) ˙r(τ ) + γv ˙t(τ ) +

R(µ) ˙r(τ ))v.

The homogeneity ondition of the Lagrangian, in terms of the derivatives of the kinematial

variables, redues to three the number of degrees of freedom of the system. This leads to the

general expression

L = T ˙t + R

˙r,

·

where T = ∂L/∂ ˙t and Ri = ∂L/∂ ˙ri , will be funtions of t and r and homogeneous funtions
of zero degree of ˙t(τ ) and ˙r(τ ). Beause the Lagrangian is invariant under P , the funtions T
and R transform under the group P in the form:
R(µ)R),

T ′ = γT

γ(v

γvT /c2 +

We thus see that T and R are invariant under translations and therefore they must be funtions
independent of t and r .

The onjugate momenta of the independent degrees of freedom qi = ri are pi = ∂L/∂ ˙ri ,

and onsequently Noether's theorem (1.25) leads to the following onstants of the motion,

that are alulated similarly as in the Galilei ase exept for the invariane under pure Lorentz

Taking the τ derivative of the kinematial momentum,

P 2 = m2c2

is a Poinaré

invariant and a onstant of the motion. This de(cid:28)nes the mass of the partile whih we take as

There are three maximal homogeneous spaes of P , all of them at (cid:28)rst parameterized by
the variables (t, r, u, ρ), where the veloity variable u an be either u < c, u = c or u > c. We

position of the harge r satis(cid:28)es u < c, we all a Bradyon, from the Greek term βραδυς

seond lass of partiles (u = c) will be alled Luxons beause point r is always moving at
the speed of light for every observer, and (cid:28)nally those of the third group, beause u > c, are
alled Tahyons, from the Greek τ αχυς

≡ fast.

For the seond lass we use the Latin denomination Luxons in spite of the Greek one of

photons, beause this lass of partiles will supply the desription not only of lassial photons

but also a lassial model of the eletron. This lass of models is very important and it has

no nonrelativisti limit. Therefore the models this manifold produe have no nonrelativisti

equivalent.

The (cid:28)rst lass orresponds to a kinematial spae that is the Poinaré group itself and

produes models equivalent to the ones analyzed in the non-relativisti ase. To desribe the

lassial eletron and the photon we shall onsider next the ase of luxons.

our de(cid:28)nition of elementary partile has to be onsidered as a possible andidate for desrib-

ing the kinematial spae of an elementary system. In fat, if we onsider the point in this

manifold x
Vu of pure Lorentz transformations in the diretion of the vetor u. Then X

(0, 0, u, 0), the little group that leaves x invariant is the one-parameter subgroup
Vu , is a

nine-dimensional homogeneous spae.

For this kind of systems the variables t, r transform aording to (2.75) and (2.76), re-
spetively and the derivatives as in (2.77) and (2.78). For the veloity u the transformation is

Sine u′ = u = c, the absolute value of the veloity vetor is onserved and it means that u′
an be obtained from u by an orthogonal transformation, so that the transformation equations

of the veloity under P an be expressed as:

u′ = R(φ)u,

where the kinematial rotation of parameter φ is

In this ase there also exist among the kinematial variables the onstraints u = ˙r/ ˙t.

Equation (2.91) also orresponds to

φ =

µ + F c(v, µ; u(τ ), 0)
1 + Gc(v, µ; u(τ ), 0)

.

R(ρ′) = R(φ)R(ρ),

with the same φ in both ases, as in (2.95).

Sine the variable u(τ ) = c, during the whole evolution, we an distinguish two di(cid:27)erent
kinds of systems, beause, by taking the derivative with respet to τ of this expression we get
u(τ ) = 0, i.e., systems for whih ˙u = 0 or massless systems as we shall see, and systems
˙u(τ )
where ˙u
= 0 but always orthogonal to u. These systems will orrespond to massive partiles
whose harge internal motion ours at the onstant veloity c, although their enter of mass
moves with veloity below c.

·

2.5.1 Massless partiles. (The photon)

If ˙u = 0, u is onstant and the system follows a straight tra jetory with onstant veloity,
and therefore the kinematial variables redue simply to (t, r, ρ) with domains and physial
meaning as usual as, time, position and orientation, respetively. The derivatives ˙t and ˙r
transform like (2.77) and (2.78) and instead of the variable ˙ρ we shall onsider the linear
funtion ω de(cid:28)ned in (2.29) that transforms under P :

ω′(τ ) = R(φ)ω(τ ),

(2.97)

where, again, φ is given by (2.95).

In fat, from (2.96), sine ˙u = 0, taking the τ -derivative,

˙R(ρ′

) = R(φ) ˙R(ρ),

the antisymmetri matrix Ω = ˙R(ρ)RT (ρ) has as essential omponents the angular veloity ω ,

) = R(φ) ˙R(ρ)RT (ρ)RT (φ) = R(φ)ΩRT (φ),

and this matrix transformation leads for its essential omponents to (2.97).

For this system there are no onstraints among the kinematial variables, and, sine ˙u = 0,

the general form of its Lagrangian is

Funtions T = ∂L/∂ ˙t, Ri = ∂L/∂ ˙ri, Wi = ∂L/∂ωi

and are homogeneous funtions of zero degree in terms of the derivatives of the kinematial

= 0 they will be expressed in terms of u = ˙r/ ˙t and Ω = ω/ ˙t, whih

are the true veloity and angular veloity of the partile respetively.

Invariane of the Lagrangian under P leads to the following transformation form of these

funtions under the group P :

They are translation invariant and therefore independent of t and r . They will be funtions
of only (ρ, u, Ω), with the onstraint u = c. Invariane under rotations forbids the expliit
dependene on ρ, so that the dependene of these funtions on ρ and ˙ρ variables is only
through the angular veloity ω .

Noether's theorem gives rise, as before, to the following onstants of the motion:

In this ase the system has no zitterbewegung beause the Lagrangian does not depend on

speed of light and therefore it is not possible to (cid:28)nd an inertial rest frame observer. Although

we have no enter of mass observer, we de(cid:28)ne the spin by S = J

an elementary partile exept if this onstant dS/dt = 0. Therefore for this system the spin is
a onstant of the motion and P and u are ollinear vetors.

CHAPTER 2. SOLUBLE EXAMPLES OF SPINNING PARTICLES

The relation between P and u an be obtained from (2.105), taking the τ -derivative and the
ondition that the spin W is onstant,
the salar produt of this expression with u we also get H = P

H ˙r/c2 + P ˙t, i.e., P = Hu/c2
u.

˙K = 0 =

−

. If we take

·

Then, from (2.107) and (2.108), an invariant and onstant of the motion, whih vanishes,

P 2

is (H/c)2
. The mass of this system is zero. It turns out that for this partile both H and
P are non-vanishing for every inertial observer. Otherwise, if one of them vanishes for a single
observer they vanish for all of them. By (2.109), S2

−

is another Poinaré invariant property of

the system that is also a onstant of the motion.

The (cid:28)rst part of the Lagrangian T ˙t + R

˙r =
u) ˙t = 0, also vanishes. Then the Lagrangian is redued to the third term S

˙r , whih an be written as

H ˙t + P

ω .

We see from (2.94) and (2.109) that the dimensionless magnitude ǫ = S

u/Sc is another

−

−

·

·

·

invariant and onstant of the motion, and we thus expet that the Lagrangian will be expliitly

dependent on both onstant parameters S and ǫ. Taking into aount the transformation
properties under P of u, ω and S , given in (2.94), (2.97) and (2.109) respetively, it turns out
that the spin must neessarily be a vetor funtion of u and ω .
If the spin is not transversal, as it happens for real photons, then S = ǫ Su/c where ǫ =
1,

and thus the Lagrangian (cid:28)nally beomes:

L =

ǫ S

(2.110)

From this Lagrangian we get that the energy is H =

Ω, where Ω = ω/ ˙t
is the angular veloity of the partile. The linear momentum is P = ∂L/∂ ˙r = ǫ S Ω/c, and,
sine P and u are parallel vetors, Ω and u must also be parallel, and if the energy is de(cid:28)nite
positive, then Ω = ǫΩu/c.

∂L/∂ ˙t = S

−

·

This means that the energy H = SΩ. For photons we know that S = ~, and thus H =

In this way the frequeny of a photon is the frequeny of its rotational motion

~Ω = hν .

around the diretion of its tra jetory. We thus see that the spin and angular veloity for

H > 0 partiles have the same diretion, although they are not analytially related, beause
S is invariant under P while Ω is not.

We say that the Lagrangian (2.110) represents a photon of spin S and polarization ǫ. A

set of photons of this kind, all with the same polarization, orresponds to irularly polarized

light, as has been shown by diret measurement of the angular momentum arried by these

5

photons.

Left and right polarized photons orrespond to ǫ = 1 and ǫ =

1, respetively.
Energy is related to the angular frequeny H = ~Ω, and linear momentum to the wave number
P = ~k, that therefore is related to the angular veloity vetor by k = ǫΩ/c. If it is possible

−

to talk about the `wave-length' of a single photon this will be the distane run by the partile

during a omplete turn.

2.5.2 Massive partiles. (The eletron)

If we onsider now the other possibility, ˙u

= 0 but orthogonal to u, then variables ˙t and ˙r

transform as in the previous ase (2.77) and (2.78), but for ˙u and ω we have:

(2.114)

and therefore

Ω′ = ˙R(ρ′)RT (ρ′) = R(φ)ΩRT (φ) + ˙R(φ)RT (φ).
R(φ)ΩRT (φ) orresponds to R(φ)ω and the antisymmetri matrix Ωφ = ˙R(φ)RT (φ) has as
essential omponents the ωφ vetor, i.e., equation (2.113).

order of the zitterbewegung radius is a plausible marosopi vision but is not neessary to

maintain any longer, beause the only important point from the dynamial point of view is the

enter of harge position, whose motion ompletely determines the dynamis of the system.

In this form, elementary partiles, the kind of ob jets we are desribing, look like extended

ob jets. Nevertheless, although some kind of related length an be de(cid:28)ned, they are dealt

with as point partiles with orientation beause the physial attributes are all loated at the

single point r . The dynamis of equation (2.126) an be represented in (cid:28)gure2.2 where we
S = Su + Sω , related respetively
have separated the two ontributions to the total spin Z

≡

to the orbital and rotational motion.

We see that the partile has mass and spin, and the enter of harge moves in irles at

the speed of light in a plane orthogonal to the spin, for the enter of mass observer. All these

features are independent of the partiular Lagrangian of the type (2.115) we an onsider. All

that remains is to desribe the evolution of the orientation and therefore its angular veloity.

The analysis developed until now is ompatible with many di(cid:27)erent possibilities for the angular

veloity. The behaviour of the angular veloity depends on the partiular model we work with.

To end this setion and with the above model of the eletron in mind, it is onvenient to

remember some of the features that Dira

obtained for the motion of a free eletron. Let

9

point r be the position vetor on whih Dira's spinor ψ(t, r) is de(cid:28)ned. When omputing the
veloity of point r , Dira arrives at:

a) The veloity u = i/~[H, r] = cα, is expressed in terms of α matries and writes, `. . . a

measurement of a omponent of the veloity of a free eletron is ertain to lead to the result

b) The linear momentum does not have the diretion of this veloity u, but must be related
to some average value of it: . . . `the x1 omponent of the veloity, cα1 , onsists of two parts,
a onstant part c2p1H −1
and an osillatory part, whose frequeny is at least 2mc2/h, . . .'.

, onneted with the momentum by the lassial relativisti formula,

) About the position r:

`The osillatory part of x1 is small, . . . , whih is of order of

And when analyzing, in his original 1928 paper,

the interation of the eletron with an

in the spinning eletron model' (Pauli model). `The eletri moment, being a pure imaginary,

we should not expet to appear in the model.'

However, if we look at our lassial model, we see that for the enter of mass observer,

there is a non-vanishing eletri and magneti dipole moment

This lassial model gives rise to the same kinematial predition as the nonrelativisti

model desribed in Se.2.2.3. If the harge of the partile is negative, the urrent of Fig.2.2

produes a magneti moment that neessarily has the same diretion as the spin.

If the

eletron spin and magneti moments are antiparallel, then we need another ontribution to

the total spin, di(cid:27)erent from the zitterbewegung. All real experiments to determine very

aurately the gyromagneti ratio are based on the determination of preession frequenies, but

these preession frequenies are independent of the spin orientation. However, the di(cid:30)ulty

to separate eletrons in a Stern-Gerlah type experiment, suggests to perform polarization

experiments in order to determine in a diret way whether spin and magneti moment for

elementary partiles are either parallel or antiparallel. We have suggested a ouple of plausible

experiments to determine the relative orientation between the spin and magneti moment of

free eletrons and also for eletrons in the outer shell of atoms

11

Another onsequene of the lassial model is that it enhanes the role of the so-alled

minimal oupling interation jµAµ

. The magneti properties of the eletron are produed by

the urrent of its internal motion and not by some possible distribution of magneti dipoles,

so that the only possible interation of a point harge at r with the external eletromagneti
(cid:28)eld is that of the urrent jµ
, assoiated to the motion of point r, with the external potentials.

2.6 The dynamial equation of the spinning eletron

We have seen that for relativisti partiles with u = c and u and ˙u orthogonal vetors, the
position vetor r moves in irles aording to the dynamial equation (2.126) in the enter

of mass frame, as depited in (cid:28)gure 2.2. But this solution is independent of the partiular

Lagrangian we hoose as an invariant funtion of the kinematial variables and their derivatives,

whih aomplish with this orthogonality u

˙u = 0, requirement. We are going to analyze this

dynamial equation for any arbitrary inertial observer.

Let us onsider the tra jetory r(t), t

[t1, t2] followed by a point of a system for an

arbitrary inertial observer O . Any other inertial observer O′

is related to the previous one by

any spae-time event are given by

t′ = T (t, r; g1, . . . , gr),

r′ = R(t, r; g1, . . . , gr),

where the funtions T and R de(cid:28)ne the ation of the kinematial group G, of parameters
(g1, . . . , gr), on spae-time. Then the desription of the tra jetory of that point for observer

is obtained from

r′(t) = R(t, r(t); g1, . . . , gr),

of the point. This di(cid:27)erential equation is invariant by onstrution beause it is independent

of the group parameters and therefore independent of the inertial observer. If G is either the

Galilei or Poinaré group it is a ten-parameter group so that we have to work out in general up

to the fourth derivative to obtain su(cid:30)ient equations to eliminate the ten group parameters.

Therefore the order of the di(cid:27)erential equation is ditated by the number of parameters and

the struture of the kinematial group.

Let us assume the above eletron model. Sine the harge is moving at the speed of light

for the enter of mass observer O∗

it is moving at this speed for every other inertial observer

any arbitrary inertial observer is given by:

2.7 Appendix: Galilei group

The Galilei group is a group of spae-time transformations haraterized by ten parameters

(b, a, v, α). The ation of g on a spae-time point x

(t, r) is given by x′ = gx, and is

as the ation of a rotation followed by a pure Galilei transformation and (cid:28)nally a spae and

time translation.

In this way all parameters that de(cid:28)ne eah one-parameter subgroup are

normal, beause the exponential mapping works. Expliitly

and the omposition law of the group g′′ = g′g is:

t′ = t + b,
r′ = R(α)r + vt + a,

b′′ = b′ + b,
a′′ = R(α′)a + v′b + a′,
v′′ = R(α′)v + v′,
R(α′′) = R(α′)R(α).

For rotations we shall alternatively use two di(cid:27)erent parametrizations. One is the normal

or anonial parametrization in terms of a three vetor α = αn, where n is a unit vetor along
the rotation axis, and α
[0, π] is the lokwise rotation angle in radians, when looking along
n. Another, in terms of a three vetor µ = n tan(α/2), whih is more suitable to represent

∈

algebraially the omposition of rotations.

The rotation matrix R(α) = exp(α

J ) is expressed in terms of the normal parameters αi
and in terms of the antisymmetri matrix generators Ji whih have the usual matrix represen-

Relations (2.172) represent ten onditions among the 16 omponents of the matrix Λ, so

that eah matrix depends on six essential parameters, whih an be hosen in many ways.

Throughout this book we shall take three of them as the omponents of the relative veloity

v between inertial observers and the remaining three as the orientation α of their Cartesian

frames, expressed in a suitable parametrization of the rotation group.

Therefore, every element of the Poinaré group P will be represented, as in the previous
(b, a, v, α) and the group ation on a

ase of the Galilei group, by the ten parameters g

Parameter β in (2.173) is the normal parameter for the pure Lorentz transformations, that
in terms of the relative veloity among observers v is expressed as β/β tanh β = v/c as we
shall see below. The dimensions and domains of the parameters b, a and µ are the same
as those of the Galilei group, and the parameter v
, with the upper bound v < c, has

also dimensions of veloity. The physial meaning of these ten parameters, that relate any two

The Poinaré group has no non-trivial exponents, so that gauge funtions when restrited to

homogeneous spaes of P vanish.

2.8.1 Lorentz group

The Lorentz group L is the subgroup of transformations of the form (0, 0, v, µ), and every
Lorentz transformation Λ(v, µ) will be interpreted as Λ(v, µ) = L(v)R(µ), as mentioned
before where L(v) is a boost or pure Lorentz transformation and R(µ) a spatial rotation.

Quantization of the models

Quantization of generalized Lagrangian systems will suggest that wave funtions for ele-

mentary partiles must be squared integrable funtions de(cid:28)ned on the kinematial spae.

We shall use Feynman's quantization method to show the struture of the wave funtion

and the way it transforms under the kinematial or symmetry group of the theory. One the

Hilbert spae struture of the state spae is determined, this leads to a spei(cid:28) representation

of the generators of the group as self-adjoint operators and the remaining analysis is done

within the usual quantum mehanial ontext, i.e., by hoosing the omplete ommuting set of

operators to properly determine a set of orthogonal basis vetors of the Hilbert spae. Speial

emphasis is devoted to the analysis of the di(cid:27)erent angular momentum operators the formalism

supplies. They have a similar struture to the lassial ones, and this will help us to properly

obtain the identi(cid:28)ation of the spin observable.

The struture of the spin operator depends on the kind of translation invariant kinematial

variables we use to desribe the partile, and the way these variables transform under the

rotation group. Sine in the Galilei and Poinaré ase, as we have seen previously, these

variables are the veloity u and orientation α and they transform in the same way under

rotations in both approahes, then the struture of the spin operator is exatly the same in

both relativisti and nonrelativisti formalisms.

As we have seen in the lassial desription the position of the harge of the partile

and its enter of mass are di(cid:27)erent points, and spin is related to the rotation and internal

motion (zitterbewegung) of the harge around the enter of mass of the partile. The magneti

properties of the partile are onneted only with the motion of the harge and therefore to

the zitterbewegung part of spin. It is this double spin struture that gives rise to the onept

of gyromagneti ratio when expressing the magneti moment in terms of the total spin. If the

Lagrangian shows no dependene on the aeleration, the spin is only of rotational nature,

and the position and enter of mass position de(cid:28)ne the same point. Spin 1/2 partiles arise

if the orresponding lassial model rotates but no half integer spins are obtained for systems

with spin of orbital nature related only to the zitterbewegung. On the manifold spanned by

non-ompat variables u no half-integer spins an be found, beause the spin operator has the

form of an orbital angular momentum and eigenvetors are but spherial harmonis.

Dira's equation will be obtained when quantizing the lassial relativisti spinning partiles

whose enter of harge is irling around its enter of mass at the speed c. In that ase, the

internal orientation of the eletron ompletely haraterizes its Dira algebra.

CHAPTER 3. QUANTIZATION OF THE MODELS

3.1 Feynman's quantization of Lagrangian systems

Let us onsider a generalized Lagrangian system as desribed in previous hapters and

whose evolution is onsidered on the kinematial spae between points x1 and x2 .

For quantizing these generalized Lagrangian systems we shall follow Feynman's path inte-

gral method.

The Unertainty Priniple is introdued in Feynman's approah by the ondition

1

that if no measurement is performed to determine the tra jetory followed by the system from

x1 to x2 , then all paths x(τ ) are allowed with the same probability. Therefore a probability
de(cid:28)nition P [x(τ )], must be given for every path.

But instead of de(cid:28)ning the probability assoiated to eah possible path P [x(τ )], this is
alulated in terms of a probability amplitude, φ[x(τ )] for that path suh that P [x(τ )] =
1. But in general φ does not need to be a positive real number; in
φ[x(τ )]
|
|
fat it is a omplex number. Thus, to every possible tra jetory followed by the system, x(τ )
in X spae, Feynman assoiates a omplex number φ[x(τ )] alled the probability amplitude of

, where 0

φ[x(τ )] = N exp

L(x(τ ), ˙x(τ ))dτ

(cid:27)

(cid:27)

(cid:26)

where N is a path independent normalization fator, and where the phase of this omplex
number in units of ~ is the lassial ation of the system A[x](x1, x2) along the path x(τ ).

One we perform the integration along the path, this probability amplitude beomes learly a

funtion of the initial and (cid:28)nal points in X spae, x1 and x2 , respetively.

In this Feynman statistial proedure, the probability amplitude of the ourrene of any

alternative of a set of independent alternatives is the sum of the orresponding probability

amplitudes of the di(cid:27)erent independent events. The probability of the whole proess is the

square of the absolute value of the total probability amplitude. This produes the e(cid:27)et that

the probability of the whole proess an be less than the probability of any single alternative

of the set. This is what Feynman alls interfering statistis.

Then, the total probability amplitude that the system arrives at point x2 oming from x1 ,
i.e., Feynman's kernel K(x1, x2), is obtained as the sum or integration over all paths, of terms
of the form of Eq. (3.1). Feynman's kernel K(x1, x2), will be in general a funtion, or more
preisely a distribution, on the X
X manifold. If information onerning the initial point is
lost, and the (cid:28)nal point is left arbitrary, say x, the kernel redues to the probability amplitude
for (cid:28)nding the system at point x, i.e., the usual interpretation of the quantum mehanial wave
funtion Φ(x). By the above disussion we see that wave funtions must be omplex funtions

×

of the kinematial variables.

We thus see that Feynman's quantization method enhanes the role of the kinematial

variables to desribe the quantum state of an arbitrary system, in spite of the independent

degrees of freedom. We onsider that this is one of the reasons why the kinematial variables

have to play a leading role also in the lassial approah.

We are used to onsider in quantum mehanis, instead of a single funtion Φ(x), mul-
tiomponent wave funtions, i.e, a set of linearly independent funtions ψi(t, r) de(cid:28)ned on

spae-time and labeled with a disrete subindex that runs over a (cid:28)nite range, suh that it an

be onsidered as a vetor valued funtion in a (cid:28)nite dimensional omplex vetor spae.

In

omponent ψi represents a de(cid:28)nite spin state of the system. Nevertheless, our wave funtion
Φ(x) depends on more variables than spae-time variables. One we de(cid:28)ne later the omplete

ommuting set of observables to obtain, in terms of their simultaneous eigenvetors, an or-

thonormal basis for the Hilbert spae of states, we shall (cid:28)nd that Φ(x) an be separated in two
parts. One part φ(t, r) depending on spae-time variables and another part χ that depends

on the remaining translation invariant kinematial variables, that in our ase will redue to

the veloity u and orientation α. It is this possible separation of our wave funtion that will

produe the emergene of the di(cid:27)erent omponents of the usual formalism.

3.1.1 Transformation of the wave funtion

To see how the wave funtion transforms between inertial observers, and therefore to obtain

its transformation equations under the kinematial groups, let us onsider that O and O′
two inertial observers related by means of a transformation g

G, suh that the kinematial

are

∈

variables transform as:

x′i = f i(x, g).
If observer O onsiders that the system follows the path ¯x(τ ), then it follows for O′
path ¯x′(τ ) = f (¯x(τ ), g) and beause the ation along lassial paths transforms aording to
Eq. (1.28), the probability amplitude for observer O′

is just

where the last phase fator is independent of the integration path. If we add all probability

amplitudes of this form, it turns out that Feynman's kernel transforms as:

K ′(x′

2) = K(x1, x2) exp

i
~ (α(g; x2)

−

α(g; x1))

.

(cid:26)
If information onerning the initial point x1 is lost, the wave funtion transforms as the part
related to the variables x2 , up to an arbitrary funtion on G,

(cid:27)

Φ′(x′(x)) = Φ′(gx) = Φ(x) exp

where θ(g) is some funtion de(cid:28)ned on G but independent of x.

Sine our system is somewhere in X spae, the probability of (cid:28)nding the system anywhere is
X . If we de(cid:28)ne

interpreted as the probability of (cid:28)nding the system inside the volume element dµ(x) around

it is su(cid:30)ient for the onservation of probability to assume that the measure to be de(cid:28)ned µ(x)

is group invariant. In that ase, equation (3.7) implies also that inertial observers measure

loally the same probability. This will have strong onsequenes about the possibility of invari-

ane of the formalism under arbitrary hanges of phase of the wave funtion. But the phase

an be hanged in a di(cid:27)erent manner at di(cid:27)erent points x. We an use this fat to further

impose the loal gauge invariane of the theory. It must be remarked that this arbitrary hange

of phase β(x) is not only a phase on spae-time, but rather on the whole kinematial spae

of the system and this enlarges the possibilities of analyzing di(cid:27)erent transformation groups

that an be more general than the original kinematial groups, beause they at on a larger

manifold.

Consequently, the Hilbert spae H whose unit rays represent the pure states of the system
is the spae of squared-integrable funtions L2(X, µ) de(cid:28)ned on the kinematial spae X , µ(x)

being an invariant measure suh that the salar produt on H is de(cid:28)ned as

(3.8)

Φ∗(x) being the omplex onjugate funtion of Φ(x). There is an arbitrariness in the eletion
of the invariant measure µ(x) but this will be guided by physial arguments. Nevertheless, the

invariane ondition will restrit the possible measures to be used.

3.1.2 Representation of Observables

Wigner's theorem,

2, 3

implies that to every symmetry g

G of a ontinuous group, there

∈

exists a one to one mapping of unit rays into unit rays that is indued on H by a unitary
operator U(g) de(cid:28)ned up to a phase that maps a wave funtion de(cid:28)ned on x into an arbitrary
wave funtion of the image unit ray in x′

. The Relativity Priniple is a strong symmetry

of physial systems that de(cid:28)nes the equivalene between the set of inertial observers whose

spae-time measurements are related by means of a transformation of a kinematial group G.

Now, if we interpret Φ(x) as the wave funtion that desribes the state of the system for the
observer O and Φ′(x) for O′

, then we have

U(g)Φ(x) = Φ′(x) = Φ(g−1x) exp

relations of the initial group G where they ome from, but rather the ommutation relations of
a entral extension of G. The group representation is not a true representation but a pro jetive

Sine Φ(x) is arbitrary, we have a pro jetive unitary representation of the group G haraterized

For both Galilei and Poinaré partiles the kinematial spae is the ten-dimensional mani-

fold spanned by the variables (t, r, u, α), t being the time, r the harge position, u the veloity
and α the orientation of the partile. Thus in the quantum formalism the wave funtion of
the most general elementary partile is a squared-integrable funtion Φ(t, r, u, α) of these

kinematial variables. For point partiles, the kinematial spae is just the four-dimensional

spae-time, so that wave funtions are only funtions of time and position, but spinning par-

tiles will have to depend on the additional variables like veloity and orientation. The spin

struture will thus be related to these additional variables.

3.1.3 Nonrelativisti spinning partiles. Bosons

Now let us apply the formalism to the most interesting ase of spinning partiles. Let us

onsider next Galilei partiles with (anti)orbital spin. This orresponds for example to systems

for whih X =

as the quantum mehanial spin operator.

We see however, that the angular momentum operator J is split into two ommuting terms
r
P and Z . They both ommute with H , but the (cid:28)rst one is not invariant under spae
translations. The Z operators are angular momentum operators that only di(cid:27)erentiate the
wave funtion with respet to the veloity variables, and onsequently ommute with H and

P , and although it is not the true Galilei invariant spin operator, we an (cid:28)nd simultaneous
and Z3 . Beause the Z operators
eigenstates of the three ommuting operators H
only a(cid:27)et the wave funtion in its dependene on u variables, we an hoose funtions with
the variables separated in the form Φ(t, r, u) =

The spae-time dependent wave funtion ψi(t, r), satis(cid:28)es Shroedinger's equation and is un-
oupled with the spin part χ(u).
Due to the struture of Z 2

in terms of the u variables, whih is that of an orbital angular

For the enter of mass observer, S = Z and both angular momentum operators are the
same. But for an arbitrary observer, Z operators do not ommute with the boosts generators so
that its absolute value is not Galilei invariant, while S is. But the splitting of the wave funtion

into a multiple-omponent funtion that re(cid:29)ets its spin struture is an intrinsi property that

an be done in any frame.

It turns out that if for an arbitrary observer Z is not the spin of the system, r

P is
not the onserved orbital angular momentum, beause r does not represent the position of the

×

enter of mass of the partile.

When there is an interation with an external eletromagneti (cid:28)eld, equation (3.29) is

satis(cid:28)ed for the mehanial parts Hm = H

CHAPTER 3. QUANTIZATION OF THE MODELS

To desribe orientation we an think of the three orthogonal unit vetors ei , i = 1, 2, 3

linked to the body, similarly as in a rigid rotator. If initially they are taken parallel to the

spatial Cartesian axis of the laboratory inertial frame, then their nine omponents onsidered

by olumns de(cid:28)ne an orthogonal rotation matrix Rij(α) that desribes the triad evolution with
the initial ondition Rij(t = 0) = δij .

Now, kinematial variables t, r and ρ transform under G in the form
t′(τ ) = t(τ ) + b,
r′(τ ) = R(α)r(τ ) + vt(τ ) + a,

To desribe fermions, the lassial partiles must neessarily have ompat orientation

variables as kinematial variables, otherwise no spin 1/2 values an be obtained when the

lassial spin is related only to the zitterbewegung.

3.2 Appendix: Spinors

In this setion of mathematial ontent we shall review the main properties of spinors, in

partiular those onneted with the possible representation of the wave funtion to desribe

spin 1/2 partiles. We shall desribe the representations in terms of eigenfuntions of the

di(cid:27)erent ommuting spin operators. But it must be remarked that in addition to the spin

operators in the laboratory frame we also have spin operators in the body frame, beause our

general spinning partile has orientation, and therefore, a loal Cartesian frame linked to its

motion. This produes the result that for a spin 1/2 partile the wave funtion neessarily is

a four-omponent ob jet.

The general wave funtion is a funtion of the ten kinematial variables, Φ(t, r, u, ρ), and
the spin part of the system related to the translation invariant kinematial variables u and ρ

is

where Y and W are given by

S = u

∇u and ∇ρ are respetively the gradient operators with respet to u and ρ variables. These
operators always ommute with the H = i~∂/∂t and P =
∇ operators, and therefore

they are translation invariant. This feature allows the separation of the general wave funtion

in terms of spae-time variables and veloity-orientation variables to desribe the translation

invariant properties of the system.

The above spin operators satisfy the ommutation relations

[Y , Y ] = i~Y ,

[W , W ] = i~W ,

[Y , W ] = 0,

(3.47)

and thus

[S, S] = i~S.

unit vetors ei , whose orientation in spae is desribed by variables ρ or α, then, if at initial

We see, by inspetion, that this result an also be obtained from the expression of W in (3.46),
ρ, followed by a global hange of sign. This is beause we desribe the
just by replaing ρ by −
orientation of the partile by vetor ρ in the laboratory frame from the ative viewpoint, i.e.,

with the laboratory referene frame (cid:28)xed. However, its orientation with respet to the body

frame is desribed by the motion of the laboratory frame, whose orientation for the body is

ρ, and the global hange of sign omes from the hange from the ative point of view to the

−

passive one. This is the di(cid:27)erene in the spin desription in one frame or another.

It satis(cid:28)es the following ommutation relations

[T , T ] =

i~T ,

[T , W ] = 0.

−

and in general all spin pro jetions on the body frame Ri , Mi and Ti , ommute with all the spin
pro jetions on the laboratory frame Si , Yi and Wi . This is in agreement with the quantum

mehanial unertainty priniple, beause spin omponents with respet to di(cid:27)erent frames are

ompatible observables.

To (cid:28)nd eigenstates of the spin operator we have to solve equations of the form:

S2χ(u, ρ) = s(s + 1)~2χ(u, ρ), S3χ(u, ρ) = m~χ(u, ρ).

But we also have the orientation of the partile, and therefore the spin pro jetions on the

body axes. These pro jetions ommute with S2
and S3 , and it is possible to hoose another
ommuting spin operator, like the T3 operator, and therefore our wave funtion an be taken
also as an eigenvetor of T3 ,

T3χ(u, ρ) = n~χ(u, ρ),

so that the omplete ommuting set of operators that desribe the spin struture must also

inlude spin pro jetions on the body axes.

The spin squared operator is

S2 = Y 2 + W 2 + 2Y

W ,

(3.52)

and we see from (3.47) that is expressed as the sum of three ommuting terms and its eigen-

vetors an be obtained as the simultaneous eigenvetors of the three ommuting operators on

the right-hand side of (3.52). Operators Y and W produe derivatives of the wave funtion
with respet to u and ρ variables, separately. Thus, eah χ(u, ρ) an again be separated as

and

Funtions Uj(u) are multiples of spherial harmonis de(cid:28)ned on the orientation of the
veloity vetor u, beause the Y operator has the struture of an orbital angular momentum
in terms of the u variables, and thus its eigenvalues are integer numbers. The global fator
left out is an arbitrary funtion depending on the absolute value of the veloity u.

It turns out that to (cid:28)nd the most general spinor is neessary to seek also solutions of the

Vj(ρ) part, depending on the orientation variables. This goal will be ahieved in the next

setion, where we onsider the ation of the rotation group on itself as a transformation group.

3.2.1 Spinor representation on SU(2)

We shall desribe now in detail the orientation part of the general wave funtion, V (ρ).
If there is no ontribution to spin from the zitterbewegung part Y , the spin operator (3.45)
redues to the W operator given in (3.46). To solve the orresponding eigenvalue equations

we shall (cid:28)rst represent the spin operators in spherial oordinates.

If we represent vetor ρ = tan(α/2)n = rn in spherial oordinates (r, θ, φ), with r =
=
tan(α/2) and θ and φ the usual polar and azimuth angles, respetively, then unit vetor n has
the Cartesian omponents given in (3.50). If from now on we take ~ = 1, the spin operators

C(φ) = eikφ

Ti operators, here the T± operate in the reverse diretion.

The important feature is that if the system has spin 1/2, although the s = 1/2 irreduible

representations of the rotation group are two-dimensional, to desribe the spin part of the

wave funtion we need a funtion de(cid:28)ned in the above four-dimensional omplex Hilbert spae,

beause to desribe orientation we attah some loal frame to the partile, and therefore in

Dira equation and analysis of Dira

4.1 Quantization of the u = c model

For Luxons we have the nine-dimensional homogeneous spae of the Poinaré group, spanned

by the ten variables (t, r, u, α) similarly as before, but now u is restrited to u = c. For this
system, sine u
= 0, we are desribing partiles with a irular internal orbital
·
motion at the onstant speed c.

˙u = 0 and ˙u

In the enter of mass frame, (see Fig.4.1) the enter of harge desribes a irle of radius

R0 = S/mc at the onstant speed c, the spin being orthogonal to the harge tra jetory plane
and a onstant of the motion in this frame. Let us onsider the quantization of this u = c

model whose dynamial equation is given by (2.126).

If we analyse this partile in the entre of mass frame it beomes a system of three degrees

of freedom. These are the x and y oordinates of the point harge on the plane and the phase
α of the rotation of the body axis with angular veloity ω . But this phase is the same as the

phase of the orbital motion, as we shall see later, and beause this motion is a irle of onstant

radius only one degree of freedom is left, for instane the x oordinate. In the entre of mass

frame the system is equivalent to a one-dimensional harmoni osillator of angular frequeny

ω = mc2/S in its ground state.

Identi(cid:28)ation of the ground energy of the one-dimensional harmoni osillator ~ω/2 with
the rest energy of the system in the enter of mass frame +mc2
, for H > 0 partiles, implies
that the lassial onstant parameter S = ~/2. All Lagrangian systems de(cid:28)ned with this

kinematial spae, irrespetive of the partiular Lagrangian we hoose, have this behaviour

and represent spin 1/2 partiles when quantized.

the wave funtion of the system is a funtion Φ(t, r, u, ρ) of these kinematial variables. For

the Poinaré group all exponents and thus all gauge funtions on homogeneous spaes are

equivalent to zero, and the Lagrangians for free partiles an thus be taken stritly invariant.

and where the di(cid:27)erential operators ∇u and ∇ρ are the orresponding gradient operators with
respet to the u and ρ variables as in the Galilei ase. The operator S is not a onstant of the

motion even for the free partile, and although it is not the angular momentum of the system

with respet to its enter of mass we keep this notation beause it is the equivalent to Dira's

spin operator. Of ourse, it redues to the true spin S in the enter of mass frame.

In the above representation, H and P only di(cid:27)erentiate the wave funtion with respet to time
t and position r , respetively. Sine the spin operator S operates only on the veloity and

orientation variables, it ommutes with the Klein-Gordon operator (4.8). Thus, we an (cid:28)nd

simultaneous eigenfuntions of (4.8), S2

, and S3 . This allows us to try solutions in separate

variables so that the wave funtion an be written

Φ(t, r, u, ρ) =

ψi(t, r)χi(u, ρ),

i
X
where ψi(t, r) are the spae-time omponents and the χi(u, ρ) represent the internal spin

struture. Consequently

i.e., spae-time omponents satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation, while the internal struture

Eigenfuntions of the above type have been found in Setion 3.2, in partiular we are interested

in solutions that give rise to spin 1/2 partiles. These solutions, whih are also eigenvetors of
the spin pro jetion on the body axis T3 , beome a four-omponent wave funtion.
For spin 1/2 partiles, if we take (cid:28)rst for simpliity eigenfuntions χ(ρ) of S2

with eigenvalue

1/2, then sine the total spin has to be 1/2, the orbital zitterbewegung part Y = u
U an
only ontribute with spherial harmonis of value y = 0 and y = 1. This means that we an
(cid:28)nd at least two di(cid:27)erent kinds of elementary partiles of spin 1/2, one haraterized by the
singlet y = 0 (lepton?) and another by y = 1 (quark?) in three possible states aording
to the omponent y3 . If we all to the spin part Y the olour, we an have olourless and
oloured systems of spin 1/2. The three di(cid:27)erent olours y3 are unobservable beause the Ψi
states (3.76-3.79) are eigenstates of S3 and T3 but not eigenstates of Y3 . Nevertheless this

×

interpretation of this spin part as representing the olour, as in the standard model, is still

unlear and will be disussed in more detail in the forthoming workshop Spin05 next week.

For y = 0, the spin 1/2 funtions χi(ρ) are linear ombinations of the four Φi funtions
(3.63)-(3.66) and in the ase y = 1 they are linear ombinations of the four Ψi of (3.76)-(3.79),

suh that the fator funtion in front of the spherial harmonis is 1 beause for this model

u = c is a onstant. It turns out that the Hilbert spae that desribes the internal struture
of this partile is isomorphi to the four-dimensional Hilbert spae C4

angular veloity of the internal orbital motion. This time evolution of the observables ei is

the orret one if assumed to be a rotating left-handed system of vetors as shown in Figure

4.2-(a). It is for this reason that we onsidered at the beginning of this hapter that the body

frame rotates with the same angular veloity as the orbital motion of the harge.

To be onsistent with the above onsideration as 3ei as unit vetors, this means that the
spin in the enter of mass frame should be along 3e3 . This is the ase for the upper omponents
while for the lower omponents (whih in this representation orrespond to H < 0 states) the

orientation is the opposite. This means that for partiles the orresponding set of axis forms

a left handed system while for antipartiles they behave as a right handed system, showing a

lear hirality di(cid:27)erene between partiles and antipartiles.

We an similarly obtain Dira's equation in the ase of zitterbewegung y = 1, by using the

set of matries (4.16) instead of (4.15), beause they are multiples of eah other and only some

but this orresponds to a partile of of H < 0 suh that the relative orientation of spin, veloity

and position, given by equation (2.127) agrees with the motion depited in this (cid:28)gure.

A Dira partile is a mehanial system whose intrinsi attributes are mass m > 0 and
spin ~/2. We also see that the sign of H is also Poinaré invariant and it is also an intrinsi
property whih establishes two di(cid:27)erent systems of the same value of m and S . The system
with H > 0 is alled the partile and the other with H < 0 the antipartile. The value of

the mass attribute is introdued by hand. To haraterize its interation with an external

eletromagneti (cid:28)eld, we also introdue by hand another intrinsi property the eletri harge

e, loated at the point r . This implies that in addition to the mehanial properties m and S
the system has as eletromagneti properties the eletri harge e and beause of the harge

loation separated from its enter of mass and its motion at the speed of light, an eletri

dipole moment d and a magneti moment µ, respetively. The eletri harge an also have

The P CT transformation transforms partile into antipartile and onversely, while keeping
invariant the mehanial attributes m and S and the eletromagneti attributes µ and d. The
P CT invariane of the system establishes a relationship between the sign of H and the sign
of e, although an indeterminay exists in the eletion of the sign of the harge of the partile.
The produt eH is P CT invariant.

This implies that partile and antipartile have a magneti moment and an osillating

eletri dipole in a plane orthogonal to the spin. One the spin diretion is (cid:28)xed, the magneti

moment of both have the same relative orientation with the spin, either parallel or antiparallel,

aording to the eletion of the sign of the eletri harge. The eletri dipole moment osillates

leftwards for partiles and rightwards for antipartiles whih shows a di(cid:27)erene between them

whih is alled hirality.

If as usual we all the eletron to the system of negative eletri

harge the partile, the above P CT transformation transforms the system (a) of (cid:28)gure 4.6 into
the system (b). If what we all the partile is of positive eletri harge, then the spin and

magneti moment are opposite to eah other for both partile and antipartile.

However, to our knowledge no expliit diret measurement of the relative orientation be-

tween spin and magneti moment of the free eletron, an be found in the literature although

very high preision experiments are performed to obtain the absolute value of g , the gyromag-

Rb

atoms have one eletron at the level 5s. Its nuleus has spin 3/2 and the ground state

of the atom has a total spin 1, and therefore the outer eletron has its spin in the opposite

diretion to the spin of the nuleus. The magneti moment of the atom is basially the magneti

moment of this outer eletron beause the inner shells are full and the magneti moment of

the nuleus is relatively smaller.

Ultraold Rb

atoms in an external magneti (cid:28)eld will be oriented with their magneti

moments pointing along the (cid:28)eld diretion. If in this diretion we send a beam of irularly

polarized photons of su(cid:30)ient energy ∼

6.8GHz to produe the orresponding hyper(cid:28)ne tran-

sition to (cid:29)ip the eletron spin in the opposite diretion and thus leaving the atom in a spin

2 state, only those photons with the spin opposite to the spin of the outer eletron will be

absorbed. Measuring the spin orientation of the irularly polarized beam will give us the spin

orientation of the eletron thus showing its relationship with the magneti moment orientation.

Now the task is to hek also the relative orientation for positrons.

4.2.2 Chirality

The lassial model whih satis(cid:28)es Dira's equation when quantized gives rise to two possi-

ble physial systems of H > 0 and H < 0. The H > 0 is usually alled the partile. Aording

to the previous analysis the internal motion of the harge takes plae on a plane orthogonal to

the spin diretion and in a leftward sense when we (cid:28)x as positive the spin diretion. For the

antipartile the motion is rightwards. For partiles, the loal orientable frame of unit vetors

ei behaves as a left handed system rotating with an angular veloity in the opposite diretion

to the spin, while for antipartiles it an be onsidered as a right handed one.

If we should have started the analysis by onsidering (cid:28)rst the antipartile, then in order

to get the same Pauli-Dira representation as before we have to onsider the body axis as the

ones depited in (cid:28)gure 4.7, i.e., in the opposite diretion to the ones we hose before and this

leads by the same arguments that the γµ

Matter is left and antimatter is right in this kind of models as far as the harge motion and

the rotation of the loal body frame are onerned, so that partiles and antipartiles show a

lear hirality.

Although the loal motion of the harge, whih takes plae in a region of order of Compton's

wavelength, is probably physially unobservable, this motion orresponds nevertheless to the

osillation of the instantaneous eletri dipole moment, whih osillates at very high frequeny,

but its sense of motion, one the spin diretion is (cid:28)xed, re(cid:29)ets this di(cid:27)erene between partile

and antipartile. This eletri dipole motion is independent of whether the partile is positively

or negatively harged.

Similarly it an be generated by the following four observables, for instane: S1 , S2 , T1 and
T2 . In fat by (4.56) and (4.59) we obtain S3 and T3 respetively and by (4.57), the remaining

elements.

Classially, the internal orientation of an eletron is haraterized by the knowledge of the

omponents of the body frame (ei)j , i, j = 1, 2, 3 that altogether onstitute an orthogonal

matrix. To ompletely haraterize in a unique way this orthogonal matrix we need at least

four of these omponents. In the quantum version, the knowledge of four (ei)j matries and by

making use of (4.52)-(4.59), allows us to reover the remaining elements of the omplete Dira

algebra. It is in this sense that internal orientation of the eletron ompletely haraterizes its

internal struture. Dira's algebra of translation invariant observables of the eletron an be

generated by the orientation operators.

The g = 2 gyromagneti ratio of the eletron was onsidered for years a suess of Dira's

found g = 1 for spin 1 partiles and this led Belinfante

to onjeture that the gyromagneti ratio for elementary systems is g = 1/s, irrespetive of
the value s of its spin. He showed this to be true for quantum systems of spin 3/2, and a

few years later the onjeture was analyzed and heked by Moldauer and Case

to be right

5

for any half-integer spin, and by Tumanov

6

for the value s = 2. In all these ases a minimal

eletromagneti oupling was assumed.

made the predition g = 2 for the intermediate bosons of the weak interations
when analyzing the interation of W bosons with the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld by requiring a
good high-energy behavior of the sattering amplitude. The disovery of the harged W ±
spin 1 bosons with g = 2, ontraditory to Belinfante's onjeture, orroborated Weinberg's
predition and raised the question as to whether g = 2 for any elementary partile of arbitrary

spin.

Jakiw

has given another dynamial argument on(cid:28)rming that the gyromagneti ratio of

spin-1 (cid:28)elds is g = 2, provided a noneletromagneti gauge invariane is aepted. He also
gives some ad ho argument for s = 2 (cid:28)elds, onsistent with the g = 2 presription.

CHAPTER 5. SOME SPIN FEATURES

is to give a kinematial desription of the gyromagneti ratio of elementary partiles

whih

10

is based upon the double ontent of their spin operator struture.

The general struture of the quantum mehanial angular momentum operator in either

relativisti or nonrelativisti approah is

where the spin operator is

and ∇u is the gradient operator with respet to the veloity variables and W is a linear
di(cid:27)erential operator that operates only on the orientation variables α and therefore ommutes
with the other. For instane, in the ρ = n tan(α/2) parametrization W is written as

J = r

+ S = r

P + S,

× ∇ρ + ρ(ρ

· ∇ρ)] .

~

2i

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

The (cid:28)rst part in (5.2), related to the zitterbewegung spin, has integer eigenvalues beause

it has the form of an orbital angular momentum in terms of the u variables. Half-integer
eigenvalues ome only from the operator (5.3). This operator W takes into aount the hange

of orientation, i.e., the rotation of the partile.

We have seen in either relativisti or non-relativisti examples that if the only spin ontent

of the partile S is related to the zitterbewegung part Z = u

U , then the relationship

×

between the magneti moment and zitterbewegung spin is given by

dk
dt
i.e., with a normal up to a sign gyromagneti ratio g = 1. If the eletron has a gyromagneti
ratio g = 2, this implies neessarily that another part of the spin is oming from the angular

veloity of the body, but produing no ontribution to the magneti moment.

Therefore for the eletron, both parts W and Z ontribute to the total spin. But the
W part is related to the angular variables that desribe orientation and does not ontribute
to the separation k between the enter of harge and the enter of mass. It turns out that

the magneti moment of a general partile is still related to the motion of the harge by the

expression (5.4), i.e., in terms of the Z part but not to the total spin S . It is preisely when we

try to express the magneti moment in terms of the total spin that the onept of gyromagneti

ratio arises.

Now, let us assume that both Z and W terms ontribute to the total spin S with their

lowest admissible values.

For Dira's partiles, the lassial zitterbewegung is a irular motion at the speed of light

of radius R = S/mc and angular frequeny ω = mc2/S , in a plane orthogonal to the total spin.
The total spin S and the Z part, are both orthogonal to this plane and an be either parallel
or antiparallel. Let us de(cid:28)ne the gyromagneti ratio by Z = gS . For the lowest admissible
values of the quantized spins z = 1 and w = 1/2 in the opposite diretion this gives rise to a
total s = 1/2 perpendiular to the zitterbewegung plane and then g = 2.

For s = 1 partiles the lowest possible values ompatible with the above relative orientations
are z = 2 and w = 1 in the opposite diretion, thus obtaining again g = 2. The possibility
z = 1 and w = 0 is forbidden in the relativisti ase beause neessarily w
= 0 to desribe

vetor bosons with a multiomponent wave-funtion.

Instantaneous eletri dipole

The internal motion of the harge of the eletron in the enter of mass frame is a irle at

the speed of light. The position of the harge in this frame is related to the total spin by eq.

(2.126), i.e.,

where S is the total onstant spin and u = dk/dt, with u = c is the veloity of the harge. In

addition to this motion there is a rotation of a loal frame linked to the partile that gives rise

k =

to some angular veloity, but this rotation has no e(cid:27)et on the eletri dipole struture. (See

Fig. 5.1 where the angular veloity and the loal frame are not depited).

Figure 5.1: Eletron harge motion in the C.M. frame.

Now, from the point of view of the enter of mass observer, the partile behaves as though

it has a magneti moment related to the partile urrent by the usual lassial expression

orbital term k
values and whih for spin 1/2 and spin 1 harged partiles is twie the total spin S , giving rise

beause it is expressed in terms of a relative position vetor k. It an never be interpreted as

some kind of (cid:29)utuation of a spherial symmetry of a harge distribution. Even in this kind

of model, it is not neessary to talk about harge distributions, beause all partile attributes

are de(cid:28)ned at single points.

In his original 1928 artile,

Dira obtains that the Hamiltonian for the eletron has, in

addition to the Hamiltonian of a free point partile of mass m, two new terms that in the

presene of an external eletromagneti (cid:28)eld are

and α = γ0γ,

i.e., Σ is expressed in terms of σ Pauli-matries and α is Dira's veloity operator when written

in terms of Dira's gamma matries.

We shall show that the quantum ounterpart of expression (5.6) is in fat the eletri

dipole term of Dira's Hamiltonian (5.7). The remaining part of this setion is to onsider the

representation of the `ross' produt in (5.6) in terms of the matrix (or geometri) produt of

the elements of Dira's algebra that represent the quantum version of the above observables,

so that a short explanation to properly interpret these observables as elements of a Cli(cid:27)ord

algebra is given in what follows.

Both, veloity operator u = cα and spin operator S are bivetors in Dira's algebra,

onsidered as elements of the Geometri or Cli(cid:27)ord algebra of spae-time in the sense of

Hestenes.

12

In fat, Dira's alpha matries are written as a produt of two gamma matries αi = γ0γi
and also the spin omponents Sj = (i~/2) γkγl , j, k, l yli 1, 2, 3, and where the four gamma
matries, γµ , µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 are interpreted as the four basi vetors of Minkowski's spae-time
that generate Dira's Cli(cid:27)ord algebra. They satisfy γµ ·
1,

γν = ηµν , i.e., γ2

0 = 1 and γ2

i =

−

where the dot means the inner produt in Dira's Cli(cid:27)ord algebra. We thus see that veloity

and spin belong to the even subalgebra of Dira's algebra and therefore they also belong to Pauli

algebra or geometri algebra of three-dimensional spae. Under spatial inversions γ0 →
γi → −

γ0 and
γi , the veloity operator hanges its sign and it is thus a spatial vetor, while the spin

is invariant under this transformation as it orresponds to a spatial bivetor or pseudovetor.

The relationship between the ross produt and the outer and inner produt of two vetors

a and b in Pauli algebra is,

where ∧ represents the symbol for the outer produt in geometri algebra, the imaginary unit
i represents the unit three-vetor or pseudosalar and ia is the dual bivetor of vetor a.

The inner produt of a vetor b and a bivetor A is expressed in terms of the geometri

produt in the form

If we hoose a basis of vetors and pseudovetors as in Fig. 5.2, where the double-lined

ob jets of part (b) represent the dual vetors of the orresponding spatial bivetors, and express
in these bases the observables of Fig. 5.1, then the spatial veloity vetor u = cγ0γ2 and the
pseudovetor S = (~/2)γ2γ3 and therefore, using (5.8) and (5.9) we get

As a onsequene of the zitterbewegung and therefore of the separation between the enter

of mass and enter of harge, we shall see that spinning partiles an have a non-vanishing

rossing of potential barriers.

Let us onsider a spinning partile with spin of (anti)orbital type, as desribed in Setion

uniform (cid:28)eld region of potential V0 ontained between the grids or plates A, C and B .

In Figure 5.4 from a strit lassial viewpoint a spinless eletron stops at the dotted line

and is rejeted bakwards. But a lassial spinning eletron an ross the barrier provided its

kineti energy is above some minimum value, although below the top of the potential. This

minimum value depends on the separation between plates.

between the enter of harge and enter of mass. In the ase of irular internal motion, it

Figure 5.5: Kineti Energy during the rossing for the values a = b = 1.

With a = b = 1, and in energy units suh that the top of the barrier is 1, if we take an
initial kineti energy K below this threshold, K = m ˙q(0)2/2eV0 = 0.41 we obtain for the enter

of mass motion the graphi depited in Fig. 5.5, where is shown the variation of the kineti

energy of the partile K(q), with the enter of mass position during the rossing of the barrier.

There is always rossing with a kineti energy above this value. In Fig. 5.6, the same graphial

evolution with a = 1 and b = 10 and K = 0.9055 for a potential of 103

Volts in whih the

di(cid:27)erent stages in the evolution are evident. Below the initial values for the kineti energy of

0.4 and 0.9 respetively, the partile does not ross these potential barriers and it is rejeted

bakwards.

If in both examples the parameter a is ranged from 1 to 0.05, thus making the left slope
sharper, there is no appreiable hange in the rossing energy, so that with a = 1 held (cid:28)xed
we an ompute the minimum rossing kineti energies for di(cid:27)erent b values, Kc(b).

To ompare this model with the quantum tunnel e(cid:27)et, let us quantize the system. In the

quantization of generalized Lagrangians developed in the Chapter 3, the wave funtion for this

If we onsider for the lassial spinning partile the same uniform distribution of partiles,

then, the funtion P (b) = 1

Kc(b), where Kc(b) is the minimum dimensionless kineti energy

−

for rossing omputed before, represents the ratio of the partiles that with kineti energy

below the top of the potential ross the barrier beause of the spin ontribution.

This funtion P (b), is also depited in Fig. 5.7. We see that for the di(cid:27)erent potentials

shown in that (cid:28)gure the lassial average probability of rossing is smaller than the quantum

one, but for stronger potentials this lassial probability, oming from the spin ontribution,

beomes relatively important.

Beause the tunnel e(cid:27)et is a funtion of ~ and the spin of elementary partiles is also
of order of ~ it is very di(cid:30)ult to separate from the outome of a real experiment involving

elementary partiles, whih part is due to a pure quantum e(cid:27)et and whih is the ontribution

to rossing oming from the spin struture. From (5.19) and (5.20) it is lear that the quantum

probability of tunneling is independent of the spin.

To test experimentally this ontribution, it will be neessary to perform separate experi-

ments with partiles of the same mass and harge but with di(cid:27)erent values of the spin. Thus,

the di(cid:27)erene in the outome will be related to the spin ontribution. This an be aomplished

for instane, by using ions of the type A++
in a triplet (s = 1) state.

that ould be either in a singlet, (s = 0) state or

But if there exists a ontribution to rossing not inluded in the usual quantum mehanial

analysis we have to modify the quantum mehanial equations. To be onsistent with the

above analysis the Shroedinger-Pauli equation should be modi(cid:28)ed to inlude the additional

eER cos ωt, where E is the external eletri (cid:28)eld and
eletri dipole term. A term of the form −
R the radius of the zitterbewegung, should be onsidered to solve the orresponding quantum
wave funtion. This term is of the order of the separation R between the enter of mass and

enter of harge, whih is responsible for the lassial rossing. This additional eletri dipole

term is already inluded in Dira's equation but is suppressed when taking the low veloity

limit, as it orresponds to this low energy example. Nevertheless, although this is a low energy

proess and the time average value of the eletri dipole vanishes, there are very high (cid:28)eld

gradients.

We see that the separation between the enter of mass and enter of harge that gives

rise to the spin struture of this partile model justi(cid:28)es that this system an ross a potential

barrier even if its kineti energy is below the top of the potential.

5.3.1 Spin polarized tunneling

I like to point out the following ideas to disuss whether they an be useful in onnetion

with the interpretation of the magnetoresistane of polyrystaline (cid:28)lms. This is known in the

literature as the spin polarized tunneling.

16

The main feature of the (cid:16)lassial(cid:17) spin polarized tunneling we have seen in the previous

setion is not a matter of whether tunneling is lassial or not, beause this is a nonsense

question. Matter at this sale is interpreted under quantum mehanial rules. But if we use a

model of a lassial spinning partile that, when polarized orthogonal to the diretion of motion,

produes a rossing that is not predited by the Shroedinger-Pauli equation, it means that

this quantum mehanial equation is laking some term. The oupling term −

the magneti moment and magneti (cid:28)eld that gives rise to the Pauli equation, is inherited

from Dira's eletron theory. But Dira's equation also predits another term −

·

oupling of an instantaneous eletri dipole with the eletri (cid:28)eld. It is this osillating eletri

d

E , of the

dipole term that we believe is laking in quantum mehanial wave equations. In general, the

average value of this term in an eletri (cid:28)eld of smooth variation is zero. But in high intensity

(cid:28)elds or in intergranular areas in whih the e(cid:27)etive potentials are low, but their gradients

ould be very high, this average value should not be negligible.

The ondution of eletrons in synterized materials is ompletely di(cid:27)erent than the on-

dution on normal ondutors. The material is not a ontinuous rystal.

It is formed by

small grains that are bound together by the ation of some external pressure. If we an depit

roughly the eletri urrent (cid:29)ow, this is done by the jumping of eletrons from grain to grain,

through a tunneling proess in whih there is some estimated e(cid:27)etive potential barrier on-

(cid:28)ned in the gap between grains. Therefore these materials show in general a huge resistivity

when ompared with true ondutors.

The form of this potential is unknown. The simplest one is to assume a wall of thikness d,
the average separation between grains, and height h. But it an also be estimated as one of the

potentials of the former example. What we have shown previously is that for every potential

barrier, there is always a minimum energy, below the top of the potential, that eletrons above

that energy ross with probability 1 when polarized orthogonal to the motion, even within

a lassial interpretation. But this e(cid:27)et is not predited by (cid:16)normal(cid:17) quantum mehanis

beause tunneling is spin independent.

Now, let us assume that we are able to estimate some average e(cid:27)etive potential barrier in

the intergranular zone of this polyristaline material. If the orresponding minimum rossing

energy of this barrier for polarized eletrons is below the Fermi level, then, when we introdue

a magneti (cid:28)eld in the diretion of the (cid:28)lm and the magneti domains in the grains beome

polarized, all eletrons above that minimum energy of rossing will (cid:29)ow from grain to grain as

in a good ondutor, with a lassial probability 1. That's all. Here the di(cid:30)ulty is to estimate

properly this potential barrier and therefore the orresponding lassial rossing energy.

It an be argued that the presene of the magneti (cid:28)eld to polarize eletrons produes a

hange in the energy of partiles. Nevertheless, even for a magneti (cid:28)eld of the order of 1 Tesla

In this way we have a system of di(cid:27)erential

equations of the form (2.148, 2.149) in the relativisti ase or in the form (2.71, 2.72) in the

nonrelativisti, for eah partile. For instane, the external (cid:28)eld ating on harge e1 is replaed
by the Coulomb (cid:28)eld reated by the other harge e2 at the position of e1 , and simmilarly for the

other partile. The integration is performed numerially by means of the numerial integration

of mass frame. We send the partiles with their spins parallel and with a nonvanishing impat

parameter. In addition to the urly motion of their harges we an also depit the tra jetories of

their enter of masses. If we ompare this motion with the Coulomb interation of two spinless

eletrons oming from the same initial position and with the same veloity as the enter of mass

of the spinning eletrons we obtain the solid tra jetory marked with an arrow. Basially this

orresponds to the tra jetory of the enter of mass of eah spinning partile provided the two

partiles do not approah eah other below Compton's wave length. This an be understood

beause the average position of the enter of harge of eah partile aproximately oinides

with its enter of mass and as far as they do not approah eah other too muh the average

Coulomb fore is the same. The di(cid:27)erene omes out when we onsider a very deep interation

or very lose initial positions.

In Figure 5.9 we represent the initial positions for a pair of partiles with the spins parallel.

The initial separation a of their enter of masses is a distane below Compton's wave length.
We also onsider that initially the enter of mass of eah partile is moving with a veloity v

as depited. That spins are parallel is re(cid:29)eted by the fat that the internal motions of the

harges, represented by the oriented irles that surround the orresponding enter of mass,

have the same orientation. It must be remarked that the harge motion around its enter of

mass an be haraterised by a phase. The phases of eah partile are hosen opposite to eah

other. We also represent the repulsive Coulomb fore F omputed in terms of the separation
of the harges. This interating fore F has also been attahed to the orresponding enter of
mass, so that the net fore ating on point m2 is direted towards point m1 , and onversely. We

thus see there that a repulsive fore between the harges represents an atrative fore between

their enter of masses when loated at suh a short distane.

In Figure 5.10 we depit the evolution of the harges and masses of this two-eletron system

for a = 0.4λC and v = 0.004c during a short time interval. Figure 5.11 represents only the

motions of the enter of masses of both partiles for a longer time. It shows that the enter of

mass of eah partile remains in a bound region.

time

The evolution of the harges is not shown in this (cid:28)gure beause it blurs the piture but it

an be inferred from the previous (cid:28)gure. We have found bound motions at least for the range

0.01c. We an also obtain similar bound motions if the

di(cid:27)erent initial harge positions as the ones depited in Figure 5.9. This range for the relative

phase depends on a and v but in general the bound motion is more likely if the initial phases

of the harges are opposite to eah other.

We thus see that if the separation between the enter of mass and enter of harge of a

partile (zitterbewegung) is responsible for its spin struture then this atrative e(cid:27)et and also

a spin polarised tunneling e(cid:27)et an be easily interpreted.

Figure 5.11: Evolution of the enter of mass of both partiles for a larger time

A bound motion for lassial spinless eletrons is not possible. We an onlude that one

of the salient features of this example is the existene from the lassial viewpoint of bound

states for spinning eletron-eletron interation.

It is the spin struture whih ontributes

to the predition of new physial phenomena.

If two eletrons have their enter of masses

separated by a distane greater than Compton's wave length they always repel eah other as

in the spinless ase. But if two eletrons have their enter of masses separated by a distane less

than Compton's wave length they an form from the lassial viewpoint bound states provided

some initial onditions on their relative initial spin orientation, position of the harges and

enter of mass veloity are ful(cid:28)lled.

The example analysed gives just a lassial predition, not a quantum one, assoiated

to a model that satis(cid:28)es Dira's equation when quantised. The possible quantum mehanial

bound states if they exist, must be obtained from the orresponding analysis of two interating

quantum Dira partiles, bearing in mind that the lassial bound states are not forbiden from

the lassial viewpoint. Bound states for a hydrogen atom an exist from the lassial viewpoint

for any negative energy and arbitrary angular momentum. It is the quantum analysis of the

atom that gives the orret answer to the allowed bound states.

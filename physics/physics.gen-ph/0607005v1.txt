Abstract

A combined BCDE (Brans-Dicke and Einstein-Cartan) theory is developed through Raychaud-

huri’s equation, for inﬂationary scenario. It involves a variable cosmological constant, which de-

creases with time, jointly with energy density, cosmic pressure, shear and Hubble’s parameter,

while the scale factor, scalar ﬁeld and spin increase exponentially. Except for the spin component,

the ﬂuid goes in the limit, into a perfect ﬂuid.

COMBINED BRANS-DICKE-EINSTEIN-CARTAN
INFLATIONARY SOLUTION WITH
LAMBDA-TERM

Marcelo Samuel Berman

Einstein-Cartan’s gravitational theory, though not bringing vacuum solutions diﬀerent

than those in General Relativity theory, has an important rˆole, by tying macrophysics,

through gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena (i.e., involving constants G and c ),

with microphysics, though Planck’s constant, involving spin originated by torsion. Spin is

a subatomic integrant; it does not appear in macrophysics. This characteristic of Einstein-

Cartan’s gravitational theory, makes it a kind of bridge from Classical gravitational into

Quantum theory.

It is generally accepted that scalar tensor cosmologies play a central rˆole in the present

view of the very early Universe (Berman, 2006). The cosmological ”constant”, which rep-

resents quintessence,

is a time varying entity, whose origin remounts to Quantum the-

ory(Berman, 2006a). The ﬁrst, and most important scalar tensor theory was devised by

Brans and Dicke(1961). Afterwards, Dicke(1962) presented a new version of the theory,

where the ﬁeld equations resembled Einstein’s equations, but time, length, and inverse

mass, were scaled by a factor φ−

2 where φ stands for the scalar ﬁeld. Then, the energy

momentum tensor Tij

is augmented by a new term Λij , so that:

where Gij stands for Einstein’s tensor. The new energy tensor quantity, is given by:

In the above, ω is the coupling constant. The other equation is:

(1)

(3)

where (cid:3) is the generalized d’Alembertian, and T = T i

. It is useful to remember that

the energy tensor masses are also scaled by φ−

.

1979):

Relation (8) represents Raychaudhuri’s equation for a perfect ﬂuid. By the usual proce-

dure, we would ﬁnd the Raychaudhuri’s equation in the general case, involving shear (σij)

and vorticiy (̟ij); the acceleration of the ﬂuid is null for the present case, and then we ﬁnd:

3 ˙H + 3H 2 = 2 (̟2 − σ2) − 4πG (ρ + 3p + 4ρλ) + Λ

,

(9)

where Λ stands for a cosmological ”constant”. As we are mimicking Einstein’s ﬁeld

equations, Λ in (9) stands like it were a constant (see however, Berman, 2006, 2006a,

2006b, 2006c). Notice that, when we impose that the ﬂuid is not accelerating, this means

that the quadri-velocity is tangent to the geodesics, i.e., the only interaction is gravitational.

When Raychaudhuri’s equation is calculated for irrotational and non-accelerated ﬂuid,

taken care of Einstein-Cartan’s theory, combined with Brans-Dicke theory, the following

equation was found by us, based on the original calculation for Einstein-Cartan’s theory by

Raychaudhuri (1979):

3

3 ˙H + 3H 2 = −2σ2 − 4πG (ρ + 3p + 4ρλ) + Λ + 128π2S2

,

(10)

where S stands for the spin contents of the ﬂuid.

It is important to stress, that relation (10) is the same general relativistic equation, with

the additional spin term, which transforms it into Einstein-Cartan’s equation. When we

work a combined Einstein-Cartan’s and Brans-Dicke theory (BCDE theory), we would need

to calculate the new ﬁeld equations for the combined theory; a plausibility reasoning that

substitutes an otherwise lenghty calculation, is the following: the term with spin, as well as

it is added to the other general relativistic terms in equation (10), should be added equaly

to equation (9), because this is the Brans-Dicke equation in a general relativistic format.

Of course, the irrotational equation, means that we make ̟ = 0 in equation (9). This

equation is written in the unconventional format (Dicke, 1962), i.e., the alternative system

of equations. We could not write so simply equation (10) if the terms in it were those of

conventional Brans-Dicke theory.

Consider now exponential inﬂation, like we ﬁnd in Einstein’s theory:

R = R0eHt

Λ = 3H 2

,

.

and, as usual in General Relativity inﬂationary models,

(11)

(12)

For the time being, H is just a constant, deﬁned by H = ˙R

R . We shall see, when we go

back to conventional Brans-Dicke theory, that H is not the Hubble’s constant.

From (11), we ﬁnd H = H0 = constant.

A solution of Raychaudhuri’s equation (10), would be the following:

σ = σ0e−

ρ = ρ0e−

p = p0e−

;

φ = φ0e−

.

Λ = Λ0 = constant.

In the above, σ0 , φ0 , p0 , ρ0 and β are constants, and

β = −4H .

(14)

The ultimate justiﬁcation for this solution is that one ﬁnds a good solution in the con-

ventional units theory.

The spin of the Universe, S , has been identiﬁed (Berman, 2006d), with:

S = G−

1c3R2

.

(15)

Without going into details on the origin of relation (15), it suﬃces to state that this is

the Machian result (Berman, 2006d).

When we return to conventional units, we retrieve the following corresponding solution:

From the hypothesis of an expanding Universe, we have to impose:

¯H > 0

.

the constants:

Returning to Raychaudhuri’s equation, we have the following condition to be obeyed by

0 = −2πG [ρ0 + 3p0 + 4ρλ0] + 128π2G−

2R4
0

,

(25)

We now investigate the limit when

t −→ ∞ of the above formulae, having in mind

that, by checking that limit, we will know which ones increase or decrease with time; of

course, we can not stand with an inﬂationary period unless it takes only an extremely small
period of time. We shall supose that β = −4H < 0 .

We ﬁnd:

¯H = 0

¯R = ∞ ;

As we can check, the scale factor, spin, and the scalar ﬁeld, are time-increasing, while all

other elements of the model, namely, vorticity, shear, Hubble’s parameter, energy density,

cosmic pressure, and cosmological term, as described by the above relations, decay with

time. This being the case, shear is decaying, so that, after inﬂation, we retrieve a nearly

perfect ﬂuid, excepted the spin term:

inﬂation has the peculiarity of removing shear, but

not spin, from the model. It has to be remarked, that pressure and energy density obey a

perfect gas equation of state.

We have on purpose, left the solutions in terms of the negative constant β , in order

that the reader might compare the above results, with the corresponding pure Brans-Dicke

solution for the same problem, as in Berman(2006e).

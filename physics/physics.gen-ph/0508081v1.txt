Abstract

A longstanding question that has puzzled Physicists is the so called
gauge hierarchy problem, that is why is there such a wide gap between
the mass of a Planck particle, 10−5gms and the mass of a typical ele-
10−25gms. We show that the answer to this prob-
mentary particle
lem lies in a particular characterization of gravitation. This moreover
also provides a picture of a Planck scale underpinning for the entire
universe itself.

1 Introduction

In 1997 the author put forward a model in which particles are created ﬂuctu-
ationally in a phase transition from the background Zero Point Field or Dark
Energy. This model lead to dramatic consequences: The Universe would
be accelerating and expanding with a small cosmological constant. Besides,
several longstanding puzzling relations of the so called large number genre
which had no explanation whatsoever, were now deduceable from the theory.
At that time the accepted Standard Big Bang model predicted a dark matter
ﬁlled decelerating universe–in other words the exact opposite. In 1998 how-
ever the ﬁrst results were announced by Perlmutter, Kirshner and coworkers,
from a study of distant supernovae that the universe was indeed accelerat-
ing and expanding with a small cosmological constant, contrary to belief.
These conclusions were subsequently reconﬁrmed several times. This work

1

was the breakthrough of the year 1998 of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science [1] while Dark Energy itself was subsequently con-
ﬁrmed through the WMAP and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This in fact
was the breakthrough of the year 2003 [2].
To recapitulate the author’s model [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], we give a simple picture
and will return to the nuances later.
Our starting point is the all permeating Zero Point Field or the Dark En-
ergy, from which the elementary particles are created. As Wheeler put it [10],
“From the zero-point ﬂuctuations of a single oscillator to the ﬂuctuations of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld to geometrodynamic ﬂuctuations is a natural order
of progression...”
Let us consider, following Wheeler a harmonic oscillator in its ground state.
The probability amplitude is

for displacement by the distance x from its position of classical equilibrium.
So the oscillator ﬂuctuates over an interval

ψ(x) =

1/4

mω
π¯h (cid:19)

(cid:18)

e−(mω/2¯h)x2

∆x

(¯h/mω)1/2

∼

The electromagnetic ﬁeld is an inﬁnite collection of independent oscillators,
with amplitudes X1, X2 etc. The probability for the various oscillators to
have emplitudes X1, X2 and so on is the product of individual oscillator
amplitudes:

ψ(X1, X2,

) = exp[

(X 2

)]

· · ·

wherein there would be a suitable normalization factor. This expression gives
the probability amplitude ψ for a conﬁguration B(x, y, z) of the magnetic ﬁeld
that is described by the Fourier coeﬃcients X1, X2,
or directly in terms
of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration itself by

P being a normalization factor. Let us consider a conﬁguration where the
magnetic ﬁeld is everywhere zero except in a region of dimension l, where it
∆B. The probability amplitude for this conﬁguration
is of the order of

So the energy of ﬂuctuation in a region of length l is given by ﬁnally [10, 11,
12]

∼
In the above if l is taken to be the Compton wavelength of a typical elemen-
tary particle, then we recover its energy mc2, as can be easily veriﬁed.
It may be mentioned that Einstein himself had believed that the electron
was a result of such a condensation from the background electromagnetic
ﬁeld (Cf.[13, 8] for details). We will return to this point again. We also take
the pion to represent a typical elementary particle, as in the literature.

To proceed, as there are N

1080 such particles in the universe, we get

∼

Nm = M

where M is the mass of the universe.

In the following we will use N as the sole cosmological parameter.

Equating the gravitational potential energy of the pion in a three dimen-
sional isotropic sphere of pions of radius R, the radius of the universe, with
the rest energy of the pion, we can deduce the well known relation [14, 15, 16]

R

≈

GM
c2

where M can be obtained from (1).

We now use the fact that given N particles, the ﬂuctuation in the particle
number is of the order √N[16, 17, 4, 5, 18, 3], while a typical time interval
¯h/mc2, the Compton time, the fuzzy interval we
for the ﬂuctuations is
encountered in the previous Chapter. We will come back to this point later
in this Chapter, in the context of the minimum Planck scale: Particles are
created and destroyed - but the ultimate result is that √N particles are
created. So we have, as we saw brieﬂy earlier,

whence on integration we get, (remembering that we are almost in the con-
tinuum region),

T =

Later we will analyze in a little greater detail, the above and subsequent
relations and continue with this preliminary treatment. We can easily verify
that the equation is indeed satisﬁed where T is the age of the universe. Next
by diﬀerentiating (2) with respect to t we get

√N

where H in (5) can be identiﬁed with the Hubble Constant, and using (2) is
given by,

Equation (1), (2) and (4) show that in this formulation, the correct mass,
radius, Hubble constant and age of the universe can be deduced given N as
the sole cosmological or large scale parameter. Equation (6) can be written
as

Equation (7) has been empirically known as an ”accidental” or ”mysterious”
relation. As observed by Weinberg[19], this is unexplained: it relates a single
cosmological parameter H to constants from microphysics. We will touch
upon this micro-macro nexus again. In our formulation, equation (7) is no
longer a mysterious coincidence but rather a consequence.

As (6) and (5) are not exact equations but rather, order of magnitude
relations, it follows, on diﬀerentiating (5) that a small cosmological constant

is allowed such that

This is consistent with observation and shows that
is very small – this
has been a puzzle, the so called cosmological constant problem alluded to,
because in conventional theory, it turns out to be huge [20]. Some 1070 times
higher in fact! But it poses no problem in this formulation.

To proceed we observe that because of the ﬂuctuation of

√N (due to
the ZPF), there is an excess electrical potential energy of the electron, which
infact we have identiﬁed as its inertial energy. That is [4, 16],

where in (10), we have used (4). This was the relation we encountered in the
previous chapter. Following Dirac (cf.also [22]) we treat G as the variable,
rather than the quantities m, l, c and ¯h (which we will call micro physical
constants) because of their central role in atomic (and sub atomic) physics.
Next if we use G from (10) in (6), we can see that

Thus apart from the fact that H has the same inverse time dependance on
T as G, (11) shows that given the microphysical constants, and N, we can
deduce the Hubble Constant also, as from (11) or (6).
Using (1) and (2), we can now deduce that

Next (9) and (4) give,

(12) and (13) are consistent with observation.
With regard to the time variation of G, the issue is debatable and model
dependent. Measurements on the earth and of the planets, and perhaps
10−10, though values 10−11
most accurate of all, Pulsars indicates a value
and 10−12 have also appeared in some studies [23, 24].

2 The Gauge Hierarchy Problem

A long standing puzzle has been the so called Gauge Hierarchy Problem.
This deals with the fact that the Planck mass is some 1020 times the mass of
an elementary particle, for example Gauge Bosons or Protons or Electrons
(in the large number sense). Why is there such a huge gap?
It is well known that the Planck mass is deﬁned by [10, 8]

mP =

1/2

¯hc
G !

 

∼

10−5gm

(14)

Alternatively the Planck mass deﬁnes a black hole having the Schwarzchild
radius given by

2GmP

10−33cm

(15)

c2 ∼

lP ∼
In (2) lP is the Planck length. Interestingly Rosen [25] has shown that the
Planck mass given in (14) is an universe in itself, that is a black hole given
by (15).
While mP is
∼
10−25gms. (As mentioned in this order of magnitude sense it does not make
much diﬀerence, if the elementary particle is an electron or pion or proton
(Cf.ref.[10])).
We now recall that as already shown we have [4, 5, 26, 9]

10−5gms, a typical elementary particle has a mass m

∼

∼

1080 is the well known number of elementary particles in the
In (16) N
universe, which features in the Weyl-Eddington relations as also the Dirac
Cosmology.
What is interesting about (16) is that it shows gravitation as a distributional
eﬀect over all the N particles in the universe [26, 9].
Let us rewrite (15) in the form

remembering that the Planck length is also the Compton length of the Planck
mass. (Interestingly an equation like (15) or (17) also follows from Sakharov’s
treatment of gravitation [27].) A division of (4) and (17) yields

1020 between the Planck mass

Equation (18) immediately gives the ratio
and the mass of an elementary particle.
It is interesting that in (16) if we take N
1, then we recover (17). So
while the Planck mass in the spirit of Rosen’s isolated universe and the
Schwarzchild black hole uses the gravitational interaction in isolation, as seen
from (16), elementary particles are involved in the gravitational interaction
with all the remaining particles in the universe.
Finally rememebring that Gm2
from (16)

e2, as can also be seen from (5), we get

∼

P ∼
e2

Gm2 ∼

√ ¯N

Equation (19) is the otherwise empirically well known electromagnetism-
gravitation coupling constant ratio, but here it is deduced from the theory.
It may be remarked that one could attempt an explanation of (18) from the
point of view of SuperSymmetry or Brane theory, but these latter have as
yet no experimental validation [28].

3 The Planck Scale

It is now generally accepted in various Quantum Gravity approaches as also
Quantum Super String Theory or M-Theory that the universe has a minimum
scale–the Planck scale.
It is well known, and this was realized by Planck
himself that there is an absolute minimum scale in the universe, and this is,

Yet what we encounter in the real world is, not the Planck scale, but the
elementary particle Compton scale. The explanation given for this is that the
very high energy Planck scale is moderated by the Uncertainty Principle. The
question which arises is, exactly how does this happen? We will now present
an argument to show how the Planck scale leads to the real world Compton
scale, via ﬂuctuations and the modiﬁcation of the Uncertainty Principle.

mP ∼

There are certain interesting properties associated with (20) and (21). lP is
the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole of mass mP while tP is the evapora-
tion time for such a black hole via the Beckenstein radiation [33]. Interest-
ingly tP is also the Compton time for the Planck mass, a circumstance that is
symptomatic of the fact that at this scale, electromagnetism and gravitation
become of the same order [8]. Indeed all this ﬁts in very well with Rosen’s
analysis that such a Planck scale particle would be a mini universe [25, 34].
We will now re-invoke a time varying gravitational constant

So,

whence on integration we get,

and we can also deduce its spatial counterpart, R = √Nl, which is the well
known empirical Eddington formula.
Equation (22) which is an order of magnitude relation is consistent with ob-
servation as noted [37, 23] while it may be remarked that the Dirac cosmology
itself has inconsistencies.
Substitution of (22) in (20) yields

(21)

(22)

where t as noted is the typical Compton time of an elementary particle. We
can easily verify that (23) is correct. It must be stressed that (23) is not a

fortuitous empirical coincidence, but rather is a result of using (22), which
again as noted, can be deduced from theory.
(23) can be rewritten as

wherein we have used (20) and (22) and n = √N.
We will now compare (24) with the well known relations, referred to earlier,

l = √nlP

t = √ntP

R = √N l T = √Nt

The ﬁrst relation of (25) is the well known Weyl-Eddington formula referred
to while the second relation of (25) is given also on the right side of (22). We
now observe that (25) can be seen to be the result of a Brownian Walk pro-
cess, l, t being typical intervals between ”steps” (Cf.[8, 38, 39]). We demon-
strate this below after equation (27). On the other hand, the typical intervals
l, t can be seen to result from a diﬀusion process themselves. Let us consider
the well known diﬀusion relation,

(∆x)2

l2 =

¯h

t

≡

¯h

∆t

(Cf.[38],[40]-[43]). What is being done here is that we are modeling fuzzy
spacetime by a double Wiener process to be touched upon later, which leads
to (26). This will be seen in more detail, below.
Indeed as l is the Compton wavelength, (26) can be rewritten as the Quantum
Mechanical Uncertainty Principle

at the Compton scale (Cf. also [44]) (or even at the de Broglie scale).
What (26) shows is that a Brownian process deﬁnes the Compton scale while
(25) shows that a Random Walk process with the Compton scale as the
interval deﬁnes the length and time scales of the universe itself (Cf.[39]).
Returning now to (24), on using (21), we observe that in complete analogy
with (26) we have the relation

(∆x)2

l2
P =

≡

¯h
mP

tP ≡

∆t

(27)

9

We can now argue that the Brownian process (27) deﬁnes the Planck length
while a Brownian Random Walk process with the Planck scale as the interval
leads to (24), that is the Compton scale.
To see all this in greater detail, it may be observed that equation (27) (with-
out subscripts)

(∆x)2 =

∆t

¯h
m

is the same as the equation (26), indicative of a double Wiener process.
Indeed as noted by several scholars, this deﬁnes the fractal Quantum path
of dimension 2 (rather than dimension 1) (Cf.e.g. ref.[41]).
Firstly it must be pointed out that equation (28) deﬁnes a minimum space
time unit - the Compton scale (l, t). This follows from (28) if we substitute
∆t imax = c. If the mass of the particle is the Planck mass, then this
into it
Compton scale becomes the Planck scale.
Let us now consider the distance traversed by a particle with the speed of
light through the time interval T . The distance R covered would be

∆x

h

by conventional reasoning. In view of the equation (28), however we would
have to consider ﬁrstly, the minimum time interval t (Compton or Planck
time), so that we have

dx = R = c

dt = cT

Z

Z

dt

nt

→

Z

Secondly, because the square of the space interval ∆x (rather than the inter-
val ∆x itself as in conventional theory) appears in (28), the left side of (29)
becomes, on using (30)

Z
Whence for the linear dimension R we would have

dx2

(√ndx)(√ndy)

→ Z

√nR = nct

or R = √nl

Equation (31) brings out precisely the fractal dimension D = 2 of the Brow-
nian path while (32) is identical to (23) or (25) (depending on whether we
are dealing with minimum intervals of the Planck scale or Compton scale of
elementary particles). Apart from showing the Brownian character linking

10

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

equations (23) and (28), incidentally, this also provides the justiﬁcation for
what has so far been considered to be a mysterious large number coincidence
viz. the Eddington formula (25).
There is another way of looking at this. It is well known that in approaches
like that of the author or Quantum Super String Theory, at the Planck scale
we have a non commutative geometry [45, 46] Indeed as noted, (4) follows
without recourse to Quantum Super Strings, merely by the fact that lP , tP
are the absolute minimum space time intervals as we saw earlier.
The non commutative geometry (4), as is known, is symptomatic of a modi-
ﬁed uncertainty principle at this scale [47]-[52]

∆x

≈

¯h
∆p

+ l2
P

(33)

The relation (33) would be true even in Quantum Gravity. The extra or
second term on the right side of (33) as noted in Chapter 3 expresses the
well known duality eﬀect - as we attempt to go down to the Planck scale,
infact we are lead to the larger scale. The question is, what is this larger
scale? If we now use the fact that √n is the ﬂuctuation in the number of
Planck particles (exactly as √N was the ﬂuctuation in the particle number
as in (22)) so that √nmpc = ∆p is the ﬂuctuation or uncertainty in the
momentum for the second term on the right side of (33), we obtain for the
uncertainty in length,

∆x = l2
P

√nmP c
¯h

= lP √n,

(34)

We can easily see that (34) is the same as the ﬁrst relation of (24). The
second relation of (24) follows from an application of the time analogue of
(33).
Thus the impossibility of going down to the Planck scale because of (4) or
(33), manifests itself in the fact that as we attempt to go down to the Planck
scale, we infact end up at the Compton scale. In the next section we will
give another demonstration of this result. This is how the Compton scale is
encountered in real life.
Interestingly while at the Planck length, we have a life time of the order of
the Planck time, as noted above it is possible to argue on the other hand
that with the mass and length of a typical elementary particle like the pion,
at the Compton scale, we have a life time which is the age of the universe

11

itself as shown by Sivaram [33, 53].
Interestingly also Ng and Van Dam deduce the relations like [54]

δL

≤

(Ll2

P )1/3, δT

(T t2

P )1/3

≤

(35)

where the left side of (35) represents the uncertainty in the measurement of
length and time for an interval L, T . We would like to point out that if in
the above we use for L, T , the size and age of the universe, then ∆L and ∆T
reduce to the Compton scale l, t.
In conclusion, Brownian double Wiener processes and the modiﬁcation of
the Uncertainity Principle at the Planck scale lead to the physical Compton
scale.

4 The Universe as Planck Oscillators

In the previous section, we had argued that a typical elementary particle like
1040 evanescent Planck
a pion could be considered to be the result of n
scale particles. The argument was based on random motions and also on the
modiﬁcation to the Uncertainity Principle. We will now consider the problem
from a diﬀerent point of view, which not only reconﬁrms the above result,
but also enables an elegant extension to the case of the entire universe itself.
Let us consider an array of N particles, spaced a distance ∆x apart, which
behave like oscillators, that is as if they were connected by springs. We then
have [55, 56]

∼

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, r the extent and k

We now identify the particles with Planck masses, set ∆x

Planck length. It may be immediately observed that use of (38) and (37)

mP c2, which ofcourse agrees with the temperature of a black

hole of Planck mass. Indeed, as noted, Rosen had shown that a Planck mass
particle at the Planck scale can be considered to be a universe in itself. We
also use the fact alluded to that a typical elementary particle like the pion can
1040 Planck masses. Using this in (36),
be considered to be the result of n
l, the pion Compton wavelength as required. Further, in this latter
we get r
1040, and (37),i.e. kBT = kl2/N
case, using (48) and the fact that N = n
and (38) and (39), we get for a pion, remembering that m2

∼

∼

P /n = m2,

kBT =

m3c4l2
¯h2 = mc2,

which of course is the well known formula for the Hagedorn temperature for
elementary particles like pions. In other words, this conﬁrms the conclusions
in the previous section, that we can treat an elementary particle as a series
of some 1040 Planck mass oscillators. However it must be observed from
(37) and (38), that while the Planck mass gives the highest energy state, an
elementary particle like the pion is in the lowest energy state. This explains
why we encounter elementary particles, rather than Planck mass particles in
nature. Infact as already noted [8], a Planck mass particle decays via the
10−42secs. On the other hand,
Bekenstein radiation within a Planck time
the lifetime of an elementary particle would be very much higher.
In any case the eﬃcacy of our above oscillator model can be seen by the
fact that we recover correctly the masses and Compton scales in the order of
magnitude sense and also get the correct Bekenstein and Hagedorn formulas
as seen above, and get the correct estimate of the mass of the universe itself,
as will be seen below.
1080 elementary particles
Using the fact that the universe consists of N
like the pions, the question is, can we think of the universe as a collection of
nN or 10120 Planck mass oscillators? This is what we will now show. Infact
if we use equation (36) with

∼

we can see that the extent r

which gives the correct mass M, of the universe which in contrast to the
earlier pion case, is the highest energy state while the Planck oscillators in-
dividually are this time the lowest in this description. In other words the

13

universe itself can be considered to be described in terms of normal modes
of Planck scale oscillators.
The above gives a rationale for the ﬁgure 10120 Planck oscillators which is
derived from the observed 1080 elementary particles in the universe and con-
siderations in Section 2.

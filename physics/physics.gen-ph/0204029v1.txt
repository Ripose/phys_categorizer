An Investigation of Time in Relativity

Abstract

I added an imaginary term by hand to the proper time, ∆T , of special
theory of relativity and wanted to see what will happen to it if I tried to get
the time dilation relationship between ∆T ′ and ∆T . I found that this added
imaginary term of time does not have to be zero.

If ∆T is the real, proper time of travel of a light beam from one point to the other,

∆t = ∆T + i∆ξ

(1)

∆t will be the time I choose and work with in order to see what will happen to
the imaginary part ∆ξ once I apply Einstein’s special relativity.
i∆ξ here is an
imaginary term which I added by hand. Consider two observers O and O′ [1]. O
ﬁres a beam of light at a mirror a distance L away and measures the time interval 2
∆T for the beam to be reﬂected from the mirror and to return to O. Observer O′
is moving at a constant velocity u. As seen from the point of view of O, the beam
is sent and received from the same point, while O′ moves oﬀ in a perpendicular
direction. The beam is sent from some point A and received at some point B a
time 2 ∆T ′ later, according to O′. The distance AB is just 2u∆T ′. According
to O, the light beam travels a distance 2L in a time 2∆T . According to O′, the
light beam travels a distance of 2qL2 + (u∆T ′)2 in a time 2∆T ′. According to
Galilean relativity, ∆T = ∆T ′, and O measures a speed c while O′ measures a speed
√c2 + u2. According to Einstein’s second postulate, this is not possible–both O and
O′ must measure the speed c. Therefore ∆T and ∆T ′ must be diﬀerent. I can ﬁnd
a relationship between ∆T and ∆T ′ by setting the two speeds equal to c. According

to O, c = 2L/2∆T , so L = c∆T . According to O′, c = 2qL2 + (u∆T ′)2/2∆T ′, so
c∆T ′ = qL2 + (u∆T ′)2. Combining these, I ﬁnd

and, solving for ∆T ′,

q1
This relationship summarizes the eﬀect known as time dilation. But in my calcula-
tion, where ∆t = ∆T + i∆ξ, I have according to O,

I can see here in the equation just above that since I added an imaginary part to
time, length in particular or space in general picked up an imaginary part also.
According to O′

Taking the expression of L from equation (4) and inserting it in equation (5) and
squaring, I get

c2(∆T ′ + i∆ξ′)2 = c2(∆T + i∆ξ)2 + u2(∆T ′ + i∆ξ′)2 .

Separating the real terms from the imaginary terms of equation (6) I get

Equation (10) is the product of two terms. Since Einstein’s relativity is considered
to be true, the ﬁrst part vanishes, and leaves us with the condition that ∆ξ can be
diﬀerent from zero. And if ∆ξ is diﬀerent from zero that makes ∆t imaginary since
∆t is equal to ∆T + i∆ξ as indicated in equation (1). I have mathematically found
that relativity allows time to have an imaginary part.

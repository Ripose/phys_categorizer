Direct Test of the Time-Independence of
Fundamental Nuclear Constants Using the Oklo
Natural Reactor ∗

Alexander I. Shlyakhter

November 18, 1982

1 Introduction

The following eight quantities enter the basic laws of physics and are generally
regarded as the “fundamental constants” (I follow Dyson’s review [1] in this
section).

1. c = 3 · 1010cm · sec−1, velocity of light

2. ~ = 1.05 · 10−27erg · sec, Planck’s constant

3. e = 4.8 · 10−10erg1/2cm1/2, elementary charge
4. mp = 1.6 · 10−24gram, mass of the proton
5. g = 1.4 · 10−49erg · cm3, Fermi’s constant of weak interactions

6. G = 6.7 · 10−8erg · cm · gram−2, constant of gravitation

7. H = 1.6 · 10−18sec−1, Hubble’s constant (1/H ≈ 2 · 1010 years gives the

“age” of the Universe)

8. ρ = 10−31gram · cm−3, mean density of mass in the Universe

This list is not exhaustive, of course. In particular, the constants of strong

interactions could be added to it.

The “cosmological” quantities H and ρ, which refer to the Universe as a
whole, vary as it expands: they are decreasing at the rate of about 5·10−11yr−1.
On the other hand, the “laboratory” quantities 1)-6) are generally believed to
be exactly constant. Milne [2] and Dirac [3] were the ﬁrst to notice that this is
no more than a hypothesis, requiring experimental conﬁrmation.

I’d like to emphasize that only those variations of fundamental constants
which change at least one dimensionless ratio of the dimensional quantities
have physical meaning. The reason is that only such ratios do not depend on
the choice of units and standards.

From the dimensional quantities 1) - 8) ﬁve dimensionless ratios can be

formed:

1. α = e2/~c ≈ 1/137

2. β = (gm2

pc)/~3 = 9 · 10−6
p)/(~c) = 5 · 10−39

3. γ = (Gm2
4. δ = (H~)/(mpc2) = 10−42
5. ǫ = (Gρ)/H 2 = 2 · 10−3

Note that the inverse of δ gives δ−1 = 1042 which is the age of the Universe

measured in “tempons” (atomic units of time).

According to the conventional view the ratios of the “laboratory” quantities
α, β, and γ did not change their numerical values during the 20 billion years
since the “Big Bang”.

The Conventional View: α, β, γ = const; β ∼ t−1, γ ∼ t−1.
Dirac [3] introduced the “Numerological Principle” (or “The Large Numbers
Hypothesis” (LNH) which states that “all very large dimensionless numbers
which can be constructed from the important natural constants of cosmology
and atomic theory are connected by simple mathematical relations involving
coeﬃcients of the order of magnitude unity” [3b]. For example, the large value
of γ−1 could prove compatible with the numerological principle if it was pro-
portional to δ−1 and thus was time-dependent.

The majority of the proposed versions of the possible variation of constants
is based on similar arguments. Three of them are listed below (see [1, 3, 4, 5]).

• Dirac (1937): α, β, ǫ = const; γ ∼ t−1, δ ∼ t−1

• Teller (1948): β, ǫ = const, α−1 ∼ ln(γ−1), γ ∼ t−1, δ ∼ t−1

• Gamow (1967): β, γ, ǫ = const, α ∼ t, δ ∼ t−1

These versions predict the rate of variation of constants at the present epoch

about 10−10 − 10−12yr−1.

2 Experimental Limits on the Rate of Variation

of “Nuclear” Constants

(The limits of the possible change of the constant of gravitation are discussed
in [1, 6, 7, 25]).

2

Direct experimental evidence comes either from astrophysics or from geo-
physics. Astrophysical data allow judgement on the large-scale uniformity of
physical laws in space (at distances up to 15 billion light years). Geophysi-
cal ones provide evidence on the absence of variation of constants along the
world-line of the Earth since its crust became solid (≈ 4.5 billion years ago).

The data on the absorption spectra of the distant quasars show that the
numerical value of the dimensionless quantity |α2 · gp · me/mp| is the same
throughout the observable Universe with the accuracy of about 10−4 [8]. If one
assumes the Friedman model, this limit restricts the possible rate of variation
of α by ≈ 10−14yr−1.

The decay rate λ of radioactive nuclide depends on nuclear constants. For
example, in the case of high Z and small decay energy δ the β-decay rate λβ is
highly sensitive to the value of α. The estimate of the “sensitivity” s gives [1]

For the transition 187

76 Os (T1/2 ≈ 40 billion years, ∆ = 2.5 keV),
this estimate gives s = −2 · 104. Using the data on the abundances of rhenium
and osmium isotopes, Dyson [1] obtained the following upper limit on the rates
of variation of α and β:

3 Neutron Resonances as the Sensitive Indica-
tors of the Variation of Nuclear Constants

Several years ago I noticed that because of the sharp resonances in its absorp-
tion cross-section, the heavy nucleus is a highly tuned detector of neutrons.
Resonances will shift along the energy scale if there is a change in the nuclear
potential, by analogy with the shift in the reception frequency in an ordinary
radio receiver when there is a change in the parameters of the resonance circuit
[9].

For the incident neutron, the nucleus presents a potential well with the
depth of about V0 = 50 MeV. At low neutron energy the cross-section exhibits
sharp resonances (Fig. 1). Their positions are measured with the accuracy
∆exp ∼ 10−2 eV. Thus, there are two energy scales: V0 and ∆exp. Any change
of V0 by ∆V0 would cause the shift of all nuclear levels including the levels of
compound nucleus, i.e. neutron resonances (Fig. 2).

3

The dimensionless quantity entering this problem is the ratio of the depth
of the potential well V0 to the uncertainty in the resonance energy ∆exp. This
suggests that variations of the basic nuclear parameters are ampliﬁed in the
shift of resonances by an enormous factor s ∼ 1010.

Unfortunately, it seems very diﬃcult to calculate consistently the shift of
a given neutron resonance caused by the variation of the fundamental nuclear
constants. Here I shall use the simplest assumption that neutron resonances are
shifted by ∆V0 like single-particle levels in a potential well. Then the experi-
mental evidence showing that the shift of the resonances during the time period
T has not exceeded ∆exp imposes the following limits on the possible variation
of the interaction constants:

• strong: | ˙V0/V0| ≤ ∆exp/(V0 · T ) = 2 · 10−8 · ∆exp(eV )/T (yrs)

• electromagnetic: | ˙α/α| ∼ 20| ˙V0/V0|
• weak: | ˙β/β| ∼ 5 · 106| ˙V0/V0|

I follow Gamow [5b] in assuming that the variation of the strong interaction
constants is adequately reproduced by the change in the depth of the nuclear
potential well. The estimate for | ˙α/α| is based on the equation of nuclear
compressibility [10]. For nuclei with A ∼ 150 the change in the radius appears
to be 40 times less than the change in α and the corresponding shift of the levels
is 20 times less. The limit for | ˙β/β| is obtained assuming that the contribution
of weak interactions to the nuclear binding energy is of the order of 2 · 10−7
[11, 12].

These estimates demonstrate that if there existed a Precambrian physicist
who could measure the energies of the neutron resonances about a billion years
ago with an accuracy about 10−2 eV then the limits of the possible variation
of the fundamental nuclear constants could be improved by several orders of
magnitude. The striking discovery of the “Oklo natural nuclear reactor” proves
that such seemingly improbable experiment has been actually performed nearly
2 billion years ago and the results have been reliably “recorded” in the isotopic
composition of the elements in the reactor core.

4 The Oklo Phenomenon

Oklo is the name of a locality in the Gabon Republic (West Africa) where the
open-pit uranium mine is situated. About 1.8 billion years ago within a rich
vein of uranium ore “the natural reactor” went critical, consumed a portion
of its fuel and then shut down. The total amount of energy produced by the
reactor is estimated as 1.5 · 104 megawatt years which seems to be enough for a
city like Budapest for about a year. You now may have a question: how could it
appear that even in the design of nuclear reactors, which is generally considered
to be one of the most impressive achievements of science and technology of our
century, “the man was not an innovator but an unwitting imitator of nature”
[17].

4

In fact, no natural reactor could operate today with uranium containing only
0.72 percent of the ﬁssile isotope 235U. The ratio of 235U to 238U, however, has
not been constant throughout the history of the Earth. The half-life of 235U is
about 700 million years, that of 238U about 4.6 billion years. Thus, 2 billion
years ago the abundance of 235U was about 3 percent (note that in the contem-
porary power-producing reactors uranium is enriched up to the same value). In
1956 Kuroda [13] showed that at that epoch under favourable conditions (i.e.
concentration of water must be high enough and that of the strong absorbers of
neutrons low enough) the spontaneous nuclear chain reaction could take place
in rich uranium deposits. However, until 1972 no traces of a natural reactor
have been found.

In June 1972 the uranium slightly depleted in 235U was ﬁrst detected at a
French uranium-enrichment plant. The anomaly was traced through the numer-
ous stages of the manufacturing process right back to the ore-enriching plant at
Mounana near Franceville in Gabon. The original ore with mean 235U abun-
dance of 0.4-0.5% was mined at Oklo. The French Atomic Energy Comission
(CEA) then initiated the investigation of this “Oklo Phenomenon”. The anal-
ysis of the numerous samples obtained by drilling revealed the distribution of
isotopic anomalies in detail. The results were discussed at the IAEA sympo-
siums [14, 15] and reviewed in [16, 17, 18, 19].

Altogether 6 reaction zones (Fig. 3) were found over a distance of a few
dozen meters. The spectrum of ﬁssion products (especially of the rare-earths)
gives the quantitative evidence that a natural reactor once operated there. Both
the absolute amounts of these elements and their isotopic composition can be
explained only by their origin in ﬁssion (Table 7). The ﬂuence (the ﬂux inte-
grated over time) of thermal neutrons, which can be determined e.g. from the
144Nd/143Nd ratio, reaches the value of 1.5 · 1021n/cm2 (Fig. 4). This means
that the strong absorbers of thermal neutrons (having capture cross sections
σγ & 2 · 103 barn) must become heavily depleted. At the same time the con-
centration of the next (in A) isotope will increase. This phenomenon has been
observed experimentally (Fig. 5). This in itself shows immediately that a chain
reaction initiated by thermal neutrons has taken place.

5 The “Measurement” of the Energies of Neu-
tron Resonances 2 Billion Years Ago Using
the Oklo Data

In the strong absorbers of thermal neutrons their large capture cross sections are
determined in each case by a single resonance which is occasionally located near
zero neutron energy. The cross section is given by the Breit-Wigner formula

Here g is the statistical factor, E is the neutron energy and λ is the cor-

responding wavelength, Γn and Γγ are the partial elastic and capture widths,
and Γ is the total width of the resonance. The cross section changes sharply
when the resonance is shifted along the energy scale. Fig. 6 shows this eﬀect
for the maxwellian-averaged (at kT=0.025 eV) capture cross section of 149Sm.
From the relative concentrations of samarium isotopes and the neutron ﬂuence
independently determined at the same points of the reactor one can extract the
value of the capture cross section at the epoch of chain reaction. For exam-
ple, R. Naudet et al [14] have measured the isotopic composition of uranium,
neodymium and samarium in 50 samples and have managed to determine the
ﬂuence ψ from U and Nd data reliably for 36 of them. Then the cross section
of 149Sm is given by the following equation

N147 + N148
N149

·

¯N235

· σ149

Here Ni denotes the ﬁnal concentrations of samarium isotopes, ¯N235/N235
is the ratio of the average 235U concentration during the period of the reaction
to its ﬁnal value, γi are the yields of 147,149Sm from the ﬁssion of 235U (γ148 is
negligible).

The analysis of samarium data for the same 36 samples where ψ is known

gives the value of σOklo

149 “measured” 2 billion years ago

σOklo
149 = (55 ± 8) · 10

the contemporary value being ≈ 60 · 103 barn (this value depends on the
spectrum of thermal neutrons, here I use the maxwellian spectrum at T =
300◦K). Taking into account two standard erros, we obtain [9a]

If one takes into account also the data for europium (which are less precise)

with three standard errors the result is [9b]

|∆exp| ≤ 20 · 10

−3eV

|∆exp| ≤ 50 · 10

−3eV

Note that the eﬀect of such a small shift of resonances upon the capture cross
sections of uranium and neodimium is negligible, so the ﬂuence ψ is determined
reliably.

Yu.V.Petrov [18] has pointed out that one could avoid determining ψ if the
relative concentrations of two strong absorbers were available. In this case the
absence of a shift in the resonance of one absorber relative to the other can be
veriﬁed directly.

The absence of an appreciable shift of near-threshold resonances also follows
qualitatively from the fact that all the contemporary strong absorbers were
strongly burnt up in the Oklo reactor, whereas the weak absorbers were weakly
burnt up [18].
In addition to the cadmium data (Fig. 5) the results of the
measurements of the conentration of rare-earth elements relative to 143Nd in one
of the Oklo samples [20] are reproduced in Fig. 7. The dips in the distribution

6

correspond to strong absorbers: 149Sm, 151Eu, 155Gd and 157Gd. The burn-up
depth, calculated using the contemporary values of absorption cross section is
in excellent agreement with experiment, especially if we recall that the neutron
spectrum over which the cross section has to be averaged is now known well
enough.

We therefore conclude once again that, over the 1.8 billion years since the
operation of the Oklo reactor, the resonances or, in other words, the compound-
nucleus levels, have shifted by less than Γ/2 ∼ 50 · 10−3 eV, i.e. the mean rate
of the shift did not exceed 3 · 10−11 eV / year. This is by three orders of mag-
nitude less than the experimental limit on the rate of change in the transition
energy in the decay of 187Re. Unfortunately, at present there are no consistent
calculations that would have connected the position of each neutron resonance
with the nuclear potential parameters reliably. However, even the preliminary
estimates of Sec. 3 can be used to improve the limits obtained by other authors
substantially (Table 7). These estimates evidently rule out a power law or a log-
arithmic asymptotic dependence of the strong and electromagnetic interaction
constants on the lifetime of the Universe.

6 The Probability of an Occasional Coincidence

I have assumed above that the variation of nuclear constants (if any) has been
very small so that the shift of resonances would have appeared much less than
their average separation. One could imagine, however, a case in which even
after a considerable variation of the constants all the strong absorbers would
have remained strong. This could occur if some other resonance appeared near
the threshold and dominated in the capture cross section.
In this section I
shall estimate the probability of such a coincidence using the recently developed
statistical approach to estimating unknown thermal cross sections [21].

For each nuclide one calculates the “expected” capture cross section σ∗
γ using
the average values of its resonance parameters. The universal distribution func-
tion Sγ(z) has been calculated using the generally accepted distribution laws
for these parameters. It gives the probability for the ratio of the actual cross
section σγ to its expected value σγ/σ∗

γ not to exceed z.

Table 7 which is taken from [23] gives the probability for each strong absorber
to remain strong after a large variation of constants. I assumed that its new
cross section will be at least half of its old value. Those nuclides for which
this probability is small appear to be sensitive “indicators” of the variation of
constants (e.g. 113Cd and 157Gd). On the other hand, 151Eu will remain a
strong absorber with the probability of about 0.3, thus being rather useless in
this respect. The product of the values 1 − Sγ(z) for all nuclides gives the
probability of a simultaneous coincidence the estimate P ∼ 4 · 10−7. Note
that this estimate is rather conservative since if the resonances have shifted
considerably some weak absorbers could have been strong ones 2 billion years
ago, giving rise to some mysterious isotopic anomalies at Oklo none of which
have been seen.

7

7 Conclusions

The analysis of the Oklo data provides very strong evidence in favour of the
invariability of nuclear constants. The shift of neutron resonances during the
last 2 billion years does not exceed 50 · 10−3eV or 3 · 10−11eV /yr. This is
so far the most precise limit and simple estimates of the rate of variation of
the interaction constants shown in Table 7 were cited on several occasions (see
e.g.
[24, 25, 26, 27]). I must note, however, that these estimates should not
be taken too seriously. More accurate theoretical calculations of the inﬂuence
of the fundamental constants on the parameters of the neutron resonances are
required.

On the other hand, Oklo is the only place on Earth where the variability of
nuclear constants (if any) could be detected. For this reason it would be very
interesting to cary out special measurements in order to improve the limit ∆exp.
However, at present all the available data support the conventional view, ac-
cording to which the values of constants have not changed since the “Big Bang”.
How could then the “Large Numbers” coincidences be explained? Zel’dovich
[28] has noted that within modern quantum ﬁeld theory, spontaneous topology
change can readily give rise to large numbers which are comparable to those
considered by Dirac. An alternative answer is suggested by the so-called “an-
thropic principle” [29, 30, 31] which states that only those universes can ever
become observable where the “observers” can survive. The very possibility of
life appears remarkably sensitive to the numerical values of physical constants.
Following this line of argument all “Large Numbers” can be derived without
any appeal to the variation of constants.

It was a great honor for me to win the international competition of young
scientists in 1979 and to be invited to ATOMKI. I would like to express here
my deep gratitude to V.A.Nazarenko and Yu.V.Petrov for their interest and
support.

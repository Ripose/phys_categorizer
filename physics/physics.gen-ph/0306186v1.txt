It is commonly believed that (α-d) and (3He - 3H) represent equivalent
states of 6Li. It is shown here that this is not correct. These two are actually
orthogonal to each other. It is shown here that these two with very diﬀerent
shapes and forms actually co-exist for the ground state of 6Li. This shape
co-existence is the same as similar phenomenon in heavy nuclei. The puz-
zling anomaly of extremely small branching ratio for beta delayed deuteron
emission in 6He is explained here. In addition the anomalously large branch-
ing ratio for beta delayed triton emission in 8He is explained. The cluster
structure of the ground state and of the low-lying states of 6He, 6Li and 6Be
is clariﬁed.

Abstract

Cluster structure forms an important aspect of modern nuclear studies
[1,2].
In addition, unexpected halo structure has been found to exist in
neutron-rich light nuclei [3,4]. Here we wish to study A=6 nuclei: 6He, 6Li
and 6Be. The aim is to study as to what kind of clusters are relevant here
and how these aﬀect the structure of these nuclei in the ground state and in
the excited states. Recent publication [5] of the energy levels of these nuclei
shall be found to be handy for our studies here.

It has been discussed extensively how 6He is a two-neutron halo nucleus.
In this case two neutrons are found to be very loosely bound around an inert
α-particle [3]. This has been well studied and therefore one can safely say
that the predominant structure of the ground state of 6He is (α-n-n). The
other possibility of (t-t) cluster structure does not seem to have a role in the
ground state of 6He, but should have a role specially for the excited states
above the (t-t) breakup threshold. But why (h-h) cluster structure does not
mix with (α-n-n) structure for the ground state of 6He is not understood
so far. Below we shall give an explanation of this eﬀect (and also for the
corresponding situation in 6Be). 6Be being mirror partner of 6He would be
expected to have similar structure - ie. predominant (α-p-p) for the ground
state. This similarity seems to hold well. But the same cannot be said for
the isospin partner 6Li.

It is generally believed that for the ground state and the low excited
states of 6Li (α-n-p) (or (α-d)) conﬁguration is much more important than
(h-t) (note: h=3He) [eg. 6 (p.115), 7 (p.104)]. Most of the studies recently
follow this line of (α-n-p) being signiﬁcant for the ground state and the low-
lying excitations [8,9]. Meanwhile there have been compelling experimental
evidences which indicate that the (h-t) conﬁguration for 6Li cannot be ig-
nored, and may be quite important [10-12]. It turns out that the two cluster
conﬁgurations (α-d) and (h-t) are not mutually exclusive and that they can
both be present as they are not orthogonal either [6,13]. A few recent the-
oretical studies also support this view [14]. Recent experimental study of
tri-nucleon cluster knockout for 6Li favours simultaneously existing (α-d)
and (h-t) structures [15]. Most of the scientists are by and large reconciled
to the situation as depicted in the following quotation from ref. 15 : ”Since
the alpha particle is a very tight system, one would expect 6Li to be most of
the time in an (α-d) conﬁguration (even though the (3H - 3He) conﬁguration
occurs some of the time)”. The vagueness conveyed by this statement can be
traced to the fact that (α-d) and (h-t) conﬁguration of 6Li are not orthog-

2

onal and it is hard to give physical interpretation to the relative weights of
these conﬁgurations [6,p.43]. Let us look into this equivalence, simultaneous
existence and non-orthogonality of (α-d) and (h-t) cluster structures of 6Li.
Before we do this, let us point out one further information on 6Li, which
is anathema for all other models. This is the study of beta-delayed deuteron
emission in 6He and beta-delayed triton emission in 8He [16, 17]. The most
established beta decay of 6He is to the 1+ ground state of 6Li. They ﬁnd
[16,17] evidence of a second beta decay branch leading to unbound ﬁnal
state consisting of a deuteron and an alpha particle. They ﬁnd ”...
the
astonishingly small branching ratio for deuteron in 6He and the surprisingly
large one for tritons in 8He ” [17]. This one order to two order suppression
cannot be understood on the basis of any models of 6Li. In this letter we
give an explanation of this anomaly in terms of the model that we shall
develop here. This model will enable us to have a better and more consistent
understanding of these three A=6 nuclei. In addition the anomanously large
triton branch case for 6He will also thus be naturally explained.

In oscillator model the ground state of 6Li is described by the following

wave functions of equivalent forms [6,p.40, appendix C]

ψgs(6Li) = A{φ0(α)φ0(d)χ(α − d)} = NA(φ0(t)φ0(h)χ(t − h)}

(1)

Here χ(α − d) and χ(t − h) are two oscillator quanta wave functions
and φ0(α), φ0(d), φ0(t), φ0(h) are the internal wave functions. The constant
N is here to ensure that the two functions are equal to each other. The
mathematical equivalence of the two can be easily demonstrated. Since they
are the same, these can exist simultaneously and also note that these are
not orthogonal [6]. None of this is changed even with the hard core of the
Jastrow form in the two body interaction [6, p.113]. This is the broad view
which has been dominating the 6Li studies so far [11-15].

However, in the above mathematical proof, there is an underlying ansatz -
which is that in the Schroedinger equation one need go only up to two-body
interactions and ignore all many body forces like the Three Body Forces
(3BF) V ijk [6, p.1]. This was perhaps acceptable in the 60’s but today we
know that for A=3 nuclei ’h’ and ’t’ there is no way we can obtain the binding
energies and the rms radii for these nuclei without invoking some form of a
simple or a more complicated 3BF [eg. references in 18,19] in addition to the

3

usual two body interactions. In addition in A=4 nuclei Four Body Forces (
4BF ) may be active too. Once the 3BF ( and 4BF ) are included, clearly
the equivalence (and simultaneous existence) of (α-d) and (h-t) clusters for
6Li is lost. Hence all the physics which has been obtained with this idea [6,
11-15, etc] cannot be accepted any more.

Having disposed of the equivalence and simultaneous existence of (α-d)
and (h-t) clusters for 6Li, could it be that they are still not orthogonal? In
this connection it may be pointed out that while discussing the coupled chan-
nel equations for nuclear reactions and nuclear bound states, Wildermuth and
McClure [6,p.88] do require that these two conﬁgurations be ”asymptotically
orthogonal”.

To discuss this non-orthogonality further we have to understand some of
the present author’s recent work on halo nuclei [20]. Basing arguments on
QCD and quark model [21,22] one is able to explain the existence of hole
in central charge density distribution of A=3 and A=4 nuclei, the existence
of haloes in neutron-rich nuclei, the occurrence of nuclear molecules and the
onset of clustering in nuclei [20]. Interestingly, it is QCD and quark-based
considerations which are able to explain these low-energy and ground-state
properties of nuclei.

The central empirical fact (which arises from QCD and quark model basis)
is the unique charge and matter distribution of A=3 and A=4 nuclei. That
is the ”hole” in these nuclei [21,22]. It is well known that in the nuclei ’h’, ’t’
and α the central densities are larger than any other nuclei. In addition, the
fact that there is a hole at the centre actually pushes the densities outwards
and making them peak further out in these nuclei. This is a unique property
of these nuclei [20-22]. In addition, deuteron is very large and diﬀuse. Thus,
(α-d) and (h-t) conﬁgurations would appear very diﬀerent physically.
It
would not be trivial to change from one density distribution to another.
This will be resisted by the basic diﬀerence in the two conﬁgurations. Hence
it is on this physical ground that these two clusters : (α-d) and (h-t) should
be orthogonal to each other.

Note that ’n’ and ’p’ are members of an isospin doublet. These combine
together to give a bound triplet state (S=1, T=0), that is deuteron with a
binding energy of 2.2 MeV. It has no excited states. The singlet state (S=0,
T=1) is unbound by 64 keV. This being isospin partner of (n-n) (S=0, T=1)
and (p-p) (S=0,T=1), all these are unbound. Now it turns out that ’h’ and
’t’ are also members of a good isospin 1/2. Note that though both ’n’ and ’p’

4

are composites of three quarks these still act as elementary particles as far as
low-energy excitations of nuclear physics are concerned. Only at relatively
higher energies does the compositeness of ’n’ and ’p’ manifest itself. Similarly
the binding energies of 3He and 3H are 7.72 MeV and 8.48 MeV respectively
and also these two have no excited states. Hence for low-energy excitations,
of a few MeV, we may consider these as elementary. Their compositeness
would be manifested at higher excitation energies. That is we treat ’h’ and
’t’ as elementary isospin 1/2 entities here. This is similar to the two nucleon
case. Hence, we would expect for (h-t) the triplet (S=1,T=0) to be bound
and singlet (S=0,T=1) to be unbound. Also, its isospin partners (h-h) (S=0,
T=1) and (t-t) (S=0, T=1) would be unbound too.

This means that (h-h) (S=0, T=1) being unbound would not mix with
the bound (α-n-n) conﬁguration of 6He for the ground state. Similarly, the
(t-t) (S=0, T=1) being unbound would not mix with the bound (α-p-p)
ground state conﬁguration of 6Be. Therefore, 6He and 6Be in its ground
state and low excited states remain pure (α-N-N) conﬁguration. This is the
conﬁguration that others have been discussing and using for these nuclei
anyway [8,9]. However, things are diﬀerent for 6Li.

Here in 6Li the (h-t) (S=1, T=0) conﬁguration is bound with no other
excited state. Being bound, it is close to the bound ground state of the or-
thogonal conﬁguration (α-d). Thus for the ground state of 6Li the two states
(h-t) (S=1, T=0) and (α-d) (S=1,T=0) which though orthogonal actually
co-exist. These being of such diﬀerent physical shapes ( as we discussed be-
fore ) thus this should actually be viewed as co-existence of diﬀerent shapes.
This situation is similar to the co-existence of diﬀerent shapes - spherical and
deformed, etc. as is well known in the case of heavy nuclei. Note that here
we are ﬁnding co-existence of two diﬀerent shapes in a very light nucleus.

Thus we expect that for the ground state of 6Li (S=1, T=0), these two
diﬀerent cluster structures (α-d) and (h-t) would mix and repel. Thus, for
the ground state wave function would be

ψ(6Li)) = aψ(α − p − n) + bψ(h − t)

(2)
with a2 + b2 = 1. The amplitude ’a’ and ’b’ would be found from best
ﬁts to suitable experiments. As per various studies [8,9], one would expect
’a’ to be more dominant for the ground state, but that ’b’ is not negligible
[12,14] and actually should be quite signiﬁcant [10,11,15].

5

If this be so, there should exist another higher-lying (S=1,T=0) orthog-

onal state in 6Li with wave function

ψ∗(6Li)) = bψ(α − p − n) − aψ(h − t)

(3)
with ’a’,’b’ the same as in ψ(6Li). Indeed, this state exists as the 5.65
MeV excited state in 6Li [5] and we identify ψ∗(6Li) with this. So both
the ground state and the 5.65 MeV states are mixed states of these two
orthogonal cluster structures. Hence, rest of the low-lying states in 6Li (as
in 6He and 6Be) should be of simple (α-N-N) structure.

Note that for ψ(α-p-n) amplitude ’a’ is much larger than the ψ (h-t)
amplitude for the ground state and thus the ψ(α-p-n) or ψ(α-d) conﬁguration
would be much smaller than the corresponding ψ (h-t) amplitude for the 5.65
MeV (1+,0) state. This will help us to explain the beta-delayed deuteron
emission puzzle referred to earlier [16,17].

The normal beta decay of 6He proceeds almost entirely to the 1+ ground
state of 6Li which as discussed is mainly of (α-d) conﬁguration. The other
beta-delayed deuteron emission in our picture goes almost entirely to the 5.65
MeV 1+ state in 6Li. Therefore in our model the weakness in the intensity of
the branch is mainly due to the small fraction of (α-d) existing in that state.
The authors of ref. [16] had tried to bring in this 1+ excited state at 5.65
MeV, but failed to reach the right conclusion mainly because ﬁrstly they
also tried to simultaneously include the ground state in their analysis, and
secondly as they believed that the 5.65 MeV is mainly made up of (α-d)
conﬁguration in the d-wave. The right answer is that this second branch
proceeds only to the 5.65 MeV state which is mainly of (h-t) conﬁguration
as shown above.

In trying to understand the surprisingly large branching ratio for beta-
delayed triton emission in 8He, the authors of ref. [17] suggeted the existence
of a new 1+ state at 9.3 MeV in 8Li. They did not know the origin of this
state though. Quite clearly in our model here this is the state built up on
the 1+ state at 5.65 MeV in 6Li. Thus this excited 1+ state in 8Li has two
components which both have quantum numbers of the cluster structure (α-
t-n). Therefore tritons would be easily emitted in this branch of beta decay
in 8He. Thus this puzzle ﬁnds natural explanation in our model.

Another confusing situation which ﬁnds simple clariﬁcation in our model
is that of (6Li,d) and (7Li,t) reactions. On the basis of the misconception that

6

only (α-d) and (α-t) give the cluster structures of 6Li and 7Li respectively,
it is commonly suggested that the the above two reactions should proceed
through the α-particle stripping, similar to the (d-p) reaction. But careful
calculations by various groups have shown that this is more complicated than
the simple neutron stripping case. Hence these two reactions are much more
than a single α stripping. In our model this is simply understood as arising
from the two components of the ground state wave function of 6Li and 7Li.
In summary, it is shown here that contrary to all earlier expectations, the
(h-t) and (α-d) structures are orthogonal to each other in 6Li. Therefore,
for the ground state of 6Li, these two diﬀerent shapes co-exist. We have
shown that, for 6He and 6Be the conﬁguration for the ground state and low
excitations is mainly (α-N-N). In 6Li it is (α-N-N) for all low-lying states
except the ground state and the 5.65 MeV state ( both 1+,0) which are
mixed states of the orthogonal clusters (α-d) and (h-t). Thus, in this model
one is able to explain the puzzling extremely small branching ratio of beta-
delayed deuteron emission in 6He. Simple extrapolation of these states to
8Li explains the equally puzzling large branching ratio of beta-delated triton
emission in 8He.

Abstract

Observations of the apparent times and positions of moving clocks as predicted
by both ‘non-local’ and ‘local’ Lorentz Transformations are considered. Only lo-
cal transformations respect translational invariance. Such transformations change
temporal but not spatial intervals, so breaking space time exchange symmetry and
forbidding relativity of simultaneity and length contraction. A satellite cesium clock
experiment to test these predictions is proposed.

Introduction

The relativistic Length Contraction (LC)1 and Time Dilatation (TD) eﬀects were
pointed out as consequences of the space-time Lorentz Transformation (LT) in Einstein’s
original paper [1] on Special Relativity (SR). The LC eﬀect was clearly stated to be an
‘apparent’ one in Reference [1]; even so, in many text books on SR it is stated to be not
only an, in principle, experimentally observable eﬀect but also a ‘real’ one implying that
there is actually some dynamical contraction of the body, as discussed for example, in
References [2, 3].

It was only on making a more careful analysis of the physics of the observation process
that it was realised, some ﬁve decades after Einstein’s original paper, that the length
contracted sphere that he considered would appear to be, to a distant observer, not
ﬂattened into an ellipsoid, but simply rotated [4, 5]. This is because ‘observation’ actually
means the detection of photons emitted by, or scattered from, the observed object. Not
only the LC eﬀect but also the the eﬀects of light propagation time delays of the observed
photons and optical aberration (that is, the change in the direction of motion of a photon
due to the LT of its momentum) must also be properly accounted for. In the present
paper it is assumed throughout that all observations are corrected for the last two eﬀects,
so that the apparent positions are predicted by the LT only.

In a recent paper by the present author [6] is was noticed that the LC eﬀect itself is
closely akin to the eﬀect of light propagation time delays. In the latter, in order to arrive
at the observer at the same time (this is the deﬁnition of the observation that gives LC)
the photons coming from parts of the viewed object at diﬀerent distances along the line
of sight must be emitted from the object at diﬀerent times. Similarly, because of the
‘relativity of simultaneity’ proposed by Einstein, the photons recorded by the observer at
a ﬁxed time must be emitted, from the moving object, at diﬀerent positions along the
direction of motion of the object. Thus LC is a strict consequence of the relativity of
simultaneity. In the same paper [6] two other apparent distortions of space-time due to
the LT: Space Dilatation (SD) in which the moving object appears longer (not shorter as
in LC) and Time Contraction (TC) in which which the moving equivalent clock viewed
at a ﬁxed position in the observer’s frame appears to be running faster (not slower as in
TD) than an identical stationary clock, were pointed out. The four eﬀects LC, TD, SD
and TC are all related to the projective geometry of the LT equations, and correspond to
the projections with ∆t = 0, ∆x′ = 0, ∆t′ = 0 and ∆x = 0 respectively 2. The ‘apparent’
nature of all the eﬀects is then manifest since a moving object cannot be ‘really’ contracted
in, for example, the LC eﬀect, if, with a diﬀerent observation procedure (SD) it appears
to be elongated. A similar consideration applies to the (opposite) TD and TC eﬀects.

objects (i.e.

In an even more recent paper [7] the relation between the ‘real’ positions of moving
those deﬁned, for diﬀerent objects in a common reference frame) to the
1In References [6, 7], by the present author, the acronym ‘LFC’ for ‘Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction’was
used. But as this name is more properly assigned to a conjectured dynamical eﬀect in a pre-relativistic
theory (see Section 7 below), ‘LC’ for Length Contraction or Lorentz Contraction (a consequence of the
Lorentz Transformation) is used throughout the present paper.

apparent positions predicted by the LT was considered in detail. In particular, the well
known ‘Rockets-and-String’ [8] and ‘Pole-and-Barn’ [9] paradoxes were re-discussed and
a procedure for measuring the real positions of moving objects in a single reference frame
was proposed.

The present paper pursues further the relation between the real and apparent positions
of moving objects as well as analysing the times registered by two, spatially separated,
synchronised, moving clocks viewed by a stationary observer. It is noted that, due to the
ambiguity in the choice of the origin of spatial coordinates in the rest frame of the moving
objects or clocks, no deﬁnite predictions are obtained for either the times recorded by, or
the apparent positions of, the moving clocks, but that, in every case, there is a violation
of translational invariance. Only if a local LT is used, in which the origin of spatial
coordinates in the rest frame of the moving object coincides with the spatial coordinate
of the transformed event, is translational invariance found to be respected. In this case
there is no ‘relativity of simultaneity’ and the related LC, TC and SD eﬀects do not
occur. However, TD, that results from a local LT, is unaﬀected by the restriction to
this type of transformation. It is shown in Section 8 below that, in fact, TD is the only
relativistic space-time eﬀect that is conﬁrmed experimentally. Only time intervals, not
space intervals, are modiﬁed by a local LT, thus breaking, in this case the space-time
exchange symmetry recently proposed as a mathematical basis for SR [10].

The plan of this paper is as follows: In the following Section, translational invariance
is discussed in a general way in connection with the observation of two identical and
similarly accelerated clocks. In Section 3 the observation of the times of clocks subjected
to a similar, constant, acceleration in their proper frames is discussed for local and non-
local LTs. In Section 4 the real and apparent positions of the moving clocks are discussed
in relation to the LC eﬀect.
In Section 5, the principle of ‘Source Signal Contiguity’
is proposed and some causal paradoxes of SR are resolved by use of the local LT. In
Section 6 the breakdown of space-time exchange symmetry by a local LT is described and
relativistic kinematics is discussed. Section 7 contains an analysis of the Michelson Morley
experiment considered as a ‘photon clock’. A concise review of the experimental tests of
SR performed to date is presented in Section 8. In Section 9 an extension of a previously
performed satellite experiment is proposed to measure the TC eﬀect and therefore test,
for the ﬁrst time, relativity of simultaneity.

2 Moving Clocks and Translational Invariance

In the following, in order to investigate the properties of the space-time LT, it will
be found convenient to consider two identical clocks, A and B, which perform identical
motion parallel to the x-axis of a ‘stationary’ inertial frame S. The common co-moving
frame, at any instant, of A and B, is denoted by S’. Initially, A and B, which have each
been synchronised with a reference clock, C, at rest in the frame S, are at rest in S,
separated by a distance, L (see Fig.1a). At time t = 0 each clock is subjected to an
identical acceleration program during the time tacc in S. Because the velocities of A and B
are the same at any instant, a common co-moving inertial frame always exists for the two
clocks. Their separation, as measured in this co-moving frame, or in the frame S, remains

2

Figure 1: a) clocks A, B and C at t = t′ = 0. They are at rest in S. b) After an identical
acceleration program, during time tacc in S, the clocks A and B (at rest in S’) move in
S with velocity vf parallel to the x-axis. Due to relativistic eﬀects, t′ < tacc, but, from
translational invariance, t′A = t′B.

L at all times3. Because of relativistic eﬀects, that will be calculated in the following
Section for a speciﬁc acceleration program, the observed time in S, t′, registered by the
moving clocks A and B will diﬀer from that shown by the reference clock C that is at rest
in S. However, the times indicated by A and B must be identical. This is a consequence
of translational invariance. The relativistic eﬀects of the acceleration program must be
the same whether they are applied to a clock initally at rest at position x or one initially
at rest at position x + L. After the time tacc, the acceleration of each clock ceases and
they continue to move with the same constant relativistic velocity βf , separated by the
distance L, as shown in Fig1b.

3 Time Dilatation of Moving Clocks using ‘Local’

and ‘Non-Local’ Lorentz Transformations

Figure 2: Times indicated at time t = tacc in S by the clocks A, B and C, according to the
space-time LT, for diﬀerent choices of the origin, O′, of S’: a) local LT for both A and B
(x′A = x′B = 0), b) O′ at A, c) O′ at B, d) O′ midway between A and B. Only a) gives
a prediction consistent with translational invariance. Units with a = c = 1 are used and
vf = √3/2, γf = 2, tacc = √3.

It is now assumed that the clocks A and B, introduced above, initially at rest in S,
are subjected to the same uniform acceleration, a, in their own rest frames, at the same
instant in S, in the direction of the positive x-axis, for a time, in S, of duration tacc. The
formulae giving the relativistic velocity, β(t) = v(t)/c, and position, x(t), in the frame S as

3A method for performing such a measurement is described in Reference [7].

a function of the elapsed time, t, in this frame have been give by, for example, Marder [11]
and Nikolic [12]:

The observed time, t′, indicated by the clocks in S , as a function of t is calculated by
integrating the diﬀerential form of the LT of time in accordance with the time variation of
β given by Eqn(3.1). In the ﬁrst case a local LT is used for each clock. This corresponds
to the choice x′ = 0 in the general space-time LT:

That is, the origin of coordinates in S’ is chosen to be at the position of the transformed
space point (the position of the clock A or B). A non-local LT is one in which the origin
of coordinates in S’ is not at the same position as the transformed space point. There
are clearly an inﬁnite number of such LT equations for any transformed space point,
corresponding to an arbitary choice of origin in S’. Situating clock A at x′ = 0, the
diﬀerential form of (3.6) corresponding to Eqn(3.1) is:

where t′ = t′(tacc, x′ = 0) is given by Eqn(3.9). An identical result is, of course, given by
a local LT for clock B. Thus, in this case, translational invariance, as depicted in Fig.1a,
is evidently respected.

A non-local LT is now used to evaluate t′ for the clock B. The origin of the LT in
S’ is chosen at the position of the clock A. The value of t′ for A, t′A, is then given by
Eqns(3.9),(3.11). Now the position of B correponds to a non-local LT with x′B = L. In

Since the procedure described for accelerating the clocks is physically well deﬁned and
unique, the times indicated by the clocks A and B must also be unique, so at most one
of the four cases shown in Fig.2 can be physically correct. Since it has been argued in
Section 2 above that translational invariance requires that the clocks A and B indicate
always the same time, the only possiblity is that shown in Fig.2a, corresponding to a
local LT for each clock. The non-local LT used in Figs.3b,c,d must then be unphysical. In
each of these cases where events contiguous in space-time with one clock, or both clocks,
are subjected to a non-local LT, it can be seen that clock A is apparently in advance of
clock B by the ﬁxed time interval Lβf /c. This is just the apparent eﬀect of ‘relativity
of simultaneity’ resulting from the diﬀerent spatial positions of the clocks introduced in
Einstein’s ﬁrst paper on SR [1]. It results from the term βx′/c in Eqn(3.6). The argument
just presented shows that the physical existence of such an eﬀect is in contradiction with
translational invariance.
It must then be concluded that, if translational invariance is
respected, a non-local space-time LT is unphysical and that ‘relativity of simultaneity’
does not exist. Since LC is a direct consequence of the relativity of simultaneity [7] it also
cannot exist if translational invariance is respected. The LC eﬀect is further discussed in
the following Section.

It may be noted that in all cases shown in Fig.2, the formula (3.11) is valid, on
substituting the appropriate value of t′(tacc). If t1 > t2 > tacc it then follows, independently
of the choice of a local or non-local LT, or of the position of the origin of the latter in S’,
that:

∆t′ = t′1 −

t′2 =

t2
t1 −
γ(tacc)

=

∆t

(3.20)

Thus the rate, as observed in S, of both clocks A and B, after acceleration, is slowed down
in accordance with the well known Time Dilatation (TD) eﬀect, although the actual
times recorded by the clocks do depend on the choice of the S’ origin for the non-local
LT. Indeed, as shown in Fig.2c, for the choice x′A =
L, the clock A is apparently in
advance of the stationary clock C at the end of the acceleration period. The TD eﬀect for
uniformly moving clocks is given by the ∆x′ = 0 projection of the LT [6] and, as shown in
Section 4 below, is deﬁned as the result of successive local LTs performed on the moving
clock. Thus the TD eﬀect is perfectly compatible with translational invariance.

−

It is important for the calculation of t′(t) that the clocks A, B, C be properly syn-
chronised at time t = 0 when they are at rest (see Fig.1a). As discussed at length in
Reference [1] the problem of synchronisation of clocks, situated at diﬀerent spatial po-
sitions, is a non-trivial one. In fact in Reference [1] the ‘relativity of simultaneity’ was
derived by comparing the synchronisation of clocks in a stationary and a moving frame.
However, it is not necessary to discuss clock synchronisation to understand that the phys-
ical situation depicted in Fig2a is the only possible one. For this it is convenient to
introduce ‘radioactive clocks’ which need no synchronisation. If the clocks A, B and C

7

consist of similar samples of radioactive nuclei, equipped with a detector, then the proper
time t′ is determined by the number of radioactive decays, Nobs, recorded. In the limit
that Nobs → ∞

where N0 is the number of unstable nuclei at time t = 0, τN is the mean life of the
radioactive nucleus and ǫ is the eﬃciency of detection. Allowing for the statistical accuracy
in the determination of t′ due to the ﬁnite value of Nobs, it is clear that two such clocks,
initially situated at diﬀerent spatial positions and then subjected to identical acceleration
programs, must record equal values of t′ at at any time t in S. Thus Figs.2b,c,d clearly
correspond to physically impossible situations.

In order to discuss the LC eﬀect it will be convenient to consider the positions of the
clocks A and B, introduced above, for t > tacc. Both clocks then move with their ﬁnal
constant relativistic velocity βf = β(tacc). The separation of the clocks, in both S and S’,

8

is L, as a consequence of the identical acceleration program to which they were subjected.
As in the case of the calculation of t′(t) discussed in the previous Section, diﬀerent LT,
both local and non-local, will be used to calculate the apparent positions of the clocks in
S and the clock synchronisation between S and S’ will be performed during the phase of
uniform motion following acceleration.

xapp
A = L/γf −

The ﬁrst case considered is same as an early discussion of the LC eﬀect by Einstein [13],
and is similar to the presentation of LC given in most text books on SR. The origin of
the coordinate system in S is chosen to coincide, at some instant when the clocks are
synchronised so that t = t′ = 0, with that of S’, which is located at the position of clock
A. Applying the LT Eqn(3.3) then gives xapp
A = 0 at this time, i.e. the apparent position,
according to the local LT at the clock A is the same as the real position of clock A at
t = 0. The LT (3.3), with the above choice of clock synchronisation, is now applied to the
clock B. This non-local LT with x′ = L gives, for the apparent position of B, xapp
B = L/γf .
Thus, the apparent position of B, according to the LT, is shifted from the actual position,
xB = L of B at t = 0. The distance between the apparent positions of A and B is:
xapp
0 = L/γf , the well-known LC eﬀect. The results of repeating this
B −
type of calculation, with diﬀerent choices of the origin in S’, but always synchronising
the clocks so that t = t′ = 0 when the origins of S and S’ coincide, are presented in
Table 1 and shown in Fig.3. Fig.3a shows the real positions of the clocks in either S or
S’. In Fig3b-f the apparent positions of the clocks according to the LT, as observed in
S, are shown for diﬀerent choices of the origin O’ of the LT. In Fig.3b, corresponding to
Einstein’s calculation of Reference [13] the LT is local for A but not for B, In Fig.3c it
is local for B but non-local for A. In Figs3d,e it is non-local for both clocks. Finally, in
Fig.3f it is local for both clocks. Since, as shown in the previous Section, only the case
shown in Fig.3f is consistent with translational invariance of t′(t) this is the only physically
possible solution. In can be seen that, in this case, the real and apparent positions of the
clocks are the same and there is no LC eﬀect. In fact, it is assumed that the local LT are
performed for all points of the spatially extended clocks A and B. Thus the apparent sizes
of the clocks are the same in S and S’ (see Fig.3f). If a ﬁxed origin is chosen in S’ for the
LT of events contiguous in S’ with the clocks, as in Figs.3b-e, the clocks are apparently
contracted, parallel to their direction of motion, by the factor 1/γf .

Indeed it is clear by an even more basic requirement of a physical theory, that it
gives some well deﬁned prediction, that the LC cannot be even an apparent physical phe-
nomenon. There are an inﬁnite number of diﬀerent predictions for the apparent positions
of the moving clocks, in all of which they are separated by the ‘Lorentz-contracted’ dis-
tance L/γf , diﬀering only by the arbitary choice of the position of the origin, O’, of the
non-local LT. In fact the apparent position of, say, xA, can be anywhere on the x-axis
with a suitable choice of O’. As can be seen from the fourth row of Table 1, xA = XA
and xB = XA + L/γf , for any XA, by choosing x′A =
1). The problem here
can be formulated in terms of a general principle that should be obeyed by any accept-
able physical theory. It might be called CIPP for ‘Coordinate Independence of Physical
Predictions’:

γf XA/(γf −
−

The predictions of physical phenomena by any theory must be independent

of any arbitary choice of coordinate system.

Table 1: Apparent positions and times of clocks A and B for diﬀerent choices of origin in
S’. In all cases the clocks in S and S’ are synchronised at t = t′ = 0 when the origins of
S and S’ are coincident.

It is shown clearly in Fig.3 that this principle is not respected by a non-local LT. Since,
for a local LT the arbitariness in the choice of the origin of coordinates is, by deﬁnition,
absent, CIPP is not applicable and unique predictions for the observed of space-time
positions of events in S are always obtained.

As will be discussed in Section 8 below, and unlike for TD, there is no experimental
evidence for the relativity of simultaneity or the LC. The same is true of the two other
eﬀects of SR [6], Space Dilatation (SD), the ∆t′ = 0 projection of the LT, and Time
Contraction (TC) the ∆x = 0 projection of the LT, both of which are also direct conse-
quences of the relativity of simultaneity. On the other hand, the well veriﬁed TD eﬀect
is, by deﬁnition, the prediction of a local LT. Typically, the moving clock is assumed to
be situated at x′ = 0 so that the LT of Eqns(3.3) and (3.4) becomes:

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)
(4.4)

(4.5)

Eqns(4.2) and (4.4) are identical and , by use of Eqn(4.2), Eqn(4.3) reduces to:

Local LT of an event at x′ = 0

which is just the trajectory of the origin of S’ in S. Thus, unlike in the case of a non-local
LT, there is no distinction between the apparent position of the observed event in S and
the actual position, in this frame, of the corresponding point in S’. Eqn(4.4) is just the
TD eﬀect.

Again, Eqns(4.7) and (4.9) are identical, and Eqns(4.7) and (4.8) may be combined to
give:

the trajectory of the origin of S in S’. Eqn(4.9) is the TD eﬀect for a clock at rest in S
when viewed from S’.

Since the spatial position of the transformed event can always be chosen at the origin
of S’, it is proposed here that Eqns(4.1)-(4.10) embody the essential physical content of
the space-time LT. Thus, only time and not space is modiﬁed in the passage from Galilean
to Special Relativity. The local LT diﬀers from the general LT of Eqns(3.4) and (3.5) only
in the speciﬁc choice of origin for the transformed event. As seen above, SR based on
the local LT (4.1)-(4.4) gives, unlike the non-local LT, a unique prediction that respects
In such a theory there is no relativity of simultaneity or the

associated apparent distortions of space and time: LC, SD, TC. The apparent lengths
of physical objects, or their spatial separations, are the same in all inertial frames, and
correspond to the real positions of the objects, described by the usual Galilean kinematical
laws, in each frame. Only the apparent time, described by the TD formula, changes from
one inertial frame to another.
In the following Sections the diﬀerences in space-time
geometry of the local and non-local LT are explored in more detail, as well as relativistic
kinematics, which is shown to be unchanged by the restriction to a local LT.

‘Source Signal Contiguity’ and the Resolution of
Some Causal Paradoxes of Special Relativity

In Section 2 above, the breakdown of translational invariance by a non-local LT was
demonstrated by considering the apparent times of similarly accelerated clocks. This
breakdown is however directly evident, in space, in Figs3a-3e. It is suﬃcient to consider
Fig3b, corresponding to Einstein’s demonstration [13] of the LC. The apparent position
of A is the same as the real position of the clock, whereas for the indentical clock B, only
displaced by the distance L along the x-axis, the apparent position diﬀers by L/2 from
its real one. Since the clocks are identical apart from their position along the x-axis, the
relationship between the real and apparent positions must be the same for both clocks.
Since the non-local LT predicts that this is not the case it clearly violates translational
invariance.

11

Consider now single photons emitted (or reﬂected) from A and B, which, when detected
in S, constitute an observation of the apparent positions of the clocks in this frame.
In S’, the proper frame of the clocks, it is always assumed that the space-time events
corresponding to the photon emission process and that describing the position of the
source, are contiguous. The same is true, in the example of Fig3b, for the space time
event corresponding to the observation of the photon from A in S, and that corresponding
to the real position of A at the time of observation. This is not the case for the photon
emitted by B. Not only is it spacially displaced from the real position of B at the time
of observation, but also, as shown in the ﬁrst row of Table 1, it is emitted from B at the
earlier time, t′ =
βf L/c, when the real position of B is displaced in S by the distance
3/2, as compared to that shown in Fig3a, where the clocks A and B are
f L =
−
separated by one spatial unit. Thus the photon appears to be ‘hanging in time’ in S for
the period γf βf L/c = √3 between its times of emission and observation.

γf β2

−

A similar consideration of the example shown in Fig.3d, presented elsewhere [7], shows
that the photon emitted from A is apparently observed in S before A reaches the position
at which the photon is emitted in S’, thus apparently violating causality. None of these
paradoxes occur when local LT at A and B are used to calculate the apparent positions
of the photons in S as shown in Fig.3f. The observed positions of the photons are then
contiguous in space-time with the real positions of A and B.

The causal paradox of the ‘backward running clocks’ pointed out in a recent paper [14]
is also resolved by use of the local LT. In Fig.1c of Reference [14], the diﬀerent apparent
times registered by the clocks A’,B’ and C’ are due to the term βx′/c in Eqn(3.6) that
leads to ‘relativity of simultaneity’. This ﬁgure shows a similiar eﬀect to that of Fig2b,c,d
of the present paper. In order that the three clocks show the same time when they are
brought to rest, as shown in Fig.1d of Reference [14] (thus, tacitly, imposing the condition
of translational invariance) it is necessary that the clock A’ apparently runs ‘backward in
time’ and C’ ‘forward in time’ during the deceleration. If local LT are used to calculate the
apparent times of A’ and C’ (as is already done, in the example, for B’) all the moving
clocks in Fig.1c of Reference [14] indicate the same apparent time and the paradox is
resolved.

Since essentially all our knowledge of objects in the external world is derived from
our observation (direct or indirect) of photons emitted by, or scattered from, them, it is
only possible to obtain knowledge of the real positions or sizes of such physical objects by
making an assumption, that may be called ‘Source Signal Contiguity’ (SSC). The latter
may be stated as the following physical principle:

Space-time events corresponding to photon emission processes and the

space-time positions of their sources are contiguous in all frames of
observation.

This is the tacit assumption made, for example, in all astronomical measurements
where, say, the diameter of the sun or moon are deduced from a pattern of photons
detected by a telescope. As shown above, the SSC principle is not respected by the
non-local LT. To give another concrete example of this in Astrophysics, consider a star
moving perpendicular to the line of sight with velocity βc relative to the earth, that
explodes, emitting a light pulse of very short duration in its proper frame. As viewed

12

from the earth, with coarse time resolution, the image of the explosion will be, according
to a calculation using a non-local LT, elongated parallel to the velocity direction by the
factor γ due to the SD eﬀect [6]. In S, the observed photons from the star would not
respect the SSC principle. A calculation using a local LT for each emitted photon, after
applying appropriate corrections for light propagation time delays and optical aberration,
does respect SSC and, as in Fig3f, predicts an observed image that faithfully reﬂects the
real spatial distribution of the diﬀerent photon sources in the frame of observation.

It may be remarked that the procedure of deriving a local LT from a non-local one is

either space-like separated (if a LT exists such that ∆t = 0) or time-like separated (if a LT
exists such that ∆x = 0). The Minkowski plot corresponding to a non-local LT, i.e. where
a common origin in S’ is assumed for each pair of spatially separated events, is shown in
Fig.4a. Each pair of space-time points deﬁnes deﬁnes a hyperbola in ∆x, c∆t space. The
hyperbolae of space-like (time-like) separated pairs intersect the ∆x (c∆t) axes at right
angles. Einstein’s ‘relativity of simultaneity’ is reﬂected in the diﬀerent possible signs of
∆t for space-like separated pairs. The local LT gives the Minkowski plot shown in Fig4b.
The hyperbolae describing points with time-like separation are unchanged, whereas those
for space-like separations condense to two points on the ∆x axis. For time-like separated
points, the equations of the hyperbolae are:

Comparison of Fig.4a with 4b, shows that the restriction to a local LT imposed by trans-
lational invariance has the eﬀect of breaking the symmetry of SR under the exchange
of space and time [10]. The form of Fig.4a remains unchanged under the exchange:
c∆t, but this is no longer the case in Fig.4b, where the hyperbolae crossing the
∆x
∆x axis are reduced to points at ∆t = 0.

In order to introduce the description of kinematics by SR, the two arbitary space-
time events 1, 2 just discussed may be replaced by similar space-time events lying along
the space-time trajectory (world-line) of a massive physical object, O(m), of Newtonian
mass m, at rest in S’. Such events are time-like separated and so lie on the hyperbolae
intersecting the c∆t axis at right angles in both Fig.4a and Fig.4b. If the object is situated
at x′ = 0 in S’, then ∆x′ = x′1 −

which is the usual relativistic velocity addition formula. It has been derived here on the
basis of only the local LT between S and S’ and the derivative with respect to the proper
time of the spatial LT between S and S”. Thus, the result is not dependent on the use of
βγx/c that is responsible, in the case of
the LT of time Eqn(3.4), containing the term
a non-local space-time LT, for the unphysical ‘relativity of simultaneity’. Alternatively

In summary, the usual formulae of relativistic kinematics can be derived either by
using only the spatial LT, and a local LT to transform the time, or by taking derivatives
with respect to proper time in both the spatial and temporal LT . No distinction between
‘local’ and ‘non-local’ LT is then required in the derivation of kinematic formulae in
SR. This conclusion may be more directly drawn from inspection of of the Minkowski
plots in Fig.4. Relativistic kinematics concerns only timelike separated events and the
corresponding hyperbolae are the same in Fig.4a (non-local LT) and Fig.4b (local LT).

7 The ‘Lorentz Fitzgerald Contraction’ and the

Michelson-Morley Experiment as a ‘Photon Clock’

As discussed in most text-books on SR, the Lorentz Fitzgerald Contraction hypothesis
was introduced by Fitzgerald [17] and further developed by Lorentz [18] in an attempt to
reconcile the null result of the Michelson-Morley (MM) experiment [19] with the propa-
gation of light as a wave motion in a luminiferous aether, through which the Michelson-
Morley interferometer was conjectured to move with velocity vae. The null result of the
experiment is explained if, due to a dynamical interaction with the aether, the length of
all moving bodies is contracted by the factor

1
q
In Einstein’s SR there is no aether, and the LC eﬀect of the same size as that con-
jectured by Fitzgerald and Lorentz is found to be a geometrical consequence (∆t = 0
projection) of the space-time LT. The usual text-book discussion of the MM experiment,
in terms of SR, claims to explain the null result by invoking a geometrical contraction of
the arm of the interferometer parallel to the direction of motion by the Lorentz-Fitzgerald
factor. Since this is often interpreted as experimental evidence for the LC, which it has
been argued in the previous Sections of the present paper, cannot be a real physical eﬀect,
it is mandatory to now re-examine carefully the description of the MM experiment in SR.

(vae/c)2.

Consider a Michelson interferometer with arms of equal length, L, at rest in the frame
S’. The half-silvered plate is denoted by P and the mirrors by M1 and M2. The arm P-M2

16

is parallel to the direction of uniform motion of the interferometer, with velocity v, in the
frame S (see Fig5a). At time t′ = 0, a pulse of photons moving parallel to the x’-axis is
split by P into two sub-pulses moving along the two arms of the interferometer. Typical
photons moving in the arms P-M1 and P-M2 are denoted as γ1 and γ2 respectively. Each
arm of the interferometer can now be considered as an independent ‘photon clock’ which
measures the proper time interval in S’ corresponding to the time for the photons to
make the round trip from P to the mirrors and back again to P: ∆τ = 2L/c. First,
the conventional argument [20] for the existence of a LC eﬀect for the arm P-M2 will be
examined, before analysing in detail the sequence of events, as predicted by the LT, seen
by an observer in S during the passage of the photons through the interferometer.

The relativistic velocity addition formula (6.23) predicts that photons (or, in general,
any massless particles) have the same velocity, c, in any inertial frame. Under the appar-
ently plausible assumption (to be discussed further below) that the space-time events A
(reﬂection of γ1 from M1, Fig.5b), B (reﬂection of γ2 from M2, Fig.5c) and C (arrival of
both reﬂected photons back at P, ﬁg.5d) can be calculated by following photon trajectories
in the frame S, the following relations are derived:

ctOA =

L2 + v2t2

OA = ctAC =

L2 + v2t2

ctOB = ℓ + vtOB,

Here tOA and tAC refer to time intervals along the trajectory in S of γ1, while tOB and
tBC are similarly deﬁned for γ2. The ‘observed length’ of the arm P-M2 is denoted by ℓ.
The total transit time in S of γ1 is:

while that of γ2 is

Assuming now that γ1 and γ2 are observed in space-time coincidence when they arrive
back at C: tOAC = tOBC, it follows from Eqns(7.3) and (7.4) that:

tOAC = tOA + tAC =

The ‘observed’ length of the arm P-M2 is reduced, compared to its length in S’, by the
same factor as in the LC. However, the space-time observations performed here are quite
diﬀerent to the ∆t = 0 projection that deﬁnes the LC. As will become clear when the
pattern of space-time events seen by an observer in S is calculated in detail, at no point
is a simultaneous observation made of both ends of the arm P-M2. Thus the SR ‘eﬀect’
embodied in Eqn(7.5) is quite distinct from the LC, even though the length contraction
factor is the same.

of P, M1 and M2 so that the observer in S observes space-time events corresponding to
the passage of the photon pulses through P, their reﬂections from M1 and M2 and their
return to P. It is also assumed that the observer in S records the actual (real) position of
the interferometer for comparison with the apparent positions of the signals generated by
the passage of the photons.

Figure 5: The sequence of events observed in S during the passage of photon pulses through
a Michelson interferometer moving with constant velocity β = √3/2. a) initial pulse
arrives at the half-silvered plate, P , and divides into sub-pulses moving along the arms
P-M1 (γ1) and P-M2 (γ2); b) γ1 reﬂects at M1 (event A); c) γ2 reﬂects at M2 (event B);
c) γ1 and γ2 return to P (event C). The origin of S’ is at P . Real positions of the moving
mirrors are indicated by cross-hatched rectangles, apparent ones by open rectangles, or
directly (M2a).

The ﬁrst case considered is a LT with origin in S’ coincident with P. The LT is thus
local for events situated at P or M1 but non-local for events situated at M2. The positions
and times in S’ 4, the apparent positions and times in S, as well as the corresponding real
positions of P of the four events: (i) initial passage of photons through P, (ii) reﬂection
of γ1 from M1, (iii) reﬂection of γ2 from M2 and (iv) return passage of γ1 and γ2 through
P, are presented in Table 2 and shown in Fig.5. In Figs.5, 6 and 7 the real positions in
S of M1 and M2 are denoted by cross-hatched rectangles and their apparent positions
by open rectangles, and also directly (e.g. M2a in Fig.5c). The indicated positions of
the plate P correspond to real positions in S unless otherwise indicated (as Pa). The
apparent positions in S of the photons at the indicated times are those of the tip of the
corresponding arrowhead. The distances and times shown in Figs.5, 6 and 7 correspond,

as previously, to the choice of parameters: L = c = 1, β = √3/2. As shown in Fig.5a,b
and d the events (i), (ii) and (iv) are observed in spatial coincidence with the positions of
P, M1 and, again, P, respectively. However, the events (ii) and (iii), that are simultaneous
in S’, are not so in S. The reﬂection of γ2 on M2 is observed at time γβLc later than the
reﬂection of γ1 from M1. Also the observed reﬂection from M2 is shifted from the actual
position of M2 in S at the time of observation (Fig.5c).

The sequence of events presented in Table 3 and shown in Fig.6 results from choosing
the origin of S’ to be at M2. Now it is only event (iii) that is observed in spatial coincidence
with the actual position of the relevant element of the interferometer (M2). Events (i),
(ii) and (iv) are all observed at apparent positions separated from the actual positions
of P, M1 and, again P, respectively at the times of observation. In addition the whole
γβL/c as compared to those shown in Table 2
sequence of events is shifted in time by
and Fig.5. This is the result of diﬀerent clock synchronisation between S and S’ in the
two cases. For Table 2, the synchronised clock in S is situated at the position of P at
t = 0 (Fig.5a), whereas in Table 3 it is at the position of M2 at t = 0.

−

The same critical remarks must be made concerning the diﬀerent sequences of events
predicted by the non-local LT in Figs.5 and 6, as previously made concerning the diﬀerent
apparent times and positions of the moving clocks in Figs.3b,c and d and Figs.4b,c,d
and e, respectively. They correspond to physically impossible situations where diﬀerent
sequences of events are observed (with apparent positions of the events diﬀerently shifted
from the actual positions of the mirrors and plate) depending only on an arbitary choice
of the origin in S’ of a non-local LT. As in the case of the discussion of the LC in Section
4, the number of diﬀerent possiblities is inﬁnite.
In the general case where the LT is
non-local for all the events (i)-(iv), all of them will be observed at apparent positions
diﬀerent from the actual positions of P, M1 and M2 at the observation times in S. The
sequences of events shown in Figs.5 and 6 clearly violate the ‘CIPP’ principle introduced
in Section 4, as well as the ‘SSC’ principle of Section 5. For example, in the case of Table
2 and Fig.5, the photon reﬂection event and the mirror M2 are contiguous in space-time
in S’, but not, (as shown in Fig.5c) in S. Other examples of the breakdown of SSC in the
frame S are shown in Figs.6a, b and d.

The results of using a local LT with origin in S’ at P for events (i), (ii) and (iv),
and at M2 for event (iii) are presented in Table 4 and shown in Fig.7. In this case the
CIPP principle does not apply since there is no arbitariness in the choice of coordinate
origins, and in all cases SSC is respected. Transmission events and the position of P, and
reﬂection events and the positions of the mirrors, are contiguous in space-time in both
S’ and S. In this case, there is no apparent contraction of the arm P-M2 as the local LT
leaves invariant spatial separations. It is conjectured here that if the gedankenexperiment
just discussed were to be actually performed, the observations would be as in Table 4 and
Fig.7. Indeed, in the case of a non-local LT there is no deﬁnite prediction to be tested,
since what are shown, in Tables 2 and 3, and Figs.5 and 6, are just two of an inﬁnite
number of predictions in each of which apparent events are observed at diﬀerent positions,
relative to the actual positions of the interferometer in S.

It should be remarked that the simple calculation, based on the hypothesis of an
apparent velocity in S of c, recapitulated above, that is used to infer length contraction

21

of the arm P-M2, is consistent with the sequence of events shown if Figs.5 and 6, and
is indeed so for any choice of origin in S’ of the non-local LT. The apparent contraction
of the length of the arm P-M2 by the factor 1/γ is evident in Fig.5c and Fig.6b and d.
The situation is similar to that shown in Fig.3b,c,d and e where, although the non-local
LT predicts diﬀerent apparent positions of the clocks, the apparent distance between the
clocks is constant and shows the LC eﬀect. As already mentioned, it is clear from the
sequences of events presented in Tables 2 and 3 that although the size of the apparent
contraction of the arm P-M2 is the same as for LC (the ∆t = 0 projection of the LT) its
origin is completely diﬀerent, since none of the events listed correspond to simultaneous
observation of P and M2 from S.

It will now be found instructive to consider in more detail the two independent ‘photon
clocks’ constituted by the two arms of the moving interferometer. That corresponding to
the arm P-M1 may be called a ‘transverse’ γ-clock, that to P-M2 as a ‘longitudinal’ one.
By comparing the events listed in Tables 2, 3 and 4, it can be seen that the transverse
γ-clock gives a similar temporal sequence of events for a non-local or local LT. The transit
times from O to A and from A to B (see Fig.5) are equal and given by Eqn(7.1). Direct
calculation using the coordinates presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4 shows that the apparent
distances in S between events (i) and (ii) and between (iii) and (iv), are, in all cases, γL,
while the corresponding elapsed time is γL/c, thus yielding an apparent velocity of c,
consistent with the assumption used to derive Eqn(7.1). The behaviour of the transverse
γ-clock therefore does not depend on the choice of non-local or local LT to analyse its
behaviour. The situation is diﬀerent for the longitudinal γ-clock based on the arm P-M2.
As can be seen from Tables 2 and 3 (the same is true for any other origin in S’ of the
non-local LT) and already mentioned above, the event (iii) is observed to occur in S at
time γβL/c later than (ii). Also the apparent velocity in S of the photon γ2 in both the
path OB and BC is always c, and so is consistent with Eqn(7.2) above. When a local LT
is used to transform every event from S’ to S, as in Table 4, diﬀerent apparent velocities
are found for the paths OB and BC:

Since the total apparent path length according to Table 4 is 2L and the total elapsed time

Since a local LT modiﬁes time intervals but not spatial separations when transforming
events between two inertial frames, and as the apparent velocity is just the ratio of the
spatial separation to the time interval, Eqn(7.8) is natural consequence of the TD eﬀect.
It can be seen from Eqns(7.6), (7.7) and (7.8) that vapp
< c. It
may seem, at ﬁrst sight that Eqns(7.6) and (7.7) are in contradiction with the relativistic
velocity addition formula (6.23). However the meanings of these equations are completely
diﬀerent. Eqn(6.23) describes the relation between velocities of some physical object
as measured in three diﬀerent inertial frames, whereas Eqn(7.6) and (7.7) describe the

observation, from another inertial frame, of a clock that uses the constancy of the velocity
of light propagating over a known ﬁxed distance to deﬁne a time interval.

Finally, in this Section, it may be remarked that Eqn(7.8) has a simple physical in-
terpretation in the case that all space-time events are transformed locally between S’ and
S. When a local LT is used for a moving macroscopic clock (of any type) the movement
of all space points of the clock is apparently slowed down by the universal factor 1/γ.
Compare the longitudinal γ-clock of this type where the photon makes a round trip from
P to M2 and back to P, with a conventional analogue clock, where the hands make a single
rotation, thus also returning to the original conﬁguration. Just as the rate of rotation of
the hand of the clock is apparently slowed down by the fraction 1/γ, due to TD, so too
is the apparent speed of the photon in the γ-clock slowed down by the same factor over
one complete period of operation.

8 A Summary of Experimental Tests of Special Rel-

ativity

In this Section a brief review is made of the experimental tests of SR that have been
performed to date. They can be grouped under four broad categories: (i) tests of Einstein’s
second postulate (universality, isotropy and source motion independence of the velocity
of light) (ii) measurements of the Transverse Doppler Eﬀect, (iii) tests of relativistic
kinematics and (iv) tests of Time Dilatation. Some more general (but model dependent)
tests based on electron and muon g
2 experiments are also brieﬂy mentioned. Finally,
possible indirect evidence for LC derived from models of particle production in nucleon-
nucleon collisions is discussed.

An attempt has been made to be exhaustive concerning the diﬀerent types of test that
have been performed, but not as regards the detailed literature for each type. As far as
possible, the most recent and precise limits are quoted.

Isotropy and Source Independence of the Velocity of Light

The ﬁrst experiment of this type, already discussed in the previous Section, is that of
MM [19]. The limit obtained for the maximum possible velocity, vae, of the Earth relative
to the aether of about 5 km/sec is much less than either the Earth’s orbital speed around
the Sun (30 km/s) or the Earth’s velocity relative to the rest frame of the microwave
background radiation (380 km/s). However, because the MM interferometer had arms of
equal length, the ‘aether drag’ Lorentz Fitzgerald Contraction hypothesis could not be
excluded. This was done by the Kennedy-Thorndike (KT) [21] experiment which was a
repetition of the MM experiment with unequal length arms. In more recent years the
use of laser beams with frequencies servo-locked to standing-wave modes of a Fabry-Perot
interferometer of precisely controlled length [22, 23] has allowed a 300 fold improvement

One of the earliest suggestions to test the independence of the velocity of light from the
motion of its source was that of De Sitter [24] who suggested observation of the periodic
variation of the Doppler eﬀect in the light from binary star systems. If the velocity of
light depends on that of the source according to the classical velocity addition formula, the
half-periods observed using the Doppler eﬀect of each member of the binary system are
predicted to be unequal [25]. It was pointed out by Fox [26] that if the light is scattered
from interstellar matter before arriving at the Earth, then due to the optical ‘Extinction
Theorem’, the source of the observed light is, eﬀectively, the scattering atoms, not the
moving stars, thus invalidating the test. This objection is not applicable to photons in
the X-ray region due to their much smaller scattering cross-section. An analysis [27]
9 in the modiﬁed classical velocity
of pulsating X-ray sources set a limit of k < 2
addition formula: c′ = c+kv. An accelerator experiment, in which the velocity of photons
originating in the decay of π0 mesons of energy about 6 GeV was measured by time-of-
5 [28]. The latter two experiments are, then,

Measurements of the Transverse Doppler Eﬀect

Following the pioneering experiment of Ives and Stilwell [29] using a beam of atomic
hydrogen, the Transverse Doppler Eﬀect (essentially the prediction corresponding to the
ﬁrst term on the RHS of Eqn(6.21)) has been measured using many diﬀerent experimental
techniques: temperature dependence of the M¨ossbauer eﬀect [30], variation of the absorb-
tion of photons from a rotating M¨ossbauer source [31, 32], double photon excitation, by
a single laser, of beams of neon [33, 34] or collinear saturation spectoscopy using a 7Li+
beam with β = 0.064 and two independent laser beams [35] and laser excitation of an
800 MeV (β = 0.84) atomic hydrogen beam [36]. The two photon excitation experiments
measure the pure Transverse Doppler Eﬀect. In Reference [33] this term was measured

Tests of Relativistic Kinematics

As just discussed, relativistic kinematics is already tested, using photons, in the Trans-
verse Doppler Eﬀect experiments. The relativistic kinematics of the electron embodied
in the relation p = γmv provided provided one of the ﬁrst pieces of evidence [37] for the
correctness of the kinematical part of Einstein’s theory of SR. More recent tests of relativis-
tic kinematics using electrons have included measurements of the relation between kinetic
energy and velocity [38] or kinetic energy and momentum [39, 40]. The ﬁrst of these
experiments used a Van de Graﬀ accelerator to produce an electron beam with kinetic
energies from 0.5-15 MeV, whose velocity was subseqently measured by time-of-ﬂight.
The latter two experiments used radioactive β-decay sources, a magnetic spectrometer
to measure the momentum and total absorption detectors to measure the kinetic energy.
An experiment performed at SLAC measured, by time-of-ﬂight, the velocity of 15-20 GeV

Tests of Time Dilatation

Precise test of TD have been performed either by using decaying subatomic particles
as ‘radioactive clocks’, as described in Section 3 above, or by comparing an atomic clock,
at rest on the surface of the Earth, with a similar clock in movement (or that has been
in movement) in an aircraft, a ballistic rocket or a satellite moving around the earth.

In the experiment of Ayres et al. [42] the measured lifetimes of 300 MeV (γ = 2.45)
π± produced at a cyclotron were compared with the known lifetime of pions at rest. The
velocity of the pions, measured by time-of-ﬂight, was used to calculate γ. The time dilated
lifetime was found to agree with the prediction of SR to within 4

Bailey et al. [43] measured the lifetimes of 3.1 GeV (γ = 29.3) µ± decaying in the
storage ring of the last CERN g-2 experiment. The ratio of the muon lifetimes in ﬂight
τ ± to the known values at rest τ ±0 were compared with the quantity γ derived from the
measured cyclotron frequency of the stored muons. For µ+, where the lifetime at rest
is known with the best accuracy, the ratio τ +/τ0 was found to agree with γ to within
4. The physical meaning of this test is discussed in more detail below.

Another important feature of this experiment is the demonstration that the TD eﬀect
depends only on the absolute value of the velocity. The measured eﬀect is the same as in

the world in commercial airliners, once from west to east (WE) and once from east to
west (EW). They were then compared with similar reference clocks at the U.S. Naval
Observatory, thus realising the ‘twins paradox’ of SR in an actual experiment. The
eﬀects of Special Relativity (TD) and of General Relativity (the gravitational red-shift)
were predicted to be of comparable size, but to add on the EW and subtract on the WE

Relativity Tests in Lepton g-2 Experiments

The rate of precession, ωa, of the spin vector of a charged lepton, relative to its
momentum vector, in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, is independent of the energy of the lepton.
Closer examination shows that this fact results from a subtle cancellation of several SR
eﬀects in the three angular frequencies that make up ωa: the Larmor precession frequency,
observed in the laboratory frame, ωL, the Thomas precession frequency, ωT , and the
cyclotron frequency, ωc, In fact [47]:

Test of Length Contraction with Particle Production Models

In the statistical model of particle production in high energy nucleon-nucleon colli-
sions proposed by Fermi [49, 50] and the related hydrodynamical model of Belenkij and
Landau [51], the initial state is supposed to consist of a length-contracted ‘pancake’ of
high density nuclear matter (see, for example, Fig.1 of Reference [50]) which then develops
into the observed multiparticle ﬁnal state. The multiplicity of produced particles is then
expected to be diﬀerent in such models according to whether the volume, V, of the initial
state takes into account, or not, LC. Fermi remarked [50] that the agreement of the model
with experimental measurements ‘seems to indicate that the assumption that the volume,
V, should be Lorentz contracted is not greatly in error.’ However, the following note of
caution was added:‘ One should keep in mind, however, that the number of particles emit-
ted in a collision of this type depends only on the fourth root of the volume V. A change of
a factor of 2 or 3 would produce only a relatively minor variation in the expected number
of particles’. In a later review article Feinberg [52] re-examined the question as to whether
the comparison of such models with experiment could be interpreted as providing positive
evidence for LC, and concluded that this was not the case. With our present knowledge
of the quark substructure of nucleons and of QCD the physical basis of the models of
Fermi and Landau may, of course, be questioned. The present writer concludes, ﬁnally,
on this question, that statistical and hydrodynamical models of particle production do
not provide any convincing experimental evidence for the existence, or not, of the LC as
a physical eﬀect.

9 A Proposal for an Experiment in Space to Test the

Relativity of Simultaneity

The review of experimental tests of SR presented in the previous Section shows that,
at the time of writing, although there is ample experimental conﬁrmation of Einstein’s
second postulate, relativistic kinematics and time dilatation, this is not the case for length
contraction and the other apparent space-time eﬀects: time contraction and space dilata-
tion [6]. This disparity in the experimental veriﬁcation of SR is not at all reﬂected in text
book discussions where no discrimination is made between the well tested TD eﬀect, and
the experimentally untested LC eﬀect. To the writer’s best knowledge, no experiment
has even attempted to observe LC or the relativlty of simultaneity, much less the recently
noted TC and SD eﬀects that are also direct consequences of the relativity of simultaneity.
In this Section a test of the relativity of simultaneity using similar techniques to the pre-
viously performed Spacelab experiment NAVEX (SEN) [46], is proposed. It is essentially
a method to observe the previously proposed [6] TC eﬀect.

The principle of the experiment is illustrated by considering observation of the two
clocks A and B, introduced in Section 2 above, from the ﬁxed position, in the stationary
frame S, of the clock C. The clocks A and B are separated by the ﬁxed distance L in
their common rest-frame, S’, and are synchronised (see Figs.1a, 8a and 9a). The frame S’
moves with uniform velocity v along the x-axis. Clock C is synchronised with B at time
t = t′ = 0 when B has the same x coordinate in S as C. The results of the conventional

27

SR calculation5, choosing the origin in S’ at the position of clock B, and so using a
non-local LT for the clock A, are shown in Table 5 and Fig.8. The results of using a
local LT for both clocks A and B are shown in Table 6 and Fig.9.
In the case of the
non-local LT for A the apparent position of this clock coincides with that of C at time

of the clocks B and A past C. This is just the TC eﬀect (∆x = 0 projection of the LT)
pointed out in Reference [6]. Because clock C is synchronised with B at t = 0 it is easy
to see that, unlike the apparent positions of the clocks discussed in Section 4, the TC
eﬀect is the same for any choice of the origin of the non-local LT in S’. This follows (see
Figs.2b,c,d and Table 1) because the relativity of simultaneity gives always gives the same

Thus, unlike in the case of the prediction of the apparent positions of the clocks, the TC
eﬀect is unambigously predicted for any choice of the origin of the non-local LT, and so
is experimentally testable.

When B passes the ﬁxed clock in S, these clocks are synchronised (t = t′ = 0), as are A

in a) and b) respectively. c) shows the times indicated by the clocks when the apparent
x-position of A coincides with the x-position of C. The origin of S’ is at B, i.e. the LT is

In SEN a cesium clock (that may be identiﬁed with the clock B above) in a Space
Shuttle, executing an almost circular orbit around the Earth, was compared with a similar
ground-based clock (corresponding to clock C above) at the culmination times of the
orbit, i.e. the times at which the distance between the orbiting and ground based clocks
was minimum.
In order to realise the experiment described above, it is suﬃcient to
add a third clock (corresponding to A in the above example) following the same orbit
as B but separated from it by a distance L. Comparison of A and C at culmination,
having previously synchronised B and C at culmination, then essentially realises the ideal
experiment discussed above and so enables a test of the relativity of simultaneity of SR.

assumed. The Space Shuttle was in circular orbit 328 km above the surface of the Earth,

B along their common orbit is then 200km. In this case synchronisation signals can be
exchanged between these clocks above the Earth’s atmosphere. Thus T
TN L = 26
s. Since, to ﬁrst order in β2, γ
1)/γ = β2/2, the usual SR calculation, using
a non-local LT for the clock A, predicts that it will be observed to be in advance of C by
β2/2 = 8.1 ns, whereas the calculation with a local LT for both A and B predicts a
26
delay of the same size. The latter is just the universal TD eﬀect for all clocks at rest in S’,
that is required by translational invariance. The time shifts relative to C are proportional
to T , and so to the separation of A and B along their common orbit. The time shift
should be easily measurable in even a single passage through culmination of clocks B and
A. For example, in SEN, the quoted experimental precision on the combined (SR+GR)
relativistic corrections to the rate of the moving clock corresponded to an experimental
time resolution of about 0.1 ns in the time diﬀerence of clocks B and C over the rotation
period of the Shuttle (1.6 h). The intrinsic uncertainty in the relative rates of B and C
over a period of 26 s, using clocks of the same type as used in SEN, would contribute an
uncertainty of only

The gravitational red shift, due to the Earth’s ﬁeld, has the eﬀect of increasing the
advance, (or decreasing the delay) of A, relative to C, by about 10% for the case of a
non-local, (or local) LT applied to A.

The LC eﬀect for the non-local LT of A results in a smaller value of T : TN L = TL/γ =
β2/2 + O(β4)). In principle, this diﬀerence is measurable if the absolute distance,
TL(1
L, between A and B in S’ is precisely known, as well as the time diﬀerence between
the culminations of A and B and the velocity of the orbiting clocks. Although the ﬁrst
condition can perhaps be met by using interferometry, (the LC eﬀect corresponds to a
60 µm over 200 km) the rotation of the Earth would seem to
diﬀerence of length of
preclude any possiblity to measure the latter quantities with the required uncertainty in
time of about 1 ns in 30 s, and knowledge of the orbit velocity with a similar precision.
The reason for this is that the movement of C on the surface of the Earth between the
culminations of A and B, is expected to modify T by about 4 %; while A is moving the
distance of 200 km so as to occupy the position of B at culmination, the clock C moves
about 8.5 km due to the Earth’s rotation. This is not serious for the tests of TC and TD
since the expected time shifts are, in ﬁrst approximation, simply scaled acording to the
actual value of T . However,the spatial separation between the culminations of A and B
is clearly quite diﬀerent to the ideal case (i.e., neglecting the rotation of the Earth). The
10 in order to test directly
separation must be known with a relative precision of
the LC eﬀect. This hardly seems possible.

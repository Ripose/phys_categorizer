Abstract

By analogy with the original Brans-Dicke relation GM
c2R

∼ 1 , several other similar relations

can be obtained, relating the angular momentum, absolute temperature T , and the cosmological

”constant”, with R , where R , M stand for the radius (scale-factor) and the mass of the causally

related Universe. We show here that these properties, which characterize Machian Universes, can

be derived from the conjecture that the total energy of the Universe is null, and imply that the
like R− 1
angular momentum runs like R2 ; T
increases with R 3

; so that the total entropy of the Universe

ON THE MACHIAN PROPERTIES OF THE
UNIVERSE

Marcelo Samuel Berman

Barbour and Pﬁster(1995), listed several possible meanings generally attributed to a

Machian Universe, among others, as: a) the problem of motion deﬁnition; b) the determi-

nation of inertial frames; c) the interactions between masses; d) the generation of inertia; e)

the induction of inertial forces by means of accelerations, in analogy with electromagnetism;

f) the requirement that the metric tensor should be determined by matter; or by matter

and geometric degrees of freedom for gravity; g) the cosmic derivation of inertial mass by

means of the ADM Hamiltonian; h) the generalization of Special Relativity when gravita-

tion is present; i) the requirement of general covariance of physical laws; j) the existence, or

not, of boundary conditions for the Universe; or the existence or inexistence of matter-free

singularity-free solutions in Cosmology; k) the requirement of physical causality in Nature;

l) the prediction of dragging eﬀects due to the distribution of masses; m) the antidote to

G¨odel-type Universes; n) the explanation of the origin of Brans-Dicke relation; o) the se-

lection among possible cosmological models; p) the non-existence of an absolute dynamical

theory; etc.

We now shall propose that Mach’s Principle, means a zero-total energy Universe.

Berman(2006; 2006a), has shown this meaning of Mach’s Principle without considering a

rotating Universe. We now extend the model, in order to include the spin of the Universe,
∼ 1 , with three diﬀerent relations,
and we replace Brans-Dicke traditional relation, GM
c2R

which we call the Brans-Dicke relations for gravitation, for the cosmological ”constant” ,

and for the spin of the Universe.

We shall consider a ”large” sphere, with mass M , radius R , spin L , and endowed

with a cosmological term Λ , which causes the existence of an energy density
κ = 8πG
c2

. We now calculate the total energy E of this distribution:

Λ
κ

, where

E = Ei + Eg + EL + EΛ + ER

(1)

,

where Ei = Mc2

, stands for the inertial (Special Relativistic) energy; Eg

(the Newtonian gravitational potential self-energy); EL

∼
=

energy; EΛ
ER = aT 4

ΛR3
6G (the cosmological ”constant” energy contained within the sphere), and
stands for absolute temperature, while ER

, where a is a constant, and T

∼
= − GM 2
the Newtonian rotational

R

∼
= L2
M R2

represents radiational energy.

If we impose that the total energy is equal to zero, i.e., E = 0 , we obtain from (1):

GM
c2R

− L2

M 2c2R2 − ΛR3

6GM c2 − ER
M c2

∼
= 1

.

(2)

As relation(2) above should be valid for the whole Universe, and not only for a speciﬁc

instant of time, in the life of the Universe, and if this is not a coincidental relation, we can

solve this equation by imposing that:

GM
c2R = γG

∼
= 1

L
M cR = γL

∼
= 1

ER

M c2 = ρRR3
and,

ΛR3
6GM c2 = γΛ

∼
= 1

M c2 = aT 4R3

M c2 = γR

∼
= 1

,

(4a)

subject to the condition,

γG − γ2
L

− γΛ − γR

∼
= 1

,

where the γ′s are constants having a near unity value.

We now propose the following generalized Brans-Dicke relations, for gravitation, spin,

radiation and cosmological ”constant”:

GM
c2R = γG

∼
= 1

GL
c3R2 = γG . γL

∼

The reader should note that we have termed Λ as a ”constant”, but it is clear from the

above, that in an expanding Universe, Λ ∝ R−2
, so that Λ is a variable term. We also
notice that R ∝ M , and L ∝ R2 , and R ∝ T −2 , so that , we should have, ρR ∝ R−2

.

The B.D. relation for spin, has been derived, earlier, on a heuristic procedure, which

consists on the simple hypothesis that L should obey a similar relation as M (Sabbata
and Sivaram, 1994). The ﬁrst authors to propose the above R−2 dependence for Λ were

Chen and Wu (1990), under the hypothesis that Λ should not depend on Planck’s constant,

because the cosmological ”constant” is the Classical Physics response to otherwise Quantum

eﬀects that originated the initial energy of the vacuum. Berman, as well as Berman and

Som, have examined, along with other authors, a time dependence for Λ(see for example,

Berman, 1991; 1991a).

It must be remarked, that our proposed law (3), is a radical departure from the original

Brans-Dicke (Brans and Dicke, 1961) relation, which was an approximate one, while our
present hypothesis implies that R ∝ M . With the present hypothesis, one can show,

that independently of the particular gravitational theory taken as valid, the energy density
of the Universe obeys a R−2 dependence (see Berman, 2006; 2006a; Berman and Marinho,

2001). In fact, from the deﬁnition:

,

ρ = M
V

while,

V = αR3

,

( α = constant )

ρ =

γG
G α(cid:3)

(cid:2)

R−2

.

(9)

(10)

(11)

where ρ and V stand for energy density and tridimensional volume, we ﬁnd:

If we apply the above relation, for Planck’s and the present Universe, we ﬁnd:

4

−2

ρ

ρP l = h

R
RP l i

.

(12)

If we substitute the known values for Planck’s quantities, while we take for the present
= 1028 cm, we ﬁnd a reasonable result for the present energy density. This shows

Universe, R ∼

that our result (relation 11), has to be given credit. For the energy density of the Λ - term, we
shall have ρΛ = Λ
c2M 2R4 ∝ R−2
κ
; we have also shown above that the radiation energy density is also proportional to R−2
. We conclude that all forms of energy densities are R−2

∝ R−2 , and also for the rotational energy, we have ρL = L2

- dependent, provided that

the generalized Brans-Dicke relations, for gravitation, spin, cosmological ”constant” and

radiation, obey the conditions (3), (7), (7a) and (8) above.

The entropy of the Machian Universe, as described above, is not constant, but increases

with time:

S = sR3

,

where,

S and s

represent total entropy, and entropy density, respectivelly for the

Universe. According to the above formulae, we have:

S ∝ sR3 = ρR

T R3 ∝ T 3R3 ∝ R

3
2

,

taken care of the relations given earlier, i.e., R ∝ T −2

.

We have thus shown that S increases with time, likewise the scale factor to the power

3
2 .This Machian property stands opposite to the usual assumptions in theoretical studies
that, by considering S = constant , found R ∝ T −1

, which as we have shown, is in

incorrect in the Machian picture.

It should be remembered that the origin of Planck’s quantities, say, for length, time,

density and mass, were obtained by means of dimentional combinations among the constants

for macrophysics (G for gravitation and c for electromagnetism) and for Quantum Physics
(Planck’s constant h

2π ). Analogously, if we would demand a dimensionaly correct Planck’s

spin, obviously we would ﬁnd,

LP l = h
2π

.

(13)

5

From Brans-Dicke relation for spin, we now can obtain the present angular momentum

of the Universe,

L = LP l h

R
RP l i

2 ∼

= 10120

h
2π (cid:1)

(cid:0)

= 1093

g cm2 s−1

.

(14)

This estimate was also made by Sabbata and Sivaram(1994), based on heuristic consid-

erations(see also Sabbata and Gasperini, 1979).

If we employ, for the cosmological ”constant” Planck’s value, ΛP l ,

then, we shall ﬁnd, in close agreement with the present value estimate for Λ (as found

by recent supernovae observations), by means of the third Brans-Dicke relation:

Sabbata and Gasperini(1979), have calculated the angular speed of the Universe, for the

present Universe. Though they mixed their calculations with some results obtained from

Dirac’s LNH (Large Number Hypothesis), including a time variation for the gravitational

”constant”, we now show that, if we take for granted that G = constant, and by means

of the generalized Brans-Dicke relations we ﬁnd, by considering a rigid rotating Universe,

ΛP l

∼
= R−2

P l

,

Λ = ΛP l (cid:2)

RP l
R (cid:3)

−2

.

whereby:

L = MR2ω

,

so that,

Mω = constant

, ( because L ∝ R2

as we have shown earlier ), we shall have:

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

ωP l = c

RP l = 2 x 1043 s−1

,

and, for the present,

ω = c
R

∼
= 3 x 10−18 s−1

.

It must be pointed out, that the result (18) seems to us that was not published elsewhere,

up to now. This is, however, the ﬁrst time that the above results are obtained by means of

6

the zero-total energy hypothesis for the Universe. This is why we attribute this hypothesis

to a Machian Universe; indeed, we believe that we can identify Mach’s Principle, with this

hypothesis.

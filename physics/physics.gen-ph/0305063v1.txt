Abstract

According to modern quantum physics, at the microlevel, the dimen-
sion of space-time is ≥ 11; we only observe 4 dimensions because the
others are compactiﬁed: the size along each of the other dimensions is
much smaller than the macroscale. There is no universally accepted ex-
planation of why exactly 4 dimensions remain at the microscopic level. A
natural suggestion is: maybe there is no fundamental reason why exactly
4 dimensions should remain, maybe when we go to even larger scales, some
of the 4 dimensions will be compactiﬁed as well? In this paper, we explore
the consequences of the compactiﬁcation suggestion, and we show that –
on the qualitative level – these consequences have actually been already
observed: as superclusters and as evidence that is usually interpreted as
justifying dark matter. Thus, we get a new possible explanation of both
superclusters and dark matter evidence – via dimension compactiﬁcation.

Keywords: dimension compactiﬁcation, superclusters, dark matter

Main idea. According to modern quantum physics, at the microlevel, space-
time has at least 11 dimensions; we only observe 4 dimensions in our macroob-
servations because the rest are compactiﬁed: the size along each of the remaining
directions is so small that on macrolevel, these dimensions can be safely ignored;
see, e.g., [Green et al. 1988, Polchinski 1998].

There is no universally accepted explanation of why exactly 4 dimensions
remain at the microscopic level. A natural suggestion is: maybe there is no
fundamental reason why exactly 4 dimensions should remain. Maybe when we
go to even larger scales, some of the 4 dimensions will be compactiﬁed as well?
Could one rigorously argue for “compactiﬁcation” when these eﬀects must
occur over the accessible, kiloparsec and larger, scales? In modern physics,
indeed, compactiﬁcation is related to quantum-size distances, but there is noth-

paper that proposed compactiﬁcation – the 1938 paper by A. Einstein and
P. Bergmann [Einstein and Bergmann 1938] – described it as simply the extra
dimension being a circle, so that the entire space-time looks like a thin cylinder
whose width is negligible if we operate at large enough scales.

In this paper, we explore the consequences of the compactiﬁcation sugges-
tion, and we show that – on the qualitative level – these consequences have
actually been already observed: as superclusters and as evidence that is usually
interpreted as justifying dark matter. Thus, we get a new possible explanation of
both superclusters and dark matter evidence – via dimension compactiﬁcation.

Geometric consequences of the main idea. If our idea is correct, then, as
we increase the scale, we will observe how a 3D picture is replaced by a 2D and
then by a 1D one. This is exactly what we observe: while at a macrolevel, we see
a uniform distribution of galaxies in a 3D space, at a larger-scale level, galaxies
start forming superclusters – long and thin strands of clusters and galaxies; see,
e.g., [Fairall 1998]. Superclusters are either close to a 2D shape (as the “Great
Wall” discovered in the 1980s) or close to 1D.

Towards physical consequences of the main idea. How does the change
in dimension aﬀect physics? In non-relativistic approximation, the gravitation
potential ϕ is related to the mass density ρ by the Laplace equation △ϕ = ρ.
In the 3D space, this leads to Newton’s potential ∼ 1/r, with the force

in a 2D space, we get potential ∼ log(r), with the force

F (r) =

G0 · m1 · m2
r2

;

F (r) =

G1 · m1 · m2
r

for some constant G1. For intermediate scales, it is reasonable to consider a
combination of these two forces:

F (r) =

G0 · m1 · m2
r2

+

G1 · m1 · m2
r

.

(1)

In the Appendix, we explain, on the qualitative level, why such combination
naturally follows from the above compactiﬁcation idea.

Let us consider the simplest possible compactiﬁcation (along the lines of
the original Einstein-Bergmann paper), where the space-time is wrapped as
a cylinder of circumference R along one of the coordinates. What will the
gravitational potential look like in this simple model? The easiest way to solve
the corresponding Newton’s equation in this cylinder is to “unwrap” the cylinder
into a full space. After this “unwrapping”, each particle in a cylindrical space (in
particular, each source of gravitation) is represented as inﬁnitely many diﬀerent
bodies at distances R, 2R, etc., from each other. For further simplicity, let us
consider the potential force between the two bodies on the wrapping line at a

2

distance r from each other. The eﬀect of the second body on the ﬁrst one in
cylindrical space is equivalent to the joint eﬀect of multiple copies of the second
body in the unwrapped space:

(cid:0)❅

(cid:0)❅

r

R

(cid:0)❅

R

(cid:0)❅

R

(cid:0)❅

The resulting gravitational potential of a unit mass can be described as a

sum of potentials corresponding to all these copies, i.e.,

ϕ(r) =

+

1
r

1
r + R

+

1
r + 2R

+ . . . +

1
r + k · R

+ . . .

(2)

From the purely mathematical viewpoint, this sum is inﬁnite. From the physical
viewpoint, however, the actual potential is not inﬁnite: due to relativistic eﬀects,
at the current moment of time t0, the inﬂuence of a source at a distance d =
r + k · R is determined by this source’s location at a time t0 − d/c (where c is the
speed of light). Thus, we only need to add the terms for which d/c is smaller
than the age of the Universe. As a result, we can ignore the slowly increasing
inﬁniteness of the sum when k → ∞.

How can we estimate this potential? The formula (2) has the form

f (0) + f (1) + . . . + f (k) + . . . ,

It is diﬃcult to get an analytical
where we denoted f (x)
expression for the exact sum, but we can use the fact that this sum is an integral

is equivalent to approximating the function f (x) on the interval [k, k + 1] by
its value f (k) at the left endpoint of this interval – i.e., by the ﬁrst term in
the Taylor expansion of the function f (x) around the point k. A natural next
approximation is when instead of only taking the ﬁrst term, we consider the
ﬁrst two terms in this Taylor expansion, i.e., when on each interval [k, k + 1], we

Physical consequences of
The force described
according to Kuhn, Mil-
is exactly the force that,
by formula (1)
grom,
[Kuhn and Krugliak 1987, Milgrom 1983, Milgrom 2002,
Sanders and McGaugh 2002], is empirically needed to describe the observations
if we want to avoid dark matter.
Indeed, in Newtonian mechanics, for any
large-scale rotating gravitational system, if we know the rotation speed v at a
distance r from the center, we can ﬁnd the mass Mg(r) inside the sphere of
radius r by equating the acceleration v2/r with the acceleration G0 · Mg(r)/r2
provided by the Newton’s law. As a result, we get Mg(r) = r · v2/G0. Alterna-
tively, we can also count masses of diﬀerent observed bodies and get ML(r) –
the total mass of luminescent bodies. It turns out that ML(r) ≪ Mg(r) – hence
the traditional explanation that in addition to luminescent bodies, there is also
“dark” (non-luminescent) matter.

4

An alternative explanation is not to introduce any new unknown type of
matter – i.e., assume that Mg(r) ≈ ML(r) – but rather change the expression
for the force, or, equivalently, assume that the gravitational constant G0 is not
a constant but it may depend on r: G0 = G(r). Equating the acceleration
v2/r with the acceleration G(r) · ML(r)/r2 provided by the new gravity law,
we can determine G(r) as G(r) = v2 · r/ML(r). Observation data show that
G(r) = G0 + G1 · r for some constant G1 – i.e., that the dependence of the
gravity force on distance is described by the formula

F (r) =

G(r) · m1 · m2
r2

=

G0 · m1 · m2
r2

+

G1 · m1 · m2
r

,

which is exactly what we deduced from our dimension compactiﬁcation idea.

This idea has been proposed 20 years ago, and one of the reasons why it
has not been universally accepted is that it was diﬃcult to get a natural ﬁeld
theory explanation of this empirical law. We have just shown that such an
empirical explanation comes naturally if we consider the possibility of dimension
compactiﬁcation.

This explanation is in line with Milgrom’s own explanation; see, e.g.,

[Milgrom 2003].

As we go further up in scale, one more dimension starts compactifying, so we
start getting a 1D space in which Laplace equation leads to potential ϕ(r) ∼ r.
Thus, at a large-scale level, we should have a term proportional to r added to
the normal gravity potential formulas. This additional term is exactly what is
add when we take a cosmological constant Λ into consideration.

Observable predictions of our new idea. A possible observable consequence
of the additional term ϕ(r) ∼ r is that it leads to an additional constant term in
the gravitational force and therefore, to a formula G(r) = G0 + G1 · r + G2 · r2.
Thus, if the empirical dependence of G(r) on r turns out to be not exactly
linear but rather slightly quadratic, it will be a strong argument in favor of our
compactiﬁcation idea.

Natural open questions. In this paper, we simply formulate the idea and
explain why we believe this idea to be prospective. Many related questions are
still open:

• how to concoct a geometry that accomplishes “compactiﬁcation” – what

would a metric look like that transitions from large to small scales?

• could we solve for the force law in such a geometry with some rigor?

• will such a profound geometrical perturbation as the one we propose have
other consequences beyond a force law change? perhaps not, but it is
worth investigating.

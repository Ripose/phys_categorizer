A Brief Note on Jupiter’s Magnetism

Abstract

A recent model which gives the contribution of the earth’s solid

core to geo magnetism is seen to explain Jupiter’s magnetism also.

As is known Jupiter exhibits an earth like dipole magnetism ∼ 104 times that
of the earth. Geo magnetism is explained by the dynamo model of the earth’s
liquid core. The planet Jupiter however is qualitatively diﬀerent. Though
like the earth it has a hot solid metallic core, which has a radius of about 20
times that of the earth’s solid core, this is however surrounded by a 60,000
kilometres thick Hydrogen mantle[1].
Recently it was suggested that the earth’s solid core contributes signiﬁcantly
to geomagnetism[2]. This is based on the fact that below the Fermi temper-
ature, Fermions would have an anomalous semionic character - that is they
would obey a statistics inbetween the Fermi-Dirac and the Bose-Einstein [3].
This would have the consequence that the magnetization density in such a
situation, which is given by the well known expression[4]

where µ is the electron magnetic moment, N+ is the average number of
Fermions with spin up out of an assembly of N Fermions, now has the value
∼ µN

V , owing to the fact that

Inequality (2) expresses the semionic behaviour.
Remembering that the core density of Jupiter is of the same order as that
of the earth, while the core volume is about 104 times that of the earth, we
have N ∼ 1052, so that the magnetization MV , from (1) ∼ 104 times the
earth’s magnetism, as required.
Finally, as pointed out in ref.[2], owing to the semionic behaviour as expressed
by (2), the magnetization would be sensitive to external magnetic inﬂuences,
and we could have magnetic reversals as in the case of the earth.
Incidentally it may be pointed out that the same model could also explain
the magnetism of Neutron stars and White Dwarfs (cf.ref.[2]).

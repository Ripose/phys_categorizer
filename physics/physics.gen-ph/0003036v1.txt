Why in our Universe the laws of thermodynamics are valid? In the paper is demonstrated the
reason of it: if the time and the space are multifractal and the Universe is in an equilibrium state
the laws of the thermodynamics are consequences of it’s multifractal structure.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well known, that the multifractal sets have the
characteristics very similar to the characteristics of a
physical quantities (a free energy, an entropy, a tempera-
ture etc) with which these characteristics can be formally
compared. The connections between the characteristics
of multifractal set and characteristics of physical quanti-
ties formally correspond to connections between the ther-
modynamic quantities. This surprising correspondence
till now is completely inexplicable. In the present paper
the multifractal analysis advanced in by Mandelbrot [1],
[2], Renyi [3], Halsy [4], etc. (see for example, Rudolf [5])
was used for a substantiation of thermodynamics laws on
the base of the supposition that the space and the time
are multifractal sets. If our Universe state is the state of
equilibrium (or the state nearly equilibrium) the connec-
tions between the global characteristics of Universe as a
whole (multifractal time and space) and their local frac-
tal characteristics will be the same that thermodynamic
laws (it is shown on the basis of the fractal theory of
time and space (see [6] - [8]). From the point of view of
the fractal theory of time and space the thermodynamics
relations (as well as thermodynamics in whole) are con-
sequence of the multifractal structure (structure of time
and space) of our Universe.

In the theory [6] - [8] the time and the space are treated
as a real physical ﬁelds. These ﬁelds consist of small mul-
tifractal subsets of time and space (”elements” of time
and space), in turn, approximately treated as ”points”.
Multifractal sets of time and space deﬁned on a set of the
carrier of a measure Rn, and contain all characteristics of
the real world by reﬂected it’s in their fractional dimen-
sions. The fractal dimensions dtr (or dt and dr) in small
neighborhood of points t, r, for these ”points” (belonging
the sets of t) are global dimensions. At the same time
for all space - time continuum these dimensions are local
fractal dimensions (Gelder exponents). The purpose of
the paper is the establishment of connection between the
global and the local characteristics of multifractal space
and time on the basis of the multifractal analysis. We
suppose that the state of the Universe (consisting from
multifractal time and spatial sets) may be described as

the state close to a thermodynamic equilibrium. The es-
tablishment of such connections enables on to view the
new reason of origin of thermodynamic relations exist-
ing in our world, reducing it to presence of the fractal
properties at time and space. We shall show, that the
thermodynamic relations used in physics are a natural
consequence of known mathematical connections between
the multifractal characteristics of the Universe (Universe
is considered as multifractal space - time set described
within the framework of the fractal theory of time and
space [6] - [8]). Thus thermodynamics can be considered
as a natural consequence of multifractal characteristics
of time and space of the world in which we live.

II. CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL
AND MULTIFRACTAL CHARACTERISTICS IN

THE MULTIFRACTAL UNIVERSE

Let’s consider the Universe as a dynamic system at the
state that close to a thermodynamic equilibrium (at the
present stage of it’s development), deﬁned on a multifrac-
tal set X. Let the state of the Universe is characterized
by fractal dimensions of a space - time continuum and
by mean values of an internal energy, a free energy, an
entropy, a temperature. If the state of Universe is close
to the thermodynamic equilibrium, it’s characteristics is
possible to describe by a free energy F , entropy S, inter-
nal energy E and temperature T . Let the Universe has
a multifractal nature stipulated by fractional dimensions
of time and space (according to the fractal theory of time
and space [6] - [8]) and is characterized by multifractal
set X(r, t) it’s space - time points. The multifractal set
X is deﬁned on the carrier of a measure (set Rn with
topological dimensions), i.e. X isthesubsetof Rn. Let
the set of the carrier of a measure is characterized by
the temperature T0, by the internal energy E0 = T0 (in
the system in which the Boltzmann constant is equal to
unity), by a free energy F0. Let’s deﬁne a measure µ
on the set X and consider connection between invariant
scaling characteristics of the multifractal Universe with
a measure µ on the basis of the theory [6] - [8] and hy-
pothesis about the origin of the Universe as a result of

1

explosion (big bang). Because of multifractality of space
- time sets, the scaling transformations (at measuring
volume of the Universe with the help of covering by four-
dimension orbs (or cubes) with radius δ), for example, for
mean values of probability of the casual mass distribu-
tion < pq > (or the random distributions of densities of
energy of physical ﬁelds), will look like (see, for example,
[4] - [5])

< pq >∼ δτ (q+1)

(1)

where q is scale factor bound with q-dimensions Renyi

dimq

B(X) by relation

dimq

B(X) =

τ (q)
q − 1

(2)

The dimension Renyi characterizes global scailing char-
acteristics of the Universe. For deﬁnition of it’s physical
sense we shall consider local properties of the Universe
near to the point r, t. The local fractal dimensions in this
point (Gelder’s exponent) according to [6] - [8] looks like

α(x) ≡ dt,r(~r(t), t) = 4 + X
i

βiLi,t~r(~r(t), t)

(3)

where Li,t~r are densities of energy of physical ﬁelds
in this point and characterized by the densities of La-
grangians. The quantity pi in a neighborhood of a point
(r, t) is transformed as

pi ∼ δdtr (~r(t),t)

From deﬁnition of q-dimensions Renyi

dimq

B(~r, t) =

1

q − 1

limδ→0

pq
i

log P
logδ

i

follows

dimq

B(~r, t) =

qd(~r(t), t

q − 1

(4)

(5)

(6)

The fractal dimensions d(r, t) in (3) are the dimension-
less internal energies (after multiplication on E0 the rela-
tion (3) and correspond an internal energies of Universe
in a point with coordinates (r, t)) and so, for q >> 1,
follows

dimq

B(~r, t) ≈ d(~r(t), t)

(7)

Therefore the dimq

B(X) should has sense of an ener-
gies. For describing of a thermodynamic equilibrium of
the Universe there are only two energies (internal E and
free F ) and E0 is bound with dtr(r, t), therefore the di-
mensions Renyi there corresponds to a free energy of the
Universe (F divided by E0 ) in the q - state. Let’s deﬁne
now q - state. From (2) follows, as the Universe cools
down and also it’s temperature is decrease and it’s vol-
ume grows, that q must depends on temperature and will

2

increase with Universe cooling. The simplest dimension-
less function satisfying to this requirement is the function

T = T0/T

(8)

Now it is necessary to deﬁne a function of state of the
Universe - the entropy S. Let’s consider subsets S ′(α)
(of the set X) with identical Gelder’s exponents drt = α
(in our case it corresponds to a selection of an isoener-
getic sets of the ”internal energy” of the Universe). In
this case joining of subsets S ′(α), stratifying original set
X, will coincide with the original set. Let’s introduce a
spectrum of fractal dimensions f (α ).The joining of all
such subsets makes set X. Let’s the fractal dimensions
of set S(α(q)) (obtained as a result of such stratifying) is
f (α(q)) (spectrum of singularities). For each value of q
the state of the Universe is determined as a single-valued
state and at alteration q (that is decreasing of energy
of the Universe because of decreasing of it’s tempera-
ture) and expansion of the Universe) function f (α(q)) ,
describing scaling properties of set S(α(q)), will grows.
Such behavior corresponds to behavior of an entropy (a
q - entropy) which we shall designate by S. Hence, to the
every state of Universe there corresponds a spectrum of
singularities f (α(q)) equal to an q - entropy S.

III. CONNECTION OF A FREE ENERGY AND

AN ENTROPY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A

MULTIFRACTAL NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE

We use now the known relation of the multifractal anal-
ysis between q-dimensions Renyi, spectrum of a singu-
larity f (α(q)) and local fractal dimensions q, (see, for
example, [5])

(q − 1)dimq

B(X) = qα(q) − f (α(q))

(9)

For T << T0, substituting in (9) instead of dimen-
sions Renyi the spectrum of singularities f (α(q)), the lo-
cal fractal dimensions α(q) and the scaling factor q their
physical values (that we have received earlier) the rela-
tion reads

F = E − T S

(10)

The relation (10) is the basic relation of the thermody-
namics. As relation (10) is fulﬁlled for the Universe as a
whole, it will be fulﬁlled and for it’s parts with the state
of thermodynamically equilibrium. Therefore in the Uni-
verse with the multifractal time and space the realization
of the laws of thermodynamics is a simple consequence
of it’s structure.

The analysis of connections of global dimensions and
local fractal characteristics of the fractal space - time car-
ried out above allows to make the following statements,
that are true for a case of equilibrium (or nearly so by
equilibrium) of the state of the Universe:

It is possible to ﬁnd, using (9), the entropy (i,e. the

spectrum of fractal dimensions f (T0/T ) = f (q));

e) The thermodynamics in viewed model is a conse-
quence of the multifractality of space - time continuum.

IV. CONCLUSION

The problem of a substantiation of the thermodynam-
ics within the frame- work of the fractal theory of time
and space presented in this paper, (as well as a substan-
tiation of irreversibility of time and spatial events (see
[9]) is reduced to a postulating of multifractal properties
of space and time. If model of fractal time and spaces [6]
- [8] is correct, the Universe is open system and exchange
it’s energy with the carrier of a measure Rn (or with the
alien Universe of inﬂationary model [9] or model [10]).

Each of existing types of the electric charges come forwards in the system
as the source of a kind of the dipole moment. Therefore, to investigate these
regularities we have established the compound structures of Dirac and Pauli
form factors. They state that the electron possesses as well as the anomalous
electric charge.

Owing to the vector nature of virtual photon, the elastic scattering of
electrons by spinless nuclei depends on the Dirac F1e(q2) and Pauli F2e(q2)
form factors of light leptons [1]. They are of course the functions of the
square of four - dimentional momentum transfer. However, in spite of large
number of works dedicated to the interaction between the electron and ﬁeld
of emission, thus far remains many uncertainties both in the structures and
in the behavior of these currents. Usually it is accepted that F2e(0) is equal to
the electron anomalous magnetic moment [2], and its full magnetic moment
is deﬁned by the combination [3] of form factors [4]

F1e(0)

+ F2e(0).

It appears that here F1e(0) gives the electric charge leading to the appear-

ance of the electron normal magnetic moment.

Such a procedure were based actually on the assumption [5] of that the
functions F1e(q2) and F2e(q2) are not the Fourier transforms of the spatial
distributions of the electric charge and magnetic moment of a particle. This
is explained by some consequences of the classical model of an extensive
electron [6].

According to the classical theory of electromagnetic mass [7], the avail-
ability of the eigenenergy E0 of the electron electrostatic ﬁeld implies the
existence of the electric part of the electron rest mass:

mem

e =

E0
c2 .

The opinion has been speaked out that all the mass of the electron is
equal to its electromagnetic mass. Such an idea called simply a hypothesis
of ﬁeld mass and testiﬁes in favor of the unsteadity of charge distribution of
the electron.

We start from the duality of matter that the mass and charge of a particle
correspond to the most diverse form of the same regularity of the nature of
this ﬁeld [8, 9]. It states that each of all possible types of charges arises as
a consequence of the availability of a kind of the inertial mass [10]. Thereby
such a mechanism leads to the appearance of the intraelectron interratio
between the forces of the electric and unelectric nature. Therefore, the charge
distribution of the electron must be steady.

The purpose of the present work is to discuss some consequences and
implications implied from the above - mentioned regularities of the nature of

as the form factors F1e(q2) and F2e(q2) was used are not in the states to
explain the observed vector picture of the electron. For understanding the
mechanism of the anomalous interaction of Pauli at the fundamental level,
one must elucidate the compound structures of these functions.

From such a purpose, we not only must write the form factors Fie(q2) in

the form

Fie(q2

) = fie(0) + Aie( ~q2) + ...

but also need conclude that each of existing types of the electric charges
come forwards in the system as the source of a kind of the dipole moment.
Herewith the independent components fie(0) coincide with the normal size
of the electric charge and magnetic moment of the electron:

f1e(0) = enorm

The second terms Aie( ~q2) characterize the dependence of form factors on
the square of three - dimensional momentum transfer ~q2 and at the emission
of a real photon ( ~q2=0) are reduced to the values

sofar as the full electric mass is concerned, we will start from the fact that

same regularity of its electric nature. Therefore, we conclude [9] that

So, it is seen that any of form factors F1e(q2) and F2e(q2) includes in self

mentum transfer (q2 = 0) deﬁnes the full static size of the electric charge and

in assuming that the size of A2e(0) is equal to the electron Schwinger magnetic
moment:

To brighter reveal our ideas one must apply to the process of elastic scat-
tering of electrons and their neutrinos by spinless nuclei as to the source of
unique information about structures of leptonic currents. It is already clear
from (2) that in the case of one - photon exchange only the independent
components of form factors are responsible for the interaction with matter.
Therefore, a study of the behavior of light leptons (l = e, νe) in the nucleus
charge ﬁeld leads us to the equation [9]

2mnorm

f1l(0)

= ±1.

Comparison of (12) with (8) say in favor of correspondence principle which
states that each terms of the expansions (2) correspond to the deﬁnite ap-
proximations [9]. Under such circumstances the possibility of the inclusion
of the anomalous phenomena Aie( ~q2) in the discussion is realized only in the
second Born approximation. Nevertheless, without loss of generality, we must
have in view of that any non - zero component of the interaction of Pauli im-
plies the availability of a kind of the Dirac interaction. Of course, the above
- noted regularities of vector picture of the electron and its neutrino open up
new possibilities for developments of our sights at the nature of matter.

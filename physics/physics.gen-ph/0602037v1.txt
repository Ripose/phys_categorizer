and of the stable mesons and baryons

The rest masses of the electron and muon, as well as of the stable mesons and
baryons can be explained, within 1% accuracy, with the standing wave model,
which uses only photons, neutrinos, charge and the weak nuclear force. We do
not need hypothetical particles for the explanation of the masses of the electron,
muon, mesons and baryons. We can also explain the spin of the stable baryons,
the absence of spin in the stable mesons and the spin of e±, µ± and τ ± without
any additional assumption. And we can determine the rest masses of the e, µ and
τ neutrinos.

Introduction

The so-called “Standard Model” of the elementary particles has, until now,
not come up with a precise theoretical determination of the masses of either
the mesons and baryons or of the leptons, which means that neither the mass
of the fundamental electron nor the mass of the fundamental proton have
been explained although the quarks, which are said to explain the mesons
and baryons, have been introduced by Gell-Mann [1] forty years ago. The
masses of the quarks which are considered range from zero rest mass to values
from 1.5 to 4.5 MeV for e.g. the u-quark, according to the Review of Particle
Physics [2], to values on the order of 100 MeV. Suppose one has agreed on
deﬁnite values of the masses of the various quarks, then one stands before the
same problem one faces with the conventional elementary particles, namely
one has to explain why do the quarks have their particular masses and what
are they made of. There are many other attempts to explain the elementary
particles or only one of the particles, too many to list them here. For example
El Naschie has, in the last years, proposed a topological theory for high energy
particles and the spectrum of the quarks [3-6].

The need for the present investigation has been expressed by Feynman [7]
as follows: “There remains one especially unsatisfactory feature: the observed
masses of the particles, m. There is no theory that adequately explains these
numbers. We use the numbers in all our theories, but we do not understand
them - what they are, or where they come from.
I believe that from a
fundamental point of view, this is a very interesting and serious problem”.
Today, twenty years later, we still stand in front of the same problem.

1 The spectrum of the masses of the particles

As we have done before [8] we will focus attention on the so-called “stable”
mesons and baryons whose masses are reproduced with other data in Tables
1 and 2. It is obvious that any attempt to explain the masses of the mesons
and baryons should begin with the particles that are aﬀected by the fewest
parameters. These are certainly the particles without isospin (I = 0) and
without spin (J = 0), but also with strangeness S = 0, and charm C = 0.
Looking at the particles with I,J,S,C = 0 it is startling to ﬁnd that their
masses are quite close to integer multiples of the mass of the π0 meson. It
is m(η) = (1.0140 ± 0.0003) · 4m(π0), and the mass of the resonance η′ is
m(η′) = (1.0137 ± 0.00015) · 7m(π0). Three particles seem hardly to be
suﬃcient to establish a rule. However, if we look a little further we ﬁnd
that m(Λ) = 1.0332 · 8m(π0) or m(Λ) = 1.0190 · 2m(η). We note that the
Λ particle has spin 1/2, not spin 0 as the π0, η mesons. Nevertheless, the
mass of Λ is close to 8m(π0). Furthermore we have m(Σ0) = 0.9817 · 9m(π0),
m(Ξ0) = 0.9742 · 10m(π0), m(Ω−) = 1.0325 · 12m(π0) = 1.0183 · 3m(η), (Ω−
is charged and has spin 3/2). Finally the masses of the charmed baryons are
m(Λ+
c) = 1.0093 · 18m(π0), m(Ξ0
c)
= 1.0167 · 18m(π0), and m(Ω0

c) = 1.0017 · 20m(π0).
Now we have enough material to formulate the integer multiple rule, ac-
cording to which the masses of the η, Λ, Σ0, Ξ0, Ω−, Λ+
c, and Ω0
c
particles are, in a ﬁrst approximation, integer multiples of the mass of the
π0 meson, although some of the particles have spin, and may also have charge
as well as strangeness and charm. A consequence of the integer multiple rule
must be that the ratio of the mass of any meson or baryon listed above
divided by the mass of another meson or baryon listed above is equal to
the ratio of two integer numbers. And indeed, for example m(η)/m(π0) is
practically two times (exactly 0.9950 · 2) the ratio m(Λ)/m(η). There is also

We will call, for reasons to be explained later, the particles discussed
above, which follow in a ﬁrst approximation the integer multiple rule, the
γ-branch of the particle spectrum. The mass ratios of these particles are in
Table 1. The deviation of the mass ratios from exact integer multiples of
m(π0) is at most 3.3%, the average of the factors before the integer multiples
of m(π0) of the nine γ-branch particles in Table 1 is 1.0066 ± 0.0184. From
a least square analysis follows that the masses of the ten particles on Table
1 lie on a straight line given by the formula

m(N)/m(π0) = 1.0065 N − 0.0043

N > 1,

(1)

where N is the integer number nearest to the actual ratio of the particle mass
divided by m(π0). The correlation coeﬃcient in equation (1) has the nearly
perfect value r2 = 0.999.

The integer multiple rule applies to more than just the stable mesons
and baryons. The integer multiple rule applies also to the γ-branch baryon
resonances which have spin J = 1/2 and the meson resonances with I,J = 0,
listed in [2] or in Tables 2,3 in [8]. The Ω− particle will not be considered
because it has spin 3/2 but would not change the following equation signiﬁ-
cantly. If we combine the particles in Table 1 with the γ-branch meson and
baryon resonances, that means if we consider all mesons and baryons of the
γ-branch, “stable” or unstable, with I ≤ 1, J ≤ 1/2 then we obtain from a
least square analysis the formula

m(N)/m(π0) = 1.0056 N + 0.0610

N > 1,

(2)

with the correlation coeﬃcient 0.9986. The line through the points is shown
in Fig. 1 which tells that 22 particles of the γ-branch of diﬀerent spin and
isospin, strangeness and charm; eight I,J = 0,0 mesons, thirteen J = 1/2
baryons and the π0 meson with I,J = 1,0, lie on a straight line with slope
1.0056. In other words they approximate the integer multiple rule very well.
Spin 1/2 does not seem to aﬀect the integer multiple rule, i.e. the ratios of
the particle masses, neither does strangeness S 6= 0 and charm C 6= 0.

Searching for what else the π0, η, Λ, Σ0, Ξ0, Ω− particles have in common,
we ﬁnd that the principal decays (decays with a fraction > 1%) of these par-

ticles, as listed in Table 1, involve primarily γ-rays, the characteristic case
is π0 → γγ (98.8%). We will later on discuss a possible explanation for the
1.198% of the decays of π0 which do not follow the γγ route but decay via
π0 → e+ + e− + γ. After the γ-rays the next most frequent decay product
of the heavier particles of the γ-branch are π0 mesons which again decay into
γγ. To describe the decays in another way, the principal decays of the par-
ticles listed above take place always without the emission of neutrinos ; see
Table 1. There the decays and the fractions of the principal decay modes are
given, taken from the Review of Particle Physics. We cannot consider decays
with fractions < 1%. We will refer to the particles whose masses are ap-
proximately integer multiples of the mass of the π0 meson, and which decay
without the emission of neutrinos, as the γ-branch of the particle spectrum.
To summarize the facts concerning the γ-branch. Within 0.66% on the

5

average the masses of the particles of the γ-branch are integer multiples
(namely 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and even 17, 18, 20) of the mass of the π0 meson. It
is improbable that nine particles have masses so close to integer multiples
of m(π0) if there is no correlation between them and the π0 meson. It has,
on the other hand, been argued that the integer multiple rule is a numerical
coincidence. But the probability that the mass ratios of nine particles of the
γ-branch fall by coincidence on integer numbers between 1 and 20 instead on
all possible numbers between 1 and 20 with two decimals after the period is
smaller than 10−20, i.e nonexistent. The integer multiple rule is not aﬀected
by more than 3% by the spin, the isospin, the strangeness, and by charm.
The integer multiple rule seems even to apply to the Ω− and Λ+
c particles,
although they are charged. In order for the integer multiple rule to be valid
the deviation of the ratio m/m(π0) from an integer number must be smaller
than 1/2N, where N is the integer number closest to the actual ratio m/m(π0).
That means that the permissible deviation decreases rapidly with increased
N. All particles of the γ-branch have deviations smaller than 1/2N.

The remainder of the stable mesons and baryons are the π±, K±,0, p, n,
s particles which make up the neutrino-branch (ν-branch) of the

D±,0, and D±
particle spectrum. The ratios of their masses are given in Table 2.

These particles are in general charged, exempting the K0 and D0 mesons
and the neutron n, in contrast to the particles of the γ-branch, which are
in general neutral.
It does not make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence whether one
considers the mass of a particular charged or neutral particle. After the
π mesons, the largest mass diﬀerence between charged and neutral particles
is that of the K mesons (0.81%), and thereafter all mass diﬀerences between
charged and neutral particles are < 0.5%. The integer multiple rule does not
immediately apply to the masses of the ν-branch particles if m(π±) (or m(π0))
is used as reference, because m(K±) = 0.8843 · 4m(π±). 0.8843 · 4 = 3.537 is
far from integer. Since the masses of the π0 meson and the π± mesons diﬀer
by only 3.4% it has been argued that the π± mesons are, but for the isospin,
the same particles as the π0 meson, and that therefore the π± mesons cannot
start another particle branch. However, this argument is not supported by
the completely diﬀerent decays of the π0 mesons and the π± mesons. The
π0 meson decays almost exclusively into γγ (98.8%), whereas the π± mesons
decay practically exclusively into µ mesons and neutrinos, as in π+ → µ+ +
νµ (99.9877%). Furthermore, the lifetimes of the π0 and the π± mesons diﬀer
by nine orders of magnitude, being τ (π0) = 8.4 · 10−17 sec versus τ (π±) =
2.6 · 10−8 sec.

If we make the π± mesons the reference particles of the ν-branch, then
we must multiply the mass ratios m/m(π±) of the above listed particles with
an average factor 0.848 ± 0.025, as follows from the mass ratios on Ta-
ble 2. The integer multiple rule may, however, apply directly if one makes
m(K±) the reference for masses larger than m(K±). The mass of the neutron
is 0.9516 · 2m(K±), which is only a fair approximation to an integer multi-
ple. There are, on the other hand, outright integer multiples in m(D±) =
s ) = 0.9968 · 4m(K±). A least square
0.9954 · (m(p) + m(¯n)), and in m(D±
analysis of the masses of the ν-branch in Table 2 yields the formula

m(N)/0.853m(π±) = 1.000 N + 0.00575

N > 1,

(3)

with r2 = 0.998. This means that the particles of the ν-branch are integer
multiples of m(π±) times the factor 0.853. One must, however, consider
that the π± mesons are not necessarily the perfect reference for all ν-branch
particles, because π± has I = 1, whereas for example K± has I = 1/2 and S
= ±1 and the neutron has also I = 1/2. Actually the factor 0.853 in Eq.(3)
is only an average. The mass ratios indicate that this factor decreases slowly
with increased m(N). The existence of the factor and its decrease will be
explained later.

Contrary to the particles of the γ-branch, the ν-branch particles decay
preferentially with the emission of neutrinos, the foremost example is π± →
µ± + νµ(¯νµ) with a fraction of 99.9877%. Neutrinos characterize the weak
interaction. We will refer to the particles in Table 2 as the neutrino branch
(ν-branch) of the particle spectrum. We emphasize that a weak decay of the
particles of the ν-branch is by no means guaranteed. Although the neutron
decays via n → p + e− + ¯νe in 887 sec (100%), the proton is stable. There are,
on the other hand, decays as e.g. K+ → π+π−π+ (5.59%), but the subsequent
decays of the π± mesons lead to neutrinos and e±. The decays of the particles
in the ν-branch follow a mixed rule, either weak or electromagnetic.

To summarize the facts concerning the ν-branch of the mesons and bary-
ons. The masses of these particles seem to follow the integer multiple rule if
one uses the π± mesons as reference, however the mass ratios share a common
factor 0.85 ± 0.025.

To summarize what we have learned about the integer multiple rule: In
spite of diﬀerences in charge, spin, strangeness, and charm the masses of the
mesons and baryons of the γ-branch are integer multiples of the mass of the
π0 meson within at most 3.3% and on the average within 0.66%. Correspond-

8

ingly, the masses of the particles of the ν-branch are, after multiplication with
a factor 0.85 ± 0.025, integer multiples of the mass of the π± mesons. The
integer multiple rule has been anticipated much earlier by Nambu [9], who
wrote in 1952 that “some regularity [in the masses of the particles] might
be found if the masses were measured in a unit of the order of the π-meson
mass”. A similar suggestion has been made by Fr¨ohlich [10]. The integer
multiple rule suggests that the particles are the result of superpositions of
modes and higher modes of a wave equation.

2 Standing waves in a cubic lattice

We will now study, as we have done in [11], whether the so-called “stable”
particles of the γ-branch cannot be described by the frequency spectrum
of standing waves in a cubic lattice, which can accommodate automatically
the Fourier frequency spectrum of an extreme short-time collision by which
the particles are created. The investigation of the consequences of lattices
for particle theory was initiated by Wilson [12] who studied a cubic fermion
lattice. This study has developed over time into lattice QCD.

It will be necessary for the following to outline the most elementary as-
pects of the theory of lattice oscillations. The classic paper describing lattice
oscillations is from Born and v. Karman [13], henceforth referred to as B&K.
They looked at ﬁrst at the oscillations of a one-dimensional chain of points
with mass m, separated by a constant distance a. This is the monatomic
case, all lattice points have the same mass. B&K assume that the forces
exerted on each point of the chain originate only from the two neighboring
points. These forces are opposed to and proportional to the displacements,
as with elastic springs (Hooke’s law). The equation of motion is in this case

m¨un = α(un+1 − un) − α(un − un−1) .

(4)

The un are the displacements of the mass points from their equilibrium posi-
tion which are apart by the distance a. The dots signify, as usual, diﬀerenti-
ation with respect to time, α is a constant characterizing the force between
the lattice points, and n is an integer number. For a → 0 Eq.(4) becomes
the wave equation c2∂2u/∂x2 = ∂2u/∂t2 (B&K).

In order to solve Eq.(4) B&K set

un = Aei(ω t + nφ) ,

(5)

9

which is obviously a temporally and spatially periodic solution or describes
standing waves. n is an integer, with n < N, where N is the number of points
in the chain. φ = 0 is the monochromatic case. We also consider higher
modes, by replacing nφ in Eq.(5) by ℓnφ, with integer ℓ > 1. The wavelengths
are then shorter by 1/ℓ. At nφ = π/2 are nodes, where for all times t the
displacements are zero, as with standing waves f(x,t) = A cos(ωt) cos(nφ) =
A cos(ωt) cos(kx). If a displacement is repeated after n points we have na =
λ, where λ is the wavelength, a the lattice constant, and it must be nφ = 2π
according to (5). It follows that

λ = 2πa/φ .

(6)

(7)

Inserting (5) into (4) one obtains a continuous frequency spectrum of the

standing waves as given by Eq.(5) of B&K

ω = ± 2

α/m sin(φ/2) .

q

B&K point out that there is not only a continuum of frequencies, but also a
maximal frequency which is reached when φ = π, or at the minimum of the
possible wavelengths λ = 2a. The boundary conditions are periodic, that
means that un = un+N , where N is the number of points in the chain. Born
referred to the periodic boundary condition as a “mathematical convenience”.
The number of normal modes must be equal to the number of particles in
the lattice.

Born’s model of the crystals has been veriﬁed in great detail by X-ray
scattering and even in much more complicated cases by neutron scattering.
The theory of lattice oscillations has been pursued in particular by Blackman
[14], a summary of his and other studies is in [15]. Comprehensive reviews
of the results of linear studies of lattice dynamics have been written by Born
and Huang [16], by Maradudin et al. [17], and by Ghatak and Kothari [18].

3 The masses of the γ-branch particles

We will now assume, as seems to be quite natural, that the particles con-
sist of the same particles into which they decay, directly or ultimately. We
know this from atoms, which consist of nuclei and electrons, and from nuclei,
which consist of protons and neutrons. Quarks have never appeared among
the decay products of elementary particles. For the γ-branch particles our

10

assumption means that they consist of photons. Photons and π0 mesons
are the principal decay products of the γ-branch particles, the characteristic
example is π0 → γγ (98.8%). Table 1 shows that there are decays of the
γ-branch particles which lead to particles of the ν-branch, in particular to
pairs of π+ and π− mesons. It appears that this has to do with pair pro-
duction in the γ-branch particles. Pair production is evident in the decay
π0 → e+ + e− + γ (1.198%) or in the π0 meson’s third most frequent decay
π0 → e+e−e+e− (3.14·10−3%). Pair production requires the presence of elec-
tromagnetic waves of high energy. Anyway, the explanation of the γ-branch
particles must begin with the explanation of the most simple example of its
kind, the π0 meson, which by all means seems to consist of photons. The
composition of the particles of the γ-branch suggested here oﬀers a direct
route from the formation of a γ-branch particle, through its lifetime, to its
decay products. Particles that are made of photons are necessarily neutral,
as the majority of the particles of the γ-branch are.

We also base our assumption that the particles of the γ-branch are made
of photons on the circumstances of the formation of the γ-branch particles.
The most simple and straightforward creation of a γ-branch particle are
the reactions γ + p → π0 + p, or in the case that the spins of γ and p
are parallel γ + p → π0 + p + γ′. A photon impinges on a proton and
creates a π0 meson. The considerations which follow apply as well for other
photoproductions such as γ + p → η + p or γ + d → π0 + d, but also for
the electroproductions e− + p → π0 + e− + p or e− + d → π0 + e− + d,
see Rekalo et al. [19].

In γ + p → π0 + p the pulse of the incoming electromagnetic wave is in
10−23 sec converted into a continuum of electromagnetic waves with frequen-
cies ranging from 1023 sec−1 to ν → ∞ according to Fourier analysis. There
must be a cutoﬀ frequency, otherwise the energy in the sum of the frequencies
would exceed the energy of the incoming electromagnetic wave. The wave
packet so created decays, according to experience, after 8.4 · 10−17 sec into two
electromagnetic waves or γ-rays. It seems to be very unlikely that Fourier
analysis does not hold for the case of an electromagnetic wave impinging on
a proton. The question then arises of what happens to the electromagnetic
waves in the timespan of 10−16 seconds between the creation of the wave
packet and its decay into two γ-rays? We will show that the electromag-
netic waves can continue to exist for the 10−16 seconds until the wave packet
decays.

If the wave packet created by the collision of a γ-ray with a proton consists

11

of electromagnetic waves, then the waves cannot be progressive because the
wave packet must have a rest mass. The rest mass is the mass of a particle
whose center of mass does not move. However standing electromagnetic waves
have a rest mass. Standing electromagnetic waves are equivalent to a lattice,
because in standing waves the waves travel back and forth between the nodes,
just as lattice points oscillate between the nodes of the lattice oscillations.
The oscillations in the lattice take care of the continuum of frequencies of the
Fourier spectrum of the collision. So we assume that the very many photons
in the wave packet are held together in a cubic lattice. It is not unprecedented
that photons have been considered to be building blocks of the elementary
particles. Schwinger [20] has once studied an exact one-dimensional quantum
electrodynamical model in which the photon acquired a mass ∼ e2. On the
other hand, it has been suggested by Sidharth [21] that the π0 meson consists
of an electron and a positron which circle their center of mass.

We will now investigate the standing waves in a cubic photon lattice.
We assume that the lattice is held together by a weak force acting from one
lattice point to its nearest neighbors. We assume that the range of this force
is 10−16 cm, because the range of the weak nuclear force is on the order of
10−16 cm, as stated e.g. on p.25 of Perkins [22]. For the sake of simplicity
we set the sidelength of the lattice at 10−13 cm, the exact size of the nucleon
is given in [23] and will be used later. With a = 10−16 cm there are then
109 lattice points. As we will see the ratios of the masses of the particles
are independent of the sidelength of the lattice. Because it is the most
simple case, we assume that a central force acts between the lattice points.
We cannot consider spin, isospin, strangeness or charm of the particles. The
frequency equation for the oscillations in an isotropic monatomic cubic lattice
with central forces is, in the one-dimensional case, given by Eq.(7). The
direction of the oscillation is determined by the direction of the incoming
wave.

According to Eq.(13) of B&K the force constant α is

α = a (c11 − c12 − c44) ,

(8)

where c11, c12 and c44 are the elastic constants in continuum mechanics which
applies in the limit a → 0. If we consider central forces then c12 = c44 which is
the classical Cauchy relation. Isotropy requires that c44 = (c11 − c12)/2. The
waves are longitudinal. Transverse waves in a cubic lattice with concentric
forces are not possible according to [18]. All frequencies that solve Eq.(7)

12

(9)

(12)

come with either a plus or a minus sign which is, as we will see, important.
The reference frequency in Eq.(7) is

ν0 =

α/4π2m ,

q

or as we will see, using Eq.(11), ν0 = c⋆/2πa.

The limitation of the group velocity has now to be considered. The group

velocity is given by

cg =

The group velocity of the photons has to be equal to the velocity of light c⋆
throughout the entire frequency spectrum, because photons move with the
velocity of light. In order to learn how this requirement aﬀects the frequency

the equation for the group velocity is

c⋆ = a

cg = c⋆ · df /dφ .

For photons that means, since cg must then always be equal to the velocity
of light c⋆, that df/dφ = 1. This requirement determines the form of the
frequency distribution regardless of the order of the mode of oscillation or it
means that instead of the sine function in Eq.(7) the frequency is given by

ν = ± ν0( φ + φ0 ) .

(13)

For the time being we will disregard φ0 in Eq.(13). The frequencies of
the corrected spectrum in Eq.(13) must increase from ν = 0 at the origin φ
= 0 with slope 1 (in units of ν0) until the maximum is reached at φ = π.
The energy contained in the oscillations must be proportional to the sum of
all frequencies (Eq.14). The second mode of the lattice oscillations contains

13

4 times as much energy as the basic mode, because the frequencies are twice
the frequencies of the basic mode, and there are twice as many oscillations.
Adding, by superposition, to the second mode diﬀerent numbers of basic
modes or of second modes will give exact integer multiples of the energy of
the basic mode. Now we understand the integer multiple rule of the particles
of the γ-branch. There is, in the framework of this theory, on account of
Eq.(13), no alternative but integer multiples of the basic mode for the energy
contained in the frequencies of the diﬀerent modes or for superpositions of
diﬀerent modes.
In other words, the masses of the diﬀerent particles are
integer multiples of the mass of the π0 meson, assuming that there is no spin,
isospin, strangeness or charm.

We remember that the measured masses in Table 1, which incorporate
diﬀerent spins, isospins, strangeness and charm, spell out the integer mul-

there is no free parameter if one takes the ratio of the energies contained in

the frequency distributions of the diﬀerent modes, because the factor
in Eq.(7) or ν0 in Eq.(13) cancels. This means, in particular, that the ratios
of the frequency distributions, or the mass ratios, are independent of the
mass of the photons at the lattice points, as well as of the magnitude of the
force between the lattice points.

q

It is obvious that the integer multiples of the frequencies are only a ﬁrst
approximation of the theory of lattice oscillations and of the mass ratios of
the particles. The equation of motion in the lattice Eq.(4) does not apply
in the eight corners of the cube, nor does it apply to the twelve edges nor,
in particular, to the six sides of the cube. A cube with 109 lattice points is
not correctly described by the periodic boundary condition we have used to
derive Eq.(7), but is what is referred to as a microcrystal. A phenomeno-
logical theory of the frequency distributions in microcrystals, considering in
particular surface waves, can be found in Chapter 6 of Ghatak and Kothari
[18]. Surface waves may account for the small deviations of the mass ratios
of the mesons and baryons from the integer multiple rule of the oscillations
in a cube. However, it seems to be futile to pursue a more accurate deter-
mination of the oscillation frequencies before we know what the interaction
of the electron with mass is. The mass of the electron is 0.378% of the mass
of the π0 meson and hence is a substantial part of the deviation of the mass
ratios from the integer multiple rule.

Let us summarize our ﬁndings concerning the particles of the γ-branch.

14

The π0 meson is the basic mode. The η meson corresponds to the second
mode, as is suggested by m(η) ≈ 4m(π0). The Λ particle corresponds to the
superposition of two second modes, as is suggested by m(Λ) ≈ 2m(η). This
superposition apparently results in the creation of spin 1/2. The two modes
would then have to be coupled. The Σ0 and Ξ0 baryons are superpositions
of one or two basic modes on the Λ particle. The Ω− particle corresponds to
the superposition of three coupled second modes as is suggested by m(Ω−) ≈
3m(η). This procedure apparently causes spin 3/2. The charmed Λ+
c particle
seems to be the ﬁrst particle incorporating a third mode. Σ0
c is apparently the
superposition of a negatively charged basic mode on Λ+
c , as is suggested by
the decay of Σ0
c is that it is the superposition
of two coupled third modes. The superposition of two modes of the same type
is, as in the case of Λ, accompanied by spin 1/2. The Ω0
c baryon is apparently
the superposition of two basic modes on the Ξ0
c particle. All neutral particles
of the γ-branch are thus accounted for. The modes of the particles are listed
in Table 1.

c. The easiest explanation of Ξ0

We have also found the γ-branch antiparticles, which follow from the
negative frequencies which solve Eq.(7) or Eq.(13). Antiparticles have al-
ways been associated with negative energies. Following Dirac’s argument
for electrons and positrons, we associate the masses with the negative fre-
quency distributions with antiparticles. We emphasize that the existence of
antiparticles is an automatic consequence of our theory.

All particles of the γ-branch are unstable with lifetimes on the order of
10−10 sec or shorter. Born [24] has shown that the oscillations in cubic lattices
held together by central forces are unstable. It seems, however, to be possible
that the particles can be unstable for reasons other than the instability of the
lattice. For example, pair production seems to make it possible to understand
the decay of the π0 meson π0 → e− + e+ + γ (1.198%). Since in our model
the π0 meson consists of a multitude of electromagnetic waves it seems that
pair production takes place within the π0 meson, and even more so in the
higher modes of the γ-branch where the electrons and positrons created by
pair production tend to settle on mesons, as e.g. in η → π+ +π− +π0 (22.6%)
or in the decay η → π+ + π− + γ (4.68%), where the origin of the pair of
charges is more apparent. Pair production is also evident in the decays η →
e+e−γ (0.6%) or η → e+e−e+e− (6.9·10−3%).

Finally we must explain the reason for which the photon lattice or the
γ-branch particles are limited in size to a particular value of about 10−13
cm, as the experiments tell. Conventional lattice theory using the periodic

15

boundary condition does not limit the size of a crystal, and in fact very large
crystals exist. If, however, the lattice consists of standing electromagnetic
waves the size of the lattice is limited by the radiation pressure. The lattice
will necessarily break up at the latest when the outward directed radiation
pressure is equal to the inward directed elastic force which holds the lattice
together. For details we refer to [25].

4 The rest mass of the π0 meson

So far we have studied the ratios of the masses of the particles. We will now
determine the mass of the π0 meson in order to validate that the mass ratios
link with the actual masses of the particles. The energy of the π0 meson is

E(m(π0)) = 134.9766 MeV = 2.1626 · 10−4 erg.

The sum of the energies E = hν of the frequencies of all standing one-
dimensional waves in π0 seems to be given by the equation

Eν =

f (φ)dφ .

Nhν0

(14)

This equation originates from B&K. N is the number of all lattice points.
The total energy of the frequencies in a cubic lattice is equal to the num-
ber N of the oscillations times the average of the energy of the individual
In order to arrive at an exact value of N in Eq.(14) we have
frequencies.
to use the correct value of the radius of the proton, which is rp = (0.880 ±
0.015) · 10−13 cm according to [23] or rp = (0.883 ± 0.014) · 10−13 cm accord-
ing to [26]. With a = 10−16 cm it follows that the number of all lattice points
in the cubic lattice is

N = 2.854 · 109 .

(15)

The radius of the π± mesons has also been measured [27] and after further
analysis [28] was found to be 0.83 · 10−13 cm, which means that within the
uncertainty of the radii we have rp = rπ. And according to [29] the charge
radius of Σ− is (0.78 ± 0.10) · 10−13 cm.

If the oscillations are parallel to an axis, the limitation of the group
velocity is taken into account, that means if Eq.(13) applies and the absolute

16

values of the frequencies are taken, then the value of the integral in Eq.(14)
is π2. With N = 2.854 · 109 and ν0 = c⋆/2πa it follows from Eq.(14) that the
sum of the energy of the frequencies of the basic mode corrected for the group
velocity limitation is Ecorr = 1.418·109 erg. That means that the energy is
6.56·1012 times larger than E(m(π0)). This discrepancy is inevitable, because
the basic frequency of the Fourier spectrum after a collision on the order of
10−23 sec duration is ν = 1023 sec−1, which means, when E = hν, that one
basic frequency alone contains an energy of about 9 m(π0)c2
⋆.

To eliminate this discrepancy we use, instead of the simple form E = hν,
the complete quantum mechanical energy of a linear oscillator as given by
Planck

E =

hν
ehν/kT − 1

.

(16)

This equation was already used by B&K for the determination of the speciﬁc
heat of cubic crystals or solids. Equation (16) calls into question the value of
the temperature T in the interior of a particle. We determine T empirically
with the formula for the internal energy of solids

,

u =

RΘ
eΘ/T − 1
which is from Sommerfeld [30]. In this equation R = 2.854 · 109 k, where k is
Boltzmann’s constant, and Θ is the characteristic temperature introduced by
Debye [31] for the explanation of the speciﬁc heat of solids. It is Θ = hνm/k,
where νm is a maximal frequency. In the case of the oscillations making up
the π0 meson the maximal frequency is νm = πν0, therefore νm = 1.5 · 1026
sec−1, and we ﬁnd that Θ = 7.2 · 1015 K.

(17)

In order to determine T we set the internal energy u equal to m(π0)c2
⋆.
It then follows from Eq.(17) that Θ/T = 30.20, or T = 2.38 · 1014 K. That
means that Planck’s formula (16) introduces a factor 1/(eΘ/T − 1 ) ∼= 1/e30.2
= 1/(1.305·1013) into Eq.(14).
In other words, if we determine the tem-
perature T of the particle through Eq.(17), and correct Eq.(14) accordingly
then we arrive at a sum of the oscillation energies in the π0 meson which
is 1.0866·10−4 erg = 67.82 MeV. That means that the sum of the energies
of the one-dimensional oscillations consisting of N waves is 0.502 E(m(π0)).
We have to double this amount because standing waves consist of two waves
traveling in opposite direction with the same absolute value of the frequency.

17

The sum of the energy of the oscillations in the π0 meson is therefore

Eν(π0)(theor) = 2.1732 · 10−4 erg = 135.64 MeV = 1.005 E(m(π0))(exp) ,

(18)
if the oscillations are parallel to the φ axis. The energy in the measured mass
of the π0 meson and the energy in the sum of the oscillations agree fairly well,
considering the uncertainties of the parameters involved.

To sum up: We ﬁnd that the energy in the rest mass of the π0 meson and
the other particles of the γ-branch is correctly given by the sum of the energy
of standing electromagnetic waves in a cube, if the energy of the oscillations
is determined by Planck’s formula for the energy of a linear oscillator. The
π0 meson is like an adiabatic, cubic black body ﬁlled with standing electromag-
netic waves. We know from Bose’s work [32] that Planck’s formula applies
to a photon gas as well. For all γ-branch particles we have found a simple
mode of standing waves in a cubic lattice. Since the equation determin-
ing the frequency of the standing waves is quadratic it follows automatically
that for each positive frequency there is also a negative frequency of the
same absolute value, that means that for each particle there exists also an
antiparticle. For the explanation of the mesons and baryons of the γ-branch
we use only photons, nothing else. This is a rather conservative explanation
of the π0 meson and the γ-branch particles which does not use hypothetical
particles.

From the frequency distributions of the standing waves follow the ratios
of the masses of the particles which obey the integer multiple rule.
It is
important to note that in this theory the ratios of the masses of the γ-branch
particles to the mass of the π0 meson do not depend on the sidelength of the
lattice, and the distance between the lattice points, neither do they depend
on the strength of the force between the lattice points nor on the mass of
the lattice points. The mass ratios are determined only by the spectra of the
frequencies of the standing electromagnetic waves.

5 The neutrino branch particles

The masses of the neutrino branch, the π±, K±,0, n, D±,0 and D±
s particles, are
integer multiples of the mass of the π± mesons times a factor 0.85 ± 0.02 as we
stated before. We assume, as appears to be quite natural, that the π± mesons
and the other particles of the ν-branch consist of the same particles into

18

which they decay, that means in the case of the π± mesons of muon neutrinos,
anti-muon neutrinos, electron neutrinos, anti-electron neutrinos and of an
electron or positron, as exempliﬁed by the decay sequence π± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ),
µ± → e± + ¯νµ(νµ) + νe(¯νe). The absence of an electron neutrino νe in
the decay branches of π− or of an anti-electron neutrino ¯νe in the decay
branches of π+ can be explained with the composition of the electron or
positron, which will be discussed in Section 8. The existence of neutrinos
and antineutrinos is unquestionable. Since the particles of the ν-branch
decay through weak decays, we assume, as appears likewise to be natural,
that the weak nuclear force holds the particles of the ν-branch together. The
existence of the weak nuclear force is also unquestionable. Since the range of
the weak interaction, which is about 10−16 cm [22], is only about a thousandth
of the diameter of the particles, which is about 10−13 cm, the weak force can
hold particles together only if the particles have a lattice structure, just as
macroscopic crystals are held together by microscopic forces between atoms.
In the absence of a force which originates in the center of the particle and
aﬀects all neutrinos of the particle the conﬁguration of the particle is not
spherical but cubic, reﬂecting the very short range of the weak nuclear force.
We will show that the energy in the rest mass of the ν-branch particles is the
energy in the oscillations of a cubic lattice consisting of electron and muon
neutrinos and their antiparticles, plus the energy in the rest masses of the
neutrinos.

First it will be necessary to outline the basic aspects of diatomic lattice
oscillations. In diatomic lattices the lattice points have alternately the masses
m and M, as with the masses of the electron neutrinos m(νe) and muon
neutrinos m(νµ). The classic example of a diatomic lattice is the salt crystal
with the masses of the Na and Cl atoms in the lattice points. The theory
of diatomic harmonic lattice oscillations was started by Born and v. Karman
[13]. They ﬁrst discussed a diatomic chain. The equation of motions in the
chain are according to Eq.(22) of B&K

m¨u2n = α(u2n+1 + u2n−1 − 2u2n) ,

M¨u2n+1 = α(u2n+2 + u2n − 2u2n+1) ,

(19)

(20)

where the un are the displacements, n an integer number and α a constant
characterizing the force between the particles. Eqs.(19,20) are solved with

19

u2n = Aei(ω t + 2nφ),

u2n+1 = Bei(ω t + (2n+1)φ) ,

(21)

(22)

where A and B are constants and φ is given by φ = 2πa/λ as in Eq.(6). a is
the lattice constant as before and λ the wavelength, λ = na. The solutions
of Eqs.(21,22) are obviously periodic in time and space and describe again
standing waves. Using (21,22) to solve (19,20) leads to a secular equation
from which according to Eq.(24) of B&K the frequencies of the oscillations
of the chain follow from

4π2ν2

± = α/Mm · ((M + m) ±

(M − m)2 + 4mMcos2φ ) .

(23)

q
Longitudinal and transverse waves are distinguished by the minus or plus

sign in front of the square root in (23).

6 The masses of the ν-branch particles

The characteristic case of the neutrino branch particles are the π± mesons
which can be created in the process γ + p → π− + π+ + p. A photon
impinges on a proton and is converted in 10−23 sec into a pair of particles
of opposite charge. Fourier analysis dictates that a continuum of frequencies
must be in the collision products. The waves must be standing waves in
order to be part of the rest mass of a particle. The π± mesons decay via
π± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ) (99.98770%) followed by e.g. µ+ → e+ + ¯νµ + νe (≈ 100%).
Only µ mesons, which decay into charge and neutrinos, and neutrinos result
from the decay of the π± mesons. The emission of µ± is avoided in the decay
π± → e± + νe(¯νe) (1.23·10−2 %). If the particles consist of the particles into
which they decay, then the π± mesons are made of neutrinos, antineutrinos
and e±. Since neutrinos interact through the weak force which has a range
of 10−16 cm according to p.25 of [22], and since the size of the π± mesons
[28] is on the order of 10−13 cm, the ν-branch particles must have a lattice
with N neutrinos.
It is not known with certainty that neutrinos actually
have a rest mass as was originally suggested by Bethe [33] and Bahcall [34]
and what the values of m(νe) and m(νµ) are. However, the results of the
Super-Kamiokande [35] and the Sudbury [36] experiments indicate that the
neutrinos have rest masses. The neutrino lattice must be diatomic, meaning

20

that the lattice points have alternately larger (m(νµ)) and smaller (m(νe))
masses. We will retain the traditional term diatomic. The term neutrino
lattice will refer to a lattice consisting of neutrinos and antineutrinos. The
lattice we consider is shown in Fig. 2. Since the neutrinos have spin 1/2 this
is a four-Fermion lattice. The ﬁrst investigation of cubic Fermion lattices in
context with the elementary particles was made by Wilson [12]. A neutrino
lattice is electrically neutral. Since we do not know the interaction of the
electron with a neutrino lattice we cannot consider lattices with a charge.

Fig. 2: A cell in the neutrino lattice. Bold lines mark the forces
between neutrinos and antineutrinos. Thin lines mark the forces
between either neutrinos only, or antineutrinos only.

A neutrino lattice takes care of the continuum of frequencies which must,
according to Fourier analysis, be present after the high energy collision which
created the particle. We will, for the sake of simplicity, ﬁrst set the sidelength
of the lattice at 10−13 cm that means approximately equal to the size of the
nucleon. The lattice then contains about 109 lattice points. The sidelength of
the lattice does not enter Eq.(23) for the frequencies of diatomic oscillations.
The calculation of the ratios of the masses is consequently independent of
the size of the lattice, as was the case with the γ-branch. The size of the
lattice can be explained with the pressure which the lattice oscillations exert
on a crossection of the lattice. The pressure cannot exceed Young’s modulus
of the lattice. We require that the lattice is isotropic.

From the frequency distribution of the axial diatomic oscillations (Eq.23),
shown in Fig. 3, follows the group velocity dω/dk = 2πa dν/dφ at each point
φ. With ν = ν0f (φ) and ν0 =

α/4π2M = c⋆/2πa as in Eq.(9) we ﬁnd

In order to determine the value of dω/dk we have to know the value of

From Eq.(8) for α follows that α = a c44 in the isotropic case with central
forces. The group velocity is therefore

cg =

a3c44/M · df /dφ .

In Eq.(24) we now set a
of light. It follows that

q

α/M = c⋆, as in Eq.(11), where c⋆ is the velocity

(25)

(26)

as it was with the γ-branch, only that now on account of the rest masses of the
neutrinos the group velocity must be smaller than c⋆, so the value of df/dφ

cg = c⋆ · df /dφ ,

22

∼= c⋆, which is a necessity because the neutrinos in
is limited to < 1, but cg
the lattice soon approach the velocity of light as we will see. Equation (26)
applies regardless whether we consider ν+ or ν− in Eq.(23). That means that
there are no separate transverse oscillations with their theoretically higher
frequencies.

⋆. It can be veriﬁed easily that m(νµ) = 50 meV/c2

The rest mass M of the heavy neutrino can be determined with lattice
theory from Eq.(25) as we have shown in [11]. This involves the inaccurately
known compression modulus of the proton. We will, therefore, rather deter-
mine the rest mass of the muon neutrino with Eq.(28), which leads to m(νµ)
≈ 50 milli-eV/c2
⋆ makes
sense. The energy of the rest mass of the π± mesons is 139 MeV, and we
have N/4 = 0.7135·109 muon neutrinos and the same number of anti-muon
neutrinos. It then follows that the energy in the rest masses of all muon and
anti-muon neutrinos is 71.35 MeV, that is 51% of the energy of the rest mass
of the π± mesons, m(π±)c2
⋆ goes, as
we will see, into the electron neutrino masses, the rest goes into the lattice
oscillations.

⋆ = 139.57 MeV. A small part of m(π±)c2

The energy in the rest mass of the π± mesons is the sum of the oscillation
energies plus the sum of the energy in the rest masses of the neutrinos. For
the sum of the energies of the frequencies we use Eq.(14) with the same N and
ν0 we used for the γ-branch. For the integral in Eq.(14) of the axial diatomic
frequencies corrected for the group velocity limitation we ﬁnd the value π2/2
as can be easily derived from the plot of the corrected frequencies in Fig. 3.
The value of the integral in Eq.(14) for the axial diatomic frequencies ν = ν0φ
is 1/2 of the value π2 of the same integral in the case of axial monatomic
frequencies, because in the latter case the increase of the corrected frequencies
continues to φ = π, whereas in the diatomic case the increase of the corrected
frequencies ends at π/2, see Fig. 3. We consider cg to be so close to c⋆ that
it does not change the value of the integral in Eq.(14) signiﬁcantly. It can
be calculated that the time average of the velocity of the electron neutrinos
in the π± mesons is ¯v = 0.99994c⋆, if m(νe) = 0.365 milli-eV/c2
⋆ as will be
shown in Eq.(34). Consequently we ﬁnd that the sum of the energies of the
corrected diatomic neutrino frequencies is 0.5433·10−4 erg = 33.91 MeV. We
double this amount because we deal with standing waves or the superposition
of two waves of the same energy and ﬁnd that the energy of the neutrino
oscillations in π± is

Eν(π±) = 67.82 MeV = 1/2 · Eν(π0) = 0.486 m(π±)c2
⋆.

(27)

23

In order to determine the sum of the rest masses of the neutrinos we make
use of Eν(π±) and obtain an approximate value of the rest mass of the muon
neutrino from

m(π±)c2

⋆ − Eν(π±) =

[m(νµ) + m(¯νµ) + m(νe) + m(¯νe)]c2

⋆ = 71.75 MeV .
(28)
If m(νe) ≪ m(νµ) and m(νµ) = m(¯νµ), as we will justify later, we arrive with
N/2 = 1.427·109 at

X

m(νµ) ≈ 50 milli-eV/c2
⋆.

The sum of the energy of the rest masses of all neutrinos Eq.(28) plus the
oscillation energy Eq.(27) gives the theoretical rest mass of the π± mesons
which is, since we used m(π±) in the determination of the neutrino rest
masses with Eq.(28), equal to the experimental rest mass of 139.57 MeV.

A cubic lattice and conservation of neutrino numbers during the reaction
γ + p → π+ + π− + p necessitates that the π+ and π− lattices contain
just as many electron neutrinos as anti-electron neutrinos.
If the lattice
is cubic it must have a center neutrino (Fig. 4). Conservation of neutrino
numbers requires furthermore that the center neutrino of, say, π+ is matched
by an antineutrino in π−.
In the decay sequence of (say) the π− meson
π− → µ− + ¯νµ and µ− → e− + νµ + ¯νe an electron neutrino does not appear.
But since (N - 1)/4 electron neutrinos νe must be in the π− lattice it follows
that (N - 1)/4 electron neutrinos must go with the electron emitted in the µ−
decay.

We must now be more speciﬁc about N, which is an odd number, because
a cubic lattice (Fig. 4) has a center particle, just as the NaCl lattice.
In
the π± mesons there are then (N - 1)/4 muon neutrinos νµ and the same
number of anti-muon neutrinos ¯νµ, as well as (N - 1)/4 electron neutrinos νe
and the same number of anti-electron neutrinos ¯νe, plus a center neutrino or
antineutrino. We replace N - 1 by N′. Since N′ diﬀers from N by only one in
109 we have N′ ∼= N. Although the numerical diﬀerence between N and N′ is
negligible we cannot consider any integer number N because that would mean
that there could be fractions of a neutrino. N′ is an even number, because
each cell (Fig. 2) of the lattice (Fig. 4) consists of four pairs of neutrinos.

The antiparticle of the π+ meson is the particle in which all frequencies of
the neutrino lattice oscillations have been replaced by frequencies with the
opposite sign, all neutrinos replaced by their antiparticles and the positive
charge replaced by the negative charge. If, as we will show, the antineutrinos
have the same rest mass as the neutrinos it follows that the antiparticle of the
π+ meson has the same mass as π+ but opposite charge, i.e. is the π− meson.
Now we turn to the K mesons. The primary decay of the K± mesons
K± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ) (63.5%) leads to the same end products as the π± meson
decay π± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ) (99.98%). From this and the decay of the µ mesons
we learn that the K mesons must, at least partially, be made of the same four
neutrino types as in the π± mesons namely of muon neutrinos, anti-muon
neutrinos, electron neutrinos and anti-electron neutrinos and their oscillation
energies. However the K± mesons with a mass of 0.88·4m(π±) cannot be
solely the second mode of the lattice oscillations of the π± mesons, because
the second mode of the π± mesons has an energy of 4Eν(π±) + N/2·(m(νµ)
+ m(νe)) c2
⋆ ≈ (271.3 + 71.75)MeV = 343 MeV. The 343 MeV characterize
the second or (2.) mode of the π± mesons, which fails m(K±)c2
⋆ = 493.7 MeV
by a wide margin.

e3, and K+ → π0 + µ+ + νµ (3.27%), called K+

The concept that the K± mesons are alone a higher mode of the π± mesons
also contradicts our point that the particles consist of the particles into which
they decay. The decays K± → π±+π0 (21.13%), as well as K+ → π0 + e++νe
(4.87%), called K+
µ3, make up
29.27% of the K± meson decays. A π0 meson ﬁgures in each of these decays.
If we add the energy in the rest mass of a π0 meson m(π0)c2
⋆ = 134.97 MeV
to the 343 MeV in the second mode of the π± mesons then we arrive at an
energy of 478 MeV, which is 96.8% of m(K±)c2
⋆. Therefore we conclude that
the K± mesons consist of the second mode of the π± mesons plus a π0 meson
or are the state (2.)π± + π0. Then it is natural that π0 mesons from the π0

25

component in the K± mesons are among the decay products of the K± mesons.
The average factor 0.85 ± 0.025 in the ratios of the masses of the particles
of the ν-branch to the mass of the π± mesons is a consequence of the neutrino
rest masses. They make it impossible that the ratios of the particle masses are
integer multiples because the particles consist of the energy in the neutrino
oscillations plus the neutrino rest masses which are independent of the order
of the lattice oscillations. Since the contribution in percent of the neutrino
rest masses to the ν-branch particle masses decreases with increased particle
mass the factor in front of the mass ratios of the ν-branch particles must
decrease with increased particle mass.

We obtain the K0 meson if we superpose onto the second mode of the
π± mesons instead of a π0 meson a basic mode of the π± mesons with a
charge opposite to the charge of the second mode of the π± meson. The
K0 and K0 mesons, or the state (2.)π± + π∓, is made of neutrinos and an-
tineutrinos only, without a photon component, because the second mode of
π± as well as the basic mode π∓ consist of neutrinos and antineutrinos only.
The K0 meson has a measured mean square charge radius hr2i = - 0.076 ±
0.021 fm2 according to [2], which can only be if there are two charges of oppo-
site sign within K0, as this model assumes. Since the mass of a π± meson is
⋆ larger than the mass of a π0 meson the mass of K0 should be
by 4.59 MeV/c2
larger than m(K±), and indeed m(K0) − m(K±) = 3.995 MeV/c2
⋆ according to
[2]. Similar diﬀerences occur with m(D±) − m(D0) and m(Ξ0
c ). The
S → π+ + π− (68.6%) creates directly the π+ and π− mesons which
decay K0
are part of the (2.)π± + π∓ structure of K0 we have suggested. The decay
S → π0 + π0 (31.4%) apparently originates from the 2γ branch of electron
K0
positron annihilation. Both decays account for 100% of the decays of K0
S.
L → 3π0 (21.1%) apparently comes from the 3γ branch of elec-

(27.18%) and K0
the K0
L decays apparently originate from the decay of the second mode of
the π± mesons in the K0 structure, either into µ∓ + νµ or into e∓ + νe. The
same types of decay, apparently tied to the (2.)π± mode, accompany also
the K± decays where, however, a π0 meson replaces the π± mesons in the
K0
L decay products. Our rule that the particles consist of the particles into
which they decay also holds for the K0 and K0 mesons. The explanation of
the K0,K0 mesons with the state (2.)π± + π∓ conﬁrms that the state (2.)π±
+ π0 was the correct choice for the explanation of the K± mesons. The state
(2.)π± + π∓ is also crucial for the explanation of the absence of spin of the

K0,K0 mesons, as we will see later.

The neutron with a mass ≈ 2m(K±) is either the superposition of a K+
and a K− meson or of a K0 meson and a K0 meson. As we will see, the
spin rules out a neutron consisting of a K+ and a K− meson. On the other
hand, the neutron can be the superposition of a K0 and a K0 meson. In this
case the neutron lattice contains at each lattice point a νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrino
quadrupole plus a superposition of the neutrino lattice oscillations and a
quadrupole of positive and negative electrical charges. The lattice oscillations
in the neutron must be coupled in order for the neutron to have spin 1/2,
just as the Λ baryon with spin 1/2 is a superposition of two η mesons. With
m(K0)(theor) = m(K±) + 4 MeV/c2 = 482 MeV/c2
⋆ from above it follows that
m(n)(theor) ≈ 2m(K0)(theor) ≈ 964 MeV/c2

⋆ = 1.026 m(n)(exp).

The proton does not decay and does not tell which particles it is made
of. However, we learn about the structure of the proton through the decay
of the neutron n → p + e− + ¯νe (100%). One single anti-electron neutrino
is emitted when the neutron decays and 1.293 MeV are released. But there
is no place for a permanent vacancy of a single missing neutrino and for a
small amount of permanently missing oscillation energy in a nuclear lattice.
As it appears all anti-electron neutrinos are removed from the structure of
the neutron in the neutron decay and converted into the kinetic energy of
the decay products. This type of process will be explained in the following
section. On the other hand, it is certain that the proton consists of a neutrino
lattice carrying a net positive electric charge. Actually, in our model the
proton contains three charges e+e−e+. The concept that the proton carries
just one electric charge has been abandoned a long time ago when it was said
that the proton consists of three quarks carrying fractional electric charges.
Each elementary charge in the proton has a magnetic moment, all of them
point in the same direction because the spin of the one e− must be opposite
to the spin of the two e+. Each magnetic moment of the elementary charges
has a g-factor ∼= 2. All three electric charges in the proton must then have a
g-factor ≈ 6, whereas the measured g(p) = 5.585 = 0.93·6.

The D± mesons with m(D±) = 0.9954·(m(p) + m(¯n)) are the superposi-
tion of a proton and an antineutron of opposite spin or of their antiparticles,
whereas the superposition of a proton and a neutron with the same spin
creates the deuteron with spin 1 and a mass m(d) = 0.9988·(m(p) + m(n)).
In this case the proton and neutron interact with the strong force, never-
theless the deuteron consists of a neutrino lattice with standing waves. The
D±
s mesons seem to be made of a body centered cubic lattice (Fig. 5) as dis-

27

cussed in [38].

Summing up: The characteristic feature of the ν-branch particles is the
cubic lattice consisting of νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos. The rest masses of the ν-
branch particles is the sum of the rest masses of the neutrinos and antineu-
trinos plus the mass in the energy of the lattice oscillations. The existence
of the neutrino lattice is a necessity if one wants to explain the spin, or the
absence of spin, of the ν-branch particles. We do not use hypothetical par-
ticles for the explanation of the ν-branch particles, just as we did not use
hypothetical particles for the explanation of the γ-branch particles.

7 The rest masses of the leptons

Surprisingly one can also explain the mass of the µ± mesons with the standing
wave model. The µ mesons belong to the lepton family which is distinguished
from the mesons and baryons by the absence of strong interaction with the
mesons and baryons. The charged leptons make up 1/2 of the number of
stable elementary particles. The standard model of the particles does not
deal with the lepton masses. Barut [39] has given a simple and quite accurate
empirical formula relating the masses of the electron, µ meson and τ meson,
which formula has been extended by Gsponer and Hurni [40] to the quark
masses.

The origin of most of the µ± mesons is the decay of the π± mesons, π±
→ µ± + νµ(¯νµ) or the decay of the K± mesons, K± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ). The
mass of the µ mesons is m(µ±) = 105.658 357 ± 5·10−6 MeV/c2
⋆, according

28

to the Review of Particle Physics [2]. The mass of the µ mesons is usually
compared to the mass of the electron and is often said to be m(µ) = m(e)(1
+ 3/2αf ) = 206.554 m(e), (αf being the ﬁne structure constant), whereas the
experimental value is 206.768 m(e). This formula for m(µ) was given by Barut
[41] following an earlier suggestion by Nambu [9] that m(µ) ≈ m(e)·3/2αf .
The µ mesons are “stable”, their lifetime τ (µ±) = 2.19703·10−6±4·10−11 sec,
is about a hundred times longer than the lifetime of the π± mesons, that
means longer than the lifetime of any other elementary particle, but for the
electrons, protons and neutrons.

Comparing the mass of the µ mesons to the mass of the π± mesons from
which the µ± mesons emerge we ﬁnd, with m(π±) = 139.570 18 MeV/c2
⋆,
that m(µ±)/m(π±) = 0.757027 = 1.00937 · 3/4 ∼= 3/4 + αf = 0.757297 =
1.00036 · m(µ±)/m(π±)(exp). The term + αf in the preceding equation will
be explained later, Eq.(65). The mass of the µ± mesons is in a good approx-
imation 3/4 of the mass of the π± mesons. We have also m(π±) − m(µ±) =
⋆ = 0.24297m(π±) or approximately 1/4 · m(π±). The mass
33.9118 MeV/c2
of the electron is approximately 1/207 of the mass of the muon, the contri-
bution of m(e±) to m(µ±) will therefore be neglected in the following. We
assume, as we have done before and as appears to be natural, that the parti-
cles, including the muons, consist of the particles into which they decay. The
µ± mesons decay via µ± → e± + ¯νµ(νµ) + νe(¯νe) (≈ 100%). The muons are
apparently composed of some of the neutrinos, antineutrinos and their os-
cillations which are, according to the standing wave model, present in the
cubic neutrino lattice of the π± mesons. The µ± mesons with a mass m(µ±)
∼= 3/4·m(π±) seem to be related to the π± mesons rather than to the electron
with which the µ± mesons have been compared traditionally, although m(µ±)
is separated from m(e±) by a factor ∼= 207.

From Eq.(28) followed that the rest mass of a muon neutrino should be
about 50 milli-eV/c2
⋆. Provided that the mass of an electron neutrino m(νe)
is small as compared to m(νµ), as will be shown by Eqs.(34,39), we ﬁnd, with
N = 2.854·109, that:

(a) The diﬀerence of the rest masses of the µ± and π± mesons is nearly
equal to the sum of the rest masses of all muon, respectively anti-muon,
neutrinos in the π± mesons.

m(π±) − m(µ±) = 33.912 MeV/c2
⋆

versus N′/4 · m(νµ) ≈ 35.68 MeV/c2
⋆ .

(b) The energy in the oscillations of all νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos in the

29

π± mesons is nearly the same as the energy in the oscillations of all ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe,
respectively νµ, νe, ¯νe, neutrinos in the µ± mesons. The oscillation energy is
the rest mass of a particle minus the sum of the rest masses of all neutrinos
in the particle as in Eq.(28). With m(νµ) = m(¯νµ) and m(νe) = m(¯νe) from
Eqs.(35,38) we have

Eν(π±) = m(π±)c2

⋆ − N′/2 · [m(νµ) + m(νe)]c2

⋆ = 68.22 MeV

(29)

versus

Eν(µ±) = m(µ±)c2

⋆ − N′/4 · m(νµ)c2

⋆ − N′/2 · m(νe)c2

⋆ = 69.98 MeV .

(30)

The latter equation means that either all N′/4 muon neutrinos or all N′/4
anti-muon neutrinos have been removed from the π± lattice in its decay.
We attribute the 1.768 MeV diﬀerence between the left and right side of (a)
to the second order eﬀects which cause the deviations of the masses of the
particles from the integer multiple rule. There is also the diﬀerence that
the left side of (a) deals with two charged particles, whereas the right side
deals with neutral particles. (b) seems to say that the oscillation energy of
all neutrinos in the π± lattice is conserved in the π± decay, which seems to
be necessary because the oscillation frequencies in π± and µ± must follow
Eq.(13) as dictated by the group velocity limitation. If indeed

Eν(π±) = Eν(µ±)

(31)

then it follows from the diﬀerence of Eqs.(29) and (30) that m(π±) − m(µ±)
= N′/4·m(νµ).

We should note that in the π± decays only one single muon neutrino
is emitted, not N′/4 of them, but that in the π± decay 33.912 MeV are
released. Since according to (b) the oscillation energy of the neutrinos in the
π± mesons is conserved in their decay the 33.9 MeV released in the π± decay
can come from no other source then from the rest masses of all muon or
all anti-muon neutrinos in the π± mesons. The energy in the rest masses of
these muon neutrinos is used to supply the kinetic energy in the momentum
of the single emitted muon neutrino (pc⋆ = 30 MeV) and in the momentum
of the emitted µ meson (pc⋆ = 4 MeV). The average kinetic energy of the
neutrinos in the π± lattice is about 50 milli-eV, so it is not possible for a single
neutrino in π± to possess an energy of 33.9 MeV. The 33.9 MeV can come
only from the sum of the muon neutrino rest masses. However, what happens

30

then to the neutrino numbers? Either conservation of neutrino numbers is
violated or the decay energy comes from equal numbers of muon and anti-
muon neutrinos. Equal numbers N′/8 muon and anti-muon neutrinos would
then be in the µ± mesons. This would not make a diﬀerence in either the
oscillation energy or in the sum of the rest masses of the neutrinos or in
the spin of the µ± mesons. The sum of the spin vectors of the N′/4 muon
or anti-muon neutrinos converted into kinetic energy is zero, as will become
clear in Section 11.

Inserting m(π±) − m(µ±) = N′/4·m(νµ) from (a) into Eq.(29) we arrive

at an equation for the theoretical value of the mass of the µ± mesons. It is

m(µ±)c2

⋆ = 1/2 · [ Eν(π±) + m(π±)c2

⋆ + N′ m(νe)c2

⋆/2 ] = 103.95 MeV ,

(32)

which expresses m(µ±) through the well-known mass of π±, the calculated
oscillation energy of π±, and a small contribution (0.4%) of the electron neu-
trino and anti-electron neutrino masses. Eq.(32) shows that our explanation
of the mass of the µ± mesons comes close to the experimental value m(µ±) =
⋆. With Eν(π±) = Eν(µ±) and with m(π±) from Eq.(28) we
105.658 MeV/c2
ﬁnd a diﬀerent form of equation (32) which is, in the case of the µ+ meson,

m(µ+) = Eν(µ±)/c2

⋆ + N′m(¯νµ)/4 + N′m(νe)/2 .

(33)

The ratio m(µ±)/m(π±) is 3/4, as it must be, if we divide Eq.(33) by m(π±)
which follows from Eq.(29) and if we neglect the masses of the electron and
anti-electron neutrinos.

The µ mesons cannot be point particles because they have a neutrino
lattice. The commonly held belief that the µ mesons are point particles is
based on the results of scattering experiments. But at a true point the density
of a “point particle” should be inﬁnite, which poses a problem. Since, on the
other hand, neutrinos do not interact, in a very good approximation, with
charge or mass it will not be possible to determine the size of the µ meson
lattice through conventional scattering experiments. The µ mesons appear to
be point particles because only the electrical charge of the muons participates
in the scattering process and the elementary electrical charge scatters like a
point particle.

Finally we must address the question for what reason do the muons or
leptons not interact strongly with the mesons and baryons? We have shown
in [8] that a strong force emanates from the sides of a cubic lattice caused by
the unsaturated weak forces of about 106 lattice points at the surface of the

31

lattice of the mesons and baryons. This follows from the study of Born and
Stern [42] which dealt with the forces between two parts of a cubic lattice
cleaved in vacuum.
If the muons have a lattice consisting of one type of
muon neutrinos, say, ¯νµ and of νe and ¯νe neutrinos their octahedronal lattice
surface is not the same as the surface of the cubic νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe lattice of the
mesons and baryons in the standing wave model. Therefore the muon lattice
does not bond with the cubic lattice of the mesons and baryons.

To summarize what we have learned about the µ± mesons. Eq.(33) says
that the energy in m(µ±)c2
⋆ is the sum of the oscillation energies plus the sum
of the energy of the rest masses of the neutrinos and antineutrinos in m(µ±),
neglecting the energy in e±. The three neutrino types in the µ± mesons
(Fig. 6) are the remains of the cubic neutrino lattice in the π± mesons. Since
all νµ respectively all ¯νµ neutrinos have been removed from the π± lattice in
the π± decay the rest mass of the µ± mesons must be ∼= 3/4·m(π±), in agree-
ment with the experimental results. The µ± mesons are not point particles.

of the µ+ meson.

The mass of the τ ± mesons follows from the most frequent decay of the

oscillation energies of the lattices in D±

32

follows that the energy in the rest mass of the τ ± mesons is the sum of the
oscillation energy in the τ meson lattice plus the sum of the energy of the
rest masses of all neutrinos and antineutrinos in the τ meson lattice, just as
with the µ± mesons. We will skip the details. The tau mesons are not point
particles either.

If the same principle that applies to the decay of the π± mesons, namely
that in the decay the oscillation energy of the decaying particle is conserved
and that an entire neutrino type supplies the energy released in the decay,
also applies to the decay of the neutron n → p + e− + ¯νe, then the mass of
the anti-electron neutrino can be determined from the known diﬀerence ∆ =
m(n) − m(p) = 1.293 332 MeV/c2
⋆ [2]. Nearly one half of ∆ comes from the
energy lost by the emission of the electron, whose mass is 0.510 9989 MeV/c2
⋆.
N anti-electron neutrinos are in the neutrino quadrupoles in the neutron, one-
fourth of them is carried away by the emitted electron. We have seen in the
paragraph below Eq.(28) that the decay sequence of the π± mesons requires
that the electron carries with it N′/4 electron neutrinos, if the π± mesons
consist of a lattice with a center neutrino or antineutrino and equal numbers
of νe, ¯νe, νµ, ¯νµ neutrinos as required by conservation of neutrino number dur-
ing the creation of π±. The electron can carry N′/4 anti-electron neutrinos
as well as N′/4 electron neutrinos. Since, as we will see shortly, m(νe) =
m(¯νe) this does not make a diﬀerence energetically but is relevant for the
orientation of the spin vector of the emitted electron. After the neutron has
lost N′/4 anti-electron neutrinos to the electron emitted in the β-decay the
other 3/4·N′ anti-electron neutrinos in the neutron provide the energy ∆ −
m(e−)c2
⋆ = 0.782 321 MeV released in the decay of the neutron. After division
by 3/4·N′ the rest mass of the anti-electron neutrino is

Since theoretically the antineutron decays as ¯n → ¯p + e+ + νe it follows from
the same considerations as with the decay of the neutron that

m(¯νe) = 0.365 meV/c2
⋆ .

m(νe) = m(¯νe) .

We note that

N′/4 · m(νe) = N′/4 · m(¯νe) = 0.51 m(e±) .

This equation is, as we will see, fundamental for the explanation of the mass
of the electron.

(34)

(35)

(36)

33

Inserting (34) into Eq.(28) we ﬁnd that

m(νµ) = 49.91 meV/c2
⋆ ,
Since the same considerations apply for either the π+ or the π− meson it
follows that

(37)

m(νµ) = m(¯νµ) .

(38)

Experimental values for the rest masses of the diﬀerent neutrino types are
not available. However, it appears that for the νµ ↔ νe oscillation the value
1 = 3.2×10−3 eV2 given on p.1565 of [35] can be used
for ∆m2 = m2
to determine m2 = m(νµ) if m1 = m(νe) is much smaller than m2. We have
then m(νµ) ≈ 56.56 milli-eV/c2
⋆, which is compatible with the value of m(νµ)
given in Eq.(37).

2 − m2

From Eqs.(34,37) follows that

m(νµ)/m(νe) = 136.74 ∼= 1/αf .
136.74 is 99.8% of the inverse of the ﬁne structure constant αf = e2/¯hc =
1/137.036. It does not seem likely that Eq.(39) is just a coincidence.

(39)

The mass of the τ neutrino ντ can be determined from the decay D±
s
→ τ ± + ντ (¯ντ ), and the subsequent decay τ ± → π± + ¯ντ (ντ ), which are
stated in [2]. The appearance of ντ in the decay of D±
s and the presence of
νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos in the π± decay product of the τ ± mesons means that
ντ , ¯ντ , νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos must be in the D±
s lattice. The additional ντ and
¯ντ neutrinos can be accomodated in the D±
s lattice by a body-centered cubic
lattice, in which there is in the center of each cubic cell one particle diﬀerent
from the particles in the eight cell corners (Fig. 5). In a body-centered cubic
lattice are N′/4 cell centers, if N′ is the number of lattice points without the
cell centers. If the particles in the cell centers are tau neutrinos then N′/8 ντ
and N′/8 ¯ντ neutrinos must be present, because of conservation of neutrino
numbers. From m(D±
⋆ follows
that

⋆ and m(τ ±) = 1777 MeV/c2

s ) = 1968.5 MeV/c2

m(D±

s ) − m(τ ±) = 191.5 MeV/c2

⋆ = N′/8 · m(ντ ) .

The rest mass of the τ neutrinos is therefore

m(ντ ) = m(¯ντ ) = 0.537 eV/c2
⋆ .

(40)

(41)

34

The ratio m(ντ )/m(νµ) = 10.76 of the neutrino masses given by Eq.(41) and
Eq.(37) is equal to 1.05·αw/αf , where αw is the weak coupling constant αw
= g2/4π¯hc = 1.02·10−5(mW /mp)2 [22] and αf is the ﬁne structure constant.
We keep in mind that g2 in αw is not nearly as accurately known as e2 in αf .
To summarize what we have learned about the masses of the leptons: We
have found an explanation for the mass of the µ± mesons and τ ± mesons. We
have also determined the rest masses of the e, µ, τ neutrinos and antineutri-
nos. In other words, we have found the masses of all leptons, exempting the
electron, which will be dealt with in the next Section.

8 The electron

The electron diﬀers from the other particles we have considered in so far
as it appears that its electrical charge cannot be separated from its mass,
whereas in the other charged particles the mass of the electric charge is, in a
ﬁrst approximation, unimportant for the mass of the particles. Even in the
muons the mass of the electron contributes only ﬁve thousandth of the muon
mass. On the other hand, the electron is fundamental for the stability of
the charged particles whose lifetime is sometimes orders of magnitude larger
than the lifetime of their neutral counterparts. For example the lifetime of
the π± mesons is eight orders of magnitude larger than the lifetime of π0, the
lifetime of the proton is inﬁnite, whereas the neutron decays in about 900
seconds and, as a startling example, the lifetime of Σ± is O(10−10) seconds,
whereas the lifetime of Σ0 is O(10−20) seconds. There is something particular
to the interaction of electrical charge with the particle masses.

After J.J. Thomson [43] discovered the small corpuscle which became
known as the electron an enormous amount of theoretical work has been
done to explain the existence of the electron. Some of the most distinguished
physicists have participated in this eﬀort. Lorentz [44], Poincar´e [45], Ehren-
fest [46], Einstein [47], Pauli [48], and others showed that it is fairly certain
that the electron cannot be explained as a purely electromagnetic particle.
In particular it was not clear how the elementary electrical charge could be
held together in its small volume because the internal parts of the charge
repel each other. Poincar´e [49] did not leave it at showing that such an
electron could not be stable, but suggested a solution for the problem by
introducing what has become known as the Poincar´e stresses whose origin
however remained unexplained. These studies were concerned with the static

35

properties of the electron, its mass m(e±) and its electric charge e. In order
to explain the electron with its existing mass and charge it appears to be
necessary to add to Maxwell’s equations a non-electromagnetic mass and a
non-electromagnetic force which could hold the electric charge together. We
shall see what this mass and force is.

The discovery of the spin of the electron by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit [50]
increased the diﬃculties of the problem in so far as it now had also to be ex-
plained how the angular momentum ¯h/2 and the magnetic momentum ∼= µB
come about. The spin of a point-like electron seemed to be explained by
Dirac’s [51] equation, however it turned out later [52] that Dirac type equa-
tions can be constructed for any value of the spin. Afterwards Schr¨odinger
[53] tried to explain the spin and the magnetic moment of the electron with
the so-called Zitterbewegung. Later on many other models of the electron
were proposed. On p.74 of his book “The Enigmatic Electron” Mac Gregor
[54] lists more than thirty such models. At the end none of these models has
been completely successful because the problem developed a seemingly insur-
mountable diﬃculty when it was shown through electron-electron scattering
experiments that the radius of the electron must be smaller than 10−16 cm,
in other words that the electron appears to be a point particle, at least by
three orders of magnitude smaller than the classical electron radius re =
2.8179·10−13 cm. This, of course, makes it very diﬃcult to explain how a
particle can have a ﬁnite angular momentum when the radius goes to zero,
and how an electric charge can be conﬁned in an inﬁnitesimally small vol-
ume. If the elementary electric charge would be in a volume with a radius
of O(10−16) cm the Coulomb self-energy would be orders of magnitude larger
than the rest mass of the electron, which is not realistic. The choice is be-
tween a massless point charge and a ﬁnite size particle with a non-interacting
mass to which an elementary electric charge is attached.

We propose in the following, as in [55], that the non-electromagnetic
mass which seems to be necessary in order to explain the electron consists
of neutrinos. This is actually a necessary consequence of our standing wave
model of the masses of the mesons and baryons. And we propose that the
non-electromagnetic force required to hold the electric charge and the neu-
trinos in the electron together is the weak nuclear force which, as we have
suggested, holds together the masses of the mesons and baryons and also
the mass of the muons. Since the range of the weak nuclear force is on the
order of 10−16 cm the neutrinos must be arranged in a lattice with the weak
force extending from each lattice point only to the nearest neighbors. The

36

O(10−13) cm size of the neutrino lattice in the electron does not at all con-
tradict the results of the scattering experiments, just as the explanation of
the mass of the muons with the standing wave model does not contradict the
apparent point particle characteristics of the muon, because neutrinos are in
a very good approximation non-interacting and therefore are not noticed in
scattering experiments with electrons.

The rest mass of the electron is m(e) = 0.510 998 902 ± 4·10−8 MeV/c2
⋆
and the electrostatic charge of the electron is e = 4.803 204 20·10−10 esu, as
stated in the Review of Particle Physics [2]. The objective of a theory of the
electron must, ﬁrst of all, be the explanation of m(e±) and e, but also of s(e±)
and of the magnetic moment µe. We will ﬁrst explain the rest mass of the
electron making use of what we have learned from the standing wave model,
in particular of what we have learned about the explanation of the mass of
the µ± mesons in Section 7. We will have to refer to this repeatedly. The
muons are leptons, just as the electrons, that means that they interact with
other particles exclusively through the electric force. The muons have a mass
which is 206.768 times larger than the mass of the electron, but they have the
same elementary electric charge as the electron or positron and the same spin.
Scattering experiments tell that the µ± mesons are point particles with a size
< 10−16 cm, just as the electron. In other words, the muons have the same
characteristics as the electrons and positrons but for a mass which is about
200 times larger. Consequently the muon is often referred to as a “heavy”
electron. If a non-electromagnetic mass is required to explain the mass of the
electron then a non-electromagnetic mass 200 times as large as in the electron
is required to explain the mass of the muons. These non-electromagnetic
masses must be non-interacting, otherwise scattering experiments could not
ﬁnd the size of either the electron or the muon at 10−16 cm.

We have explained the mass of the muons with the standing wave model in
Section 7. According to our model the muons consist of an elementary electric
charge and an oscillating lattice of neutrinos which, as we know, do not
interact with mass. Neutrinos are the only non-interacting matter we know
of. In the muon lattice are, according to our model, (N - 1)/4 = N′/4 muon
neutrinos νµ (respectively anti-muon neutrinos ¯νµ), N′/4 electron neutrinos νe
and the same number of anti-electron neutrinos ¯νe, one elementary electric
charge and the energy of the lattice oscillations. The letter N stands for
the number of all neutrinos and antineutrinos in the cubic lattice of the π±
mesons, N = 2.854·109, Eq.(15). It is, as explained in Section 7, a necessary
consequence of the decay of, say, the µ− muon µ− → e− + ¯νe + νµ that there

37

must be N′/4 electron neutrinos νe in the emitted electron. For the mass
of the electron neutrinos and anti-electron neutrinos we found in Eq.(34)
that m(νe) = m(¯νe) = 0.365 milli-eV/c2
⋆. The sum of the energies in the rest
masses of the N′/4 neutrinos or antineutrinos in the lattice of the electron or
positron is then

m(νe)c2

⋆ = N′/4 · m(νe)c2

⋆ = 0.260 43 MeV = 0.51 m(e±)c2
⋆ .

The explanation of the π± mesons led to the explanation of the µ± mesons
and now leads to the explanation of e±. The explanation of π± and µ±
requires that 1/2 of the rest mass of the electron or positron consists of
electron neutrinos or anti-electron neutrinos.

The other half of the rest mass of the electron must originate from the
energy in the electric charge carried by the electron. From pair production
γ + M → e− + e+ + M, (M being any nucleus), and from conservation
of neutrino numbers follows necessarily that there must also be a neutrino
lattice composed of N′/4 anti-electron neutrinos, which make up the lattice
of the positrons, which lattice has, since m(νe) = m(¯νe), the same rest mass
as the neutrino lattice of the electron, as it must be for the antiparticle of
the electron.

Fourier analysis dictates that a continuum of high frequencies must be in
the electrons or positrons created by pair production in a timespan of 10−23
seconds. We will now determine the energy Eν(e±) in the oscillations in the
interior of the electron. Since we want to explain the rest mass of the electron
we can only consider the frequencies of non-progressive waves. The sum of
the energies of the lattice oscillations is, in the case of the π± mesons, given
by

Eν(π±) =

hν0N
2π(ehν/kT − 1)

π

φdφ .

(43)

This is Eq.(14) combined with Eq.(16) which were used to determine the
oscillation energy in the π0 and π± mesons. This equation was introduced
by Born and v. Karman [13] in order to explain the internal energy of cubic
crystals. If we apply Eq.(43) to the oscillations in the electron which has N′/4
electron neutrinos νe we arrive at Eν(e±) = 1/4·Eν(π±), which is mistaken
⋆/2 and m(π±) = 273 m(e±). Eq.(43) must be
because Eν(π±) ≈ m(π±)c2

38

(44)

(45)

modiﬁed in order to be suitable for the oscillations in the electron. It turns
out that we must use

Eν(e±) =

hν0N · αf
2π(ehν/kT − 1)

π

Z
−π

φdφ ,

where αf is the ﬁne structure constant. The appearance of αf in Eq.(44)
means that the nature of the oscillations in the electron is diﬀerent from the
oscillations in the π0 or π± lattices. With αf = e2/¯hc⋆ and ν0 = c⋆/2πa we
have

hν0αf = e2/a ,

which shows that the oscillations in the electron are electric oscillations. As
is well-known the ﬁne structure constant αf characterizes the strength of the
electromagnetic forces.

There must be N′/2 oscillations of the elements of the electric charge in e±,
because we deal with non-progressive waves, either standing waves or circular
oscillations. As we will see later the spin requires that the oscillations are
circular. That means that 2×N′/4 ∼= N/2 oscillations are in Eq.(44). From
Eqs.(43,44) then follows that

Eν(e±) = αf /2 · Eν(π±) .
(46)
Eν(π±) is the oscillation energy in the π± mesons which can be calculated
with Eq.(43). According to Eq.(27) it is

Eν(π±) = 67.82 MeV = 0.486 m(π±)c2

⋆ ≈ m(π±)c2

⋆/2 .

(47)

With Eν(π±) ≈ m(π±)c2
Eq.(46) that the oscillation energy of the electron or positron is

⋆/2 = 139.57/2 MeV and αf = 1/137.036 follows from

Eν(e±) =

m(π±)c2

= 0.254 623 MeV = 0.996 570 m(e±)c2

⋆/2 .

(48)

If we replace in Eq.(48) the experimental value for m(π±) by the good em-
pirical approximation m(π±) ∼= m(e±)(2/αf ), Eq.(63), then it follows that
Eν(e±) = 1/2·m(e±)c2
⋆. In other words, the oscillation energy makes up 1/2
of the energy in the rest mass of the electron.

In Eq.(48) we have determined the value of the oscillation energy in e±
from the product of the very accurately known ﬁne structure constant and

39

the very accurately known rest mass of the π± mesons which establishes a
ﬁrm value of the oscillation energy of e±. The other half of the energy in
m(e±) is in the rest masses of the neutrinos in the electron. We can conﬁrm
Eq.(48) without using Eν(π±) with the formula for the oscillation energy
Eq.(44) in the form of Eq.(52) with N/2 = 1.427·109, e = 4.803·10−10 esu, a
= 1·10−16 cm, f(T) = 1/1.305·1013 and, with the integral being π2, we obtain
Eν(e±) = 0.968 m(e±)c2
⋆/2. This calculation involves more parameters than
in Eq.(48) and is consequently less accurate than Eq.(48).

In a good approximation the oscillation energy of e± in Eq.(48) is equal
to the sum of the energies in the rest masses of the electron neutrinos in the
e± lattice in Eq.(42). Since

m(e±)c2

⋆ = Eν(e±) +

m(νe)c2

⋆ = Eν(e±) + N′/4 · m(νe)c2
⋆ ,

(49)

it follows with Eqs.(42) and (48) that

X

m(e±)c2

⋆(theor) = 0.5151 MeV = 1.0079 m(e±)c2

⋆(exp) .

(50)

The theoretical rest mass of the electron or positron agrees within the accu-
racy of the parameters N and m(νe) with the measured rest mass.

From Eq.(46) follows with Eν(π±) ∼= m(π±)c2

⋆/2 from Eq.(47) that

2Eν(e±)= αf Eν(π±) = αf m(π±)c2

⋆/2 ∼= m(e±)c2
⋆ ,

or that

m(e±) · 2/αf = 274.072 m(e±) ∼= m(π±) ,
whereas the actual ratio of the mass of the π± mesons to the mass of the elec-
tron is m(π±)/m(e±) = 273.132 or 0.9965·2/αf . We have here the same ratio
m(π±)/m(e±) which we ﬁnd with the standing wave model of the π± mesons,
Eq.(63). This seems to be a necessary condition for the validity of our model
of the electron.

(51)

We have thus shown that the rest mass of the electron can be explained
by the sum of the rest masses of the electron neutrinos in a cubic lattice
with N′/4 electron neutrinos νe plus the mass in the sum of the energy of
N/2 standing electric oscillations in the lattice. The one oscillation added
to the even numbered N′/4 oscillations is the oscillation at the center of the
lattice, Fig. 7. From this model follows, since it deals with a cubic neutrino
lattice, that the electron is not a point particle. However, since neutrinos

40

the electron lattice.

are non-interacting their presence will not be detected in electron-electron
scattering experiments.

The size of the electron determined by electron-electron scattering at
< 10−16 cm seems to contradict the model of the electron proposed here.
However, this experimental size does not apply to the circumstances consid-
ered here. One has to ﬁnd the scattering formula for ﬁnite size charged cubic
lattices and analyze the experimental data with such a scattering formula in
order to see whether our model is in contradiction to the experiments. If the
electron lattice behaves like a rigid body then electron-electron scattering
should take place at the center of the lattice, which is a point [54].

Let us compare the rest mass of the electron to the rest mass of the
muon, which was explained in Section 7 with an oscillating lattice of muon
and electron neutrinos and an elementary electric charge. The electron has
the most simple neutrino lattice, consisting of only one neutrino type, ei-
ther electron neutrinos or anti-electron neutrinos, and it has the smallest
sum of the rest masses of the neutrinos in a particle. The heavy weight
of the muon m(µ±) = 206.768·m(e±) is a consequence of the heavy weight
of the N′/4 muon neutrinos or N′/4 anti-muon neutrinos in the muon lat-
tice. The mass of either a muon neutrino or an anti-muon neutrino is 137
times the mass of an electron or anti-electron neutrino, Eq.(39). That makes

41

the electron neutrinos and anti-electron neutrinos in µ± as well as the mass
of the electric charge in a ﬁrst approximation negligible.
It then follows
from Eq.(60) that m(µ±)(theor) ∼= 3/2·m(νµ)/m(νe)·m(e±) = 205.11·m(e±)
= 0.99198·m(µ±)(exp), which proves that the heavy mass of the muons is
caused by the heavy muon neutrinos.

We must now explain how the electric charge of the electron is “attached”
to the neutrino lattice. We recall that Fourier analysis requires that, after
pair production, there must be a continuum of frequencies in the electron or
positron. With hν0Nαf = Ne2/a it follows from Eq.(44) that the oscillation
energy in e± is the sum of 2×(N′/4 + 1) ∼= N/2 electric oscillations

Eν(e±) =

(52)

with f(T) = 1/(ehν/kT − 1). From the factor e2/a in Eq.(52) follows that the
oscillation energy is the same for electrons and positrons, as it must be. The
energy of the individual oscillations is e2f(T)φn/a where φn = 2πa/λn (as
in Eq.(6)), and a is the lattice constant. The wavelengths λn are quantized
because they belong to standing waves that ﬁt a ﬁnite volume; the continuum
of frequencies Fourier analysis predicts cannot be maintained in a particle of
ﬁnite size. It must be that λn = n a with the integer number n. The shortest
wavelength is at φn = π with λmin = 2a. The wavelength at the center of the
lattice with index 0 can, of course, not be inﬁnite but is the largest possible
wavelength in the lattice which is 2d, where d is the sidelength of the lattice.
The oscillation energy of the nth wavelength is given by

Eν(n) = 2πe2/na · f (T )

(0 < n ≤ 3
q

N/4) .

(53)

In the electron (Fig. 7) are N/2 oscillations or circular oscillations of one
sign only, otherwise the charge of all electric oscillations could not be either
the negative or positive elementary charge. The number of electric oscilla-
tions is 2×(N′/4 + 1) ∼= N/2 because we deal with non-progressive waves
which are the superposition of two waves of equal frequencies and ampli-
tudes. The necessity of the N/2 oscillations follows from Eq.(46) which must
have the factor αf /2, not αf /4, in order to arrive at the correct value of the
electron mass.

According to Gauss’ law

~E · d~A = Q/ǫ0 ,

I

42

(54)

the charge of the electron is contained in the electric oscillations. That
means that the elementary electric charge is not concentrated in a point,
but is distributed over N′/4 + 1 = O(109) charge elements eli. The charge
elements are distributed in a cubic lattice, and the resulting electric ﬁeld is
cubic, not spherical. For distances large as compared to the sidelength of
the cube, (which is O(10−13) cm), say at the ﬁrst Bohr radius which is on
the order of 10−8 cm, the deviation of the cubic ﬁeld from the spherical ﬁeld
will be reduced by about 10−10. The charge elements are characterized by
e2/a, they are conﬁned in a volume with radius a, where a is the range of
the weak nuclear force which is on the order of 10−16 cm. The elementary
electric charge is the sum of the charge elements

e =

eli

Xi

(0 ≤ i ≤ N′/4 + 1) .

(55)

Instead of an inﬁnite number of inﬁnitesimally small charge elements which
repel each other and cause the sum of the charge elements to explode, as
in the classical electron models, we have a ﬁnite number of charge elements,
because the range of the weak nuclear force which holds the charge together
is limited to 10−16 cm. Each of the circular electric oscillations carries the
same charge

eli = e/(N′/4 + 1) .

(56)

Using Gauss’ law (54) it follows from Eq.(56) that the charge in a cubic
lattice with N′/4 + 1 charge elements eli is equal to the elementary electrical
charge, as it must be.

Each element of the charge distribution is surrounded in the horizontal
plane by four electron neutrinos as in Fig. 7, and in vertical direction by an
electron neutrino above and also below the element. The electron neutrinos
hold the charge elements in place. We must assume that the charge elements
are bound to the neutrinos by the weak nuclear force. The weak nuclear force
plays here a role similar to its role in holding, for example, the π± lattice
together. It is not possible, in the absence of a deﬁnitive explanation of the
neutrinos, to give an explanation for the electro-weak interaction between the
electric oscillations and the neutrinos. However, the presence of the range a
of the weak nuclear force in e2/a is a sign that the weak force is involved in the
electric oscillations. The attraction of the charge elements by the neutrinos
overcomes the Coulomb repulsion of the charge elements. The weak nuclear
force is the missing non-electromagnetic force or the Poincar´e stress which

43

holds the elementary electric charge together. The same considerations apply
for the positive electric charge of the positron, only that then the electric
oscillations are all of the positive sign and that they are bound to anti-
electron neutrinos.

Finally we learn that Eq.(52) precludes the possibility that the charge of
the electron sits only on its surface. The number N in Eq.(52) would then be
on the order of 106, whereas N must be on the order of 109 so that Eν(e±)
can be m(e±)c2
⋆/2 as is necessary. In other words, the charge of the electron
must be distributed throughout the interior of the electron, as we assumed.
Summing up: The rest mass of the electron and positron originates from
the sum of the rest masses of N′/4 electron neutrinos or anti-electron neutri-
nos in cubic lattices plus the mass in the energy of the electric oscillations
in their neutrino lattices. The neutrinos, as well as the electric oscillations,
make up 1/2 of the rest mass of e± each. The circular electric oscillations are
attached to the neutrinos by the weak nuclear force. The sum of the charge
elements of the electric oscillations accounts for the elementary charge of the
electron, respectively positron. The electron or the positron are not point
particles.

One hundred years of sophisticated theoretical work have made it abun-
dantly clear that the electron is not a purely electromagnetic particle. There
must be something else in the electron but electric charge. It is equally clear
from the most advanced experimental work that the “something else” in the
electron must be non-interacting, otherwise it could not be that the scatter-
ing experiments ﬁnd that the radius of the electron must be smaller than
10−16 cm. The only non-interacting matter we know of with certainty are the
neutrinos. So it seems to be natural to ask whether neutrinos are not part of
the electron. Actually we have not introduced the neutrinos in an axiomatic
manner but rather as a consequence of our standing wave model of the stable
mesons, baryons and µ mesons. It follows necessarily from this model that
after the decay of, say, the µ− meson there must be electron neutrinos in the
emitted electron, and that they make up one half of the rest mass of the
electron. Working with this ﬁnding we have explained the rest mass of the
electron which agrees, within 1% accuracy, with the experimental value of
m(e±). We have learned that the charge of the electron is not concentrated
in a single point, but rather is distributed over O(109) elements which are
held together with the neutrinos by the weak nuclear force. There is, in this
model, no alternative to this conclusion. From the explanation of the mass
and charge follows, as we will show, the correct spin and magnetic moment

44

of the electron, the other two fundamental features of the electron. With a
cubic lattice of anti-electron neutrinos we also arrive with the same consid-
erations as above at the correct mass, charge, spin and magnetic moment of
the positron.

9 The ratios m(µ±)/m(e±), m(π±)/m(e±)

and m(p)/m(e)

We can now explain the ratios m(µ±)/m(e±), m(π±)/m(e±) and m(p)/m(e).
We modify Eq.(36) by setting N′/4·m(νe) = 0.5 m(e±), not at 0.51 m(e±). In
other words we say that 1/2 of the mass of the electron is made of neutrinos.
If the other half of the mass of the electron originates from the electric charge
of the electron, as we have shown in the preceding Section, then the mass of
the electron is twice the mass of the sum of the rest masses of the neutrinos
in the electron (Eq.36) and we have

m(e±) = N′/2 · m(νe)

or N′/2 · m(¯νe) .

We also set Eν(π±) = 0.5 m(π±)c2
With Eν(π±) = Eν(µ±) from Eq.(31) it follows with Eq.(29) and m(π±)c2
2 Eν(π±) that

⋆ as in Eq.(27).
⋆ =

Eν(µ±) = N′/2 · [m(νµ) + m(νe)]c2
⋆ .

From Eq.(33) then follows that

m(µ±) = 3/4 · N′m(νµ) + N′m(νe) ,

and with m(e±) = N′/2·m(νe) from Eq.(57) we have

m(µ±)

which is 1.0038 times the real ratio 206.768. In order to arrive at the proper
ratio of m(µ±)/m(e±) the ratio of the neutrino masses must be m(νµ)/m(νe)

The mass of the muon is, according to Eq.(60), much larger than the mass
of the electron because the mass of the muon neutrino is much larger, m(νµ)
∼= 137 m(νe), than the mass of the electron neutrino. The ratio of the mass
of the muon to the mass of the electron is independent of the number N′ of
the neutrinos of either type in both lattices. Barut’s [41] empirical formula
for the mass ratio is

m(µ±)/m(e±) = 3/2αf + 1 = 206.55 ,

(62)

whereas the actual ratio is 206.768 = 1.0010·206.55. A much better approx-
imation to the experimental mass ratio is obtained when the + 1 in Barut’s
formula is replaced by + 1.25. The thus calculated m(µ±)/m(e±) = 206.804
diﬀers then from the measured m(µ±)/m(e±) by the factor 1.00017.

Similarly we obtain

which is 1.0108 times the real ratio 273.132. The empirical formula of this
mass ratio is m(π±)/m(e±) = 2/αf − 1 = 273.07 which is 0.99977 times the
experimental ratio 273.132.

A better relation between the mass of the muon and the mass of the pion
can now be established. According to the third paragraph of Section 7 it is,
empirically,

m(µ±)/m(π±) = 3/4 + αf .
With αf Eν(π±) = 2Eν(e±), Eq.(46), and m(π±)c2
m(e±)c2

⋆ = 2Eν(e±), it follows that

(64)
⋆ = 2Eν(π±), as well as

m(µ±) = 3/4 · m(π±) + 2 m(e±) .

(65)

The right hand side of Eq.(65) is 1.00039 times larger than the experimental
value of m(µ±). The reason for the additional term 2m(e±) on the right hand
side of Eq.(65) has still to be found.

In order to determine m(n)/m(e±) we start with K0 = (2.)π± + π∓ and
⋆. Then m(K0) = 7N′/2·[m(νµ)

(2.)π± = 4Eν(π±) + N′/2·[m(νµ) + m(νe)]c2
+ m(νe)], and with m(n) = m(K0 + K0) = 2m(K0) it follows that

If our explanation of the masses of the mesons and baryons as well as
our explanation of the mass of the electron are correct then the ratios of the
masses of the mesons and baryons to the mass of the electron must agree with
the experimentally established mass ratios. We have found that the leading
term in the mass ratios, namely the term given by the ratio 1/αf of the mass
of the muon neutrino to the mass of the electron neutrino is, in our model,
the same as in the empirical formulas for the mass ratios. On the other
hand, there are diﬀerences on the right hand side of Eqs.(61,63) in the small
second term of the mass ratios as compared to the same term in the empirical
formulas for the mass ratios. The second term deals with the ratios of the
number of the electron neutrinos in the mesons and baryons to the number
of the electron neutrinos in the electron. We have remedied these diﬀerences
with the small modiﬁcation of the oscillation energy of the electron. The mass
ratios m(µ±)/m(e±) and m(π±)/m(e±) then agree with the experimental
mass ratios to the fourth decimal. The mass ratio of the proton to the
electron cannot be remedied by the modiﬁcation of the oscillation energy
of the electron, because the diﬀerence between calculated and experimental
mass ratios is primarily caused by the 2.6 % excess of the theoretical rest
mass of the K0 mesons.

10 The spin of the γ-branch particles

It appears to be crucial for the validity of a model of the elementary particles
that the model can also explain the spin of the particles without additional
assumptions. The spin or the intrinsic angular momentum is, after the mass,
the second most important property of the elementary particles. The stan-
dard model does not explain the spin, the spin is imposed on the quarks.
As is well-known the spin of the electron was discovered by Uhlenbeck and
Goudsmit [50] more than 75 years ago. Later on it was established that the

48

baryons have spin as well, but not the mesons. We have proposed an expla-
nation of the spin of the particles in [56]. For current eﬀorts to understand
the spin of the nucleon see Jaﬀe [57] and of the spin structure of the Λ baryon
see G¨ockeler et al. [58]. Rivas has described his own model of the spin and
other spin models in his book [59]. The explanation of the spin requires an
unambiguous answer, the spin must be 0 or 1/2 or integer multiples thereof,
nothing else.

The explanation of the spin of the particles seems to be inseparable from
the explanation of the structure of the particles. The spin of the particles is,
of course, the sum of the angular momentum vectors of the oscillations in the
particles, plus the sum of the spin vectors of the neutrinos and antineutrinos,
plus the spin of the electric charges in the mesons and baryons. It is striking
that the particles which, according to the standing wave model, consist of a
single oscillation mode do not have spin, as the π0, π± and η mesons do, see
Tables 1 and 2. It is also striking that particles whose mass is approximately
twice the mass of a smaller particle have spin 1/2 as is the case with the Λ
baryon, m(Λ) ≈ 2m(η), and with the nucleon m(n) ≈ 2m(K±) ≈ 2m(K0).
The Ξ0
c baryon which is a doublet of one mode has also spin 1/2. Composite
particles which consist of a doublet of one mode plus one or two other single
modes have spin 1/2, as the Σ0, Ξ0 and Λ+
c baryons do. The only
particle which seems to be the triplet of a single mode, the Ω− baryon with
m(Ω−) ≈ 3m(η), has spin 3/2. It appears that the relation between the spin
and the oscillation modes of the particles is straightforward.

In the standing wave model the π0 and η mesons consist of N = 2.85·109
standing electromagnetic waves, each with its own frequency. Their oscilla-
tions are longitudinal. The longitudinal oscillations of frequency νi in the π0
and η mesons do not have angular momentum or
i j(νi) = 0, with the in-
dex running from 0 to N. Longitudinal oscillations cannot cause an intrinsic
angular momentum because for longitudinal oscillations ~r × ~p = 0.

P

Each of the standing electromagnetic waves in the π0 and η mesons may,
on the other hand, have spin s = 1 of its own, because circularly polarized
electromagnetic waves have an angular momentum as was ﬁrst suggested
by Poynting [60] and veriﬁed by, among others, Allen [61]. The creation of
the π0 meson in the reaction γ + p → π0 + p and conservation of angular
momentum dictates that the sum of the angular momentum vectors of the N
electromagnetic waves in the π0 meson is zero,
i j(si) = 0. Either the sum of
the spin vectors of the electromagnetic waves in the π0 meson is zero, or each
electromagnetic wave in the π0 meson has zero spin which would mean that

P

49

they are linearly polarized. Linearly polarized electromagnetic waves are not
expected to have angular momentum. That this is actually so was proven
by Allen [61]. Since the longitudinal oscillations in the π0 and η mesons do
not have angular momentum and since the sum of the spin vectors si of the
electromagnetic waves is zero, the intrinsic angular momentum of the π0 and
η mesons is zero, or

j(π0, η) =

j(νi) +

j(si) = 0 (0 ≤ i ≤ N) .

(75)

In the standing wave model the π0 and η mesons do not have an intrinsic
angular momentum or spin, as it must be.

We now consider particles such as the Λ baryon which consist of super-
positions of two oscillations of equal amplitudes and of frequencies ω and
− ω, |− ω| = ω, at each of the N points of the lattice. The oscillations in
the particles must be coupled what we have marked in Tables 1,2 by the ∗
sign. The particles contain then N circular oscillations, each with its own
frequency and each having an angular momentum of ¯h/2 as we will see.

The superposition of two perpendicular linearly polarized traveling waves
of equal amplitudes and frequencies shifted in phase by π/2 leads to a cir-
cular wave with the constant angular momentum j = ¯h. The total energy
of a traveling wave is the sum of the potential and the kinetic energy. In
a traveling wave the kinetic energy is always equal to the potential energy.
From

with the moment of inertia Θ. It follows that the angular momentum j is

j = Θω = ¯h .

(76)

(78)

This applies to a traveling wave and corresponds to spin s = 1, or to a
circularly polarized photon.

We now add to one monochromatic circular oscillation with frequency ω
a second circular oscillation with − ω of the same absolute value as ω but
shifted in phase by π, having the same amplitude, as we have done in [56].

Negative frequencies are permitted solutions of the equations for the lattice
oscillations, Eq.(7). In other words we consider the circular oscillations

x(t) = exp[iωt] + exp[− i(ωt + π)] ,

y(t) = exp[i(ωt + π/2)] + exp[− i(ωt + 3π/2)] .

This can also be written as

x(t) = exp[iωt] − exp[−iωt] ,

y(t) = i · (exp[iωt] + exp[−iωt]) .

If we replace i in the Eqs. above by − i we have a circular oscillation turning
in opposite direction. The energy of the superposition of the two oscillations
is the sum of the energies of both individual oscillations, and since in circular
oscillations Ekin = Epot we have with Eq.(77)

4Ekin = 4Θω2/2 = Etot = ¯hω ,

from which follows that the circular oscillation has an angular momentum

j = Θω = ¯h/2 .

The superposition of two circular monochromatic oscillations of equal ampli-
tudes and frequencies ω and − ω satisﬁes the necessary condition for spin
s = 1/2 that the angular momentum is j = ¯h/2.

The standing wave model treats the Λ baryon, which has spin s = 1/2 and
a mass m(Λ) = 1.0190 · 2m(η), as the superposition of two particles of the
same type with N standing electromagnetic waves. The waves are circular
because they are the superposition of two waves with the same absolute
value of the frequency and the same amplitude. The angular momentum
vectors of all circular waves in the lattice cancel, except for the wave at
the center of the crystal. Each oscillation with frequency ω at φ > 0 has
at its mirror position φ < 0 a wave with the frequency − ω, which has a
negative angular momentum since j = mr2ω and ω = ω0φ. Consequently the
angular momentum vectors of both waves cancel. The center of the lattice
oscillates, as all other lattice points do, but with the frequency ν(0) which is
determined by the longest possible wavelength, which is twice the sidelength

51

d of the lattice, so ν(0) = c/2d. As the other circular waves in the lattice
the circular wave at the center has the angular momentum ¯h/2 according
to Eq.(84). The angular momentum of the center wave is the only angular
momentum which is not canceled by an oscillation of opposite circulation.

Consequently the net angular momentum of the N circular oscillations in
the lattice which are superpositions of two oscillations reduces to the angular
momentum of the center oscillation and is ¯h/2. Since the circular oscillations
in the Λ baryon are the only possible contribution to an angular momentum
the intrinsic angular momentum of the Λ baryon is ¯h/2 or

j(Λ) =

j(ωi) = j(ω0) = ¯h/2 .

(85)

Xi

We have thus explained that the Λ and likewise the Ξ0
c baryon satisfy the
necessary condition that j = ¯h/2 for s = 1/2. The intrinsic angular momen-
tum of the Λ baryon is the consequence of the superposition of two circular
oscillations of the same amplitude and the same absolute value of the fre-
quency. Spin 1/2 is caused by the composition of the particles, its not a
contributor to the mass of a particle.

The other particles of the γ-branch, the Σ0, Ξ0, Λ+

c baryons
are composites of a baryon with spin 1/2 plus one or two π mesons which do
not have spin. Consequently the spin of these particles is 1/2. The spin of
all particles of the γ-branch, exempting the spin of the Ω− baryon, has thus
been explained. For an explanation of s(Σ±,0) = 1/2 and of s(Ξ−,0) = 1/2,
regardless whether the particles are charged or neutral, we refer to [56].

11 The spin of the particles of the ν-branch

The characteristic particles of the neutrino-branch are the π± mesons which
have zero spin. At ﬁrst glance it seems to be odd that the π± mesons do not
have spin, because it seems that the π± mesons should have spin 1/2 from
the spin of the charges e± in π±. What happens to the spin of e± in π±?
The solution of this puzzle is in the composition of the π± mesons which are,
according to the standing wave model, made of a lattice of neutrinos and
antineutrinos (Fig. 2) each having spin 1/2, the lattice oscillations, and an
elementary electrical charge.

The longitudinal oscillations in the neutrino lattice of the π± mesons do
i j(νi) = 0, as it was with the π0 meson.

not cause an angular momentum,

P

52

In the cubic lattice of N = O(109) neutrinos and antineutrinos of the π± me-
sons the spin of nearly all neutrinos and antineutrinos must cancel because
conservation of angular momentum during the creation of the particle re-
quires that the total angular momentum around a central axis is ¯h/2.
In
fact the spin vectors of all but the neutrino or antineutrino in the center of
the lattice cancel. In order for this to be so the spin vector of any particular
neutrino in the lattice has to be opposite to the spin vector of the neutrino
at its mirror position. As is well-known only left-handed neutrinos and right-
handed antineutrinos exist. From ν = ν0φ (Eq.13) follows that the direction
of motion of the neutrinos in e.g. the upper right quadrant (φ > 0) is opposite
to the direction of motion in the lower left quadrant (φ < 0). Consequently
the spin vectors of all neutrinos or antineutrinos in opposite quadrants are
opposite and cancel. The only angular momentum remaining from the spin
of the neutrinos of the lattice is the angular momentum of the neutrino or
antineutrino at the center of the lattice which does not have a mirror parti-
cle. Consequently the electrically neutral neutrino lattice consisting of N′/2
neutrinos and N′/2 antineutrinos and the center particle, each with spin j(ni)
= 1/2, has an intrinsic angular momentum j =

i j(ni) = j(n0) = ¯h/2.

But electrons or positrons added to the neutral neutrino lattice have
likewise spin 1/2. If the spin of the electron or positron added to the neutrino
lattice is opposite to the spin of the neutrino or antineutrino in the center of
the lattice then the net spin of the π+ or π− mesons is zero, or

P

j(π±) =

j(νi)+

j(ni)+j(e±) = j(n0)+j(e±) = 0

(0 ≤ i ≤ N) . (86)

It is important for the understanding of the structure of the π± mesons to
realize that s(π±) = 0 can only be explained if the π± mesons consist of
a neutrino lattice to which an electron or positron is added whose spin is
opposite to the net spin of the neutrino lattice. Spin 1/2 of the elementary
electric charge can only be canceled by something that has also spin 1/2, and
the only conventional choice for that is a single neutrino.

The spin, the mass and the decay of π± require that the π± mesons are

made of a neutrino lattice and an electrical charge e±.

The spin of the K± mesons is zero. With the spin of the K± mesons
we encounter the same oddity we have just observed with the spin of the
π± mesons, namely we have a particle which carries an elementary electri-
cal charge with spin 1/2, and nevertheless the particle does not have spin.
The explanation of s(K±) = 0 follows the same lines as the explanation of

53

the spin of the π± mesons. In the standing wave model the K± mesons are
described by the state (2.)π± + π0, that means by the second mode of the
lattice oscillations of the π± mesons plus a π0 meson. The second mode of
the longitudinal oscillations of a neutral neutrino lattice does not have a net
i j(νi) = 0. But the spin of the neutrinos
intrinsic angular momentum
contributes an angular momentum ¯h/2, which originates from the neutrino
or antineutrino in the center of the lattice, just as it is with the neutrino
lattice in the π± mesons, so
i j(ni) = j(n0) = ¯h/2. Adding an elementary
electric charge with a spin opposite to the net intrinsic angular momentum
of the neutrino lattice creates the charged (2.)π± mode which has zero spin

P

P

j((2.)π±) =

j(ni) + j(e±) = j(n0) + j(e±) = 0 .

(87)

Xi

As discussed in Section 6 it is necessary to add a π0 meson to the second mode
of the π± mesons in order to obtain the correct mass and the correct decays
of the K± mesons. Since the π0 meson does not have spin the addition of the
π0 meson does not add to the intrinsic angular momentum of the K± mesons.
So s(K±) = 0 as it must be.

P

The explanation of s = 0 of the K0 and K0 mesons described by the state
(2.)π± + π∓ is diﬀerent because there is now no electric charge whose spin
canceled the spin of the neutrino lattice in π±. The longitudinal oscillations
of the second mode of π± as well as of the basic π∓ mode do not create
i j(νi) = 0. The second mode of the π± mesons,
an angular momentum,
or the (2.)π± state, and the basic π∓ mode each have N′/2 neutrinos and
N′/2 antineutrinos plus a center neutrino or antineutrino, so the number of
all neutrinos and antineutrinos in the sum of both states, the K0 meson, is
2N. Since the size of the lattice of the K± mesons and the K0 mesons is the
same it follows that two neutrinos are at each lattice point of the K0 or
K0 mesons. We assume that Pauli’s exclusion principle applies to neutrinos
as well. Consequently each neutrino at each lattice point must share its
location with an antineutrino. That means that the contribution of the spin
of all neutrinos and antineutrinos to the intrinsic angular momentum of the
K0 meson is zero or
i j(2ni) = 0. The sum of the spin vectors of the two
opposite charges in the K0 and K0 mesons, or in the (2.)π± + π∓ state, is
also zero. Since neither the lattice oscillations nor the spin of the neutrinos
and antineutrinos nor the electric charges contribute an angular momentum

P

j(K0) =

j(νi) +

j(2ni) + j(e+ + e−) = 0 .

(88)

54

The intrinsic angular momentum of the K0 and K0 mesons is zero, or s(K0,K0)
= 0, as it must be. In simple terms, since the structure of K0 is (2.)π+ +
π−, the spin of K0 is the sum of the spin of (2.)π+ and of π−, both of which
do not have spin. It does not seem possible to arrive at s(K0,K0) = 0 if both
particles do not contain the N pairs of neutrinos and antineutrinos required
by the (2.)π± + π∓ state which we have suggested in Section 6.

In the case of the neutron one must wonder how it comes about that a
particle which seems to be the superposition of two particles without spin
ends up with spin 1/2. The neutron, which has a mass ≈ 2m(K±) or 2m(K0),
is either the superposition of a K+ and a K− meson or of a K0 and a K0 meson.
The intrinsic angular momentum of the superposition of K+ and K− is either
0 or ¯h, which means that the neutron cannot be the superposition of K+ and
K−. For a proof of this statement we refer to [56].

On the other hand the neutron can be the superposition of a K0 and a
K0 meson. A signiﬁcant change in the lattice occurs when a K0 and a K0
meson are superposed. Since each K0 meson contains N neutrinos and N an-
tineutrinos, as we discussed before in context with the spin of K0, the number
of all neutrinos and antineutrinos in superposed K0 and K0 lattices is 4N.
Since the size of the lattice of the proton as well of the neutron is the same
as the size of K0 each of the N lattice points of the neutron now contains four
neutrinos, a muon neutrino and an anti-muon neutrino as well as an electron
neutrino and an anti-electron neutrino. The νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe quadrupoles oscil-
late just like individual neutrinos do because we learned from Eq.(7) that
the ratios of the oscillation frequencies are independent of the mass as well
In the neutrino
as of the interaction constant between the lattice points.
i j(4ni) =
quadrupoles the spin of the neutrinos and antineutrinos cancels,

the circular oscillations of frequency ωi, contribute as before the angular mo-
i j(ωi) = j(ω0) = ¯h/2. The
mentum of the center circular oscillation, so
spin and charge of the four electrical charges e+e−e+e− hidden in the sum
of the K0 and K0 mesons cancel, j(4e±) = 0.
It follows that the intrinsic
angular momentum of a neutron created by the superposition of a K0 and a
K0 meson comes from the circular neutrino lattice oscillations only and is

j(n) =

j(ωi) +

as it must be. In simple terms, the spin of the neutron originates from the
superposition of two circular neutrino lattice oscillations with the frequencies

55

ω and − ω shifted in phase by π, which produces the angular momentum ¯h/2
at the center.

The spin of the proton is 1/2 and is unambiguously deﬁned by the decay
of the neutron n → p + e− + ¯νe. We have suggested in Section 7 that 3/4·N′
anti-electron neutrinos of the neutrino lattice of the neutron are removed in
the β-decay of the neutron and that the other N′/4 anti-electron neutrinos
leave with the emitted electron. The intrinsic angular momentum of the
proton originates then from the spin of the central νµ¯νµνe triplet, from the
spin of the e+e−e+ triplet which is part of the remains of the neutron, and
from the angular momentum of the center of the lattice oscillations with
the superposition of two circular oscillations. The spin of the central νµ¯νµνe
triplet is canceled by the spin of the e+e−e+ triplet. According to the standing
wave model the intrinsic angular momentum of the proton is

j(p) = j(νµ¯νµνe)0 + j(e+e−e+) + j(ω0) = j(ω0) = ¯h/2 ,

(90)

as it must be.

The other mesons of the neutrino branch, the D±,0 and D±

s mesons, both
having zero spin, are superpositions of a proton and an antineutron of op-
posite spin, or of their antiparticles, or of a neutron and an antineutron of
opposite spin in D0. The spin of D± and D0 does therefore not pose a new
problem.

For an explanation of the spin of µ± we refer to [62]. Since all muon or
anti-muon neutrinos have been removed from the π± lattice in the π± decay
it follows that a neutrino vacancy is at the center of the µ± lattice (Fig. 6).
Without a neutrino in the center of the lattice the sum of the spin vectors of
all neutrinos in the µ± lattice is zero. However the µ± mesons consist of the
neutrino lattice plus an electric charge e± whose spin is 1/2. The spin of the
µ± mesons originates from the spin of the elementary electric charge carried
by the µ± mesons and is consequently s(µ±) = 1/2. The same considerations
apply for the spin of τ ±, s(τ ±) = 1/2.

An explanation of the spin of the mesons and baryons can only be valid
if the same explanation also applies to the antiparticles of these particles
whose spin is the same as that of the ordinary particles. The antiparticles of
the γ-branch consist of electromagnetic waves whose frequencies diﬀer from
the frequencies of the ordinary particles only by their sign. The angular mo-
mentum of the superposition of two circular oscillations with − ω and ω has
the same angular momentum as the superposition of two circular oscillations

56

with frequencies of opposite sign, as in Λ. Consequently the spin of the an-
tiparticles of the γ-branch is the same as the spin of the ordinary particles of
the γ-branch. The same considerations apply to the circular neutrino lattice
oscillations which cause the spin of the neutron, the only particle of the ν-
branch which has spin. In the standing wave model the spin of the neutron
and the antineutron is the same.

Let us summarize: The spin of the particles of the ν-branch originates
from the angular momentum vectors of the oscillations and the spin vectors
of the neutrinos in the particles and the spin vector of the elementary elec-
tric charge or charges a particle carries. The contribution of all or all but
one of the O(109) oscillations and O(109) neutrinos to the intrinsic angular
momentum of the particles must cancel, otherwise the spin cannot be either
0 or 1/2. It requires the symmetry of a cubic lattice for this to happen. The
center of the lattices alone determines the intrinsic angular momentum of the
oscillations and neutrinos in the lattice. Adding to that the spin vector of
one (or more) elementary electric charges with spin 1/2 and we arrive at the
total intrinsic angular momentum of a particle. The most illuminating case
are the π± mesons which do not have spin although they carry an elementary
electric charge. Actually the lattice of the π± mesons has spin 1/2 from its
central neutrino, but this spin vector is canceled by the spin of the electric
charge e±, so s(π±) = 0.

From the foregoing we arrive also at an understanding of the reason for
the astonishing fact that the intrinsic angular momentum or spin of the par-
ticles is independent of the mass of the particles, as exempliﬁed by the spin
¯h/2 of the electron being the same as the spin ¯h/2 of the proton, notwith-
standing the fact that the mass of the proton is 1836 times larger than the
mass of the electron. However, in our model, the spin of the particles includ-
ing the electron is determined solely by the angular momentum ¯h/2 at the
center of the lattice, the other angular momentum vectors in the particles
cancel. Hence the mass of the particles in the other 109 lattice points is in-
consequential for the intrinsic angular momentum of the particles. The spin
is also independent of the number of the lattice points in a cubic lattice. In
our model the spin of the particles is independent of the mass of the particles,
as it must be.

12 The spin and magnetic moment

of the electron

The model of the electron we have proposed in Section 8 has, in order to be
valid, to pass a crucial test; the model has to explain satisfactorily the spin
and the magnetic moment of the electron. When Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit
[50] (U&G) discovered the existence of the spin of the electron they also pro-
posed that the electron has a magnetic moment with a value equal to Bohr’s
magnetic moment µB = e¯h/2m(e±)c⋆. Bohr’s magnetic moment results from
the motion of an electron on a circular orbit around a proton. The magnetic
moment of the electron postulated by U&G has been conﬁrmed experimen-
tally, but has been corrected by about 0.11% for the so-called anomalous
magnetic moment. If one tries to explain the magnetic moment of the elec-
tron with an electric charge moving on a circular orbit around the particle
center, analogous to the magnetic moment of hydrogen, one ends up with ve-
locities larger than the velocity of light, which cannot be, as already noted by
U&G. It remains to be explained how the magnetic moment of the electron
comes about.

We will have to explain the spin of the electron ﬁrst. The spin, or the
intrinsic angular momentum of a particle is, of course, the sum of the angular
momentum vectors of all components of the particle. In the electron these
are the neutrinos and the electric oscillations. Each neutrino has spin 1/2
and in order for the electron to have s = 1/2 all, or all but one, of the spin
vectors of the neutrinos in their lattice must cancel. If the neutrinos are in
a simple cubic lattice as in Fig. 7 and the center particle of the lattice is not
a neutrino, as in Fig. 7, the spin vectors of all neutrinos cancel, Σ j(ni) = 0,
provided that the spin vectors of the neutrinos of the lattice point in opposite
direction at their mirror points in the lattice. Otherwise the spin vectors of
the neutrinos would add up and make a very large angular momentum. We
follow here the procedure we used in [56] to explain the spin of the muons.
The spin vectors of all electron neutrinos in the electron cancel, just as the
spin vectors of all muon and electron neutrinos in the muons cancel, because
there is a neutrino vacancy at the center of their lattices, Figs. 6,7.

We will now see whether the electric oscillations in the electron contribute
to its angular momentum. As we said in context with Eq.(46) there must
be two times as many electric oscillations in the electron lattice than there
are neutrinos. The oscillations can either be standing waves consisting of

58

two perpendicular linear oscillations shifted in phase by π/2 or two circular
oscillations with the frequencies ω and − ω. Both the standing waves and
the circular oscillations are non-progressive and can be part of the rest mass
of a particle. We will now assume that the electric oscillation are circular.
Circular oscillations have an angular momentum ~j = m ~r × ~v. And, as in
the case of the spin vectors of the neutrinos, all or all but one of the O(109)
angular momentum vectors of the electric oscillations must cancel in order
for the electron to have spin 1/2. We describe the superposition of the two
oscillations by

x(t) = exp[iωt] + exp[− i(ωt + π)] ,

y(t) = exp[i(ωt + π/2)] + exp[− i(ωt + 3π/2)] ,

that means by the superposition of an oscillation with the frequency ω and
a second oscillation with the frequency − ω as in Eqs.(79,80). The oscilla-
tion with − ω is shifted in phase by π. Negative frequencies are permitted
solutions of the equations of motion in a cubic lattice, Eqs.(7,13). As is well-
known oscillating electric charges should emit radiation. However, this rule
does already not hold in the hydrogen atom, so we will assume that the rule
does not hold within the electron either.

In circular oscillations the kinetic energy is always equal to the potential

energy and the sum of both is the total energy. From

follows, as discussed in Eqs.(83,84), that the angular momentum of the su-
perposition of the two circular oscillations is

Epot + Ekin = 2 Ekin = Etot

j = Θ ω = ¯h/2 .

That means that each of the O(109) superposed circular oscillations has an
angular momentum ¯h/2.

The circulation of the circular oscillations in Eqs.(91,92) is opposite for
all φ of opposite sign. It follows from the equation for the displacements un
of the lattice points Eq.(5)

un = Aei(ω t + nφ) ,

(95)

(91)

(92)

(93)

(94)

59

that the velocities of the lattice points are given by

vn = ˙un = i ωn un .

(96)

(97)

The sign of ωn changes with the sign of φ because the frequencies are given
by Eq.(13), that means by

ωn = ± ω0( φn + φ0 ) .

Consequently the circulation of the electric oscillations is opposite to the
circulation at the mirror points in the lattice and the angular momentum
vectors cancel, but for the angular momentum vector of the electric oscillation
at the center of the lattice. The center circular oscillation has, as all other
electric oscillations, the angular momentum ¯h/2 as Eq.(94) says. The angular
momentum of the entire electron lattice is therefore

j(e±) =

j(ni) +

j(eli) = j(el0) = ¯h/2 ,

as it must be for spin s = 1/2. The explanation of the spin of the electron
given here follows the explanation of the spin of the baryons, as well as the
explanation of the absence of spin in the mesons. A valid explanation of
the spin must be applicable to all particles, in particular to the electron, the
prototype of a particle with spin.

We will now turn to the magnetic moment of the electron which is known
with extraordinary accuracy, µe = 1.001 159 652 187 µB, according to the Re-
view of Particle Physics [2]. The decimals after 1.00 µB are caused by the
anomalous magnetic moment which we will not consider. As is well-known
the magnetic dipole moment of a particle with spin is, in Gaussian units,
given by

~µ = g

e¯h
2mc⋆

~s ,

(99)

where g is the dimensionless Land´e factor, m the rest mass of the particle
that carries the charge e and ~s the spin vector. The g-factor has been intro-
duced in order to bring the magnetic moment of the electron into agreement
with the experimental facts. As U&G postulated and as has been conﬁrmed
experimentally the g-factor of the electron is 2. With the spin s = 1/2 and
g = 2 the magnetic dipole moment of the electron is

µe = e¯h/2m(e±)c⋆ ,

(100)

60

or one Bohr magneton µB in agreement with the experiments, neglecting
the anomalous moment. For a structureless point particle Dirac [51] has
explained why g = 2 for the electron. However we consider here an electron
with a ﬁnite size and which is at rest. When it is at rest the electron has still
its magnetic moment. Dirac’s theory does therefore not apply here.

The only part of Eq.(100) that can be changed in order to explain the
g-factor of an electron with structure is the ratio e/m which deals with the
spatial distribution of charge and mass. If part of the mass of the electron
is non-electromagnetic and the non-electromagnetic part of the mass does
not contribute to the magnetic moment of the electron, which to all that
we know is true for neutrinos, then the ratio e/m in Eq.(99) is not e/m(e±)
in the case of the electron. The elementary charge e certainly remains un-
changed, but e/m depends on what fraction of the mass of the electron is of
electromagnetic origin and what fraction of the mass is non-electromagnetic.
Only the current, not the mass of a current loop, determines the magnetic
moment of a loop. As we have shown above one half of the mass of the elec-
tron is of electric origin, the other half of m(e±) is made of neutrinos which
do not contribute to the magnetic moment. That means that in the electron
the mass that carries the charge e is m(e±)/2. The magnetic moment of the
electron is then

~µe = g

e¯h
2m(e±)/2 · c⋆

~s ,

(101)

and with s = 1/2 we have µe = g e¯h/2m(e±)c⋆. Because of Eq.(100) the
g-factor must be equal to one and is unnecessary. In other words, if one half
of the mass of the electron consists of neutrinos, then it follows automatically
that the electron has the correct magnetic moment µe = e¯h/2m(e±)c⋆ without
the artiﬁcial g-factor.

Conclusions

We conclude that the standing wave model solves a number of problems for
which an answer heretofore has been hard to come by. From the creation of
the π0 meson and its decay 10−16 sec later into γγ follows that the π0 meson
and the other particles of the γ-branch must consist of standing electromag-
netic waves. The rest masses of the particles of the γ-branch obey the integer
multiple rule. From the creation of the π± mesons and their decay follows
that the π± mesons and the other particles of the ν-branch must consist of

61

a lattice of νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos, their oscillation energies and one or more
elementary electrical charges. From the explanation of the π± mesons fol-
lows that the rest mass of the µ± mesons is ∼= 3/4 of the rest mass of the
π± mesons and it also follows that 1/2 of the rest mass of the electron or
positron must consist of electron neutrinos or anti-electron neutrinos. The
rest mass of the µ± mesons is so much larger than the rest mass of the elec-
tron or positron because the rest mass of the muon neutrinos is so much
larger than the rest mass of the electron or anti-electron neutrinos. Neither
the electron nor the muon are point particles, which does not contradict the
experimental evidence, because neutrino lattices cannot be detected by con-
ventional electron scattering experiments. Only photons, neutrinos, charge
and the weak nuclear force are needed to explain the masses of the electron,
muon and of the stable mesons and baryons and their antiparticles. We can
explain the spin of the baryons and the absence of spin in the mesons, and
the spin of the electron, muon and tau lepton as well, without making addi-
tional assumptions. We have also determined the rest masses of the e, µ and
τ neutrinos.

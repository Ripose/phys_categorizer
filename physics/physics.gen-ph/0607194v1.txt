One-dimensional detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (1D DFA) and multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis (1D MF-DFA) are widely used in the scaling analysis of fractal and multifractal time
series because of being accurate and easy to implement.
In this paper we generalize the one-
dimensional DFA and MF-DFA to form high-dimensional versions. The generalization works well
when tested with synthetic surfaces (fractional Brownian surfaces and multifractal surfaces). The
two-dimensional MF-DFA is also adopted to analyze two images from nature and experiment and
nice scaling laws are unraveled.

INTRODUCTION

Fractals and multifractals are ubiquitous in natural
and social sciences [1]. Fractal and multifractal prop-
erties have been extensively investigated in time series
which is one of the most usual record of observable
quantities. There are many methods proposed for these
purpose [2, 3], such as spectral analysis, rescaled range
analysis [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], ﬂuctuation analysis [10], de-
trended ﬂuctuation analysis [11, 12, 13], wavelet trans-
form module maxima (WTMM) [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], de-
trended moving average [19, 20, 21, 22, 23], to list a few.
It is now the common consensus that DFA and WTMM
have the highest precision in the scaling analysis [2, 3, 24].
The idea of DFA was invented originally to investigate
the long-range dependence in coding and noncoding DNA
nucleotides sequence [11]. Then it is generalized to study
the multifractal nature hidden in time series, which is
termed as multifractal DFA (MF-DFA) [13]. Due to the
simplicity in implementation, the DFA is now becoming
the most important method in the ﬁeld.

Although the WTMM method seems a little bit com-
plicated,
it is no doubt a very power method, es-
pecially for high-dimensional objects, such as images,
scalar and vector ﬁelds of three-dimensional turbulence
[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. In contrast, the original DFA method
is not designed for such purpose.
In a recent paper, a
ﬁrst eﬀort is taken to apply DFA to study the roughness
features of texture images [30]. Speciﬁcally, the DFA is
applied to extract Hurst indices of the one-dimensional
sequences at diﬀerent image orientations and their aver-
age scaling exponent is estimated. Unfortunately, this is
nevertheless an one-dimensional DFA method.

In this work, we generalized the DFA (and MF-DFA as
well) method from one-dimensional to high-dimensional.
The generalized methods are tested by synthetic surfaces
(fractional Brownian surfaces and multifractal surfaces)

with known fractal and multifractal properties. The re-
sults are in excellent agreement with the theoretical prop-
erties. We then apply these methods to practical exam-
ples. We argue that there are tremendous potential ap-
plications of the generalized DFA to many objects, such
as the roughness of fracture surfaces, landscapes, clouds,
three-dimensional temperature ﬁelds and concentration
ﬁelds, turbulence velocity ﬁelds.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we rep-
resent the two-dimensional detrended ﬂuctuation anla-
ysis and two-dimesional multifractal detrended ﬂuctua-
tion anlaysis. Section III shows the results of the nu-
merical simulations and compares with theoretical prop-
erties. Applications to practical examples are illustrated
in Sec. IV. We discuss and conclude in Sec. V.

II. METHOD

A. Two dimensional DFA

Being a direct generalization, the high dimensional
DFA and MF-DFA have quite similar procedures as the
one dimensional DFA. We shall focus on two dimen-
sional space and the generalization to higher dimension
is straightforward. The two dimension DFA consists of
the following steps.

Step 1: Consider a self-similar (or self-aﬃne) surface,
which is denoted by a two-dimensional array X(i, j),
where i = 1, 2, · · · , M , and j = 1, 2, · · · , N . The surface
is partitioned into Ms×Ns disjoint square segments of the
same size s, where Ms = [M/s] and Ns = [N/s]. Each
segment can be denoted by Xv,w such that Xv,w(i, j) =
X(l1 + i, l2 + j) for 1 6 i, j 6 s, where l1 = (v − 1)s and
l2 = (w − 1)s.

Step 2: For each segment Xv,w identiﬁed by v and w,

the cumulative sum uv,w(i, j) is calculated as follows:

uv,w(i, j) =

Xv,w(k1, k2) ,

(1)

i

j

Xk1=1

Xk2=1

where 1 6 i, j 6 s. Note that uv,w is itself a surface.

Step 3: The trend of the constructed surface uv,w can
be determined by ﬁtting it with a prechosen bivariate
polynomial function
u. The simplest function could be
a plane. In this work, we shall adopt the following ﬁve
functions to test the validation of the methods:

e

uv,w(i, j) = ai + bj + c ,
uv,w(i, j) = ai2 + bj2 + c ,
e
uv,w(i, j) = aij + bi + cj + d ,
e
uv,w(i, j) = ai2 + bj2 + ci + dj + e ,
e
uv,w(i, j) = ai2 + bj2 + cij + di + ej + f ,
e

(2)

(3)
(4)

(5)

(6)

e

where 1 6 i, j 6 s and a, b, c, d, e, and f are free param-
eters to be determined. These parameters can be calcu-
lated easily by simple matrix operations, derived from the
least squares method. We can then obtain the residual
matrix

ǫv,w(i, j) = uv,w(i, j) −

uv,w(i, j) .

(7)

The detrended ﬂuctuation function F (v, w, s) of the seg-
ment Xv,w is deﬁned via the sample variance of the resid-
ual matrix ǫv,w(i, j) as follows:

e

s

F 2(v, w, s) =

ǫv,w(i, j)2 .

(8)

i=1
X
Note that the mean of the residual is zero due to the
detrending procedure.

j=1
X

Step 4: The overall detrended ﬂuctuation is calculated

by averaging over all the segments, that is,

F 2(s) =

1
MsNs

Ms

Ns

v=1
X

w=1
X

F 2(v, w, s) .

(9)

Step 5: Varying the value of s in the range from smin ≈
6 to smax ≈ min(M, N )/4, we can determine the scaling
relation between the detrended ﬂuctuation function F (s)
and the size scale s, which reads

F (s) ∼ sH ,

(10)

where H is the Hurst index of the surface [3, 31, 32, 33],
which can be related to the fractal dimension by D =
3 − H [1, 34].

Since N and M need not be a multiple of the segment
size s, two orthogonal trips at the end of the proﬁle may
remain. In order to take these ending parts of the surface
into consideration, the same partitioning procedure can
be repeated starting from the other three corners [31].

2

MF-DFA can be ascribed similarly, such that the two di-
mensional DFA serves as a special case of the two dimen-
sional MF-DFA. The two dimensional MF-DFA follows
the same ﬁrst three steps as in the two dimensional DFA
and has two revised steps.

Divide a self-similar (or self-aﬃne) surface X(i, j) into
Ms × Ns (Ms = [M/s] and Ns = [N/s]) disjoint phalanx
segments. In each segment Xv,w(i, j) compute the cumu-
lative sum u(i, j, s) using Eq. (1). With one of the ﬁve
regression equations, we can obtain
u(i, j, s) to represent
the trend in each segment, then we obtain the ﬂuctuate
function F (v, w, s) by Eq. (8).

Step 4: The overall detrended ﬂuctuation is calculated

e

by averaging over all the segments, that is,

Ms

Fq(s) =

where q can take any real value except for q = 0. When
q = 0, we have

Step 5: Varying the value of s in the range from smin ≈
6 to smax ≈ min(M, N )/4, we can determine the scaling
relation between the detrended ﬂuctuation function Fq(s)
and the size scale s, which reads

1/q

)

)

For each q, we can get the corresponding traditional

τ (q) function through

Fq(s) ∼ sh(q) .

τ (q) = qh(q) − Df ,

(13)

(14)

where Df is the fractal dimension of the geometric sup-
port of the multifractal measure [13]. It is thus easy to
obtain the generalized dimensions Dq [35, 36, 37] and
the singularity strength function α(q) and the multifrac-
tal spectrum f (α) via Legendre transform [38]. In this
work, the numerical and real multifractals have Df = 2.
For fractional Brownian surfaces with a Hurst index H,
we have h(q) ≡ H.

C. A note on the generalization

To the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst few steps in
the one dimensional DFA and MF-DFA are organized
in the following order: Construct the cumulative sum of
the time series and then partition it into segments of the
same scale without overlapping.
In this way, a direct
generalization to higher dimensional space should be the
following:

u(i, j) =

X(k1, k2),

(15)

i

j

Xk1=1

Xk2=1

B. Two dimensional MF-DFA

Step I: Construct the cumulative sum

Analogous to the generalization of one dimensional
DFA to one dimensional MF-DFA, the two dimensional

Step II: Partition u(i, j) into Ns × Ms disjoint square
segments. The ensuing steps are the same as those de-
scribed in the Sec. II A and Sec. II B.

It is easy to show that, for the one dimensional DFA
and MF-DFA, the residual matrix in a given segment
is the same no matter which step is processed ﬁrst, ei-
ther the cumulative summation or the partitioning. This
means that we can have two manners of generalization
to high dimensional space, as Steps 1-2 in Sec. II A and
Steps I-II aforementioned. Our numerical simulations
show that both these two kinds of generalization gives
the correct Hurst index for fractional Brownian surfaces
when adopting two dimensional DFA. However, the two
dimensional MF-DFA with Steps I-II gives wrong τ (q)
function for two dimensional multifractals with analytic
solutions, while the generalization with Steps 1-2 does a
nice job.

The diﬀerence of the two generalization methods be-
comes clear when we compare uv,w(i, j) in Eq. (1) and
u(i, j) in Eq. (15). We see that uv,w(l1 + i, l2 + j) is local-
ized to the segment Xv,w, while u(l1 + i, l2 + j) contains
extra information outside the segment when i < l1 and
j < l2, which is not constant for diﬀerent i and j and
thus can not be removed by the detrending procedure.
In the following sections, we shall therefore concentrate
on the correct generalization expressed in Sec. II A and
Sec. II B.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

A. Synthetic fractional Brownian surfaces

We test the two dimensional DFA with synthetic frac-
tional Brownian surfaces. There are many diﬀerent meth-
ods to create fractal surfaces, based on Fourier transform
ﬁltering [34, 39], midpoint displacement and its vari-
ants [1, 40, 41], circulant embedding of covariance ma-
trix [42, 43, 44, 45], periodic embedding and fast Fourier
transform [46], top-down hierarchical model [47], and so
on. In this paper, we use the free MATLAB software Fr-
acLab 2.03 developed by INRIA to synthesize fractional
Brownian surfaces with Hurst index H.

In our test, we have investigated fractional Brownian
surfaces with diﬀerent Hurst indices H ranging from 0.05
to 0.95 with an increment of 0.05. The size of the simu-
lated surfaces are 500 × 500. For each H, we generated
500 surfaces. Each surface is analyzed by the two dimen-
sional DFA with the ﬁve bivariate functions in Eqs. (2-6).
The results are shown in Fig. 1. We can see that the es-
timated Hurst index ˆH are very closed to the preset val-
ues in general. The deviation of Hurst index H becomes
larger for large values of H.

In Fig. 2, we show the log-log plot of the detrended
ﬂuctuation F (s) as a function of s for two synthetic frac-
tional Brownian surfaces with H = 0.2 and H = 0.8,
respectively. There is no doubt that the power-law scal-
ing between F (s) and s is very evident and sound. Hence,

the two dimensional DFA is able to well capture the self-
similar nature of the fractional Brownian surfaces and
results in precise estimations of the Hurst indices.

We also adopted fractional Brownian surfaces to test
the two dimensional multifractal detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis.
Speciﬁcally, we have simulated three frac-
tional Brownian surfaces with Hurst indexes H1 = 0.2,
H2 = 0.5, and H3 = 0.8, respectively. The ﬁve regression
equations (2-6) are used in the detrending. We calculated
h(q) for q ranging from −10 to 10 according to Eq. (13).
All the Fq(s) functions exhibit excellent power-law scal-
ing with respect the the scale s. The function τ (q) can
be determined according to Eq. (14). The resultant τ (q)
functions are plotted in Fig. 3 with the inset showing the
h(q) functions. We can ﬁnd from the ﬁgure that, for each
surface, the ﬁve functions of τ (q) (and h(q) as well) cor-
responding to the ﬁve detrending functions collapse on a
single curve. Moreover, it is evident that h(q) = H and
τ (q) = qH − 2. The three analytic straight lines intersect
at the same point (q = 0, τ (q) = −2). These results are
expected according to theoretical analysis.

We stress that, when fractional Brownian surfaces are
under investigation, both the two dimensional DFA and
MF-DFA can produce the same correction results even
when Steps I-II are adopted.

B. Synthetic two dimensional multifractals

Now we turn to test the MF-DFA method with syn-
thetic two dimensional multifractal measures. There ex-
its several methods for the synthesis of two dimensional
multifractal measures or multifractal rough surfaces [26].
The most classic method follows a multiplicative cascad-
ing process, which can be either deterministic or stochas-
tic [48, 49, 50, 51]. The simplest one is the p-model pro-
posed to mimick the kinetic energy dissipation ﬁeld in

fully developed turbulence [49]. Starting from a square,
one partitions it into four sub-squares of the same size
and chooses randomly two of them to assign the measure
of p/2 and the remaining two of (1 − p)/2. This distribu-
tion process repeated and we obtain a singular measure
µ. A straightforward derivation following the partition
function method [38] results in the analytic expression:

τ (q) = q − 1 − log2 [pq + (1 − p)q] .

(16)

A relevant method is the fractionally integrated sin-
gular cascade (FISC) method, which was proposed to
model multifractal geophysical ﬁelds [52] and turbulent
ﬁelds [53]. The FISC method consists of a straightfor-
ward ﬁltering in Fourier space via fractional integration
of a singular multifractal measure generated with some
multiplicative cascade process so that the multifractal
measure is transformed into a smoother multifractal sur-
face:

tively. The inset shows the corresponding h(q) functions.

The third one is called the random W cascade method
which generates multifractal rough surfaces from random
cascade process on separable wavelet orthogonal basis
[26].

In our test, we adopted the ﬁrst method for the syn-
thesis of two dimensional multifractal measure. Starting
from a square, one partitions it into four sub-squares of
the same size and assigns four given proportions of mea-
sure p1 = 0.05, p2 = 0.15, p3 = 0.20, and p4 = 0.60 to
them. Then each sub-square is divided into four smaller
squares and the measure is redistributed in the same way.
This procedure is repeated 10 times and we generate mul-
tifractal “surfaces” of size 1024×1024. The resultant τ (q)
functions estimated from the two dimensional MF-DFA
method are plotted in Fig. 4, where the inset showing
the h(q) functions. We can ﬁnd that the ﬁve functions
of τ (q) (and h(q) as well) corresponding to the ﬁve de-
trending functions collapse on a single curve, which is in
excellent agreement with the theoretical formula:

τ (q) = − log2 (pq

1 + pq

2 + pq

3 + pq

4) .

(19)

We stress that, when we use Steps I-II instead of Steps
1-2, the resulting τ (q) estimated by the MF-DFA method
deviates remarkably from the theoretical formula and is
thus completely wrong. In addition, we see that diﬀer-
ent detrending functions give almost the same results.
The linear function (2) is preferred in practice, since it
requires the least computational time among the ﬁve.

In this section we apply the generalized method to an-
alyze two real images, as shown in Fig. 5. Both pictures
are investigated by the MF-DFA approach since it con-
tains automatically the DFA analysis. The ﬁrst example

ear with respect to q or, in other words, h(q) is dependent
of q, then the investigated picture has the nature of mul-
tifractality.

which can be found at http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov. The size
of the landscale image is 2048 × 1536 pixels. The second
example is a typical scanning electron microscope (SEM)
picture of the surface of a polyurethane sample foamed
with supercritical carbon dioxide. The size of the forming
surface picture is 1200 × 800 pixels.

FIG. 5: Left: The image of the Yardangs region on the Mars.
Right: A scanning electron microscope picture of the surface

The SEM picture of the surface of a polyurethane sam-
ple were prepared in an experiment of polymer foaming
with supercritical carbon dioxide. At the beginning of the
experiment, several prepared polyurethane samples were
placed in a high-pressure vessel full of supercritical car-
bon dioxide at saturation temperature for gas sorption.
After the samples were saturated with supercritical CO2,
the carbon dioxide was quickly released from the high-
pressure vessel. Then the foamed polyurethane samples
were put into cool water to stabilize the structure cells.
Pictures of the formed samples were taken by a scanning
electron microscope.

The two images were stored in the computer as two di-
mensional arrays in 256 prey levels. We used Eq. (2) for
the detrending procedure. The two dimensional arrays
were investigated by the multifractal detrended ﬂuctu-

B. Analyzing the Mars landscape image

We ﬁrst analyze the Mars landscape image shown in
the left panel of Fig. 5 with MF-DFA. Figure 6 illustrates
the dependence of the detrended ﬂuctuation Fq(s) as a
function of the scale s for diﬀerent values of q marked
with diﬀerent symbols. The continuous curves are the
best linear ﬁts. The perfect collapse of the data points
on the linear lines indicates the evident power law scal-
ing between Fq(s) and s, which means that the Mars
landscape is self-similar.

The slopes of the straight lines in Fig. 6 give the es-
timates of h(q) and the function τ (q) can be calculated
accordingly. In Fig. 7 is shown the dependence of τ (q)
with respect to q for −6 6 q 6 6. We observe that τ (q) is
linear with respect to q. This excellent linearity of τ (q) is
consistent with the fact that h(q) is almost independent
of q, as shown in the inset. Hence, the Mars landscape
image does not possess multifractal nature.

C. Analyzing the forming surface image

Similarly, we analyzed the forming surface shown in the
right panel of Fig. 5 with the MF-DFA method. Figure

Fq(s) as a function of the scale s for diﬀerent values of
q marked with diﬀerent symbols. The continuous curves

The values of h(q) are estimated by the slopes of the
straight lines illustrated in Fig. 8 for diﬀerent values of q.
The corresponding function τ (q) is determined according
to Eq. (14). In Fig. 9 is illustrated τ (q) as a function of
q for −6 6 q 6 6. We observe that τ (q) is nonlinear with
respect to q, which is further conﬁrmed by the fact that
h(q) is dependent of q, as shown in the inset. The non-
linearity of τ (q) and h(q) shows that the forming surface
has multifractal nature.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In summary, we have generalized the one-dimensional
detrended ﬂuctuation analysis and multifractal de-

trended ﬂuctuation analysis to two-dimensional versions.
Further generalization to higher dimensions is straight-
forward. We have found that the high-dimensional DFA
methods should be performed locally in the sense that
the cumulative summation should be conducted after the
partitioning of the high-dimensional multifractal object.
Extensive numerical simulations validate our generaliza-
tion. The two-dimensional MF-DFA is applied to the
processing of the Mars landscape image and forming sur-
face image. The Mars landscape is found to be a fractal
while the forming surface exhibits multifractality.

At last, we would like to stress that there are tremen-
dous potential applications of the generalized DFA in the
analysis of fractals and multifractals. In the two dimen-
sional case, the methods can be adopted to the investi-
gation of the roughness of fracture surfaces, landscapes,
clouds, and many other images possessing self-similar
properties.
In the case of three dimensional, it could
be utilized to qualify the multifractal nature of temper-
ature ﬁelds and concentration ﬁelds. Possible examples
in higher dimensions are stranger attractors in nonlinear
dynamics. Concrete applications will be reported else-
where in the future publications.

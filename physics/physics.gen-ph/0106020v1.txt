Possible application of a result published recently is announced. According to this result the
chaotic energy of thermal ﬂuctuation can be transformed in electric energy of direct current in an
inhomogeneous superconducting ring. Although the power of this transformation is very weak this
eﬀect has optimistic perspective of wide application because useful energy can be obtained from heat
energy in the equilibrium state. It is proved that this process is possible in spite of the prohibition
by the second law of thermodynamics. It is shown that the second law of thermodynamics can be
broken in a quantum system.

1. Introduction

Superconductors are used ﬁrst of all as the conductors
with zero resistivity. But the superconductivity is not
only the inﬁnite conductivity. It is ﬁrst of all a macro-
scopic quantum phenomena. The long-range phase co-
herence can exist in a superconducting state. The zero
resistivity can be considered as one of the consequences
of the phase coherence. A non-zero velocity of the super-
conducting electrons vs can exist without a voltage in a
state with long-range phase coherence because

vs =

in this state. Here ϕ is the phase of the wave function;
A is the vector potential; m is the electron mass and e
is the electron charge. Other consequences of the phase
coherence are the Meissner eﬀect [1], the quantization of
the magnetic ﬂux in a superconductor and the quanti-
zation of the velocity in a superconducting ring. In the

dl∇ϕ must be an integer number since the
2π

wave function Ψ = |Ψ|exp(iϕ) of the superconducting
electrons must be a simple function. Φ0 = π¯hc/e =
2.07 10−7 G cm2 is the ﬂux quantum; Φ is the mag-
netic ﬂux contained within the closed path of integration
l. If the ϕ(r) function does not have a singularity inside
l then n = 0. It is the cause of the Meissner eﬀect. The
ϕ(r) function can have a singularity only if a nonsuper-
conducting hole is inside the superconductor. n can be a
non-zero integer number in this case. If the superconduc-
tor thickness around the hole is big then a closed path
l exists on which vs = 0. According to (2) Φ = nΦ0 in
this case. In a opposite case of a superconducting ring
with a narrow wall w the quantization of the velocity
takes place. If the wall thickness is much smaller than
the penetration depth of magnetic ﬁeld w ¡¡ λ then LIs ¡¡

Here L is the inductance of the ring; Is = sjs = s2ensvs
is the superconducting current in the ring; ns is the den-
sity of superconducting pairs; l = 2πR; R is the ring
radius; B is the induction of the magnetic ﬁeld induced
by an external magnet; S = πR2 is the ring area. One
of the consequences of the velocity quantization is the
Little-Parks eﬀect [2]. The |vs| tends towards a mini-
mum possible value. Therefore according to (3) the en-
ergy of superconducting state of a ring (or a tube) and,
as a consequence, the critical temperature of the ring

depend in a periodic manner on the magnetic ﬁeld value,
with period Φ0/S. The Little-Parks result [2] is the exper-
imental evidence of the velocity quantization phenomena
in superconductor. This phenomena is very important.
The existence of forbidden states in superconducting ring
means a possibility of a voltage induce by a change of the
ns value. Because the state with vs = 0 is forbidden if
the magnetic ﬂux contained within the ring is not divis-
ible by the ﬂux quantum the superconducting current Is
= sjs = s2ensvs is not equal zero and changes with a ns
change. Consequently, according to the Faraday’s law lE
= - dΦ/dt, a change of the superconducting pair density
induces a voltage

Here Φ = BS + LIs + LIn is the full magnetic ﬂux in-
side the ring; In is the normal current in the ring; In =
lE/Rn; Rn = lρn/s is the resistance of the ring in the
normal state. After a sharp change of the ns value the
voltage decreases during the decay time L/Rn. The ns
value can change in a consequence of a change of the ring
temperature. Thus, a small superconducting ring can be
used as a thermo-electric generator. In the present report
the most interesting case, an induction of direct voltage
in an inhomogeneous ring, is considered.

conducting ring with diﬀerent density of superconducting
pairs along the ring circumference the velocity has also
diﬀerent values. In the stationary state the normal cur-
rent is equal zero and the superconducting current Is =
sjs = s2ensvs should be constant along the circumference.
Consequently the velocity is higher in a section with lower
ns value. If a ring consists of two sections la and lb (la +
lb = l = 2πR) with the density of superconducting pairs
nsa and nsb the velocity (vsa and vsb) and the supercon-
ducting current in the permitted state according to (2)

Because the Is value depends on the superconducting pair
density of all ring section (see (8)) it can be changed by
a ns change in any ring section. The potential diﬀer-
ence dV/dl appears at an inhomogeneous change of the
ns value along the ring circumference. At an alternate
change of the ns value the average of the potential dif-
ference over a long time < dV /dl > is equal zero if ns
keeps a non-zero value in whole ring. But the < dV /dl >
value can be not equal zero if a ring section is switched
iteratively from the superconducting to normal state and
backwards.

According to (8) Is

6= 0 if nsa > 0, nsb > 0 and
Φ/Φ0 6= n. When (for example) the nsb value changes
from nsb = nb > 0 to nsb = 0 (at nsa = const > 0) the
potential diﬀerence Vb = RbnI appears on the ring sec-
tion lb and the current I decreases exponentially from the
initial value I = Is during the decay time L/Rbn. Because
the stationary state with Is = 0 is forbidden at nsa > 0,
nsb > 0 and Φ/Φ0 6= n the current in the ring increases
to I ≈ Is = (s2eh/m)(nsanb/(lanb+lbnsa))(n - Φ/Φ0) af-
ter the return of the lb section to the superconducting
state. A state with any integer number n is permitted.
But the state with a minimum | n - Φ/Φ0| value has the
greatest probability. Therefore the average of Is is not
equal zero at Φ/Φ0 6= n and Φ/Φ0 6= n + 0.5. The aver-
age < Vb > induced by the switching of the ring section
from the superconducting to normal state and backwards
is not equal zero also in this case.

If the energy diﬀerence between the lowest state with
n and the next state with n+1 is bigger than kBT and
tn ≫ L/Rbn, ts ≫ L/Rn then

the London penetration depth of the la section; f = 1/(ts
+ tn) is the frequency of the switching from the super-
conducting to the normal state. This result published in
[3,4] means that a small superconducting ring can be used
as direct-current generator [5] in which the heat energy
can be transformed to the electric energy of the direct
current.

If the temperature of the lb section changes iteratively
from Tmin = Tcb - ∆T to Tmax > Tcb a part of the heat
energy Q spent during a time t can be transformed in the
electric energy Ed.c. = tWd.c. = t < Vb(t)I(t) >t. The
eﬃciency Ef = Ed.c. /Q of such generator is

Ef =

Here Rl is the resistance of a load; cs = -T(dFGL/dT)
is the heat capacity of superconducting state; cs + cn =
cb is the whole heat capacity; µ/(1+µ) is the portion of
the magnetic energy EL = LI2
s /2 in whole change on the
superconductor energy. It has the maximum value µmax
b)(n-Φ/Φ0)2 at T = Tc. κ = λL/ξ is the
= (32π3/κ2)(Ls/l3
superconductor parameter introduced in the Ginzburg-
Landau theory. The maximum eﬃciency, at Rl ≪ Rb;
cn ≪ cs and µ ≫ 1, is corresponded to the eﬃciency Ef
= (1 - Tmin/Tmax) of the Carnot cycle considered ﬁrst in
1824 year.

Thus, the superconducting ring does not diﬀer qualita-
tively from any conventional heat engine if the switching
of the ring section from the superconducting to normal
state is caused by the temperature change. Its power is
very small. Therefore any application of such generator
would be senseless if the switching could be in the conse-
quence only of the T change. But this switching can take
place at an unaltered temperature in a consequence of the
thermal ﬂuctuation. If the ring section la and lb have dif-
ferent values of the critical temperature Tca > Tcb then
at an unaltered T ≈ Tcb, nsa > 0 always whereas the lb
section is switched by ﬂuctuation from the superconduct-
ing to normal state and backwards. The direct voltage
(9) should appear at both regular and chaotic switching.
But the switching to the superconducting state should be
simultaneous in whole section with lowest critical temper-
ature. This simultaneous switching in the consequence of
thermal ﬂuctuation takes place in a mesoscopic section
all sizes of which are not bigger than the superconducting
coherence length ξ. At T ≈ Tcb, the average resistance
Rb of the lb section Rbn > Rb = Rbntn/(ts + tn) > 0
because some times (tn) nsb = 0 (and therefore Rb =
Rbn) and some times (ts) nsb > 0 (and therefore Rb
= Rbn). Consequently, a direct voltage can appear in
a mesoscopic inhomogeneous superconducting ring at an
unaltered temperature corresponded to the resistive tran-
sition of the section with lowest Tc [3,4].

3. Possible Applications of Superconducting

Here ts and tn are duration of the superconducting and
normal states of the lb section; λL = (mc/4e2nsa)0.5 is

The direct voltage appeared in the consequence of the
thermal ﬂuctuation can be used. Therefore the supercon-
ducting ring can be considered as electric power source
in which the chaotic energy of thermal ﬂuctuation is
transformed to the direct current energy. The power
W =< Vb >2 Rl/(Rl + Rb)2 can develop across a load
with the resistance Rl. This power is obtained in a con-
sequence of a regulating of the chaotic energy of the ther-
mal ﬂuctuation.

3.1. LIMITING POWER OF FLUCTUATION EN-

ERGY REGULATING

Fundamental relation for limiting power of this regulat-
ing is determined by the characteristic energy of ﬂuctua-
tion kBT and a time of a cycle which can not be shorter
than ¯h/kBT because of the uncertainty relation. There-
fore W < (kBT )2/¯h in any case.

The power of one ring can not exceed

Wmax ≈

(11)

c (0)lbs)0.5 is the Ginzburg number;
Here Gi = (kBTc/H2
Hc(0) is the thermodynamic critical ﬁeld at T = 0. This
value is very small: at Tc = 100 K, (kBTc)22π/h ≈
10−8 Wt and 8πGiµ/(1+µ) value can not exceed 1 in
any ring. Therefore the power even of high-Tc super-
conducting ring can not exceed 10−8 Wt.
In order to
obtain an acceptable power a system with big number
of the rings should be used. The power W = N 2 <
Vb >2 Rl/(Rl + N Rb)2 developed across the load Rl can
be obtained by a system of N rings the sections of which
are connected in series. This power has maximum value
W = N < Vb >2 /4Rb at Rl = NRb. Because the power
< Vb >2 /Rb < 10−8 Wt at Tc = 100 K we should used
a system with 4 108 HTSC rings in order to obtain the
power 1 Wt.

Consequently in order to obtained the maximum pos-
sible power we should use HTSC rings with maximum
possible Giµ/(1+µ) value.

3.2. REQUIREMENTS TO SUPERCONDUCTING

RINGS AS DIRECT CURRENT GENERATOR

It is impossible now to give real optimum parameters
of the ring system aﬀording the maximum power of the
ﬂuctuation energy transformation. Additional theoreti-
cal and experimental investigations are necessary for this.
I list only basic requirements which follow from the the-
oretical consideration.

Because the ﬂuctuation induce the voltage in a narrow
temperature region near Tcb and µ has maximum value
at T = Tcb all rings of the system should have the same
critical temperature. A section of each ring should has
a lower critical temperature Tcb than Tca of other part
of the ring. Sizes of this section should be enough small.
They should not surpass considerably ξ/Gi3D. Here Gi3D

is the Ginzburg number of three-dimensional supercon-
ductor. The ξ/Gi3D value of known HTSC is very small.
Therefore methods of nano-technology are necessary for
the making of the ring system. The la section with higher
Tc can be longer considerably than lb. The µmax value
increases with la because the ring inductance L is propor-
tional to l. But the la should not be too long. At big la/lb
value the transition to the superconducting state of the
lb section becomes ﬁrst order if | n - Φ/Φ0| is not small
[3]. The ﬂuctuation can not switch the lb section from
the superconducting to normal state and backwards if las
is too big. I suppose the optimum diameter of HTSC ring
should be approximately 1 µm. The system of 108 rings
with diameter 1 µm can go in an area 1 cm2.

3.3.

POWER
SOURCE AND MICRO-REFRIGERATOR WITHOUT
EXPENSE OF AN EXTERNAL ENERGY

Although the power of the proposed direct-current gen-
erator is very weak and its making is very diﬃcult it
has optimistic perspective of application. The proposed
power source does not need an expense of an external en-
ergy. Moreover it can be used simultaneously as a micro-
refrigerator [6]. The chaotic heat energy is transformed
in the ordered electric energy in the proposed system of
superconducting rings. The ordered energy turns back
into the heat energy during an utilization. Therefore the
proposed power source can work anyhow long time with-
out an expence of any fuel. Such power source may be
especially useful in self-cotained systems.

4. Why the chaotic heat energy can be ordered

in a quantum system

The perspective of considered application is connected
with the possibility of the violation of the second law of
thermodynamics which should take place [7] if the result
published in [3,4] is correct. In a consequence of this cir-
cumstance most scientists can not believe that the result
[3,4] can be correct. Below I try to prove that the pro-
posed application of the HTSC rings can be real because
the second law of thermodynamics can be broken in a
quantum system.
I explain also why the voltage with
direct component can exist in the superconducting ring
section.

4.1. A QUANTUM FORCE

According to (9) the direct voltage < Eb >=< Vb >
/lb can be induced in the ring section by its iterative
switching from the superconducting to normal state and
backwards. Because

E = −∇V −

dA
dt

(12)

and

< E > dl =< Va > + < Vb >= − < dΦ

Hl
rect voltage < Ea >=< Va > /la = − < Vb > /la

consequently
dt >= 0 the di-

3

exists in the superconducting section la if it exists in the
switched section lb. The superconducting pair in the lb
section should accelerate continually (because mdvs/dt =
-eE) and consequently the result [3,4] can not be correct
if only electric force Fe = -eE acts on electrons. But if we
assumed this we would conclude that the Meissner eﬀect
is impossible. If 2mdvs/dt = -2eE then 2mdvs/dt + 2eE
= d(2mvs - 2eA/c)/dt = 0 and consequently the mvs-
eΦ/lc value should be constant in time. The magnetic
ﬂux should not change at the transition to the supercon-
ducting state. But the superconductivity is a macro-
scopic quantum phenomena. Therefore the supercon-
ducting state diﬀers from the state with inﬁnite conduc-
tivity. The superconducting pairs can accelerate against
the electric force at the transition to the superconduct-
ing state as it takes place at the Meissner eﬀect. Con-
sequently an additional force can act on the electrons
at the transition to the superconducting state. Because
this force is caused by the quantization of the electron
velocity I will call it as quantum force Fq.

The quantum force acts at the closing of the super-
conducting state in the ring. At the transition of the
lb section from normal nsb = 0 to superconducting state
with nsb = nsa the velocity changes from vs = 0 to vs =
(e/mcl)(nΦ0 - Φ) and the magnetic ﬂux inside the ring Φ
changes from Φ = BS to Φ = BS + LIs. The mvs- eΦ/cl
value changes by (e/cl)(nΦ0 - Φ) + (e/c)LIs = (e/cl)(1
+ sL/λ2
Ll)(nΦ0 - Φ). Consequently at this transition

The quantum force Fq acts only at the transition from
the normal to the superconducting state. At the transi-
tion of the lb section to the normal state the vs value in
the la section decreases in a consequence of the electric
force Fe = -eE. The electric ﬁeld E is induced by the de-
celeration of electrons in the lb section in a consequence of
the energy dissipation. Thus, the superconducting pairs
in the la section are accelerate by the quantum force Fq
and are retarded by electric force Fe at the switching of
the lb section. They are not accelerated continually be-
cause < Fq + Fe >= 0. The < Fe > is not equal zero at
the switching of the lb section because < Fq >6= 0.

4.2. VIOLATION OF THE SECOND LAW OF

THERMODYNAMIC

According to the Carnot’s principle (1824 year), which
may be considered as a ﬁrst formula of the second law of
thermodynamic, in the equilibrium state the heat energy
can not be transformed to a work. The transformation
of the ﬂuctuation energy to electric energy of the direct
current at an unaltered temperature considered above
contradicts to this principle. It contradicts also to the
Clausius’s formula of the second law of thermodynamic
(1850 year) if a temperature of the load is higher than the
ring temperature. It contradicts to the Thomson’s for-
mula (1850 year) if the load is an electricmotor. Never-
theless I state that the results [3,4] is correct because the

second law of thermodynamic can be broken in a quan-
tum system.
I understand it is very diﬃcult convince
anyone that this claim can be correct. Most persons are
fully conﬁdent that the second law of thermodynamic can
not be broken. Although few authors ﬁght against this
law (see [8]).Below I try to explaine because my claim is
correct.

R

The violation of the second law of thermodynamic
means that the heat energy can be transformed to the
work (in a regular energy) in the equilibrium thermo-
dynamic state. That is the work is posssible without
an expence of any fuel. Because the regular energy is
transformed to the chaotic heat energy at the work, the
work can be put out anyhow long time. The work is
F dX. Here F is an abstract force; X is an abstract
A =
F vdt. Conse-
coordinate. Because dX = vdt, A =
quently the violation of the second law of thermodynamic
R
T
means that the average value < F v >=
0 F vdt/T by
the inﬁnite time T can be not equal zero. Any closed
R
thermodynamic system has come to the equilibrium state
with maximum entropy during any time. Therefore the
average < F v > should be considered in the equilib-
rium state. In the last centure the second law of ther-
modynamic was interpreted as the impossipility of any
dynamic process in the equilibrium state. In this inter-
pretation < F v >= 0 because F = 0.

In the beginning of our century physicists have under-
stood that the dynamic processes take place in the equi-
librium state in a consequence of the ﬂuctuation. There-
fore the ﬂuctuation was considered as the breakdown of
the second law of thermodynamic in that time [9]. But
the ﬂuctuation dynamic process is chaotic. Therefore
< F v >=< F >< v > and the work is equal zero if
< F >= 0 or < v >= 0. In any conventional heat en-
gine the force F and the velocity v are correlated. This
correlation is achieved by an unequilibrium state. The
entropy S = Q/T increases at the work of a conven-
tional heat engine because the heat energy Q is trans-
ferred from a hot body with T1 to a cold body with
T2 during this process and ∆S = Q/T2 − Q/T1 > 0 if
T1 > T2. Numerous attempts to devise a correlated pro-
cess with < F v >6=< F >< v > in the equilibrium state
were unsuccessful for the present [8].

But the second law of thermodynamic can be broken
at < F v >=< F >< v > if < F >6= 0 and < v >6=
It is obvious that the motion should be circular in
0.
this case in order the work can be put out anyhow long
time. In any classical (no quantum) system < v >= 0
because all states are permitted. The probability of a
state P is proportional to exp-(E/kBT). The energy E of
a state is function of v2 in a consequence of the space
symmetry. Therefore the probability of the state with v
is equal the one with -v. Consequently < v >= 0 if all
states are permitted. In a quantum state no all states
are permitted. Therefore < v > can be not equal zero in
some quantum system. The superconducting ring with
Φ/Φ0 6= n and Φ/Φ0 6= n + 0.5 is one of such system.

At Φ/Φ0 6= n and Φ/Φ0 6= n + 0.5 the permitted states
with the opposite directed velocity have diﬀerent values
of the kinetic energy Ekin = mv2
s /2. For example at Φ/Φ0
=1/4 the lowest permitted velocities in a homogeneous
superconducting ring are equal vs = -h/ml4 at n=0 and
vs = 3h/ml4 at n=1. The kinetic energy of these states
diﬀer in 9 times. Therefore the thermodynamic average
of the velocity is not equal zero.

The average force < F > can be not equal zero at
the switching of the ring section from the superconduct-
ing to normal state and backwards because the quan-
tum force Fq acts at the closing of the superconducting
state if Φ/Φ0 6= n. This force acts in the same direction
(more exactly, has higher probability in one direction) if
Φ/Φ0 6= n + 0.5. This direction coincides with the veloc-
ity direction. Therefore < Fq >< v > > 0. This means
that a part of the ﬂuctuation energy can be ordered at
the closing of the superconducting state in the ring. In
order to switch the ring section to superconducting state
the ﬂuctuations should spend a energy Ekin = slnsmv2
s /2
for the acceleration of the superconducting electrons and
a energy EL = LI2
s /2 for the induce of the magnetic ﬂux
∆Φ = LIs of the superconducting current. This energy is
no chaotic because the velocity has higher probability in
one direction. The regulated energy is dissipated in the
lb section at its transition to the normal state. But we
can use a part of this energy for a work if we put load
a Rl on the voltage appeared on the lb section as it is
proposed above.

Thus, the new application of HTSC proposed in the
present work is real although it contradicts to the second
law of thermodynamic.

In 1992 M.W. Evans proposed a so-called O(3) symmetry of electromagnetic ﬁelds
Abstract.
by adding a constant longitudinal ghost ﬁeld to the well-known transversal plane em waves. Evans
considered this symmetry as a new law of electromagnetics. In 2000 he tried to show the Lorentz
invariance of O(3) symmetry of electromagnetic ﬁelds in this Journal [2]. However, this proof lacks
from a simple calculation error. As shall be shown below a correct calculation yields no Lorentz
invariance.
This result is of importance as later on, since 2002, this O(3) symmetry became the center of M.W.
Evans’ CGUFT which he recently renamed as ECE Theory. – A law of Physics must be invariant
under admissible coordinate transforms, namely under Lorentz transforms. Therefore, to check the
validity of M.W. Evans’ O(3) symmetry law, we apply a longitudinal Lorentz transform to M.W.
Evans’ plane em wave (the ghost ﬁeld included). As is well-known from SRT and recalled here the
transversal amplitude decreases while the additional longitudinal ﬁeld remains unchanged. Thus,
M.W. Evans’ O(3) symmetry cannot be invariant under (longitudinal) Lorentz transforms: M.W.
Evans’ O(3) symmetry is no valid law of Physics.

A law of Physics must be invariant under admissible coordinate transforms, namely under Lorentz
transforms. A plane wave remains a plane wave also when seen from arbitrary other inertial systems.
Therefore, Evans’ O(3) symmetry law should be valid in all inertial systems. Therefore to check the
validity of Evans’ O(3) symmetry law in other inertial systems, we apply a longitudinal Lorentz trans-
form to Evans’ plane em wave (the ghost ﬁeld included). As is well–known from SRT and recalled
here the transversal amplitude decreases while the additional longitudinal ﬁeld remains unchanged.
Thus, Evans’ O(3) symmetry cannot be invariant under (longitudinal) Lorentz transforms: Evans’
O(3) symmetry is not a valid law of Physics.

In the following text quotations from M.W. Evans’ GCUFT book [1] appear with
equation labels [1.nn] at the left margin.

1. M.W. Evans’ O(3) hypothesis

The assertion of O(3) symmetry is a central concern of M.W. Evans’ considerations
since 1992: He claims that each plane circularly polarized electromagnetic wave B is
accompanied by a constant longitudinal ﬁeld B(3), a so-called ”ghost ﬁeld”.

Evans considers a circularly polarized plane electromagnetic wave propagating in z-
direction, cf. [1; Chap.1.2] . Using the electromagnetic phase

satisfying M.W. Evans’ ”cyclic O(3) symmetry relations”

Especially equ.[1.43/3] deﬁnes M.W. Evans’ ghost ﬁeld B(3), which is coupled by the
relations [1.44] with the transversal B components given by the two eqns.[1.43/1-2].
Evans’ B Cyclic Theorem is the statement that each plane circularly polarized wave
[1.43/1-2] is accompanied by a longitudinal ﬁeld [1.43/3], and the associated ﬁelds fulﬁl
the Cyclic equations [1.44]. Evans considers this O(3) hypothesis as a Law of Physics.

2. Checking the Lorentz invariance of the O(3) hypothesis

In the article [2; p.14] M.W. Evans therefore tries to prove the Lorentz invariance
of the O(3) hypothesis [1.44] by referring to the invariance of the vector potential A
under Lorentz transforms. That is a good method obtaining the transform of ED ﬁelds
if one calculates correctly.

So the reader should ﬁrst check that the vector potentials of the transversal components
B(1) and B(2) of the plane wave under consideration are given by

(2.1)

A(1) =

B(1) =

while the vector potential of the longitudinal ﬁeld B(3) is

The invariance of the vector potential A(3) yields the invariance of B(3) as well for
longitudinal Lorentz transforms between inertial frames K, K ′ where K ′ moves relative
to K with velocity v

What M.W. Evans has obviously ignored in [2]: Frequency ω and wave number κ are
no invariants. Under longitudinal Lorentz transforms we have the well-known Doppler

Therefore the invariance of the vector potentials doesn’t transfer to the transversal
ﬁeld components B(1) and B(2).

Due to the invariance of A we obtain from (2.1)

i.e. the expression B(1)
B(2) at the left hand side of [1.44/1] does not remain invariant
while B(3) is invariant due to (2.2). Hence equ.[1.44/1], if valid in the inertial system
K, cannot be valid also in the inertial system K ′: Evans’ cyclical symmetry [1.44] is
not Lorentz invariant and so cannot be a Law of Physics.

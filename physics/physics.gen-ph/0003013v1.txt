Abstract

The physical model (PhsMdl) of the hadrons is oﬀered by means of the obvious analogy
with the transparent surveyed PhsMdls of the vacuum and leptons in our recent works.
It is assumed that the vacuum is consistent by dynamides, streamlined in junctions of
some tight crystalline lattice. Every dynamide contains a neutral pair of massless con-
trary point-like (PntLk) elementary electric charges (ElmElc Chrgs): electrino (−) and
positrino (+). By means of the existent fundamental analogy between their properties
and behaviour we can understand the similarity and diﬀerence between them and assume
that the quark parameter aroma is determined by the value of its size of its circular two-
dimensional motion, while the quark parameter colour is determined by orientation of the
ﬂat of the same circular two-dimensional motion in the space. The colorless of the barions
is explained by distribution of the same circular two-dimensional motion of its elementary
electric charge within three mutually perpendicular ﬂats. Then the exchange of the colors
between two quarks with diﬀerent colors within some hadron can be interpretated as some
twisting of same hadron in the space. We give a new obvious physical interpretation of
the charge values of quarks, which gives some explanation of angles of Cabibo and Weyn-
berg. By some physical supposition about the structure of charged intermediate vector
bozon W and uncharged intermediate vector bozon Z we have possibility to explain as
the physical essence of the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions, so the outline
of all births, transformations and decays of the ElmPrts.

Although up to the present nobody of scientists distinctly knows are there some elementary
micro particles (ElmMicrPrts) as a stone of the micro world and what the elementary micro
particle (ElmMicrPrt) means, there exists an essential possibility for clear and obvious scientiﬁc
consideration of the unusual behaviour of the quantized micro particles (QntMicrPrts). It is well
known that the physical model (PhsMdl) presents at us as an actual ingradient of every good
physical theory. It may be used as for an obvious visual teaching the occurred physical processes
within the investigated phenomena, so for doing with them a bigger capacity of its physical
understanding and mathematical description. All scientists think that the ElmMicrPrt display
itself as united and indivisible everywhere and always, but nobody demand for ElmMicrPrt
to have no structure. About thirty years ago in the early theory of the ElmMicrPrt some
theoretical physicists assumed that all the ElmMicrPrts have point-like (PntLk)-fashion and
their behaviour are no dependent on the presence of other ElmMicrPrt as neighbors. In further
it was turned out that the existence of the strong interaction between hadrons and of their own
magnetic dipole moment (MgnDplMmn) is caused by existence and exchange of the virtual
pions between them. Really, the strong interaction between nearest hadrons is provided by the

1

electromagnetic interaction, which is transferred by frequent exchanging a virtual charged pion
(π±-meson). The virtual charged pions (π±-mesons), owing of its smallest mass between all
other mesons, are most probable for a frequent birth from all other virtual ElmMicrPrts, which
are caused by exchanged gluon within the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld (QntElcMgnFld).

We can assume without restriction that if the ﬁne spread (FnSpr) elementary electric charge
(ElmElcChrg) of every charged lepton participates in isotropic three-dimensional (IstThrDmn)
relativistic quantized Schrodinger (RltQntSchr) self-consistent strong-correlated (SlfCnsStrCrr)
solitary fermion vortical harmonic oscillations (SltFrmVrtHrmOscs) within its volume, then the
FnSpr ElmElcChrg of every charged hadron participates successive in three anisotropic two-
dimensional (AnIstTwoDmn) relativistic quantized (RltQnt) self-consistent strong-correlated
(SlfCnsStrCrr) solitary fermion circular harmonic oscillations (SltFrmCrcHrmOscs) within its
volume. If the RltQntSchr SlfCnsStrCrr SltFrmVrtHrmOscs can be approximately described
by the orbital wave function (OrbWvFnc) of s-state ItsThrDmnNrlQnt boson harmonic oscil-
lator (BsnHrmOsc), the AnIstTwoDmn RltQnt SlfCnsStrCrr FrmCrcHrmOscs can be approxi-
mately described by OrbWvFnc of p-state of AnIstThrDmn NrlQnt boson harmonic oscillator
(BsnHrmOsc). Therefore we can assume that if the averaged FnSpr ElmElcChrg of charged
lepton has one maximum, then the averaged FnSpr ElmElcChrg of charged hadron has three
maximums, which can be identiﬁed as three FnSpr ElmElcChrgs of three quarks. But in a
reality their is only one FnSpr ElmElcChrg within every charged hadron, which is determined
by electric interaction only with the FnSpr ElmElcChrg of one maximum at a dispersion of
passing charged leptons.
Indeed, at every dispersion of some FnSpr ElmElcChrg of leptons
from every hadron the FnSpr ElmElcChrg electromagnetically interacts (ElcMgnIntAct) only
by one maximum of FnSpr ElmElcChrg of same hadron.

The existence of essential analogy between leptons and hadrons allows us to assume that
the quarks for the hadrons are analogous of the neutrinos for the leptons. Therefore the phys-
ical means of the aroma of the quarks is analogous of the physical means of the aroma of the
neutrinos, which is determined by the sizes of the vortical harmonic excitation of the neutral
but ﬂuctuating vacuum (FlcVcm). Because of that we can suppose that if the neutrino is an
isotropic three dimensional solitary vortical excitation of a spherical symmetry of the neutral
vacuum, then the quark is a two-dimensional ﬂat circular soliton excitation of cylindrical sym-
metry of the same neutral vacuum. But if all the neutrino are very stable excitation without
elementary electric charge (ElmElcChrg) and have unlimited time of live, all the quarks are
unstable without ElmElcChgr and have limited time of live. Moreover we may assume also
that if within some massive lepton (electron, muon (µ-meson), tauon (τ -meson)) its point-like
(PntLk) ElmElcChrg takes part simultaneously in three one-dimensional very strongly corre-
lated self-consistent fermion vortical harmonic oscillations along three axes, orientired mutually
perpendicular one to another in the space, then within some massive charged hadron its PntLk
ElmElcChrg or within other massive ,,uncharged” hadron its two opportunity PntLk ElmEl-
cChrgs, take part successive in three two-dimensional very strongly correlated self-consistent
fermion circular harmonic oscillations along three planes, orientired mutually perpendicular one
to another in the space. Therefore we may naturally assume that three colours of the quark
state correspond to three planes of motion of the PntLk ElmElcChrg, orientired mutually per-
pendicular one to another in the space.

If the lepton state of its PntLk ElmElcChrg is determined by one spherical state, describing
the self- consist motion (Zitterbewegung) of its PntLk ElmElcChrg by one s-OrbWvFnc, then
the hadron state of its PntLk ElmElcChrg is determined by three ﬂat states, describing its
three dimension motion, composed by three ﬂat cylindrical harmonic motions by three p-

2

OrbWvFnc. Moreover, each p-state correspond to one quark state with one of three colours.
Therefore the physical incomprehencible demand about colourless of the hadrons obtains quite
obvious and clear physical interpretation about the demand of the spherical symmetry of three
mutual perpendicular orientated ﬂats of two-dimensional fermion circular harmonic oscillations
in our PhsMdl. The change of the quark colour of the PntLk ElmElcChrg ﬂat circular harmonic
motion occurs through emission or absorption of some gluon (δ). When the PntLk ElmElcChrg
of some hadron, moving within quark of some colour, absorbs some gluon (a quantized quasi-
plane magnetic ﬁeld), then this quarks changes his colour and the hadron as whole twists the
ﬂat of the two-dimensional fermion circular harmonic oscillations of his PntLk ElmElcChrg.

In the beginning for an explanation of the existent experimental date some theoretical
physicists suppose that there are only three quarks and the same number antiquarks. But
for physical explanation of new experimental date which are obtained during the carrying the
following experiments, the scientists had need from new three quarks and the same number
antiquarks. There are a common agreement that the existence of six quark (d,u,s,c,b,t) and the
same number antiquark ( ˜d, ˜u, ˜s, ˜c, ˜b, ˜t) is ﬁrmly determined by experimental research. Coming
out from the supposed symmetry between leptons and quarks some theoretical physicists very
frequently suppose a following list of their distribution on aroma:

Indeed, we can suppose that owing of the strong localization of the PntLk ElmElcChrg of
any massive hadron allow one to participate in very high frequency oscillations within very
small area of the space, what secures the obtaining its QntElcMgnFld with very high electric
and magnetic intensities and very dense electromagnetic energy, which same FnSpr ElmElcChrg
borrows from the FlcVcm at its electromagnetic interaction with it by stochastic exchanging
the virtual photons (VrtPhtns). Then it is obviously that the existence of the QntElcMgnFld
with very high electric and magnetic intensities and very dense electromagnetic energy can
secures the need probability for frequently births of virtual charged pions pairs within the
immediate neighborhood of the PntLk ElmElcChrg’s position. Therefore we mast suppose that
the interacting hadrons are very quite near one to others. At these conditions we may suppose
also that when some hadron (for example some proton) takes place in some nucleus and has as
neighbors other hadrons with other isotopic spin (neurtons) then during the time of the motion
of its PntLk ElmElcChrg within some u quark without changing its color, the hadron is visited
by negative charged virtual pion (π−-meson), emitted by neighbor neutrons. Then both the
free u-quark from the proton and the u-antiquark (¯u- quark) annihilated and negative PntLk
ElmElcChrg shifts from its d-quarks to the free d-quarks of the visited proton. After some
time some gluon from FlcVcm generates another pair of u-quark and u-antiquark with another
colour from the ﬂuctuating vacuum (FlcVcm). Then the negative PntLk ElmElcChrg shifts
itself from d-quark of the visited proton on the new born u-antiquark, which together with
the d-quark of the old transferring negative charged pion (π−-meson) build a new negative
charged pion.
In the time of such a visit the positive PntLk ElmElcChrg uninterruptedly
participated within the ﬂat two-dimensional fermion circular harmonic oscillations within the
u-quark of the visited proton. After the departure of the negative PntLk ElmElcChrg from
the new neutron the positive PntLk ElmElcChrg shifts into the new born u-quark, which have
the colour, diﬀerent from the colour of old quark, from which it left. After such an exchange

3

twisted proton is ready for a new visit from another negative virtual pion (π−- meson).
In
such a natural way the exchange of the negative virtual pion between some pair of proton and
neutron causes the existence of the strong interaction.

If the three diﬀerent aroma of leptons correspond to three diﬀerent sizes of the isotropic three
dimensional relativistic quantized (IstThrDmnRltQnt) Schrodinger self-consistent strongly cor-
related (SchrSlfCnsStrCrr) solitary fermion vortical harmonic oscillations (SltFrmVrtHrmOscs)
of its FnSpr ElmElcChrg, composed by three SlfCnsStrCrr one-dimensional relativistic quan-
tized harmonic oscillations, then the three diﬀerent aroma of hadron quark state correspond
to three sizes of three two-dimensional relativistic quantized fermion circular harmonic oscilla-
tions of its FnSpr ElmElcChrg. Therefore we may suppose that if within the massive lepton its
averaged (over spread (OvrSpr)) ElmElcChrg has one maximum only, then within the massive
hadron its averaged OvrSpr ElmElcChrg has three maximums only, each of which may be iden-
tiﬁed by us as the ElcChrg of the quark or parton. The exchange of the FnSpr ElmElcChrg of
its quark colour state occurs through absorption or emission of some gluon (δ).

The gluons are hypothetical particle, which exchange between two quarks with diﬀerent
colors (space orientations) achieve the strong interaction between them.
It is turn out that
they have not a ElmElcChrg and rest mass, but have a proper mechanical moment (spin) and
quantized magnetic ﬁeld with a proper magnetic dipole moment (MgnDplMmn). Therefore in
magnetic interaction (MgnIntAct) between the QntMgnFlds of the gluon and quarks ensures
the turn of space orientation (change of color) of gluon. It is turn that the impulse (mechanical
momentum) sum of all gluons within some hadron is equal of the impulse sum of all quarks
within same hadron. As the gluon spin is 1¯h, therefore at its habitual virtual decay within
hadron one can turn into pair virtual quark and antiquark with paralel spins. But such a
virtual pair is no virtual meson, as more mesons with small mass have a spin with a zero value.
Therefore such a decay of some gluon into a pair of some virtual quark and antiquark could
eﬀectively turn upsite-down the spin of one of meson quark and in such a way enssure the decay
of this meson in ﬁrst into charged intermediate vector bozon W and in second into massive
and massless leptons of equal aromas. The behavior of eight gluons can be described by eight
Gell-Man’s mathrices of SU(3) space.

We must note that the PntLk ElmElcChrg of the charged admeson is moving successively in
two opposite orientated ﬂats. As in positive π-meson its positive PntLk ElmElcChrg (positrino)
is successively moving in an u-quark state and in a ˜d-antiquark state, which have an opposite
parallel orientations, then in negative π-meson its negative PntLk ElmElcChrg (electrino) is
successively moving in a d-quark state and in a ˜u -antiquark state, which have opposite parallel
orientations.
In same way in the positive K-meson its positive massless PntLk ElmElcChrg
(positrino) is successively moving in an u quark state and in a ˜s-antiquark state, which have
opposite parallel orientations, and in the negative K-meson its negative PntLk ElmElcChrg
(electrino) is successively moving in a s-quark state and in a ˜u-antiquark state, which have
opposite parallel orientations. However in the neutral admesons two opposite charged PntLk
ElmElcChrgs (electrino and positrino) are moving in four ﬂats, which have in pair opposite
parallel orientations, where are moving separately two opposite charged PntLk ElmElcChrgs.
For instance in πo-meson its massless electrino is moving in d-quark state and in ˜u-antiquark
state, which both have opposite parallel orientations, and its positrino is moving in u quark state
and in ˜d antiquark state, which both have opposite parallel orientations, mutually perpendicular
orientated to the ﬁrst pair ﬂats. In such a fashion in K o -meson its electrino is moving in a
d quark state and in a ˜u-antiquark state, which both have opposite parallel orientations, and
its positrino is moving in an u quark state and in ˜s antiquark state, which both have opposite

4

parallel orientations, but the second are mutual perpendicular oriented to the ﬁrst pair ﬂats
of moving electrino. In such a fashion in ˜K o- meson its electrino is moving in a s-quark state
and in a ˜u antiquark state, which both have opposite parallel orientations, and its positrino
is moving in an u quark state and in a ˜d-antiquark state, which both have opposite parallel
orientations, but the second are mutual perpendicular oriented to ﬁrst pair ﬂats of moving
electrino. Owing of a small diﬀerence between the compositions of quarks, from which are built
the K o-meson and the ˜K o-meson the some ﬂuctuations in the FlcVcm have energy, enough for
their conversion one meson in its antimeson.
K o( d ↑ , ˜s ↓ ) = ( u ↓ , W − ↑ , ˜s ↓ ) = ( u ↓ , ˜c ↑ ) = ( s ↑ , W + ↓ , ˜c ↑ ) = ˜K o( s ↑ , ˜d ↓ ) (2)
In a result of such mutual conversions are obtained short-lived and long-lived K o-mesons

with diﬀerent parameters and scheme of decay.

The similar fashion of the meson construction we may ﬁnd in the Do-mesons, where its
positive PntLk ElmElcChrg is successively moving in an u-quark state and in a ˜d-antiquark
state, which both have opposite parallel orientations, and its negative PntLk ElmElcChrg is
successively moving in a d-quark state and in a ˜c-antiquark state, which both have opposite
parallel orientations, but the second are mutually perpendicular to ﬁrst pair ﬂats. In such a
fashion in ˜Do-meson its electrino is moving in a d-quark state and in a ˜u-antiquark state, which
both have opposite parallel orientations, and its positrino is moving in a c quark state and in a
˜d-antiquark state, which both have opposite parallel orientations, but the second are mutually
perpendicular to ﬁrst pair ﬂats.
Do( u ↑ , ˜c ↓ ) = ( d ↓ , W + ↑ , ˜c ↓ ) = ( d ↓ , ˜s ↑ ) = ( c ↑ , W − ↓ , ˜s ↑ ) == ˜Do( c ↑ , ˜u ↓ ) (4)
As for the radiation of the spontaneous real photon (RlPhtn) from the excitative atom it
is necessary the presence of the virtual photon (VrtPhtn) for the creation of the electric dipole
moment (ElcDplMm), so for the decay of a charged π-meson it is necessary the presence of a
virtual gluon for an overturning of the spin of one of its quarks, by which charged π-meson
turns into charged virtual ρ-meson, which can immediately decay into charged intermediate
vector boson W . At the subsequent transfer of the in a pair of massive and massless leptons of
equal aroma the participating in the decay gluon go back in the FlcVcm. Indeed, I think that
instead of the equations of the incomprehencible decay :

π+ =⇒ W + =⇒ µ+ + νµ
π− =⇒ W − =⇒ µ− + ˜νµ

π+ =⇒ W + =⇒ e+ + νe

π− =⇒ W − =⇒ e− + ˜νe

gluon δ in decay of the πo-meson. For certain of that the half-life time (τ +
of the charged π-mesons is very diﬀerent from the half-life time (τ o
neutral π-mesons.

As it is easy to see from eqns.(15) and (16) that there is no necessity for participating some
π = 2.6 × 10−8s)
π = 8.3 × 10−17s) of the
It seems to me the existance of two very interesting facts, having common physical cause.The
ﬁrst is concurrence of the energy of one degree of freedom in charged lepton µ-meson and in
charged admeson π-meson. Indeed, if in isotropic three dimensional solitary vortical harmonic
ocsillations of FnSpr ElmElcChrg of µ-meson have three degrees of freedom and therefore
3 ¯h ω = 2 m C 2 = 213.2Mev. Hence the energy of one degree of freedom can be determined
¯h ω
2 = 35.5Mev. If we take into consideration that the FnSpr ElmElcChrg of π-meson takes
participation in two quasi-plane circular harmonic oscillations with opportunity orientations
and therefore has energy 2¯hω = 139.6Mev. Hence the energy of one degree of freedom can be
determined ¯h ω
2 = 34.9Mev. As we can see by comparision of two results this coincidence is very
accurate. On this reason we can assume that the areas of their oscillations must also coincidence
and therefore the OrbWvFnc of both FnSpr ElmElcChrg. May be therefore the decay of the
positive (negative) charged π-meson in 100% occurs through the positive (negative) µ-meson
and µ-neutrino (antineutrino) as we can see from (5, 6, 11, 12). This second coincidence gives
us many correct answer of the question for inner structure of the elementary micro particles
(ElmMicrPrts).

It is useful to remember that the existence of some analogy between leptons and hadrons
allows us to assume that the quarks for the hadrons are analogous of the neutrinos for the
leptons. Therefore the physical means of the aroma of the quarks is analogous of the physical
means of the aroma of the neutrinos, which determines the sizes of the type excitation of
the neutral but ﬂuctuating vacuum (FlcVcm). Because of that we can suppose that if the
neutrino is three dimensional spherical soliton seclusion excitation of the neutral vacuum, then
the quark is the sum of two two-dimensional ﬂat soliton excitation of same neutral vacuum.
As the vacuum is formed by neutral dynamides, which are made from two contrary massless
electric charges ((-) electrino and (+) positrino) through their dense streamlining, then its
solution seclusion oscillation secures the joint motion of the oscillating FlcVcm and the PntLk

6

ElmElcChrg. However if the neutrino can accept the PntLk ElmElcChrg for an unlimited time
at a creation of the massive lepton, then the quark can accept the PntLr ElmElcChrg only for
a limited time t or 2t at every its visit, after which the PntLk ElmElcChrg must leave it and
go on to another quark. In this a way every PntLk ElmElcChrg in every hadron continuously
and alternately changes the quarks of the hadron, in which it temporary pass into. Therefore
as we could see the average distribution of the spread electric charge, we think that the electric
charge of one type quark is 1e
3 . The time of
pass τ or 2τ of the PntLk ElmElcChrg within some quark area is determined in depending on
the kind (symmetric or antisymmetric) of the neutral ﬂat vortical oscillation of the FlcVcm.
So any ﬂat oscillation can be presented as a sum of two diﬀerent ﬂat oscillations, orientated in
opposite directions. Therefore two kind of the quarks could be presented as symmetrical and
antisymmetrical sums of two one-sided orientated protoquarks |P K| and other-sided orientated
antiprotoquark |AP K| :

Hence the angle θo determine the ratio of the participation of two oscillations. This inter-
pretations help us to understand the physical mean of number 1
3. Indeed, if the |SC|
means the symmetric combination of two opposite orientated oscillations then the probability
to ﬁnd the PntLk ElcChrg in this state is determined by the diﬀerence of the quadrats of its
amplitudes 3
2. Then, if the
|ASC| means the antisymmetric combination of two opposite orientated oscillations then the
probability to ﬁnd the PntLk ElcChrg in this state is determined by sum of the quadrats of
its amplitudes 3
4 = 1. Consequently
the number 1
3 mean that the probability of ﬁnding the PntLk ElmElcChrg
in the state of the SC is 1
3 and the probability of ﬁnding the PntLk ElmElcChrg in the state of
the ASC is 2

By means of this our interpretation of our PhsMdl we can obtain the real values of the
Weinberg angle and of the Cabibo angle. Indeed, in the probability of the ﬁnding the PntLk
ElmElcChrg in the d quark state is equal of 1
3 and the probability of the ﬁnding same PntLk
ElmElcChrg in the u quark state is equal of 2
3, then it is obviously clearly that the transition
probability from one kind of the quark to another kind of quark is equal of their product.

Therefore we have obtained that sin(θw)2 = 2
or θw = 28o 8, .

In such a naturally easy, physically substantiated and mathematically correct way we have
achieved Weinberg’s angle values, which very well coincides with its value, determined by the
experiment. It is very important that the value, ˜θw = 38o , which is determined by means of
the SU(2) × SU(1) group method, is very diﬀerent from the experimental value.

We have explained that besides the colour the quark state has also the aroma, which dif-
ference ensures perfectly diﬀerent properties of the quark state. We have supposed, that three
diﬀerent aroma of the quark correspond to three sizes of the two-dimensional ﬂat fermion har-
monic oscillations of its PntLk ElmElcChrg. It turns out that there are possibility enough to
give us clear physical interpretation and mathematical substantiation for obtaining the Cabibo
angle value, determined by experiment. Indeed, we may assume, that in a result of the diﬀerent
cover of the OrbWvFncs of diﬀerent aroma of quarks, there will be diﬀerent possibility for a
transition of one aroma of quark in another aroma of quark with same ClcChrg. Some times
this possibility is interpreted as a reﬂection of some mutual inﬂuence between them. Therefore
we may assume that each quark is consists from quarks of diﬀerent aroma but of same ElcChrg.
In this supposing we may roughly write the following equations :

d1 = do cos α + so sin α ; s1 = so cos α − do sin α ;
u1 = uo cos β + co sin β ; c1 = co cos β − uo sin β ;

It is easy to verify that :

9 and θc = arcsin 2

9 = 12o 50,.

˜u1 d1 + ˜c1 s1 = (˜uo do + ˜co so ) cos(α − β) + (˜uo so − ˜co do ) sin(α − β) ;
˜u1 s1 − ˜c1 d1 = (˜uo so − ˜co do ) cos(α − β) − (˜uo do + ˜co so ) sin(α − β) ;

If we present the diﬀerence (α − β) as Cabibo angle θc then from eqns. (21) and (22)
one becomes clear that at the participation of the quarks of equal aroma (˜u1 d1 + ˜c1 s1) and
diﬀerent aroma (˜u1 s1 − ˜c1 d1) in the weak interaction reaction, then Cabibo angle determines
the decay probabilities with the hypercharge change and hypercharge conservation. Therefore
Cabibo angle value is determined by equation sin θc = 2
In
such a naturally, physically clear and mathematically substantiated way we have easy achieved
Cabibo angle value 12.84o which very well coincides with the value 12.7o , determined by the
experiment.

We assume that the proton is composed from one free positive PntLk ElmElcChrg, which
visits consecutively two states of u-quark.The free u-quark and the ˜d-antiquark are frequently
visited by negative PntLk ElmElcChrg of virtual negative charged π−-mesons and the neutron
is composed from two free opposite charged PntLk ElmElcChrgs, the positive one is oscillating
in a state of u-quark and the negative one is oscillating in a state of two d-quarks. Very
frequently the negative PntLk ElmElcChrg after forming the virtual negative charged point
(π−-meson) by means of birthed pair of u-quark and ˜u-antiquark owing of an absorption of
some virtual gluon. The birthed by this way virtual negative pion can participate in strong
interaction between very close neighbor proton and neutron by its exchanging.

However I have possibility to show and you to understand by means of some decay relation
that negative charged intermediate vectorial boson W − has spin minus ¯h,and the positive
charged intermediate vectorial boson W + have a spin ¯h, while the neutral intermediate vectorial
boson Z o have a spin zero ¯h. Therefore the PntLk ElmElcChrg during the exchange of its
self-consistent motions within one ElmMicrPrt and within other ElmMcrPrt transfers in a
form of charged intermediate vectorial boson W . Indeed, the observing the law of total spin
conservation at all decay with participating the weak interaction, when the PntLk ElmElcChrg
takes the form of the charged intermediate vector boson W ±, causes fulﬁllment of some strong
selection rules from all ElmMicrPrt. The consideration of spins of the quarks and charged
intermediate vector bozon W allow us to understand why the positive charged intermediate

vectorial boson W + emits only right quarks and selects only left quarks for participating with
them in a weak interacting, while the negative charged intermediate vectorial boson W − emits
only left quarks and selects only right quarks for participating with them in a weak interaction.
The neutral intermediate vector boson Z o don’t select the polarization of the quarks with which
it participate in the weak interaction.

The weak interaction performs an important role in the relation between hadrons and leptons
as it is display in nuclear β decay. Indeed, it is possible some a negative PntLk ElmElcChrg
(electrino) of any neutron, which takes part within the oscillations of d-quark, to change its self-
consistent motion and moves on the oscillations of ˜u-quark, which are unstable and therefore
it decay in a negative charged intermediate vector boson W − and u-quark. In such a naturally
way the neutron transforms itself in proton and the residual the negative charged intermediate
vector boson W − after its incorporation with some new created electron neutrino νe form the
electron, while the other new created antineutrino ˜νe go a free away. When some positive
PntLk ElmElcChrg (positrino) of any proton, which takes part in the oscillations of the u-
quark, changes his self-consistent motion and moves on the oscillations of the ˜d-quark, which
are unstable and therefore it decay in positive charged intermediate vector boson W + and d-
quark. In such a naturally way the proton transforms itself in a neutron and the residual the
positive charged intermediate vector boson W + after its incorporation with some new created
electron antineutrino ˜νe form the positron, while the other new created neutrino νe go a free
away. Therefore the described β-transitions can be written in the following form :

n(u, d, d) = p(u, u, d) + W − = p(u, u, d) + e− + ˜νe
p(u, u, d) = n(u, d, d) + W + = n(u, d, d) + e+ + νe

As within the areas of every nucleon there are two virtual opposite charged π-mesons, at
decreasing the distance between nucleons begins the creation of some correlation between their
motions, which creates some decreasing of their total energy. At a rather decreasing of the
distance between the nucleons begins some collectivization of all virtual charged π-meson. In
this way we understand that internucleonic forces are analogous of interatomic Van-der- Waals
force between neutral atoms.

Our PhsMdls explain as the structure of hadrons and the nature of their interaction so
the existence of a possibility for joint description of a ﬁeld and substantial form of the matter
as unity whole in the physical science, which are submitted to an united, fundamental and
invariable laws of nature.

As all existent ElmMicrPrts are excitement of the vacuum then all of them will move freely
through one without any damping, that is to say without to feel the existence of the vacuum.
Moreover, the existence of some McrPrt in the vacuum twists its cristalline lattice.This twist of
the neutral vacuum excites the gravitation ﬁeld of the ElmMicrPrt’s mass, which will inﬂuence
by using of some force upon mass of another ElmMicrPrt and upon its behaviour.

We can understand the physical essence of the hadrons and their structure and charac-
teristics on these obvious representations. Our physical model explains as the structure of
hadrons and the nature of their three type of interactions, so the existence of the possibil-
ity for a joint description of a ﬁeld and substantial form of the matter as unity whole in the
physical science, which are submitted to an united, fundamental and invariable laws of nature.
By this natural way we can see the unity of the ﬁeld charged and neutral excitations within
the vacuum and its substantial charged excitations, oﬀered by modernity relativistic quantum
mechanics (RltQntMch), quantum electrodynamics (QntElcDnm) and quantum theory of ﬁeld
(QntThrFld).

I cherish the hope that this consideration of my physical model of the hadrons from my
new point of view will be of great interest for all scientists. My very quality and good inter-
pretation of behaviour and structure of hadrons and their interactions with its corresponding
experimentally determined values gives us the hope for correctness of our beautiful, simple and
preposterous physical model of hadrons and ﬁne,extraordinary ideas,which have been inserted
at its construction.

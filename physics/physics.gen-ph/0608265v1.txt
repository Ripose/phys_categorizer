Abstract

The electromagnetic component waves, comprising together with their gen-
erating oscillatory massless charge a material particle, will be Doppler shifted
when the charge hence particle is in motion, with a velocity v, as a mere me-
chanical consequence of the source motion. We illustrate here that two such
component waves generated in opposite directions and propagating at speed c
between walls in a one-dimensional box, superpose into a traveling beat wave of
wavelength Λd= ( v
c )Λ and phase velocity c2/v + v which resembles directly L.
de Broglie’s hypothetic phase wave. This phase wave in terms of transporting
the particle mass at the speed v and angular frequency Ωd = 2πv/Λd, with Λd
and Ωd obeying the de Broglie relations, represents a de Broglie wave. The
standing-wave function of the de Broglie (phase) wave and its variables for par-
ticle dynamics in small geometries are equivalent to the eigen-state solutions to
Schr¨odinger equation of an identical system.

Introduction

As it stood at the turn of the 20th century, M. Planck’s quantum theory suggested
that energy (ε) is associated with a certain periodic process of frequency (ν), ε = hν;
and A. Einstein’s mass-energy relation suggested the total energy of a particle (ε) is
connected to its mass (m), ε = mc2. Planck and Einstein together implied that mass
was associated with a periodic process mc2 = hν, and accordingly a larger ν with a
moving mass. Incited by such a connection but also a clash with this from Einstein’s
relativity theory which suggested a moving mass is associated with a slowing-down
clock and thus a smaller ν, L. de Broglie put forward in 1923 [1] a hypothesis that
a matter particle (moving at velocity v) consists of an internal periodic process
describable as a packet of phase waves of frequencies dispersed about ν, having a
phase velocity W = ν
k = c2/v, with c the speed of light, and a group velocity of

the phase-wave packet equal to v. Despite the hypothetic phase wave appeared
supernatural and is today not held a standard physics notion, the de Broglie wave
has proven in modern physics to depict accurately the matter particles, and the de
Broglie relations proven their fundamental relations.

So inevitably the puzzles with the de Broglie wave persist, involving the hy-
pothetic phase waves or not, and are unanswered prior to our recent uniﬁcation
work[2]: What is waving with a de Broglie wave and more generally Schr¨odinger’s
wave function? If de Broglie’s phase wave is indeed a reality, what is then trans-
mitted at a speed (W ) being c
v times the speed of light c? How is the de Broglie
(phase) wave related to the particle’s charge, which if accelerated generates accord-
ing to Maxwell’s theory electromagnetic (EM) waves of speed c, and how is it in turn
related to the EM waves, which are commonplace emitted or absorbed by a particle
which changes its internal state? In [2] we showed that a physical model able to
yield all of the essential properties of a de Broglie particle, in terms of solutions in
a uniﬁed framework of the three basic mechanics, is provided by a single harmonic
oscillating, massless charge +e or
e (termed a vaculeon) and the resulting elec-
tromagnetic waves. The solutions for a basic material particle generally in motion,
with the charge quantity (accompanied with a spin) and energy of the charge as the
sole inputs, predict accurately the inertial mass, total wave function, total energy
equal to the mass times c2, total momentum, kinetic energy and linear momentum
of the particle, and that the particle is a de Broglie wave, it obeys Newton’s laws
of motion, the de Broglie relations, the Schr¨odinger equation in small geometries,
Newton’s law of gravitation, and the Galileo-Lorentz-Einstein transformation at high
velocities. In this paper we give a self-contained illustration of the process by which
the electromagnetic component waves of such a particle in motion superpose into a
de Broglie (phase) wave.

A free massless vaculeon charge (q) endowed with a kinetic energy

now polarized under the charge’s own ﬁeld [2]. As a result the charge oscillates in
the vacuum, at a frequency Ωq; once in addition uni-directionally driven, it will also
be traveling at a velocity v here along X-axis in a one-dimensional box of length L,
ﬁrstly in +X-direction. Let axis X ′ be attached to the moving charge, X ′ = X

The above continues to indeed imply as L. de Broglie noted that a moving mass

clear-cut[2,2006b].

A tagged wave front of say ϕ†(X ′, T ) generated by the vaculeon charge, of v > 0,
to its right at location X ′ at time T , will after a round-trip of distance 2L in
time δT = 2L/c return from left, and propagate again to the right to X ′ at time
T ∗ = T + δT . Here it gains a total extra phase α′ = K2L + 2π due to 2L (with

The beat wave, of the wave variables Λd and Kd = 2π/Λd, transports with it the mass
of the particle at the velocity v, and in this context represents thereby a periodic
process of (the center of mass of) the particle, of a wavelength and wavevector equal
to Λd and Kd of the beat wave. Kd and v deﬁne for the particle dynamics an angular
frequency, Kdv = Ωd, as expressed by (8). Combining (10) and (4), and (8) and (3)
yield just the de Broglie relations:

Accordingly Kd, Λd, and Ωd represent the de Broglie wavevector, wavelength and
angular frequency. The beat wave
ψ of a phase velocity W resembles thereby the de
Broglie phase wave and it in the context of transporting the particle mass represents
e
the de Broglie wave of the particle.

Equation (13) showed the particle’s kinetic energy is transported at the angular
frequency 1
2 Ωd, half the value Ωd for transporting the particle mass, and is a source
motion eﬀect of order ( v
c )2. This is distinct from, actually exclusive of, the source
motion eﬀect, of order v, responsible for the earlier beat wave formation. We here
include the order ( v
c )2 eﬀect only simply as a multiplication factor to ψ, and thus have
~ΩdT which describes the particle’s kinetic energy transportation.

We have seen that the total wave superposed from the electromagnetic component
waves generated by a traveling oscillatory vaculeon charge, which together make up
our particle, has actually the requisite properties of a de Broglie wave. It exhibits

in spatial coordinate the periodicity of the de Broglie wave, by the wavelength Λd,

facilitated by a beat or de Broglie phase wave traveling at a phase velocity
with the beat in the total wave resulting naturally from the source-motion resultant
Doppler diﬀerentiation of the electromagnetic component waves. Λd conjoined with
the particle’s center-of-mass motion leads to a periodicity of the de Broglie particle
wave on time axis, the angular frequency Ωd. The Λd and Ωd obey the de Broglie
relations. The particle’s standing wave solutions in conﬁned space agree completely
with the Schr¨odinger solutions for an identical system.

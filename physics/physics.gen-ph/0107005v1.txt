spectrum to translate meters and seconds into radians and seconds. Based
on a unique geometric relationship, a new transformation of velocities and a
changed Lorentz transformation result. The physical angle of parallelism is
quantiﬁed. The way we measure distance and time is standardized, construct-
ing a theory of time and geometry to the universe.

1. INTRODUCTION

In Speculations in Science and T echnology 21, 213−225(1999), “Time, gravity
and the exterior angle of parallelism,” (available on-line from http://www.wkap.nl)
the author, Russell Clark Eskew, set out to standardize distance and time with
the electromagnetic spectrum [5, p. 220]. The number of seconds to a light year
illustrated how an inﬁnite number of seconds derive a mathematically convenient
scale for the physical angle of parallelism, 2 tan−1 e−a/s = 2 tan−1 e−1. In this
paper, we follow up by showing how the wavespeed of light, 299792458 meters per
second, with wavelengths in meters and radians per cycle, apply to a frequency f
in cycles per second to create a wavespeed in radians per second

where ψ = tan−1 sinh a [1, pp. 312–313] [5, p. 215], 0 < ψ < π
2 , a = ln f, and
s is the hyperbolic radius of curvature. The signiﬁcance of λ = tan ψ
2 , as Roger
Penrose points out [14, pp. 74–75], is that the stereographic projection of a line
drawn with an angle ψ
2 from the west pole of a sphere, P, and an angle ψ from the
origin, maps the point Q onto the plane x = 1 at tan ψ
2 . This preserves measuring
great circles and angles with a partial metric [2, pp. 92–95].

2. A UNIQUE GEOMETRIC RELATIONSHIP

The geometric relationship is unique in this scheme. With λ we know that the
hypotenuse line from the unit circle to the horizontal unit hyperbola, x2 − y2 = 1,
is

3. A NEW TRANSFORMATION OF VELOCITIES

This paper’s transformation of velocities is diﬀerent from that of Galileo Galilei

(1564–1642)

(3.1)

′

u = u

+ v.

The quantities are the “absolute velocity” u, i.e., a moving particle’s velocity with
respect to a ﬁxed reference frame, its “relative velocity” u′, i.e., the particle’s veloc-
ity with respect to a moving reference frame, and the “transport velocity” v, i.e.,
the velocity of the moving reference frame. Albert Einstein (1879–1955) believes
when u′ = c, c being the speed of light, that u = c rather than u = c + v [7, pp.
161, 173, 203–212] [10] [3]. The transformation of velocities of Einstein and H. A.
Lorentz (1853–1928) replaced (3.1) with

This paper’s transformation of velocities is diﬀerent from that of Einstein, too.

If the wavespeed in meters, c, is a constant, then dc = 0. But since the wavespeed
in radians, λ, is a variable, then we might have dλ 6= 0. This is why we hereby
replace c with λ, and v with λ2, which is also known as the accelerationframe of the
gravitational frame force Fframe = −mass × accelerationframe, in a rotating frame
of reference

4. CHANGING THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION

With the concept of proper time, a moving particle with instantaneous velocity
(i.e., “transport acceleration” of a moving reference frame) v(t) = λ2(t) relative
to some inertial system K (i.e., with “absolute acceleration” dλ/dψ with respect
to a ﬁxed reference frame) changes its position in a time interval dt by dx =
vdt = λ2dt. The space and time coordinates in K ′, (t′, z′, x′, y′) = (x
3) =
(ct′, z′, x′, y′), where the system is instantaneously at rest (i.e., with the parti-
cle’s “relative acceleration” dλ/da with respect to the moving reference frame),
are related to those in K, (t, z, x, y) = (x0, x1, x2, x3) = (ct, z, x, y), by the inverse

It is Einstein’s thought that c = 1 with the velocity v in tanh ξ = v

the wavespeed λ = f −1
t and frequency f = t+1
t−1 relate diﬀering wavespeeds
with a diﬀering number of seconds t. Rather than using the boost parameter ξ
in (4.3), the hyperbolic coordinates are equated with the circular coordinates by

The moving particle has advanced a distance vdt = λ2dt = dx

with twice the distance L of the hypotenuse, vs. twice the height D of the side of

The element of arc length ds of the particle’s path has ds2 = c2dt2 − |dx|2 when
dx1 = r sin ψds, dx2 = cos ψds, dx3 = sin ψds are “increments” of x1, x2, x3 having
the angle ψ. The direction of the path curve’s polar-equation-tangent determined
by the angle φ which this tangent makes with the radius r or by the angle ψ = θ + φ
which it makes with the x-axis thereby constructs dr = cos φds, rdϕ = sin φds, and
r sin ϕdθ [2, pp. 120–121]. A motionless particle has ds2 = dt2. The new distance
s is called proper time τ, and the Lorentz metric is dτ 2 = c2dt2 − r2 sin2 ϕdθ2 −
dr2 − r2dϕ2.

The square of the corresponding inﬁnitesimal invariant interval ds is

c = tanh a or where c is replaced by λ = tanh a

where β = v
In
the coordinate system K ′ where the system is instantaneously at rest, the space-
time increments are dt′ = dτ, dx′ = 0. Thus the invariant interval is ds = cdτ or
ds = λdτ . The increment of time dτ in the instantaneous rest frame of the system
is an invariant quantity that takes the form

2 and v by λ2.

ds2 = c2dt2 − |dx|2

radians, implying parallelism [11, pp. 414, 434] [5, p. 217] [2, p. 315]. The metric
is further deﬁned to involve the physical angle of parallelism, the main conclusion
of hyperbolic geometry [5, pp. 216–218] [13, p. 77] [12, p. 210]. In the case of
inﬁnite seconds, the physical angle of parallelism is 2 tan−1 e−1 = 0.705026844...
radians, in agreement with the physical evidence cited by Martin [11, p. 300] [5, p.
220]. The base a = ln f of such astronomical asymptotic triangles is an important
new kind of curve which is orthogonal to all parallels.

A second with meters is singular, while seconds with radians increase from one
to inﬁnity. You see an inﬁnite number of cycles apply to 1 second per radian,
a smaller 3 cycles apply to 2 seconds, 2 cycles apply to 3 seconds, and 1 cycle
applies to an inﬁnite number of seconds. Thus an astronomer might observe a star
to have a wavelength of 1.67 meters per cycle, with a frequency of e19 cycles per
second. Reading the equivalent radian values on the same row of the Table, he

STANDARDIZING DISTANCE AND TIME

could also know that there are 1.0 + (1.12 × 10−8) seconds per radian, a wavelength
of 5.60 × 10−9 radians per cycle, a wavespeed of λ = 1.0 − (1.12 × 10−8) radians per
second, absolute acceleration of 0.999999989, relative acceleration of 0.000000011,
and instantaneous velocity of 1.0 − (2.24 × 10−8) radians per second, and an angle
of parallelism of Π( a

2 − (1.50 × 10−7) radians per second [4].

s ) = π

The additional radian information constructs a theory of time and geometry to
the universe. All of the values are ﬁxed throughout the Table. The Equivalence
Principle is reﬁned with values of the variable λ based upon the speed of light, c
[14, pp. 22–25]. In this manner, the universe may be measured mathematically [6].

7. CONCLUSION

.

.

.

George Martin (1932– ) asks an interesting question [11, pp. 300–302],
“A meter was originally intended to be one ten-millionth of the dis-
tance from the earth’s equator to a pole measured along a merid-
ian.
[It] turns out to be mathematically convenient to pick
a [distance] scale such that Π(1) is 2 arctan e−1. In applying this
to the physical world, there is little diﬃculty in determining A, B,
C such that [angle] ABC has measure quite close to 2 arctan e−1.
However, how long is a segment of length 1? That is, how many
meters long is it? Since a meter has nothing to do with the axioms
of our geometry, the question is a valid one. Although it may be
really neat to have a geometry that provides for a standard angle
determining a standard length, all physical experiments indicate
that Π(x) could noticeably diﬀer from π
2 only for very large astro-
mical distances x. So a physical segment of length 1 would be very,
very long indeed.”

The answer is 299792458 meters long. Fewer meters apply to larger angles of
parallelism. Martin continues,

“The largest physical triangles that can be accurately measured
are astronomical. Let E stand for the Earth, S for the Sun, and
V for the brilliant blue star Vega. ∡SEV can be measured from
the Earth when ∡ESV is right. Using this measurement and the
2 - ∡SEV,
fact that [the defect of the triangle] SEV is less than π
one obtains [the defect of the triangle] SEV < 0.0000004. ”

In our Table, that agrees closely to a Short-wave radio (blue) angle of parallelism.
By comparison, one parsec is deﬁned as the distance of the Earth to the Sun (1
astronomical unit) that subtends an angle of 1 second of arc, equivalent to 206265
astronomical units. The comparable ES base of the asymptotic triangle is about
a = ln e19 = 19 radial units. With the angle of parallelism and electromagnetic
spectrum, meters and seconds can hereby be exchanged with radians and seconds.
We can geometrically measure the universe.

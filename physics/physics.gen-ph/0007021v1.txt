Abstract

The attempts to unify electromagnetism and gravitation have in-
cluded the formulations of Herman Weyl and the Kaluza Klein theory
with the ﬁfth dimension. More recently there have been fruitful at-
tempts in the domain of Quantum Superstrings and the author’s for-
mulation in terms of Quantum Mechanical Kerr-Newman Black Holes.
Though all these appear to be widely divergent approaches, they are
shown to have a uniﬁed underpinning in the context of quantized frac-
tal space time.

1 Introduction

The problem of the uniﬁcation of gravitation and electromagnetism has a long
and as yet unconcluded history. The very early attempt of Weyl did not ﬁnd
favour [1] as he had incorporated electromagnetism into the ﬁeld equation, as
it were from outside[2]. The ingenous suggestion of Kaluza that a ﬁfth, and
somehow suppressed, dimension be introduced [3, 1] also did not ﬁnd favour,

though the idea has resurfaced in the theory of Quantum Superstrings[4].
Another approach has been that of Quantum Mechanical Black Holes which
recovers the Kerr-Newman metric in the context of quantized fractal space
time (QFST)[5, 6, 7]. While there is formal resemblance to the Weyl for-
mulation on the one hand, there is an imaginary shift of coordinates, quite
meaningful in the above context, on the other. In the derivation of the Kerr
Newman metric too[8], there is a mysterious imaginary shift which however
is not explicable in classical theory. Finally both in Quantum Superstrings
and the (QFST) or quantized fractal space time picture, the underlying ge-
ometry is non-commutative [9, 10, 4].
So there are in these scenarios several at ﬁrst sight disparate and even inex-
plicable strands: the Kaluza-Klein curled up extra dimension, Weyl’s electro-
magnetism, Quantum Mechanical Black Holes, Quantum Superstrings, the
Kerr-Newman metric, non-commutative geometry.... We will now show that
infact all these characteristics have a uniﬁed underpinning in the context of
quantiﬁed fractal space time (QFST).

2 The Kaluza-Klein and Weyl Formulations

Our starting point is the fact that the fractal dimension of a Brownian quan-
tum path is 2, as pointed out by Abbott and Wise, Nottale and others[11, 12].
This was further analysed by the author and it was explained that this is
symptomatic of quantized fractal space time and it was shown that infact
the coordinate x becomes x + ıct[13], reminiscent of El Naschie’s complex
time[14] and the Hawking-Hartle static time[15]. The complex coordinates
or equivalently non-Hermitian position operators are symptomatic of the
unphysical zitterbewegung which is eliminated after an averaging over the
Compton scale. In this picture the ﬂuctuational creation of particles is taken
into account in a consistent cosmological scheme[16].
It is well known that the generalization of complex x coordinate to three
dimensions leads to quarternions[17], and the Pauli spin metrics.
We next come to a model of an electron as a Quantum Mechanical Black
Hole and widely discussed by the author (Cf. example[5, 6]). In this model
an electron is a spinning shell (reminiscent of Dirac’s model[18]) of radius
equalling the Compton wavelength, and equavalently a Kerr-Newman Black
Hole. Within this Compton scale Black Hole we encounter the unphysical

2

zitterbewegung region of complex (or non-Hermitian) coordinates already al-
luded to.
Infact electromagnetism was deduced[5, 6, 7] in two ways. The ﬁrst was by
considering an imaginary shift,

xµ → xµ + ıaµ, (aµ ∼ Compton scale)

in a Quantum Mechanical context. This lead to

ı¯h

∂
∂xµ → ı¯h

∂
∂xµ +

¯h
aµ

(1)

(2)

and the second term on the right side of (2) was shown to be the electromag-
netic vector potential Aµ,

Aµ = ¯h/aµ

(3)

The second was by taking into account the fact that at the Compton scale,
it is the so called negative energy two spinors χ of the Dirac bispinor that
dominate where,

χ → −χ

under reﬂections. This lead to the tensor density property,

∂
∂xµ to

∂
∂xµ − Γµν

ν

the second term on the right side of (4) being identiﬁed with Aµ,

Aµ = ¯hΓµν
ν

(4)

(5)

It was pointed out that (5) is formally and mathematically identical to Weyl’s
original formulation[1], except that here it arises due to the purely Quantum
Mechanical spinorial behaviour whereas Weyl had put it by hand.
Another early scheme for the uniﬁcation of gravitation and electromagnetism
as referred to earlier was that put forward by Kaluza and Klein[3] in which
an extra dimension was introduced and taken to be curled up. This idea has
resurfaced in recent years in String Theory.
We will ﬁrst show that the characterization of Aµ in (3) is identical to a
Kaluza Klein formulation. Then we will show that equations (4) and (5)
really denote the fact that the geometry around an electron is non-integrable.

3

Finally we will show that infact both (2) or (3) and (4) or (5) are the same
formulations.
We ﬁrst observe that the transformation (5) can be written as,

xı → xı + αı5x5

(6)

where αı5 in (6) will represent a small shift from the Minkowski metric gıj,
and ı, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, x5 being a ﬁfth coordinate introduced for purely math-
ematical conversion.
Owing to (6), we will have,

gıjdxıdxj → gıjdxıdxj + (gıjαj 5)dxıdx5

In Kaluza’s formulation,

Aµ ∝ gµ5

(7)

(8)

Comparison of (6) and (7) with (1) and (3) shows that indeed this is the
case. That is, the formulation given in (1) and (2) could be thought of as
introducing a ﬁfth curled up dimension, as in the Kaluza-Klein theory.
To see why the Quantum Mechanical formulation (4) and (5) corresponds to
Weyl’s theory, we start with the eﬀect of an inﬁnitesimal parallel displace-
ment of a vector [Bergmann].

δaσ = −Γσ

µνaµdxν

(9)

As is well known, (9) represents the extra eﬀect in displacements, due to the
curvature of space - in a ﬂat space, the right side would vanish. Considering
partial derivatives with respect to the µth coordinate, this would mean that,
due to (9)

∂aσ
∂xµ →

∂aσ
∂xµ − Γσ

µνaν

(10)

The second term on the right side of (10) can be written as:

−Γλ

µνgν

λaσ = −Γν

µνaσ

where we have utilized the property that in the above formulation (Cf.refs.[5,6,7]),

gµν = ηµν + hµν,

4

ηµν being the Minkowski metric and hµν a small correction whose square is
neglected.
That in, (10) becomes,

∂
∂xµ →

∂
∂xµ − Γν

µν

(11)

The relation (11) is the same as the relation (4).
We will next show the correspondence between (11) or (5) or (4) and (3) or
(2). To see this simply we note that the geodesic equation is,

˙uµ ≡

duµ
ds

= Γµ

νσuνuσ

(12)

We also use the fact that in the Quantum Mechanical Black Hole model
referred to, we have [5]

uµ = c

for µ = 1, 2 and3,

while,

So, from (12) we get,

| ˙uµ| = |uµ|

mc2
¯h

Γµ

νµ =

1
aν , |aν| =

¯h
mc

This establishes the required identity.

3 Quantized Fractal Space time and Quan-

tum Superstrings

It was shown[9] that the quantized fractal space time referred to really leads
to a non-commutative geometry, not surprisingly:

[x, y] = 0(l2), [x, px] = ı¯h[1 + l2], [t, E] = ı¯h[1 + τ 2], · · ·

(13)

It was shown earlier[9] that these relations directly lead to the Dirac equation:
Quantized fractal space time or the above relation (13) are the underpinning
for Quantum Mechanical spin or the Quantum Mechanical Black Hole, that
is ultimately equations like (2) or (3) and (4) or (5).

5

It is also true that both the Kaluza Klein formulation and the non commu-
tative geometry (13) hold in the theory of Quantum Superstrings.
Infact we get from here a clue to the mysterious six extra curled up dimen-
sions of Quantum Superstring Theory. For this we observe that (13) gives
an additional contribution to the Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle and we
can easily deduce

∆p ˙∆x ∼ ¯hl2

Remembering that at this Compton scale

It follows that

∆p ∼ mc

∆x ∼ l3

(14)

as l ∼ 10−11cms for the electron we recover from (14) the Planck Scale, as
well as a rationale for the peculiar fact that the Planck Scale is the cube of
the electron Compton scale.
More importantly, what (14) shows is, that at this level, the single dimension
along the x axis shows up as being three dimensional. That is there are two
extra dimensions, in the unphysical region below the Compton scale. As this
is true for the y and z coordinates also, there are a total of six curled up or
unphysical or inaccessible dimensions in the context of the preceding section.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

If we start with equations (1) to (3) which were related to QFST (Quan-
tized Fractal space time) and the non-commutative relation (13) we obtain
a uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and gravitation. On the other hand if we
consider the spinorial behaviour of the Dirac wave function, we get (4) or (5).
The former has been seen to be the same as the Kaluza formulation while the
latter is formally similar to the Weyl formulation - but in this case (5) is not
put in by hand. Rather it is a Quantum Mechanical consequence. We have
thus shown that these two approaches are the same. The extra dimensions
are thus seen to be conﬁned to the unphysical Compton scale - classically
speaking they are curled up or inaccessible.
In a sense this is not surprising. The bridge between the two approaches was

6

the Kerr-Newman metric which uses, though without a clear physical mean-
ing in classical theory, the transformation (1). The reason why an imaginary
shift is associated with spin is to be found in the Quantum Mechanical zit-
terbewegung and the consequent QFST.
Wheeler remarked [19], ”the most evident shortcoming of the geometrody-
namic model as it stands is this, that it fails to supply any completely natural
place for spin 1/2 in general and for the neutrino, in particular”, while ”it
is impossible to accept any description of elementary particles that does not
have a place for spin half.” Infact the bridge between the two is the transfor-
mation (1). It introduces spin half into general relativity and curvature to
the electron theory, via the equation (5) or (10).
In this context it is interesting to note that El Naschie has given the fractal
formulation of gravitation[20].
Thus apparently disparate concepts like the Kaluza Klein and Weyl formu-
lations, Quantum Mechanical Black Holes, quantized fractal space time and
QSS are seen to have a harmonius overlap, in the context of QFST with its
roots in the ﬂuctuational creation of particles[21].

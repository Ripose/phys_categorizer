Abstract

We consider the Ricatti equation in the context of population dy-
namics,quantum scattering and a more general context.We examine
some exactly solvable cases of real life interest.

1 Introduction

The Riccati Equation [1, 2, 3]

y′ = p(t) + q(t)y + r(t)y2

appears in several branches of applicable mathematics, for example popu-
lation dynamics and mathematical physics, as in quantum scattering.It is
known that it exhibits chaotic behavior [4].It is also well known that, it
reduces to a second order linear diﬀerential equation by the substitution,
y = u′
u ,
when we get,

u′′ + g(t)u′ + f (t)u = 0

(1) and (2) have been studied in detail for a long time[5, 6, 7].
It may be mentioned that if two solutions of the Riccati equation are equal at
a point, then they coincide.The reason lies in the continuity of the logarithmic
derivative u′
u given in the substitution that lead from (1) to (2).

We will now consider exact solutions of the Riccati equation in two diﬀerent
contexts,from the ﬁeld of population dynamics and the ﬁeld of quantum
scattering.

2 Some exact solutions

2.1 A Problem In Population Dynamics

We now examine coupled Riccati type equations of relevance to a population
model.

Gause’s Model

Consider two-species populations occurring together,and assume that the
growth of each is inhibited by members ,both of its own and of the other
species.Denoting the number of individuals in species 1 as N1 and species 2
as N2,we have the Gause’s competition equations:[8]

where r1,r2,a1,a2 are deﬁned below. Thus we are assuming that the per capita
growth of each population at an instant is a linear function of the sizes of
the two competing populations at that instant.Each population would grow
logistically if it were alone with logistic parameters r1 and a1 for species 1
and r2 and a2 for species 2 .
In general the simultaneous diﬀerential equations cannot be explicitly solved.We
now consider a particular set of circumstances in which they can be solved.Thus
for (3) and (4) we specialize to, with a more convenient notation ,

2.2 Problems from Scattering Theory

By reversing the method used above ,the quantum mechanical radial Schr¨odinger
equation

u′′

−

H(r)u = 0

can be reduced to a Riccati equation

v′

+ v2 = H(r)
by the substitution v = u′
u . The form (10)or (11) is used in phase shift analy-
sis for example in Calogero’s variable phase approach [9].It is also possible to

use the form (11) for building up an iterative procedure[10] .We would now
like to point out that (11) can be used in a diﬀerent context for providing
exact solutions for speciﬁed classes of the potential function f(r). Let us write
in (11)

This is a shifted inverse square potential and the solution u is given by

3 Other Exact and Asymptotic Solutions

We now consider some asymptotic solutions of (11),which we write as,

f and g being bounded functions. So (13) can be written as ,

z′

= (z + g)2 > 0, z = u

g,

which shows that z is an increasing function of r.Suppose z is unbounded.So
for large r,we should have from (14)

This is a contradiction. Therefore z is bounded and so also u ,that is u

Therefore for large r,(13) becomes

By way of veriﬁcation of (15),let us consider (13) with,

(everywhere, and so also for large r). Using this example,with transfor-
mations of the independent variable,we can generate similar solutions. For
example, if we substitute for r, t = t(r), (13) becomes

where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to t.The choice t′ = f (r),
leads to a similar equation, and one can verify that for

f (r) =

r−2/3

u = ar1/3

is a solution.More generally as can be easily veriﬁed arn is a solution for
f (r) = narn−1
a2r2n and so on.However in these examples, neither u nor
−
u’ are asymptotically bounded.
Finally it maybe observed that if one solution of the Riccati equation (13) is
known,then others could be derived therefrom[3].

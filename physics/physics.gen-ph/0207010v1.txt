Abstract

A new information-theoretic modelling of reality has given rise to a quantum-foam de-
scription of space, relative to which absolute motion is meaningful.
In a previous paper
(Cahill and Kitto) it was shown that in this new physics Michelson interferometers show
absolute motion eﬀects when operated in dielectric mode, as indeed all such experiments
had indicated, and re-analysis of the experimental data showed that the measured speeds
were all in agreement with the COBE CBR dipole-ﬁt speed of 365
18km/s. Here the new
physics is applied, using a diﬀerent type of analysis, to the extensive data from dielectric-
mode interferometer observations by Miller (1933). Here the speed of in-ﬂow of the quantum
foam towards the Sun is determined from Miller’s data to be 47
6km/s, compared to the
theoretical value of 42km/s. This observed in-ﬂow is a signature of a quantum gravity eﬀect
in the new physics.

A new information-theoretic modelling of reality [1, 2] has given rise to a quantum-foam
description of space, relative to which absolute motion is meaningful. In Ref.[3] it was shown that
in this new physics Michelson interferometers [4] show absolute motion eﬀects when operated
in dielectric mode, as indeed all such experiments had in fact indicated, and re-analysis of the
experimental data showed that the measured speeds were all in agreement with each other and
together in agreement with the COBE CBR dipole-ﬁt speed of 365
18km/s [5] using the M´unera
[6] re-analysis of interferometer data. The new physics is here further tested against experiment
by re-analysing the extensive dielectric-mode interferometer data of Miller [7] and extracting
a quantum-gravity eﬀect. These results amount to a dramatic development in fundamental
physics.

Although the theory and experiment together indicate that absolute motion is an aspect
of reality one must hasten to note that this theory also implies that the Einstein Special and
General Theory of Relativity formalism remains essentially intact. In [1] it was shown that this
formalism arises from the quantum-foam physics, but that the quantum-foam system amounts
to a physically real foliation of the spacetime construct. Despite this there are some phenomena
which are outside the Einstein formalism, namely the detection of absolute motion. We see here
the emergence of a new theoretical system which subsumes the older theory and covers new
phenomena, in particular it uniﬁes gravity and the quantum phenomena.

As shown in [3] and reviewed here the new physics provides a diﬀerent account of the Michel-
son interferometers. The main outcome is that the time diﬀerence for light travelling via the
orthogonal arms, when one arm is parallel to the direction of motion, is now given by

∆t = k2 Lv2
c3 .

Here v is the magnitude of the absolute velocity v of the interferometer through the quantum-
1) where n is the
foam, projected onto the plane of the interferometer. And k =
refractive index of the medium through which the light in the interferometer passes, L is the
length of each arm and c is the speed of light relative to the quantum foam. This expression
follows from both the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction eﬀect and that the speed of light through
the dielectric is V = c/n, ignoring any Fresnel dragging eﬀects. This is one of the aspects of
the quantum foam physics that distinguishes it from the Einstein formalism and is discussed in
[3]. The time diﬀerence ∆t is revealed by the fringe shifts on rotating the interferometer. In
Newtonian physics k = √n3 [3, 4], while in Einsteinian physics k = 0 expressing the funda-
mental assumption that absolute motion is not measurable and indeed has no meaning. So the
experimentally determined value of k is a key test of fundamental physics.

on clocks and rods. In this physics the speed of light is only c relative to the quantum-foam,
but to observers moving with respect to this quantum-foam the speed appears to be still c,
but only because their clocks and rods are aﬀected by the quantum-foam. As shown in [1] such
observers will ﬁnd that observations of distant events will be described by the Einstein spacetime
formalism, but only if they restrict measurements to those achieved by using clocks, rods and
light pulses. It is simplest in the new physics to work in the quantum-foam frame of reference. If
there is a dielectric present at rest in this frame, such as air, then the speed of light in this frame
is V = c/n. If the dielectric is moving with respect to the quantum foam, as in an interferometer
attached to the Earth, then the speed of light relative to the quantum-foam is still V = c/n up
to corrections due to Fresnel drag. But this dragging is a very small eﬀect and is not required

in the present analysis. Hence this new physics requires a diﬀerent method of analysis from
that of the Einstein physics. With these cautions we now describe the operation of a Michelson
interferometer in this new physics, and show that it makes predictions diﬀerent to that of the
Einstein physics. Of course experimental evidence is the ﬁnal arbiter in this conﬂict of theories.

Figure 1: Schematic diagrams of the Michelson Interferometer, with beamsplitter/mirror at A and
mirrors at B and C, on equal length arms when parallel, from A. D is a quantum detector (not drawn in
(b)) that causes localisation of the photon state by a collapse process. In (a) the interferometer is at rest
in space. In (b) the interferometer is moving with speed v relative to space in the direction indicated.
Interference fringes are observed at the quantum detector D. If the interferometer is rotated in the plane
through 90o, the roles of arms AC and AB are interchanged, and during the rotation shifts of the fringes
are seen in the case of absolute motion, but only if the apparatus operates in a dielectric. By counting
fringe changes the speed v may be determined.

As shown in Fig.1 the beamsplitter/mirror A sends a photon ψ(t) into a superposition
ψ(t) = ψ1(t) + ψ2(t), with each component travelling in diﬀerent arms of the interferometer,
until they are recombined in the quantum detector (D) which results in a localisation process, and
one spot in the detector is produced. Repeating with many photons reveals that the interference
between ψ1 and ψ2 at the detector results in fringes. To simplify the analysis here assume that
the two arms are constructed to have the same lengths when they are physically parallel to
each other. The Fitzgerald-Lorentz eﬀect in the new physics is that the arm AB parallel to the
direction of motion is shortened to

by motion through space at speed v. Following Fig.(1) we consider the case when the apparatus
is moving at speed v through space, and that the photon states travel at speed V = c/n relative
to the quantum-foam which is space, where n is the refractive index of the gas and c is the speed
of light, in vacuum, relative to the space. Let the time taken for ψ1 to travel from A
B be
A be tBA. In moving from the beamsplitter at A to B, the photon state

Similarly on returning from B to A the photon state ψ1 must travel the distance

Now trivially ∆t = 0 if v = 0, but also ∆t = 0 when v
= 0 but only if V = c. This then would
result in a null result on rotating the apparatus. Hence the null result of the Michelson-Morley
apparatus in the new physics is only for the special case of photons travelling in vacuum for
which V = c. However if the Michelson-Morley apparatus is immersed, for example, in a gas
then V < c and a non-null eﬀect is expected on rotating the apparatus, since now ∆t
= 0. It is
essential then in analysing data to correct for this refractive index eﬀect. Putting V = c/n in

air = 0.00058 (i.e. kair = 0.0241) and for Helium k2

Of the early interferometer experiments Michelson and Morley [8] and Miller [7] operated in
air (n = 1.00029), while that of Illingworth [9] used Helium (n = 1.000035). We expect then
that for air interferometers k2
He = 0.00007,
which explains why these experiments reported very small but nevertheless non-null and so
signiﬁcant eﬀects. All non-vacuum experiments gave k > 0, that is, a non-null eﬀect. All
vacuum (n = 1) interferometer experiments, having k = 0, give null eﬀects as expected, but
such experiments cannot distinguish between the new physics and the Einstein physics, only
dielectric-mode interferometers can do that. The notion that the Michelson-Morley experiment
gave a null eﬀect is a common misunderstanding that has dominated physics for more than a
century. By “null eﬀect” they meant that the eﬀect was much smaller than expected, and the
cause for this is only now apparent from the above. When the air and Helium interferometer
data were re-analysed using the appropriate k values in [3] they gave consistent values which
were also in agreement with the CBR speed. So these early interferometer experiments did
indeed reveal absolute motion, and demonstrated that k

= 0 in these experiments.

Here the data from the exquisite and extensive air-interferometer experiments with L = 64m
(obtained by multiple reﬂections along the arms) by Miller at Mt.Wilson (Latitude +34013′)
beginning in 1921 [7] are re-analysed using not only the quantum-foam eﬀect in (1), but also a
quantum-gravity eﬀect predicted by the new physics. It turns out that Miller actually performed
the ﬁrst quantum gravity experiment. Miller reported in [7] particular observations over four
days in 1925/26 recording the time variation of the projection of the velocity v onto the inter-
ferometer throughout each of these days. His data is shown in Fig.2 for the azimuths and vM
speeds obtained from fringe shifts. The azimuth is the angle measured from the local meridian
indicating the direction of the projected velocity v, and the vM speed is deﬁned as that from
(1) with k = 1 using the measured ∆t, so that v = vM /k.

Miller’s idea was that v should have two components: (i) a cosmic velocity of the solar
system through space, and (ii) the orbital velocity of the Earth about the Sun through space.
Over a year this vector sum would result in a changing v, as was in fact observed, and is obvious
in Fig.2. Further, since the orbital speed was known, Miller was able to extract from the data
the magnitude and direction of v as the orbital speed oﬀered an absolute scale. We shall use
k as the k value obtained by this approach. Miller was led to the conclusion that for reasons
unknown the interferometer did not indicate true values of v, and for this reason he introduced
the parameter k. Miller noted, in fact, that k
<< 1. Fitting the data using vtangent = 30km/s
we obtain k = 0.044
0.005 (Miller found k = 0.046) and v = 210km/s and a direction (see
later). However that k > kair tells us that another velocity component has been overlooked.
Miller only knew of the tangential or orbital speed of the Earth, whereas the new physics predicts
that as-well there is a quantum-gravity radial in-ﬂow vin of the quantum foam, so

for case of CBR cosmic speed of 365km/s, orbital velocity of 30km/s, quantum gravity in-ﬂow of 42km/s,

We can combine the dielectric eﬀect and the Earth-velocity eﬀect to extract from Miller’s
data the speed of this in-ﬂow component. For circular orbits the in-ﬂow and tangential speeds
are orthogonal, so the actual velocity of the Earth through the quantum foam is given by (16)
vin component. From this we easily ﬁnd that

Using the above k value and the value of kair we obtain vin = 47

which uniﬁes gravity and the quantum predicts the in-ﬂow speed to be, at distance R from the

where M is the mass of the Sun, R is the distance of the Earth from the Sun, and G is New-
ton’s gravitational constant. G is essentially a measure of the rate at which matter eﬀecctively

giving vtangent = 30km/s, and so vin = √2vtangent = 42km/s. Hence the value for vin from the
Miller data is consistent with the theoretical value. Since it is vR = √3vtangent and not vtangent
that sets the scale we must re-scale Miller’s value for v to be √3
210 = 364km/s, which now
compares favourably with the COBE CBR speed.

The gravitational acceleration arises from inhomogeneities in the ﬂow and is given by

∇

g = (vin.
)vin in this quantum-foam ﬂow physics [1]. So the Miller experiment actually
amounted to the ﬁrst quantum gravity experiment, and the ability of dielectric-mode inter-
ferometers to measure absolute motion made this possible. New dielectric-mode interferometers
are being used at Flinders University to measure the quantum-foam radial in-ﬂow speed asso-
ciated with the Earth’s gravity. This component did not contribute to Miller’s data as it is
perpendicular to the plane of the interferometer.

Miller was also able to extract the direction of vcosmic from analysis of his observational
data using the daily and seasonal time-dependencies apparent in Fig.2 and obtained a right
ascension and declination of (α, δ) = (17h, +700). In Fig.2 are shown the quantum-foam physics
‘predictions’ for the vM speeds and azimuths using the projection of v in (16) onto the plane
of the Miller interferometer at Mt.Wilson, using vcosmic = vCBR is 365km/s, the orbital speed
is 30km/s and the in-ﬂow speed is 42km/s, the kair value, and the Miller direction for vcosmic.
This illustrates that the new physics agrees with Miller’s 1925/1926 observational data, both for
absolute values and for time variation over each day and seasonally. The Miller data used here
was obtained by inspection of hand-drawn ﬁgures published in [7] and are not very accurate,
and so a complete re-analysis of the data is not possible. The error bars are only indicative and
should not be taken as Miller’s values.

0.2h,

While the extracted cosmic speed from Miller’s data here, and from the Michelson-Morley
and Illingworth data in [3], are in excellent agreement with the CBR speed the direction found
above is in complete disagreement with the COBE determined direction [5] which is (α, δ) =
20). This COBE direction gives azimuth and vM speed interferometer
(11.2h
predictions that are totally inconsistent with the Miller data in Fig.2. However the two directions
are at 900 to each other. This suggests that this disagreement might be caused by a deﬁnitional
problem with the right ascension and declination in the COBE satellite mission. At least this is
a prediction of the present work.

It is interesting to return to the Michelson-Morley experimental data of 1887 which since
then, with rare exceptions, has been claimed to have given a null result, and so supporting the
Einstein assumption that absolute motion has no meaning. In fact Michelson-Morley reported
non-null eﬀects, but much smaller than they expected. They made observations of thirty-six
complete turns using a L = 1.1 meter length air-interferometer in Cleveland, Latitude 41030′N,
with six turns at 12 : 00 hrs (7:00 hrs ST) on each day of July 8, 9 and 11, 1887 and similarly at
18 : 00 hrs (13:00 hrs ST) on July 8, 9 and 12, 1887. Their results after averaging over the noon
sessions, and also averaging the evening sessions, and also averaging the ﬁrst half-turn and the
last half-turn data, are shown in Fig.3 (the data is available from [7]).

The fringe shifts were extremely small but within their observational capabilities. The fringe
shifts actually correspond to a maximum vM speed of some 8.3km/s, being slighlty lower than
Miller’s speeds in Fig.2 due to the higher latitude of Cleveland compared to Mt.Wilson. Also
plotted in Fig.3 are the quantum-foam physics predictions using in (16) the CBR speed of
365km/s, the orbital speed of 30km/s, the quantum gravity in-ﬂow of 42km/s, the Miller direc-
tion and the value of kair, for the time, date and location of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
The dependence on rotation angle θ in Fig.3 is sin(2θ). We see that they observed essentially
what the new physics predicts.

CBR cosmic speed 365km/s, orbit speed of 30km/s, quantum gravity in-ﬂow of 42km/s, the kair value
and Miller’s direction for vcosmic.

So their results were never null, and can now be fully comprehended. They in-fact performed
the ﬁrst quantum-foam experiment, as revealed by the dielectric eﬀect. Their expected fringe
shifts were based on using the Newtonian value of k = 1 and on v being atleast 30km/s, due
to the Earth’s orbital motion, and so predicting fringe shifts 10 times larger than actually seen
(the true value for v2 in (1) is some 102 larger but the dielectric eﬀect gives a reduction of
approximately 1/1000). Of course that Michelson and Morley saw any eﬀect is solely due to
the presence of the air in their interferometer, an eﬀect that neither they nor later generations
of physicists ever noticed. Vacuum interferometer experiments of the same era by Joos [10]
gave vM < 1km/s, and are consistent with a null eﬀect, as also predicted by the quantum-foam
physics. Of course if Michelson and Morley had used glass rods in their interferometer they
would have seen eﬀects more than 1000 times larger, and the history of physics over the last 100
years would have been totally diﬀerent.

The experimental results analysed herein and in [3] show that absolute motion is detectable.
This is motion with respect to a quantum-foam system that is space. As well quantum matter

eﬀectively acts as a sink for the quantum-foam, and the ﬂow of that quantum-foam towards
the Sun has been conﬁrmed in Miller’s data. So that experiment was the ﬁrst quantum gravity
experiment. These results are in conﬂict with the fundamental assumption by Einstein that ab-
solute motion has no meaning and so cannot be measured. Vacuum interferometer experiments
do give null results, for example see [10, 11, 12, 13], but they only check the Lorentz contraction
eﬀect, and this is common to both theories. So they are unable to distinguish the new physics
from the Einstein physics. As well that the interferometer experiments and their results fall
into two classes, namely vacuum and dielectric has gone unnoticed. The non-null results from
dielectric-mode interferometers have always been rejected on the grounds that they would be in
conﬂict with the many successes of the Special and General Theory of Relativity. However this
is not strictly so, and it turns out that these successes survive in the new physics, which actually
subsumes the Einstein formalism, even though the absolute motion eﬀect is not in the Einstein
physics. Einstein essentially arrived at a valid formalism from a wrong assumption. The new
more encompassing physics allows the determination of a physically real foliation of the space-
time construct (the Panlev´e-Gullstrand foliation) and so it actually breaks the diﬀeomorphism
symmetry of General Relativity. The results here and in [3] demonstrate that the new physics
is an experimentally tested uniﬁcation of gravity and the quantum.

This paper is dedicated to the memory of Dayton C. Miller of the Case School of Applied
Science, Cleveland, Ohio. The author thanks Warren Lawrance for on-going discussions of
new-generation dielectric-mode interferometer experiments.

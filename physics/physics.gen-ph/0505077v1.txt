Abstract

The n-point amplitudes of gauge and gravity theory are given as a series in
the coupling. The recursive derivative expansion is used to ﬁnd all of the coupling
coeﬃcients. Initial conditions to any bare Lagrangian, or of an improved action, are
used to compute quantum amplitudes.

Introduction

Gauge theory amplitudes and correlators have been well studied for many years.
Many techniques have been developed so as to compute tree and one-loop amplitudes,
and holographic duals to supersymmetric gauge theories also gave computational
tools. The amplitude and correlator calculations in these theories, either in weak
coupling or strong coupling, are typically given to low orders.

There are a variety of methods to extend the scope of these calculations, and to
ﬁnd complete expressions for amplitudes and correlators. This is a means in quantum
ﬁeld theory to ﬁnd order unity, or large coupling results.

The amplitudes of pure gauge theories are given here as a series in the coupling,
g or GN . The derivative expansion has been formulated and applied to many theories
[1]-[10]. The solution to this iteration is presented for gauge theory models; the scalar
ﬁeld theory coupling expansion is given in [11]. There is a further mathematical
simpliﬁcation possible within the tensor formulation in the contributions.

The Lagrangians considered are,

with a possibly inﬁnite tower of higher dimension operators. The classical scattering
of the F 2 and R actions are given in [12] (those in scalar theory in [13]; the number
basis representation is very useful for labeling all of the contributions, including tree
graphs containing ghosts. These tree graphs and the numbers parameterizing them
enter into the quantum solution through the initial conditions.

The derivative expansion is used to ﬁnd the perturbative quantum amplitudes.
Instantons are not included; their momentum structure is expected to have a number
basis as do the classical scattering.

Amplitudes

The coupling expansions of scalar ﬁeld theory amplitudes have appeared in [12]
and contain the required integral and tensor calculations. The primary complications
in the gauge theory calculation is due to the masslessness and tensor algebra.

The recursive approach to the amplitude calculations has a solution presented
in [11]. The latter is represented in Figure 1 with the rainbow graphs; a sum of
these graphs with any number of nodes is neccesary, and with internal ghost lines
bnodes
in covariant gauges, subject to the coupling addition that q =
b=1 qb (qb is the
coupling power of classical scattering at node b which is n
2 for Yang-Mills theory).

The classical scattering is required to specify the tensors at the nodes. The TrF 2
Yang-Mills scattering can be obtained in a well ordered manner with the use of string
theory.

The recursive solution to the coupling coeﬃcients are calculated in this section.
The solution to the recursive formulae is represented in Figure 1, and the graphs do
not show the permutations on the external lines. These diagrams were evaluated in
scalar theory in [11].

The tensor is to be contracted with the function in (33) from the propagator products
and with vertex tensors in (21) at nodes 1 and 2. The propagators are ηµν/p2. The
vertex tensors are discussed in the prior section and in [11]. The tensor at node 2
used in the calculation contains the propagator expansions as at node 1, and the ε’s
stripped and contracted with those at node 1. The remaining momenta, in (21), if
they are internal are integrated over.

The loop integrations follow the form as illustrated in Figure 1. At each node
the momenta kσ, from σb(mi) to σb(mf ), ﬂow into the loop; these momenta deﬁne
the nodal momentum Pb. These tensors with the integral between the ﬁrst two nodes

The basis could be rewritten in terms of the propagator momentum qj, but the tree
amplitude forms and their divergences suggest to keep the same basis. Due to the
number of polarizations, 2c2 + c3 is equal to the number of external lines left of node
1; the number c1 can be arbitrarily high due to the series in (39).

The correlated sets κi, βi

˜βi (of dimension c1, c2, and c3) are determined from:
1) the n-point scattering φn set of numbers, 2) expansion of the propagators that
contain internal loop momentum, and 3) the inner product of the momenta and εj
with the integrated tensors (36) including external momenta and metrics. These sets

10

are derived from numbers parameterizing the the classical tensors as in (4); these
can be imported from the numbers labeling the propagators on the aﬃliated scalar
diagram.

These tensors of dimension ci in principle are determined from the well deﬁned
set of numbers such as the φn are, which label the φ3 diagrams, and from the node
ki together with the polarization numbers entering into the two
momenta Pa =
nodes.

P

In a given diagram, illustrated in Figure 1, there are potentially external lines
at all of the nodes bnodes. The node numbers bnodes range from 2 to a maximum set
by the coupling order; n-point tree amplitudes are of gn−2 coupling order (without
possible higher dimension terms in the classical action). These couplings constrain
the number of internal lines within the integrals and the nodes;
2) is a
ﬁxed order, n
2+2L for an L loop n-point. The tree amplitudes with ghost lines also
have to be included, in the covariant gauge with covariant ε’s (there are light-cone
ε’s but the tree amplitudes are diﬀerent).

P

The quantum numbers that specify the diagram in Figure 1 are the propagator
labels σ(i, p), or the equivalent φn numbers. The node momentum indices σb(mi) to
σb(mf ) labels the external lines at each vertex. The ordering of the lines is required
also in the σ.

2, 2

The integration from nodes 1

3, etc..., at a ﬁxed order in their couplings,
can be performed with a systematic implementation of the previous quantum numbers
and node momentum. The integration along the chain of vertices is inﬂuenced in a
sequential manner because the tensor is altered sequentially. The integration removes
the propagators containing components of the node’s momenta in the j + 1 side of
j + 1, and the tensor (analagous to (4)) then contains inner products which are
j
non-tree like. However, the individual tensors in (4) do factor into the left node
and right node with the use of metrics. This property makes all of the integrals
independent, at the computational cost of specifying the metrics.

and the sums in κ, (β, ˜β), (β′, ˜β′) are altered. The sums have a diﬀerent dependence
on aj and dj.

In the derivation, the permutations on the external lines are completely sym-
metrized in the kinematics as there are no color quantum attached to the gravitons.
Also, mixed particle type scattering can be obtained, between gauge and gravity
modes, and in general including varying spin types if the classical scattering is known.

Concluding remarks

The derivative expansion and its recursion is solved for both gauge and gravity
theories. Expressions for the amplitudes are obtained, and a closed form for them
is given. At any given order in derivatives, the operator’s prefactor f (λ) can be
determined. All the perturbative integrals are computed.

Three sets of similar tensor indices are required to make the expressions explicit,
apart from a recursive integral. Six sets are required for gravity. The sets of indices
are dependent on a number of parameters, and can be solved for recursively. However,
it is very suggestive that there is a group theory or topological determination in their
determination, which is applicable to mixed particle scattering.

There is a power series in the momenta of the external lines. The power series
and its summation are likely to be relevant in certain kinematical regimes. The tensor
indices, and their possible topological determination, are relevant in this calculation.

The amplitudes are written in terms of the polarizations, and thus they are not in
a spinor helicity format. There are further simpliﬁcations with the former. Covariant
tree amplitudes in the gauge and gravity theories are found in [12],[13].

Knowledge of the coeﬃcients in the perturbative sector can be used to ﬁnd non-
perturbative formalisms, i.e. strong coupling. The global tensor determination, and
its symmetry, is necessary for this.

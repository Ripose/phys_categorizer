Abstract
An interdisciplinary physical theory of emergent consciousness has previously
been proposed, stemming from quantum computation-like behavior between
109 or more entangled molecular qubit states (microtubulin). This model
relies on the Penrose-Di´osi gravity-driven wavefunction collapse framework,
and thus is subject to any secondary classical and quantum gravity eﬀects.
Speciﬁcally, if large extra spatial dimensions exist in the Universe, then the
resulting corrections to Newtonian gravity cause this model to suﬀer serious
diﬃculties. It is shown that if the extra dimensions are larger than 100 fm in
size, then this model of consciousness is unphysical. If the dimensions are on
the order of 10 fm in size, then a signiﬁcantly smaller number of microtubu-
lin than originally predicted are required to satisfy experimental constraints.
Some speculation on evolution of consciousness is also oﬀered, based on the
possibility that the size of these extra dimensions may have been changing
over the history of the Universe.

1 Introduction

Consciousness as an emergent phenomenon of physical and/or biological sys-
tems is a growing ﬁeld of interdisciplinary interest. Traditionally, biophysi-
cal and neuroscientiﬁc descriptions of brain processes have been restricted to
classical neural network designs (see e.g. [1] and references therein). How-
ever, there is increasing evidence to suggest that many biological processes
rely on quantum mechanical behavior, including protein folding [2], single-
photon activation of the rhodopsin cis-trans isomers in visual pre-perception
[3], and neuron impulse transmission across the synaptic gap [4].

The quantum computing revolution [5] has spawned a new frame of ref-
erence from which to view the problem of consciousness. To reconcile the
aforementioned “bio-quantum mechanical” phenomena with the common in-
terpretation of the brain as a computational device, recent proposals have
sought to describe higher cognitive functions as quantum processes. Compre-
hensive summaries of this burgeoning ﬁeld can be found in Reference [6], but
speciﬁc important contributions to the ﬁeld include [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. From
a slightly diﬀerent perspective, Davies [13] has proposed a link between bio-
logical complexity and holographic theories of cosmological entropy bounds.
Classical computation is based on a binary system of bits which must
either be in one state (1) or the other (0). Memory storage and computation
proceed by assigning values to a string of bits and performing logical opera-
tions in series. Such a “linear” processing system ultimately limits the speed
with which calculations can be performed. Quantum computers export the
superposition principle of states, replacing the classical bit with a two-state
quantum bit (qubit) |ψi, which can assume both values (0 and 1) simultane-
ously. Quantum logic operations are performed on the combination of qubits
in the product state |ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i ⊗ |ψ3i ⊗ · · ·, which force evolution to an
entangled superposition of states. Since this enables the quantum computer
to evaluate multiple and simultaneous “solutions” to the logical operations,
massively-parallel computations can be eﬀected.

Among the many immediate beneﬁts of quantum computing is the de-
creased computation time required for classically-diﬃcult problems. This
includes prime number factorization algorithms that execute in polynomial
time as opposed to exponential time [14] (as a function of the size of the
number), as well as fast database search algorithms [15]. Both of these are
particularly attractive features to cognitive scientists, since the classical com-
putational time required to perform equivalent tasks is astronomical.

2

The primary obstacle to a realization of quantum computation is pre-
venting the qubit entanglement from decohering via interactions with the
surrounding environment. This is generally done by isolating the system from
the environment, and reducing the temperature to exceedingly low values,
making the notion of room-temperature (and desktop) quantum computers
a distant reality.

Such rapid decoherence is arguably the death-knell for most quantum
theories of cognition. The academic community is split on whether or not
this is an obstacle that Nature has managed to overcome in designing a bi-
ological quantum computer (see the discussion in [16]). The most developed
theory of cognitive quantum computation – dubbed the “Orchestrated Ob-
jective Reduction” (Orch-OR) mechanism – has been proposed by Penrose
and Hameroﬀ [12], who argue that environmentally-isolated quantum entan-
glement states are kept coherent long enough to perform conscious processes.
However, the Orch-OR mechanism relies on classical Newtonian gravity
to address a largely quantum mechanical issue. If a theory wishes to combine
gravitation with quantum eﬀects, then all aspects of quantum gravity should
be addressed. In particular, the accuracy of Newtonian gravity at small (sub-
micron) scales has recently come under scrutiny, thanks to string-inspired
theories which propose the existence of large extra spatial dimensions [17, 18].
This paper will thus re-examine the feasibility of the Orch-OR in light of
the possible existence of large extra spatial dimensions (in the Arkani-Hamed,
Dvali, Dimopoulos model). First, a more detailed synopsis of the debate sur-
rounding the Orch-OR model are discussed in Section 2. The physical basis
for the gravity-driven collapse mechanism is reviewed in Section 3, and a
brief introduction to large extra dimensions follows in Section 5. Associated
modiﬁcations to the gravity-collapse model are discussed in Section 6, includ-
ing the potential impact on “traditional” quantum mechanical phenomena
such as nucleon superposition. Finally, the impact on Orch-OR is addressed
in Section 7. It is shown that the decoherence times calculated in [12] are
greatly aﬀected by such a supposition. Should extra dimensions exist and be
of suﬃciently large scale, the Orch-OR scenario could suﬀer serious setbacks.
Before proceeding, it should be emphasized from the outset that the anal-
ysis herein is based on a combination of both hypothetical and arguably
untraditional models (Orch-OR), as well as accepted but untested theory
(large extra dimensions). For the sake of this argument, it is assumed that
the Orch-OR model is correct. The cautious reader should thus approach the
paper as an exercise in academic discourse and open-minded speculation.

2 A summary of the debate: Orch-OR or not

Orch-OR?

The “Orchestrated Objective Reduction” (Orch-OR) mechanism posits that
conscious “computation” does not take place in the classical neural circuitry
of the brain, but rather in the constituent molecules (microtubules) of the
cellular cytoskeleton. Microtubules are hollow, cylindrical structures whose
walls consist of 13 chains of the protein tubulin. These proteins can assume
two distinct physical conformations resulting from diﬀerent electric dipole
moments along their physical axis. Consequently, this “two-state” behavior
suggests that the tubulin protein is a prime candidate for a qubit. Penrose
[12] has proposed that each tubulin qubit can become entangled with other
local tubulin to form a superposition state. These superpositions are unstable
and subject to collapse, and the mechanism which drives this collapse has
been proposed to be that of Penrose [19, 20, 21], coined “objective reduction”.
The primary criticism of this model is that the brain is not an isolated
low temperature environment, and thus the decoherence of any macroscopic
entanglements would be eﬀectively instantaneous (∼ 10−20 sec) due to other
local quantum processes such as ion interactions [16]. This criticism is coun-
tered by arguing that the microtubules are suﬃcient shielded by molecular
and electrostatic considerations, thus the entangled states can survive for
macroscopic time intervals [22].

Furthermore, the authors of [12] suggest that well-known electrophysio-
logical “brain-wave” frequencies are signatures of the extended superposition
collapse. For example, they demonstrate that the Orch-OR mechanism allows
tubulin qubit superpositions to be maintained for as long as 25 microseconds,
corresponding to the 40 Hz thalamo-cortical coherent oscillation frequency.
This association (among others) has been oﬀered as evidence in support of
the quantum computing model for consciousness.

In the Orch-OR model, the culprit for the wavefunction collapse is gravity.
Penrose [19, 20] has postulated that gravitational interactions between the
diﬀerent physical conﬁguration of each qubit eigenstate introduces a type
of time-energy uncertainty relationship. This ultimately limits the duration
that a state can remain in superposition, and is discussed in detail in the
next section.

3 The physical foundations of Objective Re-

duction

The Objective Reduction (OR) mechanism is a potential solution to the
measurement problem between the two (or more) possible eigenstates of an
evolving wavefunction, |Ψi = α|ψ1i+β|ψ2i. A complete derivation of the OR
mechanism will not be reproduced here, but can be found in References [19,
20, 21]. Similar collapse schemes have been proposed by other authors [23,
24, 25, 26], but will not be discussed in the present context1. A review of
four distinct interpretations of such collapse mechanisms may be found in
[27].

The theory proposes that each eigenstate in the superposition possesses
a conformationally-distinct physical orientation. The overlap of both con-
formations will have a small but relevant impact on the local curvature of
spacetime. The net result is that there will be two distinct spacetime cur-
vatures in superposition with one another. Each curvature can be repre-
sented by a quantum state |Gii, correlated with the eigenstate |ψii, and thus
the actual particle wavefunction will be represented by the entanglement
|ψ1i|G1i + β|ψ2i|G2i. The geometric superposition creates an ill-deﬁnition
of the time-like Killing vector, ∂/∂t, which will ultimately lead to the col-
lapse. Simply put, each eigenstate will follow its own unique free-fall vector,
simultaneously violating the weak equivalence principle.

It can be shown that this “instability” in the superposition is limited
by an upper bound on the gravitational interaction energy between the two
eigenstate conformation states. Assuming the separation of each state (∆r)
exceeds their own physical extent, this is simply the Newtonian energy

E∆ ∼

Gm2

,

(1)

The states can just as easily overlap physically, although the calculation
becomes more complicated. The collapse time of the spacetime superposition
is determined by the uncertainty relation

and thus is inversely proportional to the gravitation energy of the system.
This result is a consequence of the framework in [23], as well as the alter-
nate derivation in [19, 20, 21], and the interested reader is directed to these
References for a complete review of the foundations.

Hence, in this scheme a nucleon of mass 10−27 kg whose superpositions are
separated by the strong interaction scale of 10−15 m will remain superposed
for Tc ∼ 1015 seconds (or about 107 years), whereas a possible macroscopic
superposition having larger E∆ will decay relatively quickly. For example, if a
speck of dust (m ∼ 10−6 kg) evolves into superposed states that are separated
by 0.01 mm, the wavefunction would collapse in well under 10−16 seconds.

4 Orchestrated Objective Reduction

Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR) is the application of the OR
formalism to superpositions of entangled tubulin “qubits” in the cellular cy-
toskeleton. Using this rationale, the authors of [12] have calculated a variety
of constraints on the nature of tubulin structures in which conscious quan-
tum computations could be realized. Various electrophysiological frequencies
are known to exist in the brain – most notably the 40 Hz thalamo-cortical
coherent oscillations (∆t = 25 ms), 10 Hz alpha rhythm EEG (∆t = 100 ms),
and Libet’s pre-conscious 2 Hz sensory threshold (∆t = 500 ms) [12]. If this
period ∆t corresponds to the collapse time for tubulin qubit entanglements,
then it can be reasoned that ∆E ∼ ¯h
∆t ≈ 10−15 eV is the required grav-
itational self-energy which must be attained by the system for the longest
period of 500 ms. This implies that N qubits possessing an OR energy E0
must be entangled together, where ∆E = NE0.

In order to estimate the self-energy E0 of one tubulin superposition, it
has been suggested [12] that the most appropriate conformation states are
those in which a carbon-12 nucleus is superposed within its own atomic
radius (a ∼ 2.5 × 10−15 meters). In this case, the self-energy term becomes
Gm2
a ∼ 10−28 eV, and thus N = ∆E/E0 ∼ 1013 carbon atoms, or
C
E0 =
1014 nucleons. Since each microtubule is composed of µ ∼ 105 nucleons, this
implies that NT ∼ 109 tubulin are required for a conscious instance. This
corresponds to roughly 100 neurons, each containing 107 tubulin [28].

Combining these into one single expression, it can be concluded that
the number of microtubulin NT required to form a ∆t second pre-conscious

5 Large Extra Spatial Dimensions

It is a long-standing supposition in theoretical physics that our Universe
might contain more that the traditional three spatial dimensions. The initial
proposal made by Kaluza [29] and later by Klein [30] posited that a (4+1)-
dimensional metric could help unify the fundamental ﬁelds of gravitation
and electromagnetism. This extra dimension has traditionally assumed to
be compactiﬁed with a small radius R ≪ 1, which has until recently been
taken to be of the Planck length (> 10−35 m).

The emergence of theories of large extra dimensions (LEDs) in the late
1990s relaxed the constraint that the size of any additional spatial dimensions
must be Planck order (see [17, 18] for their pioneering works). Although in-
troduced initially as a solution to the hierarchy problem, LED theories have
found numerous applications in the ﬁelds of particle physics and cosmology,
including candidates for missing energy in GeV-scale accelerator collisions
[31], cosmic ray ﬂux spectra anomalies [32], and dark energy phenomenol-
ogy [33]. This manuscript will deal only with compactiﬁed Kaluza-Klein-like
ADD extra dimensions [17], and not the Randall-Sundrum “warped” dimen-
sions [18].

The energy scale (or temperature) at which gravity is expected to unify
with the other fundamental forces is exceedingly large, MP l ∼ 16 TeV. Such
energies would have been present a brief fraction of a second after the Big
Bang (as a comparison, the present background energy of the Universe is in
the range of 10−4 eV). The large energy scale in turn explains the smallness
of the gravitational constant, since GN = M −2
P l . The underlying assumption
of LED theory is that the electroweak uniﬁcation scale MEW ≈ 1 TeV is
also the fundamental scale of gravitation M4+n in the full 4 + n dimensional
spacetime. Just as the electroweak coupling goes as m−2
EW , the “actual”
gravitational coupling (G4+n) is set by this new energy scale.

In 3 + n spatial dimensions, the Newtonian potential diﬀers from the
familiar 1/r form. If there are n extra compactiﬁed dimensions of scale size
Rn, then for distances r < Rn it can be shown (e.g. via Gauss’ Law) that

|φn(r)| ∼

G4+nm
rn+1

,

7

(4)

(up to some geometric constants) since the ﬁelds can now propagate in any
of the 3 + n spatial dimensions. Gravitational interactions in the full 4 + n
dimensional spacetime are mediated by the new coupling constant G4+n,
whose value is set by the TeV uniﬁcation scale. For small r, the strength
of gravitation becomes commensurate with the other fundamental forces,
particularly electromagnetism.

Gravity’s apparent weakness at macroscopic distances arises from the
fact that the range of inﬂuence of the extra dimensions is limited to some
distance Rn, which is just the dimensions’ compactiﬁcation scale. As a result,
the value of the traditional Newtonian constant GN is ﬁxed by the size and
number of the extra dimensions.

Continuity of the gravitational ﬁeld at r = Rn requires

G4+nm
Rn+1
n

∼

GN m
Rn

.

(5)

(6)

(7)

So a relationship between the two coupling constants may be derived as
G4+n ∼ Rn

nGN ,

which indicates that the value of the compactiﬁcation radius is

Rn ∼ 10

32
n

−19 meters

As counter-intuitive as the result may seem, the traditional laws of New-
tonian gravity might break down below this length scale. It can quickly be
shown that if large extra compactiﬁed dimensions exist, there must be more
than one. If n = 1, then R ∼ 1011 m, which would imply that deviations
from Newtonian gravity should be observed at scales of the order of the solar
system (which clearly they do not). Probing the cases n ≥ 2 has subse-
quently become a hot topic of research, ranging from the aforementioned
astrophysical observation and accelerator searches to high-precision table-
top laboratory experiments. Via Cavendish-like gravitation experiments, the
E¨otwash group [34] has determined that gravity behaves in the classical New-
tonian manner at scales as small as 200 µm, but a recent result has set this
limit further down to 100 nm [35].

6 Penrose-Di´osi OR with LEDs

Before addressing the eﬀect of possible LEDs on something so contrived as
the Orch-OR mechanism, their inﬂuence on basic quantum mechanics is ﬁrst

8

addressed. In a recent paper [36], it was demonstrated that the existence of
LEDs can have measurable impact on nucleon collapse times described by
Penrose’s orchestrated reduction paradigm2

Assuming a nucleon wavefunction evolves such that the physical confor-
mations of two eigenstates are separated by a distance on par with the radius
of the nucleon itself (10−15 m), collapse times in the presence of LEDs be-
come much shorter than the 1015 seconds predicted in Reference [19].
In
fact, if there are between n = 2 and 3 dimensions of compactiﬁcation scale
R2 ∼ 10−3 m to R3 ∼ 10−9 m, the nucleon wavefunction will collapse in under
10−5 seconds. This short superposition time would destroy the quantum me-
chanical nature of the nucleons, and thus would have observable consequences
for neutron diﬀraction. Thus, these cases are ruled out by experiment.

If there are 4 or 5 dimensions of scale 10−11 m and 10−13 m respectively,
the collapse time increases to between 0.01-10 seconds. These case again
could easily be veriﬁed experimentally, and the result could serve to constrain
the LED mechanism (if Penrose’s initial collapse scheme is correct). The
cases n = 6 to n = 8 are of interest, because the nucleon collapse times
increase from 107 seconds to 1015 seconds. It would be diﬃcult to test whether
or not a nucleon may be superposed for more than a year without succumbing
to collapse, and thus it leaves the question open as to whether or not these
LED parameters are physically viable.

7 Orch-OR with LEDs

Since particles separated by distances less than the compactiﬁcation radius
of any LEDs will experience “stronger” gravity, there could be signiﬁcant
consequences for the Orch-OR mechanism. Modifying the Penrose-Hameroﬀ
derivation from Section 4, the reduction is now calculated using a potential
function of the form in Equation 4.

Equation 3 can be modiﬁed to include LEDs by the replacement G −→

G4+n, and a −→ an+1, giving

NT ∼

¯han+1
µG4+nm2
c

(8)

2The idea that LEDs could inﬂuence gravitation collapse schemes was anecdotally men-

tioned in Reference [26].

9

Table 10 shows calculated values of NT for n = 2 through n = 7 extra dimen-
sions. The three neural frequencies mentioned in Section 4 are considered,
which correspond to collapse times of 25 ms, 100 ms, and 500 ms. Addition-
ally, a fourth frequency is also included which represents a 5 ms neural signal
speciﬁc to human beings (see [12]) requiring 1011 tubulin with regular New-
tonian gravity. The case n = 1 is excluded because of the aforementioned
astrophysical constraints, and n ≥ 8 are also excluded because the size Rn
drops below the mass separation (and thus regular Newtonian gravity would
resume at about this point). Experimental tests of Newton’s inverse square
law [34] have eﬀectively ruled out extra dimensions above a few hundred
microns (10−4 m) in size, so it is also unlikely that n = 2 is valid.

For the cases where 3 ≤ n ≤ 5, a very startling result is observed. Since
gravity is so much stronger than normal at distances r ≪ Rn, the self-energy
of a single nucleon superposition is larger than the total required energy
∆E. For instance, if there are n = 3 extra dimensions whose scale size is
roughly 1 nm, the ratio of the superposition self-energy of a single nucleon to
the total energy required for a 500 ms collapse would be E3/∆E ∼ 106. The
corresponding number of tubulin required for the 100 ms and 25 ms scenarios
are also unphysical for these cases. Thus, if there are indeed 5 or less extra
dimensions of the variety described by the ADD theory, then it is virtually
impossible for this mechanism to be responsible for conscious correlates (as
described by Penrose and Hameroﬀ). However, as discussed in the previous
section, these cases would also be ruled out by experiment.

If there are seven or more extra dimensions, then their length scale size
drops below the separation of the carbon nuclei in the protein qubits, and
one would expect “regular” gravity to take over (as suggested by the reported
data). However, it is just below this value of n that the implications of Orch-
In a universe with n = 6 extra dimensions of scale
OR become striking.
R6 ∼ 10−14 meters, the number of tubulin qubits NT becomes physically-
realizable. This number, however, is exceedingly small, on the order of a few
hundred for the 500 ms case. This number increases by order of magnitude
with decreasing ∆t, giving NT ∼ 103 tubulin for 100 ms and NT ∼ 104 for
25 ms. In this case, it would imply that eﬀectively all biological organisms
containing tubulin cytoskeletons are conscious, since as previously mentioned
typical neuron contains 107 tubulin! Thus, even microscopic organisms with
a relatively small number of neurons would be conscious. While philosophers
might be extremely intrigued by this conclusion which opens the doors for a
re-evaluation of a being’s self-awareness, the likelihood of this being a reality

10

is, to say the least, suspect.

8 Variation of TeV scale

The values in Table 10 assume that the uniﬁcation scale is M4+n ∼ 1 TeV.
However, there is nothing to suggest that it cannot be slightly larger than
this. Table 10 demonstrates how the values might change if M4+n shifted
by a few orders of magnitude and instead is M4+n ∼ 10δ TeV. The main
eﬀect of raising the uniﬁcation scale is to make the compactiﬁcation scale of
dimensions smaller.

Table 10 shows how the number of tubulin required for the constant
instances of Table 10 might change if δ = 2 (i.e. a uniﬁcation scale of
100 TeV). Note that now only the Orch-OR mechanism will be aﬀected for
only up to n = 4 extra dimensions before the compactiﬁcation scale drops
below the carbon nuclei superposition separation a.
In fact, if there are
2 or 3 extra dimensions (1 is still ruled out by macroscopic gravitational
phenomena) the OR framework again cannot be the driving mechanism of
state collapse.

9 Evolution of consciousness and time depen-

dent LEDs

In Reference [12] a discussion of evolution and the emergence of consciousness
was raised, based on the estimation of 109 tubulin required for pre-conscious
processing. There is increasing observational evidence that the value of New-
ton’s constant G has changed over the evolution of the Universe to present
day (see References [37, 38] for a pre-LED and post-LED discussion of time-
dependent compactiﬁcation radii). From Equation 6, it can be deduced that
a time-dependent constant G(t) varies as R(t)−n. So, depending on whether
G(t) is getting bigger or smaller with time can be related to the changing
scale size of the extra dimensions.

In fact, it can easily be shown that if G(t) is getting bigger, then R(t)
must be getting smaller. If the Orch-OR mechanism is correct, then the im-
plications for conscious emergence are striking. As has been shown in this
analysis, large values of R imply either unphysical interpretations of Orch-
OR, or alternatively that conscious processes require only a few microtubulin

11

strands. This could suggest that pre-evolutionary microbes possessed con-
scious though (depending on the initial size of R(t), that is). Conversely, a
shrinking value of G(t) implies that the scale R(t) is getting larger over time,
implying that over large time scales more organic entities will eventually
achieve consciousness.

Of course, the time scales required for a signiﬁcant change in the value of
G(t) are on the order of a fraction of the age of the Universe, which most likely
would surpass the “biological” time of species on the Earth. Indeed, it has
been shown that the compactiﬁcation radii have grown by less than a factor of
ten in size over the history of the solar system [36]. Also, the variation of G(t)
is also independent of the possible existence of extra dimensions. Hence, the
associated impact on such quantum mechanical brain processes would still
be relevant, and thus opens intriguing speculation on how intelligence might
have evolved elsewhere in the early Universe.

10 Conclusions

This article has examined the compatibility of Penrose and Hameroﬀ’s or-
chestrated objective reduction model for consciousness in light of the possible
existence of large extra compactiﬁed spatial dimensions of the ADD variety.
Since the basis of the objective reduction model is explicitly gravitational
and Newtonian, the presence of LEDs and TeV gravity will signiﬁcantly al-
ter the conclusions drawn in Reference [12]. In fact, for extra dimensions of
scale size less that ∼ 10−14 m the Orch-OR model becomes an incomplete
theory. The required number of tubulin to maintain the observed conscious
frequencies are either outrageously small, or even unphysical (NT < 1).

The greatest test of TeV-gravity and LEDs will begin in 2007 when the
Large Hadron Collider is brought on-line. The accelerator will problem en-
ergy scales well above the TeV boundary, and as such will provide an exciting
glimpse at a range of possible new physics which exists in and beyond this
energy range. If extra dimensions exist and are large compared to the Planck
scale, their existence is expected to be conﬁrmed. If they do exist, then the
Orch-OR model is incomplete or incorrect. If they do not, then the mystery
of consciousness and its connection to quantum gravity is possibly one step
closer to being explained.

Table 1: The number of tubulin proteins required for an orchestrated reduc-
tion of ∆t = 5, 25, 100, and 500 ms duration in Universes with n extra dimen-
sions. The case n = 1 is ruled out by the observed behavior of macroscopic
gravity, while the cases n > 7 would reproduce the “standard” Orch-OR
results.

Table 2: The number of tubulin proteins required for an orchestrated re-
duction of ∆t = 5, 25, 100, and 500 ms duration in Universes with n extra
dimensions in which the gravitational uniﬁcation scale is 100 TeV. The size
of each dimension Rn is smaller than those in Table 1, and thus regular
Newtonian gravity is recovered at the tubulin length scales for smaller n.

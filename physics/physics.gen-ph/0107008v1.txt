Inertia is deﬁned axiomatically. The gravitational ﬁeld is caused by the ﬂow of intergalactic
masses. Origin of space and time are connected with ﬁelds. The cosmos is bounded by inertia and
gravitation, which is the sequence of existence of two ﬁelds, the inertial ﬁeld and the gravic ﬁeld as
a vortex ﬁeld.Gravic and inertial ﬁeld combine to a unit, the gravo-inertial ﬁeld. The separation in
gravic and inertial components depend on the coordinate system of motion.

Well known models like ”steady state theory”, Einstein cosmos, Friedman cosmos are although the last expanding,
”static” models, strong determined by geometry or rigid attemptions. The gravitational ﬁeld is given, but no created.
The deforming of space and time is necessary because given at the beginning. This may be the analog and appropriate
way with a mathematical method describe a physical problem. We tried to explain background with considering the
results of the mechanics of H. Hertz, V. Fock and the the epistemological considerations of G. W. Leibniz We will
outline in condensed summary our investigations about gravitation and inertia.

II. AXIOMATIC

1. Law of inertia mass

2. Conservation law

3. Special theory of relativity

4. Continuity principle

5. Creation of time and space by ﬁeld and vice versa

6. Gravo-inertial ﬁeld equations

The priciples 1, 2 and 3 are well proved. We outline 5 and 6 considering 3. Starting point are the existence of mass
and inertia. Mass is existent by space (extent) and time (motion).M otion and density change is inﬂuenced by two
ﬁelds, ﬁrst ( ~K) arised by inertia, second ( ~G) by gravitation, the later conditioned by motion and density change
(enlargement).

III. EXPERIMENTAL

The cosmos is at present expanding with deﬁnit velocity and accelleration. The equality of gravitational and inertial
mass is assumed proved. The background radiation is a characteristic of an earlier state. The present state is a result
of development. Gravitation can assumed as an eﬀect of higher order. There is a strange numeric relation between
electricity and gravitation of the electron. The repulsion of two electrons is 1040 times of the attraction as the result
of gravitation, the rules are similar.

IV. GRAVO-INERTIAL FIELD EQUATIONS

The gravo-inertial ﬁeld equations can be written in MKS-System as

∇ · ~K = − ∂̺
∂t

+ · · ·+higher orders

∇ · ~G = 0

c2∇ × ~G = − ∂~j
∂t

+ · · ·+higher orders

∇ × ~K = − ∂ ~G
∂t

where
~j [kg/m2s] mass ﬂow (in an isotropic world radial to the reference system)

ρ mass density [kg/cm3]
~K ∼ ~j [kg/m2s] inertial ﬁeld strength
~G [kg/m3] gravic ﬁeld strength

Equations (1)- (4) represents a linear partial diﬀerential equation system. The ﬁelds are created not by existence
but by changing of mass density and mass ﬂow by space and time.In this formal sense the gravo-inertial ﬁeld equations
have an analogy in electromagnetics (Maxwell equations).
The gravic ﬁeld ~G and the gravitational force ~F of a test particle is proportional to its mass m. If we imaginate to
stop the cosmos expansion, then the gravic ﬁeld vanishes. Therefore there is a gravic ﬁeld around the particle as
result of changed density of the world by ﬂow and there is a global attraction of all particles to each other.

From this force results the gravitational force (in analogy to Lorentz force) from the rotational ﬁeld strength ~G,

which is proportional to the mass of the particle

with
τ [m4/skg] as an appropriate constant
~F gravitational force
~v the velocity of cosmical masses summed by all masses in all directions
τ a cosmological time dependent constant.

Because the masses are moved relatively to a particle on x it suﬀers a force perpendicular to the velocity ~v. The

system is rotational-symmetric, homogeneous and isotropic.
If all masses unmoved, then ~G = 0.
The inertial ﬁeld ~K cause a gravitational ﬁeld ~G, on the other hand ~G arises ~K.
We can introduce the common potentials ϕ and ~A

If the cosmos expands then there is the energy concentrated in the moved masses and give rise to the term on the
right of equation 1. From the expanding space and time and the mass ﬂow change by time follows the creation of a ﬁeld
that contradict the expansion (equation 3). Both ﬁelds are connectes by the equation 3 und 4. The analogy to Maxwell
theory is obviously. In analog way we assume the separation in gravic and inertial part by four dimensional vector.
We obtain a force action. The Lorentz force correspond the gravitational force ~F . We recognize the gravitational
ﬁeld as consequequence of relativiy principle. In this way the gravic ﬁeld on point x is a relativistic eﬀect and local
transformable. In common sense the ﬁeld can only removed by stopping (transforming) of all cosmic masses in rest
reference system.
If the cosmos contract then the gravitation is directed away from the masses. Corresponding
principle of continuity the cosmos is oscillating. The expanding masses are creating space, time and gravitation.
Gravitational and inertial mass are identically, one is the cause of the other.

V. CONCLUSION

The creation of space and time are connected with ﬁelds, only the masses and the rule of inertia are given. All
processes in nature are determinded by interacting ﬁelds or particles, by two energy forms or in common in twofold
way. This state of cosmos is an instantaneous value which is determined by interaction. Gravitation is not determined
by masses but is in a sense the result of expanding and creating space and time. In this process is created inertial
ﬁeld strength ~K connected with a gravitational ﬁeld strength ~G. Because the density change is cause for creation of
gravitational ﬁeld, the force on particles is proportional to ist masses. The drifting masses produce a ”guiding ﬁeld”
which is with expansion or contraction radial directed.

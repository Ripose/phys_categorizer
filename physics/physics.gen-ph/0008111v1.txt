Abstract

We reconsider the valuation of barrier options by means of binomial trees from
a “forward looking” prospective rather than the more conventional “backward
induction” one used by standard approaches. Our reformulation allows us to
write closed-form expressions for the value of European and American put
barrier-options on a non-dividend-paying stock.

I. INTRODUCTION

Closed-form valuation within the Black-Scholes-Merton equilibrium pricing theory [1,2]
is only possible for a small subset of ﬁnancial derivatives. In the majority of cases one must
appeal to numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, or ﬁnite diﬀerence methods
and much of the eﬀort in the ﬁeld has been in developing eﬃcient algorithms for numerically
solving the Black-Scholes equation [3]. An alternative direction has been the evaluation
of discrete-time, discrete-state stochastic models of the market on binomial and trinomial
trees [4,5]. Not only is this discrete approach intuitive and easily accessible to a less mathe-
matically sophisticated audience; but it also seems to us to be a more accurate description
of market dynamics and better suited for evaluating more involved ﬁnancial instruments.
Moreover, the few exact Black-Scholes results available can be recovered in the appropriate
continuous-time trading limit. The main diﬃculty in pricing with binomial trees has been
the non-monotonic numerical convergence and the dramatic increase in computational eﬀort
with increasing number of time steps [6,7]. For example, the state of the art calculations
involve memory storage scaling linearly (quadratically) with the number of time steps, N,
for European (American) options, while the computation time increases like N 2 in both
cases [8].

In this paper we reconsider valuation on binomial trees from what we call a “forward look-
ing” prospective: we imagine acting as well-educated consumers who attempt to eliminate
risk and estimate the value of an option by looking at its future expected values according
to some reasonable dynamical model. As will be described in great detail below the main
intuitive idea of our computations is to regard the movement of the price on the tree as a
random walk (with statistical properties consistent with a risk-neutral world) with “walls”
imposed by the nature of the option, such as the possibility of early exercise (American op-
tions) or the presence of barriers. Our mathematical formulation then has two conceptually
distinct components: the ﬁrst ingredient is an explicit description of the possible “walls”.
For example, in the case of barrier American options both the barrier and the “early ex-
ercise” surface need to be speciﬁed. The second step will be to compute the probability
that the price reaches particular values at every accessible point on the tree. This involves
counting the number of paths reaching that point in the presence of “walls”, a somewhat
involved but exactly solvable combinatorics problem. Once these two steps (specifying the
walls and computing the probabilities) are accomplished the value of both European and
American options, with and without barriers, can be written down explicitly. In an attempt
to be pedagogical, we will limit ourselves to the simplest cases: we will only treat Euro-
pean, simple American and European with a straight “up-and-out” barrier. Although the
calculation can be simply extended to the barrier American option that discussion merits a
separate publication.

We note that, as far as we know, in the case of trees explicit formulas like the ones
we are proposing exist in the literature only in the simplest case of conventional European
options [5,9]. For the more complicated case of American options, the main issues are best
summarized in the last chapter of Neil Chriss’ book [10]: “The true diﬃculty in pricing
American options is determining exactly what the early exercise boundary looks like. If we
could know this a priori for any option (e.g., by some sort of formula), we could produce
pricing formulas for American options.” Below we propose a solution to this problem in the

2

context of binomial trees. Our formulation complements the earlier studies of American
options in the limit of continuous-time trading [11–13] which also focus on the presence of
an early exercise boundary for the valuation of path-dependent instruments. The study of
the continuum limit of our formulas is instructive and will be left for a future publication.

II. BINOMIAL TREES

To establish notation we begin by dividing the life of an option, T , into N time intervals
of equal length, τ = T /N. We assume that at each discrete time ti = iτ (i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N)
the stock price moves from its initial value, S0 = S(t0 = 0), to one of two new values: either
up to S0u (u > 1) or down to S0d (d < 1) [8]. This process deﬁnes a tree with nodes labeled
by a two dimensional vector, (i, j) (i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N; j = 0, 1, ..., i) and characterized by a
stock price S(i, j) = S0ujdi−j, the price reached at time ti = iτ after j up and i − j down
movements, starting from the original price S0. The probability of an up (down) movement
will be denoted by pu (pd = 1 − pu); and thus each point on the tree is also characterized by
the probability, pj
u(1 − pu)i−j, which represents the probability associated with a single path
of i time steps, j (i−j) of which involve an increase (decrease) in the stock price. Computing
the probability of connecting the origin with point (i, j) requires, in addition to the single
path probability, a factor counting the number of such possible paths in the presence of a
barrier and/or the possibility of early exercise. The calculation of this degeneracy factor
involves the details of each ﬁnancial derivative and it will be discussed in turn for each of
our examples.

The binomial tree model introduces three free parameters, u, d and pu. Two of these are
usually ﬁxed by requiring that the important statistical properties of the random process
deﬁned above, such as the mean and variance, coincide with those of the continuum Black-
Scholes-Merton theory [3]. In particular,

puu + (1 − pu) d = erτ

erτ (u + d) − ud − e2rτ = σ2τ,

(1)
(2)

where r is the risk-free interest rate, and the volatility, σ, is a measure of the variance of
the stock price. We are left with one free parameter which can be chosen to simplify the
theoretical analysis; one might choose, for example, u = 1/d [4], which simpliﬁes the tree
geometry by arranging that an up motion followed by a down motion leads to no change in
the stock price. This condition together with (1) and (2) imply:

u = eσ√τ
d = e−σ√τ

pu =

erτ − d
u − d

.

(3)
(4)

(5)

We stress that Equations (1-5) are to be regarded as short-time approximations where terms
higher order in τ were ignored.

With these deﬁnitions out of the way we can begin discussing the valuation of put options

with strike price X and expiration time T .

3

A. European Put Options

The simple European put option is a good illustration of our “forward looking” approach.
We are interested in all those paths on the tree which, at expiration time i = N, reach a
price, S(N, j) = S0ujdN−j < X, for which the option should be exercised. That implies that
j ≤ j∗ = Int [ln(X/S0dN )/ ln(u/d)], where Int refers to the integer part of the quantity in
square brackets. The mean value of the option at expiration can then be written as a sum
over all values of j ≤ j∗ of the payoﬀ at j, X − S0ujdN−j, multiplied by the probability of
realizing the price S(N, j) = S0ujdN−j after N time steps, P [N, j]. As already mentioned
above, P [N, j] = ℵE[N, j]pj
u(1 − pu)N−j, where ℵE[N, j] counts the number of paths starting
at the origin and reaching the price S(N, j) in N time steps. For the case of conventional
European options this is just the number of paths of N time steps, with j up and N − j
down movements of the price, and is thus given by the binomial coeﬃcient,

ℵE[N, j] =   N

j ! =

N!

j!(N − j)!

.

(6)

The resulting expression for the mean value of the option at maturity is then discounted
to the time of contract by the risk-free interest rate factor, e−rT , to determine the current
expected value of the option:

j ∗

¯VE = e−rT

Xj=0  N

j ! pj

u(1 − pu)N−j(cid:16)X − S0ujdN−j(cid:17) .

(7)

This expression is not new:
it was ﬁrst discussed by Cox and Rubinstein [5] who also
showed that in the appropriate continuous trading-time limit (τ → 0) (7) reduces to the
Black-Scholes result [1].

B. European Put Barrier Options

We are now ready to extend (7) into an exact formula for the mean value of an European
put option with a barrier. Although our approach can be used for other barrier instruments,
we consider the simplest case of an “up-and-out” put option which ceases to exist when some
barrier price, H > S0, higher than the current stock is reached. With the choice u = 1/d an
explicit equation for the nodes of the tree which constitute the barrier can be written down:

S(jB + 1 + 2h, jB + 1 + h) = S0ujB+1+hdh,

h = 0, 1, ..., hB

(8)

Here, jB = Int [ln (H/S0) / ln(u)] deﬁnes the ﬁrst point just above the barrier, (jB +1, jB +1),
and hB labels the last relevant point on the barrier corresponding to the time closest to the
maturity of the option, i.e., hB = Int t[(N − jB − 1)/2].

Since the probability that any allowed path starting with the present stock price, S0,
u(1 − pu)N−j (with j ≤ j∗) the

reaches an exercise price at maturity, S(N, j) < X, is still pj
average value of the European barrier option can be written in a form similar to (7):

¯VEB = e−rT

j ∗

Xj=0

ℵEB[N, j] pj

u(1 − pu)N−j(cid:16)X − S0ujdN−j(cid:17) ,

(9)

4

where ℵEB[N, j] is the number of paths N time-steps long involving j up and N − j down
movements of the price excluding those paths reaching any of the points on or above the
barrier (8). As we will explain below, ℵEB[N, j] is given by

ℵEB[N, j] =   N

j ! −

hM

Xh=0

ℵres

EB[jB + 1 + 2h, jB + 1 + h]  N − jB − 1 − 2h

j − jB − 1 − h ! ,

(10)

where the second term on the right-hand side represents the contribution from the unwanted
paths which hit the barrier (8) before reaching an exercise point (N, j).

To understand the form of the excluded contribution in (10) we ﬁrst note that reaching
the excluded region requires that the path hits the barrier at least once. Thus in counting
the excluded paths we can simply focus on those paths reaching the barrier. One might
think that the number of unwanted paths can then be calculated by (i) counting the number
of paths connecting the origin to a given point on the barrier; (ii) multiplying this by the
number of paths connecting that point on the barrier with the exercise point (N, j) [14];
and ﬁnally (iii) summing over all points of the barrier (8). This seems correct except that
all paths connecting a barrier point with (N, j) already include those paths which have
already hit the barrier once or more before reaching the given barrier point. To eliminate
overcounting we must make sure that in (i) we only include paths reaching the particular
point on the barrier without having previously visited any other point on the barrier. The
number of such restricted paths (reaching the point (jB + 1 + 2h, jB + 1 + h)) is denoted by
ℵres
EB[jB + 1 + 2h, jB + 1 + h]. Finally note that the ﬁnal sum over the length of the barrier
is restricted to h ≤ hM = min(hB, j − jB − 1) with j ≥ jB + 1, corresponding to the fact
that, in general, the exercise point (N, j) cannot be reached from all points on the barrier.
This completes our explanation of (10).
We are then left with computing ℵres

EB. From its very deﬁnition it is not hard to see that

ℵres

EB[h] ≡ ℵres

E [jB + 1 + 2h, jB + 1 + h] satisﬁes the following recursion relation:

ℵres

EB[0] = 1

ℵres

EB[h] =   jB + 1 + 2h

jB + 1 + h ! −

h−1

Xl=0

ℵres

h ≥ 1,

(11)

(12)

with the sum in (12) removing contributions from previously visited barrier points. Obvi-
ously ℵres
EB[0] = 1 as there is a single path involving jB + 1 up moves connecting the origin
with the point (jB + 1, jB + 1) on the tree.

To solve Equations (11) and (12) we ﬁrst combine the sum on the right-hand side of
(12) with the term on the left and rewrite the resulting equation in the form of a discrete
convolution:

ℵres

EB[l]  2(h − l)

h − l ! =   jB + 1 + 2h

jB + 1 + h ! ,

h

Xl=0

(13)

where the boundary condition, ℵEB[0] = 1, is already included as the h = 0 contribution
to (13). Note that (13) can be solved by standard Laplace transform (or Z-transform)
techniques [15]. Since in applying these ideas to the more complicated American options we
will lose the convolution form of (13) – the kernel will depend on h and l separately and not

5

only through the diﬀerence, h − l – we prefer to proceed in a more general way and stay in
“conﬁguration space” until the very end. We prefer to regard (13) as a matrix equation to
be solved by matrix inversion.

We proceed by reformulating (13) in the following matrix form:

LEBΠres

EB = DEB,

(14)

where ΠEB and DEB are hM + 1 dimensional vectors, with components ΠEB,h = ℵres

EB[h]

and DEB,h =   jB + 1 + 2h

jB + 1 + h !, h = 0, 1, 2, ..., hM , and the (hM + 1) × (hM + 1) dimensional

matrix, LEB, can be written as,

[LEB]h,l =   2(h − l)

h − l ! θ (h − l) .

(15)

Note that in (15) we have explicitly added a θ function (θ(x) = 1 for x ≥ 0 and vanishes
otherwise) to stress that LEB is a lower triangular matrix with unity along and zeros above
the diagonal. This simple observation allows us to rewrite (14) in the convenient form,

LEB = 1(hM +1)×(hM +1) + QEB,

(16)

where QE is a nilpotent matrix of order hM , QEB

y = 0 for y ≥ hM + 1; and [QEB]h.l =
h − l ! θ(h − l − 1). The nilpotent property of QEB allows us to write down the explicit

  2(h − l)

solution for (14),

ΠEB = [1 + QEB]−1 DEB =

hM

(−1)RQR

EBDEB,

XR=0

which in turn leads to the following formula for the value of the option,

j − jB − 1 − h !hQR

EBih,l  jB + 1 + 2l
jB + 1 + l !

Note that the lower limit on the external sum, j = jB + 1, excludes all paths unaﬀected by
the presence of the barrier; also we have explicitly indicated the N and/or j dependence of
the various quantities involved; and have separated out the contribution to ℵEB[N, j] from
unrestricted paths (the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (10)) which simply leads to the
value of the European put option given in (7).

We expect that, since we have an analytical formula, we should be able to recover the
exact solution of the continuum Black-Scholes theory for this simplest of barrier options [16]
as was already done for conventional European puts [5]. Figure 1 shows the numerical
convergence of the binomial value of a representative “up-and-out” European put option to
its analytic value [16].

The same general idea used in the case of European barrier options will now be used to
write down an exact formula for the price of a simple American option, regarding the latter
as an option with an early-exercise barrier.

C. Conventional American Put Options

Using this view to valuate American options requires the knowledge of those points
on the tree where it ﬁrst becomes proﬁtable to exercise the option. This set of points,
parameterized as (i, jx[i]), constitute the “early exercise barrier” (EXB). Determining the
explicit form of the surface, jx[i], seems very diﬃcult (if at all possible) as it already implies
a knowledge of the mean value of the option at some ﬁnite number of points on the tree. In
this section we show that there is a self-consistent exact formulation of the problem which
proceeds in the following three steps: (i) we assume that the early exercise surface, jx[i] is
given and compute an explicit formula for the value of the option at each point on the tree,
f (i, j; jx[i]), which depends parametrically on jx[i]; (ii) the fact that early exercise at (i, j)
only occurs when X −S0ujdi−j ≥ f (i, j; jx[i]) gives us an explicit formula for the EXB which
corresponds to the strict equality,

(cid:16)X − S0u˜j[i;jx[i]]di−˜j[i;jx[i]](cid:17) = f (i, jx[i]);

jx[i] = Intn˜j[i; jx[i]o .

(20)

[Note that, on the right-hand side of (20) we have not used f (i, ˜j[i]) which might appear
at ﬁrst sight as a more natural choice for deﬁning the EXB. As will become clear below,
(20) is the simplest and most natural choice which resolves the ambiguity of deﬁning f (i, j)
away from points on the tree.] Finally, (iii) substituting the solution (20) into the formally
exact valuation expression gives us the value of the option. Although this strategy leads to
an exact solution of the price of an American option, explicit numbers require rather heavy
numerical computations except in the simplest example of a straight EXB.

Let us proceed in carrying out the program outlined above by assuming that the EXB,
i.e., jx[i], is explicitly given. To begin our calculation we will need some very general
properties of the barrier. These follow from two simple characteristics of early exercise: (i)
if the point (i, j) is an early exercise point, then so are all points “deeper in-the-money”,
(i, j′), j′ = 0, 1, ..., j − 1; and (ii) if two adjacent points at the same time step, (i + 1, j + 1)
and (i + 1, j), are both early exercise points so is the point (i, j).
(The latter property
follows from a conventional “backwardation” argument [3] which indicates that the average
expected payoﬀ at (i, j), discounted at the risk-free interest rate, is smaller than the actual
payoﬀ, thus making (i, j) itself an early exercise point.) It is not hard to see that (i) and (ii)
guarantee that the inner part of the early exercise region cannot be reached without crossing
the EXB. Thus, if we deﬁne iA to be the ﬁrst time for which early exercise becomes possible
and parametrize the points on the EXB as (i = iA + h, jx[iA + h]) with h = 0, 1, 2, ..., N − iA,
it then follows that jx[iA] = 0. Moreover, the structure of the tree ensures that jx[i] is a
nondecreasing function of i; more precisely, for each time step, jx[i] either increases by one
or remains the same.

The formal expression for the price of an American option can be written down once
one recognizes that once a path hits the EXB the option expires and thus any point on
the barrier can be reached at most once. As a result, the value of the option is a sum of
(appropriately discounted) payoﬀs along the barrier, weighted by the probability of reaching
each point on the barrier without having visited the barrier at previous times. We can then
write the expected value of an American option as:

where the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side counts the total number of unrestricted paths
from the origin to the point (iA + h, jx[iA + h]) on the barrier, while the second term excludes
those paths which, before reaching (iA + h, jx[iA + h]) visited any of the previous barrier
points, (iA + l, jx[iA + l]), l = 0, 1, 2, ..., h − 1 [14].

As in the case of the European barrier option (23) is rewritten as a matrix equation:

LAΠres

A = DA.

(24)

Here ΠA and DA are N − iA + 1 dimensional vectors, with components ΠA,h = ℵres

A [h] and

DA,h =   iA + h

jx[iA + h] !, h = 0, 1, 2, ..., N − iA, and the (N − iA + 1) × (N − iA + 1) dimensional

matrix, LA, takes the form,

[LA]h,l =  

h − l

jx[iA + h] − jx[iA + l] ! ,

l ≤ h = 0, 1, 2, ..., N − iA.

(25)

Note that, in contrast to (15) and (16), LA depends on the indices h and l separately; also,

we have used the identities jx[iA] = 0 and   iA

jx[iA] ! = 1, to incorporate the boundary

condition, ℵres

A [0] = 1, in (24) in a symmetric way. As in (16), we can decompose LA as,

[LA]h,l = δh,l + [QA]h,l

[QA]h,l =  

h − l

jx[iA + h] − jx[iA + l] ! θ (h − l − 1) ,

matrix of degree N − iA + 1. Thus,

(29)

One last step is the determination of f (i, j), the value of the American put at every point
(i, j) on the tree which, in turn, will allow us to derive the equation for the EXB. This is
easily done by simply translating the origin in (29):

(30)

Together with (20) this then leads to the rather formidable-looking equation for the barrier
height ˜j[iA + k] at the (iA + k)-th time step (k = 0, 1, ..., N − iA), as a functional of the
barrier position at all future time steps before expiration:

[It should now be clear that in (30) j must be restricted to points on the tree as the binomial

0

(31) and (32) for the boundary together with the formula for the value of the option, (29),
constitute an exact pricing strategy for a conventional American put. A similar formula for
an American put with an “up-and-out” barrier will be discussed in a future publication.

It is instructive to consider Equations (29), (31) and (32) in the explicitly solvable case of
a straight barrier. We begin with the observation that at expiration, k = N −iA, (31) reduces
to the deﬁnition of j∗ = Int[ln(X/S0dN )/ ln(u/d)], deﬁned in the case of the European option,
and thus, the barrier goes through the point (N, j∗) at expiration. Moreover, starting from
the exact point (N, j∗) on the barrier and decreasing jx[i] by one with each backward time
step we reach iA = N − j∗ along the straight line, jx[i] = i − N + j∗. Recall that, since with
each increasing time step, jx[i] either increases by one or remains the same, this straight line
represents a lower bound for the early exercise barrier.

For this straight barrier (28) and (29) reduce to,

We expect that the result for the true barrier should approach the straight line formula
for coarse enough time steps, τ > N −j∗ −iA, (where this iA is the ﬁrst time of early exercise
in the limit of continuous-time trading).

III. CONCLUSION

We have presented a scheme for pricing options with and without barriers on binomial
trees. To the best of our knowledge ours is the ﬁrst explicit derivation of exact formulas
treating barriers on binomial trees. It is our expectation that in the limit of continuous-
time trading we should be able to recover the few exact results available in the literature,
especially for American options [12,13]. We also hope that our explicit formulas may provide
a framework for improving the eﬃciency of numerical computations.

IV. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

[14] We recall that the number of paths between two arbitrary points on the tree, say (i, j)
and (i′, j′) (with i′ > i, j′ > j) is given by the binomial coeﬃcient, (i′ − i)!/[(j′ − j)!(i′ −
i − j′ + j)!].

FIG. 1.

Convergence to analytic value [16] of a three-month European “up-and-out” put
option on a non-dividend-paying stock as the number of binomial intervals N increases. The solid
line joining the squares is a guide to the eye. The stock price S0 is 60, the risk-free interest rate r
is 10%, and the volatility σ is 45%. The barrier level H is at 64. The analytic value (continuous
line) is 2.524. As a point of reference, we give the European put option value (i.e., H → ∞) 4.6
after the Black-Scholes solution (dashed line).

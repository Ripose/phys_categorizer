Abstract

A new internal description of fundamental fermions (quarks and lep-
tons), based on a matrix-generalization (F) of the scalar fermion-
number f , predicts that only three families of quarks and leptons, and
their associated neutrinos (νe, νµ and ντ ), exist. Moreover, this de-
scription places important topological constraints on neutrino mixing.
For example, with respect to F, the topology of the νe (νµ or ντ ) is that
of a cylinder (M¨obius strip). Assuming that a change in topology dur-
ing neutrino-neutrino transitions is suppressed (e.g., one cannot con-
tinuously deform a donut into a sphere), while neutrino-neutrino tran-
sitions without topology-change are (relatively) enhanced, one may
have an explanation for recent short-distance experimental observa-
tions of (nearly) maximal νµ-ντ mixing at the Super Kamiokande. To
test this idea, I was able to use simple topological arguments to deduce
a matrix describing long-distance neutrino mixtures, which is identical
to that proposed by Georgi and Glashow on diﬀerent grounds. Ex-
perimental conﬁrmation of this prediction would strongly support the
new description of fundamental fermions, which requires, among other
things, that the νe and (νµ or ντ ) neutrinos start life as topologically-
distinct quantum objects.

1.0 Introduction

Except where explicitly prevented by some “absolute” conservation law (e.g.,
the conservation of electric charge or spin angular momentum), quantum me-
chanics generally permits transitions between states having diﬀerent topolo-
gies [1]. While a change in topology may be energetically (or otherwise)
inhibited, unavoidable quantum ﬂuctuations are expected to catalyze such
processes. Hence, there is always the possibility of mixing between otherwise
similar states having distinct topologies [2].

Recently, a new internal description of fundamental fermions (quarks
and leptons) was proposed [3]. The new description is based on a matrix-
generalization F of the scalar fermion number f . One of the main predictions
of the new description is that only three families of quarks and leptons exist—
hence that there are only three low-mass neutrino ﬂavors, namely, the νe, νµ
and ντ neutrinos. Moreover, because of the way fundamental fermions are
represented by certain geometric objects in the space on which the matrix
transformation F acts [Ref. 3, p. 57 and pp. 85–87, Ref. 4, 5 and Ref. 6, pp.
244–255], the νe and (νµ or ντ ) neutrinos are found to have diﬀerent topolo-
gies with respect to F. This fact turns out to have important implications
for neutrino mixing.

With respect to the matrix transformation F, the topology of both the
νµ and ντ is found to be that of a M¨obius strip [Ref. 6, p. 143]. By contrast,
the topology of the νe (with respect F) is that of a cylinder. And because a
change in topology during transitions tends to be suppressed (e.g., one cannot
continuously deform a donut into a sphere) the foregoing topological distinc-
tions between neutrinos may help explain recent experimental observations
of (nearly) maximal νµ-ντ mixing at the Super Kamiokande facility [7]. The
purpose of this paper is to determine the constraints that these topological
distinctions place on long-distance neutrino mixtures, and by implication,
short-distance neutrino mixtures as well.

2.0 Topological Constraints on Neutrino Mix-

tures

In all conventional weak transitions, including neutral-current weak transi-
tions, the e µ and τ quantum numbers are additively conserved. Although
the observed neutrino mixing [7] violates these conservation laws, all transi-

2

tions of neutrinos from one ﬂavor to another (i.e., νl → νl′, l 6= l′) will tend
to be suppressed. In this paper we implicitly assume that this degree, and
kind, of suppression is the same for all νl → νl′, and therefore, that this eﬀect
can be completely ignored when discussing (relative) topological constraints
placed on long-distance neutrino mixtures.

2.1 Additional constraints on the matrix M

Given that the νe (νµ or ντ ) neutrino has the topology of a cylinder (M¨obius
strip) with respect to the internal transformation F, and assuming that topo-
logical constraints are the primary determinants of the matrix M describing
long-distance neutrino mixtures, the form of M is easily determined [8].
Moreover, these same topological constraints can be used to place numerical
bounds on the components of M. To accomplish these results we need only
apply the following very general principle to neutrino-neutrino transitions:

All other things being equal, any neutrino ﬂavor νl, (i.e., νe, νµ or ντ )
that undergoes neutrino-neutrino transitions involving a change in topology,
will tend to be suppressed, while neutrino-neutrino transitions involving no
change in topology will tend to be (relatively) enhanced.

To this principle we add the following corollary,

All other things being equal, because the νµ and ντ have the same topology,

they will act the same way in all neutrino-neutrino transitions.

Given these principles, we immediately have the following two constraints

on long-distance neutrino mixtures:

A. No matter what neutrino ﬂavor (νl) and topology one starts with at
some distant source (say a supernova), by the time the neutrino mixture
reaches its “equilibrium” state, it should contain equal fractions of νµ and
ντ , because these neutrinos have the same topology.

B. Because the νµ and ντ have the same topology, if one starts out with
either a pure νµ or a pure ντ source, one should end up with the same
long-distance equilibrium mixture of νe, νµ and ντ .

To describe A) and B) in conventional terms [9], let Dl be the number
of detected neutrinos of type νl and Bl be their number at “birth” at some
distant source. Then

{De, Dµ, Dτ} = M{Be, Bµ, Bτ},

where M is a 3×3 matrix of fractional coeﬃcients describing the long-distance
neutrino mixture, and { , , } are column “vectors”. By deﬁnition, all rows
and columns of M must sum to unity (100%), which means that Dl and Bl
must satisfy the constraint

De + Dµ + Dτ = Be + Bµ + Bτ .

(2)

2.2 The form of the matrix M

Constraints A) and B), together with Eqs. (1) and (2), dictate that the matrix
M describing long-distance neutrino mixtures must have the symmetrical
form

While topological constraints alone cannot determine the exact numerical
values of the matrix elements a, b and c, they can place numerical bounds
on these quantities. For example, because the νe is inhibited by its topology
from turning into a νµ or ντ , we naturally expect that (See Fig. 2.1)

Similarly, because the νµ and/or the ντ are inhibited by their topology from
turning into a νe, we naturally expect that (See Fig. 2.1)

a ≥ b.

(4)

c ≥ b.

(5)

Equations (4) and (5), together with the requirement that all rows and
columns of the matrix M in (1) and (3) sum to unity (i.e., a+2b = b+2c = 1),
further leads to the following bounds on a, b and c:

(

1
3 ≤ a ≤ 1),

(0 ≤ b ≤

1

),

(

1
3 ≤ c ≤

).

(6)

Moreover, since a + 2b = b + 2c, the arithmetic mean of a and b is c, i.e.,
(a + b)/2 = c, which means that c lies half-way between a and b. Hence, the
matrix elements a, b and c are subject to the constraint

a ≥ c ≥ b.

2.3 The Georgi-Glashow matrix M( 1
2)

The form of M speciﬁed in (3) and (8), together with the constraints provided
by (6) and (7), are completely consistent with the matrix proposed by Georgi

5

and Glashow [9] to describe long-distance neutrino mixtures, namely,

M( 1

2 ) =



.




(9)

This matrix can be viewed in two diﬀerent, but apparently complementary,
ways as being

1) The direct result of an assumed form for the neutrino mass-matrix (and
associated mixing parameters), and other factors dictated by requiring
consistency with the standard-model description of neutrinos, including
all known experimental properties of neutrinos. This is the point of
view espoused in [9],

and/or

2) The result of a balance between opposing topological and quantum
“forces” acting on neutrinos. This is the point of view espoused in the
present paper.

If 1) and 2) above are to be compatible points of view, then it follows
that such things as the neutrino mass-matrix is, in some sense, the result of
an interplay between opposing topological and quantum “forces” acting on
neutrinos. This conclusion would gain support if it were possible to derive the
matrix M without reference to the approach taken in [9]. Such a derivation
is presented in Section 3.0. But, before turning to the derivation of M, we
must ﬁrst examine the boundary conditions on this matrix.

2.4 Boundary conditions on M(a)

Consider the general matrix M(a) deﬁned on the boundaries of the physically
accessible region ( 1

In this case, topological constraints are eﬀectively nonexistent—topology

to unavoidable quantum-ﬂuctuations, the “forces” acting to oppose topology-
change are, themselves opposed, by quantum “forces” acting to catalyze
topology-change. These two opposing “forces” must seek a stable “equi-

change, are completely dominant when a = 1
situation.

M(1) =

2 0 0

.



(11)

In this case, topological constraints are maximal—topology-change in neutrino-
neutrino transitions is completely prevented (a = 1, b = 0, c = 1
2). That is,
quantum ﬂuctuations, which would otherwise catalyze topology-change, are
eﬀectively overwhelmed by topological energy (or other topological) “barri-
ers” when a = 1. Figure 2.2 illustrates the situation.

7

Now, because of (8, 10 and 11), any matrix M(a) deﬁned on the interval

( 1
3 ≤ a ≤ 1) can be written as a function of the single parameter a as

where

M(a) =

(14)

Presumably, this particular three-to-one “mixture” of M( 1
3 ) and M(1), re-
spectively, represents the equilibrium condition between opposing topology-
changing and topology-maintaining “forces”, respectively.

3.0 A Simple Calculation of a, b and c.

According to (3) and (8) the matrix elements a, b and c are given by

a = a

b = 1

c = 1

2 (1 − a)
4 (1 + a)




.

(15)

Focus attention on the pair of matrix elements a and b, which bracket c. Now,
topology-changing “forces” (quantum ﬂuctuations) constantly “attempt” to
maximize b at the expense of a (and c), while at the same time, topology-
maintaining “forces” (energy barriers ?) constantly “attempt” to maximize
a (and c) at the expense of b (See Figures 2.1 and 2.2).

Since a and b are both functions of a, a “compromise” between these op-
posing “forces” should be reached when the product f (a) = ab is maximized
[11] with respect to variations of a. From (15) one has

f (a) =

1
2

a(1 − a),

8

(16)

which possesses a maximum at a value of a equal to the harmonic mean [12]
of the boundary values a 1

and a1 (See Fig. 2.2), namely,

3

a0 =

2a 1

a 1

3

3 · a1
+ a1

=

1
2

.

(17)

And, this value of a is precisely the value required to yield the Georgi-Glashow
matrix M( 1

2 ) of (9). However, one other conceivable solution for a0 exists.

The function g(a) = abc also possesses a maximum, which occurs at a
and a1

value of a equal to the geometric mean of the boundary values a 1
(See Fig. 2), namely,

3

a0 = qa 1

3 · a1 =

√3
3

= 0.577.

(18)

Equations (17) and (18) represent the only physically acceptable solutions
involving extremal functions that depend on simple products of the matrix
elements a, b and c (i.e., ab, bc, ac and abc).

For example, while the function h(a) = b · c possesses a maximum, this
occurs at a value of a equal to zero, which point lies outside the physically
acceptable region (a 1
3 ≤ a ≤ a1). And, the function i(a) = a · c possesses a
minimum instead of a maximum. Moreover, this occurs at an “unphysical”
value of a, namely, a0 = − 1
2 .
In summary, without further constraints, (17) and (18) would seem to be
equally likely solutions. Is there some way to decide which solution nature
should choose?

3.1 Discussion

Three reasons can be cited in favor of (17) and M( 1

2 ). These are

1. From the standpoint of simplicity and parsimony the quadratic f (a) =
ab is obviously simpler and more parsimonious than the cubic g(a) =
a· b· c. For example, the quadratic is symmetrical about its maximum,
while the cubic is asymmetrical about its maximum. The function f (a)
is also simpler and more parsimonious than g(a), in the sense that g(a)
has two factors a and c that describe the eﬀect of topology-maintaining
“forces”, while f (a) has only one such factor a. Hence, for reasons of
simplicity and parsimony, (17) and M( 1
2 ) are favored over (18) and
M(0.577), respectively.

9

2. From [9] the matrix M( 1

2 ) is known to be consistent with a reasonable
form for the neutrino mass-matrix and associated mixing-parameters.
The choice of (18) and M(0.577) would require changes in these quan-
tities that may, or may not, be consistent with the presently known
experimental properties of neutrinos. Hence, (17) and M( 1
2 ) appear to
be favored for this reason over (18) and M(0.577), respectively.

3. In Appendix A we present a crude “derivation” of the matrix M based
on a harmonic-oscillator description of the balance between topological
and quantum “forces.” This description also seems to favor (17) and
M( 1

2 ) over (18) and M(0.577), respectively.

It is remarkable that, in the absence of an in-depth understanding of
topology-maintaining and topology-changing “forces” (See Fig. 2.2), it has
nevertheless proven possible to obtain an exact calculation (see qualifying re-
marks above) of the matrix elements a, b and c, which describe long-distance
neutrino mixtures. This apparent success strongly supports the main premise
of this paper, which is that topological constraints play a major role in de-
scribing both short- and long-distance neutrino mixtures.

4.0 Conclusions

Topological constraints appear to play a major role in determining the na-
ture of both short- and long-distance neutrino mixtures. Given that the νe
and (νµ or ντ ) neutrinos have distinct topologies, and assuming that topol-
ogy changes are suppressed in neutrino-neutrino transitions, while neutrino-
neutrino transitions without topology-change are relatively enhanced–one
easily determines both the form of the matrix describing long-distance neu-
trino mixtures, and even ﬁxes the numerical magnitudes of the individual ma-
trix elements. If the predicted matrix (9), or one close to it [i.e., M(0.577)],
is eventually conﬁrmed by observations of neutrinos from distant astronom-
ical sources, this will strongly support the new description of fundamental
fermions, which requires, among other things, that the νe and (νµ or ντ )
neutrinos start life as topologically-distinct quantum objects [3–5].

ing M (a0).

(a 1

Imagine that the parameter a describes a dynamical “system” associated with
neutrino-neutrino mixtures. In particular, this system has a single degree of
freedom (is constrained to move on a straight line), which is further bounded
by a1 and a 1
3 ≤ a ≤ a1). Treating a as a kind of “generalized coordinate”
we are led to consider the “generalized forces” acting on the “system” and to
determine its equilibrium “position” a0 (See Fig. 2.2). Quantum ﬂuctuations,
in eﬀect, “force” the “system,” as described by a from the value a = a1
. At the same time, topological energy (or other topological)
toward a = a 1
“barriers” eﬀectively “force” the system as described by a, from the value a =
a 1
toward a = a1. These two opposing “forces” must reach a compromise,
i.e., stable equilibrium, at some value a (call it a0), which lies somewhere
and a1. This value (a0) we take to describe long-distance neutrino
between a 1
mixtures via the matrix M(a0).

calculated. To do this, note ﬁrst that ∂V (x)/∂x must be a number with
the “units” of a (assuming k is dimensionless). And, since the only number
available to describe the system on the boundary of a, is a itself, we make
the following assumptions

Analogous examples of ﬂuctuation-induced topology-change in macroscopic
objects (e.g., destruction of topological objects due to thermal ﬂuctuations at
phase transitions) abounds. For example, otherwise persistent (“conserved”)
topological defects in crystals can be destroyed by raising the temperature
suﬃciently (i.e., by melting the crystal). Similarly, otherwise persistent
(“conserved”) magnetic ﬂux-tubes in Type II superconductors and/or vor-
tices in a superﬂuid, can both be destroyed by raising the temperature above
the critical temperature Tc. And, conversely, topological defects are always
created when such macroscopic systems ﬁrst condense (or crystallize) as the
temperature is lowered. We imagine that something roughly similar can hap-
pen when quantum-ﬂuctuations (vacuum ﬂuctuations) act on otherwise very
similar quantum states (i.e., same charge, spin and nearly identical mass)
that also happen to start life as distinct topological-objects. That is, we
are assuming that, if not prevented by some conservation law, transitions
between such states (e.g., νe and νµ neutrinos) will be catalyzed by quantum
ﬂuctuations.

In spite of the
many successes of the standard model of particle physics, the observed prolif-
eration of matter-ﬁelds, in the form of “replicated” generations or families, is
a major unsolved problem. In this book a new organizing principle for funda-
mental fermions is proposed, i.e., a minimalistic “extension” of the standard
model based, in part, on the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for matrices. To in-
troduce (internal) global degrees of freedom that are capable of distinguishing
all observed ﬂavors, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is used to generalize the
familiar standard-model concept of scalar fermion-numbers f (i.e., fm = +1
for all fermions and fa = −1 for all antifermions). This theorem states that
every (square) matrix satisﬁes its characteristic equation. Hence, if fm and fa
are taken to be the eigenvalues of some real matrix F (a “generalized fermion

13

number”), it follows from this theorem that both f and F are square-roots
of unity. Assuming further that the components of both F and its eigen-
vectors are global charge-like quantum observables, and that F “acts” on
a (real) vector 2-space, both the form of F and the 2-space metric are de-
termined. One ﬁnds that the 2-space has a non-Euclidean or “Lorentzian”
metric, and that various associated 2-scalars serve as global ﬂavor-deﬁning
“charges,” which can be identiﬁed with charges such as strangeness, charm,
baryon and lepton numbers etc.. Hence, these global charges can be used to
describe individual ﬂavors (i.e., ﬂavor eigenstates), ﬂavor doublets and fami-
lies. Moreover, because of the aforementioned non-Euclidean constraints and
certain standard-model constraints, one ﬁnds that these global charges are
eﬀectively- “quantized” in such a way that families are replicated. Finally,
because these same constraints dictate that there are only a limited num-
ber of values these charges can assume, one ﬁnds that families, and their
associated neutrinos, always come in “threes.”

[4] The eigenvectors Q of F (i.e., FQ = f Q where f is the scalar fermion-
number), together with certain pairs of linearly independent vectors (U and
V) that resolve Q (i.e., Q = U + V), namely, various non-Euclidean vec-
tor “triads” (Q, U, V)—these are the analogs of Euclidean triangles—serve
to represent ﬂavor-doublets in terms of a pair of quark or lepton ﬂavor-
eigenstates as follows:

|“up”i = |q1, u1, v1, Q2, U2, 2U · Vi

and

|“down”i = |q2, u2, v2, Q2, U2, 2U · Vi.

Here, Q = {q1, q2}, U = {u1, u2} and V = {v1, v2} are column-vectors and
their components q1, q2, u1, u2, v1 and v2, together with the non-Euclidean
scalar products Q2, U2 and V2, are various global mutually-commuting
ﬂavor-deﬁning charge-like quantum numbers. When we refer to the “topol-
ogy” of a particular neutrino ﬂavor-eigenstate (e.g., the νe) we are referring
to the topology of the corresponding vector triad (Q, U, V), with respect to
the internal transformation F. And, because F generates the M¨obius group
Z2 (i.e., F2 = I2), those vector “triads” that are left unchanged by F, have
the topology of a cylinder, whereas vector triads that are changed by F (but
obviously not changed by F2 = I2), have the topology of a M¨obius strip.
And, as it turns out, the neutrino ﬂavor νe (νµ or ντ ) corresponds to a vector
triad having the topology of a cylinder (M¨obius strip) with respect to F.

Am. Inst. of Physics, New York, 1993, pp. 128–129. An inexact, but neverthe-
less very suggestive, analogy can be drawn between our 2D (non-Euclidean)
charge-vectors Q = {q1, q2}, and the 2D (Euclidean) topological-“charge”
vector called a Burgers vector. The quantized Burgers vector of a dislocation
or defect in a 2D crystal lattice, is deﬁned as the net number of extra rows
and columns one encounters while traversing a closed path around the defect,
expressed as a vector {columns, rows}. In general, defects are discontinuities
or “tears” in some order-parameter ﬁeld. In this particular case, the defect
is a topological line-singularity in the crystalline order. Because the topolog-
ical “charge” (Burgers vector) is conserved as the associated defect migrates
through the crystal lattice, the associated defect is also conserved within the
lattice. Similarly, our quantized charge-vector Q is conserved (∆Q = 0), as
the associated fundamental-fermion (quark or lepton) moves through space-
time. Conservation of the vector Q leads to the identiﬁcation of Q2 with the
“conserved” baryon- or lepton-number. Hence, we can think of the vector Q
as being a topological “charge”, which describes certain aspects of a topo-
logical “defect” (fundamental fermion) in some spacetime order-parameter
ﬁeld. The geometric object we call a vector triad, namely (Q, U, V where
Q = U + V), while not generally conserved (owing to quantum transitions
such as U1 + V1 ⇀↽ U2 + V2 = Q), nevertheless, provides a further de-
scription of such spacetime “defects”. Finally, the topology of fundamental
fermions is said to be the same as that of the associated vector-triad under
the internal transformation F.

In the case of strongly-interacting quarks, topological constraints of the kind
considered here can, at most, play a minor role in determining such things
as KM-type matrix elements. For example, it is well known that the angle
θc, V12 and the d, s quark masses md and ms, respectively, are related via
ms , where ms > md 6= 0, even though the d and s quarks

V12 = sin θc = q md

are characterized, like the νe and (νµ or ντ ) neutrinos, respectively, by dis-
tinct topologies. Somehow, the underlying topology plays a major role in
mixing, in the case of the weakly-interacting neutrinos, but not in the case
of the strongly-interacting quarks. The small value, and near degeneracy,
of neutrino masses is probably a major factor in explaining such diﬀerences
between quarks and neutrinos.

[11] Ordinarily one thinks of a maximization process as describing a condition
of unstable equilibrium. However, in the present situation, two diﬀerent kinds
of “forces” (topological and quantum) are in opposition. Taken together,
these “forces” are constantly attempting to maintain the product f (a) = a· b
at its maximum value. That is, the “system” described by f (a) should be in
a state of stable equilibrium.

[13] In Section 3.0, the matrix elements a, b and c were calculated without an
in-depth understanding of the underlying dynamics. The present description,
based on a simple harmonic-oscillator “potential” V (x), represents a very
crude ﬁrst-attempt to remedy this situation. However, strictly speaking, to
reach equilibrium at a = a0, it would also be necessary to include “damping”
of some sort. This has not been done.

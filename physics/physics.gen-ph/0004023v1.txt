Abstract

The paper provides an extended local gauge transformation. By means of it, the Lagrangian of
gauge ﬁelds with masses can keep unchanged in the continuous transformations.
In this way, the
Higgs mechanism becomes unnecessary and we do not need to suppose the existence of the Higgs
particles.

PACS numbers: 1110, 1130

According to the Yang-Mills theory, in order to keep the Lagrangian of a system unchanged under
the local gauge transformation, the transformation rules of the ﬁeld φ and its covariant diﬀerentiation
should be deﬁned as

φ(x) → φ′(x) = exp[iθi(x)Ti]φ(x)

Dµ(x)φ(x) → D′

µ(x)φ′(x) = exp[−iθi(x)T i]Dµ(x)φ(x)

in which

Dµ(x) = ∂µ + Aµ(x)
µ(x)T i

Aµ(x) = −igAi

From Eq.(2), we can get the transformation rule of gauge under the inﬁnitesimal transformation

µ(x) → A′i

µ(x) = Ai

The intensity of the gauge ﬁeld is deﬁned as

It can not keep unchanged under the transformation.

However, the gauge particles just as W ± and Z 0 have masses. In order to solve this problem, in
the current theory, the Higgs mechanism has to be introduced. By means of the concept of spontaneous
symmetry breaking of vacuum, the gauge particles obtain their masses. The current gauge theory has
achieved great success but has also two basic faults. The ﬁrst is that the Higgs particles can not be found
up to now. The second is that the theory can not keep unchanged again after the Higgs mechanism is
introduced, that is to say, the invariance is not thorough. Besides, there exist some other problems, for
example, too many parameters have to be introduced and the reason of spontaneous symmetry breaking
of vacuum is also unclear and so on.

It is proved below that we can solve these problems by introducing a supplement function Bi

µ(x). Let

Bµ(x) = Bi

µ(x)T i, similar to Eq.(2), we deﬁne the extended transformation as

Dµ(x)φ(x) → D′′

µ(x)φ′(x) = exp[−iφi(x)T i][Dµ(x) + Bµ(x)]φ(x)

(8)

Here D′′µ(x) = ∂µ + A′′i
transformation rule of Ai

µ(x) becomes

µ (x). It can be calculated from Eq.(8) that by the extended transformation, the

In this way, the Lagrangian is invariable under the extended gauge transformation. It is obvious that the
invariance of continuous transformations can also be kept in this way.

Now let us discuss how to determine the forms of the functions Bi

µ(x) from Eq.(19). Suppose i =
µ(x) is 4N . But they only satisfy one equation, that is to say, only one of them

1.2 . . . N , the number of Bi
is independent. The other 4N-1 Bi

µ(x) can be chosen arbitrarily. As the simplest form, if we take

Bi

µ(x) = B1

1 (x) = B(x)

Bi

µ(x) = 0

Eq.(19) can be written as

µ = 1

µ 6= 1

In the formulas, the functions Ai
µ(x) can be determined by the motion equations of gauge ﬁelds. But the
forms of θi(x) are arbitrary. So the form of B(x) can be determined by Eq.(21) if the forms of θi(x) are
given. However, B(x) does not appear in the Lagrangian. It is only a useful tool to help us to reach the
gauge invariance.

The situation with interaction is discussed below. Taking the united theory of electric-weak interaction
between spinor ﬁelds and gauge ﬁelds as an example, we have two kinds of spinor ﬁelds called the left-hand
ﬁeld and right-hand ﬁeld with diﬀerent transformation rules in this case

in Eq.(22).In the formula above, ψL and ψR are determined by their motion equations. Besides, if the
ghost particle and ﬁxed gauge term are also considered, the corresponding factors have to be added into
the formulas, but we do not discuss them any more here.

After the extended gauge transformation is introduced, the mass items of gauge particles can be added
into the Lagrangian directly. Because the Lagrangian can still keep unchanged in the extended gauge
transformation, the Becchi-Rouet-Stora invariability and the Ward-Takahashi equationare also tenable in
this case. So the theory is still renormalizable. We can do it similar to what we have done in the current
theory. In this way, the Higgs mechanism becomes unnecessary. Therefore, according to the paper, we
do not need to suppose the existence of the Higgs particles.

Abstract

We make comments on Kim and Chan’s [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 115302 (2006)] letter. Based on

their pressure-dependent measurements (by a torsional oscillator technique), we propose that the

supersolid fraction (ρs/ρ) might be relevant to an sound absorption or attenuation (ﬂuctuations of

pressure waves) in microscopic domain since there is no apparent change in Tc with pressure.

Quite recently Kim and Chan have measured the pressure dependence of the supersolid

fraction by a torsional oscillator technique. Superﬂow is found from 25.6 bar up to 136.9 bar

[1]. Kim and Chan used oscillation speed (vmax : maximum oscillation speed of the annulus)

of 5µm/s or less to study the supersolid [2-10] response of 9 additional solid samples at 25.6,

41.8, 48.7, 56.9, 60.1, 70.6, 87.1, 99.0, and 104.0 bar (they found the NCRIF (nonclassical

rotational inertia (NCRI) fraction) is independent of vmax, provided vmax does not exceed 10

µm/s. Once exceeded, NCRIF decreases with vmax. They thus interpreted this as a critical

velocity eﬀect [3]. NCRIF measured with vmax smaller than 10 µm/s, being independent

of oscillation speed, represents the supersolid fraction, ρs/ρ). The uncertainty in pressure

determination is less than 0.5 bar. The low temperature supersolid fractions, ρso/ρ, of all

fourteen samples are plotted in Fig. 4 of [1] as a function of pressure. The non-monotonic

dependence of the supersolid fraction on pressure indicates that, as commented in [1], the

origin of supersolidity is more subtle than just the simple Bose condensation of zero point

vacancies. The fact that Kim and Chan found a supersolid fraction of up to 1.5% is also

diﬃcult to reconcile with the simple vacancy condensation model. A number of experiments

[11] give indirect evidence that zero point vacancies, if present below 0.2K, would be much

smaller than 1% of the lattice sites.

We know that solid helium at an elevated pressure is expected to be less quantum mechan-

ical than that at a lower pressure [12]. X-ray diﬀraction studies measuring the zero-point
energy induced motions of the 4He atoms from their lattice sites appear to conﬁrm this

expectation [13]. The declining supersolid fraction with pressure beyond 55 bar is also con-

sistent with this expectation. However, Kim and Chan do not understand why there is no

apparent change in Tc with pressure. This could be one evidence that there are pressure

oscillations (ﬂuctuations of waves although being rather small) during the imposing process

of high pressures in [1].

The present author also noticed that broad (dissipation) maxima centering near where

NCRIF is changing most rapidly were found in [1] (cf. Fig. 2 therein). These broad

maxima in dissipation are more pronounced in low pressure solid samples and in data taken

at low vmax. The dissipation maximum fades with increasing pressure and it is barely dis-

cernible in samples with pressure exceeding 108 bar. This behavior, as the present author

compared it with those in [14], looks like an acoustic absorption or attenuation (ﬂuctuations

of high-frequency pressure waves) in a rareﬁed environment. Meanwhile, Rittner and Reppy

just reported supersolid decoupling in a solid sample made by the same blocked capillary

method [10]. However, upon annealing the sample by cooling it much more slowly from

about 1.5K than when it was ﬁrst grown, the supersolid decoupling was found to diminish

and even disappear [10]. This is another evidence that there might be pressure (or tempera-

ture) oscillations (high-frequency ﬂuctuations of waves) during the imposing process of high

pressures.

Note that Kim and Chan have also looked for this annealing eﬀect by cooling a number

of solid samples from the liquid-solid coexistence region down to the lowest temperature

at a cooling rate that is up to 5 times slower than that of Rittner and Reppy [10]. Kim

and Chan, however, found the supersolid fraction due to diﬀerent annealing procedure can

diﬀer by at most 15%. But, they have not been able to eliminate the superﬂow in any of

the more than 50 bulk solid samples they have studied so far in our laboratory. This fact

could be explained as the almost adiabatic process (smooth or long-period annealing) is

equivalent to a rather-low-frequency forcing (ﬂuctuations of waves) such that the small ex-

citations being damped out and the frequency range is already beyond the triggering regime

of phase transition [14]. The latter (annealing eﬀect) could also be traced in [15] or partly

related to that reported in [8]. Acknowledgements. The author is partially supported by the

Wheeler-Feynman Absorber Theory Viewed by Model

of Expansive Nondecelerative Universe

Abstract. The present contribution documents the harmony of postu-
lates and conclusions of Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory and the model
of Expansive Nondecelerative Universe. A relationship connecting advanced
electromagnetic waves and gravitational ﬁeld quanta is rationalized.

Advanced and retarded waves in absorber theory

The absorber theory was developed by Wheeler and Feynman in the forties [1]
and elaborated by many others [2]. One of the features of modern physics is a
renaissance of the above theory, its postulates, predictions, and consequences.
The theory was aimed at the rationalization of radiation resistance.

During its accelerated motion a charged particle – a source of radiation -
emits electromagnetic waves. These waves, known as classic retarded waves,
are absorbed by another charged particle – absorber - that, in turn, pro-
duces both retarded and advanced waves, the latter being characterized by
negative energy. Advanced waves move backward in time to the emitter
(instantaneous eﬀect) and may act as a bearer of information.

Evaluating the problem in more detail from the viewpoint of mathemat-
ics, diﬀerential equation describing the propagation of an emitted wave is
second order in both space and time and provides thus two independent
time solutions and two independent space solutions. It follows from a time-
symmetrical solution of Maxwell equations [2]

∇ × E± = −

dt

(1)

that as to the vector of electric ﬁeld intensity E+, negative energy is at-
tributed to the advanced waves, and as to the vector E−, positive energy
relates to the retarded waves. Denoting the electric ﬁeld vector E (or the

1

magnetic ﬁeld vector B) of the wave as F , then the retarded and advanced
waves can be deﬁned by the following equations [2]

Fret = −i.F0. exp [i(k.r − ω.t)]

Fadv = i.F0. exp [i(−k.r + ω.t)]

(3)

where k is the propagation vector, r is the distance from the source of ra-
diation, ̟ is the frequency of the wave, and t is the time. It follows from
(2) and (3) that the retarded wave represents the positive-energy solution
and reaches a point at the distance r after the instant of radiation emission.
Contrary, the advanced wave is the negative-energy (and negative frequency)
solution and comes to a point at the distance r before the instant of radiation
emission.

Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory can be understood as an alternative
to the classic probability interpretation of the Copenhagen school. It can con-
tribute to explanation of several known paradoxes, such as that of Schr¨odinger
cat, quantum mechanical Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen locality premise, experi-
ment with two slits, etc. [3, 4].

Gravitation in Expansive Nondecelerative Universe

In the Expansive Nondecelerative Universe (ENU) model [5-7], negative val-
ues are attributed to the quanta of gravitational ﬁeld, i.e. such quanta might
represent a good candidate for advanced waves. Gravitational output Pg of
a body with the mass mis deﬁned in the ENU as follows

Pg = −

where a is the gauge factor of the Universe (its present calculated value is
1.3 × 1026 m) and R is the scalar curvature (contrary to a more frequently
used Schwarzschild metric in which R = 0, in Vaidya metric applied in the
ENU, R 6= 0 also outside a body).

In order to preserve the consistency of our postulates, it must hold

where α is the ﬁne structure constant and Pe is the electromagnetic (radia-
tive) output of an accelerated charged particle. It follows from (4), (5), and
(6) that

Gravitational quanta and advanced waves

Postulating that the emitter must interact with more than one charged par-
ticles, the mass m in (4) represents a total mass of all charged particles
interacting with the emitter during its accelerated orbital motion.
In (5)
and (7), r is the mean distance of the emitter from the above mass of ab-
sorbers and, at the same time, it represents a mean radius of the emitter orbit
curvature at its motion. Further, a Schr¨odinger-type relation must hold

A target of the present contribution does not lie in evaluation of the correct-
ness of Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory. Based on the validity of a logic
assumption (6), it is rather aimed at oﬀering gravitational ﬁeld quanta as a
suitable candidate of advanced waves.

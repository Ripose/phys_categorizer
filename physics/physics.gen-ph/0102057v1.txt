Abstract

We have investigated the implications of Quantum Mechanics to macroscopic scale. Evaporation of
Black Holes and evolution of pulsars may be one of the consequences of this conjecture. The two
equations GM = Rc2 and GM 2 = ¯hc where R and M are the radius and the mass of the universe,
are governing the evolution of the universe throughout its entire cosmic expansion, provided that the
appropriate Planck constant is chosen. The existence of very large values of physical quantities are
found to be due to cosmic quantization.

1. INTRODUCTION

The general theory of relativity (GTR), which attributes the structure of space-time to the
gravitating mass, is incompatible with the theory of quantum mechanics (QM). While quantum
mechanics is a linear theory the GTR is highly nonlinear so that the two theories are dissim-
ilar. Attempts to linearize the GTR do no give all manifestation of the theory. Initially the
intention of the development of GTR was to describe the large scale structure of the universe,
i.e., solar and galactic scales, whereas QM deals with the microscopic scales. The uniﬁcation of
electromagnetic, weak and strong was successful and gave a lot of hints to further uniﬁcation
with the hitherto unachievable gravitational interaction. Particle physicists are ambitious to get
the uniﬁcation of all interactions at an energy scale of 1019GeV!

However, these disparate worlds can meet in some cases. In these situations, phenomena in
atomic physics appear to be written in the language of gravity and Einstein’s GTR. By knowing

the working of one subject, we can thus make educated guesses about the other.
One therefore should not look for a paradigm in which gravity is manifested as a force, but
we should treat gravity as a background (framework) on which other interactions occur. Thus
gravity provides only the shape of the space-time membrane on which other interactions are
carried. We therefore, expect that gravitational eﬀects are always present and manifested in the
way space-time aﬀects our physical phenomena. We remark that one should treat gravity not as
an independent interaction but rather as a framework in which all interactions take place and
consider only the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions to be independent. We therefore
expect to observe quantum eﬀects at microscopic as well as macroscopic scale depending on
the dimension of the system under consideration. This would imply that quantum eﬀect at
cosmic scale to be similar to those at microscopic scale, they only diﬀer in the magnitude of
the quantization. This is plausible since the masses and distances are enormous for macroscopic
system.
After making these arrangement we would end up with a cosmic Planck constant having a huge
value for macroscopic scales. The relative errors in determining the physical properties of the
macroscopic system would have the same value as for microscopic one. One would also expect
that the same laws governing the microscopic scale to be still functioning but with scaled ones.
This might require some physical quantities to evolve in order to satisfy these laws.

Based on Tiftt’s [1] experimental data on galactic red-shift DerSarkissian [2] suggested a

cosmic quantum mechanics (CQM) characterized by the Planck constant [3]

hg = 10102h = 1068 J.s

where h is the ordinary Planck constant of the quantum mechanics. The quantum state of a
galaxy is described by a wave function ψ(x, t) so that galaxies become the elementary particles
of CQM. For a gravitational system and according to Einstein equivalence principle a body with
observable inertial mass (mi) has observable active mass (ma) and hence an observable gravita-
tional ﬁeld. The observability of the this ﬁeld requires that the total energy (self-gravitational
energy) stored in it is measurable and, therefore, greater than h/2t (according to the uncertainty
principle ∆E∆t > h/2 and ∆t
E). For a spherical body of mass M and radius R we
have

In QM a body is observable only if its self-gravitational energy EG is greater than h/2t(EG >
h/2t). All bodies in QM obey this inequality. By supposing that the CQM obey the same rules
as QM except that the corresponding Planck constant is diﬀerent we can write,

which is obeyed by all cosmic bodies. For galaxies this formula gives

This implies that, for t = 1017sec, R = 1019m, and

where A = 2 for bosons, A = 3 for fermions. Thus CQM applies well to galaxies. Is there other
CQM that applies at planetary, solar or universal scale with diﬀerent quantum of action (hc)?
Caldirola et al [6] suggested in a framework of uniﬁed theory of strong and gravitational

interaction that a quantum of action for the universe is given by

where M, R are the mass and the radius of the universe. Equation (9) gives

with M = 1053 kg and R = 1026 m [6].
A possible connection between h and hc for the universe exists where h

due to torsion ﬁeld [7]. Massa [3] enlarged the above relation to become

where Rg is a typical radius of a galaxy (Rg ∼
that “these forms are special case of a more general form still unknown”. In fact, the CQM for
planetary scale is introduced by Pierucci [8] in which

which explains the Titius-Bode law and other regularities of the solar system. Massa considered
the possibility of the growth of hc with cosmic time (t). He, according to the Large Number
t5/2, and he concluded that the
hypothesis (LNH) [9], suggested that for a ﬂat universe hc ∼
CQM is incompatible with this LNH. Carneiro [10] investigated the extension of scale invariance
to quantum behavior. The price that paid was the scaling of Planck constant (h) leading to

quantization of large structure that treated till now as classical systems. He used the LNH in
his theory and concluded that the angular momentum for a rotating universe is of the order of
magnitude of 1087J.s.

So far there is yet no evidence that the universe is rotating but if it does it should do that
with this value! However, Kuhne [11] claimed an observation of a rotation of the universe. We
remark that an order of magnitude for the universe angular momentum is within the limit for the
global rotation obtained from the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) anisotropy
obtained by Kogut et al [12]. Carneiro [10] suggested that “one of the possible explanation of
the large scale quantization could be based on an evolutional point of view: the quantum nature
of the universe during its initial times has molded its-apparently quantized nowadays large scale
structure”.
We also note that Nottale obtained, on a diﬀerent ground, a scale Planck constant of order
1042J.s for a QM model for the solar system [13].
Carneiro [10] applied the Bohr quantization condition to the motion of Earth around the Sun
and found that this is consistent provided that Planck constant has the value 1042J.s. Muradian
[14] found an angular momentum of stars around 1042J.s which is close to Kerr limit of a rotating
black hole with a mass of 1030kg.
In this work we try to explain the origin of large numbers occurring in nature by appealing to this
conjecture. The hierarchical nature of mass, cosmological constant, entropy, temperature and
angular momentum are found to be one of the manifestation of this conjecture. The evolution
and characteristics of astrophysical objects like, black holes and binary pulsars are investigated
in the framework of this conjecture.

We present our model in sect.2 and discuss its implication in a framework in which G and
Λ vary with cosmic time in sec.3. In sect.4 we apply our conjecture to Black Holes and Binary
Pulsars. In sec.4 we constrain the maximal acceleration and force appearing in the universe,
according to our model. We wind up our paper with a conclusion.

2. THE MODEL

The usual deﬁnition of Planck mass (mP ) can be inverted to give

In a similar fashion, we suggest a cosmic Planck constant (hc) with a cosmic Planck mass MP
as

Another possibility, from a dimensional point of view, is

Therefore, all three forms reduce to the ordinary Planck constant in the early universe (radi-

This value is diﬀerent from the Planck constant for the planetary system quoted in eq.(12). Thus

through a simple formula. It is found that the universe satisﬁes the equation

This is an statement of the equality of the rest mass energy of the universe to its gravitational
energy (i.e., Mc2 = GM 2

of its mass the black hole will have one unit of entropy, i.e., S = kB. Black holes forming during
solar and galactic time will have entropy that is multiple of ¯hc. We thus conclude that the
entropy of black holes is quantized. A galactic mass black hole will have an entropy of 10102kB,
while a solar mass black hole will have an entropy of 1076kB. However, a black hole of the mass
of the universe has an entropy of 10120kB. We observe that in the early universe we have

Thus one may connect the smallness of the present value of the cosmological constant to the

where TP = 1032K. We remark that De Sabbata and Sivaram obtained a similar value by
considering a time-temperature uncertainty relation (∆t∆T = ¯h/kB) and relate the maximum
time to Hubble time. They suggested that they could obtain such a value by considering a
black hole of a mass of the universe using the formula outlined in eq.(27). Or by considering
the maximal possible entropy of 10120kB which would imply this minimal temperature. They
also found a similar value and noted that this minimal temperature corresponds to the quantum
ﬂuctuations of cosmological torsion background.
Massa [21] has obtain a similar value and relates this to the mass of graviton. He argued that
in an expanding universe this mass depends on time. Rosati [22] found the quantum ﬁeld today
66g. Larionov [23] attributed a similar mass term to an
has typically a mass of the order of 10−
eﬀective mass associated with the vacuum energy density (or Λ). He assigned this extremely
low value of this eﬀective mass to a quantum with wavelength equal to the present radius of
the universe. One may also add to this conjecture the cosmological constant problem (rooted
in the enormous value, i.e., ΛP = 10120Λ0) as due to the cosmic quantization, as is evident from
eq.(18)!
According to Massa assertion the graviton has a mass; this would mean that the range of the

8

gravitational interaction is not inﬁnite but limited by this mass scale. Hence, the maximum
possible interaction distance between any two gravitating objects has to be at a maximum
distance of 1026m. A similar assertion would also hold for electromagnetic interaction if it
turned out that a photon is not massless!
We have so far shown that the two formulae (eqs.(14) and (21))

GM = c2R and GM2 = ¯hcc

hold throughout the cosmic evolution of the universe, provided we consider the CQM to be a
valid principle.

The Planck energy density is deﬁned as

ρP =

c5
G2¯h

which represents the maximum density of the universe at Planck time. We now employ the
CQM and evaluate the present maximum energy density of the universe, i.e.,

4. MAXIMAL ACCELERATION AND FORCE

The self-gravitational force of a system of mass M and radius R is given by

Using eq.(41)

for the universe. This force is clearly independent of the mass of the object into consideration. It
is thus a universal force, and since it depends on G inversely it deﬁnes a maximal self-gravitational
force. There corresponds to this maximal force a maximal acceleration (Fmax. = Mamax.) deﬁned
by

If we consider a variable gravitational constant as suggested in [16], one gets a minimal gravita-
tional force in the universe during the nuclear (or hadronic) epoch as

since during nuclear (or hadronic) epoch the gravitational constant was GN = 1040G0. This
smallness of this force may account for the fact that quarks are asymptotically free inside hadrons,

5. CONCLUSION

We have extended the implication of quantum mechanics form microscopic scale to include
macroscopic scale. This extension resulted in a lot of interesting consequences concerning the
evolution and characteristics of black holes and binary pulsars. We have found that quantities
like entropy, cosmological constant and time are quantized for macroscopic scales. Limiting val-
ues for temperature, entropy, angular momentum (¯hc), force, acceleration are obtained due to
this conjecture. The universe is found to have an energy density less that Planckian density at
the present time. We have also shown that we have diﬀerent Planckian parameters for the uni-
verse for diﬀerent time. The relation GM 2 = ¯hc which was found to apply in the early universe
is still valid during other phases, provided that we replace the ordinary Planck constant with
the cosmic Planck constant, whose value depends on the properties of the macroscopic entity.

On the Quantum Aspects of the Logarithmic

Corrections to the Black Hole Entropy

Carlos Castro ∗ and Alex Granik†

Abstract

An extension of the conventional space-time to noncommutative
Cliﬀord manifolds where all p-branes are treated on equal footing al-
lowed authors to write a master action functional. The respective
functional equation is simpliﬁed and applied to the p-loop oscillator
on Cliﬀord manifolds. Its solution represents a generalization of the
conventional quantum point oscillator which also extends to the region
of the Planck scales. In the latter the solution yields in an elemen-
tary fashion the basic relations of string theory including string tension
quantization. In addition, it is shown that the degeneracy of the f irst
collective excited state of the p-loop oscillator yields not only the well-
known Bekenstein-Hawking area-entropy linear relation but also the
logarithmic corrections therein.

The p-Loop Harmonic Oscillator in Clif-
ford Manifolds

A new relativity theory [4]-[11] introduced an extension of the ordinary space-
time by considering non-commutative C-spaces where all p-branes are uniﬁed
on the basis of Cliﬀord multivectors. This resulted in a full poly-dimensional
covariance of the quantum mechanical loop wave equations derived from a
master action functional motivated by earlier work [1],[2].

where Σ is an invariant evolution parameter (a generalization of the proper

is a Cliﬀord algebra-valued line ”living” on the Cliﬀord manifold outside
space-time, Λ is the Planck scale that allows to combine objects of diﬀer-
ent dimensionality in Eqs.(2,3) and the multivector X Eq.(3) incorporates
both a point history given by the ordinary ( vector) coordinates xµ and the
holographic projections of the nested family of all p-loop histories onto the
embedding coordinate spacetime hyperplanes ,that is σµν, ....σµ1µ2...µp+1. The
scalar ( from the point of view of ordinary Lorentz transformations but not
from the C-space point of view ) Ωp+1 is the invariant proper p + 1 = D-
volume associated with a motion of a maximum dimension p-loop across the
p + 1 = D-dim target spacetime. The vector X has 2D components. In what
follows we concentrate our attention on a truncated version of the theory by
applying it to a linear p-loop oscillator.
The truncated version follows from 3 simpliﬁcations. First, in (1) the cubic
( corresponding to vertices) and the quartic (braided scattering) terms are
dropped. Secondly, all the holographic modes are frozen and only the zero
modes are kept. This would yield conventional diﬀerential equations instead
of functional ones. Thirdly, we assume that the metric in C-space is ﬂat.
We proceed along by properly deﬁning what we mean by ”relativistic” based
on the new relativity. The complete theory is the master ﬁeld theory whose
action functional admits a noncommutative braided quantum Cliﬀord al-
gebra. As a result of the postulated simpliﬁcations, we are performing a
reduction of such a ﬁeld theory to an ordinary quantum mechanical the-
ory. It must be kept in mind that ﬁelds are not quantized wave functions.

2

For this reason the wave equations that we will be working with refer to a
nonrelativistic theory in C-spaces.
Employing the above simplifying assumptions, we obtain from the action (1)
the following wave equation describing a p-loop linear oscillator in C-space

Gµνρτ is some suitably symmetrized product of the two ordinary metric-
tensors gµνgρτ .
It should be noted that in general this is not the case. In C-space a metric
is a collection of components

G = {Gµν; Gµνρτ , ...}

this set of generalized higher rank tensors is similar to the ones found in
W-geometry [13] [22] that bear a resemblance to the maximal acceleration
of the Finsler type ( jet bundles ) geometries [3] as discussed by C. Hull.
For references see [13] . The Einsteinian gravity is an eﬀective ﬁeld theory
representing a long range limit of a more fundamental Finslerian , W geom-
etry. The latter ﬁts nicely into the framework of the extended relativity in
C-spaces due to the fact that the Planck scale is the lowest limiting scale.
In Eq.4 T is tension of the spacetime-ﬁlling p-brane, D = p + 1, mp+1 is the
parameter of dimension (mass)p+1 , the parameter L (to be deﬁned later)
has dimension (length)p+1 and we use units ¯h = 1, c = 1.
We rewrite Eq.(4) in the dimensionless form as follows

where T =
is the dimensionless tension which is related (due to the
linearization procedure) to the “ mass-parameter-like ” quantity E appearing
in the action functional (1) by E 2 = mp+1T + (m2
p+1Vharmonic/L2). The
latter term is the harmonic potential for the p-loop oscillator. A is a scaling
parameter that will be determined below.

CD
Inserting the usual Gaussian solution for the ground state into the wave
equation (4) we get the value of A :

A ≡ mp+1L2/Λp+1

Without any loss of generality we can set A = 1 by absorbing it into L.
This will give the following geometric mean relation between the parameters
L, mp+1, and Λ

L2 = Λp+1/mp+1 ⇒ Λp+1 < L <

mp+1

meaning that there are three scaling regimes. The scale represented by gen-
eralized Compton wavelength (1/mp+1)(1/p+1) will signal a transition from a
smooth continuum to a f ractal ( but continuous ) geometry. The scale L
will signal both a discrete and f ractal world, like El Naschie’s Cantorian-
fractal spacetime models [14] and p-adic quantum mechanics [21] and Λ the
quantum gravitational regime.
The dimensionless coordinates then become

˜xµ = qΛp+1mp+1 xµ/Λ, ˜σµν = qΛp+1mp+1 σµν/Λ2, ...,
˜Ωp+1 = qΛp+1mp+1 Ωp+1/Λp+1

The dimensionless combination Λp+1mp+1 (which indicates existence of two
p+1 ) obeys the following double inequality:
separate scales , Λ and (1/mp+1)

qmp+1Λp+1 < 1 < s

mp+1Λp+1

(6)

In turn, relations (6) deﬁne two asymptotic regions:
1)the ”discrete-fractal” region characterized by mp+1Λp+1 ∼ 1, or the Planck
scale regime, and
2)the ”fractal/smooth phase transition ”, or the low energy region charac-
terized by mp+1Λp+1 << 1.

Since the wave equation (5) is diagonal in its arguments (that is separable)
we represent its solution as a product of separate functions of each of the
dimensionless arguments ˜xµ, ˜σµν, etc.

Ψ = Yi

Fi(˜xi) Yj<k

Fjk(˜σjk)...

(7)

Inserting (7) into (5) we get for each of these functions the Whittaker equa-
tion:

Z′′ − (2T − ˜y2)Z = 0

(8)

where Z is any function Fi, Fij, ..., ˜y is the respective dimensionless variable
˜xµ,˜σµν, ..., and there are all in all 2D such equations. The bounded solution
of (8) is expressed in terms of the Hermite polynomials Hn(˜y)

Therefore the solution to Eq.(5) is

Z ∼ e−˜y2/2Hn(˜y)

(9)

Ψ ∼ exp[−(˜x2

µ + ˜σ2

µν + ... + ˜Ω2

p+1)]Yi

Hni(˜xi)Yjk

Hnjk (˜σjk)...

(10)

where there are D terms corresponding to n1, n2, ..., nD. There are D(D −
1)/2 terms corresponding to holographic area excitation modes n01, n02, ...,
etc. Thus the total number of terms corresponding to the N-th excited state
(N = nx1 + nx2 + ... + nσ01 + nσ02 + ...) is given by the degree of the Cliﬀord
algebra in D dimensions, that is 2D.
The respective value of the tension of the N-th excited state is

TN = (N +

1
2

2D)mp+1

(11)

yielding quantization of tension.
Expression (11) is the analog of the respective value of the N-th energy state
for a point oscillator. The analogy however is not complete. We point out
one substantial diﬀerence. Since according to a new relativity principle [4],
[5] all the dimensions are treated on equal footing (there are no preferred
dimensions) all the modes of the p-loop oscillator( center of mass xµ, holo-
graphic modes, p + 1 volume) are to be excited collectively. This behavior is
in full compliance with the principle of polydimensional invariance by Pez-
zaglia [20]. As a result, the ﬁrst excited state is not N = 1 ( as could be
naively expected) but rather N = 2D. Therefore

5

T1 → T2D = 3

2(2Dmp+1)

instead of the familiar (3/2)m.
Having obtained the solution to Eq.(5), we consider in more detail the two
limiting cases corresponding to the above deﬁned 1) fractal and 2) smooth
regions. The latter (according to the correspondence principle) should be
described by the expressions for a point oscillator. In particular, this means
that the analog of the zero slope limit in string theory, the ﬁeld theory limit,
is a collapse of the p-loop histories to a point history :

Λ → 0, mp+1 → ∞, T → ∞, σµν, σµνρ, ...... → 0, L → 0. ...

and these limits are taken in such a way that the following combination
reproduces the standard results of a point-particle oscillator :

xµ

˜xµ =

Λ qmp+1Λp+1 → xµ/a

(12)

where the nonzero parameter a > Λ is a ﬁnite quantity and is nothing but
the amplitude of the usual point-particle oscillator.
In string theory, there are two scales, the Planck scale Λ and the string scale
ls > Λ. Without loss of generality we can assign a ∼ ls. A large value of
a >> Λ would correspond to a “macroscopic” string. We shall return to this
point when we address the black-hole entropy. For further details we refer
to [12]
To consider the black hole entropy we ﬁnd the degeneracy associated with
the N-th excited level of the p-loop oscillator. The degeneracy dg(N) is equal
to the number of partitions of the number N into a set of 2D numbers

N = {nx1 + nx2 + ... + nxD + nσµν + nσµνρ + ... + nΩp+1}.

This means that there is a collective center of mass excitations, holographic
area excitations , holographic volume excitations,....etc. And the latter are
given by the set of quantum numbers nxD ; nσµν , ..., nΩp+1 respectively. These
collective extended excitations are the true quanta of a background indepen-
dent quantum gravity. Thus spacetime becomes a “ process “ in the making
[2] emerging from the C-space.
The degeneracy dg(N) is

dg(N) =

Γ(2D + N)

Γ(N + 1)Γ(2D)

6

(13)

where Γ is the gamma function.
Based on these results it is tempting to propose that the exact analytical
expression for the entropy associated with the f irst collective excitation of
the p-loop oscillator is given by the logarithm of the degeneracy :

S = ln {

Γ(2D + N)
Γ(N + 1)Γ(2D)}. N = 2D

(14)

where 2D is the degree of Cliﬀord algebra. In [12] in order to make contact
with the entropy of a black hole in d dimensions, and its relation to the
logarithm of the degeneracy of the highly exited states of a string living in
d dimensions, we imposed the following relation between N = 2D and the
black hole (d − 2) dimensional horizon area

N = 2D =

Ad−2
cdGd

. Gd = Λd−2

where cd is in general a dimension-dependent coeﬃcient. For example, in
d = 4; cd = 4. In essence, this coeﬃcient indicates that a surface area of a
two-dim sphere is 4 times the area of the holographic disk. In turn, the bits
are counted in terms of holographic area, or disk units. The Newton constant
in d dimensions is given by Λd−2 in units ¯h = c = 1. For black holes, the
area A is the area transverse to the radial and temporal directions, i.e. it is
a (d − 2)-dimensional area which precisely matches the power of the Planck
scale entering the deﬁnition of the Newton constant in d dimensions. The
number N, the degree of the Cliﬀord algebra in D dimensions, associated
with the p-loop oscillator living in D dimensions, is nothing but the number
of (d− 2)-dimensional horizon area bits of the black hole. Both the area and
the tension quantization follow quite naturally from this theory!
If we consider large values of N and 2D then using Stirling formula in (14)
we get the following expression for the entropy:

S = 2Nln 2 −

1
2

ln N −

ln 2 − ln √2π − O(1/N).

1

(15)

In a particular case of d = 4 one has then N = A/4G = A/4Λ2, and we
will recover not only the logarithmic corrections recently reviewed in the
literature [18] but also all the higher order corrections to the Bekenstein-
Hawking entropy in d = 4 dimensions, up to numerical coeﬃcients:

S = 2

2

ln[

A
4Λ2 ] −

ln2 − ln√2π − (

(16)

7

As could be expected, Einstein’s gravity ( an eﬀective theory) is recovered in
the long range limit, i.e. for N >> 1, eq.(16) yields a linear dependence be-
tween S and A. At smaller scales a departure from this behavior is observed,
since at Planck scales the new (extended) scale relativistic eﬀects (and as-
sociated with it Cantorian-fractal spacetime, braided Hopf quantum Cliﬀord
algebras, p-adic quantum mechanics, irrational conformal ﬁeld theory, non-
commutative geometry, etc.) begin to take over leading to deviations from a
linear dependence S = S(A).
From the entropy-area expression (16) we ﬁnd that if entropy cannot de-
crease, the entropy of a black hole of an area A3 (expressed in terms of N3
bits) must be not less than the sum of the entropies of two black holes of
areas A1 ( expressed in terms of N1 bits ) and A2 (expressed in terms of N2
bits ) whose ”fusion” forms a black hole of area A3:

(2ln2)(N3 − N2 − N1) +

1
2

ln

N1N2
N3 ≥ 0.

The respective necessary condition looks like a relation between N3, a squared
mean geometric, and a double arithmetic values of N1 and N2:

(17)
If one would deﬁne the exponential of the entropy as the number = N of
micro-physical states then we get:

N1N2 ≥ N3 ≥ N1 + N2.

N = eS = e2N ln2− 1

2 lnN−... ∼ 22N N−1/2 =

22D+1
2D/2

(18)

Notice the double exponents ( a “googolplexus“ ) appearing in the number
of micro-physical states .
For a k-th excited level of the p-loop oscillator we obtain the following ex-
pression:

(19)

Nk = kN1 = k2D =

kAd−2
cdGd

=

kAd−2
cdΛd−2 .

This number may correspond to the entropy of a bound state of many black
holes.
In [12] we equated the degeneracy dg(N, D) of the ﬁrst collective excited
of a p-loop oscillator (14) in D dimensions with the asymptotic quantum
degeneracy of a massive (super) string state dg(n) in d dimensions where
n >> 1 is the very large string’s spectral level number. Li and Yoneya [16]

8

have shown explicitly that the logarithm of the asymptotic ( large spectral
level n limit ) quantum degeneracy of the massive string states coincided
precisely with the Bekentsein-Hawking Black Hole Entropy SBH ∼ A/G.
For example, in this fashion we were able to show by ﬁxing d = 26 (bosonic
string dimension ) that indeed :

SBH ∼

Gd ∼ ln [dg(n)] ∼ √n ∼ N = 2D
Ad−2

(17)

This equality between dg(d, n) = dg(N, D) was justiﬁed by the following
physical reasoning. It is possible to introduce diﬀerent frames in a new rel-
ativity: one frame where an observer sees only the strings in d-dimensions
(with a given degeneracy) and another frame where the same observer sees a
collective excitations of points, strings, membranes,..., p-loops in D-dimensions
etc. The observed degeneracy (given by a number) should be invariant in
any frame. The string’s spectrum Regge behaviour also follows naturally in
this theory [12].
This represented a rather amazing result: the Shannon entropy of a p-loop
oscillator in D-dimensional space ( for a suﬃciently large D), that is the
number N = 2D, the total number of bits representing all the holographic
coordinates, the degree of the Cliﬀord Algebra in D dimensions, is propor-
tional to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole in d
dimensions. The latter is just the number of d − 2 dimensional area bits in
Planck units.
For a detailed derivation of (17) we refer a reader to [12]. A more rigor-
ous study of the connection between Shannon’s information entropy and the
quantum-statistical (thermodynamical) entropy is given by Fujikawa [15].
Because light is trapped inside, the Black Hole horizon is also an information
horizon.

2 Conclusion

Application of a simpliﬁed linearized equation derived from the master action
functional of a new ( extended) relativity to a p-loop oscillator has allowed
us to elementary obtain rather interesting results. First of all, the solution
explicitly indicates existence of 2 extreme regions characterized by the values
of the dimensionless combination mp+1Λp+1 :

9

1) the fractal region where mp+1Λp+1 ∼ 1 and 2 scales collapse to one, namely
Planck scale Λ
and
2) the smooth region where mp+1Λp+1 << 1 and we recover the description
of the conventional point oscillator.
Here 2 scales are present , a characteristic ”length” a that we identiﬁed with
the string scale ls and the ubiquitous Planck scale Λ ( a > Λ) thus demon-
strating explicitly the implied validity of the quantum mechanical solution
in the region where a/Λ > 1. For a speciﬁc case of p = 1 (a string) the
solution yields ( once again in an elementary fashion) a quantization of the
sting tension T and one of the basic relations of string theory T = 1/α′.
A comparison of the degeneracy of the f irst collective state of the p-loop
oscillator, living in a very large number of dimensions D, with the highly
excited level number n of the degeneracy of the massive ( super) string theory,
given by Li and Yoneya [16], demonstrated that the Shannon entropy ( which
is in agreement with the logarithm of the degeneracy of states ) of a p-loop
oscillator in D-dimensional space , that is the number N = 2D : the number
of bits representing all the holographic coordinates , is proportional to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole in d dimensions.
In the linear regime of entropy versus area, the latter is just the number of
(d − 2) dimensional area bits in Planck units.
Moreover, the solution allowed us to ﬁnd ( up to numerical coeﬃcients ) the
logarithmic, and higher order corrections to the entropy-area linear law (
in full agreement with [18]) by retaining the ﬁrst order terms in Stirling’s
formula. It is also suggestive to propose that the exact analytical expression
for the black hole entropy is associated with the f irst collective excitation
of the p-loop oscillator and is given by Eq.(14)

S = Ln{

Γ(2D + N)
Γ(N + 1)Γ(2D)}, N = 2D =

Ad−2
cdGd

, Gd = Λd−2

where cd is a dimension-dependent coeﬃcient which for d = 4 is c4 = 4
Thus a study of a simpliﬁed model ( or ”toy”) problem of a linearized p-loop
oscillator gives us ( with the help of elementary calculations) not only a set
of the well-known relations of string theory but also the logarithmic correc-
tion to the well-known black hole entropy-area relation ( obtained earlier on
the basis of a much more complicated mathematical technique). This indi-
cates that the approach advocated by a new relativity might be very fruitful,

10

especially if it will be possible to obtain analogous analytic results on the ba-
sis of the full master action functional and the resulting functional nonlinear
equations whose study will involve Braided Hopf Quantum Cliﬀord Algebras.

The motive of this paper is to seek a mechanism of gravitational phenomena. It is shown that the
forces between sources or sinks immersed in ideal ﬂuids are coincide with the inverse-square-law of
gravitation. Based on the hypothesis that the space is ﬁlled with a kind of ideal ﬂuid which may be
called aether, tao or apeiron and introducing the concept of monad, a sink ﬂow model of particles
is set up. Thus, the inverse-square-law of gravitation is derived by methods of hydrodynamics.
Further, the equations of gravitational ﬁeld of continuously distributed particles and the equivalence
of inertial mass and gravitational mass are also derived. As a byproduct, it is shown that there
exists a universal damping force exerted on each particle.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The main purpose of this paper is to derive Newtonian
law of gravitation by means of ﬂuid mechanics based on
sink ﬂow model of particles.

The motive of this paper is to seek a mechanism of
gravitational phenomena. The reasons why new models
of gravity are interesting may be summarized as follows.
Firstly, there exists some astronomical phenomena
that could not be interpreted by the present theories of
gravitation, for instance, the Titius-Bode law [1]. New
theories of gravity may view these problems from new
angles.

Secondly, whether the gravitational constant G de-
pends on time and space is still unknown [2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8] . It is known that the gravitational constant G
is a constant in Newton’s theory of gravitation and in
theory of general relativity(GRT).

Thirdly, the mechanism of the action-at-a-distance
gravitation remains an unsolved problem in physics for
more than 300 years [9, 10, 11]. Although GRT is a
ﬁeld theory of gravity[12], the concept of ﬁeld is diﬀer-
ent from that of continuum mechanics[13, 14] because of
the absence of a continuum in GRT. Thus, GRT can be
regarded as only a phenomenological theory of gravity.

Fourthly, we do not have a satisfactory quantum the-
ory of gravity presently [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . One of the
most important challenges in theoretical physics is to rec-
oncile quantum theory and GRT[15, 20]. New theories
of gravity may open new ways to solve this long lasting
problem.

Fifthly, one of the greatest puzzles in physics is the
problem of dark matter and dark energy[21]. New theo-
ries of gravity may provide new methods to attack this
problem[22, 23].

Finally, we do not have a successful uniﬁed ﬁeld theory
presently. Great progress has been made towards an uni-
ﬁcation of the four fundamental interactions in the uni-

∗Electronic address: wangxs@lnm.imech.ac.cn

verse in the 20th century. However, gravitation is still not
uniﬁed successfully. Einstein’s GRT is the most promi-
nent theory of gravitation. Einstein believed that all the
fundamental interactions in the universe are rooted in
gravity. Therefore, he started with a non-Euclidian ge-
ometry of space-time following his GRT. But he and oth-
ers did not succeeded in this direction [24]. New theories
of gravity may shed some light on this great puzzle.

To conclude, it seems that new considerations on grav-
itation is needed. It is worthy keeping an open mind with
respect to all the theories of gravitaty before the above
problems been solved.

Now let us brieﬂy review the long history of mechan-
ical interpretations of gravitational phenomena. Many
philosophers and scientists, such as Laozi[25], Thales,
Anaximenes, believed that everything in the universe is
made of a kind of fundamental substance[9]. Descartes
was the ﬁrst to bring the aether concept into sci-
ence by suggesting that it has mechanical properties[9].
Descartes interpreted the celestial motions of celestial
bodies based on the hypothesis that the universe is ﬁlled
by an ﬂuidic vortex aether.
Since Newton’s law of
gravitation was published in 1687[26], this action-at-a-
distance theory was criticized by the French Cartesian[9].
Newton admitted that his law did not touch on the mech-
anism of gravitation[27]. He tried to obtain a derivation
of his law based on Descartes’ scientiﬁc research program.
At last, he proved that Descartes’ vortex aether hypothe-
sis could not explain celestial motions properly[26]. New-
ton himself even suggested an explanation of gravity
based on the action of an aetherial medium pervading
the space[27, 28]. Euler attempted to explain gravitaty
based on some hypotheses of a ﬂuidic aether[9].

In a remarkable paper published in 1905, Einstein
abandoned the concept of aether[29]. However, Einstein’s
assertion did not cease the exploration of aether[9, 30,
31, 32, 33, 34]. Einstein changed his attitude later and
introduced his new concept of ether[35, 36].

Inspired by the above mentioned philosophers and sci-
entists, we show that Newton’s law of gravitation is de-
rived based on the hypothesis that all the particles are
made of singularities of a kind of ideal ﬂuid.

II. FORCES ACTING ON SOURCES AND
SINKS IN IDEAL FLUIDS

The purpose of this section is to calculate the forces
between sources and sinks in inviscid incompressible ﬂu-
ids which is called ideal ﬂuids usually. It is known that
the equation of mass conservation of an ideal ﬂuid be-
comes Laplace’s equation ∇2φ = 0, where φ is veloc-
ity potential[37, 38, 39, 40]. The velocity ﬁeld u of
the ﬂuid is determined by u = ∇φ. Using spherical
coordinates(r, θ, ϕ), a general form of solution [40] of
equation ∇2φ = 0 which can be obtained by sepatation
of variables is

φ(r, θ) =

Pl(cos θ),

(1)

∞

(cid:18)

Xl=0

Alrl +

where Al and Bl are arbitrary constants, Pl(x) are Leg-
endre’s function of the ﬁrst kind which is deﬁned as

Pl(x) =

1
2ll!

dl
dxl (x2 − 1)l.

If there exists a velocity ﬁeld which is continuous and
ﬁnite at all points of the space, with the exception of
individual isolated points, then these isolated points are
called singularities usually.

Deﬁnition 1 Suppose there exists a singularity at point
P0 = (x0, y0, z0). If the velocity ﬁeld of the singularity at
point P = (x, y, z) is

(2)

(3)

u(x, y, z, t) =

Q
4πr2 ˆr,

p

(x − x0)2 + (y − y0)2 + (z − z0)2, ˆr denotes
where r =
the unit vector directed outward along the line from the
singularity to the point P = (x, y, z), then we call this
singularity a source if Q > 0 or a sink if Q < 0. Q is
called the strength of the source or sink.

From Eq.1, it is easy to see that the velocity potential
φ(r, θ) of a source or sink is a solution of Laplace’s equa-
tion ∇2φ = 0. The strength of the source or sink evalu-
ates the volume of the ﬂuid leaving or entering a control
surface per unit time. Since a sink can be regarded as a
negative source, we may use the term source to represent
a source or a sink for convenience.

Theorem 2 Suppose (1)there exists an ideal ﬂuid (2)the
ideal ﬂuid is irrotational and barotropic, (3)the density ρ
∂x = ∂ρ
is homogeneous, that is ∂ρ
∂t = 0 (4)there
are no external body forces exerted on the ﬂuid, (5)the
ﬂuid is unbounded and the velocity of the ﬂuid at the
inﬁnity is approaching to zero. Suppose a source or sink
is stationary and is immersed in the ideal ﬂuid. Then,
there is a force

∂y = ∂ρ

∂z = ∂ρ

FQ = −ρQu0

(4)

exerted on the source by the ﬂuid, where ρ is the density
of the ﬂuid, Q is the strength of the source or the sink,
u0 is the velocity of the ﬂuid at the location of the source
induced by all means other than the source itself.

Proof. Only the proof of the case of a source is needed.
Let us select the coordinates that is attached to the static
ﬂuid at the inﬁnity.

We set the origin of the coordinates at the location of
the source. We surround the the source by an arbitrary
small spherical surface S. The surface S is centered at
the origin of the coordinates with radius r. The outward
unit normal to the surface S is denoted by n. Let τ (t)
denotes the mass system of ﬂuid enclosed in the volume
between the surface S and the source at time t. Let FQ
denotes the hydrodynamic force exerted on the source
by the mass system τ , then a reaction of this force must
act on the the ﬂuid enclosed in the mass system τ . Let
FS denotes the hydrodynamic force exerted on the mass
system τ due to the pressure distribution on the surface
S, K denotes momentum of the mass system τ . As an
application of Newton’s second law of motion to the mass
system τ ,we have

DK
Dt

= −FQ + FS,

(5)

where D
Dt represents the material derivative in the la-
grangian system. The expressions of the momentum K
and the force FS is

K =

FS =

(6)

where the ﬁrst integral is volume integral, the second
integral is surface integral, n denotes the unit vector di-
rected outward along the line from the origin of the co-
ordinates to the ﬁeld point(x, y, z).

Let us ﬁrst consider the case that the velocity ﬁeld is

steady, that is ∂φ

∂t = 0.

According to Reynolds’ transport theorem, we have

ρudτ =

(cid:13) ρu(u · n)dS, (7)
ZZS

where V is the volume ﬁxed in space which coincide with
the mass system τ (t) at time t, that is V = τ (t).

As the ﬂow is steady, that is Du

Dt = 0 , the ﬁrst integral

in Eq.(7) vanishes.

According to Bernoulli-Lagrange integral, we have

p +

ρ(u · u)

(8)

where B, which is named Bernoulli constant, is constant
everywhere at any time. Using Eq.(8) and Eq.(6), we
have

FS =

ρ(u · u)ndS.

(10)

Now let us calculate this velocity u in order to obtain
FQ. Since the velocity ﬁeld induced by the source Q is
Eq.(3), then according to the superposition principle of
velocity ﬁeld of ideal ﬂuids, the velocity on the surface S
is

Applying Eq.(16) at the inﬁnity and using Eq.(18), we
have | u |→ 0, ∂φ
∂t → 0 and p = p∞, where p∞ is a
constant. Thus, f (t) = p∞

p = p∞ − ρ

where n denotes the unit vector directed outward along
the line from the origin of the coordinates to the ﬁeld
point(x, y, z). Using Eq.(10) and Eq.(11), we have

Since the radius r can be arbitrarily small, the velocity

Thus, Eq.(12) turns out to be

FQ = −ρ

Since again u0 can be treated as constant, Eq.(13) turns
out to be Eq.(4).

Next, we turn to the case that the velocity ﬁeld u is
unsteady. Using the relation u = ∇φ and Ostrogradsky-
Gauss theorem, we have

ρudV =

(16)

where f (t) is an arbitrary function of time t. Since the
velocity u of the ﬂuid at the inﬁnity is approaching to
zero, then, using Eq.(1), φ(t) must be of the following
form

φ(r, θ, t) =

(21)

This result is the same as Eq.(10) in the steady case.
Therefore, Eq.(4) arrived again. This completes the
proof. (cid:3)

Remark. Faber [39] and Currie [40]obtained the same
result of Theorem 2 for some special cases when the ve-
locity ﬁeld is steady.

Theorem 2 only considers the situation that the sources
or sinks are at rest. Now let us consider the case that
the sources or sinks are moving in the ﬂuid.

Theorem 3 Suppose the presuppositions (1),(2),(3),(4)
and (5)in Theorem 2 are valid and a source or a sink
is moving in the ﬂuid with a velocity vs, then there is a
force

FQ = −ρQ(uf − vs)

(22)

is exerted on the source by the ﬂuid, where ρ is the density
of the ﬂuid, Q is the strength of the source or the sink,
uf is the velocity of the ﬂuid at the location of the source
induced by all means other than the source itself.

Proof. The the velocity of the ﬂuid at the location of
the source relative to the source is uf − vs. Let us se-
lect the coordinates that is attached to the source and
set the origin of the coordinates at the location of the
source. Then Eq.(22) can be arrived following the same
procedures in the proof of Theorem 2. (cid:3)

Applying Theorem 3 to the situation that a source or
sink is exposed to the velocity ﬁeld of another source or
sink, we have

Corollary 4 Suppose the presuppositions (1),(2),(3),(4)
and (5) in Theorem 2 are valid and a source or a sink
with strength Q2 is exposed to the velocity ﬁeld of another
source or sink with strength Q1, then the force F12 exerted
on the singularity with strength Q2 by the velocity ﬁeld
of the singularity with strength Q1 is

F12 = −ρQ2 (cid:18)

Q1
4πr2 ˆr12 − v2(cid:19)

(23)

where Bl(t), l ≥ 0 are functions of time t. Thus, we have
the following estimations

where ˆr12 denotes the unit vector directed outward along
the line from the singularity with strength Q1 to the sin-
gularity with strength Q2, r is the distance between the
two singularities, v2 is the velocity of the source with
strength Q2.

III. DERIVATION OF INVERSE-SQUARE-LAW
OF GRAVITATION

Since quantum theory shows that vacuum is not empty
and has physical eﬀects, e.g., the Casimir eﬀect[34, 41,
42, 43], it is valuable to probe vacuum by introducing the
following

Hypothesis 5 Suppose the universe is ﬁlled by an ideal
ﬂuid named apeiron; the ideal ﬂuid fulﬁll the conditions
(2),(3),(4),(5) in Theorem 2.

This ﬂuid may be named apeiron after Anaximander of
Miletus in order to distinguish with Cartesian aether.
Following Einstein, Infeld and Hoﬀmann, who introduced
the idea that particles may be looked as singularities in
ﬁelds[44, 45], and noticing Eq.(23), it is nature to intro-
duce the following

Hypothesis 6 All the microscopic particles were made
up of a kind of elementary sinks of apeiron. These el-
ementary sinks were created simultaneously.The initial
masses and the strengthes of the elementary sinks are
the same.

Let us name this elementary sink as monad.

Evidently, according to Hypothesis 6, the mass of a
monad is increasing since q0 evaluates the volume of the
apeiron ﬂuid entering the monad per unit time. Thus,
we have

m0(t) = m0(0) + ρq0t,

= ρq0,

m(t) = N m0(t),

= −ρQ,

dm0
dt
dm

(24)






where m0(t) is the mass of monad at time t, −q0 is the
strength of a monad, m(t) is the mass of a particle at
time t, Q is the strength of the particle, N is the number
of monads that make up the particle, Q = −N q0, ρ is
the density of the apeiron, t > 0. For convenience we call
mass instead of inertial mass. Based on Hypothesis 5 and
Hypothesis 6, the motion of a particle is determined by

Theorem 7 The equation of motion of a particle is
m dv
dt = 2ρQv − ρQu + F, where m is the mass of the
particle, Q is the strength of the particle, v is the veloc-
ity of the particle, u is the velocity of the apeiron at the
location of the particle induced by all means other than
the particle itself, F denotes other forces.

Proof. Applying Newton’s second law and Theorem 3 to
this particle, we have d(mv)
dt = −ρQ(u-v) + F. Noticing
the fact d(mv)
dt + v dm
dt and using Eq.(24), we have
m dv

dt = m dv
dt − ρQv = −ρQ(u-v) + F. (cid:3)
Therefore, based on Hypothesis 6, applying Corollary
4 and Theorem 7 to a system consists of two particles,
we have

(25)

Corollary 8 Suppose there is a system consists of two
particles and there are no other forces exerted on the par-
ticles, then the equations of motion of this system are

apeiron.

Eq.(25) shows that there exists an universal damping
force fd = − 2ρq0
m0 mivi, i = 1, 2 exerted on each particle.
Appllying Corollary 8 and ignoring the damping forces
in Eq.(25), we have

Corollary 9 Suppose (1)vi ≪ ui, i = 1, 2, where vi is
the velocity of the particle with mass mi, ui is the velocity
of the apeiron at the location of the particle with mass mi
induced by the other particle, (2)there are no other forces
exerted on the particles, then the force F12 exerted on
the particle with mass m2 by the velocity ﬁeld of apeiron
induced by the particle with mass m1 is

outward along the line from the particle with mass m1 to
the particle with mass m2, r is the distance between the
two particles.

Corollary 9 is coincide with Newton’s law of gravitation
except for two diﬀerences. The ﬁrst diﬀerence is that
mi, i = 1, 2 are constants in Newton’s theory while in
Corollary 9 they are functions of time t. The second
diﬀerence is that G is a constant in Newton’s theory while
in this theory G is a function of time t.

Let us now introduce a hypothesis that G and the
masses of particles are changing so slowly relative to the
time scaler of human beings that they can be treated as
constants approximately. Thus, Newton’s law of gravi-
tation may be considered as a corollary of Corollary 9
based on the above mentioned hypotheses.

IV. SUPERPOSITION PRINCIPLE OF
GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

Since the deﬁnition of gravitational ﬁeld G of a particle
with mass m is G = F
mtest , where mtest is the mass of
a test point mass, F is the gravitational force exerted
on the test point mass by the gravitational ﬁeld of the
particle with mass m, from Theorem 7 and Corollary 9
we have

G =

ρq0
m0

u

(26)

where ρ is the density of the apeiron, m0 is the mass of
a monad, q0 is the strength of a monad, u is the veloc-
ity of the apeiron at the location of the test point mass
induced by the particle with mass m. Thus, the super-
position principle of gravitational ﬁeld is nothing but the
superposition theorem of the velocity ﬁeld of ideal ﬂuids.

−q0 is the strength of a monad, m0(t) is the mass of a

The deﬁnition of the volume density of continuously

distributed sink is

ρs = lim

△V →0

△Q
△V

(27)

where △V is a small volume, △Q is the sum of strengthes
of all the sinks in the volume △V . From the deﬁni-
tion of divergence of vector ﬁeld, we have ∇ · u = ρs.
Thus, we have ∇ · G = ρq0
m0 ρs. Let ρm denotes the vol-
ume mass density of continuously distributed particles,
then according to Hypothesis 6 and Eq.(27), we have
ρm = − m0
q0 ρs. Thus, noticing that the velocity ﬁeld u
of apeiron is irrotational and G = ρq2
0
, the equations
4πm2
0
of gravitational ﬁeld of continuously distributed particles
can be summarized as

∇ × G = 0
∇ · G = −4πGρm

(cid:26)

(28)

There are two basic features of this theory of gravita-
tion. The ﬁrst feature of this theory is that the grav-
itational interaction is transmitted by a kind of ﬂuidic
medium. Thus, the superposition principle of gravita-
tional ﬁeld is nothing but the superposition theorem of
the velocity ﬁeld of ideal ﬂuids. The second feature is
the time dependence of gravitational constant and grav-
itational mass. Newton’s law of gravitation is arrived if
we introduce a hypothesis that G and the masses of par-
ticles are changing so slowly that they can be treated as
constants. Further, the equations of gravitational ﬁeld
of continuously distributed particles and the equivalence
of inertial mass and gravitational mass are derived. As
a byproduct, it is shown that there exists a universal
damping force exerted on each particle.

VI. THE EQUIVALENCE OF INERTIAL MASS
AND GRAVITATIONAL MASS

IX. DISCUSSION

According to Hypothesis 6 and Corollary 9, we have
minertial = mgravitational, where minertial is the inertial
mass of a particle, mgravitational is the inertial mass of
the particle.

There exists some interesting theoretical and applied
problems in the ﬁelds of ﬂuid mechanics, astronomy, as-
trophysics and other related ﬁelds involving this theory
of gravitation.

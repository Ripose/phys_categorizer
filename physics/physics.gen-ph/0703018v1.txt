Abstract

The Pioneer anomaly is explained very simply if we assume that some-
where between us and the aircraft, the scale factor has undergone a dis-
crete jump from an expansion regime a(t) to a contraction regime 1/a(t).

1 Introduction

The so called Pioneer anomaly arised as an anomalous drift in time of the
radiowave frequency received from both Pioneer 10 and 11 as compared to ref-
erence clocks on earth [1]. The anomalous drift was found constant over more
than 10 years and from 40 to 60 AU

including in the error all systematical source of uncertainties. Since all pos-
sible systematical origins investigated by Anderson and collaborators [1] were
excluded or found very unlikely to account for the Pioneer anomaly, there is
increasing evidence that it is now of fundamental physics origin. Many papers
have convincingly argued that the answer cannot be found in General Relativ-
ity where background eﬀects in the vicinity of a local source as is our sun, are
completely negligible [2]. It was also easily checked that even assuming that ex-
pansion takes place in the solar system in the same way as it does in empty space
˙f
f = v/c.H0 where v stands
far from any matter source, we would at most get
for the aircraft speed relative to the earth, which is still negligible as compared
to the Pioneer eﬀect and has the wrong sign. More recent studies on the outer
planet trajectories in the solar system exclude all attempts so far to explain the
eﬀect by a universal modiﬁcation of the gravitational force or the gravitational
inﬂuence of any unknown source in the outer part of the solar system where the
anomaly was most signiﬁcantly detected [3] [4] . This also seems to rule out the
most usual interpretation of the anomaly in terms of an anomalous acceleration
directed toward the sun. Instead, various recent attempts seem now to privilege
exotic physical eﬀects either aﬀecting the radio wave propagation or the clocks
drift in time as caused by their supposed interaction with a background ﬁeld.

Motivated by the strange coincidence
at a roughly 15 percent conﬁdence level coming from both the uncertainty in
the directly measured Hubble parameter H0 and in the eﬀect, we privilege a
background origin for the anomaly in the framework of an hypothetical theory
that would treat the background eﬀects diﬀerently than GR does. Moreover we
take serious the fact that the eﬀect after all appears as a drift in time of the
Pioneer clocks relative to our earth reference clocks. This is enough to suggest
that if the anomaly originates from fundamental physics, the new laws must
aﬀect Pioneer and earth clocks diﬀerently. Hence, if it is a background eﬀect,
the background must not be the same on earth and beyond 20 AU where the
anomalies were detected. Following this way of thincking it is straigntforward to
ﬁnd how the two diﬀerent background evolutions must be related in conformal
time units to account for the eﬀect. We can write down the following metrics
on earth and on Pioneer to get the clocks drift in time relative to each other.

fore, their must be a discrete jump from a(t) to 1/a(t) of the background ﬁeld
between us and Pioneer so that the eﬀect could only start to be seen after the
crossing of this frontier by the aircraft. Within the error bars the jump (see the
steep rise up of the eﬀect in [1]) could not have been better evidenced than it
was around 15 AU in 1983 by Pioneer 11 .

There is a theory involving discrete symmetries where this kind of jump
was predicted, this is the Dark Gravity theory presented in much details in
[5] and [6]. The theory involves many such discontinuities in motion in the
universe and at last can also easily account for the Hubble diagram test with
Supernovae. Recently a discontinuity in the speed of the solar wind was detected
by New Horizons and could well represent another signature of a background
discontinuity as explained in [6] .

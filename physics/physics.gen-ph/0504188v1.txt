Abstract

The polytopic deﬁnition introduced recently describing the topology of manifolds
is used to formulate a generating function pertinent to its topological properties. In
particular, a polynomial in terms of one variable and a tori underlying this polynomial
may be deﬁned that generates an individual cohomological count. This includes the
de Rham complex for example, as well as various index theorems by deﬁnition such as
homotopy. The degree of the polynomials depends on the volume used to deﬁne the
region parameterizing the manifolds; its potentially complex form and L-series is not
presented in this work. However, the polynomials and the relevant torii uniformize the
topological properties in various dimensions; in various dimensions this is interesting
in view of known topologies.

Introduction

The classiﬁcation of manifolds has occupied theorists, both physicists and math-
ematicians of many types, for a long time. In general the construction of invariants
such as the dimensions of de Rham complexes or the computation of indices of spectral
operators relevant to homotopy or cobordism groups follows from a variety of tech-
niques. The dimension of the space (or manifold) is important for both the technique
used to compute the invariants and the end result.

Recently a polytopic construnction was introduced so that a set of points in a
lattice consisting of N d entries may be parameterized by a single number z. This
means that all q1-dimensional manifolds embedded in q2-dimensional space may be
labeled by a single number. Each number represents a manifold, and the construction
permits possible uniformizations of the properties of manifolds in diverse dimensions,
for example a quantity is computable via a function P (z). The polytopes were given
in [1]; related work on the L-series is in [2], and on knot invariants and polynomials in
[3]. Compact number expressions describing gauge amplitudes might also be relevant.

The invariants are introduced and deﬁned in the subsequent section, and following

this, the latticed manifolds are deﬁned and numbered.

Invariants

Consider that a manifold in d dimensions embedded in a lattice of Nd points is

labeled by a number from 0 to N. Then by deﬁnition a polynomial of degree N

generates an invariant I for all manifolds placed in the space. Example would be the
individual (p, q) forms in the Dolbeaux cohomology, homotopies, diﬀerential struc-
tures, etc... Associated to the function (1) is a function,

PI(˜z) = X

˜z = X

cizi ,

(1)

(2)

which is a map from the basis of the numbers labeling the manifolds to another set
of numbers. The latter set of numbers is potentially more convenient for the input
into the polynomials in (1).

The space of all the manifolds, each labeled by an integer, generates numbers by

the manipulation,

An explicit construction of the numbers bi via the left inverse show that for integer
PI(zi) the numbers may be rationalized into integers by multiplying them via the
inverse of the matrix in (3).

The same set of numbers generates an L-series after the numbers bi are rational-
ized to integers and placed into correspondence with the primes via counting them in
accordance with the integers i via pi, and with the bi numbers,

ζ(s, C) = Y (cid:16)1 + app−s + p1−2s

(cid:17)

−1

,

and −p + bp = ap. The construction in terms of the L-series means that there is an
elliptic curve deﬁned for the lattice with N points with bp solutions to

y2 = x3 + α1x + α2 mod p .

There is a series of curves for the series of N points (and the dimensionality). De-
pending on the invariant the curves might have special properties.

A separate modular form is deﬁned by

e−PI (z) = X ∆I(w)e−w ,

X

which essentialy counts the distributions of the invariants of the embedded manifolds
parameterized by the polynomial PI(z). The function ∆I(w) counts the number of
z-solutions to w = PI(z).

The direct computation of these invariants requires specifying the ordering of the
points in the lattice deﬁning the embedding space. The exact ordering of the embed-
ding of the lattice points and their relation to the number labeling the manifold may
play an important role in specifying the forms of the polynomials and their associated
modular forms, and tori. In other words, an appropriate choice may simplify both
the L-series and torus in (4) and (5) (and that of the ’pseudo’-modular form in (6)).

It is of interest to ﬁnd the best parameterization of the embedded manifolds,
via the integers z and the mapping ˜z = fI(z) relevant to the index PI(z). This is
useful in various dimensions to both relate the PI quantities to more symmetric tori
(symmetric via their L-series) in (5) and also to eachother in diﬀering dimensions.

The ﬁnite volume speciﬁcation of the invariants PI are expected to have a V → ∞

limit.

Although the exact form of the invariants are not given here, it would certainly
be interesting to ﬁnd their forms and any coeﬃcient structure in the diﬀerent di-
mensions, and at large volume. The L-series formulation could be relevant in the
classiﬁcation of topologies. Also, fractional dimensional manifolds can be character-
ized by continuation of the P (d)
into non-integral dimensions; the continuation could
deﬁne the properties in this case.

I

Polytope construction

In this section the polytopic, or rather simplicial complex, construction of the
manifolds is given. The topology of the manifolds are found essentially by ﬁlling in a
lattice with a set of points. A basic simplicial complex is deﬁned by ’connecting the
dots’ in Rd. In the polytopic construction here, space-ﬁlling ’membranes,’ embedded
in Rd, are used. All embeddable manifolds are accessible via this construction (such
as a Klein manifold in d = 4).

The polytopes (simplicial complexes) considered are constructed via a set of in-
tegers that label the points and faces parameterizing the surface. The integers may
be given a matrix representation that permits a polynomial interpretation, and hence
maps to knot(s) invariant(s).

Take a series of numbers a1a2 . . . an corresponding to the digits of an integer p,
with the base of the individual number being 2n; this number aj could be written in
base 10 by the usual digits. In this way, upon reduction to base 2 the digits of the base
reduced number spans a square with n + 1 entries. Each number aj parameterizes a
column with ones and zeros in it. The lift of the numbers could be taken to base 10
with minor modiﬁcations, by converting the base of p to 10 (with possible remainder
issues if the number does not ’ﬁt’ well).

The individual numbers ai decompose as

i 2m with the components am
am

i being

P

0 or 1. Then map the individual number to a point on the plane,

i = am
~rm

i × mˆe1 + am

i × iˆe2 ,

with the original number mapping to a set of points on the plane via all of the entries
in a1a2 . . . am. In doing this, a collection of points on the plane is spanned by the
original number p, which could be a base 10 number. The breakdown of the number
to a set of points in the plane is represented in ﬁgure 1.

A set of further integers pj = a(j)

n are used to label a stack of coplanar
lattices with the same procedure to ﬁll in the third dimension. The spacial ﬁlling
of the disconnected polhedron is assembled through the stacking of the base reduced
integers.

Colored polytopes are introduced by taking the integers pj into the numbers a(k,m)
with base N as opposed to base 2. The individual entries in the lattice are spanned
by the vector,

i = am,k

i × mˆe1 + am,k

in the summations involved the expansion are absolute value, the entire sum is found
via a summation over the individual numbers p parameterizing the lattice and its
conﬁguration. (A discussion of the computation of the matrices M is found in [1].)

The ’colored’ boundary is given a boundary via the same formalism, but with
a generalized diﬀerence |ai − ai−1|; group theory or ’color’ diﬀerences found with a
diﬀerent inner product are possible. The summations for these numbers may also be
inverted to obtain the values ai in terms of pj and an associated matrix.

An example list of this variables is given in the following table,

The polyhedron is constructed by the single numbers spanning the multiple layers
in 3-d, or by one number with the former grouped as p1p2 . . . pn. The generalization
to multiple dimensions is straightforward. Also, the sewing and disection of the
manifolds based on the operations on the integer p is straightforward.

Conclusions

Manifolds are put in one to one correspondence with the integers via an embed-
ding into a d-dimensional lattice. To each integer z there is a set of latticized points
specifying the manifold.

Properties such as cohomology, and other topological ones, are formulated in a

uniform sense via mappings

The ﬁrst function speciﬁes the index of the manifold z via its value on z. The latter
function is a redeﬁnition of the coordinates labeling the lattice conﬁgurations; these
two functions should enter with eachother for each of the topological indices.

The values of the indices, speciﬁed on all manifolds within a lattice of size N d,

may be put into correspondence with an L-series via,

ζ(s, C) = Y (cid:16)1 + app−s + p1−2s

(cid:17)

(15)

and −p + bp = ap; a simple ordering is for the primes to be put into correspondence
with the z-values and bp = P (z). The function ˜z = f (z) is chosen to systematize the
entries in (15). In this fashion, there is an elliptic curve that speciﬁes the topological
index in d-dimensions for a lattice of size V (and as V → ∞).

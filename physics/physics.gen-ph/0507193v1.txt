Abstract

The Klein-Gordon equation of the hydrogen atom has a low-lying
eigenstate, called hydrino state, with square integrable wavefunction.
The corresponding spinor solution of Dirac’s equation is not square
integrable. For this reason the hydrino state has been rejected in the
early days of quantum mechanics as being unphysical. Maybe it is
time to change opinion.

1 Introduction

A. Sommerfeld [1] was ﬁrst to calculate relativistic corrections to the energy
levels of the hydrogen atom, even before Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger laid the
foundations of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Later the energy levels
were calculated using the relativistic equations of Dirac. The result happened
to coincide in leading order with that of Sommerfeld. These calculations are
repeated in about every textbook on relativistic quantum mechanics — see
e.g. Sakurai [2].

R.L. Mills and collaborators recently [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] discovered the forma-
tion of plasma in a hydrogen gas under rather exceptional conditions. They
explain the observed phenomena by a catalytic conversion of hydrogen atoms
into a state where the electron is strongly bound to the nucleus, with a bind-
ing energy which is much larger than in the conventional groundstate of the
hydrogen atom. They call this new state the hydrino state. A. Rathke [8]
has questioned the existence of such a state, claiming that it is incompatible
with standard quantum mechanics. All Rathke’s arguments relate to non-
relativistic quantum mechanics. The present paper discusses the problem in
the context of relativistic quantum mechanics.

In the next Section the groundstate of the relativistic Klein-Gordon equa-
tion is considered. Section 3 deals with spherically symmetric excited states.
In Section 4 the groundstate is transformed into a spinor solution of the
radial Dirac equation. The ﬁnal section contains a short discussion.

In the latter case the electron is strongly bounded to the proton, almost 104
times stronger than in the conventional ground state of the electron. Such a
state, if it exists, may be called a hydrino state [9, 8]. Note that the radius
of the hydrino state, as found here, is to leading order independent of the
actual value of α.

In textbooks (see e.g. [2]), the solution with l close to 1 is rejected as

being non-physical. This point will be discussed later on.

calculated. For simplicity, only spherically symmetric states are considered.

The latter expression was ﬁrst obtained by A. Sommerfeld [1] and gives the
energy levels of the hydrogen atom, with relativistic corrections to leading
order in α (see e.g. [2], Eq. 3.311). It is clear from this expression that the
binding energy is always small compared to m0c2, except when n = 0 and
γ is small (see Table 1). This one exception is the only state for which the
binding energy is larger than that of the the traditional ground state. It is
also the only one for which the Bohr radius, given by

rn =

is smaller. Hence, the present treatment predicts the existence of a single
hydrino state which is more stable than the conventional groundstate of the
hydrogen atom.

4 Radial Dirac equation

Here, the method of van der Waerden (see [2]) is followed to transform a
solution of the Klein-Gordon equation into a spinor solution of Dirac’s equa-
tion.

(29)

With this choice of functions the pair of ﬁrst order equations (26, 27) is
equivalent with the Klein-Gordon equation (2).

Assume now that f is a solution of the type described in previous sections,
divergent as r−l for small r. Then g can be calculated via (26) and diverges
as r−l−1. Hence it is a square integrable function provided that l < 1/2. This
condition is satisﬁed for all of the usual eigenstates of the hydrogen atom,
but not for the hydrino state for which l is close to 1. This argument shows
that the hydrino ground state has a square integrable wavefunction, which is
solution of the Klein-Gordon equation, but the corresponding spinor, which
solves the Dirac equation, is not square integrable. Note that the radial Dirac
equations (26, 27) are not in their canonical form. By transforming them the
functions f and g are mixed. Both resulting wavefunctions are not square
integrable in case of the hydrino state.

5 Discussion

This paper starts with the Klein-Gordon equation, with minimal coupling to
the non-quantised electromagnetic ﬁeld. In case of a Coulomb potential this
equation is the obvious relativistic generalisation of the Schr¨odinger equation
of the non-relativistic hydrogen atom.
It has two sets of eigenfunctions,
one of which introduces small relativistic corrections to the non-relativistic
solutions. The other set of solutions contains one eigenstate which describes
a highly relativistic particle with a binding energy which is a large fraction
of the rest mass energy. This is the hydrino state.

In Section 4 the method of van der Waerden is followed to transform the
wavefunction of the hydrino to a spinor solution of the Dirac equation. Then
Dirac’s equations reduce to a pair of radial equations (For simplicity, only
spherically symmetric wavefunctions are considered and spin is neglected).
It is then straightforward to verify that some or all of the components of the
spinor solution are not square integrable near the origin of space. This is

6

known since long and has been used as an argument to reject the second set
of eigenstates as being non-physical.

Recent experiments [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] with hydrogen plasmas have been used
as an indication in favour of the existence of a hydrino state in atomic hy-
drogen. In this light it is necessary to reconsider the set of highly relativistic
solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation of the hydrogen atom. A number
Is it an axiom of physics that the spinor
of diﬃcult questions come up.
solutions of Dirac’s equation are square integrable? Or is Dirac’s equation
just a convenient way to handle the Klein-Gordon equation and is the ba-
sic requirement that the solution of the latter equation is square integrable?
Even if Dirac’s equation constitutes the basic theory then it is still not clear
whether non-integrability at the origin is more than a mathematical incon-
venience. Indeed, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom is not a point but its
charge is smeared over a distance of about 10−15 m. The solutions of the
Klein-Gordon equation or of the Dirac equation with smeared-out Coulomb
potential are expected not to diverge at the origin. Hence the problem of
square integrability disappears. The equations cannot be solved analytically
in this case. But there is no reason why the hydrino solution should dis-
appear. The main eﬀect of smearing out the Coulomb potential, besides
regularisation of the wavefunction at the origin, will be a small decrease of
the binding energy.

In a recent paper, Rathke [8] criticised the unconventional theory of Mills
[9] concerning the existence of the hydrino state of the hydrogen atom. The
present paper shows that one can ﬁnd arguments in favour of the hydrino
state also in the standard theory of relativistic quantum mechanics. The
model of the hydrogen atom considered here is not the most sophisticated
one. The spins of electron and of nucleus have been neglected. The electro-
magnetic ﬁeld should be treated in second quantisation. These modiﬁcations
will add a lot of technicality but will probably add only minor corrections to
the present treatment. As long as these more sophisticated calculations are
not accomplished, there are no serious arguments from quantum mechanical
theory to reject the existence of the hydrino state.

ABSTRACT

We introduce two time: deterministic Newton time-stream t and stochastic time-

epoch τ . The relation of uncertainty for time-epoch of physical events

∆τ ∆D

c1,

(

where c1 = const, is proved. The function

D(t) =

characterizes velocity of disorganization of the event-phenomena; fτ (t) is density of
probability of time-epoch τ .

The relation (*) is veriﬁed not by means of experiment that is traditional for

physics, but with the help of the reference to datas of historical science.

M

In the World of events

we select such property as the time order. The time
order contacts with such concept as a stream of time. Events are developed (un-
wrapped) before the observer consistently, in time. It means that for measurement
of time the special measuring tool of the duration of the phenomenon in time and
named a watch is used. With the help of watch to each event the concrete number
named (time) moment of event or his(its) epoch is attributed. The time order allows
to compare epoch of any events.

However the time stream due to which the phenomena consisting of events are
developed (unwrapped) consistently, event behind event, is given to the person as
noted philosopher Kant, a priori, from birth. It is consequence of such fact that the
person has topologically trivial 4-dimensional body [1, 2]. In other words, time as
a stream is only subjective perception (recognition) of the phenomena of the World
of the events inherent to the person.

Therefore it is necessary to assume, that time can show itself in our human world,
the world of human subjective representations about the World of events, absolutely
diﬀerently than the time order. As a matter of fact it means, that time can ﬁnd out
itself as something that can violate time ordering in deployment of events! Hence
events of which the phenomenon consists, can receive epoches with violation of the
time order.

Whether means it, what time can have properties similar to a random vari-
able? Anyway it is necessary to try to apply principles of probability theory to the
description of time.

We shall accept further that the choice of the epoches (moments) of time which
are attributed to events of the phenomenon with the help of some ﬁxed watch can
be casual.

Let’s forget for simplicity about such concept as a place of event. In this case
events in the World of events can be distinguished only with the help of the time order
and formally it means that the World of events
is the linear ordered continuum
like real straight line IR.

M

Let’s assume that we choose watch t which allow each event x to attribute the
moment of time appropriate to him, i.e. epoch τ . We shall accept that each event
gets random epoch. It is understood as the following. So far as event (atomic event
or the elementary phenomenon in the sense of A.D.Alexandrov) is some idealization,
it should occupy only an instant τ in a time-stream t. It is accepted in the theory of a
relativity. But actually it is stretched in a time-stream t and consequently its epoch τ
is absolutely precisely unknown, though must lie on some concrete segment [τ, τ +∆τ ]
of time t. Hence epoch τ of event x is a random variable τ :< X, S, P >
IR, where
X is probability space of events, S is σ-algebra on X, P is a probability measure
on X.

→

Identifying space of events X with the World of events
, and considering that
is real straight line IR, we receive time-epoch τ (t) as a random variable given in

a time-stream t.

Event in probability theory is a measurable subset of space X. In our terminol-
ogy the concept of the phenomenon corresponds to concept of event in probability
theory.
In turn the events which consist of the phenomenon are elements of set
X which in probability theory correspond to elementary events. In terminology of
. But it is obvious that this
Minkowski events are points of the World of events
is simpliﬁcation accepted in this theory.

M

So, we shall accept that property of time which is shown in ”choice” of the
moment of time which corresponds to event is a random variable which we shall
name time-epoch.

Let fτ (t) be a density of distribution of time-epoch τ satisfying two conditions

As it will be shown below this velocity the is more, than temporal borders are
closer for localization of the phenomenon in a stream of time. We can deduce now
some law to which time-epoch satisﬁes.

Theorem is proved.

The relation of uncertainty (5) was postulated in [5, 6, 7] as one of laws of

for descriptions of events of the past. Thus the relation (5) is proved not by means

datas of historical science.

the law of uncertainty of descriptions.

Though without any doubt after formalization of concepts ∆τ, ∆D that it was
not made in [5, 6, 7] it is possible to speak and about experimental check of relation
(5).

Basis for reception of our result was that circumstance that space-time

This duality consists of that on the one hand elements of set

is arithmetic arena on which the World of events is realized.
This arithmetic arena is necessary for formalization of the World of events to
attribute to events the coordinates as the four of real numbers, to world lines of
the four of real functions etc. As a rule the researcher deals with mathematical
space-time which we have named arithmetic arena.

M

However other side of space-time, the World of events, remained in a shadow

and was not formalized! At the beginning of article we have identiﬁed
probability space of events X. Given probability space X is the formalized World
of events.

M

In other words it is necessary to look at space-time

from two sides, on the one
hand as on set of the elements named elementary (atomic) events and to say that

as it is accepted in probability theory; on

the other hand as on coordinate space (arithmetic arena), for example, IR4 which is
used for formalization of concepts of the World of events.

Let’s notice, that at the description of deterministic processes and the phenom-
ena, and also at the description of stochastic processes and the phenomena which
are not touching a nature as of space, and time, we use only the second point of
view on the World of events, but the stochastic processes concerning of nature of
time require to distinguish two sides of the World of events.

Above we used space-time as coordinate space that elementary event could re-
ceive epoch on ”an axis of time”. This epoch does not lie in ”strictly allocated place”
according to the ”instruction” of the time order, but can occupy any place on ”an
axis of time” not especially caring of instructions of the mentioned time order. This
concerns and to spatial coordinates of events. So with the formula (5) it is possible
to deduce similar formulas for mean square deviations of x
coordinates
of events.

Let’s note one more circumstance. Time as it is found out in this work can be
not only deterministic time-stream connected with classical representation of Newton
about time as about duration and, accordingly, with concept of the time order, but
can be stochastic time-epoch, having such characteristic as density probability.

The last sets in the certain sense intensity of display (demonstration) of events
of the phenomenon on a segment of uniformly (current) time-stream. Here it would
be pertinent to recollect that N.A.Kozyrev wrote about density of time describing
its intensity in his articles [8]. And though in our case the question is stochastic
properties of time nevertheless it is possible to be surprised the intuition of Pulkov
astronomer.

ABSTRACT: We show that the problem of unifying electromagnetism with gravity has

an elegant solution in classical physics through the phenomenon of induction. By studying

the way that induction leads to the formation of electromagnetic ﬁelds, we identify the
classical ﬁeld equations which the uniﬁed ﬁeld must satisfy and a corresponding set of

constitutive equations for the medium sustaining the ﬁeld. The uniﬁcation problem is
then reduced to the problem of ﬁnding the exact form of these constitutive equations for

diﬀerent media by experiments.

Introduction

The problem of unifying gravitational ﬁelds with electric and magnetic ﬁelds is known to be one
of the most pressing in contemporary physics, not only for theoretical reasons, but also because
of the many uses to which electromagnetic ﬁelds which are formed by the uniﬁcation of electric
and magnetic ﬁelds have been put in science, engineering and business. While many diﬀerent
solutions to the problem have been proposed [1, 2, 3, 4], to date none of these solutions has had
much success in the sense of having the character of the uniﬁcation accomplished by Maxwell.
One reason why Maxwell may have succeeded where current theories fail is that he was guided by
a mechanism describing the formation of an electromagnetic ﬁeld while current theories abolish
any such mechanism. By this we mean that an electromagnetic ﬁeld is treated nowadays as a
monolithic entity that manifests sometimes as a magnetic ﬁeld and sometimes as an electric ﬁeld,
and not as a more complex ﬁeld formed by interaction between the much simpler electric and
magnetic ﬁelds. A consequence of this treatment is that one has no extra degree of freedom or
guiding principle with which to introduce gravity into the framework of Maxwell’s theory. On the
other hand, if we grant for a moment that an electromagnetic ﬁeld is a composite entity, it follows
that we must ﬁrst understand the process by which it is formed before tackling the problem of
unifying it with gravity. In this case the problem of uniﬁcation will have a diﬀerent meaning and
scope, namely, to ﬁnd the process by which electric, magnetic and gravitational ﬁelds can interact
with one another to form more complex (electromagnetic, electrogravitic, etc) ﬁelds in a medium.
In Maxwell’s early approach to his theory, this process was assumed to be mechanical and an
attempt was made to construct a detailed model of its operations based on diﬀerent ether theories
of the time. In more recent theories, attempts are made to construct a model by which gravity may
be reduced to electromagnetism [5, 6]. While these model-building approaches are not without
merit, they appear to be inherently superﬁcial, and for that reason, we shall focus on obtaining
a solution to the problem from a diﬀerent approach. We elaborate this new approach, which is
based on Newton’s theory of gravitation and Hertz’s version [7] of Maxwell’s theory [8], by ﬁrst
giving an interpretation of Hertz’s equations that eliminates the ether concept as in [9, 10] but
has the advantage that in it, the equations are not postulated but derived from ﬁrst principles.
The derivation will show that Hertz’s equations diﬀer from Maxwell’s equations due to the way
the concepts of electric current and emf are treated in Hertz’s theory. This will be shown in the
next two sections. In section §4 we will describe how electric and magnetic ﬁelds interact through
induction to form an electromagnetic ﬁeld in Hertz’s theory. In section §5 and section §6 we will
show that induction reduces the problem of unifying electromagnetism and gravity to the problem
of ﬁnding the constitutive equations for the uniﬁed ﬁeld if Newton’s theory is taken into account.
In section §7 and section §8 we will discuss some implications of this method of uniﬁcation. Finally,
in section §9, we will conclude the paper with a discussion of the main results and present some
suggestions for further research1.

2 Electric Fields

We begin by assuming that in Hertz’s theory, the strength or intensity of an electric ﬁeld can be
characterized at any point r and time t by a vector which we shall denote by D(r, t). Since it will
1It is pertinent to note here that “Maxwell’s theory” as used in the rest of this paper refers to the theory as

currently understood and not as originally proposed by Maxwell.

clearly not be possible for us to describe an electric ﬁeld mathematically in Hertz’s theory if this
vector is all we have, we shall introduce other parameters in addition to this vector. But in order
for us to be able to compare Hertz’s theory with Maxwell’s, these additional parameters must be
chosen to correspond as closely as possible to familiar quantities. For this reason we introduce
parameter Q which is the ﬂux of D through an element dS of a surface S:

and parameter i which is the ﬂux of the time derivative of D through the surface element dS:

dQ = D · dS

di = Je · dS, Je = dD/dt.

In familiar terms parameter Q may be called an electric charge while parameter i may be called
an electric current, and since these equations are the deﬁnitions of these parameters in Hertz’s
theory, vector D is fundamental and may be regarded as the source of Q while its time derivative
Je may be regarded as the source of i. This means that unlike in Maxwell’s theory where charges
and currents give cause to a ﬁeld, in Hertz’s theory, it is the ﬁeld that gives cause to charge and
current.

Now if S is a closed surface bounding a region R of space, and if Gauss’ divergence theorem ([11],

p532) holds for D in this region, it follows from (1) that

where σ = dQ/dV and dV is a volume element of R. Similarly, if Gauss’ theorem holds for Je in
R, it follows from (2) that

where η = di/dV . When the electric current i in a region is independent of the volume V of the
region, as experiments show to be the case (e.g. in thin and thick wires), we have η = 0 and the
above equation implies that a vector H exists such that

This is Ampere’s law. If experiments were to show that the electric current i in a region varies
linearly with the volume V of the region, then η = 3ke = constant and it will follow from (4) that

Thus Ampere’s law may have diﬀerent forms for diﬀerent η in Hertz’s theory.

Inspection shows that there is nothing in the derivation of (5) to suggest that H describes
a ﬁeld in the physical sense. If we assume that H does describe a ﬁeld, there is nothing in the
derivation to suggest that the ﬁeld described by H is physically caused or induced by D. If we
assume this as well, there is still nothing in the derivation to suggest that the ﬁeld described by
H is magnetic. As we shall see later, one cannot always assume that H describes a magnetic ﬁeld
in Hertz’s theory. Diﬀerentiating D(r, t) with respect to time gives

Je = ∂D/∂t + j,

j = (u · ∇)D

where u = dr/dt. Vector identities for the curl of a vector product and the gradient of a scalar
product ([12], p57) can be used to rewrite j as

j = σu + ∇ × (D × u) − D(∇ · u) + (D · ∇)u
j = ∇(D · u) − (D · ∇)u − D × (∇ × u) − u × (∇ × D)

which shows that Hertz’s theory has a convection current density σu and a conduction current
density j − σu like Maxwell’s theory. The signiﬁcance of this result will be discussed later.

3 Magnetic Fields

By analogy with electric ﬁelds, we assume that in Hertz’s theory the intensity of a magnetic ﬁeld
can be characterized at point r and time t by a vector B(r, t). To describe the ﬁeld mathematically,
we introduce parameter Φ which is the ﬂux of B through an element dS of a surface S

and parameter ξ which is the inward ﬂux of the time derivative of B through dS:

dΦ = B · dS

dξ = Jm · dS, Jm = −dB/dt.

In familiar terms parameter Φ may be called a magnetic ﬂux while parameter ξ may be called an
emf, but in Hertz’s theory, one may also call Φ a magnetic charge and ξ a magnetic current by
analogy with (1) and (2).

If S is a closed surface bounding a region R of space, and if Gauss’ theorem holds for B in this

region, it follows from (8) that

where δ = dΦ/dV and dV is a volume element of R. Similarly, if Gauss’ theorem holds for Jm in
R, it follows from (9) that

where ϑ = dξ/dV . In particular when the emf ξ in a region is independent of the volume V of the
region, as experiments show to be the case (e.g. in small and large voltaic cells), we have ϑ = 0
and the last equation implies that a vector E exists such that

This is Faraday’s law. If experiments were to show that ξ varies linearly with the volume V of the
region, then ϑ = 3km = constant and it will follow from (11) that

Thus Faraday’s law may have diﬀerent forms for diﬀerent ϑ in Hertz’s theory.

Equation (12a) diﬀers from Faraday’s law in Maxwell’s theory in two ways. First, there is
nothing in the derivation of this equation to suggest that E describes a ﬁeld or that the ﬁeld it
describes is electric or physically induced by B. We may assume that E describes a ﬁeld induced
by B, but as we shall see later, one cannot always assume that E describes an electric ﬁeld in
Hertz’s theory. Second, this equation contains an extra term that is not present in Maxwell’s
theory. We can see this clearly by diﬀerentiating B(r, t) with respect to time to get

Jm = −∂B/∂t − b, b = (u · ∇)B

which, when substituted into (12a), yields

∇ × E = −∂B/∂t − b.

The term b in this equation arises because of the way an emf ξ is deﬁned in Hertz’s theory. For
if we were to deﬁne an emf ξ′ by

∇ · B = δ

∇ · Jm = ϑ

∇ × E = Jm.

∇ × E = Jm − kmr.

as in Maxwell’s theory, then one can take (8) into account to get

Thus when dξ′/dV = 0, we get ∇ × E = −∂B/∂t − δu and since δ = 0 identically in Maxwell’s
theory, Faraday’s law is obtained as ∇ × E = −∂B/∂t.

It is interesting to note that if one deﬁnes an electric current not by (2) but as

by analogy with (15), then by (1) one would have

which shows that if (19) is correct, then a conduction current density j − σu should not exist.

But if one were to deﬁne an electric current by (2) as in Hertz’s theory, then by subtracting

(21) from (2) and taking (6) into account, one gets

instead of (19). Similarly, by subtracting (17) from (9) and taking (13) into account, one gets

instead of (15). To calculate ξ by this equation it is useful to rewrite b as

b = δu + ∇ × (B × u) − B(∇ · u) + (B · ∇)u
b = ∇(B · u) − (B · ∇)u − B × (∇ × u) − u × (∇ × B)

by analogy with (7).

4 Formation Of Electromagnetic Fields

We have noted that in Hertz’s theory, one can only assume that E describes a ﬁeld induced by B
because there is nothing in the derivation of (12) to suggest that the ﬁeld described by E is electric.
If it is known however that B induces an electric ﬁeld in a particular medium, then one may for
this reason assume that E describes an electric ﬁeld in that medium. Theoretically, the possibility

Uniﬁcation By Induction

Adequest Corporation

GEM-2000-01D

must be allowed that B may induce diﬀerent kinds of ﬁelds in diﬀerent media. For example, as far
as theory is concerned, there may be media in which B induces a magnetic ﬁeld. In such media
one must assume that E describes a magnetic ﬁeld according to Hertz’s theory. Furthermore, if E
describes a magnetic ﬁeld or an electric ﬁeld in a medium, then according to Hertz’s theory, one
should expect E to be a function of B or D in the medium respectively. To illustrate this idea
(which we shall call the principle of induction), suppose we know that D induces a magnetic ﬁeld
and that B induces an electric ﬁeld in a medium. Then in this medium, H (i.e. the ﬁeld induced
by D) describes a magnetic ﬁeld and is therefore a function of B while E (i.e. the ﬁeld induced
by B) describes an electric ﬁeld and is therefore a function of D:

What if D induces an electric ﬁeld and B induces a magnetic ﬁeld in a medium ? Then in this
medium,

What if D induces both types of ﬁelds in a medium and B does likewise ? Then in this medium,

H = H(B), E = E(D).

H = H(D), E = E(B).

H = H(D, B), E = E(D, B).

(27a)

(27b)

(27c)

Constitutive equations like these describe interactions between the electric ﬁeld D and the mag-
netic ﬁeld B in Hertz’s theory in the following sense.

Suppose that (27a) holds in a medium. Then in this medium B induces a ﬁeld E that is related
to D while D induces a ﬁeld H that is related to B. Fields B and D interact in this way with each
other to form an electromagnetic ﬁeld in the medium. In the same way if (27c) holds in a medium,
each ﬁeld interacts with itself as well as with the other ﬁeld so that one can speak of the presence of
an electromagnetic ﬁeld in the medium. But if (27b) holds in a medium, D induces a ﬁeld H that
is related to D while B induces a ﬁeld E that is related to B. Each of B and D interacts with itself
but not with the other ﬁeld and they therefore do not form an electromagnetic ﬁeld in the medium.
These examples give a clear picture of how an electromagnetic ﬁeld is formed in Hertz’s theory.
One sees clearly that (27b) is not admissible as constitutive equations for an electromagnetic ﬁeld
in Hertz’s theory. This fact is taken for granted in Maxwell’s theory where the formation of an
electromagnetic ﬁeld is less explicit. The fundamental vectors of an electromagnetic ﬁeld in Hertz’s
theory are also seen to be D and B, not E or H, because according to the principle of induction
the nature of the ﬁelds described by E and H is not known until the constitutive equations for a
medium are given, whereas D always describes an electric ﬁeld and B always describes a magnetic
ﬁeld. Thus Hertz’s theory leaves no room for debate concerning the physical interpretation of
these vectors [13, 14].

5 Uniﬁcation With Gravity

Electromagnetism and gravity can be uniﬁed by the principle of induction if we assume that
electric and magnetic ﬁelds can induce a gravitational ﬁeld and that a gravitational ﬁeld can
induce electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We need two more vectors in order to perform the uniﬁcation
theoretically: one vector g to describe a gravitational ﬁeld and another vector N to describe a
ﬁeld induced by g. Using these vectors, interactions between electric, magnetic and gravitational
ﬁelds can be described as in the previous section. Thus if B induces a gravitational ﬁeld, then
E describes a gravitational ﬁeld and is therefore a function of g. If g induces an electric ﬁeld,
then N describes an electric ﬁeld and is therefore a function of D, et cetera. Similarly to how an
electromagnetic ﬁeld is formed, a gravoelectromagnetic ﬁeld may be formed in a medium if electric,
magnetic and gravitational ﬁelds interact mutually in the medium. This may occur in the simplest
case if g induces an electric ﬁeld, D induces a magnetic ﬁeld, and B induces a gravitational ﬁeld
in a medium:

N = N(D), H = H(B), E = E(g)

(28a)

Page 6

Uniﬁcation By Induction

Adequest Corporation

April 2000

GEM-2000-01D

or alternatively, if g induces a magnetic ﬁeld, B induces an electric ﬁeld, and D induces a gravi-
tational ﬁeld in the medium:

N = N(B), E = E(D), H = H(g).

(28b)

As we shall see later, these equations are a special case of a more general set of equations.

We need a suitable gravitational theory for g and N in order to complete the uniﬁcation.
If Newton’s theory is adopted for this purpose, the strength or intensity of a gravitational ﬁeld
can be characterized at any point r and time t by a vector g(r, t) = a/4πG where a(r, t) is the
acceleration due to gravity and G is the gravitational constant2. We introduce parameter m which
is the ﬂux of g through an element dS of a surface S:

and parameter h which is the ﬂux of the time derivative of g through dS:

dm = g · dS

dh = Jg · dS, Jg = dg/dt.

In familiar terms parameter m is clearly a gravitational mass, but as there is no obvious name for
parameter h, let us call it a gravitational current for the moment.

If S is a closed surface bounding a region R of space, and if Gauss’ theorem holds for g in this

region, then from (29) we have

where ρ = dm/dV and dV is a volume element of R. Similarly, if Gauss’ theorem holds for Jg in
this region, then from (30) we have

where ̟ = dh/dV . In particular if h does not depend on the volume V of a region, then ̟ = 0
and it follows from the last equation that a vector N exists such that

∇ · g = ρ

∇ · Jg = ̟

∇ × N = Jg.

This is the gravitational analogue of Ampere’s and Faraday’s laws. If h were to vary linearly with
the volume V of a region, then ̟ = 3kg = constant and it will follow from (32) that

Diﬀerentiating g(r, t) gives

while similarly to (7) we have

∇ × N = Jg − kgr.

Jg = ∂g/∂t + s,

s = (u · ∇)g

s = ρu + ∇ × (g × u) − g(∇ · u) + (g · ∇)u
s = ∇(g · u) − (g · ∇)u − g × (∇ × u) − u × (∇ × g)

and by arguing as in the derivation of (24) we get

h = dm/dt +

(s − ρu) · dS.

Z

These equations show that a gravitational current is a mass ﬂow, so there is a familiar name for
the concept after all.

2Note that g should be regarded as a new fundamental quantity and g = a/4πG should be regarded as a

hypothetical relation and not as a deﬁnition of g.

6 Gravoelectromagnetic Waves

We have synthesized Newton’s theory and Hertz’s version of Maxwell’s theory into a gravoelectro-
magnetic (GEM) theory that uniﬁes electromagnetism and gravity in classical terms. Our results
show that an electric ﬁeld D is described by the ﬁeld equations

while a magnetic ﬁeld B is described by the ﬁeld equations

and a gravitational ﬁeld g is described by the ﬁeld equations

∇ · D = σ

∇ × H = ∂D/∂t + j

∇ × E = −∂B/∂t − b

j = (u · ∇)D

∇ · B = δ

b = (u · ∇)B

∇ · g = ρ

∇ × N = ∂g/∂t + s

s = (u · ∇)g.

The ﬁelds interact in a medium through induction and their interaction is described mathemati-
cally by the constitutive equations of the medium. Following the discussion in the last two sections,
it is clear that the most general type of interaction occurs if g induces all three types of ﬁelds in
a medium, D does the same, and likewise B:

N = N(D, B, g), H = H(D, B, g), E = E(D, B, g).

(40)

Equations (28) are simpler forms of (40); equations (27) are also simpler forms of (40) if one
neglects gravity.

Now if GEM ﬁelds exist, it may be possible for them to propagate through space as waves. As
a trivial but illustrative example of how this might occur, suppose that (28a) holds in a medium
and that in this medium, the equation has the form

D = ǫN, B = µH,

g = αE

(41)

where ǫ, µ, α are independent of time t and position r. Then in this medium, the ﬁeld equations
will be

∇ · D = σ

∇ × B = µ(∂D/∂t + j)

j = (u · ∇)D

(45)

The terms containing b, s and j can be simpliﬁed if we know u(r, t). Restricting ourselves to
uniform translational motion, for which u is independent of time and position, it is easy to verify
that the following equalities hold:

∂2s/∂t2 = (u · ∇)(∂2g/∂t2)

∇ × (∇ × b) = ǫµ(u · ∇)(∂2g/∂t2) + 2ǫµ(u · ∇)2(∂g/∂t) + ǫµ(u · ∇)3g
∂(∇ × j)/∂t = ǫ(u · ∇)(∂2g/∂t2) + ǫ(u · ∇)2(∂g/∂t).

Substituting these into (45) ﬁnally gives

∇ × ∇2g = αǫµ(∂/∂t + (u · ∇))3g.

To ﬁnd the conditions under which a ﬁeld described by this equation will propagate as plane
monochromatic waves of the form

where g0, ω and κ are independent of time and position, let us substitute this form into the
previous equation to get the dispersion equation

It follows from this equation that in order for the ﬁeld to propagate, g must be parallel to κ and
the speed of the wave must be

g = g0 cos(ωt − κ · r)

κ2(κ × g) = αǫµ(ω + u · κ)3g.

υ = ω/κ = −u cos θ

where θ is the angle between the observer’s velocity u and the wave vector κ and the negative sign
indicates that the ﬁeld propagates in a direction opposite to the observer’s motion. We conclude
that if (41) holds in a medium, then in this medium the GEM ﬁeld may propagate as a longitudinal
wave with a speed that depends only on the observer’s motion and not on the material constants
ǫ, µ, α of the medium – a sharp contrast to the familiar behaviour of electromagnetic ﬁelds.

7 Heat And Gravity

Consider again the hypothesis that E is a function of D in some medium. It is easy to test this
hypothesis by experiments because according to the principle of induction, E must describe an
electric ﬁeld in the medium, and since E is by deﬁnition the strength of a ﬁeld induced by a (time
varying) magnetic ﬁeld B, it follows that a time varying magnetic ﬁeld should induce an electric
ﬁeld in the medium. This in turn means that under the right circumstances, the induced electric
ﬁeld should produce an electric current in the medium or cause the medium to be polarized. By
similar reasoning, the hypothesis that H is a function of B in a medium implies that a time varying
electric ﬁeld should produce an emf in the medium or cause the medium to be magnetized; and
the hypothesis that H (or E ) is a function of both D and B in a medium means clearly that a
time varying electric (or magnetic) ﬁeld should produce both an electric current and an emf in
the medium, or cause the medium to be both polarized and magnetized.

But what about gravity ? Well, the hypothesis that H is a function of g in a medium for
example implies that a time varying electric ﬁeld should produce a gravitational current in the
medium. But we have seen previously that (1) a time varying electric ﬁeld constitutes an electric
current, (2) a gravitational current is a mass ﬂow, and (3) we know from experience that a mass
ﬂow is almost invariably accompanied by a heat ﬂow. We are led to conclude therefore that if
H is a function of g in a medium, then an electric current should produce heat in the medium.
Conversely, if we know that an electric current produces heat in a medium, we may argue that
H must be a function of g in the medium. This line of reasoning suggests that thermoelectric
phenomena are electrogravitic in nature, for when heat produces an electric current and an electric
current produces heat in a medium, we have in this medium that H = H(g), N = N(D) which
together with (37b) and (39b) describe an electrogravitic ﬁeld in the medium. Similarly, we are led
to conclude that thermomagnetic phenomena in which heat produces an emf and an emf produces
heat are essentially gravomagnetic, since in this case we have for the medium in question that
E = E(g), N = N(B) which together with (38b) and (39b) describe a gravomagnetic ﬁeld in the
medium.

Given a medium and an arbitrary set of constitutive equations, we are now able to verify
qualitatively whether or not the medium satisﬁes the equations. Hence if we have the equations
H = H(B), E = E(g), N = N(D), we know that in any conducting medium that satisﬁes these
equations, (a) an electric current should produce an emf, (b) an emf should produce heat, and
(c) heat should produce an electric current. Similarly, in any conducting medium satisfying H =
H(B, g), E = E(g, D), N = N(D, B), we have that (a) an electric current should produce both
heat and emf, (b) an emf should produce both heat and electric current, and (c) heat should
produce both emf and electric current. The point illustrated by these examples (which the reader
may have realized already) is that when a gravitational current is induced in a medium in the form
of heat, it indicates the presence of an induced gravitational ﬁeld in the medium in the same way
that an induced electric current indicates the presence of an induced electric ﬁeld in a medium.
From this viewpoint the results of recent experiments that suggest the existence of gravitational
shielding [15, 16, 17] are by no means implausible nor inexplicable. This is more so if we assume
that matter cannot only be polarized and magnetized but also gravitized, in which case the results
of the shielding experiments can be interpreted as indicative of the gravitization state of matter.
Further consideration of this subject is however outside the scope of this paper.

8 Classiﬁcation Of Gravoelectromagnetic Media

It is often instructive to show the structure of a set of constitutive equations in a so-called con-
stitutive diagram. To do so, we write down the pairs hH, Di, hE, Bi and hN, gi. Then, if H is
a function of B, for example, we draw an arrow from the pair containing H to the pair contain-
ing B; that is, from hH, Di to hE, Bi. As the examples in Figure 1 show, constitutive diagrams
make it easy to see the interactions described by a set of constitutive equations. They also make
it easy to see the types of uniﬁed ﬁelds implied by these interactions. Thus in Figure 1(c), the

arrows hH, Di→hN, gi, hN, gi→hE, Bi, and hE, Bi→hH, Di indicate a gravoelectromagnetic ﬁeld
because they form a closed loop containing all three ﬁelds. Since the arrows hH, Di→hN, gi
and hN, gi→hH, Di also form a closed loop indicating an electrogravitic ﬁeld, it follows that any
medium whose constitutive equations correspond to Figure 1(c) will be able to sustain both a
gravoelectromagnetic ﬁeld and an electrogravitic ﬁeld.

Considering that a constitutive equation such as H = H(D, B) describes a class of media
rather than a single medium, it is useful to identify all classes of media described in this way
together with the uniﬁed ﬁelds that each class supports. To perform this exercise we shall ﬁrst
introduce the following rules for writing constitutive equations in a shorthand form : (1) omit the
equals sign and everything to its left; (2) omit the opening and closing parentheses on the right
hand side; (3) omit any commas on the right hand side; (4) write the vectors as scalars; (5) write
the constitutive equations for H, E, N in that order, separated by hyphens and subject to the
preceding conventions. By these rules, for examples, the constitutive equations in Figure 1(c) will
become HDg-ED-NDB while (28a) will become HB-Eg-ND and (28b) will become Hg-ED-NB.
Table 1 shows the result of the exercise. We refer to the columns (numbered 1 to 7) as groups,

Uniﬁcation By Induction

to the rows (lettered A to G) as clusters, and to the nested rows (lettered a to g) as families. To
deﬁne a set of constitutive equations with reference to this table, one needs to give the relevant
cluster, group and family in that order.

For example, the constitutive equations H = H(D, B), E = E(B, g), N = N(D, g) yield the
shorthand equation (also called the signature) HDB - EBg - NDg which according to Table 1
describes a class D6e medium. Conversely, for a class B3a medium, Table 1 gives the signature
HB - Eg - ND which in turn gives the constitutive equations H = H(B), E = E(g), N = N(D).
The constitution table is useful because it categorizes media with similar properties together in the
same way that the periodic table categorizes the chemical elements. Group 3 media for example
have the property that in them, E is a function of g, which means that in these media an emf can
produce heat. Similarly, cluster F media can be seen to have the property that in them H is a
function of B and g, which means that in these media an electric current can produce both heat
and emf.

9 Discussion And Conclusion

Equations (37) and (38) are the same equations postulated by Hertz in 1892 except that Hertz
added another parameter to (37c) and assumed that u described the absolute motion of an observer
relative to a luminiferous ether. The additional parameter was thought to be necessary in order
for the theory to treat convection and conduction currents; it has been omitted from consideration
because one can treat these currents via j as (7) shows. If one is not interested in the motion
that produces j, then one can ignore this equation and treat j as in Maxwell’s theory. If one is
interested in this motion, however, then one must take (7) into account. In this and all other
equations vector u is the velocity of point r where one is observing a ﬁeld at time t and can be
interpreted as the velocity of an observer (or ﬁeld detector, probe, etc) at this point; it is not
measured relative to ether but relative to the point that one chooses as the origin of coordinates
for the position vector r in the analytic expressions for the ﬁeld vectors D(r, t), B(r, t) and g(r,
t). If δ = 0, b = 0 and one ignores both (37c) and (38c), then (37) and (38) become Maxwell’s
equations. This means that Hertz’s theory satisﬁes the correspondence principle in the sense that
all phenomena described by Maxwell’s equations are also described by Hertz’s equations. Since
Maxwell’s theory describes the electrodynamics of stationary bodies (as is well known), formal
correspondence exists with Hertz’s theory only for phenomena related to the electrodynamics of
stationary bodies.

For phenomena related to the electrodynamics of moving bodies, signiﬁcant diﬀerences be-
tween both theories exist. These diﬀerences arise from the fact that problems of moving bodies
electrodynamics must be treated in Maxwell’s theory via special relativity and in Hertz’s theory
via vector u. Equation (37c) for example shows how the current density j arises from motion in
Hertz’s theory. While Maxwell’s theory also recognizes that j arises from motion, the theory gives
no general expression for j in terms of this motion. Historically, this situation arose because when
Maxwell ﬁrst introduced (2) into his theory, he considered Je to be an independent parameter.
He later realized that for a time varying ﬁeld, Je could not strictly be independent of D. So he
introduced the displacement density ∂D/∂t into his theory and by doing this made Je depend
partially on D while retaining j as an independent parameter [18, 19]. Hertz would argue that
since the displacement density arises from temporal changes in D, it is natural to suppose that the
total density Je also does. This is why Je is deﬁned in Hertz’s theory as the total time derivative
of D. The corresponding deﬁnition for Jm follows by symmetry and Lenz’s law.

Hertz’s theory suggests that one should call E the strength or induction of a magnetoinduced
(i.e. magnetically induced) ﬁeld and H the strength or induction of an electroinduced (i.e. elec-
trically induced) ﬁeld because by the principle of induction, the nature of the ﬁelds described by
these vectors depend on the constitutive equations of a medium and, for this reason, one should
not describe E as electric nor H as magnetic without further qualiﬁcations. Also, the theory
implies that an electric current or emf may exist in situations where neither would be expected
according to Maxwell’s theory. Equation (25) shows for example that an emf may exist when a

magnetic ﬂux is not changing with time (dΦ/dt = 0), contrary to (15). We know that an emf has
been observed in the Kennard-M¨uller homopolar induction eﬀect that apparently should not have
existed according to Maxwell’s theory [20, 21]. This gives qualitative support for (25); quantitative
support can be obtained by showing that the observed emf in this eﬀect is consistent with (25),
but this is outside the scope of this paper. Interestingly, according to (26a), the extraneous emf
due to b should exist for δ = 0 as well as for δ 6= 0. This means that one cannot omit b from
(38b) on the grounds that δ = 0 identically.

It is also interesting to note that Ampere’s law and Faraday’s law are valid only when di/dV = 0

and dξ/dV = 0 in a region. From (4) and (6), we get

while from (11) and (13), we get

both of which will be recognized as continuity equations for D and B. This means that Ampere’s
law and Faraday’s law are valid only when there is conservation of electric charge and magnetic
ﬂux in a region; or, equivalently, when the electric current i and the emf ξ in a region are both
independent of the volume of the region. This is known to be the case from elementary experiments
on thin and thick wires on the one hand, and from similar experiments on small and large voltaic
cells on the other.

Regarding gravity, we have shown that the introduction of parameter h invariably leads to the
existence of vector N which is the gravitational analogue of E and H. Using this vector and the
principle of induction, we gave a clear picture of how electric, magnetic, and gravitational ﬁelds
can interact in a medium to form more complex ﬁelds. Among other things our method reduces
the problem of unifying electromagnetism and gravity to the problem of ﬁnding the precise form
of (40) for a medium. The latter problem can be treated by studying the relationship between the
ﬁeld inductions H, E, N and the ﬁeld intensities D, B, g for diﬀerent media experimentally using
the hypothesis that a gravitational current manifests as heat, or by postulating diﬀerent forms
of (40) and studying the resulting properties of the uniﬁed ﬁeld theoretically. Both approaches
have led to interesting results which are outside the scope of this paper. There are of course
several ways in which the method of uniﬁcation described here can be further developed. These
include uniﬁcation with the microscopic weak and strong nuclear forces, an atomic theory of
the constitution table explaining the formation of each class of GEM media, a retarded integral
formulation of the GEM ﬁeld equations similarly to Jeﬁmenko’s theory [22], and a more detailed
investigation of the relationship between heat and gravity. In addition, as many useful solutions
to the problems of moving bodies electrodynamics as are possible need to be obtained in order to
realize the full potential of the theory.

This paper is dedicated to the late Mr. Sunday Otusanya, of loving and blessed memory, with a
prayer that his soul rests in peace, amen.

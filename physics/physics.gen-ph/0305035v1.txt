Abstract

We review Cantorian and Non Commutative Spacetime, work which
has occupied El Naschie in the past several years. These concepts
are now the subject of intense research, thanks to Quantum Gravity,
Quantum Super String Theory and a few other approaches. It now
appears that we are on the verge of a breakthrough in ﬁnding solu-
tions to longstanding problems, like the uniﬁcation of gravitation with
other fundamental interactions and the question of the mass spectrum,
another recent area of El Naschie’s work.

1 Introduction

It is now a cliche that the two great intellectual pillars of the twentieth cen-
tury, viz., General Relativity or, more generally, Gravitation and Quantum
Mechanics have stood apart, stubbornly defying attempts at unifying them.
As Wheeler [1] noted, the problem ﬁnally boils down to the introduction of
the Quantum Mechanical concept of spin half into Classical Theory and the
classical concept of curvature into Quantum Theory. Curiously enough the
two pillars of General Relativity and Quantum Theory stand on a common
ground: Together they use the concept of a diﬀerentiable space time mani-
fold, be it the Reimannian space time of General Relativity or the Minkowski
space time of Relativistic Quantum Theory or Quantum Field Theory. How-
ever more recent work be it in Quantum Gravity or in Quantum Super String
Theory, has hinted at a minimum space time cut oﬀ [2, 3, 4]. This alters the

age cold concept of a smooth space time.
quite some work by diﬀerent authors such as Ord, Nottale, El Naschie, the
author and others in this relatively new ﬁeld of non diﬀerentiable space time
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and several references therein. One of the very fruit-
ful concepts put forward in these pathbreaking eﬀorts has been El Naschie’s
concept of the Cantorian space time. Atlast some schoalrs are beginning to
realize the fractal nature of space time. Once we break out of the smooth
spacetime mindset, many exciting possibilities open up, including a uniﬁca-
tion of gravitation with other fundamental interactions, and also the possibil-
ity of solving the elusive problem of the mass spectrum, as has been deduced
by El Naschie for example [38].
We will brieﬂy survey some of these eﬀorts and indicate how the solution of
longstanding problems are now within sight.

2 Non Commutative Spacetime

We start with a Quantum Mechanical description. In Quantum Theory, it
is well known that spacetime points pose a major diﬃculty. By the Uncer-
tainity principle, if we go down to such points, we will end up with inﬁnite
momenta and energies. This situation comes up clearly in the case of the
Quantum Mechanical treatment of the electron [12]. We encounter electrons
with the velocity of light and rapid oscillations termed zitterbewegung. At
that time Dirac realised this problem and correctly explained the anamoly by
noting that only observations averaged over small intervals at the Compton
scale are physically meaningful. Within the Compton scale there are well
known non local eﬀects. This is a major departure from classical considera-
tions where we use spacetime points.
Nevertheless Quantum Theory has continued using classical space time as
a background. This has lead, for example to the problem of inﬁnities and
resonances found by Poincare much earlier in classical theory [13]. For ex-
ample in Classical Electrodynamics, the relativistic generalisation of the well
known Lorentz equation is the Lorentz-Dirac equation. This equation shows
unphysical characteristics, such as third derivatives with respect to time, run
away solutions with inﬁnite energy and so on [13, 14]. The inﬁnite energy
in this case is attributed to the inﬁnite energy which an electron, treated as
a spherical shell, acquires when the radius of the shell tends to zero. But it
is remarkable that even in Classical Electrodynamics the inﬁnities and non

2

local eﬀects are conﬁned to the same Quantum Mechanical Compton scale
[14].
One way in which Quantum Field Theory has dodged these unpleasant fea-
tures is by using the renormalization technique. To put it brieﬂy, the physical
quantity we observe, for example the mass or charge consist of two compo-
nents: One is the “actual” or bare value and the other is a value due to
the above eﬀects. What is important ultimately is the physical quantity we
observe. So if we can ﬁnd a model in which the bare value and the inﬁnite
value somehow add up to give the correct physical value in the limit, then the
theory is renormalizable, because in any case what happens within the small
intervals is ultimately of no consequence [15, 16]. Dirac himself was critical
of this approach and predicted that one day it would be proved wrong [17].
He observed, “I am inclined to suspect that the renormalization theory is
something that will not survive in the future, and that the remarkable agree-
ment between its results and experiment should be looked on as a ﬂuke.”
In parallel a number of scholars such as Snyder had tried to work out theo-
ries which recognized minimum intervals as a way to eliminate the inﬁnities
[18, 19, 11].This work did not ﬁnd favour for many years.
However relatively recent developments from two separate directions, that of
Quantum Gravity and Quantum Super String theory have lead back to the
notion of a minimum space time scale [3, 2, 4]: The Planck Scale (10−33cms
and 10−43secs) which is the Compton scale for a particle with a Planck mass,
10−5gms. Interestingly Max Planck himself had noted that the Planck scale
is made up of a combination of the fundamental constants and therefore must
be fundamental. In recent years there has been a growing body of literature
which argues that the Planck scale is indeed such a fundamental minimum
scale.
The introduction of such a minimum scale, instead of space time points leads
to consequences far beyond the classical description. Space time now becomes
non commutative [20, 21], the Uncertainity principle takes on an extra term,
sometimes called the duality term [21, 22] and so on. Speciﬁcally, we have,

[x, y] = (ıa2/¯h)Lz, [t, x] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mx,

[y, z] = (ız2/¯h)Lx, [t, y] = (ıa2/¯hc)My,
[x, x] = (ıa2¯h)Ly, [t, z] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mz,
[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2
x];

[x, py] = [y, px] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpy;
[x, pt] = c2[px, t] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpt; etc.
Non relativistic Quantum Theory follows from (1) if a2 is neglected, though
spacetime is now commutative as in the usual theory. The modiﬁcation to
0(a2) are
the Uncertainity Principle is seen in equation (2) when terms
retained. All this also averts, what Wheeler had called the greatest crisis
of Physics, namely the space time singularity of the point spacetime theory,
indeed as the point no longer exists.
It can be argued that the space time generally used in Classical theory and
Quantum Theory is an approximation, which smoothens out an underpinning
chaotic behavior at the Planck scale [23, 24]. Indeed as Wheeler himself ob-
served, “No prediction of space time, therefore no meaning for space time is
the verdict.... That object which is central to all of classical general relativity,
the four dimensional space time geometry, simply does not exist, except in
a classical approximation.... One has to forego that view of nature in which
every event, past, present, or future, occupies its preordained position in a
grand catalog called “space time”....”[1]. This approximate classical space
time is quasi- changeless or stationary and time is reversible, as indeed is
evident from the equations of motion both in Classical Physics and Quan-
tum Physics. But when we go beyond this approximation, to the stochastic
description at the Planck scale [23] time is no longer reversible. We make
the leap from the age old concept of “being” to the concept of “becoming”
at least at this scale.
One of the criticisms put forward against the Planck Scale Phenomena is that
these eﬀects are beyond experimental veriﬁcation for a long time to come.
But let us analyse this further. The Compton scale which we encounter in
the physical world has an underpinning of some n = 1040 transient Planck
particles. However Planck scale phenomena are moderated, and we have, as
in a diﬀusion process,

l = √nlP

m = mP /√n

(3)

(4)

where l and m are the Compton wavelength and mass of a typical elemen-
tary particle and lP and mP are the Planck length and the Planck mass. An
equation identical to (3) holds for the Compton time also.

4

×

(3) and (4) are not mere numerical accidents - they can be deduced as men-
tioned from a diﬀusion process [23]. The √n in the equations is indicative
of a Brownian process. For example, in a random walk of n steps, each of
length l, the total distance covered would be of the order of √nl.
Infact we can go one step further. Remembering that there are a total of
N = 1080 elementary particles, the entire universe shows up as n
N = 10120
Planck scale oscillators. Using the fact that the rth energy led for the Har-
monic oscillators is given by √r¯hω for large r, [25] it follows that the total
energy of these Planck scale oscillators would be √nNmP c2, which correctly
gives the mass of the universe itself. That is, the universe is a normal mode
of these Planck scale oscillators.
We have already remarked that the Quantum commutators are present in
(1), if we neglect terms of the order of a2.
In particular, taking a to be
the Compton scale, it has been shown that we can recover from (1) and
(2) the Dirac equation itself[11]. This again is not surprising because the
non commutativity in (1) and (2) can be shown to represent spin even from
the classical viewpoint [26]. Interestingly, at the Compton scale it has been
shown that the Quantum coordinates coincide with the complex coordinates
of a classical Kerr-Newman Black Hole with radius of the order of the Comp-
ton wavelength. Indeed it has been known for a long time that the classical
Kerr-Newman metric reproduces the ﬁeld of the electron including the purely
Quantum Mechanical gyro magnetic ratio g = 2. What has been inexplicable
is the fact that there is a naked singularity or equivalently complex coordi-
nates. This infact is a direct consequence of the non commutativity [11].
In other words once the non commutative or fuzzy nature of spacetime is
taken into consideration, corresponding to averages over zitterbewegung in
Realtivistic Quantum Theory, the naked singularity disappears and the elec-
tron can be represented by the Kerr-Newman metric. These conclusions have
since been conﬁrmed by Nottale [27]. Already this Kerr-Newman character-
ization of the Quantum Mechanical electron points to the long sought after
linkage between gravitation and electromagnetism [28]. It can be shown for-
mally that this is so [29, 20, 22]. Infact arising from (1) there is the covariant
derivative

The second term on the right of (5) represents the electromagnetic potential,
and surprisingly coincides with the original Weyl formulation of electromag-
netism.

Surprising as it may seem there is a cosmological scheme which follows from
these considerations. It can be understood on the basis of the fact that in
the minimum time interval τ at the Compton scale ,√N particles are created
ﬂuctuationally from the Quantum vacuum, where N is the number of parti-
cles present at that epoch [30, 31, 32]. This cosmology successfully predicted
dark energy and an accelerating ever expanding universe since conﬁrmed by
observation [33, 34].
All this can also be shown to explain some hitherto inexplicable coincidences
noted by Weyl, Eddington, Dirac and Weinberg. These are relations like

and others. R is the radius of the universe, e is the electron charge, G the
universal constant of gravitation, c the velocity of light, ¯h the reduced Planck
constant and H the Hubble constant. It is easy and even unscientiﬁc to dis-
miss such equations as accidents. Dirac himself realised that equations (6)
and (7) for example could have a cosmological signiﬁcance [35]. There was
an inconsistency in his otherwise beautiful cosmology. More recently it has
been shown by the author that these coincidental equations (8) can be de-
duced, on the basis of the cosmology mentioned above. It may be mentioned
that Weinberg had termed the equation (8) as being mysterious because it
relates a large scale parameter like H, the Hubble constant to microphysical
constants [36]. This points to a Machian or “co-related” universe which is
not surprising because the universe as we have just seen, is a normal mode
of Planck oscillators.
In this consistent scheme, the universe is created out of a sub stratum Quan-
tum vaccuum or dark energy, in a phase transition at the Planck scale [37].
Herein are the very ﬁrst seeds for all the complex structures of the universe.

3 A Mass Spectrum

We can extend these considerations to generate a mass spectrum, a problem
that has fascinated El Naschie and for which his model gives a solution [38].

We now use the model of three oscillators (typically for the three quarks),
discussed in detail in references [39, 40, 11, 41]. We use the fact that for such
an oscillator (resembling a triatomic molecule) [42] the frequencies are given
by

ω =

k/m, 2

k/m

for one and two such oscillators where ¯hω = mc2, m being the mass.
For reasons discussed in detail in the references, we take the higher frequency
or mass to represent the pion mπ. In this connection, it may be mentioned
that the π0 meson has been shown to be a bound state of an electron and
positron in the discrete spacetime theory [11], borne out by its decay mode.
This was a starting point for El Naschie in his mass spectrum model. Then
from (9) we derive the mass spectrum from the oscillator energy levels viz.,

It is remarkable that the formula (10) generates a whole range of some 50
mesons and baryons including the well known particles from the particle
data group tables (Cf.refs.[43]), starting from the Kmeson (480meV approx-
imately) through several other mesons including the 2χ, D, f, ρ, Θ and so on
as also the very massive γ(1s), χ1p, γ2s, γ3s, γ4s, γ10860, B, J/(ψ1s) and so
on, going right up to values of n near 80 giving the heaviest of the particles
and clusters of masses nearby. Even in the approximation (10) where several
degrees of freedom and other details have been excluded, the agreement is
within a few percent of the actual values. Interestingly the latest particle
D5(2317) [44] also follows from (10), being apprxomately 17mπ. Incidentally
El Naschie’s mass spectrum can also start with the model of spring connected
oscillators [38].

Abstract

It is shown that the classical description of pair production eﬀect is pos-
sible, i.e. one can describe pair production without a reference to quantum
principles. Pair production appears at statistical description of stochastic rel-
ativistic particles. There is a special force ﬁeld which is responsible for pair
production. This ﬁeld is a reasonable consequence of quantum stochastic-
ity. Consideration of quantum systems as stochastic systems and statistical
description of them generates hydrodynamic interpretation of quantum phe-
nomena. In the collision problem the hydrodynamic interpretation appears to
be alternative to the conventional interpretation, based on quantum principles
and on consideration of the wave function as a principal object of dynamics.
Hydrodynamic interpretation leads to such a statement of the collision prob-
lem, which is alternative to the conventional S-matrix theory.

1 Introduction

Pair production is a speciﬁc quantum eﬀect. It is described conventionally in terms
of quantum theory. We do not know how to describe the pair production eﬀects in
classical terms. But if the classical description of the pair production were possible,
it would be very useful. Indeed, at high energies of particles their de Broglie wave
length λB = ~/p becomes to be very small, and description of high energy particles
becomes semiclassical or even classical. The classical description is simpler, than the
quantum one, because it uses less information and admits a simpler interpretation.
Unfortunately, we cannot realize advantages of classical description, because at high
energies the pair production processes are dominating, but we do not know how to
In general, we know about the pair production
describe them in classical terms.

only that it appears at collision of high energy particles, and it is described only in
terms of quantum theory. But what agents are responsible for the pair production
remains to be seen.

In this paper we are going to investigate what agents are responsible for the
pair production and to show that a classical description of pair production eﬀects
is possible. Speaking about classical description, we mean only that principles of
quantum mechanics are not used at such a description. Classical description does not
mean a classical approximation of quantum description. Our classical description
is an exact description. In particular, it describes quantum eﬀects, using quantum
constant ~, which appears as a constant describing the space-time properties (but
not as an attribute of quantum principles).

Such an approach is based on consideration of quantum mechanics as a special
case of the stochastic system dynamics [2]. The stochastic system dynamics is
suitable for description of any stochastic systems (not only quantum), and because
of this it cannot use quantum principles and does not use them. All description is
produced in classical (non-quantum) terms, although description in terms of wave
function is also possible as a special case of a description. Such an approach is very
convenient, because it gives a very simple interpretation of quantum eﬀects in terms
of classical dynamics of particles and ﬂuids.

The main distinction between the quantum mechanics and dynamics of stochastic
systems lies in their relation to the wave function. In the quantum mechanics the
wave function ψ is a fundamental object, whose properties are deﬁned by quantum
principles. As a result the interpretation of all objects which is constructed on the
base of the wave function is rather obscure, because the meaning of the wave function
itself is obscure. In the stochastic system dynamics the wave function is simply a
method of description of any nondissipative ﬂuid [3]. In this case the meaning of all
objects constructed on the base of the wave function and the meaning of the wave
function itself are obtained rather simply in terms of classical description of a ﬂuid
(continuous medium).

Connection between the ﬂuid and the Schr¨odinger equation is known since the
beginning of the quantum mechanics construction [4, 5]. In after years many au-
thors developed this interplay known as hydrodynamic interpretation of quantum
mechanics [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. But this interpretation was founded ul-
timately on the wave function as a fundamental object of dynamics. It cannot go
outside the framework of quantum principles, because the connection between the
hydrodynamic interpretation and the quantum mechanics was one-way connection.
One could obtain the irrotational ﬂuid ﬂow from the dynamic equation for the wave
function (Schr¨odinger equation), but one did not know how to transform dynamic
equations for a ﬂuid to the dynamic equation for a wave function. In other words,
we did not know how to describe rotational ﬂuid ﬂow in terms of the wave function.
In terms of the wave function we could describe only irrotational ﬂuid ﬂow.

To describe arbitrary ﬂuid ﬂow in terms of a wave function, one needs to in-
tegrate conventional dynamic equations for a ﬂuid (Euler equations). Indeed, the

2

may be reduced to the hydrodynamic equations for the variables ρ, v, describing the
ﬂuid state. Substituting ψ = √ρ exp (i~ϕ) in (1.1) and separating real and imaginary
parts of the equation, we obtain expressions for time derivatives ∂0ρ and ∂0ϕ. To
obtain expression for the time derivative ∂0v of the velocity v = ~
∇ϕ, we need to
~
diﬀerentiate dynamic equation for ∂0ϕ, forming combination ∂0v = ∇
m ∂0ϕ
. The
reverse transition from hydrodynamic equations to dynamic equations for the wave
function needs a general integration of hydrodynamic equations. This integration
is simple in the partial case of irrotational ﬂow, but it is a rather complicated
mathematical problem in the general case, when a result of integration has to contain
three arbitrary functions of three arguments. Without producing this integration
one cannot derive description of a ﬂuid in terms of the wave function, and one
cannot manipulate dynamic equations, transforming them from representation in
terms of ρ, v to representation in terms of wave function and back. This problem
has not been solved for years. It had been solved in the end of eighties, and the ﬁrst
application of this integration can be found in [15]. Systematical application of this
integration for description of quantum phenomena began in 1995 [16, 17].

seems to be hopeless. It is really so, if the Euler system (1.2), (1.3) is considered to
be a complete system of dynamic equations. In fact, the Euler equations (1.2), (1.3)
do not form a complete system of dynamic equations, because it does not describe
motion of ﬂuid particles along their trajectories. To obtain the complete system of
dynamic equations, we should add to the Euler system so called Lin constraints [18]

Seven equations (1.2) – (1.4) form the complete system of dynamic equations,
whereas four Euler equations (1.2), (1.3) form only a closed subsystem of the com-
plete system of dynamic equations. The wave function is expressed via hydrody-
, which are known also as Clebsch potentials [19, 20].

It is impossible to obtain general solution of the Euler system (1.2), (1.3), but
one can partially integrate the complete system (1.2) – (1.4), reducing its order
to four dynamic equations for the wave function (1.5). Practically it means that
one integrates dynamic equations (1.4), where the function v (t, x) is determined
implicitly by equations (1.2), (1.3). Such an integration and reduction of the order
of the complete system of dynamic equations appears to be possible, because the
system (1.2) – (1.4) has the symmetry group, connected with transformations of the

(1.6)

Being a ﬁnite function of Clebsch potentials ξ, the wave function contains informa-
tion on motion of ﬂuid particles along their trajectories. This information cannot be
obtained from the Euler equations (1.2), (1.3) without using Lin constraints (1.4).
Dependence on ξ takes place only in the case, when the wave function has more,
than one component. In the case of the Schr¨odinger equation for the spinless particle
the wave function has only one component ψ = √ρeiϕu1 (ξ), where in virtue of the
second equation (1.5) u1 (ξ) = 1, and the wave function does not depend on ξ. See
details in [21, 3].

After this integration became clear, that the wave function is only a method of
the ﬂuid description. Application of the wave function as a fundamental object of
quantum mechanics is too restrictive and its meaning is obscure, if it is determined
axiomatically by quantum principles. The meaning of the wave function becomes
clear, when it is considered to be a method of the ﬂuid description. Two possible
conceptions of the quantum phenomena are described by the following scheme

Quantum principles are foundation of the conventional quantum theory, and
axiomatic properties of the wave function form a foundation of the hydrodynamic
interpretation, i.e. the wave function is primary and hydrodynamic interpretation is
secondary. In the model description of quantum phenomena the quantum principles
are replaced by the statistical description, which is connected closely with the ﬂuid
dynamics, and ﬂuid dynamics is a basis for introduction of the wave function, i.e.
the ﬂuid dynamics is primary and the wave function is secondary.

How to determine the change (1.8)? At this stage of investigation the change
(1.8) is phenomenological. In general, the form of the change (1.8) is determined by
the properties (character) of stochasticity. But we do not know how to describe the
type of stochasticity and their properties. Then the form of change (1.8) labels the
type of stochasticity, and the change (1.8) may be considered to be a method of the
stochasticity description. Before the further discussion let us consider an example
of quantum stochasticity.

to be small with respect to c. Then we must make the change (1.12) only in the
ﬁrst term of (1.10), because the same change in the second term give the quantity

(1.13) also describes a ﬂuid, but now it is a ﬂuid with a pressure and its irrotational
ﬂow is described by the Schr¨odinger equation [22, 23].

The action (1.13) admits a simple interpretation. The derivative dx/dt describes
the mean velocity of a ﬂuid particle which does not coincide with the velocity of
stochastic particle
Sst, as well as the velocity of a gas particle does not coincide with
the velocity of a gas molecule. The gas molecule has stochastic velocity component.
Likewise, the stochastic particle
Sst has the stochastic velocity component. The
mean value of this stochastic component is described by the variable u. For a
stochastic Brownian particle the mean value of the stochastic component velocity is
described by the relation

uBr =

D∇ ln ρBr

where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and ρBr is the density of randomly wandering

Then variation of (1.17) with respect to u gives the relation (1.16). The nature of
stochastic velocities u and uBr is similar. Both velocities u and uBr are a result of
random wandering. However, dynamic equations are diﬀerent, because dissipative
Brownian particle obeys the Aristotelian dynamics, whereas conservative quantum
particle
Sst obeys the Newtonian dynamics. The state of the statistical average
is described by the variable ρBr. According to (1.15) the
Brownian particle
velocity uBr is a function of the state ρBr, and dynamic equation for the state ρBr
has the form of the continuity equation

The ﬁrst term m

2 u2 of Lst is the kinetic energy of the stochastic component. But
this term does not contain time derivative. It depends only on x. It means that it

Result (1.21) is obtained by variation of (1.19) with respect to κl in the same

The action (1.19) describes some relativistic ﬂuid, whose particles interact via

3 Connection between energy-momentum and canon-

ical momentum

It is common practice to think that in the absence of electromagnetic ﬁeld the
canonical momentum (2.8) coincides with the particle energy-momentum Pi. Then
the particle energy may be negative, as far as the canonical momentum component

11

p0 may be positive and negative. Existence of negative particle energy is very
undesirable, because it leads to many very strange corollaries.

In reality, the energy-momentum Pi, i = 0, 1, 2, 3 and canonical momentum pi,
i = 0, 1, 2, 3 are diﬀerent quantities which can coincide only in the case, when there
are only particles, or only antiparticles. They are deﬁned diﬀerently. The canonical
momentum pi is deﬁned as the quantity canonically conjugate to coordinate xi of
the particle position by means of the relation (2.8). The energy-momentum Pi is
deﬁned by the relation

Pi =

In the case, when f (q) + 1 < 0 in some regions of the space-time, the equation
(3.9) may have several roots. Each of roots corresponds to some intersection of
the world line with the plane t =const. Any of such intersections describes either
particle, when sgn( ˙q0) =
sgn(p0) > 0, or antiparticle, when sgn( ˙q0) =
sgn(p0) <
−
0. According to (3.14) the electric charge Qp of a particle is equal to

εe

−
sgn(p0). Thus, the
whereas the electric charge Qa of an antiparticle is equal to εe
·
particle and antiparticle have electric charges of diﬀerent signs, because the sign of p0
is diﬀerent for particle and antiparticle. According to (3.15) the energy is positive for
a particle as well as for an antiparticle, although the sign of the temporal component
p0 of the canonical momentum is diﬀerent for particle and antiparticle.

−

Such a situation seems to be very reasonable. It can be interpreted as follows.
Let the term ”SWL” (section of world line) means the collective concept with respect
to concepts ”particle” and ”antiparticle”. The particle and antiparticle distinguish
in the sign of the temporal component p0 of the canonical momentum and in the
gls ˙ql ˙qs
sign of the temporal component
of the velocity 4-vector. Flux of
the world lines through some spacelike three-dimensional area dSi for particles and
the ﬂux of the world lines through the same area dSi for antiparticles have diﬀerent
signs. This fact may be interpreted in the sense that a particle is one SWL, whereas
an antiparticle is minus one SWL. If SWL has the canonical momentum pi, then the
number n of SWLs is n =
sgn(p0). The relations (3.13) – (3.15) can be written in
the form

This is reasonable formulas for additive quantities, when, the additive quantity
a of several objects (SWLs) is a sum of additive quantities a of each object (SWL)
multiplied by the number n of objects (SWLs). It is unusual only that the number
n of objects (SWLs) may be negative.

4 Peculiarities of description in terms of world

lines

From viewpoint of the consistent relativity theory a world line is a real physical ob-
ject, whereas a particle and an antiparticle (SWLs) are attributes of the world line,
which appear as a result of intersection of the world line with the plane t =const.
We shall use a special term ‘WL’ for the world line, considered to be a real phys-
ical object.
In the nonrelativistic theory a real physical object is a particle (or
antiparticle), whereas the world line is an attribute of a particle (its history).

Particle and antiparticle in the nonrelativistic theory (or in inconsistent relativis-
tic theory) are two diﬀerent objects, having diﬀerent parameters. The particle is

constant. The antiparticle is described by the parameters
antiparticle are described by diﬀerent dynamic systems, because these systems have
diﬀerent parameters. Note that at such a description the component ε of orien-
tation ε is not a parameter of dynamic system.
It is a method of description of
τ of the world line parametrization.
SWL, because ε changes at the change τ
At nonrelativistic approach one cannot describe pair production classically, because
one cannot connect fragments of world lines of two diﬀerent objects (particle and
antiparticle). In the framework of classical theory consideration of a particle and an
antiparticle as two diﬀerent objects is incompatible. In the quantum theory, where
the particle world line may not exist, it is possible to introduce special operators,
describing production and annihilation of a particle (antiparticle). In quantum the-
ory pair generation is a corollary of dynamic equations, and one can imagine such a
situation (at proper choice of dynamic equations), when particles and antiparticles
are generated separately.
In the classical theory the pair generation of particles
and antiparticles is described on the deeper (descriptive) level. Choice of dynamic
equations cannot change anything.

According to (3.13), (3.14) this transformation changes neither energy-momentum

the canonical momentum for antiparticles and does not change it for particles. As
a result the temporal component p0 of particles and antiparticles becomes negative,
and one can identify the energy E of particles and antiparticles with the time com-
p0. Conventionally such an

identiﬁcation is always produced, to satisfy so called causality principle. Tempo-

where [...]− means a commutator of two operators, describing dynamic variables u
and v at points x1 and x2 respectively.

The relation (4.3) is known as the causality principle.

Interpretation of this
principle is such. Events at the points P1 and P2 are independent, because no
interaction can propagate faster, than the speed of the light.

L

If the world line

is considered to be a whole object (WL), described by dynamic
equations (2.8), (2.9) and parameter τ , changing monotonically along
, there are
points P1 and P2, separated by spacelike interval and belonging to
. Of course, it is
possible only, if there are pair production and pair annihilation. For instance, in the
example of the second section (see (2.22)) the points with coordinates P1 = (t, x)
vt1|
and P2 = (t, 2 (x0 + vt1)
.
According to (2.22) they both belong to the same world line. As far as the state
(x2, p2) of dynamic system at the point P2 is a function of its state (x1, p1) at the
point P1, the relation (4.2) cannot be fulﬁlled for all functions u and v of dynamic
variables. It means that the causality principle in the form (4.2) is violated. Events
at points P1 and P2 appear to be dependent, when the particle and antiparticle are
described as diﬀerent states of total WL (but not as separate dynamic systems).

Does it mean that the description in terms of WL is incompatible with the
causality principle? No, because description in terms of one WL is only a part of
the complete description of the particle-antiparticle collision. Indeed, let us imagine
that we prepare high energy particle and antiparticle at the points P1 and P2, sep-
arated by spacelike interval. Let these SWLs move to meet each other. Then there
are the following possibilities: (1) the particle and antiparticle annihilate (descrip-
tion in terms of one WL), (2) particle and antiparticle do not collide (description
in terms of two WLs), (3) particle and antiparticle collide and generates n pairs
additionally (description in terms of n + 1 WLs). Thus, the complete description of
particle-antiparticle collision is described statistically by means of a sum of k-WL
descriptions k = 1, 2, ... The causality principle can be applied only to the complete
description.

Description in terms of one WL is a special part of the complete description,
and this partial description may contain a correlation between the points, separated
by a spacelike interval, because the fact that the particle and antiparticle annihilate
supposes some correlation between the states at the points P1 and P2, separated by a

16

spacelike interval. This correlation for one-WL description means that not all Poison
brackets (4.2) do vanish. This correlation does not mean a violation of the causality
principle, because one-WL description does not pretend to a complete description of
the particle-antiparticle collision. The conventional description in terms of particles
and antiparticles pretend to a complete description, and fulﬁllment of the causality
principle is essential for the complete description.

Understanding that the complete description is a very complicated problem, we
divide the problem into parts (one WL, two WLs,...) and try to solve any part
separately. Our strategy of investigation reminds the investigation of interaction of
nonrelativistic particles, where the number of particles conserves. Then the whole in-
vestigation can be separated into one-particle problem, two-particle problem, three-
particle problem,...These problems are solved in series. In the relativistic case the
number of WLs is conserved, and the whole problem can be separated into parts,
corresponding to ﬁxed number of WLs. Some ideas of such an approach one can
ﬁnd in [25], but details need further development. In any case a description of the
pair production in terms of one WL does not contradict to the causality principle,
because this description does not pretend to a complete description of the collision
process.

In the modern relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory a description is produced in terms
of particles and antiparticles (but not in terms of WLs). This statement follows from
identiﬁcation of the energy operator E with the Hamilton operator H = p0 which is
deﬁned as an evolution operator. Formally this identiﬁcation follows from relations

i~∂ku = [u, Pk]− ,

Pk =

T 0
k dx,

k = 0, 1, 2, 3

(4.4)

Z

where u is an operator of arbitrary dynamic variable, [...]− denotes commutator, and
Pk is the energy-momentum operator of the dynamic system. At such a description
the causality principle is valid, because description is carried out in terms of particles
and antiparticles (but not in terms of WLs).

A diﬃculty of such an approach is a consideration of indeﬁnite number of non-
conserved objects (particles and antiparticles). This leads a perturbative description
of the pair production processes.

Conceptual defect of conventional description with a use of identiﬁcation (4.4)
is incompatibility of the relations (4.4) with the dynamic equations. Restrictions
(4.4) are compatible with dynamic equations, obtained at the canonical secondary
quantization of linear equation

~2∂i∂iψ + m2c2ψ = 0

But they stop to be compatible with dynamic equations, obtained at the canonical
secondary quantization of nonlinear equation

~2∂i∂iψ + m2c2ψ = gψ∗ψψ,

g = const

The fact is that the secondary quantization of (4.6) can be produced without
imposition of constraints (4.4). Such a quantization is produced in terms of WLs

(4.5)

(4.6)

17

[26]. It does not use the perturbation theory and admits to obtain solution of the
scattering problem without cut oﬀ at t
. If the secondary quantization can be
→ ±∞
carried out without imposition of (4.4), one should test whether the relations (4.4)
are compatible with dynamic equations. The test shows that the constraints (4.4)
are compatible with the dynamic equations only for linear equation (4.5), but they
are incompatible with (4.6) [26]. After imposition of constraints (4.4) the problem
becomes overdetermined. The overdetermined problem is inconsistent, and one can
obtain practically any desired result for such a statement of the problem.

It is quite reasonable that the causality principle (4.3) is not fulﬁlled at the
quantization in terms of WLs, because it is a corollary of the constraints (4.4). Sec-
ondary quantization in terms WLs [26] does not describe pair production. It does
not describe even scattering of a particle on antiparticle. But at the same time this
quantization is consistent and well deﬁned from the formal viewpoint. What does it
mean? It means only that the nonlinear self-action term in (4.6) does not describe
pair production, because the pair production is apparently a more subtle eﬀect.
But why conventionally at quantization [27, 28, 29, 30] of (4.6) one obtains pair
production? The answer is simple. Because of overdetermination of the problem,
that makes the problem inconsistent. Practically, it looks as follows.
Imposition
of the constraint (4.6) leads to fragmentation of the total world line into particles
and antiparticles. After scattering one needs to produce defragmentation and col-
lect fragments into the total world lines. Process of defragmentation is imperfect,
because of inconsistent perturbative description. Reminders of imperfect defragmen-
tation imitate pair production. At the conventional approach any nonlinear term
leads to pair production, whereas classical description of the second section shows
that the ﬁeld, producing pairs must have rather speciﬁc properties.

Failure of the paper [26] in description of pair production and inconsistency
of conventional quantization in terms of particles and antiparticles show that one
needs to investigate properties of the κ-ﬁeld, producing pairs, more carefully, trying
to understand what factor is responsible for pair production.

Trying to interpret dynamic system
shall use only dynamic considerations. This means that
SKG is considered to be a
ﬂuid, and world lines of the ﬂuid particles are interpreted as average world lines of
stochastic particles. We consider
SKG as a ﬂuid and interpret its motion in terms
of hydrodynamics. We ignore interpretation, based on quantum principles, because
this interpretation in terms of the wave function is purely empirical. It has been
tested only for nonrelativistic quantum phenomena. In the relativistic case there
are problems for interpretation of expressions constructed on the basis of the wave
function.

24

From viewpoint of hydrodynamic interpretation the wave function is only a very
SKG. This method is very convenient for solution
special method of description of
of dynamic equations, because they are linear in terms of wave function, but it is
not the best method for interpretation of the ﬂuid motion.

We shall interpret dynamic system, following the behaviour of such physical
quantities as the current ji and the energy-momentum tensor T ik. The energy-
momentum tensor for
SKG is obtained by means of relation (3.2). Applying the
relation (3.2) to the action (6.1) – (6.3) and taking into account that the Lagrangian

negative. Thus, the state ψP describes a ﬂuid, consisting of a cloud of NP SWLs,
moving with velocity v = p/E (p) + O (∆). The pressure in the ﬂuid is small (of the
order O (∆)), and one can speak on freely moving SWLs (particles or antiparticles).
From viewpoint of quantum principles the state ψ{1,p} (for particles) is inter-
preted similarly. But for interpretation of the state ψ{−1,p} (for antiparticles) there

28

are problems [31], connected with negative value of the quantity EP /NP (energy per
SWL).

Now let us consider the state ψ = ψ{1,p} + ψ{1,−p}. In the conventional quantum
mechanics the wave function is a fundamental object of theory. The wave functions
ψ{1,p} and ψ{1,−p} evolve independently and this fact is interpreted in the sense
that the particles described by ψ{1,p} and the particles described by ψ{1,−p} do not
interact. Thus, from viewpoint of quantum principles the state ψ describes two
clouds of particles, moving with velocities v and
v one through another without
interaction.

From hydrodynamic viewpoint the state ψ = ψ{1,p} + ψ{1,−p} describes rather
complicated picture of two colliding clouds of particles. According to the hydrody-

Let us consider the state ψ = ψ{εp,p} + ψ{−εp,p}. From viewpoint of quantum
principles the state ψ describes a cloud of particles and a cloud of antiparticles,

From viewpoint of hydrodynamic interpretation the state ψ{1,p} + ψ{−1,p} de-
scribes a complicated picture of interacting particles and antiparticles. In the process
of interaction the pair production and the pair annihilation take place. The process

antiparticles escaping one from another, as if they have passed one through another

Our investigation of solutions of the free Klein-Gordon equation is a preliminary
consideration, which is necessary for correct mathematical formulation of the colli-
sion problem of the problem pair production as a special case of the collision prob-
lem. Two diﬀerent interpretations of the states ψ{εp,p} + ψ{εp,−p} and ψ{1,p} + ψ{−1,p}
generate two diﬀerent statements of the collision problem. The conventional inter-
pretation based on the wave function as a fundamental object of dynamics leads
to the S-matrix theory, where detailed description of dynamic processes inside the
collision space-time region is supposed to be impossible. For solution of these The
energy-momentum conservation law is used mainly. Alternative approach based on
sequential consideration of ﬂuid dynamics and hydrodynamic quantities leads to
another statement of the collision problem. Comparison of these two diﬀerent state-
ments of the collision problem is possible only at the detailed presentation of the
alternative statement of the collision problem. Unfortunately, such a presentation
cannot be made in the present paper.

We restrict our consideration to the problem of two elastic balls collision, which
reminds to some extent the collision problem of the microparticle collision. At the
head-on collision of two identical elastic balls they interchange their momenta, and
the whole situation may be described as one ball passes through another one without
interaction. It is a very simple interpretation, but it is not eﬀective, because it can
be used only for head-on collision.
If the impact parameter does not vanish, or
the balls are not identical, we are forced to introduce interaction between the balls.

30

If we assume that the identical balls do not interact at the head-on collision, it is
rather diﬃcult to understand, why they begin to interact with non-vanishing impact
parameter. One needs to invent a special interaction for explanation of non-head-on
collision. Is it possible to construct such a theory of two balls collision, which is
based on the supposition that the balls do not interact at the head-on collision?
Yes it is possible, but such a theory is founded mainly on the energy-momentum
conservation law, and it does not ﬁt for explanation of inelastic collisions, where
detailed investigation of interaction between the balls is necessary.

The approach, when the head-on collision of two identical elastic balls is con-
sidered to be a strong interaction of two balls, which leads to an interchange of
momenta, seems to be more reasonable, because it explains freely, why result of
collision is not reduced to the interchange of momenta at the collision with non-
vanishing impact parameter. At such an approach the interchange of momenta is
explained by balanced interaction at the head-on collision. If the impact parameter
does not vanish, this balance is violated. Although explanation of the balanced
interaction is more complicated, but application of this interaction to the case of
unbalanced interaction appears to be simpler. Something like this we have in the
case of two alternative approaches to the microparticle collision problem.

8 Concluding remarks

Thus, quantum system is a special case of stochastic system, and quantum phenom-
ena can be considered to be a result of some quantum stochasticity, generated by
the space-time properties [1]. Pair production is a natural result of the sequential
relativistic description of this stochasticity. The statistical description of quantum
phenomena generates hydrodynamic interpretation of quantum phenomena, which
does not coincide, in general, with the interpretation, based on application of quan-
tum principles, and the interpretation appears to be essential for statement of the
microparticle collision problem.

In consequence of long-term (2000) observation of a sys-
tem of two high-precision quartz gravimeters (one of them
with an attached magnet) placed in a special (at a depth of
∼10m) gravimetric laboratory on a common base separated
from the foundation of the building, signals of a new nature
were detected. They were of a smooth peak-type shape, sev-
eral minutes duration, and with amplitudes often more than
that of the moon tide.

The nature of the signals cannot be explained in the frame-
work of traditional physical views but can be qualitatively de-
scribed with the aid of a supposed new interaction connected
with the hypothesis about the existence of the cosmological
vectorial potential Ag, a new presumed fundamental vectorial
constant.

I. INTRODUCTION.

The signal of a new nature were ﬁrst detected in a run
of experiments of 1994-1996, carried out with the aid of
a modernized high-precision quartz gravimeter “Sodin”
and a magnet attached to it [1-4]. The signal appeared
as permanent smooth peak-shape pulses with duration
from 2 to 10min. and with amplitudes up to ∼ 15L (L is
the amplitude of the moon tide). The experiments were
carried out within a special box of the gravimetric labo-
ratory of SSAI MSU, in a basement room at a level of 2
meters underground. The duration of the uninterrupted
experiment was no more than 30 days. Besides the last
peak (19.04.96), all results were obtained on the basis
of one gravimeter measurements. In the last experiment
two gravimeters were used. They were positioned on the
same base in the box: one of the them was with a mag-
net, the other (reference one) was without magnet. Both
gravimeters were connected to the same power network
but had separated stabilized power sources.

In the experiment with two gravimeters, that with
magnet detected an anomalous event which was not ﬁxed
by the gravimeter without magnet.

Since the procedure of investigating the signal of new
nature with the aid of two gravimeters was of short-term
duration (and the main results were obtained by one
gravimeter), the run of experiments in 1994-1996 could
be considered only as preliminary one. Nontheless, it
should be noted that the signals (12 peaks) were con-
centrated in space around some stellar direction having
the following coordinates in the second equatorial sys-
tem: right ascension α ≈ 270◦ , declination δ ≈ 34◦.
This was nearly coincident with some chosen spatial di-
rection found in the course of investigating the assumed
new anisotropic interaction with the aid of a torsion bal-
ance arranged inside high-current magnets [3-8] as well
as when observing time changes in the intensity of the
β-decay of radioactive elements [3,4,9-10] in the process
of their rotation together with the Earth.

The new run of experiments was aimed at more precise
measurements owing to elimination of technique errors of
the preceding investigations.

II. THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND
PROCEDURE.

In the run of experiments of 1999-2000, the method of
two gravimeters with a magnet attached to one of them,
was used. The gravimeters were positioned in an under-
ground gravimetric laboratory of SSAI MSU, at a depth
of ∼ 10m, on a special base separated from the founda-
tion of the building. A recently made stabilized power
system could feed the gravimeters also in a case of ac-
cidental power switching oﬀ during ∼ 2hs. The infor-
mation from gravimeters was transmitted to a personal
computers (PC).

A schematic diagram of a quartz sensitive system is
shown in Fig.1.
Its main component is a quartz lever
1 (2 cm in length with a platinum mass of m = 0.05g)
suspended on torsion quartz ﬁbres 2 and additionally oﬀ-
loaded by a vertical quartz spring 3. Such a construction
gives to the device the high sensitivity to changes in grav-
ity up to 1µGal (10−8ms−2 = 10−9G, G is the free fall
acceleration) as well as suﬃcient protection against mi-
croseismic disturbances.

The optical recording system comprises a galogen lamp
4 fed from a high-stabilised power source, light of which

lamp enters into the instrument through the objective
lens 5 with the aid of optical ﬁbers. The quartz rod
6 welded to the level is a cylindrical lens, it forms an
image of the point light source, which falls further on a
photosensor rule 7 with a sensitivity on the order of 1µm.
The digital signal from the photosensor rule output en-
ters further through a special interface to a computer PC
which executes preliminary processing and averaging of
data over the interval of 1 min. The accuracy of minute’s
data is (0.5−1.2)×10−9G depending on the microseismic
noise level varying considerably in the course of day.

The sensitive system of the instrument includes some
additional units (not shown in Fig.1) protecting it from
thermal, electrostatic, and atmospheric pressure distur-
bances.

Calibration of the instrument is carried out by the in-
clination procedure with an accuracy of about (0.5 −
1.0)% which is quite suﬃcient for the experiment being
considered.

The amplitude of constantly recorded by the device
changes in gravity due to Moon-Sun tides and corre-
is (50 − 200) × 10−9G
sponding Earth’s deformation,
which allows to evaluate magnitudes of possible anoma-
lous eﬀects against the background of tides.

To measure the new interaction by the Sodin gravime-
ter, a constant magnet (60 mm in diameter, 15mm in
height, the ﬁeld B in the centre of 0.3T ) was attached to
it in such a way that the vector potential lines of the mag-
net in the vicinity of a test platinum weight (see Fig.1)
were directed perpendicular to the Earth’s surface. The
magnet played the role of a peculiar ampliﬁer of the new
force (see in detail Refs. [3,4]).

III. RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS.

To illustrate the experiment, in Figs.2-6 some tempo-
ral fragments of recording of the gravimeters are shown.
They demonstrate smooth peak-form overshoots by the
“Sodin” gravimeter S209 with the attached constant
magnet.

At the ﬁrst stage of experiments, the gravimeter with
the magnet and the reference gravimeter worked on dif-
ferent time scales (Moscow (MSK) and Greenwich (UTC)
time, respectively). Therefore a shift of the curves is seen
in Figs.2,3 which corresponds to that of time zones (i.e.
3hs).

It is seen from the Figures that the amplitudes of over-
shoots are in some cases (Figs.4,5) much superior to the
In February-March 2000,
amplitude of the moon tide.
the overshoots corresponded to an increase in the grav-
itational eﬀect, in May-June on the contrary to its de-
crease.

As opposed to the experiments of 1994-1996 in which
the duration of the peaks was various (from 2 to 10 min.
and more), the peak length in consideration was practi-
cally constant and equaled 2-3 min.

In Table 1 presented are all anomalous deﬂections
recorded by the gravimeter with magnet and not ﬁxed
by the reference gravimeter without magnet.

Consider in detail an experimental fragment shown in
Fig.6. As is seen, the events 1,3,4 corresponding to local
earthquakes are neatly coincident in the recordings of
both gravimeters, but the event 2 was ﬁxed only by the
gravimeter with magnet.

IV. DISCUSSION.

As was said above, the instruments in the course of the
experiment were arranged on the base separated from
the foundation of the building, at a depth of ∼ 10m.
Therefore, as is clearly seen from Fig.6, various Earth’s
oscillations acted identically onto both gravimeters.

Their design gives them good protection against ther-
mal, electrostatic, and barometric disturbances. The
gravimeters were powered from the same network, there-
fore, if some disturbance of “unknown nature”1 could
pass through it that would manifest itself in both read-
ings. The possible “jumps” in quartz occurring some-
times when using the gravimeters “Sodin” have quite dif-
ferent form and cannot explain the nature of the smooth
minute’s peaks ﬁxed in the experiment. The result ob-
tained also cannot be explained by noise in the com-
puters, because during the long use of them before the
run of experiments of 1994-1996 as well as in other ex-
periments carried out in 2001, such peaks were not ob-
served. The outer electromagnetic noise was practically
minimum and, which is the main, that would uniformly
tell on both gravimeters.

One cannot also explain the obtained results by the
inﬂuence on the gravimeter of various hypothetical parti-
cles predicted in modern calibration theories (like axions,
photinos, gravitinos, etc.) [11,12] since both gravimeters
are equal for their properties.

A temporal analysis of peak’s appearance in readings
of the gravimeter in association with the solar activity
has shown the following (See Table 1).

In Table 1 shown are the times of detection of the
peaks by the gravimeter with magnet during the ﬁrst
half-year 2000 as well as times of corresponding events in
the Sun with indication of character of the event and the
observatory from which the information was obtained.
The more complete information about the solar events
accompanying the peaks can be found in Refs. [13].

As is seen from Table 1, the peak detected 24.03.2000
by the gravimeter with magnet coincides practically pre-
cisely with a sweep-frequency radio burst.

1 The electric power supply of the instrumentation was sta-
bilized, so that there was no problem with it and it was not
switched oﬀ.

The event (2) in Fig.6 occurred 5 minutes before a
potent solar ﬂare. The ﬂares of such potency were not
observed earlier during more than 40 years.

The other events ﬁxed by the gravimeter lie several
minutes or tens of minutes earlier or later than solar
events of ordinary importance.

The results obtained can be qualitatively explained
with the help of assumed new interaction caused by the
existence of the vector Ag.

According to recent investigations of anisotropic prop-
erties of the new force presented in Ref.[14], this force
is directed at each point of space over a cone with the
opening of 90 − 100◦ formed around the vector Ag with
the coordinates α ≈ 293◦±10◦; δ ≈ 36◦±10◦. The results
of [14] are in good agreement with [15].

The force can act also in direction of Ag if an object
being acted upon has a closed circular current. This was
observed in experiments on investigating changes in the
intensity of β-decay of radioactive elements [15].

An analysis of the experimental material presented
here has shown that all events in Table 1 (except (2) in
Fig.6) corresponded to such observation time when the
direction of a normal to the surface of the Earth (i.e. the
direction of the maximum sensitivity of the gravimeters)
was coincident (to a precision of ±10◦) with the gener-
ator of above said cone. The time of the event (2) in
Fig.6 indicates the direction of the normal to the Earth’s
surface coincident (to ±5◦) with the coordinates of the
vector Ag itself: α = 293◦, δ = 36◦ (i.e. with the axis of
the cone).

It was shown in Ref.[16] that the observed anisotropy of
solar ﬂares reveals a very similar direction (α = 277◦±5◦,
δ = 38◦ ± 5◦) which can be explained on the basis of the
new anisotropic interaction.

Thus the experiments carried out with the use of two
gravimeters have conﬁrmed the earlier results obtained
with the aid of only one gravimeter with an attached
magnet. Their results (the direction of the new force) are
coincident with those of the experiments on investigating
the anisotropic properties of space with the aid of plasma
generators as well as the changes in intensity of the β-
decay of radioactive elements.

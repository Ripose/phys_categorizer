THE BLACK HOLES DO NOT EXIST
“ALSO SPRACH KARL SCHWARZSCHILD”

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. According to the original theoretical analysis of 1916 by
Karl Schwarzschild the black holes do not have a physical reality.

A paper “f¨ur Alle und Keinen”.

Introduction

I recall here the main stages of an important theoretical acquisition, which
was originated by a fundamental memoir of 1916 by Karl Schwarzschild, i.e.:
the general theory of relativity (GR) does not allow the physical existence
of black holes (BH’s) – if rightly understood.

From the observational standpoint the alleged discoveries of BH’s are
mere ﬂatus vocis:
in reality, the astronomical observations prove only the
presence of very large – or enormously large – masses concentrated in very
small (“punctual”) volumes.

1916

In this year Schwarzschild published two epochal memoirs, respectively
entitled “ ¨Uber das Gravitationsfeld eines Massenpunktes nach der EIN-
STEINschen Theorie” [1], and “ ¨Uber das Gravitationsfeld einer Kugel aus
inkompressibler Fl¨ussigkeit nach der EINSTEINschen Theorie” [2]. In the
ﬁrst paper the Author gives the exact solution of the problem of the Ein-
steinian gravitational ﬁeld which is generated by a point mass M at rest. If
r, ϑ, ϕ are spherical polar co-ordinates, we have the following expression for
the spacetime interval ds:

where m ≡ GM/c2; G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of

light in vacuo; R ≡ [r3 + (2m)3]1/3.

This ds2 holds, physically and mathematically, in the entire spacetime,
with the only exception of the origin r = 0, seat of the mass M . (Remark
that this singular point has an associate superﬁcial area equal to 4π(2m)2:
this means simply that the Einsteinian material point is not identical with
the Newtonian material point, as it was emphasized in 1923 by Marcel Bril-
louin [3].)

In the second paper [2] Schwarzschild determined the Einsteinian gra-
vitational ﬁeld generated by an incompressible ﬂuid sphere. Now, if one
computes the limit of this solution when the sphere contracts into a ma-
terial point of a ﬁnite mass M , one ﬁnds anew the Schwarzschildian form
of solution for a mass point of the ﬁrst memoir (see A. Loinger, arXiv:gr-
qc/9908009, August 3rd, 1999). It is very interesting that a ﬂuid sphere of
uniform density and given mass cannot have a radius smaller than (9/8)(2m).

1916-1917

If in lieu of the R of eq.(1) we put simply the radial co-ordinate r, we
obtain the so-called standard form of the solution of the problem solved
in [1] (Schwarzschild problem). This form was discovered independently
It is usually, but erroneously,
by Hilbert [4], Droste [4], and Weyl [6].
named “by Schwarzschild”. The HDW-form is physically valid only for r >
2m, because within the spatial surface r = 2m (a singular locus) the time
co-ordinate takes the role of the radial co-ordinate, and vice versa (and
therefore ds2 loses its essential property of physical appropriateness) and
the solution becomes non-static. Quite properly, Nathan Rosen emphasized
repeatedly that the radial co-ordinate of the HDW-form has been initially
chosen in such a way that the area of the space surface r = k is equal to
4πk2: consequently, it is very diﬃcult to admit that the co-ordinate r can
transform itself into the time co-ordinate within the space region r < 2m.

Finally, it is very easy to prove that in the manifold deﬁned by HDW-
form for 0 < r < ∞ it is impossible to assign the time arrow to every time
geodesic, according to physically reasonable criteria; on the contrary, this
diﬃculty does not exist for the Schwarzschild form (1), [7].

The ﬁctive notion of BH was generated by erroneous reﬂections on the
“globe” r = 2m of the standard HDW-form. It would not have come forth
if the treatises of GR had expounded the Schwarzschild form of solution in
lieu of the standard form.

Remark that the validity restriction r > 2m of the standard form does
not imply a physical limitation. Indeed, as all the classic Authors knew, the
exterior part r > 2m of the HDW-form is diﬀeomorphic to the Schwarzschild
form, which holds for r > 0.

1922-1923-1924

As far back as 1922 all the competent scientists knew the right interpre-
tation of the standard HDW-form. Indeed, in 1922 a meeting was held at
the Coll`ege de France, which was attended by Einstein. The physical mea-
ning of the “globe” r = 2m was discussed and deﬁnitively clariﬁed – see
the lucid paper by M. Brillouin quoted in [3]. This Author investigated also
another interesting form of solution to Schwarzschild problem, which can
be formally obtained by putting in eq.(1) the simple expression r + 2m in
lieu of R. The validity domain of Brillouin’s form is identical with that of
Schwarzschild’s form. Moreover, Brillouin shows that it is not permitted to
extend the radial co-ordinate r of Schwarzschild’s and Brillouin’s forms to

THE BLACK HOLES DO NOT EXIST - “ALSO SPRACH KARL SCHWARZSCHILD” 3

the negative values of the interval −2m < r < 0, and proves simultaneously
that the attribution of a physical meaning to the interval 0 < r < 2m of the
standard HDW-form (as the inventors of the BH’s do) is pure nonsense.

In 1924 Eddington published the second edition of his splendid treatise
on Relativity (reprinted in 1930, 1937, 1952, 1954, 1957, 1960), in which we
ﬁnd a very general form of solution to Schwarzschild problem [8]:

where f (r) in any regular function of r; we see immediately that:
f (r) ≡ R, we have the Schwarzschild form (1); if f (r) ≡ r, we have the
standard HDW-form; if f (r) ≡ r + 2m, we have the Brillouin form; etc.

All the physical results are independent of the particular choice of the

function f (r).

Quite similar considerations can be made for the gravitational ﬁelds ge-

nerated by electrically charged particles.

The years post 1924

The previous conception can be easily generalized to the gravitational

ﬁeld generated by the spinning particle of the well-known Kerr’s solution.

In regard to the “maximally extended” form of solution to Schwarzschild
problem due to Kruskal [9] and Szekeres [10] – a rather baroque form –,
we can declare its physical superﬂuity, because already the (static) forms of
Schwarzschild and Brillouin, in particular, are “maximally extended”.

Continued gravitational collapse:

it is almost evident that if we bear in
mind, e.g., Schwarzschild’s and Broillouin’s forms, no continued collapse can
generate a BH – and this was just Einstein’s opinion [11].

Since 1998 I have published several articles on arXiv in which the non-
existence of the BH’s has been demonstrated anew. The papers of the years
1998 ÷ 2001 have been collected in a book [12]; papers of the successive
years on the same subject have been published (on arXiv and) on Spacetime
and Substance.

I was motivated by a simple consideration: all the Great Spirits who
founded and developed GR thought that the notion of BH belongs to science
ﬁction [13].

APPENDIX

Observations made by a team of astrophysicists of the Max-Planck-Institut
for Extraterrestrial Physics have allowed to determine the positions of the
star denote with the symbol S2 in its motion around the Milky-Way’s centre
[14]. It has come out that the S2-orbit is a Keplerian ellipse with a period
of 15.2 years.

The accuracy of the above research seems indisputable, but the conclusion
of the authors – according to which the centre around which S2 revolves is
a black hole – seems fully unjustiﬁed. Indeed, the existence of the observed

4

Keplerian orbit can only explain the presence of a “punctual” supermassive
body at the centre of the Milky-Way – and not of a supermassive BH [15].
It can be also demonstrated that the two supermassive celestial bodies
at the centre of the distant galaxy NGC 6240 (see NASA Press Release,
November 20th, 2002) cannot be black holes [15].

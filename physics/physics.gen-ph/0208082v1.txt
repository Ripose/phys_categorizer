moving dielectric medium in a geostationary interferometer. These experiments together
then provide a support for the local-ether wave equation. Meanwhile, some other phenomena
are predicted, which provide a means to test its validity.

1. Introduction

Recently, we have presented the local-ether model of wave propagation whereby electro-
magnetic wave is supposed to propagate via a medium like the ether [1]. However, the ether
is not universal. Speciﬁcally, it is proposed that in the region under suﬃcient inﬂuence of the
gravity due to the Earth, the Sun, or another celestial body, there forms a local ether which
in turn moves with the gravitational potential of the respective body. Thereby, each local
ether together with the gravitational potential moves with the associated celestial body.
Thus, as well as earth’s gravitational potential, the earth local ether for earthbound prop-
agation is stationary in an ECI (earth-centered inertial) frame. Consequently, earthbound
wave phenomena can depend on earth’s rotation but are entirely independent of earth’s or-
bital motion around the Sun or whatever. Meanwhile, the sun local ether for interplanetary
propagation is stationary in a heliocentric inertial frame. This local-ether model has been
adopted to account for the eﬀects of earth’s motions in a wide variety of propagation phe-
nomena, particularly the Sagnac correction in GPS (global positioning system), the Sagnac
eﬀect in rotating-loop interferometers, the time comparison via intercontinental microwave
link, and the echo time in interplanetary radar. As examined within the present accuracy,
the local-ether model is still in accord with the Michelson-Morley experiment which is known
to make the classical ether notion obsolete. Moreover, by modifying the speed of light in
a gravitational potential, this simple propagation model leads to the deﬂection of light by
the Sun and the increment of echo time in the interplanetary radar which are important
phenomena supporting the general theory of relativity [1].

Further, it is noticed that the electric current generating the magnetic ﬁeld is commonly
electrically neutralized. That is, the mobile charged particles which form the current are
actually drifting in a matrix and the ions which constitute the matrix tend to electrically
neutralize the mobile particles, such as electrons in a metal wire. Thus the velocity which
determines the current density is the drift velocity of the mobile particles with respect to
the neutralizing matrix. Consequently, the neutralized current density remains unchanged
when observed in diﬀerent reference frames. In order to comply with the local-ether prop-
agation model and the frame-independence of the current density, we have developed an
electromagnetic force law which complies with Galilean transformations while it can reduce
to a familiar form under some common condition [2]. In this new classical theory all of the
involved position vectors, time derivatives, and velocities are referred speciﬁcally to their

1

respective reference frames. Owing to this simple feature, the associated potentials and elec-
tromagnetic force remain unchanged when observed in diﬀerent frames. Under the common
low-speed condition where the source particles forming the current drift very slowly with
respect to the neutralizing matrix, this force law reduces to a form similar to the Lorentz
force law. However, the fundamental modiﬁcation is that the current density generating the
magnetic ﬁeld, the time derivative applied to the magnetic vector potential in the electric
induction force, and the particle velocity connecting to the magnetic ﬁeld in the magnetic
force are all referred speciﬁcally to the matrix frame in which the matrix is stationary. The
modiﬁed equation is identical to the Lorentz force law, if the latter is observed in the matrix
frame as done tacitly in common practice.

The propagation of the electromagnetic potentials is supposed to follow the local-ether
model. Accordingly, the wave equations of potentials are derived in this investigation.
Further, based on the modiﬁed Lorentz force law and the associated deﬁnitions of electric and
magnetic ﬁelds in terms of the potentials, the local-ether wave equations of ﬁelds are derived.
Thereby, the phase speed and propagation constant of the electromagnetic wave propagating
in a moving medium are explored. Then, after the Sagnac eﬀect due to the movement of
the propagation path is taken into consideration, we present consistent reinterpretations
for some precision interferometry experiments, including the ﬁber-link experiment with a
geostationary setup and a geostationary optical ﬁber, the Sagnac rotating-loop experiments
with a comoving or a geostationary dielectric medium, and Fizeau’s experiment with a
geostationary interferometer and a moving dielectric medium.

2. Modiﬁed Lorentz Force Law

Based on Galilean transformations, we have presented an electromagnetic force law
expressed in terms of the augmented scalar potential, which is the electric scalar potential
enhanced slightly with a term associated with the diﬀerence between the velocities of the
eﬀector and the source particles [2]. Consider the electromagnetic force exerted on an eﬀector
particle of charge q due to an ensemble of source particles of charge density ρv drifting in a
matrix of charge density ρm. The drift velocity of the mobile source particles with respect
to the matrix is given by the diﬀerence vsm = vs − vm, where vs and vm are the velocities
of the source particles and the matrix, respectively, both with respect to a particular frame.
The matrix can be a metal wire, a dielectric medium, or a magnet and tends to electrically
neutralize the mobile source particles to some extent.

Under the common low-speed condition where the speeds of the involved particles are
low and the source particles drift very slowly with respect to the matrix, the electromagnetic
force law proposed in terms of the augmented potentials has been shown to reduce to the
modiﬁed Lorentz force law [2]

F(r, t) = q {E(r, t) + vem × B(r, t)} ,

where the velocity diﬀerence vem (= ve − vm) is the velocity of the eﬀector particle with
respect to the matrix and ve is the eﬀector velocity with respect to the aforementioned
particular frame. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds in turn are deﬁned explicitly in terms of
the potentials Φ and A as

and

E(r, t) = −∇Φ(r, t) −

A(r, t)

∂
∂t

(cid:18)

(cid:19)m

B(r, t) = ∇ × A(r, t),

where the time derivative (∂/∂t)m is referred speciﬁcally to the matrix frame. Quanti-
tatively, the electric scalar potential Φ and the magnetic vector potential A are deﬁned
explicitly as

(1)

(2)

(4)

Φ(r, t) =

and

A(r, t) =

,

(5)

where the net charge density ρn = ρv + ρm, the neutralized current density Jn = vsmρv, the
propagation range R = |r − r′|, and the position vectors r and r′ are referred to a particular
frame.

Obviously, the values of the neutralized current density and the potentials remain un-
changed when observed in diﬀerent frames. Moreover, since the time derivative in the
deﬁnition of ﬁeld E and the eﬀector velocity in the force law are referred uniquely to the
matrix frame, the values of ﬁelds E and B and hence the electromagnetic force exerted
on a charged particle given in the preceding formulas also remain unchanged in diﬀerent
frames. That is, based on Galilean transformations, the values of potentials, ﬁelds, and
electromagnetic force are independent of reference frame. Further, it is noted that the drift
velocity vsm involved in the neutralized current density is a Newtonian relative velocity
and hence this current density complies with Galilean relativity. For quasi-static case where
the propagation time R/c in the potentials can be neglected, the potentials Φ and A then
comply also with Galilean relativity and comove with the matrix.

It is seen that the force law (1) looks like the Lorentz force law. However, the funda-
mental modiﬁcation is that the current density generating the magnetic vector potential,
the time derivative applied to this potential in the electric induction force, and the particle
velocity connecting to the curl of this potential in the magnetic force are all referred specif-
ically to the matrix frame. Meanwhile, in applying the Lorentz force law to the analysis
of, say, a motor or the magnetic deﬂection, the adopted reference frame is usually the one
with respect to which the magnetic ﬁeld and the magnet are stationary. Thus the matrix
frame has been adopted tacitly as the reference frame. Therefore, the modiﬁed equation
is identical to the Lorentz force law, if the latter is observed in the matrix frame as done
tacitly in common practice.

3. Local-Ether Wave Equations of Potentials and Fields

Based on the local-ether model of wave propagation and the electromagnetic force in
terms of the potentials, it is supposed here that each individual source particle continuously
excites the electric scalar potential and hence other local-ether potentials. These potentials
in turn propagate radially outward from the source position at an isotropic speed c with
respect to the associated local-ether frame, independent of the motions of source and eﬀector.
That is, the position vectors r and r′ and hence the propagation range R in the potentials Φ
and A deﬁned in (4) and (5) are referred speciﬁcally to the local-ether frame and the ratio
R/c represents the propagation time from the source point r′ at the instant t′ (= t − R/c) of
wave emission to the ﬁeld point r at the instant t. To comply with the frame of the position
vectors, the velocities ve, vs, and vm are also referred to the local-ether frame.

By applying the Laplacian operator to both sides of the integral formulas for potentials
(4) and (5) and then expanding the Laplacians of the time-dependent charge and current
densities divided by R [3], it can be shown that the wave equations of these local-ether
potentials are given by

where µ0 = 1/ǫ0c2 and the position vector r together with the time derivative ∂/∂t is
referred to the local-ether frame, the reference frame of the wave propagation.

Then, by manipulating the wave equations of potentials according to the deﬁnitions of
ﬁelds, the wave equations of ﬁelds can be derived. By so doing, we have the local-ether wave

(cid:18)

where, again, the position vector r together with the time derivative ∂/∂t is referred to the
local-ether frame. It is noted that in the preceding equation the time derivative applied to
the current density is referred to the matrix frame and the velocity of the mobile source
particles forming this current density is also referred to this frame. In free space having no
sources, the local-ether wave equations take a simpler form of

c2

∂2
∂t2 Ψ(r, t) = 0,

where Ψ denotes the scalar potential Φ or any Cartesian component of the vector potential
A, electric ﬁeld E, or magnetic ﬁeld B. It is seen that both electric and magnetic ﬁelds as
well as the potentials propagate at the speed c with respect to the local-ether frame. These
local-ether wave equations made their debut in [4].

Consider the case of wave propagation in a uniform magnetic medium of permeability
µ, where Jn = ∇ × M for the magnetization current and the magnetization vector M =
(1/µ0 − 1/µ)B. Thereby, the wave equation of magnetic ﬁeld becomes

∇2B(r, t) −

∂2
∂t2 B(r, t) = 0,

where we have made use of the relation ∇·B = 0, which in turn is a consequence of (3). It is
seen that in a uniform magnetic medium of µ, electromagnetic wave propagates at the speed
µ0/µ with respect to the local-ether frame. In the preceding derivation, no information
c
about the motion of the magnetic medium is involved. Thus the derived propagation speed
p
is independent of the motion of a uniform magnetic medium.

Consider the analogous case of wave propagation in a dielectric medium of permittivity

ǫ, where

Jn(r, t) =

P(r, t)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)m

for the polarization current and the polarization vector P = (ǫ − ǫ0)E. Note that the
polarization current density is associated with the time derivative of the polarization vector
with respect to the matrix frame, since the displacement of the polarization charge under
the inﬂuence of electric ﬁeld is relative to the ions forming the matrix and the drift velocity
vsm of the source particles forming a neutralized current is also referred to the matrix frame.
Another consequence pertinent to this drift velocity is that the conservation of charge leads
to another relation between Jn and ρv of

This relation is just the continuity equation, except that the time derivative applied to
the charge density is referred speciﬁcally to the matrix frame. Further, this matrix-frame
continuity equation can be given in terms of the net charge density as

This is owing to the fact that the matrix charge density ρm is time-independent in the
matrix frame. The preceding continuity equation leads to a relation between the polarization
charge density and the polarization vector as ρn = −∇ · P, where we have made use of
the initial condition that a uniform polarization (∇ · P = 0) corresponds to the complete
neutralization (ρn = 0). Thereby, by using electric ﬁeld to express the net charge density
and the neutralized current density induced in a dielectric medium, the wave equation of
electric ﬁeld becomes

It is noted that this wave equation involves two time derivatives of electric ﬁeld referred to
diﬀerent frames.

Remark that based on Galilean transformations, the time derivatives of an arbitrary
function f of space and time with respect to the matrix and the local-ether frames are
related by

(16)

where the time derivatives ∂/∂t and (∂/∂t)m are understood to be taken under constant
r and (r − vmt), respectively, as the position vector r is referred to the local-ether frame.
Further, from the preceding relation, the second-order time derivative in the matrix frame
can be given in terms of the derivatives in the local-ether frame as

The Galilean formulas (16) and (17) have been given in [5] and [6], respectively.

Then, by using the Galilean formula (17), the wave equation of electric ﬁeld can be

rewritten as

It is noted that this wave equation of electric ﬁeld involves the matrix velocity with respect
to the local-ether frame. This feature is quite diﬀerent from that in the wave equation
of magnetic ﬁeld (11). Physically, this diﬀerence is due to the situation that polarization
current is associated with the matrix-frame time derivative of ﬁeld, while magnetization
current is with a space derivative. In terms of the matrix-frame time derivatives, the local-
ether wave equation of electric ﬁeld can be rewritten as

where the second-order term of the normalized speed vm/c is ignored. It is seen that the
last term in the preceding matrix-frame wave equation is smaller in magnitude than the
other terms by a factor of the order of the normalized speed vm/c.

Consider the simpler case where a z-polarized uniform plane wave propagates along the
x direction in a uniform dielectric medium. The medium is moving at a velocity vf with
respect to a laboratory frame which in turn is moving at a velocity v0 with respect to the
local-ether frame. Based on Galilean transformations, the matrix velocity with respect to
the local-ether frame is simply vm = vf + v0. Then, to the ﬁrst order of normalized speed,
the wave equation (18) can be simpliﬁed to a form of

where vmx = vm · ˆx. It is noted that the term ∇ · (ǫ − ǫ0)E associated with the polarization
charge vanishes, since both permittivity ǫ and ﬁeld E are supposed to have no variations
along the z direction of the ﬁeld.

Suppose that the solution of this wave equation is of a harmonic form as Ez = E0eikxe−iωt,
where x is referred to the local-ether frame and E0 is an arbitrary constant. Then the pre-
ceding wave equation immediately leads to an algebraic equation

It is easy to show that to the ﬁrst order of normalized speed, the propagation constant k
can be given in terms of the angular frequency ω as

It is noted that this propagation constant depends on the speed vmx, in addition to the
familiar dependence on permittivity ǫ. Consequently, this relation presents a modiﬁcation
of the propagation constant due to the motion of the dielectric medium with respect to the
local ether. Physically, the dependence on the matrix speed originates from the situation
that the polarization current and its time derivative in the wave equation are referred to
the matrix frame rather than to the local-ether one.

The phase speed c′ (= ω/k) of the electromagnetic wave propagating in the moving

dielectric medium is then given by

where the phase speed is referred to the local-ether frame and the refractive index n =

It is seen that the component of the matrix velocity parallel to the propagation direction
aﬀects the phase speed, while the transverse components do not.

The wave equation (20) can also be written in the matrix frame. To the ﬁrst order of

normalized speed, this wave equation reads

− vmx,

which states that the diﬀerence in the observed phase speed between the two reference frames
is just the relative speed between the frames along the propagation direction. In other words,
the derived phase speeds in the two frames comply with Galilean transformations.

The phase speed given in (23) is similar to the speed obtained from the velocity trans-
formation in the special relativity, which in turn is known to have been demonstrated in the
famous Fizeau’s interferometry experiment with ﬂowing water. However, the fundamental
diﬀerence is that the phase speed c′ and the matrix velocity vm are referred speciﬁcally
to the local-ether frame. Thus the matrix velocity vm incorporates the laboratory velocity
v0 with respect to the local-ether frame. An old interpretation of the dependence of the
phase speed on the medium velocity given in (23) is known as the Fresnel drag eﬀect [6, 7],
whereby the ether is dragged partially by the moving medium to an extent depending on
the index n. If n is large enough, c′ ≃ c/n + vmx and c′
m ≃ c/n. It is seen that the phase
speed with respect to the moving medium is independent of the velocity of the medium.

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

Thus it seems that the ether is completely dragged by the medium. However, according to
the wave equation of electric ﬁeld (15), the earth local ether is still stationary in an ECI
frame, regardless of the permittivity and the velocity of a terrestrial medium. The change
in the phase speed of a wave propagating in a dielectric medium, stationary or moving, is
due to the eﬀect of the polarization which in turn is induced by and related to electric ﬁeld.
Further, it is noted that the interpretation similar to the ether dragging is applicable only
for a uniform plane wave propagating in a uniform dielectric medium and is correct only to
the ﬁrst order. In other words, according to the local-ether wave equation, the phase-speed
formula (23) does not hold in a magnetic medium and can be no longer valid in a nonuni-
form dielectric medium where polarization charge emerges. Thus the applicability of the
phase-speed formula has some hidden restrictions. This presents a viewpoint diﬀerent from
the ether-dragging notion and another discrepancy from the special relativity.

4. Reexamination of Various Interferometry Experiments

In this section we reexamine some precision interferometry experiments reported in the
literature to test the local-ether wave equation of electric ﬁeld. They include the ﬁber-link
experiment with a geostationary setup and a geostationary optical ﬁber, the Sagnac loop
interferometry with a rotating path and a comoving or geostationary dielectric medium, and
Fizeau’s experiment with a geostationary interferometer and a moving dielectric medium.
For these earthbound experiments, the local ether is stationary in an ECI frame and hence
earth’s rotation should be taken into consideration, even for a geostationary medium or
path. On the other hand, these experiments are entirely independent of earth’s orbital
motion around the Sun or others.

4.1. Phase variation with moving medium and path

First of all, consider an interferometer of which each segment of propagation path has a
ﬁxed shape and is implemented with a pair of mirrors in air, with a pipe ﬁlled with ﬂowing
dielectric liquid, or with a solid dielectric ﬁber. Remark that for an electromagnetic wave
propagating in an arbitrary direction ˆl along a path ﬁlled with a dielectric medium moving
at a velocity vm with respect to the local-ether frame, the propagation constant can be
written as

k = k0

n +

n

1 − n
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

2

ˆl · vm/c

,

o

where k0 = ω/c and n is the refractive index of the uniform moving medium.

Further, consider a propagation path segment of length l, such as a linear section of the
pipe or ﬁber. Owing to the movement of the segment during the wave propagation through
it, the propagation range which represents the actual propagation length is not actually l.
As in the classical propagation model, the propagation range l′ depends on the velocity of
the path segment with respect to the local ether. The inﬂuence on propagation due to the
diﬀerence between the propagation range l′ and the path length l is known as the Sagnac
eﬀect. By following the derivation of the Sagnac eﬀect for electromagnetic wave propagating
in free space discussed elaborately in [1], the propagation range l′ for a wave propagating in
the direction ˆl along a moving segment, when given to the ﬁrst order of normalized speed,
is

′

l

= l

1 + nˆl · vl/c

,

n
where vl is the velocity of the path segment with respect to the local-ether frame.

o

It is supposed that the phase variation over the propagation path is given by φ = kl′. To
the ﬁrst order of normalized speed, the phase variation associated with the moving medium
and path is then given from the two preceding formulas by

(26)

(27)

(28)

φ = k0l

n + (1 − n2)ˆl · vm/c + n2ˆl · vl/c
n

o

.

It is seen that the phase variation depends on the longitudinal (to the propagation path) ˆl
components of the medium velocity and the path velocity both with respect to the local-

7

ether frame. Furthermore, these longitudinal-speed terms connect with the refractive index.
Thereby, in addition to the familiar eﬀect on the propagation constant, the refractive index
also has eﬀects on the matrix-velocity modiﬁcation of the propagation constant and the path-
velocity modiﬁcation of the propagation length. The preceding phase-variation formula can
be rewritten as

φ = k0l

n + n2ˆl · vlm/c + ˆl · vm/c
n

o

,

(29)

where vlm = vl − vm denotes the Newtonian relative velocity of the moving path with
respect to the moving dielectric medium.
It is seen that one of the velocity-dependent
terms depends on the refractive index and is associated with a Newtonian relative velocity,
while the other velocity-dependent term is independent of the index and is associated with
the individual velocity of the dielectric medium. For the case where the medium comoves
with the propagation path (vlm = 0), the velocity-dependent phase variation is no longer
dependent on the index.

4.2. Geostationary ﬁber-link experiment

Then we consider the experiment of one-way ﬁber link by Krisher et al., where the phase
diﬀerence between two waves generated from two identical stable hydrogen masers at 100
MHz was measured by using a network analyzer [8]. The two masers are separated by a
long distance of 21 km and linked by a stable optical ﬁber. One signal was fed directly
into the analyzer, while the other was used to modulate a laser carrier to propagate over
the ﬁber. For a geostationary ﬁber, vm = vl = vE, where vE is the linear velocity due to
earth’s rotation. Then formula (29) immediately leads to that the phase variation dφ over
a geostationary ﬁber segment of diﬀerential length dl is given by

Thus the phase variation over a propagation path L of length l is given by the path integral

dφ = k0

n + ˆl · vE/c

dl.

(cid:19)

where the directed diﬀerential length dl = ˆldl. It is noted that the velocity-dependent part
is independent of the refractive index, since the velocity diﬀerence vlm = 0. Furthermore,
it is noted that although the velocity-dependent phase variation is due to earth’s rotation,
its value is invariant under this rotation. This is because that both vE and dl change in
a coordinated way such that their dot product remains unchanged during earth’s rotation.
This invariance is in accord with the spatial isotropy demonstrated in the one-way ﬁber-link
experiment, where it is observed that the phase variation is highly stable (as determined
from the phase diﬀerence between the two waves measured every a few seconds during a
couple of days), regardless of earth’s rotational and orbital motions [8].

When the ﬁber link is placed in a geographically small region such that the velocity vE
due to earth’s rotation is substantially constant, the phase variation over the link becomes

φ = k0

nl +

vE · d

(cid:18)

,

(cid:19)

c

where d is the directed separation distance from the end through which the light enters the
ﬁber to the other end. It is noted that the phase variation is independent of the actual
wiring, but depends on the orientation of the distance d with respect to the ground. If the
ﬁber-link experimental setup is put on a turntable or a rotor, it is expected that the phase
variation will change as the turntable is rotating even slowly. From the minor term in the
preceding formula, the dependence of the phase variation on the orientation of the rotor is
given by

δφ =

where RE is earth’s radius, θl is the latitude, θT is the angle of the distance d from the east,
and the turntable is suitably positioned on a horizontal plane so that the gravitational eﬀect
on ω is avoided. The phase variation associated with earth’s rotation is independent of the
refractive index of the ﬁber and hence is identical to the one in the case with a free-space
link discussed in [1]. It is noted that the phase variation becomes maximum and minimum,
as the distance d points to the east and the west, respectively. Furthermore, the phase
variation changes sinusoidally with the angle θT . This dipole anisotropy in phase variation
predicted in the proposed one-way-link rotor experiment then provides a means to test the
local-ether wave equation.

4.3. Sagnac rotating-loop experiments

Consider the Sagnac eﬀect in a rotating-loop interferometer associated with the interfer-
ence between two coherent waves corotating and counterrotating with respect to the prop-
agation loop, respectively. Commonly, the propagation path is composed of beam splitter
and mirrors in air. Then the phase diﬀerence between the two waves results from the situa-
tion that the modiﬁcation of propagation length due to the rotation of the loop is diﬀerent
between these waves propagating in opposite directions. Here, we deal with a propagation
path ﬁlled with a general dielectric medium rather than a free space.

Suppose that the loop is rotating about an axis as observed from a laboratory, which
in turn is rotating with the Earth. The velocity of the path segment with respect to the
an ECI frame is given by vl = vI + vE0 + v0, where v0 is the laboratory velocity with
respect to an ECI frame referred to a suitable point r0 on the interferometer rotation axis,
vI = ¯ωI × (r − r0) and vE0 = ¯ωE × (r − r0) denote the other contributions to the path
velocity due to the rotations of the loop and the Earth at the directed rotation rates ¯ωI
and ¯ωE, respectively, and r is the position vector of the path segment in the frame of the
reference point r0.

Consider the case where the medium is comoving with the rotating loop. Thus the
velocity diﬀerence vlm = 0 and hence formula (29) leads to that the phase variation dφ over
a propagation path of diﬀerential length dl is given by

The unit vectors ˆl denoting the propagation directions of the two counterpropagating waves
are antiparallel to each other in each path segment. Thus the diﬀerence in the phase variation
over the loop L between the two waves is then given by the path integral

dφ = k0

n + ˆl · vl/c
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

dl.

△φ =

(vI + vE0) · dl,

2k0
c IL

where we have made use of the facts that the major term k0ndl in (34) is identical for
the two waves and hence its contributions to the phase diﬀerence cancel out and that the
contributions of a constant vector v0 to the phase variation over a closed path cancel out
collectively, regardless of the actual structure of the loop.

Suppose the loop is coplanar. Then, by using a vector identity, the phase diﬀerence can

be given by

△φ =

(¯ωI + ¯ωE) · S,

4k0
c

where S (= 1
L(r − r0) × dl) denotes the directed area enclosed by loop L. It is noted
2
that the phase diﬀerence is independent of the index n and hence is identical to the one
H
in the case with a free-space path discussed in [1]. Again, this independence is owing to
the coincidence that the index-dependent modiﬁcation of the propagation constant happens
to cancel the one of the propagation length. This null eﬀect of the refractive index on the
phase diﬀerence in the Sagnac loop interferometry has been demonstrated experimentally by
Harzer in as early as 1914 [9]. Further, the preceding phase-diﬀerence formula has been put

(34)

(35)

(36)

in practical use in ﬁber gyroscopes [10-12]. Alternative derivations of this formula by taking
the Sagnac eﬀect and the modiﬁcations of phase speed into account can be found in [9-
11]. Anyway, in spite of the restriction on reference frame, the local-ether wave equation of
electric ﬁeld is in accord with the Sagnac interferometry experiment with a rotating loop and
a comoving dielectric medium. On the other hand, the local-ether wave equation precludes
the possibility of detecting earth’s orbital motion by using earthbound ﬁber gyroscopes.

Next, consider the case where the medium is geostationary while the propagation loop
is still rotating with respect to the laboratory. Thus vlm = vI , vm = vE0 + v0, and hence
formula (29) leads to that the phase variation dφ over a path of diﬀerential length dl is given
by

dφ = k0dl

n + n

2ˆl · vI /c + ˆl · vE0/c + ˆl · v0/c

.

(cid:16)
The corresponding phase diﬀerence between the waves becomes

(cid:17)

(37)

(38)

△φ =

(n2 ¯ωI + ¯ωE) · S.

4k0
c

It is seen that the phase diﬀerence then depends on the index n which in turn connects
to the loop rotation rate ¯ωI. Again, the phase variation associated with earth’s rotation is
independent of the index and the phase diﬀerence is independent of the laboratory velocity
v0. Ordinarily, ωE ≪ ωI and hence the phase diﬀerence is substantially proportional to n2.
This index-dependence of the phase diﬀerence is identical to that given in [9], although the
approach is quite diﬀerent. The increase of phase diﬀerence in the presence of a stationary
dielectric medium has been demonstrated experimentally by Dufour and Prunier in 1942
[9]. The various index-dependences among the terms connected to the rate ¯ωI or ¯ωE in (36)
and (38) then provide another means to test the local-ether wave equation.

4.4. Fizeau’s experiment with moving medium

The last case is then the one where the interferometer is stationary while the medium
is moving. Consider Fizeau’s experiment dealing with the interference between two optical
waves propagating in opposite directions along a stationary pipe ﬁlled with ﬂowing water.
For generality, suppose that the pipe together with beam splitters, mirrors, and other com-
ponents of the interferometer is stationary in a laboratory frame which in turn moves at
a velocity v0 with respect to an ECI frame. As the interferometer is geographically small,
the path velocity is substantially constant over the setup. Thus the path velocity vl = v0.
Further, suppose that the water is ﬂowing at a velocity vf with respect to the pipe. Then
the velocity diﬀerence vlm = −vf , the matrix velocity vm = vf + v0, and hence formula
(29) leads to that the phase variation dφ over a pipe of diﬀerential length dl is given by

dφ = k0dl

n + (1 − n2)ˆl · vf /c + ˆl · v0/c
n

o

,

(39)

where n is the index of the ﬂowing water and ˆl · vf = ±vf for the two beams.

It is seen that the phase variation depends on the laboratory velocity. However, the
eﬀect of this velocity on phase variation can not be detected in Fizeau’s experiment. This
is because that the optical path actually adopted in the experiment is closed, part of the
path is ﬁlled with ﬂowing water and part is merely with air (see the ﬁgure in [13] or [14]).
It is noted that in the preceding formula the velocity v0 does not connect to the index n.
Again, the phase variation over a closed path given by the circulation of a constant vector
v0 is zero.

As in the Sagnac loop interferometry, the two waves to be interfered propagate in op-
posite directions in each individual segment of the path. From the preceding formula it is
seen that those parts of the path ﬁlled with air or with a dielectric at rest with the pipe
do not contribute to the phase diﬀerence between the waves. The contribution comes only
from the water-ﬂowing pipe. Suppose that the water speed vf is uniform and the total

10

length of the water-ﬂowing pipe is l. Then the diﬀerence in phase variation between the two
counterpropagating waves is given by

△φ = 2k0l(n

− 1)vf /c.

2

(40)

It is noted that the phase diﬀerence is linearly proportional to (n2 − 1) and to the water
speed vf with respect to the pipe. The preceding phase-diﬀerence formula agrees with the
interference fringe observed in Fizeau’s experiment with various speeds vf and indices n.

More precisely, the path velocity vl is not actually a constant value v0 over the closed
path. That is, vl = vE0 + v0 and vm = vf + vE0 + v0, where v0 is referred to a suitable
point in the setup. Hence the Sagnac eﬀect in a loop interferometer due to earth’s rotation
should also appear in Fizeau’s experiment. However, as earth’s rotation rate is relatively
slow, its eﬀect in Fizeau’s experiment is ordinarily much smaller than that due to the motion
of the medium, just as its eﬀect in the rotating-loop experiment is ordinarily much smaller
than that due to the rotation of the loop. Thereby, the phase diﬀerence is substantially
independent of earth’s rotation. Furthermore, at least to the ﬁrst order of normalized speed,
Fizeau’s experiment together with the Sagnac rotating-loop experiments is independent
of the laboratory velocity v0 and hence complies with Galilean relativity, in spite of the
restriction on reference frame of the medium and the path velocities.

5. Conclusion

Based on the local-ether model of wave propagation, the propagation of the potentials
is referred speciﬁcally to an ECI frame in earthbound experiments. Further, under the
ordinary condition of low drift speed, the electromagnetic force can be given in terms of
electric and magnetic ﬁelds which in turn are given explicitly in terms of the local-ether
potentials. The position vectors, time derivatives, particle velocities, propagation velocity,
and current density involved are all referred speciﬁcally to their respective reference frames.
Consequently, the values of potentials, ﬁelds, and force remain unchanged in diﬀerent frames.
Further, based on the deﬁnitions of ﬁelds in terms of potentials, the local-ether wave
equations of ﬁelds are derived. From the wave equation of magnetic ﬁeld, the phase speed
of electromagnetic wave in a uniform magnetic medium is found to depend on the perme-
ability, but not on the motion of the medium. However, from the wave equation of electric
ﬁeld, the phase speed of a uniform plane wave propagating in a moving uniform dielectric
medium is found to depend on the longitudinal component of the medium velocity and
hence to incorporate the familiar Fresnel drag coeﬃcient. This phase speed looks like the
speed obtained from the velocity transformation in the special relativity. However, the fun-
damental diﬀerence is that the phase and the matrix speeds are referred speciﬁcally to the
local-ether frame. Moreover, this phase-speed formula is not expected to hold in a magnetic
or a nonuniform dielectric medium.

By taking the matrix-velocity modiﬁcation of the propagation constant and the Sagnac
path-velocity modiﬁcation of the propagation length into account, the phase variation over
a moving path ﬁlled with a moving dielectric medium is presented. Thereby, this phase-
variation formula is applied to analyze various precision interferometry experiments in a
consistent way. It is found that this formula is actually in accord with the spatial isotropy
in the one-way ﬁber-link experiment, with the null eﬀect of permittivity in the Sagnac
interferometer with a dielectric medium comoving with the rotating loop, with the increase
of phase diﬀerence in the Sagnac interferometer with a geostationary dielectric medium,
and with the dependence of phase diﬀerence on the speed and index of the ﬂowing water
in Fizeau’s experiment. These together provide a support for the local-ether wave equation
of electric ﬁeld. Moreover, it is predicted that as the ﬁber-link experimental setup is put
on a turntable, the phase variation over the link will change sinusoidally as the orientation
of turntable is changing. This proposed one-way-link rotor experiment, the predicted null
eﬀect of earth’s orbital motion in earthbound interferometers, the predicted various index-
dependences among the phase-shift terms connected to the rotation rate of the loop or of the
Earth in the Sagnac interferometer, and the aforementioned discrepancies in the phase-speed

11

formula for a moving medium and the restrictions on this formula then provide diﬀerent
approaches to test the local-ether wave equation.

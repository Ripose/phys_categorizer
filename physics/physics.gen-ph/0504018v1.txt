ON FRIEDMANN’S UNIVERSES

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. There is a perfect concordance between Friedmann’s cosmo-
logical models and the correspondent (purely gravitational interactions
and negligible pressure) Newtonian models. This renders quite intu-
itive the fact that in general relativity no motion of bodies generates
gravitational waves.

1. - As it is well known, Friedmann’s cosmological models [1] can be char-
acterized in the following way:

i) A spacetime interval ds given by Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric

and ζ = 0, ±1, r2 = (x1)2 + (x2)2 + (x3)2; F (x0) is a function of time to
be determined by Einstein ﬁeld equations. Eq.(1) yields the most general
metric expression describing a uniform (i.e. homogeneous and isotropic)
three-dimensional space. (ζ = 0: Euclidean space; ζ = 1: spherical – or
elliptical – space; ζ = −1: hyperbolic space).

ii) A mass tensor T jk, (j, k = 0, 1, 2, 3), of the galaxy “dust”, given by

(2)

(c = 1),

where ρ is the invariant mass density. A “dust” particle represents a
galaxy. The particles interact only gravitationally. Eq.(1) is written in
a particular Gaussian-normal coordinate frame [2] – synchronous frame,
according to the expressive terminology of Landau-Lifchitz [2]. For frames
of this kind the time lines are geodesic lines. Remark that for any physical
system of particles, the mass tensor of which is given by eq.(2), the world
lines of the particles are geodesic lines, and therefore no gravitational wave

can be emitted [3]. Thus, our coordinate frame is synchronous and comoving
[4] – and the galaxy trajectories are geodesic lines. We have:

Clearly, the distance between two galaxies is proportional to the function
F of time. The solutions of eqs.(5), (6) are well known: for ζ = 1, we have a
cosmic periodic oscillation between F = 0 and F = Fmax; for ζ = 0, −1 we
have a cosmic monotonic expansion. In all cases, ζ/F 2(x0) is the curvature
of the space section x0 = constant. For F = 0 the density ρ is inﬁnite and
the gravitational ﬁeld is singular.

2.
- In the Thirties of the past century, a Newtonian cosmology was de-
veloped: an investigation of the kinds of ﬂow in a galaxy “dust”, when ho-
mogeneity, isotropy, and irrotational ﬂow are assumed [5]. A galaxy which
is on the surface of an expanding sphere of radius ℜ(t) is attracted by the
mass M within the sphere according to Newton’s law:

¨ℜ = − κM

eqs. (5) and (6).

If we put η = 0, ±1, eqs. (7”) and (8) become identical to Friedmann’s

We have here three Newtonian models which, starting from a singular
point of an inﬁnite mass density, give either a monotonic expansion (for
η = 0, −1) or a periodic oscillation (for η = 1) between ℜ = 0 and ℜ = ℜmax.
The concordance with Friedmann’s results is complete.

The Newtonian eqs. (7”) and (8) give in a three-dimensional Euclidean
Bildraum three faithful representations of the Einsteinian eqs.(5) and (6).
Vice-versa, the Einsteinian eqs. (5) and (6) give in three three-dimensional
Bildr¨aume (resp. Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic) three faithful represen-
tations of the Newtonian eqs. (7”) and (8).

3. - The Newtonian images of the Einsteinian Friedmann’s models render
quite intuitive the physical fact that in general relativity no motion of bodies
generates gravitational waves [6]. (Let us observe that Birkhoﬀ’s theorem [7]
regards only the outside space of a spherically symmetric mass distribution).
Another remark. The Oppenheimer-Snyder treatment of the spherically
symmetric collapse of a “dust” (with negligible pressure) – simpliﬁed image
of a gravitationally collapsing star – utilizes Friedmann’s formalism relative
to the return motion in a periodic oscillation, from F = Fmax to F = 0 [8].
These authors describe the gravitational ﬁeld in the outside space of the star
with the standard Hilbert-Droste-Weyl form of solution of the Schwarzschild
problem, improperly called “Schwarzschild solution”. Now, this form is
actually not suitable to the present problem, because it is mathematically
and physically valid only for r > 2GM/c2. Neglecting erroneously this fact,
one obtains a black hole as a ﬁnal product of the contraction. But if we
employ the ORIGINAL form of solution given by Schwarzschild [9], which
is regular for all values of the radial coordinate r diﬀerent from zero (and
is diﬀeomorphic to the exterior part, r > 2GM/c2, of the standard HDW-
form), we obtain simply a point mass, i.e. a quite usual object [10] in lieu
of a ﬁctive black hole.

This conclusion is corroborated by the following consideration. If we em-
ploy the Newtonian formalism (sect.2.) relative to the return motion in a
periodic oscillation, the problem of the sphero-symmetric gravitational col-
lapse of a star becomes quite simple – and the ﬁnal result is quite standard:
a Newtonian point mass. (Very keen papers on gravitational collapse – from
both the standpoints, Einsteinian and Newtonian – have been published by
Mc Vittie [11]).

The so-called observed black holes are only very large – or enormously
large – masses concentrated in relatively small volumes. as it can be veriﬁed
very easily with a careful reading of the concerned papers.

- The previous formalisms are well known in the pertinent literature,
only the perspective according to which they are here considered is new. I

have emphasized the great signiﬁcance of Friedmann’s results in regard to
the question of the gravitational waves.

There is a perfect parallelism between the time variation of the curva-
ture ζ/F 2(t) of the spatial section t = const and the time variation of
its Newtonian analogue η/ℜ2(t), which is proportional to Newton’s force
κM/[8πℜ2(t)].

In general – and roughly speaking: a displacement of a given mass causes
a corresponding displacement of its Newton’s force and a corresponding
displacement of the Einsteinian space curvature. No gravitational wave is
ever generated, the analogy between Einstein ﬁeld and Maxwell-Lorentz ﬁeld
is a misleading analogy.

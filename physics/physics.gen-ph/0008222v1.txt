P-Loop Oscillator on Cliﬀord Manifolds and

Black Hole Entropy

Carlos Castro ∗ and Alex Granik†

Abstract

A new relativity theory, or more concretely an extended relativity
theory, actively developed by one of the authors incorporated 3 basic
concepts. They are the old Chu’s idea about bootstarpping, Nottale’s
scale relativity, and enlargement of the conventional time-space by in-
clusion of noncommutative Cliﬀord manifolds where all p-branes are
treated on equal footing. The latter allowed one to write a master
action functional. The resulting functional equation is simpliﬁed and
applied to the p-loop oscillator. Its respective solution is a general-
ization of the conventional point oscillator. In addition , it exhibits
some novel features: an emergence of two explicit scales delineating
the asymptotic regimes (Planck scale region and a smooth region of
a conventional point oscillator). In the most interesting Planck scale
regime, the solution reproduces in an elementary fashion the basic
relations of string theory ( including string tension quantization). In
addition, it is shown that comparing the massive ( super) string degen-
eracy with the p-loop degeneracy one is arriving at the proportionality
between the Shannon entropy of a p-loop oscillator in D-dimensional
space and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole of a size
comparable with a string scale.
In conclusion the Regge behavior
follows from the solution in an elementary fashion.

1 Introduction

Recently a new relativity was introduced [1] -[8] with a purpose to develop a
viable physical theory describing the quantum ”reality” without introducing
by hand a priori existing background. This theory is based upon 3 main
concepts:
1) Chew’s bootstrap idea about an evolving physical system generating its
own background in the process.
2) Nottale’s scale relativity [9]-[10] which adopts the Planck scale Λ = 1.62×
10−35m as the minimum attainable scale in nature.
3) a generalization of the ordinary space-time ( the concept most important
for our analysis) by introduction of non-commutative C-spaces leading to
full covariance of a quantum mechanical loop equation. This is achieved by
extending the concepts of ordinary space-time vectors and tensors to non-
commutative Cliﬀord manifolds (it explains the name C-space) where all
p-branes are uniﬁed on the basis of Cliﬀord multivectors. As a result, there
exists a one-to-one correspondence between single lines in Cliﬀord manifolds
and a nested hierarchy of 0-loop, 1-loop,..., p-loop histories in D dimensions
( D=p − 1) encoded in terms of hypermatrices.
The respective master action functional S{Ψ[X(Σ)]} of quantum ﬁeld theory
in C-space [11, 4] is

S{Ψ[X(Σ)]} = R [ 1

where Σ is an invariant evolution parameter (a generalization of the proper
time in special relativity) such that

(dΣ)2 = (dΩp+1)2 + Λ2p(dxµdxµ) + Λ2(p−1)dσµνdσµν + ...
+(dσµ1µ2...µp+1dσµ1µ2...µp+1)

and

X(Σ) = Ωp+1I + Λpxµγµ + Λp−1σµνγµγν + ...

(3)

is a Cliﬀord algebra-valued line ”living” on the Cliﬀord manifold outside
space-time. Multivector X Eq.(3) incorporates both a point history given by
the ordinary ( vector) coordinates xµ and the holographic projections of the
nested family of all p-loop histories onto the embedding coordinate spacetime

2

hyperplanes σµ1µ2...µp+1. The scalar Ωp+1 is the invariant proper p + 1 = D-
volume associated with a motion of a maximum dimension p-loop across the
p+1 = D-dim target spacetime. Since a Cliﬀordian multivector with D basis
elements ( say, e1, e2, ..., eD) has 2D components our vector X has also 2D
components.
Generally speaking, action (1) generates a master Cantorian (strongly frac-
tal) ﬁeld theory with a braided Hopf quantum Cliﬀord algebra. This action is
unique in a sense that the above algebra selects terms allowed by the action.
In what follows we restrict our attention to a truncated version of the theory
by applying it to a linear p-loop oscillator.
This truncation is characterized by the following 3 simpliﬁcations. First, we
dropped nonlinear terms in the action, that is the cubic term ( corresponding
to vertices) and the quartic (braided scattering) term. Secondly, we freeze
all the holographic modes and keep only the zero modes which would yield
conventional diﬀerential equations instead of functional ones. Thirdly, we
assume that the metric in C-space is ﬂat.

2 Linear Non-Relativistic p-loop Oscillator

As a result of the postulated simpliﬁcations we obtain from the action (1) a
C-space p-loop wave equation for a linear oscillator

the spacetime-ﬁlling p-brane, mp+1 is the parameter of dimension (mass)p+1
, parameter L (to be deﬁned later) has dimension lengthp+1 and we use units
¯h = 1, c = 1. A generalized correspondence principle 1 allows us to introduce
the following qualitative correspondence between the parameters mp+1, L,
and mass m and amplitude a of a point (particle) oscillator:

∂σµα

mp+1(”mass”) ←→ m,
L(”amplitude”) ←→ a

1In the limit of Λ/a → 0 volume Ωp+1, holographic coordinates σµν , σµνρ, ... → 0, and
p-loop oscillator should become a point oscillator, that is p-loop histories collapse to a
point history

where T = T /qAmp+1 is the dimensionless tension,

˜xµ = A1/4 Λp

L xµ, ˜σµν = A1/4σµν

Λp−1

L , ..., ˜Ωp+1 = A1/4 Ωp+1

are the dimensionless arguments, ˜xµ has CD
CD

(D−2)!2! components, etc. and

2 ≡ D!

1 ≡ D components, ˜σµν has

A ≡ mp+1L2/Λp+1

Without any loss of generality we can set A = 1 by absorbing it into L.
This will give the following geometric mean relation between the parameters
L, mp+1, and Λ

L2 = Λp+1/mp+1

The dimensionless coordinates then become

˜xµ = qΛp+1mp+1 xµ/Λ, ˜σµν = qΛp+1mp+1 σµν/Λ2, ...,
˜Ωp+1 = qΛp+1mp+1 Ωp+1/Λp+1

As a result we obtain a new dimensionless combination Λp+1mp+1 indicating
p+1 . It is easily seen that
existence of two separate scales : Λ and (1/mp+1)
this dimensionless combination obeys the following double inequality:

1

qmp+1Λp+1 < 1 < s

1

mp+1Λp+1

(6)

Relations (6) deﬁne two asymptotic regions:

1)the ”fractal” region characterized by mp+1Λp+1 ∼ 1(area of Planck scales)
and
2)the ”smooth” region characterized by mp+1Λp+1 >> 1.

4

Since equation (5)is diagonal in its arguments we represent its solution as a
product of separate functions of each of the dimensionless arguments ˜xµ, ˜σµν, ...,

Ψ = Yi

Fi(˜xi) Yj<k

Fjk(˜σjk)...

(7)

Inserting (7) into (5) we get for each of these functions the Whittaker equa-
tion:

Z ′′ − (2T − ˜y2)Z = 0

(8)

where Z is any function Fi, Fij, ..., ˜y is the respective dimensionless variable
˜xµ,˜σµν, ..., and there are all in all 2D such equations. The bounded solution
of (8) is expressed in terms of the Hermite polynomials Hn(˜y)

Therefore the solution to Eq.(5) is

Z ∼ e−˜y2/2Hn(˜y)

(9)

Ψ ∼ exp[−(˜x2

µ + ˜σ2

µν + ... + ˜Ωp+1)]Yi

Hni(˜xi)Yjk

Hnjk(˜σjk)...

(10)

where there are D terms corresponding to n1, n2, ..., nD, D(D − 1)/2 terms
corresponding to n01, n02, ..., etc. Thus the total number of terms corre-
sponding to the N-th excited state (N = nx1 + nx2 + ... + nσ01 + nσ02 + ...) is
2D.
The respective value of the tension of the N-th excited state is

TN = (N +

1
2

2D)mp+1

(11)

yielding quantization of tension.
Expression (11) is the analog of the respective value of the N-th energy state
for a point oscillator. The analogy however is not complete. We point out
one substantial diﬀerence. Since according to a new relativity principle [1]
-[8] all the dimensions are treated on equal footing (there are no preferred
dimensions) all the modes of the p-loop oscillator( center of mass xµ, holo-
graphic modes, p + 1 volume) are to be excited collectively. This behavior is
in full compliance with the principle of polydimensional invariance by Pez-
zagalia [12]. As a result, the ﬁrst excited state is not N = 1 ( as could be
naively expected) but rather N = 2D. Therefore

2(2Dmp+1)

T1 → T2D = 3

instead of the familiar (3/2)m.
Recalling that L is analogous to the amplitude a and using the analogy
between energy E ∼ mω2a2 and tension T , we get T = mp+1Ω2L2. Inserting
this expression into Eq.(11) we arrive at the deﬁnition of the ”frequency” Ω
of the p-loop oscillator:

ΩN = r(N + 2D−1)

mp+1
Λp+1

(12)

where we use L = qΛp+1/mp+1.

Having obtained the solution to Eq.(5), we consider in more detail the two
limiting cases corresponding to the above deﬁned 1) fractal and 2) smooth
regions. The latter ( according to the correspondence principle) should be
described by the expressions for a point oscillator. In particular, this means
that

xµ

˜xµ =

Λ qmp+1Λp+1 → xµ/a

(13)

where parameter a >> Λ is a ﬁnite quantity ( amplitude) and we use R = 1.
Using Eq.(13) we ﬁnd

mp+1 → (MP lanck)p+1(

Λ
a

)2 << (MP lanck)p+1

(14)

where the Planck mass MP lanck ≡ 1/Λ. From Eqs.(11) and (12) follows that
in this region

TN ∼ (MP lanck)p+1( Λ
ΩN ∼ (ωP lanck)p+1 Λ
ωP lanck = 1/Λ

a )2 << (MP lanck)p+1
a << (ωP lanck)p+1

(15)

in full agreement with this region’s scales as compared to the Planck scales.
At the other end of the spectrum ( fractal region) where mp+1Λp+1 ∼ 1 we
would witness a collapse of all the scales to only one scale, namely the Planck
scale Λ. In particular, this means that a ∼ Λ, and the oscillator parameters
become

˜xµ =

, mp+1 ∼

Λp+1 ≡ (MP lanck)p+1, T ∼ mp+1 ∼

(16)
These relations are the familiar relations of string theory. In particular, if we
set p = 1 we get the basic string relation

6

T ∼ 1

Λ2 ≡ 1

α′

Above we got two asymptotic expression for mp+1

mp+1 = ( Λ−(p+1)(Λ/a)2

Λ−(p+1)

if Λ/a << 1
if mp+1/Λp+1 ∼ 1, a ∼ Λ

This indicates that we can represent mp+1Λp+1 as power series in (Λ/a)2 (e.g.,
cf. analogous procedure in hydrodynamics [13]):

mp+1Λp+1 = ( Λ

a )2[1 + α1( Λ

a )2 + α2( Λ

a )4 + ...]

where the coeﬃcients αi are such that the series is convergent for a ∼ Λ.
If p = 1 then using the fact that in this case energy Tground = 2m2 (see
footnote2), returning to the units ¯h, and introducing 1/a = ω ( where ω is
the characteristic frequency) we get (cf.ref [5])

¯hef f = ¯hq1 + α1( Λ

a )2 + α2( Λ

a )4 + ...

Truncating the series at the second term , we recover the string uncertainty
relation

¯hef f = ¯h[1 + (α1/2)(Λ/a)2]

Interestingly enough, the string uncertainty relation still did not have ” a
proper theoretical framework for the extra term” [14]. On the other hand,
this relation emerges as one of the results of our theoretical model.
As a next step we ﬁnd the degeneracy associated with the N-th excited level
of the p-loop oscillator. The degeneracy dg(N) is equal to the number of par-
titions of the number N into a set of 2D numbers {nx1, nx2, , ..., nxD, nσµν, nσµνρ, ...}:

dg(N) =

Γ(2D + N)

Γ(N + 1)Γ(2D)

(17)

where Γ is the gamma function.
We compare dg(N) (17) with the asymptotic quantum degeneracy of a mas-
sive (super) string state given by Li and Yoneya [15]:

dg(n) = exp [2πsn

ds − 2

6

]

(18)

2that is for a point oscillator we get Eground = ¯hω/2 =pTground/8

7

where ds is the string dimension and n >> 1. To this end we equate (18)
and degeneracy (17) of the ﬁrst excited state ( N = 2D) of the p-loop. This
could be justiﬁed on physical grounds as follows. One can consider diﬀerent
frames in a new relativity: one frame where an observer sees only strings (
with a given degeneracy) and another frame where the same observer sees a
collective excitations of points, strings, membranes,p-loops, etc. The results
pertinent to the degeneracy (represented by a number) should be invariant
in any frame.
Solving the resulting equation with respect to √n we get

√n =

1

2πs 6
ds − 2

Ln[

Γ(2D+1)

Γ(2D + 1)Γ(2D)

]

(19)

The condition n >> 1 implies that D >> 1 thus simplifying (19).
If we
set ds = 26 ( a bosonic string) and use the asymptotic representation of the
logarithm of the gamma function for large values of its argument

LnΓ(z) = Ln(√2π) + (z − 1/2)Ln(z) − z + O(1/z)

we get:

√n ≈ 2D ln(2)

2π ∼ 2D−1 ∼ N

(20)

From (Eq.18) follows that for n >> 1 Ln[dg(n)] ∼ √n. On the other hand,
Li and Yoneya [15] showed that in this case √n ∼ SBH ,where SBH is the

Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole. Taking into ac-
count Eq. (20) we obtain

SBH ∼ 2D−1

(21)

This is a rather remarkable fact: the Shannon entropy of a p-loop oscillator
in D-dimensional space ( for a suﬃciently large D), that is a number N =
2D ( the number of bits representing all the holographic coordinates), is
proportional to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black
hole.
Finally, Eq.(20) allows us to easily derive the Regge behavior of a string
spectrum for large values of n >> 1. To this end we associate with each bit
of a p-loop oscillator fundamental Planck length Λ, area Λ2 , mass 1/Λ,etc.
As a result, l2
P lanck. On the other hand,

s ∼ Areas = N×Λ2, ms
according to (20) N ∼ √n which yields
ls ∼ √n Λ2; m2

2 = N×M 2
s ∼ √n M 2

Therefore the respective angular momentum J is

2 ∼ nM 2
where we use MP lanckΛ ≡ 1 by deﬁnition.

J = m2 × ls

P lanckΛ2 = n

3 Conclusion

Application of a simpliﬁed linearized equation derived from the master action
functional of a new ( extended) relativity to a p-loop oscillator has allowed
us to elementary obtain rather interesting results. First of all, the solution
explicitly indicates existence of 2 extreme regions characterized by the values
of the dimensionless combination mp+1Λp+1 :
1) the fractal region where mp+1Λp+1 ∼ 1 and 2 scales collapse to one, namely
Planck scale Λ
and
2) the smooth region where mp+1Λp+1 << 1 and we we recover the description
of the conventional point oscillator. Here 2 scales are present , a character-
istic ”length” a and the ubiquitous Planck scale Λ ( a << Λ)demonstrating
explicitly the implied validity of the quantum mechanical solution in the
region where a/Λ << 1.
For a speciﬁc case of p = 1 ( a string) the solution yields ( one again in an
elementary fashion) one of the basic relation of string theory T = 1/α′). In
addition, it provides us with a derived string uncertainty relation, which in
itself is a truncated version of a more general uncertainty relation [5].
Comparing the degeneracy of the ground state of the p-loop for a very large
number of of dimensions D with the respective expressions for the massive (
super) string theory given by Li and Yoneya [15] we found that the Shannon
entropy of a p-loop oscillator in D-dimensional space ( for a suﬃciently large
D), that is a number N = 2D ( the number of bits representing all the
holographic coordinates), is proportional to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
of a Schwarzschild black hole.
The Regge behavior of the string spectrum for large n >> 1also follows from
the obtained solution thus indicating its, at least qualitatively correct, char-
acter. Thus a study of a simpliﬁed model ( or ”toy”) problem of a linearized
p-loop oscillator gave us ( with the help of elementary calculations)a wealth
of both the well-known relations of string theory ( usually obtained with the

9

help of a much more complicated mathematical technique)and some addi-
tional relations ( the generalized uncertainty relation). This indicates that
the approach advocated by a new relativity might [4, 11] be very fruitful,
especially if it will be possible to obtain analytic results on the basis of the
full master action functional leading to functional nonlinear equations whose
study will involve braided Hopf groups.

Abstract

All of the known fermions ﬁt a simple formula which is presented here. The
simple formula appears to indicate a topological origin to mass generation, and it is
globally accurate to an approximate percent. Instantons or a quantized two Higgs
mechanism, as in the MSSM model, could give a simple origin to the masses.

The origin of the fermion masses has been investigated for many years. Several
mass relations including those of the form m1 ∼ m2
2 have been proposed, but without
dynamical meaning. Remarkably, there is a simple formula that matches with the
known spectrum, in the scales from an MeV to almost a TeV,

mf = 10n−4 GeV ± 2i5j MeV .

The formula in (1) matches all of the fermions, over the scales from an MeV to a TeV
to an approximate one percent.

Furthermore, the mass formula appears to ﬁt a few data points which are pub-

lished in the literature.

The remainder is the mass after subtracting 10n, and their values are presented in
units of .002 GeV; the latter indicates some kind of number similarities. The mass and
the remainder from the numbers 10n, in GeV, are given. Note that the remainders
ﬁt the pattern of 25 ∗ 10m. These number relations have apparently not appeared in
the literature.

The second terms, that is the remainders, can be ﬁt by 2i5j with i and j integers.
To a percent, the formula involving the 2s and 5s ﬁt the known particle masses. The
masses are simply,

As mentioned, the masses are reproduced to an approximate percent, which appears
to be almost as good as current experimental observations. The 2m5i contributions
appear to scale with the 10n number in a linear fashion.

As a point of reference, there are only 27 numbers out of 999 of the form 2m5i.

(Recall that the chiral N=1 multiplet of E8 has 27 entries, as a point of reference.)

The robustness of the masses in accord with the mass formulae is clear. The
possible extension to broken supersymmetric theories is interesting, and could merit
further investigation in experimental data. Anomalous events might be present in the
data that follow this pattern. It is worth pointing out that some data could involve
a factor of 3, in addition to the 2m5i factoring.

The explanation of the mass formula, involving the two terms, does suggest either
a two-Higgs contribution or instantonic ones (perhaps along the lines in a local sense
as in [1]). The MSSM does have two Higgs modes, but the quantization of these modes
is not obvious in perturbation theory. Maybe the quantization already indicates the
presence of extra dimensions through quantized Yukawa couplings.

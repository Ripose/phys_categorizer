Abstract

The discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating in time is a major discovery

which still awaits adequate explanation. It is generally agreed that this implies a cosmic repulsion

as a result of the existence of a cosmological constant ∧ > 0. However, estimates of ∧, based on

calculations of the zero-point ﬂuctuations of quantum ﬁelds are too large by over a hundred orders

of magnitude. This result is obtained by summing the zero-point energies up to a large cutoﬀ

energy Ω, based on the Planck scale. Since there is no compelling reason for this choice, we argue

that since all known quantum electrodynamic (QED) eﬀects involves interaction with matter, a

preferred choice should be based on causality and other considerations, leading to a much lower

value for ∧.

Measurements of the expansion of the universe [1] imply a vacuum energy density which

is over a hundred orders of magnitude too small compared to current theoretical calcula-

tions [2, 3] which attribute this so-called dark energy to quantum zero-point energies. The

latter embrace a variety of ﬁelds but the essence of our remarks here can be captured by

concentrating on just the normal modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The vacuum energy

density for the E-M ﬁelds is simply given by summing the zero-point energies (¯hω/2) of all

the normal modes, up to a cutoﬀ frequency Ω, to get (after inclusion of a factor 2 arising

from the fact that there are two normal modes of the E-M ﬁeld for each wave vector)

where pmax is the momentum cutoﬀ. Hence, since p = (¯hω/c), we obtain,

The current wisdom is to argue that, if general relativity is valid up to the Planck scale,

then one might guess that Ω is given by Ωp where

leading to a vacuum energy density, < ρp > say, which is over a hundred orders of magnitude

too large [2, 3].

Here, we argue that allowing Ω to have such a large value is completely ad hoc and not

based on compelling physical arguments. Instead, we take the point of view that one should

not consider vacuum ﬂuctuations in isolation but rather in interaction with matter ﬁelds

and, as a consequence, their contribution to the energy of the vacuum is much less. The fact

is that all the well-known observed QED eﬀects (Lamb shift, Casimer eﬀect, etc.) involve

interation of the vacuum ﬁeld with matter. With that in mind, we prefer to use atomic

units (¯h = M = e = 1 [4], where M and e refer to the mass and charge of the electron,

respectively).
In these units, consistent with the fact that the atomic unit of velocity is
2.1877 × 108cm/s, we note that c = α−1 = 137.036, where α is the ﬁne-structure constant.
Also, since (GM 2/e2) = 2.401 × 10−43, we see that in these units G = 2.401 × 10−43 =
1.309 α20. We note that α is the natural expansion parameter in QED. Thus, in atomic

units (a.u.), (2) and (3) simply become

Ωp = α−5/2 G−1/2(a.u.) = 0.874 α−25/2 = 4.49 × 1026.

(0.5)

Thus, from (4) and (5), we obtain

< ρP >= 2 × 1098a.u. = 1.2 × 1096g/cm3.

This is to be compared with the measured vacuum energy density [1]

< ρv >≈ 10−29g/cm3 = 1.63 × 10−27a.u.

In other words, < ρP > is too large by a factor of the order of 10125. This discrepancy

is clearly unrealistically too large and we wish to explore how it may be reduced. In that

context, we note that to get agreement between the theoretical value given in (4) and the
observed value given in (7) requires an Ω value as low as 2.4 × 10−5.

First, we recall an exact calculation which we carried out to obtain, within the framework

of QED, the equation of motion of a radiating electron [5, 6]. Our analysis led to an explicit

result for Ω given by

where m is the bare mass, M is the renormalized (physical) mass, and

Ω =

0 ≤ m ≤ M,

In addition, a striking feature of our calculation was the conclusion that causality consider-

ations (which, in essence, state that eﬀect follows cause and which lead to the technical fact

that the poles of the electron response function must lie in the lower half-plane [7, 8]) dictate

that Ω has a well-deﬁned upper limit. We note that the limit m = 0 corresponds to the
largest cut-oﬀ value consistent with causality (Ω = τ −1

e ). Thus, causality puts a restriction

on the maximum value of Ω. This choice had the virtue of corresponding to an electron of

minimum size and it led to a simple second-order equation for the radiating electron, which

3

was free of runaway solutions [6, 9]. However, with respect to how large m is compared to

M, as Feynman [10], among others, has noted it ”- - cannot be determined theoretically”.

However, taking into account retardation and relativistic eﬀects, most estimates [11] con-

clude that m ≈ (1 − α)M. Substituting this result in (8) leads to the conclusion that the

cut-oﬀ, ΩQED say, is given by

ΩQED ≈ α τ −1

e =

α−2 = 2.82 × 104,

(0.10)

which is close to the value chosen by Bethe in his calculation of the Lamb shift. From (5), we
see that this is smaller than Ωp by a factor ≈ 1.72 α21/2 = 6.29 × 10−23. Recalling, from (4),
that < ρ >∼ Ω4, we see that this choice reduces < ρ > by a factor of 8.75 α42 = 1.57×10−89,
to now give a vaccum energy density which is about 1036 times too large. How can this

discrepancy be reduced further? Based on these numbers, one might expect that the energy

contributed to the vacuum by the zero-point ﬂuctuations occurs because of the interaction

between these ﬂuctuations and matter and not by consideration of these ﬂuctuations in

isolation. Clearly, more detailed work needs to be carried out but we feel that the reduction in

the discrepancy between observations and theory which stem from the above considerations

motivates more detailed analysis.

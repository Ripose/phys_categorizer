Virtual Replica of Matter in Bivacuum
&
Possible Mechanism of Distant
Mind - Matter and Mind - Mind Interaction

Alex Kaivarainen
H2o@karelia.ru
http://www.karelia.ru/˜alexk

The original mechanism of bivacuum mediated Mind-Matter and Mind-
Mind interaction, proposed here is based on the following stages of long term
eﬀorts (http://arXiv.org/ﬁnd/physics/1/au:+Kaivarainen A/0/1/0/all/0/1).
- New dynamic models of bivacuum, sub-elementary particles and corpuscle-

wave [C-W] duality, as a background of Superuniﬁcation;

- New Hierarchic theory of liquids and solids, veriﬁed on examples of

water and ice;

- New Hierarchic model of elementary act of consciousness, based on

microtubules of distant neurons exchange interaction;

- Virtual Replica (VR) of matter, including living organisms in bivacuum;
- The distant resonant [Mind-Bivacuum-Matter] and [Mind-Bivacuum-
Mind] interaction, mediated by Bivacuum oscillation (BvO) with Golden
mean frequency, accompanied by virtual particles/antiparticles pressure os-
cillation. The latter factor is related to oscillation of vacuum permittivity
(ε0) and permeability (µ0). These kinds of interaction may be realized also
by modulation of energy of neutrino or antineutrino and [neutrino ⇋ an-
tineutrino] equilibrium.

Our theory of Superuniﬁcation is based on new models of bivacuum, neu-
trino/antineutrino, sub-elementary particles, their self-assembly to particles
and [corpuscle(C) ⇋ wave(W )] duality.
It elucidates the quantum back-
ground of non-locality, principle of Least Action and Golden mean, uniﬁes
the quantum and relativist theories. Bivacuum is considered as two nonmix-
ing superﬂuid oceans of subquantum particles of positive (real) and negative
(mirror) energy. The primordial bivacuum in the absence of matter and ﬁelds
is symmetric in contrast to secondary one.

It is shown, that self-organization and evolution of systems at huge range
of scales:
from microscopic to cosmic ones - drives them to Golden Mean
conditions under the inﬂuence of Bivacuum oscillations (BvO) with Golden
Mean (GM) frequencies. This occur, as a result of tending of [C ⇋ W ]
pulsation of matter elementary particles to resonance with fundamental (GM)
0c2/~), of BvO. The principle of Least action can be a
frequencies (ωi
consequence of corresponding ”Harmonization” driving force of bivacuum.

The virtual replica (VR) of condensed matter (living organisms
in private case), may inﬂuence the properties of uncompensated
(eﬀective) virtual pressure of asymmetric bivacuum in following
manner:

1) changing the amplitude of virtual pressure waves (VPW) in-phase with
Bivacuum oscillations (BvO). This factor is dependent on fraction of coherent
particles in system with in-phase [C ⇋ W ] transitions. The important role
of Mind-Matter and Mind-Mind interaction is related to coherent fraction
of water in microtubules in state of mesoscopic molecular Bose condensate.
This fraction is a variable parameter, dependent on kind of elementary act
of consciousness and number of simultaneous acts;

2) changing bivacuum symmetry shift, related to [BV F ↑ ⇋ BV F ↓] ≡
[neutrino ⇋ antineutrino] equilibrium shift,
induced by magnetic ﬁeld
of matter variation. Decreasing/increasing of the vacuum symmetry shift
will be accompanied by decreasing/increasing of the eﬀective uncompensated
VPW energy;

3) shifting the Golden mean resonance conditions of [matter - bivacuum]
interaction by exchange of BvO, as a result of spatial perturbation of matter,
changing the frequency of [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of its elementary particles.
This factor may increase or decrease the amplitude of BvO and, consequently,
the amplitude of virtual pressure waves (VPW).

Key words: vacuum, duality, Superuniﬁcation, act of conscious-
ness, virtual replica, Golden mean, bivacuum oscillations, Mind-
Matter and Mind-Mind interaction.

I. New Model of Bivacuum

Our Dynamic model of Corpuscle -Wave [C ⇋ W] duality is based on
the new notion of bivacuum. We postulate the existence of POSITIVE (real)
and NEGATIVE (mirror) vacuum as two non mixing ’oceans’ of superﬂuid
liquid, formed by virtual sub-quantum particles of the opposite energies.
The uniﬁed system of positive (real) and negative (mirror) vacuum is termed:
BIVACUUM. It is assumed to be an inﬁnitive source of bivacuum fermions
with positive (BVF↑
S=−1/2) half-integer spins and
bivacuum bosons (BVB±
S=0) of two possible polarization (±) and zero spin.
The (BVF↑) and (BVF↓) are introduced in our model as a correlated pairs
of in-phase circulations of quantum liquid, but in two opposite directions:
i.e. clockwise and anticlockwise (⇈ and (cid:21)), like:

S=1/2) and negative (BVF↓

BV F ↑

(S=1/2) = [real rotor (V +

↑ ) + mirror rotor (V −

↑ )] ≡ [V + ⇈ V −]

(1)

2

and:

BV F ↓

(S=−1/2) = [real antirotor (V +

↓ ) + mirror antirotor (V +

↓ )] ≡ [V + (cid:21) V −]
(2)

correspondingly.

For the other hand, the (BVB±) of two possible polarization: (+) and (−)

is formed by the pair of counter phase real and mirror circulations:

BV B±

S=0 = [real rotor (V +

l ) + mirror antirotor (V −

l )] ≡ [V + l V −]

(3)

The BVB± with properties of Falaco soliton (Kiehn, 1998) is the interme-

diate transition state between (BVF↑) and (BVF↓):

BV F ↑

(S=1/2) ⇋ BV B±

S=0 ⇋ BV F ↓

(S=−1/2)

1.1. Quantization of bivacuum

The energies of real and mirror rotors, forming bivacuum fermions (BV F l)
and bivacuum bosons (BV B±) are quantized as quantum harmonic oscilla-
tors of positive and negative energy:

It leads from our theory, that the values of mi

V = ~/m−

The symmetric bivacuum (in absence of vacuum symmetry shift) is char-
acterized by the equality of resulting energy of bivacuum fermions and bi-
vacuum bosons to zero:

It follows from our theory, that in secondary vacuum, existing in pres-

However, the diﬀerence between sublevels of positive and negative vac-
uum sublevels (energetic gaps) is independent on vacuum symmetry shift.
This fact is responsible for keeping permanent the quantized frequencies of
Bivacuum oscillations (BvO), radiating/absorbing as a result transitions be-
tween corresponding sublevels (section 1.4).

1.2. Neutrino and antineutrino: what is it ?

Neutrino and antineutrino are the neutral fermions with opposite spins
(spirality) and very small (or even zero) mass, propagating in vacuum with
light velocity. Due to neutrality and small probability of scattering any kind
of screens are transparent for neutrino/antineutrino.

We suppose that the uncompensated BV F ↑ and BV F ↓, originated
from the equilibrium (4) shift to the left or to the right, correspondingly,
may represent three generations of neutrino and antineutrino:
the
electron’s (νe,
ντ ). Their energy
and eﬀective mass are directly related to zero-point mass of the electrons of
corresponding generation: (m0)e,µ,τ and may be quantized in similar way like
(4a and 4b):

Consequently, neutrinos (νe,µ,τ ) and antineutrinos (

tain perturbations of bivacuum symmetry (nonlocal or almost nonlocal) of

In the interaction of neutrino with real target - only vortices (V +) of
uncompensated BVF↑ (eq.1), corresponding to real positive energy of bivac-
uum, may be eﬀective.

It is shown, that the internal velocity of circulation of sub-quantum par-
ticles, forming vorticities [V + and V −]e,µ,τ , of superﬂuid bivacuum is luminal
(Kaivarainen, 2000).

The external resulting impulses (momentum) of all of three kind of sym-
metric bivacuum excitations: PBVB±, PBVF↑ and PBVF↓ are equal to zero,

5

as far their external group velocity is zero. This means that external vir-
tual wave B length of these excitations, as a ratio of Plank constant to their
impulse is tending to inﬁnity:

BC= h/Pext
λext

BV B±, BV F l → ∞

(9)

It is shown in our work, using Virial theorem, that corresponding to
(9) inﬁnive virtual Bose condensation (BC) of bivacuum, where λext is a
parameter of order, coincide with condition of nonlocality. We deﬁne non-
locality, as independence of any potential in BC (real or virtual) on distance:
V (r) = const.

Deviation of secondary vacuum from ideal symmetry (8a) leads to Pext
0 and disassembly of inﬁnitive virtual BC to huge, but ﬁnite virtual BC:
BC= h/Pext

BC are dependent on potentials
of gravitational, electromagnetic and torsion ﬁelds.

The rotors (V +

↓) in realms of positive (real) and negative (mirror) vacuum, are separated
from each other by quantized energetic gap, the same (or very close)

from transitions between the ground gap with n = 0 and n = 1, 2, 3...

particles (three generation of the electrons and positrons (e, µ, τ ), quarks,
etc.):

The symmetric bivacuum excitations: BVB±, BVF↑ and BVF↓ may have
a broad spectra of energetic gaps and related radiuses (from microscopic to
cosmic ones), determined by the eﬀective mass of excitations (m+
V and m−
V )
in 4a and 4b and corresponding resonant frequencies (2n ωi

0).

The vacuum symmetry shift (6) in the presence of matter or ﬁelds is not
accompanied by BvO symmetry perturbation as far the diﬀerence between
sublevels remains unchanged. However, the frequency and amplitude of BvO
may be modulated by vibro-gravitational waves (VGW), excited by collective
particle oscillations (see section 4.4).

The virtual particles and antiparticles [origination ⇋ annihilation] is a
result of correlated transitions between rotors in realms of positive and neg-
, correspond-
and
ative energy:

tum transitions occur between BV B±
and

sponsible for virtual particles and antiparticles (virtual bosons and fermions)

In private case, when k = 0 the (eq.14) turns to formula for basic BvO

(12).

Virtual pressure, related to virtual particles and those, related
to antiparticles totally compensate each other in condition of pri-
mordial bivacuum, when vacuum symmetry shift is zero. However,
in secondary bivacuum, in presence of matter and ﬁelds when in-
equality (6) take a place, such compensation is broken and pressure
of virtual particles or antiparticles becomes nonzero. This displays,
for example, in Casimir eﬀect.

Propagation of BvO of resonant amplitude, accompanied by virtual par-
ticles and antiparticles origination and annihilation, occur in bivacuum with
velocity, limited by the life-times of corresponding virtual particles/antiparticles.

7

The relation between the life time of virtual pair (∆t) and energy of pair
(∆Aj,k

BvO) is determined by uncertainty principle:

∆t ∆Aj,k

BvO ≥ ~

(15)

The nonresonant sub-quantum BvO in bivacuum virtual Bose
condensate, unable to excite BVFl of BVB± to next quantum state,
are nondissipative and nonlocal.

At certain quantum boundary conditions, satisfying the conservation laws,
the transaction between emitter and absorber of nonlocal BvO via bivac-
uum may lead to system of standing BvO origination (Cramer, 1988).

2. Origination of matter as a result of bivacuum symmetry shift.
2.1. Sub-elementary particles and antiparticles

Our model postulates, that the sub-elementary particles and sub-
elementary antiparticles in corpuscular [C] phase represent the asymmet-

dynamic pair: [real vortex + mirror rotor] (Kaivarainen, 2000).

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

The real inertial (m+

C) mass are the result of bi-
vacuum symmetry shift, accompanied by sub-elementary particle or sub-
elementary antiparticle origination. The latter is dependent on the sign of
shift.

The asymmetrically excited bivacuum bosons:

shift, produced by the uncompensated sub-elementary particle. Deviation
of total compensation increases with particle velocity and ﬁelds tension, in-
creasing symmetry shift.

The positron may be presented as asymmetric form of the electron (18),

or/and τ ) like structures:

d = [(e− + e−) + e+]µ,τ

Z = −1/3

(18d)

It is supposed, that each uncompensated sub-elementary fermions/antifermion

of quarks has elementary charge: ±Z = ±1/3.

It leads from our model, that elementary particles with fermion properties
are composed from non equal number of sub-elementary particles and with
boson properties - from their equal number.

For example photon, resulting from annihilation of the electron with
positron may be considered as a system of three pairs of sub-elementary
fermions and antifermions:

photon = 3[F−

The symmetry of our bivacuum as respect to probability of ele-
mentary particles and antiparticles origination, makes it principally
diﬀerent from asymmetric Dirac’s vacuum, with its realm of nega-
tive energy saturated with electrons. Positrons in his model represent
the ’holes’, originated as a result of the electrons jumps in realm of positive
energy.

2.2. Dynamic model of Corpuscle⇋Wave: [C⇋W] duality

I supposed, that duality do not display itself, depending simply on the
experimental way of particle detection, when both propertied are embedded
in particle permanently, as it was generally accepted. In my model it is
assumed, that the corpuscular [C] and wave [W] phases of sub-elementary
particles/antiparticles represent two alternative phase of de Broglie wave
(wave B), which are in dynamic equilibrium (Kaivarainen, 1993, 1995, 2000).
The frequency of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation (ωB) is equal to frequency of
l and symmetric (BVFl)

quantum beats between asymmetric (BVFl)∗ ≡ F±
states of bivacuum sub-elementary fermions (F−

↑ ) and antifermions (F+
↓ ).

The energy of [C] phase, deﬁned by this frequency, is a sum of energies
of real (EC+) and mirror (EC−) corpuscular states of asymmetrically excited
bivacuum fermion (Fl).

For example:

EC = E(V +

l )∗ + EV −

l

=

(19)

where: EC+ corresponds to energy of excited rotor (V +

l )∗; EC− corre-
l )∗ the

(20)

or the asymmetric sub-elementary antifermion:

(F +

↑ ) ≡ [(V +

l )∗ + (V −
l )]

(F −

↓ ) ≡ [(V −

l )∗ + (V +
l )]

The energy of [W] phase of (F +

↑ ), existing in form of cumulative
virtual cloud (CVC), is deﬁned as the energy of transition between rotors
in excited real (V+

l )∗ and ground (V+

l ) states:

EW = E(V +

l )∗ − EV +

l

It is equal to energy of [C] phase (EC). Consequently, the energy of both
phase: [C] and [W] are equal to energy of wave B: EB = EC = EW ≡ ECV C
.

Corresponding transition state between real [C+] and mirror [C−] states

represents cumulative virtual cloud (CVC) of subquantum particles, forming
superﬂuid vacuum.

It may be shown from canonical representation of (23c) and (23d), that
spatial image, corresponding to real [C+] state is equilateral hyperbola
and spatial image of mirror [C−] state of [C] phase is a circle.

Spatial image of CVC, corresponding to [W] phase, considered as a dif-
ference between images of [C+] and [C−] states is a parted (two-cavity)
hyperboloid (Kaivarainen, 2000).

The restoration of [C] - PHASE in form of [real + mirror] mass-dipole is a
result of binding of CVC to BVF in ground state, accompanied by asymmetric
excitation of bivacuum fermion:

. This [W → C] transition is totally reversible with the opposite one [C →

Oscillations between [C] and [W] phase of wave B are accompanied by oscil-
lations of kinetic energy and time, in accordance to our theory of time (see

Propagation of fermion in bivacuum in a course of [C ⇋ W ] cycling
is a jump-way process, termed ’kangaroo eﬀect’, because the [W] phase is
luminal in contrast to sub-luminal [C] phase. Our model uniﬁes electromag-
netic and gravitational potentials of elementary charge (electron) with its
real kinetic energy (equal to energy of CVC) and bivacuum symmetry shift
in very clear way.

The bunched character of the electron’s trajectory can be a result of

is accompanied by outgoing and incoming Cumulative Virtual Cloud (CVC).
Another possible explanation of bunched trajectory of the electron is the

interaction of pair

may be generated also by [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of other particles, including
those of two-slit screen. The energy of resonant bivacuum BvO (ABvO, see

2.4. The electric and magnetic components of electromagnetic
charge

The CVC, representing [W] phase is composed from Virtual Density
Waves (VDW), responsible for electric component (i) of elementary electro-
magnetic charge and from Virtual Symmetry Waves (VSW), related to
magnetic component (η) of resulting elementary charge. In contrast to VDW,
accompanied by real energy reversible change (eq.27c), the VSW (eq.27d) are
excited by oscillations of negative mirror energy in a course of [C ⇋ W ] pul-
sation. We relate (i) to real mass (m+
C). The
product of two components is equal to resulting charge squared

C ) and (η) to mirror mass (m−

i × η = e2 = α~c

(28)

The electromagnetic ﬁne structure constant is: α = e2/~c = e2/Q2,

where the total charge we deﬁne like: Q = (~c)1/2.

2.5. Uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and gravitation
(Kaivarainen, 2000; 2001)

We deﬁne the maximum of electromagnetic potential as the inter-
nal interaction energy between electric and magnetic fractions of elementary
charge on the distance, determined by the mass-dipole radius (26):

form of CVC, determined by electromagnetic ﬁne structure constant (α) as
a factor, is responsible for [Emax

el
mined by its Compton radius.

We assume that the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials de-

creases with distance (R) like:

where −→r is the unitary radius-vector.
For the case of macroscopic body as a system of interacting atoms and
molecules, the translational and rotational contributions should be subdi-
vided to internal (microscopic) and external (macroscopic) subcontributions.

rot), will have

The contribution of internal translational and rotational (librational) dy-
namics may be comparable or bigger than the external ones. Our theory
predicts that the increasing of temperature of solid body may increase its
gravitational potential due to activation of thermal dynamics of atoms and
molecules.

For the other hand, interaction of molecules of body with electromagnetic
ﬁeld (photons), increasing their polarizability and, consequently, Van der
Waals interactions, will reduce molecular thermal dynamics and the internal
kinetic energy of body.
It should reduce also its gravitational potential.
There are some experimental evidence, pointing, that the above predictions
of my theory are right.

This shift is accompanied by the local [BV F ↑ ⇋ BV F ↓] equilibrium shift,

leading to similar shift of [neutrino ⇋ antineutrino].

It means that local gravitational potential may be regulated by torsion
(spin) ﬁeld, inﬂuencing on vacuum symmetry shift, as a result of rotational
kinetic energy of particle or system of particles change in accordance to (31d).

In our approach, the spin (torsion) ﬁeld (

as a part of gravitational ﬁeld, dependent on rotational kinetic energy of
body (internal and external).

Contribution of magnetic ﬁeld to resulting gravitational potential, deﬁned
by (33), may have the opposite sign, than [Etr
G ]in,ext. It means, that
magnetic ﬁeld, generated by body, may inﬂuence its gravitational potential
and eﬀective mass, changing EG. This important result of our theory is
in total accordance with Searl eﬀect, conﬁrmed in experiments of de Palma,
Baurov (1998), Roshin and Godin (2000). These experiments and our theory
point to possibility of extraction of ’free’ energy from secondary bivacuum
due to its symmetry shift. The symmetry shift of primordial bivacuum
in the absence of matter and ﬁelds is zero in accordance to our theory (see
section 1.1).

The Einstein’s theory of general relativity did not take into account such
factors as body rotation, its internal dynamics and generated by body mag-
netic ﬁeld.

2.6. Interrelation between hidden and external parameters of
elementary particles.

at Golden mean condition is determined by the rest mass of elementary
particle:

0 = m0c2/~
ωS

(40)

We deﬁne this fundamental frequency of elementary particles pulsation

as Golden mean frequency.

For m0, equal to mass of rest of the electron, the Golden mean frequency
is: ω0 = 9.03 · 1020 s−1. For quarks it is about three order higher. The latter
is close to Golden mean frequency of τ −electrons, as a possible components
of quarks in form of corresponding standing waves.

also change in corresponding way at Hidden Harmony conditions:

3. Bivacuum - Matter Interaction
3.1. Inﬂuence of bivacuum quantum oscillations on matter
properties

We put forward a hypothesis, that any kind of selected system, able
to self-assembly, self-organization and evolution:
from atoms to
living organisms and from galactics to Universe - are tending to
condition of Hidden Harmony (28), displaying in Golden Mean re-
alization. Corresponding driving force may be named ”Harmonization
Force (HF)”. This force is a consequence of minimization of diﬀerence be-
tween external and internal action, i.e. minimization of resulting action:

particle:

Consequently, condition (43) may be achieved only by change of external
kinetic energy: m+

nization force, in accordance to our theory, is related to interaction of sub-
systems: bivacuum and matter due to inﬂuence of Bivacuum oscillations
(BvO) with basic frequencies (ωi
0), deﬁned by the rest mass of elementary
particles (eq. 13), on frequency of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of elementary particles,
forming matter. Under the permanent action of BvO synchronization of total
system [bivacuum + matter] occur. It is shown in theory of autooscillations
of nonlinear systems with many degrees of freedom (matter in our case), that
the resonance may take a place not only at the equality of external frequency
B = ωi
(ωi

of [C ⇋ W ] pulsation, but at following combinations of external and internal
frequencies:

0 of BvO in our case) and internal Golden mean frequency (ωi

(45)

The resonant energy exchange between interacting elements of nonlinear
systems with many degrees of freedom, i.e. between nuclears and electrons,
atoms and molecules may occur. The energy exchange between diﬀerent
degrees of freedom at resonance conditions may be displayed in coherent
change of external kinetic energy of clusters of atoms and molecules and
ﬁnally in acceleration of even macroscopic bodies, if the amplitude of BvO is
big enough. The latter may be achieved as a result of bivacuum transitons
excitation by the curled magnetic ﬁeld, like in Searl eﬀect (Roshin and Godin,
2000).

Except the deﬁnite relations between the frequency of external and in-
ternal frequencies (31), the resonant excitation of system (matter) needs
certain geometrical conditions, which exclude possible compensation of
the external ﬁeld action by diﬀerent elements of this system. The latter con-
ditions means that resonant interaction of BvO with macromolecules, like
DNA and proteins, as well as with macroscopic systems may direct the evo-
lution of such systems geometry to Golden mean, inducing the changes of not
only in their dynamics, but also of spatial parameters. Certain demands to
three-dimensional parameters of systems with dissipation, interacting with
BvO, may be determined by the autooscillations regime conditions.

The described directed inﬂuence of Bivacuum oscillations with funda-
mental frequencies (ωi
0) on elementary particles, their assembles in form of
atoms and molecules, aﬀecting the dynamics and geometry of microscopic,
mesoscopic and macroscopic systems - could be a physical background

20

for realization of Principle of Least Action.

3.2. Uniﬁcation a of Electromagnetism and Gravitation with
Time, Space and Mass

Analysis of principle of Least action in Lagrange form and principle of
uncertainty in coherent form for free particle (V = 0) leads us to formulation
of pace of time (dt/t = d ln t) as a measure of the system’s real kinetic energy
pace of change:

d ln t = −d ln Tkin = d ln m+

C + 2d ln L+

(46)

where the real kinetic energy T +

kin = ~2/2m+

CL2 is related with space

parameter - the radius of wave B length as: L+ = ~/m+
Cv

It is easy to show, that at permanent velocity v = const, the real mass
C and real space L+ are also constant and, consequently, the time: t =

m+
const.

Increasing of wave B length of elementary systems (particles) means in-
creasing the probability of their Bose condensation and uniﬁcation. At crit-
ical values of wave B length, the process, like 1st order phase transition of
matter, takes a place (Kaivarainen, 1995, 2000).

Taking into account (29) and (31), we get from (46) simple, symmetric
and very important formula of uniﬁcation of temporal ﬁeld
change of any closed system with changes of its electromagnetic
and gravitational potential, mass and space:

d ln t = −d ln Tkin = −d ln Eel = −d ln EG = d ln m+

C + 2d ln L+

(47)

Resistance of Bivacuum Symmetry to Perturbation, as Reason of

The inertial property of real mass (m+

C) of [C] phase in our model is a
consequence of bivacuum symmetry reaction to real kinetic energy increasing
(m+
C v2) and corresponding increasing of CVC energy of [W] phase, necessary
to keep [C ⇋ W ] equilibrium. Such tendency to keep dynamic [C ⇋ W ]
equilibrium of sub-elementary particles, corresponding to certain bivacuum
symmetry shift, in spite of external perturbation of this equilibrium, we
termed generalized principle of Le Chatelier (Kaivarainen, 2000).

The bivacuum symmetry resistance to perturbation, responsible for in-
ertia, is a distant, but not nonlocal eﬀect. In contrast to nonlocal Mach’s

Inertia

21

principle, our theory explains the existence of inertial mass even for only
one particle in the empty Universe. We do not need to apply in our the-
ory to mass producing Higgs-like ﬁelds also. The equality of inertial and
gravitational mass leads naturally from our theory of gravitation and inertial
mass.

4. Inﬂuence of Matter on Bivacuum Properties.
4.1. Positive and negative Casimir eﬀects, Virtual Jet Generator

The decreasing of bivacuum virtual pressure in space between
close and parallel conducting plates, as respect to virtual pressure
outside the plates, explains the Casimir attractive (positive) ef-
fect.
Increasing the Bivacuum oscillations (BvO) symmetry and making
them more coherent in space between plates may be induced by the
coherent [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of the electrons of conducting plates.

It leads to decreasing of probability of uncompensated (asymmetric) vir-
tual transitons (VT) excitation. This determines the eﬀective value of den-
sity/pressure of virtual particles or antiparticles between conducting plates.
In contrast to this situation, it is known that cavities with some special
geometry, like two close hemispheres - increase the probability of virtual par-
ticles and antiparticles origination in bivacuum, leading to repulsion between
hemispheres (Lamoreaux, 1997). We termed like phenomena as negative
Casimir eﬀect (Kaivarainen, 2000).

It was supposed, that each of two hemispheres or other asym-
metric structures, like open cones, pyramids, etc. may serve as
Virtual Jet Generators (VJG), increasing the uncompensated frac-
tion of virtual pressure (VP). If so, they may be used for extrac-
tion of free energy from bivacuum and propulsion in bivacuum
(Kaivarainen, 2000; 2001). Consequently, between subsystems: bivacuum
and matter the feedback reaction is existing.

4.2. Virtual replica (VR) of condensed matter

Three contributions to Virtual Replica (VR), generated by mat-

ter, are introduced:

1) local - electromagnetic contribution in form of IR photons radiation of
any bodies with absolute temperature T >0). This contribution is dissipating
quickly with distance;

2) distant - vibro-gravitational in form of modulated resonant Bivacuum
oscillations (BvO), generated the virtual pressure waves (VPW). Another
distant factors of VR are modulated energy of neutrino, as uncompensated

Corresponding equilibrium may be modulated by vibro-gravitational and

magnetic ﬁeld of matter;

3) nonlocal contribution to VR may be related to nonresonant pertur-
bation of Bivacuum oscillations (BvO) without changing the scale of Virtual
Bose Condensate, formed by BVF and BVB.

The second and third type of VR represent superposition of N-dimensional
standing vibro-gravitational waves (VGW) and modulated VPW, correspond-
ingly. The N is a number of virtual degrees of freedom in bivacuum, excited
by matter in bivacuum. Consequently, VR has the N-dimensional hologram
properties. In this point our theory is close to ideas, developed by Bohm.

At resonant conditions BvO are responsible for energy, density of virtual
particles (virtual transitons) and virtual pressure, providing the feedback
inﬂuence of BVR on matter, including living organisms. All kinds of BVR

resulting virtual pressure of bivacuum, generated by gravitating body. Ro-
tation of this body will increase the above eﬀect as a result its particles
kinetic energy increasing.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld, generated by rotating body may increase
the probability of transitions between bivacuum energy sublevels, density of
virtual particles/antiparticles and resulting (noncompensated) virtual pres-
sure around the body.

Our notion of bivacuum symmetry shift and its consequences have some
similarity with notion of Polarizable Vacuum (PV), introduced by Puthoﬀ
(1999). The PV approach means, in principle, the possibility of space-time
metric ”engineering” by changing vacuum permittivity: ε0 → Kε0 and per-
meability: µ0 → Kµ0 , where K is a variable vacuum dielectric constant
(Puthoﬀ, Little and Ibison, 2000). If K >1 (K ≈ 1 + 2GM/rc2
in solar
system), this decreases the values of light velocity, frequency of photons, en-
ergy, length, pace of time and increases the mass of body, as respect to the
values of same parameters of body in the absence of gravitational ﬁeld, when
K = 1.

In terms of our theory K > 1,corresponds to positive vacuum symmetry
shift and K = 1 corresponds to vacuum symmetry shift equal to zero. At
condition K < 1 (negative vacuum symmetry shift) all the above listed
parameters, related to space-time metric, change in opposite direction as
respect to K > 1.

that each of 24 collective quantum excitations, introduced in new theory, is
characterized by speciﬁc coherent oscillations and corresponding averaged
kinetic energy (T i
kin). Each of these contributions to resulting gravitational
potential may be evaluated separately. Our Hierarchic theory of condensed
matter in combination with described model of duality allows the quantita-
tive evaluation of distant component of vacuum replica: Vibro - Gravitational
Replica (VGR).

4.3. Main features of Hierarchic theory of condensed matter

anharmonic oscillations of particles in any condensed matter lead to emer-
gence of three-dimensional (3D) superposition of standing de Broglie waves of
molecules, electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Consequently, any condensed
matter could be considered as a gas of 3D standing waves of corresponding
nature. Our approach uniﬁes and develops strongly the Einstein’s and De-
bye’s models.

24

It leads from our Hierarchic theory of condensed matter (see http://arXiv.org/abs/physics/0003044

Collective excitations in form of coherent clusters, representing at certain
conditions the mesoscopic molecular Bose condensate, were analyzed, as a
background of hierarchic model of condensed matter.

The most probable de Broglie wave (wave B) length is determined by the
ratio of Plank constant to the most probable impulse of molecules or by ratio
of its most probable phase velocity to frequency. The waves B are related to
molecular translations (tr ) and librations (lb). As the quantum dynamics
of condensed matter does not follow in general case the classical Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution, the real most probable de Broglie wave length can
exceed the classical thermal de Broglie wave length and the distance between
centers of molecules many times. This makes possible the atomic and
molecular mesoscopic Bose condensation in solids and liquids at
temperatures, below boiling point.
It is one of the most important
results of new theory, which we have conﬁrmed by computer simulations
on examples of water and ice and the Virial theorem. Four strongly in-
terrelated new types of quasiparticles (collective excitations) were
introduced in our hierarchic model:

1. Eﬀectons (tr and lb), existing in ”acoustic” (a) and ”optic” (b) states

represent the coherent clusters in general case;

2 Convertons, corresponding to interconversions between tr and lb types

of the eﬀectons (ﬂickering clusters);

3. Transitons are the intermediate [a ⇋ b] transition states of the tr and

lb eﬀectons;

4. Deformons are the 3D superposition of IR electromagnetic or acoustic

waves, activated by transitons and [lb ⇋ tr] convertons.

Primary eﬀectons (tr and lb) are formed by 3D superposition of the
most probable standing de Broglie waves of the oscillating ions, atoms or
molecules. The volume of eﬀectons (tr and lb) may contain from less than
one, to tens and even thousands of molecules. The ﬁrst condition means
validity of classical approximation in description of the subsystems of the
eﬀectons. The second one points to quantum properties of coherent clusters
due to molecular Bose condensation.

It leads from our computer simulations, that liquids are semiclassical
systems because their primary (tr) eﬀectons contain less than one molecule
and primary (lb) eﬀectons - more than one molecule. The solids are quan-
tum systems totally because both kind of their primary eﬀectons (tr and lb)
are mesoscopic molecular Bose condensates. It is shown, that the 1st order
[gas → liquid] transition is accompanied by strong decrease of librational
(rotational) degrees of freedom due to emergence of primary (lb) eﬀectons.
In turn, the [liquid → solid] transition is followed by decreasing of transla-

25

tional degrees of freedom due to molecular mesoscopic Bose-condensation in
form of primary (tr) eﬀectons.

In the general case the eﬀecton can be approximated by paral-
lelepiped with edges corresponding to de Broglie waves length in
three selected directions (1, 2, 3), related to the symmetry of the
molecular dynamics.

The in-phase oscillations of molecules in the eﬀectons correspond to the
eﬀecton’s (a) - acoustic state and the counterphase oscillations correspond to
their (b) - optic state. States (a) and (b) of the eﬀectons diﬀer in potential
energy only, however, their kinetic energies, impulses and spatial dimensions
- are the same. The (a → b) or (b → a) transition states of the primary
eﬀectons (tr and lb), deﬁned as primary transitons, are accompanied by a
change in molecule polarizability and dipole moment without density ﬂuc-
In this case the transitions lead to absorption or radiation of IR

photons, respectively.

Superposition of three internal standing IR photons, penetrating in dif-
ferent directions (1,2,3) - forms primary electromagnetic deformons (tr and
lb). On the other hand, the [lb⇋ tr] convertons and secondary transitons are
accompanied by the density ﬂuctuations, leading to absorption or radiation
of phonons.

Superposition of standing phonons in three directions (1,2,3), forms sec-
ondary acoustic deformons (tr and lb). Correlated collective excitations
of primary and secondary eﬀectons and deformons (tr and lb), localized in
the volume of primary tr and lb electromagnetic deformons, lead to origina-
tion of macroeﬀectons, macrotransitons and macrodeformons (tr and
lb respectively).

Correlated simultaneous excitations of tr and lb macroeﬀectons in the
volume of superimposed tr and lb electromagnetic deformons lead to orig-
ination of supereﬀectons.
In turn, the coherent excitation of both: tr
and lb macrodeformons and macroconvertons in the same volume means cre-
ation of superdeformons. Superdeformons are the biggest (cavitational)
ﬂuctuations, leading to microbubbles in liquids and to local defects in solids.
Total number of quasiparticles of condensed matter equal to 4!=24, re-
ﬂects all of possible combinations of the four basic ones [1-4], introduced
above. This set of collective excitations - is proved to be able to explain
virtually all the properties of condensed matter. It is quantitatively veriﬁed
on examples of water and ice in wide T-interval: 5-373 K, using new the-
ory based computer program (copyright, 1997, Kaivarainen). Our hierarchic
concept creates a bridge between micro- and macro- phenomena, dynamics
and thermodynamics, liquids and solids in terms of quantum physics.

sidered in our Hierarchic theory of condensed matter (Kaivarainen, 2000b),
the averaged thermal vibrations contribution to gravitational potential of
particles, can be evaluated:

The equation for total internal kinetic energy of condensed matter is a
sum of contributions of each of 24 excitation. It may be calculated, using
our computer program (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2000a).

The most eﬀective source of vibro-gravitational waves (VGW) are coher-
ent clusters, existing in liquids (librational primary eﬀectons) and solids
(librational and translational primary eﬀectons) as a result of high -
temperature mesoscopic Bose condensation. Primary transitons, represent-
ing transition state between optic (b) and acoustic (a) modes of the primary
eﬀectons and convertons - transition states between primary librational
and translational eﬀectons also may generate VGW and vibro-gravitational
replica (VGR) in bivacuum. Due to coherency of VGW, excited in bivacuum
by listed kind of excitations, they may form a hologram-like system of stand-
ing waves - VGR. Other excitations of condensed matter are not so coherent.
Their VGW can not form standing waves and their VGR are not stable. This
means that corresponding ’memory’ of bivacuum is very short.

Taking this into account, the energy of vibro-gravitational waves (as a
part of CVC energy), generated by one mole of condensed matter may be
calculated (Kaivarainen, 2000a):

condensed matter. It reﬂects the matter dynamic properties. Any changes
of these properties are accompanied by change of VR, i.e. holomovement
after Bohm.

4 .5. Diﬀerent components of biological cells as a possible virtual
jet generators

Our Hierarchic Model of Consciousness - HMC (Kaivarainen, 2000c) is
based on Hierarchic theory of condensed matter (Kaivarainen, 1995; 2000b).
In accordance to this theory, coherent properties of water clusters in micro-
tubules (MT) and distant exchange by IR photons, radiated by these clusters
(mesoscopic molecular Bose condensate - MBC) may be responsible for dis-
tant interaction between MT of diﬀerent neurons and neuron ensembles with
similar orientation of MT.

In accordance to our HMC, each speciﬁc kind of neuron ensembles exci-
tation - corresponds to hierarchical system of three-dimensional (3D) stand-
ing waves of following interrelated kinds: thermal de Broglie waves (waves
B), produced by anharmonic vibrations of molecules; electromagnetic (IR)
waves; acoustic waves and vibro-gravitational waves (Kaivarainen, 2000b).
Corresponding complex hologram may be responsible for distant quantum
neurodynamics regulation and for morphogenetic ﬁeld.

In our model we consider quantum collective excitations, resulted from
coherent anharmonic translational and librational oscillations of water in the
hollow core of the microtubules. It was shown, that water fraction, related to
librations, represent mesoscopic molecular Bose condensate (MBC) in form
of coherent clusters. The dimensions of water clusters (nanometers) and
frequency of their IR radiation may be enhanced by interaction with walls of
MT. It is most organized and orchestrated fraction of condensed matter in
biological cells. The Brownian eﬀects, which inﬂuence reorientation of MT
system and probability of cavitational ﬂuctuations, stimulating [gel - sol]
transition in nerve cells - may be responsible for non-computational element
of consciousness. Other models (Wigner, 1955 and Penrose, 1994) relate this
element to wave function collapse.

Change of the ordered fraction of water in microtubules in form of MBC,
leads to [gel-sol] transition, related to reversible assembly - disassembly of
actin microﬁlaments, change of osmotic pressure, pulsation of cells volume
and membranes deformation. Corresponding ”holomovement” of Virtual
replica (VR) of living organism may be responsible for mind-matter in-
teraction, telepathy and other phenomena, related to parapsychology. The

29

bigger is number of MTs with similar orientation of coherently interacting
cells, the bigger is corresponding fraction of ordered water, very sensitive
to nerve excitation. There are evidence, pointing that spatial properties of
DNA and MTs follow the Golden mean rule (see web site of Dan Winter
http://www.danwinter.com/). In accordance to our results, it is a condition,
optimal for exchange interaction of matter with bivacuum by Bivacuum os-
cillations (BvO).

Consequently, DNA, chromosomes, microtubules and bunches of MTs
may serve as eﬀective virtual jet generators (VJG), increasing virtual pres-
sure in selected direction. It may be due to existing of librational eﬀectons
and high frequency conversions between librational and translational water
eﬀectons in MT. The collective contribution of MT, related to librational
kinetic energy of coherent water, in Virtual replica of living organisms
may be signiﬁcant. This contribution for one mole of water may be calculated
like (Kaivarainen, 2000):

The charged bilayer membranes of biological cells, including
neurons and axons have a properties of system of Casimir chambers
of variable geometry. At certain conditions (i.e. depolarization)
they may provide also the cumulative virtual jet eﬀect.

At the ”rest” condition of cells the resulting concentration of internal
anions of neurons is bigger than that of external ones, providing the diﬀerence
of potentials equal to 50-100mV. As far the thickness of membrane is only
about 5nm or 50˚A it means that the gradient of electric tension is about:

100. 000 V /sm

it is extremely high. Depolarization of membrane usually is related to
i.e.
penetration of Na+ ions into the cell. The processes of depolarization, ac-
companied by pulsation of nerve cell body, - change the properties of mem-
branes as Casimir chambers and, consequently, the virtual replica of cell.

The virtual replica of all cells, involved in nerve excitation, in-
cluding acupuncture points, change in-phase with corresponding
elementary acts of consciousness.

30

5. Possible mechanism of Bivacuum mediated Matter-Matter
and Mind-Matter interaction

The virtual replica (VR) of condensed matter (living organisms
in private case), may inﬂuence properties of uncompensated (eﬀec-
tive) virtual pressure in following ways:

1) changing the amplitude of virtual pressure waves (VPW) in-phase with
Bivacuum oscillations (BvO). This factor is dependent on fraction of coherent
particles in system with in-phase [C ⇋ W ] transitions. The important role
of Mind-Matter and Mind-Mind interaction is related to coherent fraction
of water in microtubules in state of mesoscopic molecular Bose condensate.
This fraction is a variable parameter, speciﬁc for kind of elementary act of
consciousness;

2) changing bivacuum symmetry shift, related to [BV F ↑ ⇋ BV F ↓] ≡
[neutrino ⇋ antineutrino] equilibrium shift,
induced by magnetic ﬁeld
of matter variation. Decreasing/increasing of the vacuum symmetry shift
will be accompanied by decreasing/increasing of the eﬀective uncompensated
VPW energy;

3) shifting the Golden mean resonance conditions of [matter - bivacuum]
interaction by exchange of BvO, as a result of spatial perturbation of matter,
changing the frequency of [C ⇋ W ] pulsations of its elementary particles.
This factor may increase or decrease the amplitude of BvO and, consequently,
the amplitude of virtual pressure waves (VPW).

If geometry and other properties of matter provide the nega-
tive (repulsion) Casimir eﬀect, corresponding virtual jet generation
(VJG) increases the above described manners of inﬂuence of mat-
ter on virtual pressure waves (VPW).

The deviation of virtual replica (VR) in form of standing VPW
from ”Virtual Noise” of bivacuum and a life-time of VR are de-
pendent on the scale of coherent molecular/atomic excitations in
biosystems, i.e. amplitude of VR and proximity of characteris-
tic frequencies of VR to fundamental Golden mean frequencies of
the eﬀectiveness of resonant matter-bivacuum energy
BvO, i.e.
exchange.

Combination of the described above three factors of virtual replica (VR),
generated, for example by ’sender’: crystal, water or human Mind, may
change a strong, weak and electromagnetic interaction between quarks, el-
ementary particles, atoms and molecules of ’receiver’, its inertial mass and
gravitational potential.

31

Distant Mind-Matter interaction, including telekinesis, may be related to
dependent on human will changes of cumulative virtual pressure waves
(VPW) parameters.

It is obvious that parameters of VR of Mind are much more variable than
those of Matter. They are dependent of human will and are more adjustable
for maximum of Mind-Matter interaction.

In more conventional terminology (Puthoﬀ, Little, Ibison, 2000) the Mind
activity may change vacuum dielectric constant to value (± ∆K), vacuum
permittivity to value (±∆ε0) and vacuum permeability to value (±∆µ0). In
turn, these vacuum changes aﬀect the matter properties, existing in vacuum
medium.

Opposite by sign deviation of bivacuum properties from those, corre-
sponding to bivacuum symmetry shift equal to zero (∆mV = 0), as a result
of complicated hierarchical processes (from microscopic to macroscopic scale)
may be resulted in opposite change of velocity of radioactive decay, process of
phase transitions, kinetics of self-organization, rate of microorganisms divi-
sion, deviations of random number generator data from normal distribution
and perturbation of many other cooperative collective processes.

It is predictable, that the value of Lamb shift, dependent on virtual par-
ticles screening of electromagnetic interaction in hydrogen like atoms, may
be used as indicator of Mind-Matter interaction, if the mechanism proposed
is right. However, the strong magnetic ﬁeld, used in radiospectroscopy ex-
periments may ’screen’ the eﬀect, induced by Mind. Another possible exper-
imental approach to detect bivacuum perturbation, related to Mind activity,
is the precise measurement of Casimir eﬀect and its Mind induced variations.

6. Possible Mechanism of Mind-Mind Interaction (telepathy)

We assume, that the uncompensated due to bivacuum symmetry shift
virtual pressure waves (VPW), excited by Bivacuum oscillations (BvO)
and dependent on their amplitude, may be responsible for distant subtle
interaction between living organisms.

The amplitude of BvO, modulated by matter is dependent on the:
1) number of coherent particles, participating in this speciﬁc kind of in-

teraction;

2) sharpness of resonance between [C ⇋ W ] pulsation of elementary
particles of matter and fundamental frequencies of BvO, equal to Golden
mean frequencies (ω0 = m0c2/~)e,µ,τ . The latter factor is dependent, in turn,
on spatial-dynamic properties of matter or neuron’s organelles in private case.

32

The VR of orchestrated system of nerve cells -’senders’, excited by
coherent water of their microtubules, membranes and synaptic contacts and
perturbations of this VR as a result of series of elementary acts of con-
sciousness induce corresponding changes in similar organelles of nerve cells
-’receivers’. There are experimental evidence that cavitational ﬂuc-
tuations, accompanied by sonoluminescence, playing in our Hier-
archic model of consciousness the important role in [gel-sol] transi-
tions, are related to quantum vacuum radiation (virtual pressure)
(Eberlein, 1996). As a result, the probability of the same conse-
quence of consciousness acts as in Mind - Sender increases in Mind
of Receptor.

Modulated by vibro-gravitational ﬁeld of microtubules and membranes
the all-penetrating neutrino is another probable mediator of subtle Mind-
Mind interaction. This modulation is most eﬀective in a course of nerve cells,
including axons, excitation. Modulated by ’sender’ neutrino (a consequence
of uncompensated bivacuum fermion), leads to corresponding modulation of
vacuum symmetry shift.

Vacuum symmetry shift oscillation induce in-phase oscillation of eﬀec-
tive, uncompensated virtual pressure in water structure of microtubules,
membranes as Casimir chambers, etc. of ’receiver’.

The charged virtual particles density oscillation change correspondingly
the electromagnetic Van der Waals interaction between molecules and the
rate of physicochemical processes in nerve cells of ’receiver’. Just this sec-
ondary eﬀect of modulated neutrino is important for Mind-Mind interaction.
In such a way the transmission of emotions and images from
Mind sender to Mind receiver may occur. The closer are VR frequency-
phase parameters of two or more interacting biosystems, the higher is prob-
ability of resonant VPW exchange interaction between such systems.

The Mind-Mind interaction, mediated by modulated BvO and neutrino,

may be much more speciﬁc than in Mind-Matter interaction.

It may be most eﬀective, when interacting persons are genetically close,
i.e. their nerve systems are tuned to each other on molecular, cell/subcell
levels, generating very close Virtual Replicas and with similar reaction on
them.

7. Audio/Video Signals Skin Transmitter, based on Hierarchic
model of consciousness

I proposed the idea of new device, where the laser beam with frequency
of cavitational ﬂuctuations and/or convertons and ultraweak intensity will
be modulated by acoustic and/or video signals. The modulated output optic

33

signals will be transmitted from laser to the nerve nodes of skin, using wave-
guides.
It is supposed that the nerve impulses, stimulated by modulated
laser beam, can propagate via complex axon-synapse system to brain centers,
responsible for perception and processing of audio and video information.
The long-term memorizing process also can be stimulated eﬀectively by Skin
Transmitter.

The direct and feedback reaction between brain centers, responsible for
audio and video information processing and certain nerve nodes on skin is
predictable. The coherent electromagnetic radiation of these nodes, including
the acupuncture one can be responsible for so-called aura.

One of the important consequence of our Hierarchic model of conscious-
ness is related to radiation of ultraviolet and visible photons (”biophotons”)
as a result of water molecules recombination after their dissociation. Disso-
ciation can be stimulated by cavitational ﬂuctuation of water in the volume
of superdeformons,
inducing reversible disassembly of microﬁlaments and
[gel-sol] transition. The frequency and intensity of this electromagnetic com-
ponent of bioﬁeld, in turn, can aﬀect the kinetic energy of the electrons,
emitted by skin in the process of Kirlian eﬀect measurement. Our model
predicts, that the above mentioned stimulation of psi-activity by resonant
external radiation, should inﬂuence on colors and character of Kirlian pic-
ture, taken even from distant untreated by skin-transmitter points of human
body. There are another resonant frequencies also, calculated from my Hier-
archic theory of matter, enable to stimulate big ﬂuctuations of water in MTs
and their disassembly.

Veriﬁcation of these important consequences of our model and making a
prototype of Audio/Video Signals Skin Transmitter is the intriguing task of
future. The practical realization of Audio/Video Signals Skin Transmitter
will be a good additional evidence in proof of HMC and useful for lot of
people with corresponding disabilities.

The existence of distant Mind-Mind interaction may be proved
by encephalogram registration and Kirlian eﬀect. It is predictable,
that application of audio/video signals skin transmitter (Kaivarari-
nen, 1999, 2000b), to acupuncture points, should be eﬀective reg-
ulator and stimulator of psi-abilities.

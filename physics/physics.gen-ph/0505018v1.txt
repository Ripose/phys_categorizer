Abstract

Amplitudes An in d-dimensional scalar ﬁeld theory are generated, to all orders in
the coupling constant and at n-point. The amplitudes are expressed as a series in the
mass m and coupling λ. The inputs are the classical scattering, and these generate,
after the integrals are performed, the series expansion in the couplings λi. The group
theory of the scalar ﬁeld theory leads to an additional permutation on the L loop trace
structures. Any scalar ﬁeld theory, including those with higher dimension operators
and in any dimension, are amenable.

Introduction

The quantum scalar φ3 theory has been studied for many years and is a textbook
quantum ﬁeld theory. The interactions in this theory are typically examined to lowest
order in perturbation theory, or to higher orders in the ultraviolet so as to ﬁnd
the critical exponents and scaling. Large order studies in perturbation theory were
performed over twenty years ago, without detailed knowledge of the diagrams. The
diagrams in the usual perturbtion theory are complicated to evaluate in general, which
has slowed progress.

The derivative expansion has been pursued for several years [1]-[10]. This formu-
lation has been placed in the context of many theories, including scalar, gauge and
supersymmetric models. The derivation of the quantum scattering has been simpliﬁed
in [1]; this approach is used here to ﬁnd the amplitudes of all scalar ﬁeld theories in
any dimension, to all orders in the couplings. All coeﬃcients of the following n-point
amplitude expansion can be determined,

An =

c(i, m)λi(k2)m ,

X

(1)

with λ the coupling constant and k2m representing the generic product of the n(n −
1)/2 momentum invariant at n-point.

The tree amplitudes in φ3 theory are given in [11]. The amplitudes for any scalar

ﬁeld theory follow from this result by pinching propagators.

In general the classical amplitudes in any quantum ﬁeld theory, including massless
ones, are required to recursively construct, in this formulation, the solution to the
amplitudes and eﬀective action. The recently appeared tree amplitudes of scalar, and
gauge and gravity theory, are based on a simple number theoretic parameterization
[11], [12]. These scalar amplitudes and their coeﬃcients are used here in the quantum
scalar solution.

The classical Lagrangian that generates the amplitudes are those of massive scalar
ﬁeld theory, and includes the possible interactions. These pertain to φn, scaled with an
appropriate coupling, and the derivatives ∂n1φ . . . ∂nmφ. Group theory, the inclusion
of additional modes, and mixed interactions are also included. The group theory adds
a complication associated with permutations of external lines.

n-Point Amplitudes

The genus zero amplitudes are ﬁrst presented. Then the formulae describing the

quantum amplitudes are given and used to ﬁnd the full amplitudes.

The tree amplitudes in φ3 at all n-point have recently been described in the
literature [10]; a set of numbers φn(i) are required to specify individual diagrams.
These n − 2 numbers label the vertices and range from n to 1. In a color ordered
tree, they occur at most n − 2 times for the greatest number to none in the case of
the lowest number in an incremental manner. The set φn generates the momentum
routing of the propagators and describe the diagram.

The φn numbers can be changed to the set of numbers i, p which describe the

poles in the diagram through the invariants

t[p]
i = (ki + . . . + ki+p−1)2 .

(2)

These invariants are deﬁned for a ﬁxed ordering of the external legs and the numbers
are cyclic around the ﬁnal number. A second set of numbers, besides the σ(i, n)
are required when the mass expansion is performed. Due to the series 1/(m2 − p2) =
(p2/m2)k, the coeﬃcients ˜σ(i, p) are numbers from 0 to ∞ and label the exponent
m2
in the series for each propagator.

P

The numbers

σ(i, p)

˜σ(i, p) ,

describe the individual diagrams in the mass expansion.

The fundamental iteration is accomplished via the sewing procedure as described
in [1]-[10]. The integrals are simple free-ﬁeld ones in x-space, and generate an inﬁnite
series of relations between the parameters of the coupling expansion αpij
n,g.

with ˜lij and ˜mij parameterize a subset of the vertex lines which are contracted inside
the loop. The indices ρ label the linear combination of the loop momenta in the
internal lines.

The integrals (5) are symmetrized over the the external lines in the formula (4);
there are n1 and n2 external lines on each side of the graph and b parameterizes a
subset of these numbers (e.g. n1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, n2 = 5, 6, 7, 8 and b = 3, 4, 5, 6; the lij and
mij parameterize the kinematics associated with the exernal and internal lines. The
expansion of the integral in (5) in the momenta generate the coeﬃcients pij. the set
of numbers σ(a) parameterize the subset of numbers of the two vertices (forming an
integral with n external lines. The numbers σ(a) label numbers beyond the external
lines 1, . . . , n1 and n1 + 1, . . . , n) and are irrelevant because the integral is a function
of their sum; this property lends to a group theory interpretation of the ﬁnal result
in terms of the coeﬃcients

I σ,pij
lij ,nij ,

after summing the permutations. The numbers i, j in lij and nij span 1 to m (including
internal lines) and those in pij span 1 to n:

lij = (lij, 0, . . . , 0, lij)

nij = (0, . . . 0, nij, . . . , nij, nij, . . . , nij) ,

(7)

and

pij = (pij, . . . , pij) .

This notation of lij, mij, and pij is used to setup a (pseudo-conformal) group theory
interpretation of the scattering.

The details of the expansion of the integrals in (5) depend on the selection of the

internal lines found via the momenta of the vertices

on either side of the double vertex graph. Although the ˜lij, ˜mij, and ˜pij depend on the
details of the contractions and sums of the lines of the individual vertices, the actual
coeﬃcients of the iteration, i.e. I pij
lij,nij , are functions only of the vertex parameters.
The details of the expansion and the contractions of the tensors in the integrals (5)
are parameterized by pij, which label the momentum expansion of the integrals. The

coeﬃcients pij range from 0 to ∞, in accordance with the momentum expansion of
the massive theory.

Although the coeﬃcients I pij

lij ,nij arise from the integral expansion, they also have
a group theory description. The dynamics of the expansion are dictated via these
coeﬃcients for an arbitrary initial condition of the bare Lagrangian.

The iteration of the coeﬃcients results in the simple expression,

(10)

The sums are on the number of internal lines p and the powers of the shared couplings
i and j,

n − 2 + q = 2(n + p) − 4 + i + j

q = n + 2p − 2 + i + j ,

(11)

for the example of φ3. The numbers of momenta lij and nij are accorded to sij (some
of which are within the integral). The parameters mij label the external momenta,
interpreted group theoretically through the coeﬃcient I.

The integrals and the iteration in (10) have to be performed. The initial condition
on the sum is the form of the classical n-point amplitudes, i.e αpij
n,cl. The integral
complication is that there are invariants that: 1) contain both external and loop
momenta, and 2) contain only loop momenta. The sum must have attention to
both types of invariants as the integrals are diﬀerent with diﬀering numbers of loop
momenta.

which expresses all integrals via a derivative iteration on the integral (12). In this
expression (13) the internal momenta in sij, with the invariants numbered by lij and
nij, are replaced with a diﬀerential ∂k.

The integrals are evaluated via transforming to x-space and using the Bessel form

of the massive propagators. The propagator is in d dimensions,

∆(m, x) = λd(x2)−d/2+1Kd/2(mx) ,

(14)

The parameters are left as variables to span unusual propagation, such as φe− ˜Λ φ or
φ 2φ, in view of φ4 theory, and the quantization of perturbatively nonrenormalizable
theories. The integral in (12) evaluates to,

Due to the dimension d, there is a Taylor series for d even; the propagator should be
∆+ and ∆−, which is expanded in ∆N . Then a Taylor series expansion can be deﬁned
again for general d; else the coeﬃcients could be used as a variant of dimensional
reduction.

The coeﬃcients are deﬁned dimensional reduction and momentum (string-inspired)
cutoﬀ and to ﬁnd the theory in multiple dimensions.

The tensor integrals have been examined in [6]. Momentum of plane waves in
x-space, within the eﬀective action have the form of a derivative, as in quantum
mechanics: ki ↔ i∂i via the Fourier transform. The integrals with the internal
derivatives could be evaluated directly.

7

Those in (5) have the form (13), with the internal derivatives (or momenta)
extracted from the internal lines; these momenta have an action on the integral in
(12) as,

xµ
x2 )∆(m, x)N .
The number n counts the ∂x’s. The x factors are removable via,

∂µ∆(m, x)N = [(2 − d) + m2∂2

so that the general tensor integral requires only the scalar evaluation, followed by

shows how tree diagrams are used to construct loop amplitudes, when both are mo-

and external lines within the loop are to be an indeﬁnite number.

vertices); more general scalar theories have more than one coupling constant and the
count is more complex.

The expansion of the iterative formula is represented in Figure 1; the sum of
nodes from 2 to nmax is required. The number of an individual propagator can be
any integer, in conjunction with the expansion of a tree diagram. The external legs
are permuted at the nodes appropriate to the color structure.

The tree level initial conditions are required to solve the recursion; a scalar ﬁeld
theory possessing higher derivative terms can model any initial condition. The φ3
and φ4 initial conditions are described in [11], with a bootstrap condition q − 2 = i
and q − 2 = 2i; q is the external leg number and i counts either the 3- or 4-point
vertices (coupling constants).

are nb−1 lines to the left and nb lines to the right. The tensor structure is denoted
by n(b)

n,q.

In order to ﬁnd the product of the integrals at ﬁxed parameters, in (5), the

kinematics at the vertex are expanded as,

and

sij = (ki + i∂x)2 = 2iki · ∂x − ∂2

sij = −4∂2

x .

(45)

(46)

The ﬁrst example is the situation when i is an external leg and the other line is
an internal leg; the latter has both internal legs. The derivatives are those in (29).
Starting at the left node, the number of momenta which are internal are counted so
as to deﬁne the tensor in (5). The numbers φn are used for this count [11],[12]. These
numbers are a (symmetric) set theoretic foundation to build any φ3 tree diagram.
Given the set φn, a function has has to be made that counts the number of sij
belonging to the internal-external (ie) class. Else the explicit tree diagram labeled by
the numbers of nij has to be used, without the simple set theoretic deﬁnition.

At the node, there is a tensor from the expansion of the invariants in (45) and
(46). The number of spatial derivatives ranges from Γ1(φn, nij, υ) to Γ2(φn, nij, υ).
These numbers depend on the external leg set υ and the set of sij as deﬁned by φn
and nij. The diﬀerence between the two numbers is due to the counts sii and sie + sii,
i.e. the number of invariants with shared legs. The sets φn are not required if the
input nij is given independently. To each of these counts is a tensor Wνj;n.

11

Each of the integrals has p(b) internal lines. The tensors Wν;n contract with the
momentum of the external line as the integral is a function only of k; the explicit
form is in (42). If there are external legs attached to the node, as illustrated on node
nodei pi; these momenta contract with the node
2 in Figure 2, then k =

permutation sets are all combinations of the pairs of numbers i, j including repeating
pairs, which is the same as all sets of numbers i and j including repeating ones.

The ˜α is summed over all combinations of the momentum labels in the set of Pb,

possible ways.

The net result for the tensor at level w is a collection of snij

invariants are all external lines to the loop system at node b + 1. The number of these
invariants is denoted mnb−1
, which is a function of the preceeding node b − 1 and the
ij
number of propagators.

The integral factors in the formula (43) multiply the tensor products in (47).

The integral product is found from multiplying the scalar integrals in (5); these depend
on the number of propagators and the index w. The summation over the propagators
is independent at each integral, which does change the initial condition αnij

and qb = q − 1, q.

The permutation sum on the external lines has to be performed. The n external
lines are to be placed in all possible ways located at the b nodes. The trace structures
of a non-abelian theory require the permutation subsets of the external lines; the
color ﬂow appears simpler due to the topology of the rainbow graphs.

The iterative formulae has to include the propagator corrections. It appears that
these corrections were not included in the product form of the amplitudes. However,
the quantum vertices in (10) take into account these quantum corrections, and so
should the latter form. Tree diagrams in the mass expansion allow the generation of
propagator corrections

(If there is a formal reason to examine the amplitudes without the propagator
corrections, or m-point corrections, then it is possible to extract them. This is done by
modifying the external lines of the tree amplitudes with the mass expansion of the full

on the derivatives in the classical vertex takes into account the propagator correction
by altering the limits on the classical vertex and multiplying the Tp; there is a pj on
each internal line that modiﬁes the count of n by n → n +
2pj. The vertex gets a
Tpi. To eliminate the propagator correction, at each vertex divide by the Tpi

in a similar fashion.)

Concluding remarks

The quantum theory to any scalar ﬁeld theory is generated in a direct manner;
n-point scattering amplitudes are composed through a product of tree amplitudes
of varying coupling orders and with varying numbers of legs. The conservation of
both is used to ﬁnd the coeﬃcient of the scattering at any loop order L and n-point.

Formulae in this paper demonstrate a simple sum of products which arise from a
breaking of these orders into partitions; an example is φ3 theory in which the coupling
order is m − 2 with m being the number of legs. All scalar ﬁeld theories, including
those models with any number of higher dimensional operators, are quantized with
the initial condition of the classical scattering. The solutions could lead to better
formulations of the quantum scalar models and the possible geometries, or potential
conformal models, generating them; this includes the large coupling regime.

The requirements for any of these massive theories to be solved at any order are
the tree amplitudes, which are expanded in low energy (e.g. see [11]). The formulae
involving the Γ summations and the tensors can be simpliﬁed, and this will will lead
to a more compact representation, less than this the half page of algebra given in this
work.

The unitarity has been made indiscreet due to the large mass or low momentum
expansion. This can be found by resumming the momentum modes at a speciﬁc order.
This has been examined in [1],[5],[6],[8],[10] in the this expansion.

This work shows that the solution to a quantum ﬁeld theory can be obtained,
in the case of an arbitrary scalar ﬁeld theory in any d-dimension. The same is true
for gauge and gravity theories (for which the tree amplitudes have been found in a
number context in [12], and also in the standard model. The formulae are similar but
with more complicated tensor algebra.

The complete scalar classical scattering in generic non-linear N = 2 sigma models
also follows number theoretically from the classical φ3 theory, and this includes all
toric Calabi-Yau quotients [13]; the complete quantum solution of these scalar models
can be found.

Any non - zero component of charge implies the existence of a kind of the
inertial mass. Therefore, each of existing types of the dipole moments must
arise as a consequence of the availability of a kind of charge. From their point
of view, the elastic scattering of completely longitudinal and transversal po-
larized neutrinos (antineutrinos) by spinless nuclei is discussed taking into
account the united rest mass and charge, and also the magnetic, anapole and
electric dipole moments of incoming fermions with neutral currents. Inter-
conversions of neutrinos of the diﬀerent components have been investigated,
at which a particle chiral invariance is violated at the expense of the ﬂip of
its spin. This becomes possible owing to an intimate connection between
these phenomena and character of the structure of a Dirac mass. Analysis of
the studied processes cross sections assumed that both masses and charges
of longitudinal and transversal neutrinos are strictly unidentical.

1. Introduction

In studying the nature of elementary particles such characteristics as the
mass and charge play a large role. At the same time it is well known that
according to the hypothesis of ﬁeld mass based on the classical theory of
an extensive electron [1], a particle all the mass is purely electric. Such a
structure, however, meets with many problems. One of them states that the
charge distribution of the electron is not steady.

My investigation of the interaction of electrons and their neutrinos with
ﬁeld of emission shows clearly [2, 3] that if the neutrino corresponds to the
electron (ν = νe), its full electric charge ef ull
and magnetic moment µf ull
appear owing to the Coulomb mass mE

ν and behave as [4]

This picture reﬂects the fact that each of available types of charges say in
favor of the availability of a kind of the inertial mass. Thereby the possiblity
of the existence of the united rest mass mU
ν for the neutrino
equal respectively to its all the mass and charge is not excluded. One can
deﬁne their structures in the form [5]

ν and charge eU

mU

ν = mE

ν + mW

ν + mS

ν + ...,

ν = eE
eU

ν + eW

ν + eS

ν + ....

Here the indices E, W and S correspond to the electric, weak and strong
components of the neutrino mass and charge. They constitute herewith the
harmony of forces of the diﬀerent nature. Therefore, the charges distributions
of light leptons must be steady [6].

Such a stability of matter saying about the compound structure of charge
quantization law [7] and testiﬁes of that any non - zero component of the
electric charge implies the existence of a kind of the dipole moment.
In
other words, the Dirac F1ν(q2) and the Pauli F2ν(q2) form factors contain the
statical as well as the dynamical components [6]:

Fiν(q2) = fiν(0) + Aiν( ~q2) + ...,

(6)

(9)

where fiν(0) give the normal size of charge and moment, Aiν( ~q2) characterize
the momentum dependence of leptonic current vector parts. The terms fiν(0)
and Aiν( ~q2) are responsible for the ﬁrst and the second Born approximations.
In these circumstances, the form factors F1ν(q2) and F2ν(q2) at q2 = 0 deﬁne
the full static values of the neutrino electric charge and moment:

F1ν(0) = ef ull

F2ν(0) = µf ull

ν = enorm
ν = µnorm

+ eanom

Of course the electric mass and charge of a Dirac neutrino correspond to
the most diverse form of the same regularity of its Coulomb nature. By this
reason we conclude that the neutrino electric mass mE
ν includes in self as well
as the normal mnorm

However, it is known [8, 9] that the neutrino interaction with virtual pho-

ton is described by the vertex operator

Here σµλ = [γµ, γλ]/2, q = p
p′, p(s) and p′(s′) denote the four - momentum
(helicity) of the neutrino before and after emission, G1ν(q2) and G2ν(q2) are
the leptonic current axial - vector parts.

Analysis of electroweak processes on nuclei assumed [10] that F2ν and G2ν
must have the same size. Therefore, without loss of generality, we may write

Giν(q2) = giν(0) + Φiν( ~q2) + ...,

(10)

where g1ν(0) and g2ν(0) are the normal components of a particle anapole
[11] and electric dipole moments. The functions Φiν( ~q2) characterize the
anomalous behavior of axial - vector form factors.

According to the correspondence principle, each term in (10) as well as in
(5), corresponds to the deﬁnite approximation. This sight to the interaction
axial - vector nature quality explains the fact that G1ν(0) and G2ν(0) give
the full static size of a Dirac particle anapole and electric dipole moments:

as well as

The purpose of the present work is to discuss the problem of the neutrino
latent mass investigating its interaction with ﬁeld of electroweak emission
in the polarization type dependence. First of all we consider the elastic
scattering of longitudinal polarized massive Dirac neutrinos by nuclei of the
electric (Z) and weak (ZW ) charges

at the account of their earlier known and new properties. Next, all they will
be reanalysed for the transversal case of incoming particles polarizations. In
conclusion we present some implications implied from these considerations.

2. Interaction of Longitudinal Polarized Neutrinos with Field of a
Nucleus

From our earlier developments, we ﬁnd that the matrix elements of elastic
scattering of an arbitrary polarized neutrinos on the nucleus electric and weak
charges in the ﬁrst Born approximation must have the following structures:

µ are the nuclear charged (x = γ) and neutral (x = Z 0)
currents [15], gVν and gAν denote the corresponding constants of purely weak
interaction vector and axial - vector components.

p′E, qW = pW −

As seen from (14) and (15), in the case of exchange by the photon, only
is

the Coulomb mass is responsible for the electric scattering. Insofar as mW

concerned, it leads to the corresponding weak interaction.

one can will establish an explicit form of the studied processes cross sections.
It is not excluded, however, that any Dirac particle possesses simultaneously
both electric and weak masses.
In other words, the neutrino interaction
with ﬁeld of emission explained by the electroweak interference arises at the
expense of exchange simultaneously both by the photon and by the weak
boson. From this point of view, the interference between the interactions
(14) and (15) can be expressed as follows:

The indices V and A imply the simultaneous presence of both vector and

of the expressions (19) - (21) for the neutrino (λc = +1) and the antineutrino

the interaction vector and axial - vector components.

The compound structures of both terms of (22) testify of that the neutrino
charge f1ν leads to the scattering either with or without ﬂip of its spin. The
anapole g1ν does not change a particle helicity. In contrast to this, the vector
f2ν and axial - vector g2ν moments are responsible only for the ﬂip of the
neutrino spin. Of course, our formulas can also conﬁrm the fact that the
helicity of the neutrino of large energy (Eν ≫
However, as known, the right - handed neutrino meets with the problem
which states that does not exist a chiral symmetry characterized a massive
particle. Therefore, it appears that the neutrinos have no neither the electric,
weak nor any other mass. But this is not quite so. The point is that at the
conservation of helicity a particle chirality is not changed even if it possesses
a non - zero rest mass. In other words, the longitudinal neutrino chirality
can be violated at the expense of mass, charge, magnetic and electric dipole
moments, because they lead to the ﬂip of its spin.

In the absence of one of currents V or A any of (19) - (21) not only for
the particles and the antiparticles but also for the left - and right - handed
neutrinos coincides. Such an equality takes place as well as in the low energies
limits of the corresponding processes.

3. Transversal Polarized Neutrinos Scattering by Nuclei of
Electroweak Charges

7

Owing to an intimate connection between the mass of a particle and its
physical nature, any massive neutrino has the longitudinal as well as the
transversal polarization. Here an important circumstance is the fact that the
same neutrino must not be simultaneously both longitudinal and transversal
fermions. There exists, however, the possibility that the longitudinal polar-
ized neutrinos in the elastic scattering on a nucleus can be converted into the
transversal polarized and vice versa [16].

Returning to (14) - (17), for the transversal case of the neutrino polariza-
tion we establish the compound structure of the cross section of the process
(13) which one can present as follows:

dσV,A

EW (θ, ϕ, s, s′) = dσV,A

As well as in (18), each term in (23) contains the contributions of vector
and axial - vector interactions, and also the contributions of their interfer-
ence between themselves owing to which, the neutrino and the antineutrino
scattering cross sections are diﬀerent.

Furthermore, if taken into account the availability of the multiplier (1+ss′)

and (1

ss′) in (24) - (26), we can present (23) in the form

EW (θ, ϕ, s) = dσV,A

EW (θ, ϕ, s′ =

(27)

An explicit expressions for both terms of (27) have the most diverse struc-
tures. From their point of view, in the case of the neutrino transversal polar-
ization, the processes with or without change of incoming particles helicities
must go as a consequence not only of charge but also of any dipole moment.
It is of course not excluded that the ﬂip of the transversal neutrino spin which
arises at the expense of mass, charge, magnetic, anapole and electric dipole
moments can explain the possible violation of its chirality.

The absence of one of currents V or A implies that each of (24) - (26)
for the neutrino and the antineutrino as well as for the left - and right -
handed particles is not diﬀerent. Such a coincidence takes place even in the
low energies limits of the corresponding types of interactions.

4. Conclusion

In conformity with laws of the nature of a massive neutrino, the presence
of any type charge implies the existence of a kind of the inertial mass [5].
Such a duality of matter saying about the steadity of charge distribution
of the neutrino and testiﬁes of that each of all possible types of the dipole
moments arises as a consequence of the availability of a kind of charge [6].
Therefore, to reanalyse these features and discuss their some implications we
have established the compound structures of the diﬀerential cross sections
described the elastic scattering of completely longitudinal and transversal
polarized neutrinos (antineutrinos) by spinless nuclei taking into account the
united rest mass and charge, and also the magnetic, anapole and electric
dipole moments of incoming fermions with neutral currents.

10

They state that if neutrinos are of longitudinal polarized, their charge
answers to the elastic scattering either with or without ﬂip of the spin. The
anapole is responsible only for the conservation of a particle helicity. Unlike
this, both magnetic and electric dipole moments lead to the interconversions
of neutrinos of the diﬀerent components. However, in the transversal case of
the neutrino polarization, each of these processes can originate through the
interactions of charge as well as of any dipole moment with ﬁeld of emission.
νL is incompatible
with chiral invariance. These transitions, however, take place owing to the
rest mass dependence of the behavior of the neutrino. At our sight, this
connection implies that a particle chirality is violated at the expense of the
ﬂip of its helicity.

The exitence of interconversions νL ↔

νR and νR ↔

In the case of the neutrino both longitudinl and transversal polarizations,
the process (13) is described by the three diﬀerential cross sections corre-
sponding to the electric, weak and the united electroweak parts of mass and
charge. These cross sections can be deﬁned simultaneously for the same en-
ergy, if herewith all the three momentum transfer have the space - like size.
One of the beautiful new features of our formulas is the indication to the
existence of the diﬀerent low energies limits for the same particle regardless
of polarization type. They of course in the slow neutrino scattering by nuclei
behave as

processes with longitudinal and transversal fermions are not diﬀerent:

(31)
But all the three equalities (29) - (31) there exist only at the condition

that a particle rest mass does not depend on the type of polarization.

Thus, if it turns out that at the availability of a non - zero mass the longi-
tudinal polarized neutrino must be converted into the transversal polarized
and vice versa, this will indicate to the existence of fundamental diﬀerences in
the masses as well as in the charges of longitudinal and transversal neutrinos.

(29)

(30)

11

Comparing (19) with (24), it is easy to observe the contribution of sf1νg1ν
which is absent at the elastic scattering of longitudinal neutrinos on nuclei
but arises as a result of their transversal polarization. The term sf2νg2ν
available in the longitudinal case of the neutrino polarization does not appear
at the transversal particles interaction. We can, therefore, conclude that
the invariance of vector and axial - vector types of electroweak currents of
longitudinal and transversal neutrinos concerning C, P and T, and also their
combinations CP and CPT are diﬀerent.

Finally, insofar as the spin polarization type dependence of the behavior of
massive Majorana neutrinos is concerned, this question together with some
aspects of the geometrical nature of the inertial mass will be treatmented in
one of our further articles.

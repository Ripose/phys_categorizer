Abstract

In this paper, we introduce an estimate of the ”commercial eﬃ-
ciency” of Santilli’s hadronic reactorsTM of molecular type [1] (Patented
and International Patents Pending) which convert a liquid feedstock
(such as automotive antifree and oil waste, city or farm liquid waste,
crude oil, etc.) into the clean burning magnegasTM plus heat acquired
by the liquid feedstock. The conversion is done via a new process
based on a certain ﬂow of the liquid feedstock through a submerged
electric arc between carbon-base electrodes and other features. The
”commercial eﬃciency” is deﬁned as the ratio between the total en-
ergy output (energy in magnegas plus heat) and the electric energy
used for its production, while the ”scientiﬁc eﬃciency” is the usual
ratio between the total energy output and the total energy input (the
sum of the electric energy plus the energy in the liquid feedstock as
well as that in the carbon electrodes). Needless to say, the scientiﬁc
eﬃciency is always smaller than one because of the conservation of
energy. However, a peculiar features of Santilli’s hadronic reactors
of molecular type is that their commercial eﬃciency is considerably

0

bigger than one, namely, the reactors are capable of tapping energy
from the liquid feedstock and the carbon rods. A primary purpose
of this paper is to show that conventional thermochemistry does in-
deed predict a commercial eﬃciency bigger than one, although their
values is considerably smaller than the actual eﬃciency measured in
the reactors, thus indicating the applicability of the covering hadronic
chemistry from which the reactors have received their name. Under
the conditions that the reactions run at temperature T = 25o C and
pressure p = 1 atm, the chemical composition of the combustible gas
is conventional, and all thermochemical calculations processes are con-
ventional, we reach an upper limit of the commercial eﬃciency of 3.11
for the use of pure water as feedstock, and of 3.11 to 7.5 for a mixture
of ethyleneglicole and water with increasing relative consumption of
ethyleneglicole with respect to the consumption of carbon rods. The
study of the heat produced by the reactions leads to large divergencies
between the thermochemical predictions and experimental data of at
least a factor of three. Such divergencies can only be explained with
deviations from quantum chemistry in favor of the covering hadronic
chemistry and. In particular, the indicated large divergencies can only
be explained with the assumption that the produced combustible gas
has the new non-valence chemical structure of Santilli magnecules.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we introduce an estimate of the ”commercial eﬃciency” of San-
tilli’s hadronic reactorsTM of molecular type [1] (Patented and International
Patents Pending) which convert a liquid feedstock into the clean burning
magnegasTM plus heat acquired by the liquid feedstock.

The reactors operate via a new process based on a certain ﬂow of the liquid
feedstock through a submerged electric arc between submerged carbon-base
electrodes (for which reason the reactors are also called PlasmaArcFlowTM
reactors) and other features.

The ”commercial eﬃciency” [1] is deﬁned as the ratio between the total
energy output (energy in magnegas plus heat) and the electric energy used
for its production, while the ”scientiﬁc eﬃciency” is the usual ratio between
the total energy output and the total energy input (the sum of the electric
energy plus the energy in the liquid feedstock as well as that in the car-
bon electrodes). Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the word ”eﬃciency” is referred
hereon to the ”commercial eﬃciency.” The latter name originates from the
fact that liquid wastes carry an income, rather than having a cost and, for
this reason, they are not included in commercial calculations of operating
costs.

Needless to say, the scientiﬁc eﬃciency is always smaller than one be-
cause of the conservation of energy. However, a peculiar feature of Santilli’s
hadronic reactors of molecular type is that their commercial eﬃciency is con-
siderably bigger than one, namely, the reactors are capable of tapping energy
from the liquid feedstock and the carbon rods.

A primary purpose of this paper is to show that conventional thermochem-
istry does indeed predicts a commercial eﬃciency bigger than one, although
their values is considerably smaller than the actual eﬃciency measured in the
reactors, thus indicating the applicability of the covering hadronic chemistry
from which the reactors have received their name.

By its elementary chemical content, magnegas is similar to the water gas,
or synthesis gas, although we should emphasize that magnegas is produced
under a DC electric arc, and reveals an unusual chemical structure character-
ized by the presence of heavy molecular mass clusters, which have not been
identiﬁed by Gas Chromatography Mass-Spectroscopy and InfraRed spec-
troscopy (GC-MS/IR) tests among about 135,000 species [1, 2]. This feature
may be naturally attributed to the inﬂuence of the plasma arc and related

2

strong external magnetic ﬁeld which can lead to new couplings of CO and
H2 molecules and other new eﬀects.

In Secs. 2 and 3, we consider in detail conventional chemical reactions in
a PlasmaArcFlow reactor operating with pure water or ethyleneglicole and
water mixtures as feedstock. We treat the gas produced as a simple mixture
of carbon monoxide CO and hydrogen H2 viewed as ideal gases, to simplify
consideration, and calculate its combustion heat.

We estimate the upper theoretical limit of the eﬃciency of the reactor
by using only chemical energy balance equations. The eﬃciency is deﬁned
as a ratio between the total energy release (including combustion heat of
magnegas) to the energy input (electricity consumed). Such eﬃciency is over
unity due to the fact that the sum of the combustion heat of the gas and
the heat acquired by the liquid is bigger than the electric energy needed
It is therefore evident that, for the case of water as
for their production.
feedstock, the missing energy originates from the combustion of carbon with
oxygen originating from the separation of water. This is due to the fact that
the original water is reproduced in the combustion and, therefore, cannot
contribute to the total eﬃciency.

Independent experimental tests of the eﬃciency of the PlasmaArcFlow
reactors clearly conﬁrm such a commercial over-unity [1], since the measured
value of the over-unity is of about 3 to 5 for antifreeze stock at atmospheric
pressure with bigger values for bigger pressures and powers. Our theoretical
result is that the upper limit of the commercial over-unity ranges from 3.11
to 7.5, in a remarkable correspondence to the tests.

However,

it should be noted that, whenever the study is speciﬁed to
the heat acquired by the liquid feedstock a discrepancy of a factor of three
originates between experimental data and the prediction of thermochemical
calculations. An additional discrepancy also of a factor of about three exists
between the measured combustion heat of magnegas and its predicted value.
The above discrepancies are of such a magnitude to support the hy-
pothesis that the chemical composition of magnegas is that Santilli’s mag-
necules [1].

It should also be noted that our calculations are based, as usual, on ther-
mochemical values at T = 25oC and pressure p = 1 atm while the arc plasma
(reaction zone) is characterized by much higher temperatures. Therefore, our
results are of preliminary character. Also, in the present paper we do not
consider issues pertaining to mechanism of the reactions, thermodynamics,

In Sec. 4 we consider in detail the energy balance for the plasma creation.
In Sec. 5 we introduce the heat production coeﬃcient and calculate the heat
production. In Sec. 6 we consider the total heat production as a sum of the
heat produced and the combustion heat of the gas. In Sec. 7 we outline the
results. Numerical data are presented in Appendix.

2 Water as a feedstock of PlasmaArcFlow re-

actors

The main chemical reactions in PlasmaArcFlow reactors are the gasiﬁcation
of carbon (graphite), evaporation of water, and the conversion of water and
carbon to hydrogen and carbon monoxide, according to the known reactions

C(solid) → C(gas) − 171.7,

H2O(liquid) → H2O(vapor) − 10.4,

H2O(vapor) + C(gas) → H2(gas) + CO(gas) + 138.8,

in kcal/mol. Therefore the related the balance reaction, i.e.,

H2O(liquid) + C(solid) → H2(gas) + CO(gas) − 43.9,

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

is endothermic. Hereon, we use binding energies represented in Table 1.

The energy input of 1 kW·h = 860 kcal produces 860/43.9 = 19.6 moles
= 19.6×22.4 l = 439 l = 439/28.317 cf = 15.5 cf of H2 and the same amount

CO + H2 + O2 → CO2 + H2O(vapor) + 126.2,

CO + H2 + O2 → CO2 + H2O(liquid) + 136.6,

i.e., the 50%-50% mixture of (CO+H2) ideal gas has 68.3 kcal/mol = 271.2
BTU/mol = 342.8 BTU/cf content1. The total combustion heat is 19.6×126.2
= 2473.5 kcal = 2.88 kW·h (for water vapor) and 19.6×136.6 = 2677.4 kcal
= 3.11 kW·h (for water liquid), respectively. Therefore, the theoretical upper
limit of the eﬃciency is 3.11.

Clearly, only some part k of the consumed electric energy contributes
directly the reaction (4) because some of the electric energy is consumed
in the production of heat (dissipation). Consequently, the real eﬃciency is
3.11k, where k < 1.

1Due to experimental tests magnegas, which consists mainly of CO and H2 at approx-

imately equal percentages, has about 800 BTU/cf energy content [1].

3 Antifreeze as a feedstock of PlasmaArcFlow

reactors

We assume that antifreeze consists of ethyleneglicole and water. The com-
plete dissociation of ethyleneglicole (we ignore evaporation heat and solution
eﬀects) is characterized by

HO-CH2-CH2-OH(gas) → 4C + 6H + 2O − 869.6,

(9)

and the subsequent association of CO and H2,

HO-CH2-CH2-OH → 2CO + 3H2 − 45.4,

(10)

produces 2 moles of CO and 3 moles of H2.

In PlasmaArcFlow reactors we thus have a pair of chemical reactions, (4)

and (10), or

rHO-CH2-CH2-OH+H2O+C → (2r+1)CO+(3r+1)H2−(45.5r+43.9), (11)

where r represents the relative consumption of ethyleneglicole with respect
to that of carbon rod.

The energy eﬀect of reaction (11) is endothermic, -(45.4r + 43.9) kcal < 0.
The energy input of 1 kW·h = 680 kcal produces (2r + 1)680/(45.4r + 43.9)
moles of CO and (3r + 1)680/(45.4r + 43.9) moles of H2, with the total
combustion energy,

680
45.4r + 43.9

((2r + 1)68.7 + (3r + 1)67.9) kcal,

(12)

where we have used Eqs. (5) and (6) Therefore, the upper theoretical limit
of the eﬃciency is given by

1
45.4r + 43.9

((2r + 1)68.7 + (3r + 1)67.9) .

(13)

For r = 0, we recover the value 3.11 obtained in Sec. 2. The eﬃciency in-
creases from 3.11 to 7.51 with the increase of r from 0 to inﬁnity. Figures 1
and 2 display eﬃciency (13) as a function of r. Only some part k of the elec-
tric energy consumed contributes directly the reaction (11) because, again,

some electric energy is dissipated into heat. Therefore, the real eﬃciency of
the reactor is less than that given by Eq. (13).

In general, higher consumption rates of ethyleneglicole and carbon rods
per 1 kW·h electricity consumed imply bigger real eﬃciency. This is due
to higher values of k, which depend on design of the reactor. In turn, the
consumption rates depend on reaction rates, volume of the reaction zone,
rates of the reactants (ethyleneglicole, water, gasiﬁed carbon rod) input,
rates of the products (CO and H2) removal, stoichimetric ratios, etc. The
reaction rates depend on temperature and pressure. The volume of the reac-
tion zones depends on size of the plasma arc and on the size of surrounding
high-temperature regions. The rates of the reactants inlet and products out-
let depend on the rate of the carbon rod gasiﬁcation, geometry and velocity
of the liquid ﬂow, and pressure. Here, it is important to identify a limiting
factor (e.g., the slowest rate among the above) in order to better represent
the eﬃciency of the reactor.

4 Accounting for plasma creation

We now present calculations of the energy required to convert liquid water
and solid graphite into the plasma state so as to identify its possible contri-
bution to the overall eﬃciency.

4.1 Water contribution
We take 1 mole of liquid water at T = 20oC and atmospheric pressure as an
initial state.

(1) The energy required to heat up one mole of water from T = 20C to

T = 100C is Q1 = 1.4 kcal.

(2) The energy required to evaporate one mole of water is Q2 = 10.4 kcal.
(3) The energy required to heat up one mole of water vapor from T =

100C to T = 3600C = 3300K is Q3 = 26 kcal.

(4) The energy required for total disintegration of one mole of water

molecules to individual atoms is Q4 = 221.6 kcal,

H2O → H + H + O − Q4.

(14)

8

(5) The energy required to ionize all the H and O atoms can be calculated

due to the following known values of the ﬁrst ionization potentials,

H → H+ + e − 13.6 eV, O → O+ + e − 13.6 eV.

(15)

Taking into account that 1 eV = 3.83 · 10−23 kcal, the Avogadro number is
N = 6 · 1023 particles per mole, 1 mole of water (i.e. N molecules of water)
gives 2N atoms of the hydrogen and N atoms of the oxygen (in total 3N
atoms), we have

Q5 = 3N13.6 eV = 3 · 6 · 1023 · 13.6 eV = 244.8 · 1023 eV,

(16)

i.e.,

where

Q5 = 244.8 · 1023 · (3.83 · 10−23) kcal = 937.6 kcal.

(17)

In total we obtain the following energy required to convert 1 mole of liquid

water into the pure plasma state,

H2O(liquid) → H2O(plasma) − Q,

Q = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5,

(18)

(19)

so that by inserting the above values, we ﬁnally get the following numerical
value:

Q = 1.4 + 10.4 + 26 + 221.6 + 937.6 = 1197 kcal.

(20)

4.2 Carbon contribution
We assume 1 mole of solid carbon (graphite) at T = 20oC and atmospheric
pressure as an initial state.

(1) The energy required to heat up one mole of graphite from T = 300K

to T = 3300K is E1 = 6 kcal;

C (gas) − E2, is E2 = 171.7 kcal;

(2) The energy required to evaporate one mole of graphite, C (solid) →

(3) The energy required to ionize one mole of graphite can be calculated

due to the following known values of the ﬁrst ionization potential:

C → C+ + e − 11.3 eV.

(21)

9

One mole contains N = 6 · 1023 atoms, so the require energy is

E3 = 11.3N eV = 67.8 · 1023 eV,

or, using 1 eV = 3.83 · 10−23 kcal,

E3 = 259.7 kcal.

In total, we obtain the following energy required to convert 1 mole of solid
carbon to the pure plasma state,

where

C(solid) → C(plasma) − E,

E = E1 + E2 + E3,

E = 437.4 kcal.

so that by inserting the above values, we ﬁnally obtain the following numer-
ical value,

4.3 Fully ionized plasma of 2H, O and C

In total, the energy required to convert 1 mole of liquid water and 1 mole of
solid carbon to a pure plasma state is the sum of the above two energies,

W = Q + E,

i.e.,

W = 1197 + 437.4 = 1634.4 kcal.

This energy is required to convert 1 mole the water and 1 mole of carbon
to 4 moles of the pure plasma, as a sum of 2 moles of H, 1 mole of O, and
1 mole of C. More precisely, the plasma consists of 2N positive ions H+, N
positive ions O+, N positive ions C+, and 4N electrons.

We can convert moles to cubic foots by assuming that the plasma is an
ideal gas. Using the facts that 1 mole of ideal gas is 22.4 liters and 1 cf is
28.3 liters, we obtain that 1 mole of ideal gas is 0.79 cf.

Thus, 4 moles = 4·22.4 liters = 89.6 liters = 3.16 cf of plasma require
1634.4 kcal energy input due to the above result. So that we obtain the

following estimation of the energy needed to convert 1 mole of H2O and 1
mole of C (graphite) to the plasma,

per one mole of the 100% ionized 2H,O,C plasma; or

1634.4/4 = 408.5 kcal

1634.4/3.16 = 517 kcal

per one cubic foot of the 100% ionized 2H,O,C plasma; or, using the relation
1 kWh = 860 kcal,

517/860 = 0.6 kWh

per one cubic foot of the 100% ionized 2H,O,C plasma, or, using the relation
1 kWh = 3413 BTU,

3413 · 0.6 = 2052 BTU

per one cubic foot of the 100% ionized 2H,O,C plasma.

The following remarks are in order. In our study, (i) we do not take into
account energies associated to cathode, anode, and in the form of a radi-
ation (DC electric low-voltage high-current discharge in water vapor); (ii)
we do not consider ﬂuidodynamics and thermodynamics issues associated to
the ﬂow and bubbles in the PAF reactor; (iii) we do not consider mecha-
nism of the reactions and chemical kinetics issue; (iv) we do not consider
magnetochemistry (inﬂuence of strong external magnetic ﬁeld on the species
and chemical reactions) of the PAF reactor; and (v) we do not consider the
creation of clusters containing molecules and atoms.

4.4 No recombination of water

We assume 1 mole of liquid water and 1 mole of solid graphite, at T = 300 K.
Reactions (33) and (35) below are due to the formation of the 2H,O,C
plasma, with T = 3300 K, from the above water and graphite. Reaction (37)
is ion recombination of 2H; reaction (38) is formation of H2 gas; reaction (39)
is ion recombinations of C and O; and reaction (40) is formation of CO gas;
namely,

H2O(liquid, 300 K) → 2H(plasma, 3300 K)+O(plasma, 3300 K)−1197 kcal,
(33)

(34)

where

where

Qwater = 1197 kcal.

C(solid, 300K) → C(plasma, 3300K) − 437.4 kcal,

Qcarbon = 437.4 kcal.

2H(plasma, 3300K) → 2H(gas, 300K) + 625 kcal,
(37)
where 625 kcal= 2N13.6 eV = 163.2·1023 eV is ion recombination heat of 2
moles of H (2H+ + 2e → 2H);

2H(gas, 3300K) → H2(gas, 300K) + 104.2 + 18 kcal.

(38)

Here, 104.2 kcal are released due to recombination heat of H2 molecule, H
+ H → H2, and 18 kcal are due to cooling down of a diatomic gas from
T = 3300K to T = 300K. Heat capacity of a diatomic gas is about 6 to 7
cal/(mole K), at high and low temperatures.

C(plasma, 3300K) + O(plasma, 3300K) → C(gas, 3300K)+

(39)

+O(gas, 3300K) + 259 + 313 kcal;
where 259 kcal= N11.26 eV = 67.6·1023 eV is ion recombination heat of 1
mole of C (C+ + e →C), and 313 kcal = N13.6 eV = 81.6·1023 eV is ion
recombination heat of 1 mole of O (O+ + e →O);

C(gas, 3300K) + O(gas, 3300K) → CO(gas, 300K) + 255.8 + 18 kcal, (40)

where 255.8 is energy released during formation of carbon monoxide CO,
and 18 is energy released due to the cooling down of CO from T = 3300K
to T = 300K.

In conclusion,
(i) The creation of 4 moles of fully ionized 2H,O,C plasma (T=3300K)

requires

Qwater + Qcarbon = 1197 + 437 = 1634 kcal;

(41)

Thus, the energy consumption for the plasma is (1/4)1634 kcal/mol, i.e.

408.5 kcal/mol = 0.475 kWh/mol = 1621BTU/mol = 515.8 kcal/cf = (42)

12

= 0.600 kWh/cf = 2047 BTU/cf of the plasma;

(ii) The formation of 1 mole of H2(gas, 300K) releases 625+104.2 + 18 =

(iii) The formation of 1 mole of CO(gas, 300K) releases 259+313+255.8

747 kcal;

+ 18 = 846 kcal;

(iv) In total, 747+846= 1593 kcal is released as a heat. Thus, the heat

released is (1/4)1593 =398 kcal/mol=1994 BTU/cf of the plasma.

(v) In total, 2 moles of the CO+H2 (1:1 ratio) gas have been produced
from 4 moles of the plasma (more precisely, from 4 moles of the positive ions
and 4 moles of electrons);

(vi) As the net result, from (i) and (iv) we obtain 1593-1634 = - 41 kcal

per two moles of CO+H2 gas, i.e. the considered reaction,

C (solid) + H2O (liquid) → C (plasma) + 2H (plasma) + O (plasma) →
(43)

→ CO (gas) + H2 (gas) ,

is endothermic. Within the adopted accuracy, this value conﬁrms the value
43.9 kcal of Eq. (4) obtained without consideration of the intermediate plasma
state.

(vii) Since the number of moles of the gas produced is two times less than
the number of moles of the plasma we have, in addition to the above results
(i) and (iv), the following alternative result. The energy input is 2·2047 =
4094 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas; and the heat produced by the exothermic
reactions is 2·1994 BTU/cf = 3988 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas. The total
balance is −4094 + 3988 = −108 BTU/cf.

4.5

50% recombination of water

The reaction

C + H2O → C(plasma) + 2H(plasma) + O(plasma) → CO + H2

(44)

represents an ideal situation because in reality some atoms may recombine
back into the water. Therefore, we should consider the more general case,

C+xH2O → C(plasma)+2H(plasma)+O(plasma) → x1H2O+x2CO+x3H2.
(45)

13

For x1 6= 0, we have lower eﬃciency of the process since the target products
are CO and H2.

Below, we consider the sequence starting with 1 mole of water and 1/2
mole of graphite; reactions (46) and (47) below are formation of the 2H,
O, (1/2)C plasma; reaction (48) is ion recombination of H and (1/2)O, and
recombination of liquid (1/2)H2O (50% recombination); reaction (49) is ion
recombination of the remaining H; reaction (50) is formation of (1/2)H2; reac-

In conclusion,
(i) The formation of 3.5 moles of 2H, O, 1

2 C plasma with T=3300K from
1 mole of liquid water and 1/2 mole of solid graphite (T=300K) requires
1197+218.5= 1415.5 kcal. Thus, the energy consumption for the plasma
i.e. 404.4 kcal/mol = 0.47 kWh/mol = 1605
is (1/3.5)1415.5 kcal/mol,
BTU/mol = 510.6 kcal/cf = 0.594 kWh/cf = 2026 BTU/cf of the plasma;

(ii) 50% recombination of water (1/2 moles of water) releases 598.5 kcal;
(iii) The formation of 1/2 moles of H2 releases 1
2(625 + 104.2 + 18) =

312.5 + 52.1 + 9 = 373.6 kcal;

(iv) The formation of 1/2 moles of CO releases 1

2(259+313+255.8+18) =

129.5 + 156.5 + 128 + 9 = 423 kcal;

(v) In total, 1 mole of CO+H2 (1:1) gas and 1/2 mole of water has been
2C plasma (more precisely, from 3.5

produced from 3.5 moles of the 2H, O, 1
moles of the positive ions and 3.5 moles of electrons);

the heat released is 1

(vi) In total, 598.5+373.6+423 = 1395.1 kcal released as a heat. Thus,
3.51395.1 =399 kcal/mol = 1997 BTU/cf of the plasma.
(vii) Since the number of moles of the gas produced is 3.5 times less than
number of moles of the plasma we alternatively have, in addition to the above
results (i) and (vi), that the energy input is 3.5×2026 = 7091 BTU/cf of the
CO+H2 gas; and the heat produced by the exothermic reactions is 3.5×1997
BTU/cf = 6990 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas.

5 Heat production

5.1 No heat production

No heat production is here understood in the sense that all the heat produced
by the exothermic reactions is used back in the endothermic reactions, and
thus helps the formation of the plasma and CO+H2 gas. The energy balance
could be calculated as follows:

15

Energy required to form the plasma + Energy released as a heat.

(53)

Since the energy input is negative while heat produced is positive we obtain
from the above result (vi) of Sec. 4.4 the following energy consumption:

− 4094 + 3988 = −106 BTU/cf of the gas;

(54)

and from the above result (vii) of Sec. 4.5 (the case of 50% recombination of
water):

− 7091 + 6990 = −101 BTU/cf of the gas.

(55)

Here, minus sign means that energy is required. Hence, about 100 BTU
is required to produce 1 cf of the gas, under the assumption that the reactor
has ideal 100% eﬃciency (does not produce any heat but only the gas).

5.2 The heat production coeﬃcient

The heat produced by the exothermic reactions (see (vi) of Sec. 4.4 and
(vii) of Sec. 4.5) is distributed via two main channels: ﬁrst, it contributes to
the endothermic reactions and, second, it is dissipated into the environment
(heat production). If some part k,

0 < k < 1,

(56)

of the heat produced by the exothermic reactions is removed due to dissipa-
tion (convection, radiation, heat-mass transfer, etc.) to the environment from
the region where the endothermic reactions occur, i.e., the ”heat production
coeﬃcient” is given by

k =

Heat transferred to environment
Heat produced by exothermic reactions

.

Therefore the remaining part, (1 − k), of the heat,

1 − k =

Heat transferred to endothermic reactions
Heat produced by exothermic reactions

(57)

(58)

is used in the endothermic reactions. The latter part of heat cannot be
measured directly since it is absorbed by the endothermic reactions thus

16

helping the formation of the plasma and CO+H2 gas. Therefore, we could
modify the above energy consumptions (54) and (55) as follows:

− 4094 + (1 − k)3988 BTU/cf

and

and

and

− 7091 + (1 − k)6990 BTU/cf

of the gas, with the associated heat produced being

k3988 BTU/cf

k6990 BTU/cf

of the gas, respectively. The heat productions (61) and (62) are those cor-
responding to the measurable heat produced since these heats are absorbed
by the environment (surrounding liquid, metal parts of the reactor, etc.).

5.3 Example 1: 70% heat production

For k=0.7 (70% of the total heat is dissipated/utilized and 30% is used in
the endothermic reactions), we get energy consumptions

− 4094 + 0.3 · 3988 = −2898 BTU/cf

− 7091 + 0.3 · 6990 = −4994 BTU/cf

of the gas, with the associated heat production (i.e. measurable heat pro-
duced) being

of the gas and

0.7 · 3988 = 2792 BTU/cf

0.7 · 6990 = 4893 BTU/cf

of the gas, respectively. These heat productions correspond to measurable
heats produced.

(64)

(65)

(66)

17

5.4 Example 2: 100% heat production

For k=1 (100% of the heat produced by exothermic reactions is dissipated/utilized),
we evidently have the maximal value for the energy consumptions:

(67)

(68)

(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

of the gas, and the associated maximal values of the heat productions:

of the gas; and

of the gas; and

− 4094 BTU/cf

− 7091 BTU/cf

3988 BTU/cf

6990 BTU/cf

of the gas, respectively. These heat productions correspond to measurable
heats produced.

6 Total heat produced

We now add the combustion heat of the produced CO+H2 (1:1) gas (the
theoretical value is 315 BTU/cf) to the measurable heat produced by the
reactor, in order to estimate the total heat produced. By adding 315 BTU/cf
to the heats (59) and (60) we obtain the total measurable heat produced

k3988 + 315 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas;

and

k6990 + 315 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas,

for the cases of 0% and 50% recombination of water, respectively. Here,
the coeﬃcient k (0 < k < 1) is deﬁned by (57) and can be given in some
approximate value by studying thermodynamics of a speciﬁc reactor. This
coeﬃcient accounts for all heat losses, including that at (tungsten) anode.

By assuming that the total heat produced is approximately equal to the
energy input (see the energy inputs in (vi) of Sec. 4.4 and (vii) of Sec. 4.5),
that is, by assuming the eﬃciency 1, we have

k3988 + 315 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas
4094 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas

= 1,

(73)

18

and

and

and

and

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

(78)

k6990 + 315 BTU/cf of the CO + H2 gas
7091 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas

= 1.

Therefore, we obtain

k = 0.948

k = 0.969,

respectively. The measurable total heat produced is

4094 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas;

7091 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas,

which is valid under conditions (73) and (74), i.e., that the total measurable
heat produced is equal to the energy input.

The above estimations (75) and (76) mean that about 95% of the (elec-
tric) energy input is dissipated into the environment and the remaining 5%
contributes to the endothermic chemical reactions.

The following remark is in order. We can account for additional heat
production which could not be accounted by the coeﬃcient k by adding
some heat Q′, so that (77) and (78) become

k3988 + 315 + Q′ BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas
4094 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas

= A,

(79)

k6990 + 315 + Q′ BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas
7091 BTU/cf of the CO+H2 gas

= A,

(80)

where A can be taken approximately one, or some other value. However,
one can incorporate Q′ into k by simple rediﬁnition. For instance, k3988 +
315 + Q′ → k3988 + 315 + k′3988 → (k + k′)3988 + 315 → k3988 + 315, and
we arrive again to the estimation (75), for A = 1. However, here k acquires
some other meaning which is diﬀerent than that in Eq. (57).

7 Conclusions

In this paper we have studied the upper limit of the ”commercial eﬃciency”
[1], simply referred i the text as ”eﬃciency” of Santilli’s hadronic reactors of
molecular type, also called PlasmaAArcFlow reactors [1].

For the case of pure water we have obtained the upper limit 3.11, while
for the mixture of ethyleneglicole and water the eﬃciency is given by Eq.
(13) (see Figs. 1 and 2), and rises from 3.11 to about 7.5, with increase of
the relative consumption of ethyleneglicole with respect to that of carbon
rods. These results are based on the assumptions that all thermochemical
processes are conventional and have been obtained at at T = 25oC and p = 1
atm.

Similar calculations can be made for diﬀerent water-based liquid wastes,

provided that their main chemical composition is known.

We have accounted for the plasma production, and obtained a more de-
tailed view on the steps of the entire process. This has allowed us to account
for the water recombination and the heat production coeﬃcient.

The comparison of the theoretical results with measurements leads to a
sharp discrepancy between theoetical predictions and experimental data. In
fact, the ﬁtting of the measured commercial over-unity leads to a prediction
which is about three times smaller than the measured heat. On the other
hand, the ﬁtting of the measured heat production leads to the prediction
that the measured commercial over-unity is smaller than that predicted.

The implications of the above calculations are the following. The fact that
the heat produced in the PlasmaArcFlow reactors is less than 1/3 the theo-
retical prediction constitutes clear evidence that magnegas is not composed
of conventional H2 and CO molecules. Alternatively, the indicated evidence
prohibits the complete formation of H2 and CO. It then follows that magne-
gas is indeed composed of clusters, called Santilli magnecules [1], which are
composed of clusters of individual H, C and O atoms, dimers OH, CH or C-O
in single bond, and ordinary molecules H2 and CO under a new attraction
between opposite polarities created by magnetic and electric polarizations of
the orbitals of individual atoms into toroids.

On the other side, the fact that the heat content of magnegas is about
3 times that predicted is additional strong evidence that magnegas, again,
contains non-molecular bonds. In fact, said H, C and O atoms may bond
into H2 and CO at the time of combustion, thus releasing extra energy. As

20

such the above two large deviations complement each other rather nicely.

It is evident that no additional quantitative study of the commercial ef-
ﬁciency of PlasmaArcFlow reactors can be done without a more accurate
knowledge of the new chemical species of magnecules, as well as a reinter-
pretation of thermochemical processes via the covering hadronic chemistry.

To heat 1 mole (i.e. 1 gram) of hydrogen from T = 300K to T = 3300K

3.5 cal/(mole K).

To heat 1 mole (i.e. 16 grams) of oxygen from T = 300K to T = 3300K

For ideal gases the heat capacity is Nk/2 per each degree of freedom of

Also, there are 3 vibrational degrees of freedom, at suﬃciently high tempera-
tures (T > 3000K). So, in total we have (about) 9 degrees of freedom. Hence,
the heat capacity of water vapor at high temperatures is 9Nk/2 = 9 cal/(mol
K). The heat required to heat up 1 mole of water vapor from T =100C =
400K to T = 3300K is thus 9 cal/(mole K)×(3300 - 400) K = 26100 cal =
26 kcal, therefore Q3 = 26 kcal.

Abstract:

In this paper we investigate the link between
classical electrodynamics and the mass-energy
equivalence principle, in view of the conclu-
sions reached in ref.[1]. A formula for the
radius of a charged particle is derived. The
formula predicts the radius of the proton cor-
rectly. The radius of the electron turns out to
be a surprising quantity that solves the exist-
ing problems of electrodynamics, particularly
the problem of the inﬁnite self-force of the elec-
tron.
In addition, the classical radius of the
electron (2.82fm) will prove to be not a “ra-
dius”, but rather the mean distance through
which the retarded potentials of the self-force
act. An important conclusion is that there is
no deﬁciency in the classical Abraham-Lorentz
model of the self-force, but rather the prob-
lem lies with our intuitive understanding of
what an elementary particle is. Other impor-
tant conclusions are also discussed, including
a physically sound explanation for why elec-

tric charges must be quantized (as opposed to
Dirac’s monopole theory).

1. Introduction:

As the very successful theory of Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED) was being developed
during the three decades that started with
Dirac’s ﬁrst paper on the subject in 1927 [2],
it was becoming clear that the major diﬃculty
that the new theory must overcome is the in-
adequacy of the classical laws of electrostat-
ics to describe electrodynamic phenomena at
In 1948, for instance, J.
the quantum level.
Schwinger wrote[3] that the fundamental con-
cepts of QED imply that “only an acceler-
ated electron can emit or absorb a light quan-
it was becoming clear during
tum”; hence,
that early period that the classical Coulomb
force of electrostatics has no existence if rel-
ative motion does not exist. That important
fact was further supported and reinforced by
the conclusions reached in ref.[1], in view of

1

the total energy equation H = mv2. Yet, de-
spite the success of QED, no suitable expla-
nation has emerged for why Coulomb’s law
(which is an undoubtedly accurate law) pre-
dicts the existence of an electrostatic force at
rest. A seemingly unrelated and still unan-
swered question was about the physical sizes of
the two most fundamental particles: the elec-
tron and the proton. Current experiments do
unanimously agree that the radius of the pro-
ton is approximately 0.87fm [4],[5], while sim-
ilar experiments for measuring the radius of
the electron have failed to agree on a unique
number. The classical radius of the electron
was known to be about 2.82fm for many years,
until recent high energy collision experiments
determined that the electron’s radius cannot
exceed 10−3fm; still, other experimental work
by Dehmelt[6] and others showed that the ra-
dius of the electron must be on the order of
10−7fm. Currently, there is no experimental
evidence to suggest other than that the elec-
tron is a structureless (point-like) Dirac par-

ticle.
other, perhaps more important issue, which is
the problem of the self energy of the electron
that has plagued QED for many years and has
necessitated the use of “renormalization” tech-
niques.
Ironically, the renormalization tech-
niques do not seem to have been taken seri-
ously even by the founders of QED. Schwinger
wrote in 1989 [7] that the problem of the self
energy is “possibly still unsolved”, while R.
Feynman wrote a few earlier[8] that “I suspect
that renormalization is not mathematically le-
gitimate. What is certain is that we do not
have a good mathematical way to describe the
theory of quantum electrodynamics”.

It is our objective in this paper to demonstrate
that all of the above problems are not only re-
lated, but in fact they are directly related to
the topic that was treated in an earlier paper

by the author[1], speciﬁcally, the misconcep-
tion that had prevailed for nearly 100 years
about what the mathematical relationship be-
tween mass and energy should be. This pa-
per is organized as follows:
in Sec.2 the to-
tal energy equation H = mv2 will be used
in the derivation of a classical mathematical
formula for the radius of a charged particle.
It will be demonstrated that the formula pre-
dicts the radius of the proton correctly. The
radius of the electron will turn out to be a
surprising quantity that solves the problem
of the inﬁnite self-force of the electron. The
classical Abraham-Lorentz model of the self-
force is also discussed in Sec.2. As we shall
demonstrate, the classical radius of the elec-
tron, or 2.82fm, will prove to be not a “ra-
dius” but rather the mean distance through
which the retarded potentials of the self-force
act. In Sec.3, the conclusions reached in Sec.2
will be applied to the case of the electron’s
wave function in the hydrogen atom; particu-
larly, to the Dirac and the Schr¨odinger mod-
els of the hydrogen atom. It will be demon-
strated that the current knowledge about the
electron’s wave function in hydrogen further
supports the conclusions reached in Sec.2. Fi-
nally, we will answer two fundamental -but
very related- questions: ﬁrst, why Coulomb’s
law of electrostatics predicts the existence of
a force between two charged particles at rest,
even though QED asserts that no such force
can possibly exist at rest. Secondly, why elec-
tric charges always appear to be quantized,
that is, appear as integer multiples of the fun-
damental electronic charge q.

In our analysis, we will refer to the electron’s
charge as “q” and to the quantity q2/4πǫ0 as
“e2”. Extension of the conclusions reached
here from the classical theory to the more elab-
orate theory of QED will be presented in a
subsequent report.

elemen-
tary particles and the divergence
problem in electrodynamics:

2.1. Radius of the electron:

The classical electromagnetic theory of the
electron emerged as an extension of the ra-
diation theories developed by Lorentz and
Poincar´e before the development of the theory
of relativity. The connection between the ra-
diation theories and the theory of the electron
was the electromagnetic energy-momentum re-
lationship. Before the discovery of relativity
by Einstein, it was demonstrated that the mo-
mentum density ~g of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
is related to the time rate of ﬂow of energy per
unit area (or the Poynting vector), ~S, by the
following relation[9]

~g =

1
c2

~S.

(1)

This relationship emerged as a direct conse-
quence of the concept that the electromagnetic
ﬁeld carries the equivalent of a mass m that is
related to the energy H stored in the ﬁeld by
the relationship m = H/c2, which was again
discovered classically before the introduction
of the theory of relativity. By using H = mc2
it is a very simple task to derive Eq.(1). When
Einstein introduced the principle of relativ-
ity in 1905 and again derived the equation
H = mc2, it was automatically assumed that
Eq.(1) must apply for material particles as well
as electromagnetic energy. The classical the-
ory of the electron was henceforth developed
on the basis of that assumption.

In the earlier paper by the author[1] it was
demonstrated that H = mc2 is indeed valid
only for the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
For matter, the correct mass-energy equiva-
lence relationship is H = mv2. In this case it

is again a very simple task to prove that

~g =

1
v2

~S.

(2)

We next consider the value of ~S. According to
classical electromagnetics, the Poynting vector
~S is given by

~S = ǫ0c2 ~E × ~B,

(3)

where ~E and ~B are the traditional electric and
magnetic ﬁeld vectors at any point in space
(note that the term c2 here results from the
application of Maxwell’s equations). We note
again that ~S represents the rate of ﬂow of en-
ergy per unit area (note that the classical elec-
tromagnetic theory of the electron makes the
assumption that the total energy of the elec-
tron is “stored” in its electric and magnetic
If we now take the expression in
ﬁelds[9]).
Eq.(3) and note, in addition, that there is a
well-known relationship between the electric
ﬁeld ~E and the magnetic ﬁeld ~B at any point
in space in the vicinity of a moving particle,
that second relationship being given by[9],[10]

~B =

c2 ~v × ~E,

(4)

where ~v is the particle’s velocity, we then have,
from Eqs.(3) and (4),

~S = ǫ0 ~E × (~v × ~E).

From Eqs.(2) and (5), the momentum density

where the symbol a designates the particle’s
radius and where we have assumed that the
sum of the momentum components in the di-
rection normal to ˆv will vanish. The inte-
gral in the above expression has already been
evaluated in a number of references[9],[11].
The result is e2/a, with an optional coeﬃ-
cient that depends on the distribution of the
charge within the volume deﬁned by the radius
a (Jackson[11], however, pointed out that if
we carry the derivation in a Lorentz-covariant
manner then the optional coeﬃcient will be in-
deed 1). Accordingly, the expression in Eq.(7)
reduces to

~p =

e2
|v|a

ˆv.

(8)

As a scalar, the momentum ~p is equal to mv,
i.e.,

|p| = mv =

(9)

.

Hence, the radius of the particle will be given
by

a =

e2
mv2 .

It is now very important to observe that
this expression is similar to the one used to
describe the classical radius of the electron

(which is given by e2/mc2), but with v2 instead
of c2 appearing in the denominator. Of course,
the quantity mv2 is just the total energy of the
particle. It is also important to note that m
here must in general be assumed to be the rela-
tivistic mass of the particle, not the rest mass.
We shall now proceed to examine the implica-
tions of the expression in Eq.(10) in the spe-
ciﬁc case of a point-like Dirac particle, such as
the electron.

2.2. Self-energy of the electron:

It will be obvious what the implication of
Eq.(10) is when diﬀerent velocities are consid-
ered. At v = 0, the radius of the electron is
inﬁnite. At v ≈ c, the relativistic mass m ap-
proaches inﬁnity, and hence the radius shrinks
to zero. The physical meaning of this sim-
ple result is the following: the radius of an
elementary particle is not a rigid quantity as
previously thought. Since such a particle can
be understood -within the framework of wave
mechanics- as a wave function, then this result
suggests that the spatial extension of the wave
function is strongly correlated with the veloc-
ity.
Indeed, this result is further conﬁrmed
if we
by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle:
can assert that the velocity of the particle is
zero, then we must conclude that the spatial
extension of the wave function is inﬁnite. In
fact, it is well known from the application of
Schr¨odinger’s equation to describe the electron
in certain conﬁgurations, such as in the hydro-
gen atom (more emphasis on that analysis is
given later), that the electron’s wave function
can extend far beyond the distance known as
the “classical” radius of the electron. When,
on the other hand, we consider the extreme of
high velocities (v → c), the wave function (and
hence the radius) shrinks to zero as we indi-
cated above. This result is of course nothing
but the well-known concept of length contrac-

(10)

4

tion of special relativity. We must now point
out that the contraction of the wave function
at high velocities oﬀers an alternative view of
why it is impossible to accelerate any particle
to a velocity beyond c. Since the wave function
shrinks to zero, Coulomb interactions with the
particle simply become impossible. The im-
portant conclusion here of course is that the
theories of special relativity and wave mechan-
ics are indeed very compatible theories, as long
as the total energy of the particle is expressed
correctly by the quantity mv2.

We shall now attempt to understand what the
above result means for the problem of the self-
energy of the electron, which is a well-known
problem of electrodynamics that remains un-
solved. As we know, the classical theory of
electrodynamics assumes that the rest mass of
the electron is due entirely to electromagnetic
eﬀects. According to the Abraham-Lorentz
model of the electron, the rest mass is rep-
resented by the expression[9]

m0 =

e2
ac2 ,

(11)

where a is the electron’s radius. Thus if a → 0,
then the “rest energy” m0c2 → ∞. This is
the well-known problem of “divergence” of the
self-energy of the electron. Let us now ex-
amine what the implication of the corrected
expression of the radius a = e2/mv2 (Eq.10)
is when the electromagnetic rest mass is con-
cerned. Obviously, the independent variable
in this case is the velocity v. As we indicated
above, if v ≈ 0 then a → ∞ and the total en-
ergy m0v2 → 0. Accordingly, the divergence
problem is eliminated at small velocities. Of
course, the rest mass m0 remains ﬁnite in this
case. As we also indicated above, if v → c,
then m → ∞ and the radius a → 0, which are
just of course the relativistic predictions. The
important result here is that the divergence

problem is eliminated at small velocities.

Another important method for calculating the
self-energy of the electron is to calculate the
energy stored in the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds generated by the particle. This energy
must still be given by the total energy expres-
sion H = mv2, and, in terms of ﬁelds, will be
given by[11]

B2)

= mv2.

µ0

radius=∞

#

radius=a

(12)

Normally, that integral is computed between
the limits a and inﬁnity.
It is well known
mathematically that if the radius a is taken to
be equal to zero the integral diverges. Given
the conclusions that we just reached, however,
we now understand that a will be equal to zero
only at very high velocities. At low velocities,
a → ∞ as we concluded and hence the numeri-
cal value of the integral will be approximately
zero. We can now see that this formulation
for the total energy (that is, in terms of ﬁelds)
is numerically in agreement with the quantity
mv2 on the r.h.s. of Eq.(12).

2.3. A better understanding of the
Abraham-Lorentz force:

Our objective now is to understand the clas-
sical Abraham-Lorentz model of the electron
in view of the conclusions reached above.
In order to better understand the Abraham-
Lorentz model, we must ﬁrst understand in
general how the derivation was performed.
The self-force is represented by the classical
Lorentz force equation[9],[11]

Fself = −

Z

d3r (ρ ~Es + ~J × ~Bs)

where ~Es and ~Bs are the self-ﬁelds of the elec-
tron and where the negative sign indicates that

is not diﬃcult to verify,
in view of Eq.(4),
that the second term in the integrand contains
terms on the order of v2/c2. If the electron is
non-relativistic (that is, v ≪ c), then it is rea-
sonable to neglect the second term. The self
force will then be given by

Fself =

(16)

where K1 and K2 are numerical constants. In
this classical expression, K1 = 2/3 due to
the fact that the theory in not Lorentz co-
variant in form. However,
it has also been
demonstrated[11] that a Lorentz covariant
form of the theory will yield K1 = 1. Eq.(16)
is the classical Abraham-Lorentz expression
of the self-force. As it is well known, the
whole diﬃculty behind the divergence prob-
lem in this classical theory as well as in QED

lies with the numerical value that we must as-
sign to the distance R. In the above deriva-
tion, R must be strictly understood as the av-
erage distance through which the retarded po-
tentials φ and ~A act. Intuitively, if we think
of the electron as a rigid, charged sphere, then
it is very reasonable to assume that R = a,
or the radius of the particle. But if we reach
the conclusion that the radius a can be very
inﬁnite if v ≈ 0), then how
large (in fact,
R can be understood? In the expressions in
Eq.(15), the distance R is the average distance
through which the retarded potentials prop-
agate from a charge ρ(x′, y′, z′, t′) to another
charge ρ(x, y, z, t) such that the two charges
are inside each-other’s light cone (we have to
stress here that the classical model is not rel-
ativistic, and hence lacks Lorentz covariance,
but this statement is generally true). R then
must be a distance that guarantees that the
necessary condition of Lorentz invariance is
not violated. Another obvious problem with
a very large radius is the shielding eﬀect of a
group of charges upon any given single charge.
In other words, any given charge ρ(x′, y′, z′, t′)
can only communicate its retarded potentials
to a limited number of other charges that ef-
fectively form a “shield” around that charge.
The mean distance through that shield must
obviously be ﬁnite and limited. Given these
two important restrictions, we have no choice
but to conclude that the average distance R
is not the radius of the particle. The question
now is, what is the numerical value of R? Since
the classical theory suggests (and in fact the
theory of QED asserts) that all the observed
mechanical mass m0 of the electron is electro-
magnetic in origin, then the term e2/Rc2 in
Eq.(16) must represent that mass. Therefore
we have

R =

e2
m0c2 = 2.82 fm

(17)

6

This famous result was well known before the
theory of relativity was discovered and was as-
sumed to represent the “radius” of the elec-
tron (note that here, again, the term c2 had
emerged from the application of Maxwell’s
equations, not from special relativity).
It is
now clear that this numerical value of 2.82fm
does not represent a “radius”, but it is actually
the mean distance through which the retarded
potentials propagate, given the physical re-
strictions mentioned above. The actual radius
of the electron will be as given by Eq.(10).

2.4. Radius of the proton:

As we know, the proton is not a point-like
Dirac particle but is composed of partons (the
quarks). The wave function of such a compos-
ite particle, therefore, can be described as an
eigenstate of two ﬁelds: a near-ﬁeld and a far-
ﬁeld. From a large distance, the proton will be
seen as a point-like particle and its radius will
be perceived as described above. This is the
far-ﬁeld radius. At a very short distance, how-
ever, the radius will be modiﬁed by an uncer-
tainty term that is caused by the movement of
the partons. This is the near-ﬁeld radius and
is the one that is usually measured in high-
energy collision experiments. At high ener-
gies, the radius given by Eq.(10) will be ap-
proximately zero as we indicated earlier. The
near-ﬁeld radius of the proton will be therefore
a+∆a, where a ≈ 0. The task now is to deter-
mine the value of the uncertainty term ∆a that
is caused by the movement of the quarks. We
shall verify that this value matches precisely
the modern value of 0.87fm, which is known
as the “radius of the proton”[4],[5].

Using Eq.(10), the uncertainty in the radius
∆a can be written as follows

∆a =

e2
∆(mv2)

=

e2
∆p∆v

,

(18)

where ∆(mv2) is the uncertainty in the to-
tal proton’s energy and where ∆p and ∆v are
the uncertainties in the momentum and ve-
locity, respectively. The jet experiments at
DESY[12] and CERN[13] in the early 1980s
showed that the transverse hadrons (q ¯q pairs)
resulting in high-energy proton-antiproton col-
lision experiments had a transverse momen-
tum of 450Mev/c on the average; which means
an average transverse momentum of 225Mev/c
for a single quark. We will now assume that
this value, 225Mev/c, is the value of ∆p that
we are seeking. The remaining task is to ﬁnd
the value of ∆v. Following the guidelines of
QED, the uncertainty in the quark’s velocity
∆v must be on the order of αc, where α is the
ﬁne structure constant; that is,

∆v = αc =

c =

Substituting for the values of ∆p and ∆v in

This number is of course the currently ac-
cepted value of the proton’s radius. It must be
therefore now clear that this value represents
not the proton’s radius, but more accurately
the uncertainty in the radius due the motion
of the partons. It is also interesting to note,
from Eq.(18), that

which is just of course Heisenberg’s uncer-
tainty principle. Accordingly, it must be fur-
ther clear that Eq.(18) is in agreement with
the known laws of quantum mechanics.

3. The electron in the hydrogen
atom and a deeper understand-
ing of the Coulomb force:

There is a very interesting observation to be
made about the radius of the electron in a
Bohr orbit. In a Bohr orbit, the electron is in
equilibrium due to the equality of the Coulomb
and the centrifugal forces acting on it, that is,

e2
R2 =

mv2
R

,

For
the electron in the hydrogen atom,
Dirac[14] had proposed that the electron’s
wave function ψ must be an eigenstate of two
radial functions ψa and ψb, such that

ψa = f e−γR,

ψb = g e−γR,

(23)

where γ is a constant and where f and g are
s CsRs, g =
power series of the form f =
sRs. Moreover, the general assumption is
that one of the two wave functions dominates
P
greatly over the other, hence,

s C ′

P

ψ ≈ (

CsRs) e−γR

(24)

s
X

The question now is how can we relate the
physical dimensions of the electron to this
representation of its wave function? Dirac
pointed out that the series

(22)

where R is the radius of the orbit. Therefore
R = e2/mv2. But this quantity is numerically
the same as the radius a of the electron given
by Eq.(10). Hence, an electron in a Bohr’s
orbit has a radius that is precisely equal to
the radius of the orbit! The question now is
why this is the case? Before we answer that
question, however, we will ﬁrst demonstrate
that this simple result is indeed distinguish-
able not just from Bohr’s model, but further
from Dirac’s and Schr¨odinger’s models of the
hydrogen atom. We will then discuss the re-
lationship between this result and Coulomb’s
law of force and derive a very important phys-
ical limitation on Coulomb’s law that was pre-
viously unknown. Finally, we will reach a
physically sound explanation for why electric
charges always appear to be quantized.

3.1. Relationship between the electron’s
radius and Dirac’s model of the hydro-

f = Cs0Rs0 + Cs1Rs1 + . . . + CsnRsn

(25)

must converge for small R as well as for large
R. At the point where R = a (the radius of
the particle), the series must therefore vanish.
We will take as a special case the case of the
hydrogen atom in the ground state to see if
in fact the radius of the electron is equal to
the radius of the orbit. For the ground state,
n = 1 and sn = n + s0 = 1 + s0 (see also the
analysis in ref.[15]). Hence, at the point where
R = a, we must have the condition

f (a) = Cs0as0 + Cs1a1+s0 = 0.

(26)

Solving for a gives a = −Cs0/Cs1. Dirac[14]
ratio
did in fact demonstrate
−Cs0/Cs1 is equal to ¯h2/me2 = e2/mv2 (note
that v = e2/¯h in a Bohr’s orbit).
In other

that

the

8

words, Dirac proved that the ratio of the ﬁrst
two constant coeﬃcients in the series is numer-
ically equal to Bohr’s orbit (0.53 Angstroms).
But we just demonstrated that the electron’s
wave function will vanish precisely at the point
where R = −Cs0/Cs1; hence, the electron’s
wave function must be contained within a ra-
dius of 0.53 Angstroms. This conﬁrms the re-
sult reached previously in the case of the sim-
ple Bohr model.

3.2. Relationship between the electron’s
radius and the classical (Shr¨odinger)
model of the hydrogen atom:

It is well known[16],[17] that by applying
Schr¨odinger’s equation to the case of the elec-
tron in the hydrogen atom, the Bohr en-
ergy levels are obtained by means of a purely
wave-mechanical analysis. We are now con-
cerned about how such an analysis could lead
to conclusions about the physical dimensions
of the electron (or the wave function, in the
wave-mechanical sense). If we write the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation

i¯h

∂ψ
∂t

= H ψ

(27)

and its solution

ψ = ψ0 exp(−

Hdt),

(28)

i
¯h Z

we ﬁrst ask what conclusion can be made if
we assume that the electron is in a stable or-
bit? Obviously, we must be assuming that the
wave function ψ = ψ0 (i.e., a constant, or sta-
ble wave function that does not evolve over
time). Hence, the conclusion that we must
make is that the total energy of the electron H
is zero everywhere along the path of the elec-
tron. This conclusion is not surprising and was
in fact reached previously in ref.[15], through

an entirely diﬀerent reasoning procedure (the
physical explanation is given in that paper).
Now, the classical Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian is

H = −

∇2 + V

(29)

This Hamiltonian represents the sum Ki-
netic Energy + Potential Energy, and is the
one used in the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger
The use of the non-relativistic
equation.
Schr¨odinger equation in the case of the hy-
drogen atom then directly leads to the classi-
cal Bohr energy levels. To write Schr¨odinger’s
equation in a manner that takes mass-energy
equivalence into account, the Hamiltonian will
be

H = −

where we have replaced the kinetic energy
1/2 mv2 by the total energy mv2. But since
the total energy is equal to zero, then we must
have

−

To solve for ψ0, we must replace the operator
∇2 by its equivalent expression in spherical co-
ordinates, and substitute for the potential V
by the traditional quantity −e2/R. The pro-
cess or replacing ∇2 by its equivalent expres-
sion in spherical coordinates is well known in
the literature[16],[17], and we simply write the
result:

(32)

Here, ψ0(R) is the radial component of ψ0
and l is the usual quantum number. Typi-

9

cally, a second equation is needed to solve for
the spherical-harmonic component of ψ0, but
since this solution is well known in the litera-
ture it will not be discussed here. The usual
approach for solving Eq.(32) is to let the prod-
uct Rψ0(R) be equal to another function, say
Γ(R). Eq.(32) is then rewritten as

− Γ′′(R) +

l(l + 1)

Γ(R) = 0

(33)
The quantity me2/¯h2 is just the inverse of the
Bohr radius and is known to emerge in the
Schr¨odinger equation for hydrogen.
In prac-
tice, the actual radius of the orbit is n2 times
the Bohr radius, and hence we must replace
me2/¯h2 by me2/(n2¯h2) in order to obtain so-
lutions for the states where n > 1. We will
use the symbol a to represent the radius of
the orbit (without making any assumptions at
this time about the physical dimensions of the
electron). Hence,

Γ(R) = 0 (34)

We will now seek to obtain a power series so-
lution for Γ(R) (in practice, we know that the
solution is better represented by a power series
in R multiplied by an exponential, however,
merely a power series representation will lead
to very important conclusions). The solution
itself is a simple, but rather lengthy and unin-
formative mathematical exercise; we just give
the result:

is exactly what we would expect if the wave

function is to be contained within a radius
a.
In the region where 0 < R < a, the se-
ries is ﬁnite; but if R > a, the series diverges,
which indicates a physically unrealizable con-
dition. In summary: ψ(0) = 0, ψ(R) =ﬁnite
for 0 ≤ R ≤ a, ψ(a) = 0 and ﬁnally ψ(R) = ∞
for R > a. This clearly indicates that the
wave function is deﬁned only in the region
0 ≤ R ≤ a.

From the above analysis it is evident that the
spatial extent of the electron’s wave function
must be conﬁned within the Bohr radius (or
n2 times the Bohr radius, for n > 1). This
is the same result obtained previously in the
case of the Dirac model. Both of these results
conﬁrm and explain the earlier result, which is

10

the fact that the mathematical expression for
the radius of the electron is the same as that
for the orbit. In addition, this reinforces the
concept that the “radius” of the particle es-
sentially means the “spatial extent of the wave
function”.

Note that we have reached the above math-
ematical results without making an attempt
to understand or describe what a wave func-
tion physically is. The reader who is inter-
ested in intuitive ideas of what a wave function
physically is can refer to the very interesting
papers by Dmitriyev[18] and by Bohun and
Cooperstock[19].

3.3. The concept of “Force” in electro-
dynamics versus electrostatics:

As we indicated earlier, since the early days of
the theory of QED it became known that no
exchange of force between two charged par-
ticles is possible unless relative motion be-
tween the particles is present; yet, to date,
no suitable explanation has emerged for why
Coulomb’s law predicts the existence of an
electrostatic force at rest. The important
question that must then be addressed is: how
the concept of “force” should be treated math-
ematically within the modern theories of elec-
trodynamics? In the classical theory of elec-
trostatics, the electric ﬁeld intensity ~E is de-
ﬁned as the force exerted on a unit charge
placed in that ﬁeld. The terms “electric ﬁeld
intensity” and “force” are therefore two equiv-
alent statements. Feynman was one of the
few QED theorists who realized early on that
the concepts of “force” and “ﬁeld” must be
separated[2]. As we know today, in macro-
scopic electrostatics, the force that exists be-
tween two charged objects is in reality due to
the exchange of quantum force carriers, or vir-
tual photons, between electrons which are ac-

tually in a state of relative motion (that is,
in atomic orbits). This fact wasn’t of course
known to Coulomb when he discovered his fa-
mous inverse square law of electrostatics. Only
in the 1940s it became accepted that the exis-
tence of a “ﬁeld” between two charged parti-
cles does not mean the existence of a “force”
and it was then when Schwinger wrote[3] that
“only an accelerated electron can emit or ab-
sorb a light quantum”. Hence, it became clear
that the electrostatic “ﬁeld” is an abstract
concept that provides a mathematical tool for
calculating the Coulomb force, but does not
by itself constitute a physical entity that ex-
ists at every point in space as classical electro-
statics suggests. Even though Feynman and
Schwinger realized this fact, it was still very
diﬃcult to eliminate the ﬁeld concept entirely,
due to its necessity in making the calculations.

It is our objective in this section to demon-
strate that not just the electrostatic ﬁeld is an
abstract concept, but so is the concept of the
electric “charge”. Indeed, we will demonstrate
that if we combine classical mechanics with
the electromagnetic mass of the electron ac-
cording to Eq.(10), Coulomb’s force equation
is generated directly, thus eliminating both of
the concepts of “ﬁeld” and “charge”. A much
better understanding of the laws of electrostat-
ics and particularly of the Coulomb force will
then emerge.

We will consider ﬁrst the motion of an electron
of a charge q in the vicinity of a larger positive
charge Q. For simplicity we will consider only
the case of a stable orbit (e.g., circular). By
using Eq.(10) to represent the electromagnetic
mass as a function of the radius, the centrifu-
gal force acting on the electron will be given
by

(38)

The expression in Eq.(38) is an electrostatic
force equation that is similar, but not math-
ematically identical, to the Coulomb force.
Since we have no experimental evidence to
suggest that Coulomb’s law is invalid, we ask,
how Coulomb’s law can be obtained from the
above expression? Obviously,
if we choose
a = R/Z, where Z is an integer, then we have

F =

Z q2
4πǫ0 R2 ,

(39)

which is
the commonly known form of
Coulomb’s law. There is, however, an im-
portant diﬀerence between this formula and
Coulomb’s law. This diﬀerence is not a mathe-
matical diﬀerence but rather a conceptual one:
at rest, the radius of the electron a → ∞,
hence we must conclude that Z → 0 and there-
fore F = 0 at rest. Accordingly, the important
diﬀerence between Eq.(39) and Coulomb’s law
is that Z must be allowed to have the numer-
ical value of 0!

It is already clear from this expression, since
Coulomb’s law has been generated automat-
ically without the necessity for a ﬁeld equa-
tion, that the concept of “ﬁeld” is indeed an
abstract concept. Let us now examine how we
can also make the conclusion that the electric
“charge” is an abstract concept. As the QED
theorists knew, the carrier of the Coulomb
force is the quantum of electromagnetism, that
is, the photon. The conclusion that emerged
during the 1940s that no light quanta are ex-
changed at rest now becomes, in view of the
above, equivalent to: “no light quanta are ex-
changed when the integer Z = 0”.
In this

12

case, we ask the question: what does the inte-
ger Z represent? It must represent the number
of light quanta exchanged. For instance, two
charges of magnitudes Z1q and Z2q will ex-
change Z = Z1Z2 light quanta. At rest, no
light quanta are exchanged and hence Z = 0.
This conclusion therefore gives Coulomb’s law
its usual mathematical expression (Eq.39) in
addition to explaining why no force exists at
rest.

We can now see that the abstract concept of
the “ﬁeld”, deﬁned mathematically by Gauss’
law as E = q/4πǫ0R2, had to be combined
with the abstract concept of the “charge”, de-
ﬁned mathematically as Q = Zq,
in order
to generate Eq.(39). These are the concepts
that we are used to in classical electrostatics.
The underlying physics, however, can be sim-
ply stated as follows: the electrostatic force
F between any two “charges” is always quan-
tized in units of e2/R2. The quantum num-
ber Z is the number of light quanta, or force
carriers, exchanged between the two charges
(note that the energy content of each light
quantum has to be equal to e2/R). This ex-
plains why any conventional charge always ap-
pears “quantized”. Clearly, the quantization
of the force, because of the discrete nature
of the photons, is the more fundamental con-
cept. Hence, it is now clear that the concepts
of “ﬁeld” and “charge” are both abstract con-
cepts indeed.

Perhaps the only concept that is radically new
here is the concept of the quantization of the
radius. But we recall again that the radius
essentially describes the spatial extent of the
wave function. Accordingly, the quantization
of both the force (in units of e2/R2) and the
spatial extension of the wave function is all
what is needed to describe a Coulomb interac-
tion. It is important to note that in the case of

a non-stable orbit the radius will not be quan-
tized as described above; that is, the force in
Eq.(38) can actually be larger or smaller than
the Coulomb force.

When we apply the force expression given by
Eq.(39) to the case of the hydrogen atom (sta-
ble orbit), we note that Z = 1 for hydrogen.
Since we have assumed that a = R/Z, then
we must conclude that a = R; that is, the ra-
dius of the electron in the hydrogen atom is
precisely equal to the radius of the orbit. This
is of course the conclusion that was reached
previously from the Bohr model.

4. Summary:

By using the total energy equation H = mv2
the outstanding problems of electrodynamics
are essentially eliminated. We have demon-
strated that the radius of an elementary parti-
cle such as the electron is not a “rigid” quan-
tity as previously thought, but is rather a func-
tion of the velocity. This conclusion results in
the successful elimination of the “divergence”
problem of the self force of the electron.
In
addition, it indicates that the concept of “ra-
dius” is essentially a description of the spatial
extent of the wave function. Moreover, the
well-known distance of 2.82fm, long believed
to represent the radius of the electron, proved
to be not a radius but rather the mean dis-
tance through which the retarded potentials
of the self force act.

Important conclusions about the physical di-
mensions of the electron in the hydrogen atom
were made. Essentially, we have concluded
that the electron’s wave function must be to-
tally conﬁned within the radius deﬁned by the
Bohr orbit. This conclusion was veriﬁed from
the Bohr, Dirac and Schr¨odinger models of the

hydrogen atom. Moreover, if we introduce the
postulate that the radius of the electron in a
Coulomb interaction must be quantized, this
directly leads to the Coulomb force equation
without reliance on the classical laws of elec-
trostatics. In view of this, two other important
conclusions were made: ﬁrst, that the integer
Z in the Coulomb force equation must have
the numerical value of 0 at rest. Secondly, the
concept of the “electric charge” proved to be
an abstract concept, just like the “ﬁeld” con-
cept.
In reality, what occurs in a Coulomb
interaction is an exchange of a number Z of
virtual photons, or force carriers, where the
energy content of each force carrier is always
equal to e2/R, regardless of the physical na-
ture of the particle emitting that carrier. It is
then due to the quantum nature of this fun-
damental boson of electromagnetism that any
charge must appear to be “quantized”. Hence,
the quantization of the force, not the charge,
is the more fundamental physical description
of the Coulomb interaction.

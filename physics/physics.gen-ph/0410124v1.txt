A modest aim of this pedagogical presentation is to analyze, critically, certain fundamental phys-
ical concepts to illustrate the physical principles behind the special theory of relativity and, hence,
to also illustrate the limitations of its applicability.

————————————————–

It was in 1905 that Einstein’s monumental work
titled Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K¨orper (On
the electrodynamics of moving bodies) appeared in
print in Annalen der Physik - a German journal of
research in physics [1] . This fundamentally impor-
tant research work is the reason behind our present
endeavors. It would then be also appropriate if, on
this occasion, we pause to take due cognizance of
the formation and the development of some funda-
mental ideas in Physics. It is therefore my modest
aim to present here a critical analysis of certain
fundamental physical concepts in relation to the
special theory of relativity and thereby to illustrate
the physical principles as well as the limitations of
the applicability of this theory.

Our this critical analysis must begin with the
formation and sharpening of some fundamental
physical concepts that took place during Newton’s
times. It is during this Golden Era of Science that
many gifted scientists conceived, formulated and
deﬁned sharply some of the fundamental physical
concepts that we use today.

Probably, most of us use these fundamental con-
ceptions without realizing the great struggles lead-
ing ultimately to their accepted meaning. As a
consequence, most of us, probably, also accept the
generalizations of these conceptions uncritically.
As a consequence, an impression may also be left
with us that some concepts are unchangeable and
must always hold. Perhaps, it is also why we, many
times, rigidly adhere to them even beyond their
natural applicability.

A primary concept of Physics is that of the in-
ertia of a material body. Ordinarily, a body needs
to be “pushed” to produce its motion. It then dis-
plays the inertia or lethargy to move.

Here, motion is to be conceived as a change in
the position of the material body in relation to the
experimenter or the observer. Then, speed is the
rate of change of position of a material body with
time. It characterizes the motion of that material
body in relation to the experimenter - the observer.
Therefore, the inertia and the speed of a material
body are physical conceptions that we have derived
from our ordinary, day to day, experiences involv-
ing physical bodies.

We could then postulate that every material body
has this inertia for motion and that some “push” is
always required to move any material body. This
is a generalization that we make about all the con-
ceivable physical bodies.

We could then state that a physical or a material
body continues to remain in its state of rest relative
to an observer or the experimenter unless and until
it is acted upon by a “push” - an external agency
or the cause of the motion. This statement could
be taken as a physical law - the Law of Inertia of
material bodies.

In fact, this above was taken to be the statement
of the Law of Inertia at the beginning of the afore-
mentioned golden era of science. The quantitative
measure of this inertia was then called the mass,
denoted by m, of that material body.

From our ordinary experiences, we could then
also assert that the mass m of a physical body
is always a positive real number since we do not,
ordinarily, encounter a physical body that “aids”
the “push” producing its motion.

[Then, a body that displays properties contrary
to related ordinary experiences could be considered
to possess negative mass. However, to this date, no
such material body is known to exist.]

On the face value, there does not appear to be
anything problematic with this statement of the
Law of Inertia of material or physical bodies. How-
ever, Galileo Galilei of Pisa in Italy was the one to
sharpen [2] this conception on the basis of certain
experiments conducted by him.

Galileo’s greatness lies not only in conceiving
these experiments but also in developing further
the concept of the inertia for motion on their ba-
sis. Before him, the emphasis was on philosophical
considerations of natural phenomena. Galileo sup-
ported his philosophy with appropriate experimen-
tations and observations. It is a change of attitude
from only “philosophical” analysis to veriﬁable
or scientiﬁc analysis.

Galileo observed that when we place a material
body on an inclined plane, it has tendency to de-
scend down it. An idea then occurred to Galileo of
placing another inclined plane next to the ﬁrst one
in such a manner that the descending body would
climb up this second inclined plane.

He observed that the material body climbs the
second inclined plane up to the height above the
ground from which it was released on the ﬁrst in-
clined plane, this when the surfaces (of contact
between the plane and that material body) were
made smooth, that is to say, as frictionless as pos-
sible. Galileo, as extraordinarily gifted scientist as
he was, then conceived a series of careful experi-
ments to test how far up the second inclined plane
the material body climbs when the angle of incline
of that second plane is changed.

He then noticed that as the second inclined plane
is made more and more horizontal, tangent to the
surface of the Earth, the material body travels
larger and larger distance along this plane but
reaches the same height from which it was released
on the ﬁrst inclined plane.

He also noticed that the material body possesses,
relative to the experimenter or the observer in the
laboratory, the same speed, say, v, at the bottom of
the inclined plane when the height from which it is
released on the plane is the same, this irrespective
of the angle of incline of the plane. The speed v
was also found to vary with the (square root of the)
height from which the material body was released.
Moreover, he also noticed that this speed v is the
same for diﬀerent material bodies (wooden, iron,
glass etc.) under the same situations.

[In modern terms, the total energy E is con-
served in the situation. Then, if mass of the ma-
terial body is m, its height above the ground is h
and g is to denote the acceleration due to gravity
then, the material body has E = mgh to begin
with since it begins from the state of rest at height
h above the ground. At the bottom of the inclined
plane, this potential energy is converted into ki-

2

netic energy of the body: mv2/2. Equating the
two, we obtain: v = √2gh, an expression indepen-
dent of the mass of the material body but varying
as the square root of the height h. Of course, this
holds only in the absence of friction.]

Galileo, then, logically argued: if the second in-
clined plane (of inﬁnite spatial extent) were made
completely horizontal, ie, exactly tangent to the
surface of the Earth, then, the material body de-
scending down the ﬁrst inclined plane would travel
an inﬁnite distance rectilinearly along the second
inclined plane with the uniform speed v. By vary-
ing the height at which the material body is re-
leased on the ﬁrst inclined plane, we would also
obtain diﬀerent uniform speeds v.

The uniform rectilinear motion of a material
body relative to an experimenter therefore has no
special status. A material body, as it reaches in-
ﬁnite separation from the Earth, moves with uni-
form speed even when there is no “push” acting
on it relative to the experimenter.

(The existence of an inﬁnite plane is an obvious
impossibility. But, a reader of Galileo is compelled
to draw the above conclusion.)

We should then state that a physical or a ma-
terial body continues to remain in its state of rest
or of uniform rectilinear motion relative to an ob-
server or the experimenter unless and until acted
upon by “push” - an external agency or the cause
of the motion. Here, we may add further that the
material body under considerations be also far re-
moved from other physical bodies in the universe.
This is then the correct Law of Inertia of material
or physical bodies.

[The “correctness” of this law of inertia is as far
as Galileo’s aforementioned experiments are con-
cerned. We also note here that if some material
body were found to move with the same uniform
speed relative to all the experimenters or observers
then, that body would have zero inertia in the sense
described above. Nothing of Galileo’s conceptions
prevents the existence of such material bodies. We
will return to this issue.]

It is our routine to state this law - Newton’s First
Law of Motion - in this form. We mostly learn it
as a statement of facts without, perhaps, learning
this interesting history.

However, in Galileo’s times, he had to struggle
[9] to establish it. Genuinely speaking, it was not
any easy to realize to eliminate friction from the
experimental setup.
In fact, elimination of fric-
tion is really the key element of Galileo’s experi-
ments. If we do not eliminate friction then, a con-
stant “push” is evidently needed to make a mate-
rial body move with “uniform” speed. Importance
of this fact must be adequately recognized by any
student of physics.

Today, the word inertia has associated with it
the meaning of the opposition of a material body
to a change in its state of rest or of uniform motion
of rectilinear character.

[At this place, let us also note that one of the
problems of foremost importance for the present
Physics is to “explain” the origin of inertia of
material bodies.]

Clearly, the next primary conception is that of
the “push” or the “external inﬂuence” that causes
the motion of a physical body. This concept is
then related to the concept of change in the state
of motion (as deﬁned, to begin with, in the Law
of Inertia that we have stated earlier) of a mate-
rial body. Then, much of what we shall consider
next will deal with the conceptions of what this
“push” means and also of what we really mean by
a “material” body.

Now, let us move on to consider some more ideas.
Even before Newton, many others had realized the
importance of the concept of inertia as a funda-
mental property of physical bodies. Then, eﬀorts
began to obtain the Laws of Motion using this fun-
damental conception.

In this connection, Descartes then made the
mathematical construction of the Cartesian coordi-
nate system. He realized that, to locate a material
body, we require three suitable numbers in rela-
tion to another material body. In his mathematical
construction, Descartes selected a point as the ori-
gin of the coordinate system and chose the three
numbers such that the distance of another point
from the chosen origin is the Euclidean distance:
x2 + y2 + z2 where x, y, z denote the coordinates
of the point in relation to the origin and the three
coordinate axes which are perpendicular to each
other and meeting at the origin.

We must realize here that this above is entirely
a mathematical construction and that it has no
physical implications. That is to say, we can con-
sider a triplet, (x, y, z), of three real numbers and
consider that they form the (Euclidean) function:
x2 + y2 + z2 which remains invariant when the
triplet is changed to, say, (x′, y′, z′).

[The transformations which keep invariant the
Euclidean distance x2 + y2 + z2 are called Galilean
Transformations. They form, mathematically, a
group - called the Galilean Group. This group con-
sists of translations of coordinates and rotations of
the cartesian coordinate system.]

Now, as a crucial step, let us represent a material
body as a material point in this cartesian system.
Then, let m be its mass or inertia.
In order to
describe its motion, we must give the values of its
coordinates as functions of the time.

But, we must be really careful here in these as-

sociations of physical character.

3

Firstly, we must remember that real material
bodies are not point-like but possess spatial exten-
sion. Therefore, our this representation of a ma-
terial body as a point is, in reality, an idealization
in which we simply replace that extended physical
body by a suitable point, let us call it the center of
inertia, to which we attribute the entire mass m of
that material body.

Whether the above idealization “correctly” rep-
resents real material bodies is to be checked only
by “experimentations” involving real material bod-
ies. That is, by verifying whether the real material
body follows the “path of the center of inertia” in
an experimental situation.

Further, the Laws of Motion obtainable on the
basis of these considerations must “demonstrate”
that this replacement of an extended material body
by a single material point is indeed true in that the
path of the material point (as the center of iner-
tia) must be obtainable from the paths of motions
of other material points (being considered to form
the material body). That is, the Laws of Motion
must be consistent with the concept of the center
of inertia. This signiﬁes the internal consistency of
the associated ideas.

Secondly, it is also necessary for us to realize that
the “time” here must be measurable by a physi-
cal clock. That is to say, the position of a mate-
rial point is to be checked against the reading of a
physical clock. Thus, we have to say that when the
material point is at such and such location given
by the three cartesian space coordinates, the phys-
ical clock is simultaneously showing such and such
time. This simultaneity is inherent in these physi-
cal associations.

If this simultaneity is not assumed then, there is
no genuine physical sense in saying that the mate-
rial point has the corresponding position. Further-
more, in the absence of any correspondence with
a physical clock, the “time” is simply a label or a
parameter (taking real values) and any other arbi-
trary label would equally do. Time is also a param-
eter that is independent of the cartesian space co-
ordinates. It is, therefore, an implicit assumption
in these considerations that such a correspondence
with a physical clock exists and can be made, as
and when desired.

Then, we have the concept of the speed of the
material body: the rate of change of its (Euclidean)
distance (in relation to the origin of the coordinate
system) with respect to the time.

Now, in Newton’s times, collisions of material
bodies were considered to be the simplest interac-
tion between them. Collision changes the (initial)
speeds of material bodies. Then, the above consid-
erations could be “applied” to collision of material
bodies to test their usefulness.

In other words, what we look here for are some
universal laws which hold in a collision of material
points and verify these laws in an actual collision
of material bodies.

Descartes then conceived the quantity of motion:
mv and stated that this quantity is conserved in
a collision of material bodies. Descartes’s asser-
tion could not hold. [Notice that speed is a scalar
quantity. It was yet to be realized that we need
a vector quantity - velocity - that has amplitude
as well as direction. Obviously then, Descartes’s
assertion could not have been true.]

Huygens, on the other hand, realized that the
quantity mv gets conserved in a collision only if we
assign to it a positive or negative sign in a suitable
manner by a convention.

So, consider the collision of two material points,
initially located on the X-axis, with motions com-
pletely along the X-axis. Let the material point m1
move away from the origin towards the direction
of the positive X-axis with initial speed vi
1 with
positive sign and let the material point m2 move
closer to the origin, ie, towards the direction of the
negative X-axis, with initial speed vi
2 with negative
sign. Let the directions of motion of involved mate-
rial points be reversed as a result of their collision.
Then, let their speeds after the collision be vf
1 with
negative sign and vf
2 with positive sign. Then, as
Huygens showed, in this case, we obtain the result:
m1vi
1

1 + m2vf
2 .
As we realize today, this above is a correct result.
It is an application of the Law of Conservation of
Linear Momentum.

It is within this scheme of physical conceptions
that Newton developed the theoretical foundation
for his famous three Laws of Motion.

Now, Galileo did not state the Law of Inertia
of Material Bodies in the ﬁnal form as we have
done. It was Newton who stated it, in his famous
book, The Principia, as the First Law of Mechanics
developed by him. That is why we call it Newton’s
First Law of Motion.

From the Euclidean geometry and the “associa-
tion” of the inertia of a material body with a point,
material point, of the Euclidean space, it is clear
that the motion of a material body is representable
as a curve in this geometry.

A material point moving with, for example, uni-
form rectilinear velocity along the X-axis is repre-
sentable as the “curve” X-axis.

Alternatively, diﬀerent types of curves of the Eu-
clidean geometry, straight line, circle etc. represent
then possible motions of a material body within
this newtonian scheme.

Clearly, the “push” that produces the motion
of a material body is related to some appropriate

4

property of the curve in a Euclidean geometry. It
was “the mathematical genius” - Newton - who
realized what this property really is.

Let us follow Newton further from here.
Firstly, we notice that the displacement of a ma-
terial point is deﬁnable as a tangent to the curve
in this Euclidean geometry. But, velocity is the
displacement per unit time and, hence,
it also
can be considered to be tangential to the same
curve. Similarly, Descartes’s quantity of motion,
now, m~v, the momentum vector ~p, is also tangen-
tial to the same curve.

A change in the velocity vector of a material
body, the acceleration, is then a vectorial quantity.
Then, the “push” must be related, within this new-
tonian scheme, to the rate of change, with time, of
some quantity tangential to the curve. The push,
that will, henceforth, be called the force, is then
another vectorial quantity.

Almost prophetically, Newton then postulated
his Second Law of Motion that the force is equal to
the rate of change of the vector of the momentum.
In terms of our usual notations:

~F =

d~p
dt

This equation of Newton’s Second Law of Motion
appears almost prophetic because Newton could
easily have chosen the force to be proportional to
the rate of change of velocity. But, in that case,
we would have

~F =

d~p
dt

=

d(m~v)
dt

= m ~a

m

≡

d2~x
dt2

an expression that holds only when the mass or the
inertia is a constant.

What is then the source or cause of this force?
It is important to recognize that, within this new-
tonian scheme, only another material point can be
the source of this force. A material point “here”
acts on a material point “there” with the speciﬁed
force. The newtonian scheme is then an action at
a distance framework.

We can then consider a physical body as many
material points and vectorially add the forces ex-
erted by each one on the other.

Now, it remains to check whether these concep-
tions are applicable to real material bodies in that
these conceptions should be self-consistent in the
sense described earlier. Then, the center of inertia
or mass is to be obtained from a distribution of
material points and it ought to be shown that the
center of inertia follows a path that is obtainable
from the paths of motion of the material points
considered to form the material body.

It is then History that Newton analyzed related
conceptions for a situation of two material points.

An immediate question then arises of the diﬀer-
ence between the force exerted by the ﬁrst mate-
rial point on the second material point, let us call
this force the action, and that exerted by the sec-
ond material point on the ﬁrst material point, let
us call this force the reaction.

Surely, the most natural assumption here is the
equality of these two forces: action and reaction
forces. But, force is a vectorial quantity with am-
plitude and direction, both.

Newton then realized that for the internal con-
sistency of this theoretical framework it is neces-
sary that these two forces must be equal in ampli-
tude but opposite in direction. Hence, his Third
Law of Motion: Forces of Action and Reaction are
equal and oppositely directed.

It is the remarkable simplicity of the newtonian
scheme that it is based on just these three Laws
of Motion. The remaining are just deductions that
follow from these three basic laws.

On the basis of only these remarkably simple
three laws of motion, it was then possible to cal-
culate the planetary motions. It was also possible
to develop [3] the theory of tides, the theory of the
equilibrium conﬁgurations of rotating bodies, the
calculation of the speed of sound etc.

Primarily, one of the simplest forms of a general
physical law is to assert the conservation of some
physical quantity when material bodies participate
in diﬀerent physical processes. That a given physi-
cal quantity is really subject to a conservation prin-
ciple is then to be decided only by performing ex-
periments with material bodies.

It was then the great triumph of the newtonian
scheme that various experiments conﬁrmed diﬀer-
ent conservation principles of this scheme: for ex-
ample, those of the mass, energy, linear momen-
tum, angular momentum, etc.

This is the reason as to why the impact of the
newtonian scheme completely overshadowed the
developments in Physics for the next few centuries.
That the mathematical structure of the newtonian
scheme developed by many others after Newton re-
quired no new experiments or observations is tes-
timony enough to say that the physical foundation
laid by Newton was completely suﬃcient to sup-
port these developments.

This led the physicists of later generations to
the erroneous belief that the entirety of physics
could be reduced to the newtonian mechanics. In
other words, they failed to recognize clearly the
limitations of the newtonian framework as we have
outlined above in brief.

It should now be clear at this stage that the lim-
itations of Newton’s three laws of motion are really
embedded within the limitations of this newtonian
scheme itself.

5

Of particular concern are the use in this scheme
of the Cartesian conceptions of Euclidean geome-
try and the associations of properties of material
bodies with the points of this space.

In this connection, we note that the coordinate
transformations which keep the Euclidean distance
invariant are very special transformations of the
triplets (x, y, z) of real numbers. Newton’s laws of
motion are invariant only under these special (the
Galilean) transformations.

Moreover, the association of the inertia of a ma-
terial body with the points of the Euclidean space
does not produce any change in the Euclidean
space. Then, the Euclidean space is an inert back-
ground for the material bodies. This scheme then
explains all phenomena as relations between objects
existing in space and time.

A coordinate system, the construction of the co-
ordinate axes and clocks, must also be using the
material bodies. But, precisely this construction
is left outside the scope of this newtonian scheme.
Therefore, we have to treat the construction of the
coordinate system as the one using rigid rods and
clocks which never get aﬀected by anything hap-
pening with the material bodies. This must be rec-
ognized as an important and inherent drawback of
the newtonian scheme.

[Let us construct a cartesian coordinate system
using “suﬃciently long” material rods, say, of iron.
Ever imagined a heavy-duty bulldozer or road-
roller crossing, say, the rod representing the X-axis,
but “not doing anything’ to that rod?]

The cartesian coordinate system / space is then
an absolute, meaning unchanging, coordinate sys-
tem / space in this scheme.

Within Newton’s scheme, the acceleration of a
material point is, at a fundamental level, then to
be referred to only this absolute background space
or the unchanging coordinate system. Such coor-
dinate systems are then fundamental, special, to
this description of physical systems.

Consequently, in selecting any coordinate frame
accelerated with respect to the background coor-
dinate system, we will have to introduce ﬁctitious
forces, the pseudo-forces, to account for the phe-
nomena involving material bodies. For example,
in selecting a rotating frame for describing the mo-
tion of a material body, we have to introduce [3]
the notion of the Coriolis Force to account for the
“observed” phenomena.

Coordinate frames in which ﬁctitious forces do
not occur are deﬁned to be inertial frames of ref-
erence. Then, unambiguous physical construction
of inertial frames is a problem in Newton’s theory
since pseudo-forces are to be deﬁned in relation to
only these frames in this scheme. This is obviously
unsatisfactory vicious circle.

Furthermore, this scheme has four independent
coordinates: three space coordinates and one time
coordinate. This, the newtonian, scheme is there-
fore four-dimensional of character. However, it is,
not any four-dimensional distance, but, the three-
dimensional Euclidean distance that is invariant
under the galilean transformations.

A further diﬃculty of the newtonian scheme is
then the following. Clearly, for the path of a mate-
rial body, we use the space coordinates as functions
of the time coordinate. Then, mathematically, the
path of a material point is a “curve” in the four-
dimensional space of (x, y, z, t).

But, it is the peculiarity or the oddity of this
newtonian scheme that no transformations of the
time axis are, in any way, involved in it. In other
words, the time coordinate is the same for all the
observers. Why should this be so? Newton’s the-
ory oﬀers no explanation here.

Moreover, it should also be clear now that, when
m = 0, the newtonian scheme oﬀers no laws for the
motion of a material body. Clearly, ~a = ~F /m and
the acceleration has no meaning for m = 0. That is
to say, the newtonian scheme cannot describe the
motion of a material body that moves with the
same uniform speed in relation to all the (inertial)
observers. This must be recognized as a limitation
of the newtonian scheme if such inertia-less mate-
rial bodies existed in reality.

Notice, now, that the newtonian scheme is based
on two independent considerations: ﬁrst, those of
the law of motion and second, those of the law of
force. Then, unless and until we specify the force
acting on a material point, Newton’s Second Law
of Motion will be unable to provide us the path
followed by that material point.

It is precisely for this reason that Newton had to
postulate a separate Law of Gravitation - Newton’s
Law of Gravitation.

Here, Newton introduced a new notion of the
source properties of material bodies. Precisely, if
M is the source or the gravitational mass of one
material point, m is the gravitational mass of an-
other material point situated at distance d from
the ﬁrst body then, the gravitational force of at-
traction (produced by M and acting on m) is given
by the famous expression:

~Fg =

G

mM
d2

ˆd

−
where G is Newton’s constant of gravitation and ˆd
is the outwardly directed unit vector along the line
joining the two material points with origin of the
coordinates being at the location of the material
point of gravitational mass M .

Then, in this Law of Gravitation, the force varies
inversely with the square of the distance separating

6

the material points. This must be recognized as an
important assumption.

[Why not any other power of d? Why should the
expression for the force not contain any derivatives
of the space coordinates?]

Furthermore, it is essential to distinguish be-
tween the inertial mass and the gravitational mass
of a material point. These two are conceptions of
very diﬀerent physical origins.

Now, consider that various bodies of diﬀering in-
ertia fall freely under the action of Earth’s gravity
after being released from the same distance above
the ground. In terms of Newton’s Laws of Motion:
let mi be the inertial mass and mg be the gravita-
tional mass of a material body. Then, from New-
ton’s Second Law of Motion and Newton’s Law of
Gravitation, we have:

~F = mi ~a =

mg M
r2

ˆr

G

−

≡

mg ~g

where M denotes the gravitational mass of the
Earth, r is the distance to the material body from
the center of the Earth and ~g denotes the acceler-
ation due to Earth’s gravity.

Thus, the (linear) acceleration is related to the

acceleration due to gravity as:

~a =

mg
mi

~g

Now, if the ratio of mg to mi were diﬀerent for dif-
ferent material bodies then, they would fall with
diﬀerent accelerations even when released from
the same distance above the surface of the Earth.
Galileo’s experiments at the leaning tower of Pisa
showed that this is not the case.

Hence, the inertial and the gravitational mass
are equal to a high degree of accuracy for known
material bodies. This is an experimental result.
But, the fact that these two quantities are equal
must be recognized as another additional assump-
tion of the newtonian scheme.

Furthermore, it also follows that the origin of
the source properties of material bodies like the
gravitational mass is unexplainable within the new-
tonian scheme. This is so because the newtonian
scheme treats the cause of the motion of a material
body, the force, as an external agency to be pos-
tulated or speciﬁed by hand. Therefore, although
Newton’s Law of Gravitation speciﬁes the inverse-
square behavior for the force of gravity, this law
is an assumption that is not any “explanation” of
the phenomenon of gravitation.

Now, if this scheme is to be applicable to every
material body, as Newton’s First Law of Motion
asserts, then, every physical phenomenon must be
explainable as an interaction of material points. In

other words, every material body must be treatable
as a material point.

Therefore, Light must also be treatable as a ma-
terial point within this newtonian scheme. This is,
precisely, the reason behind Newton proposing the
Corpuscular Theory of Light.

Then, the observation that Light propagates in
a straight line is consistent with this picture of
Light as a material point: a material point of Light
moves in a straight line unless acted upon by a
force changing its direction of motion. The reﬂec-
tion of Light from the surface of a mirror is also
explainable on the basis of collisions of material
points of Light with the mirror.

However, it was known in those times that the
shadow of an object illuminated by Light has two
distinguishable regions: ﬁrst, the dark one, called
the Umbra and second, relatively less darker one,
called the Penumbra. Light also penetrates the geo-
metrical shadow region near the edge of the object
and diﬀracts.
In Newton’s scheme, this must be
because of some force acting on the material points
of Light. This force is then diﬀerent for diﬀerent
material points of Light since the penetration by
Light in the geometric shadow occurs at various
depths behind the object.

Also, in Newton’s own experiments with Light,
Newton observed the phenomenon of concentric
(Newton’s) rings. A bright ring is a ring-shaped
region of Light. A dark ring is another ring-shaped
region of no Light. There also are more than one
such concentric bright and dark rings. Once again,
within the newtonian scheme, this must be be-
cause of some force acting on the material points
of Light. This force is then evidently diﬀerent for
diﬀerent material points of Light.

It is then thinkable that an explanation of these
phenomena on the basis of some hypothetical force
acting on the material points of Light is obtainable
within the newtonian scheme. Any such explana-
tion is, however, unsatisfactory.

The pivotal reason for this is that any explana-
tion must be universal of character. It is only in
such a situation that the involved explanation is
also the simple one. This principle of simplicity of
an explanation has been the driving impetus be-
hind scientiﬁc theories.

In relation to the (hypothetical) force acting
on the material points of Light postulated within
the newtonian scheme, we could then ask: What
causes the required behavior of this force acting on
the material points of Light? Is there some univer-
sal, rational explanation for this?

Evidently, no such universal, rational explana-
tion is permissible in Newton’s scheme as any force
is an assumption for it. (Newton, perhaps, recog-
nized this fact.) Furthermore, the phenomenon of

7

polarization of Light has no conceivable explana-
tion in Newton’s scheme.

We have gone to great lengths in describing this
evolution of newtonian ideas here because the con-
ception of an inertia of a material body is one of
the basic concepts of even the modern physical the-
ories. Newton’s theory deals with the conception
of an inertia of a material body only in one re-
spect: by ascribing it to a point of the space. But,
the newtonian framework does not explain the ori-
gin of inertia of a material body. Clearly, this is
also an additional limitation of Newton’s theoreti-
cal framework.

For us, of much later generations, these limita-
tions of the newtonian scheme may appear obvious.
But, it must be kept in mind that many of these
limitations were pointed out during that Golden
Era of Science itself! For example, Descartes had
pointed out the rigid nature of the coordinate sys-
tem; Newton himself was uncomfortable with the
absolute nature of the space.

It was of course recognized that properties of
Light are not explainable on the basis of the Cor-
puscular Theory of Light. In particular, Huygens
developed the Wave Theory of Light on the basis
of the hypothesis that Light is, for example, like
a wave propagating in a medium - ether. It was
then possible to explain the phenomena of Light.
In particular, the polarization of Light received an
explanation with the wave theory.

However, all these limitations of the newtonian
scheme do not lessen the stature of either New-
ton as a scientist or that of Newton’s theory. The
concepts created by him, by others, as well as by
those who erected the mathematical framework for
these concepts are still important, except that we
now know their limitations.

Having presented an in-depth critique of the
newtonian theoretical framework, Einstein once
wrote [4]: Newton, forgive me; you found the only
way which, in your age, was just about possible for
a man of highest thought and creative power. The
concepts, which you created, are even today still
guiding our thinking in physics, although we now
know that they will have to be replaced by others
farther removed from the sphere of immediate ex-
perience, if we aim at a profounder understanding
of relationships. Indeed, true this.

Now, let us then turn to modiﬁcations of the
newtonian scheme that are necessary to explain
the phenomena displayed by Light.

Then, at the present stage, we know that Light
does not follow the newtonian laws of motion since
the explanations based on these laws are not satis-
factory ones. Importantly, the property of polar-
ization of Light is not even explainable within the
newtonian framework.

But, we only have two types of material bodies
left out of the newtonian scheme - those with nega-
tive inertia and those with vanishing inertia. Then,
it is thinkable that Light is one of these two types
of material bodies. This, notwithstanding Huy-
gens’s Wave Theory for Light, is an option open
for further exploration of ideas.

But, no property of Light indicates that it has
negative inertia. [For example, speed of Light does
not increase when it collides with the mirror, say.
Here is a “Push” acting on Light, but Light does
not “help” it.] Then, in Newton’s scheme, the only
option is of treating Light as a material body with
vanishing inertia.

Then, obviously with an hindsight now, we can
say that Light needs to be treated as a material
body with vanishing inertia, this if we are to fol-
low, faithfully, the overall nature of the (scientiﬁc)
development of the physical ideas beginning with
the Golden Era of Science.

But, any material body with vanishing inertia
moves with the same speed for all the inertial ob-
servers. That is, speed of a material body of van-
ishing inertia is a universal constant as far as iner-
tial observers are concerned. Then, speed of Light
(in vacuum) must be a universal constant for the
inertial observers.

Now, the Galilean transformations of coordi-
nates are clearly insuﬃcient to accommodate the
above universality of the speed of Light for the in-
ertial observers. It therefore follows that we will
have to “extend” these transformations to some
suitable others.

However, a lesson from Newton’s theory, namely
that, the laws of motion of material objects retain
their form in all inertial frames, need not be dis-
carded. (Or, equivalently, a lesson from Galileo’s
experiments that uniform rectilinear motion of in-
ertial observers has no special status.) Hence, we
should look here for those transformations of the
space and the time coordinates that keep the laws
of motion invariant.

We therefore arrive at the starting principles
used by Einstein for the formulation of his Special
Theory of Relativity:

•

•

The Principle of (Special) Relativity:
The laws of Physics (eg, of motion of material
bodies) retain the same form in all inertial
frames of reference.

The Principle of the Constancy of the
Speed of Light: The speed of Light (in
vacuum) is a universal constant (with same
value) for all the inertial observers.

8

(of the Special Theory of Relativity) would be suﬃ-
cient to provide us a logically consistent framework
for the theory.

In this connection, we note that the ﬁrst of these
two principles is, in fact, the basis of Newton’s the-
ory and, at the present stage of our theoretical con-
siderations, there do not exist any reasons to give
up this characteristic of the newtonian framework.
The second of these two postulates is a direct con-
sequence of our assumption that Light is a material
body with vanishing inertia.

The theoretical framework based on these two
principles may then be expected to provide us log-
ically consistent description of the motion of mate-
rial bodies with vanishing and non-vanishing (pos-
itive) inertia, both. In other words, we can then
expect that this theory would describe the motion
of material bodies moving not only with speed less
than but moving also with the speed of Light rel-
ative to inertial observers.

Now, by deﬁnition, we have

Speed of Light =

Light path
Time interval

Then, the required transformations of coordinates
will also involve suitable transformations of the
time coordinate when we demand the constancy
of the speed of Light for all the inertial observers.
This issue then brings us to Einstein’s analysis of
the simultaneity of events, an event being a phys-
ical happening in space at some instant of time.
Below, we follow Einstein’s original presentation
of this analysis from his 1905 paper.

At point A of space, let there be a clock using
which an observer at A determines the time values
of events in the immediate vicinity of A by associ-
ating the positions of the hands of the clock with
these events. Similarly, at another point B of the
space, let there be a clock, identical in all respects
to the clock at the point A, using which an ob-
server at B determines the time values of events in
the immediate proximity of B.

Now, it is important to recognize that we are yet
to establish the existence of a common time for the
separated locations A and B. Evidently, this is to
be done by sending (Light) signal from location A
to location B and reﬂecting it back to A so that
an observer at A can compare readings of clocks at
these separate locations.

If a ray of Light starts from A at time tA, reaches
and is reﬂected in the direction of A at B at time
tB , and arrives again at A at time t′
A then, the
clocks at A and B synchronize, show same time, if

On the basis of our considerations so far,
it
should then be expected that these two principles

Having this procedure for synchronism of clocks at

tB −

tA = t

′
A −

tB

diﬀerent space locations, we can then extend it to
all of the space.

Again, it is important to note that this above
procedure for comparing clocks at spatially sepa-
rated locations is a common, day-to-day, experi-
ence. It is by detecting a ray of Light emitted by
an object or reﬂected from an object that we “see”
that object. The above procedure is an appropri-
ate adaptation of this common experience. Then,
the adopted procedure of synchronization of clocks
is a logical abstraction derived from our this day-
to-day experience.

We therefore assume that the above deﬁnition of
synchronism of clocks is free of any contradictions
and that the following are universally valid:

•

•

Reﬂexivity of Synchronism Relation: If
the clock at B synchronizes with the clock at
A then, the clock at A synchronizes with the
clock at B

Associativity of Synchronism Relation:
If the clock at A synchronizes with the clock
at B and also with the clock at C then, the
clocks at B and C also synchronize with each
other in the above procedure

Clearly, these are assumptions and we will have

to assume their consistency.

Then, the hypothesis of the constancy of the
speed of Light, when expressed in terms of these
quantities, is

c =

2 d(A, B)
t′
tA
A −
where c is a universal constant and d(A, B) is the
“distance” separating A and B.

Here, we can clearly recognize that the newto-
nian scheme assumes an inﬁnite speed of propaga-
tion for (Light) signals. Recall that the distance
separating points A and B is the same in all the
inertial frames of reference, ie, it is an invariant
of the galilean transformations. Furthermore, the
absolute nature of time in galilean transformations
implies that t′
A = tA in all the inertial frames if it
holds in one inertial frame. Therefore, an inﬁnite
speed of propagation for signals is, in principle, al-
lowed in Newton’s theory.

Now, chose an inertial frame, to be called a sta-
tionary frame with all its paraphernalia of coor-
dinate axes, measuring rods and clocks. (Remem-
ber that the unambiguous deﬁnition of an inertial
frame is a problem in Newton’s theory. We rely
on the approximate validity of Newton’s laws of
motion for this above purpose.)

Moreover, consider a stationary rigid rod ly-
ing lengthwise along the X-axis of the stationary

9

frame; and let its length be ℓ as measured by a
measuring-rod which is also stationary in the same
frame of reference.

Next, imagine that this rigid rod is imparted a
uniform speed v along the X-axis of the stationary
frame. Then, the length of the moving rod can be
established in the following two obvious ways:

(a) The observer moves together with a measuring
rod and the rod to be measured. The length
of the rod is then obtained directly by super-
posing the measuring rod, in just the same
way as if all three were at rest. Clearly, this
length must be equal to ℓ.

(b) The observer establishes the system of station-
ary clocks and synchronizes them as per the
adopted procedure. Then, the observer as-
certains the locations of the two ends of the
rod, whose length is to be measured, in the
stationary frame at a deﬁnite time. The dis-
tance between these two points, measured by
the measuring-rod already employed, is the
length of the moving rod in the stationary
frame of reference.

To ascertain the length of the moving rod in the
stationary frame of reference, we adopt the proce-
dure (b) as follows.

Then, consider that at the ends A and B of the
rod, clocks are placed which synchronize with those
of the stationary frame. Imagine also that there is
a moving observer passing each of these clocks, and
that these observers apply the method of synchro-
nism to both the clocks.

Let a ray of Light be emitted from A at the
stationary frame time tA, let it be reﬂected at B
at time tB , and let it reach A again at time t′
A.
If RAB is the length of the moving rod measured
in the stationary frame then, from the principle of
the constancy of the speed of Light, we have

Clearly, tB −

= t′
tB . The observers
moving with the rod then ﬁnd that the two clocks
were not synchronized even when the stationary
frame had them synchronized!

A −

Consequently, it follows that there is no absolute
signiﬁcance to the concept of the simultaneity of
events under the postulate of the constancy of the
speed of Light together with the use of Light to
“measure” length and time.
But, the length, RAB 6

= ℓ, of a moving rod is
then diﬀerent in diﬀerent inertial frames in motion
relative to each other!

This, of course, is only a kinematical eﬀect with-
out any absolute signiﬁcance. That is, no “phys-
ical” change in the length of the rod is implied
here in the sense that the molecules of the body
get pressed together. Rather, it is only that the
observer for whom the rod is in motion must, for
consistency of the ideas, consider the length of the
= ℓ in physical statements
moving rod to be RAB 6
about that rod.

Here, we already see that the Laws of Motion
for material bodies with vanishing inertia, when
used as signals, have direct implications also for
the Laws of Motion for material bodies of non-
vanishing inertia. Of speciﬁc importance are the
kinematic eﬀects as above.

In Newton’s theory however, the lengths of a
rod determined from the two methods (a) and (b)
are precisely equal. As we have seen earlier, this
is a consequence of the galilean transformations
used by Newton’s theory. Therefore, the kinematic
eﬀects of Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity do
not have any newtonian analogues.

Now, let us turn to our task of ﬁnding the re-
quired transformations of coordinates consistent
with the hypothesis of the constancy of the speed
of Light. It will of course be simpliﬁed by choosing
the reference frames in some convenient manner.
This can be done as follows.

In the stationary space, consider two systems of
coordinates, each with three rigid material lines,
perpendicular to one another and issuing from a
point.
[Here, we want to emphasize the physical
nature of the construction of the coordinate sys-
tem.] Let each system be provided with rigid mea-
suring rods, alike in all respects, and clocks, which
too are alike in all respects. Let the clocks of each
of these coordinate systems be synchronized as per
the adopted procedure.

Let these coordinate systems be (x, y, z, t) and
(x′, y′, z′, t′). Let the primed (K ′) and unprimed
(K) systems coincide at t′ = t = 0. Then, let
the system K ′ (along with its entire construction
of the three rigid material lines, measuring rods
and clocks) be moving with the uniform speed v
in the direction of the positive x-axis relative to
the system K. Let the y and y′ axes be parallel to
each other and so also be the case with the z and
z′ axes, when K ′ is in motion.

Therefore, any event in the stationary space can
be unambiguously deﬁned in place and in time by
the two coordinate systems, in K by (x, y, z, t) and
in K ′ by (x′, y′, z′, t′). Our required coordinate
transformations are then the relations connecting
these coordinate quantities.

Now, since the stationary space is homogeneous
by construction, meaning no particular coordinate
location of an event is preferable over any other

10

location in it, it should be clear that the required
equations must be linear.

Furthermore, if we take ζ = x

vt, a point
at rest in K ′ must have coordinate values ζ, y, z,
independent of time t′.

From the origin of the system K ′, let a ray of
light be emitted at time t′
0 along the x-axis to ζ.
Let this ray of light be reﬂected at ζ at time t′
1,
and arrive back at the origin at time t′
2. Then, by
construction, we must have

locity c in the moving frame K ′. Expressing this in
equations will then provide us the required quan-
tities x′, y′, z′. For example, for a ray of Light

Note that an additive constant will have to be
placed on the right hand side of each of these equa-
tions if no assumptions are made as to the initial

p

Note also that these transformations must form
a (mathematical) group. Then, using some of the
group properties, in particular, the existence of an
inverse transformation, it can be easily shown that
φ(v) = 1, very generally.

Now, we have still not proved that the hypoth-
esis of the constancy of the speed of Light is com-
patible with the hypothesis of the equality of all
the inertial frames. Then, to check the internal
consistency of our formulation, we need to show it
explicitly that any ray of Light also has the same,
universally constant, speed c when measured from
the moving frame.

To this end, at t′ = t = 0, let a spherical wave of
Light be emitted from the common origin of these
two frames. Then, if c were to denote the (con-
stant) speed of Light, the equation of the spheri-
cal wavefront of Light wave in the unprimed frame
would be

x2 + y2 + z2 = c2t2

11

The relations (1), now with φ(v) = 1, are the fa-
mous Lorentz transformations with γ being called
the Lorentz factor.

These transformations were already obtained by
Lorentz and Fitzgerald, and were available in the
literature before Einstein propounded his special
theory of relativity in 1905. It should also be noted
here that Einstein was not aware [5] of these trans-
formations before 1905.

However, Lorentz and Fitzgerald, both, had in
mind the considerations related to the “ﬁctitious”
ether. Consequently, the genuine credit of showing
that these transformations are kinematical of char-
acter is entirely that of Einstein’s who also derived
these transformations on the basis of only the two
postulates mentioned earlier.

Furthermore, a special mention must also be
made of Henri Poincar´e who had realized [5] that
Newton’s laws need modiﬁcations. Therefore, in a
sense, “The solution anticipated by Poincar´e was
given by Einstein in his memoir of 1905 on special
relativity. He (Einstein) accomplished the revolu-
tion which Poincar´e had foreseen and stated at a
moment when the development of physics seemed
to lead to an impasse.”

Let us now turn to physical implications of the
Lorentz transformations. To this end, let us con-
sider a rigid sphere of radius R at rest in the mov-
ing frame K ′, a material body possessing spherical
shape when examined at rest, with the center of
the sphere being coincident with the origin of the
coordinates of K ′.

Then, the equation of the surface of this spher-
ical body moving relative to the system K with
velocity v is

′
(x

)2 + (y

′

)2 + (z

′

)2 = R2

The equation of this surface when expressed in
(x, y, z) coordinates at time t = 0 is
x2γ2 + y2 + z2 = R2

It therefore has the shape of an ellipsoid of revolu-
tion with the axes

R
γ

, R, R

at any later (unprimed) time t.

By transforming this equation with the help of
the relations (1), the equation of the same spherical
wavefront of Light in the primed frame is obtain-
able as

′

′

′
(x

)2 + (y

)2 = c2(t

)2 + (z
at any later (primed) time t′. Thus, the wave under
consideration is also a spherical wave propagating
with speed c in the moving frame.

)2

′

Therefore, to an observer in the stationary
frame, the x-dimension of the body appears to be
v2/c2. For v = c,
shortened in the ratio 1 :
all moving objects, when viewed from the “station-
ary” system, shrink into plain ﬁgures.

p

−

1

Clearly, when viewed from the moving frame,
the same result holds good for bodies at rest in
the stationary frame.

This is then the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction
of a material body in motion. It is of course only a

kinematical eﬀect. In other words, to consistently
describe the physics of these bodies an observer in
the stationary frame has to consider their short-
ened dimensions while there being no objectively
real contraction of these bodies.

Furthermore, we can now consider a clock that
marks the time t when at rest in the stationary
frame K, and the time t′ when at rest relative to
the moving frame K ′. What is then the rate of
this clock in the latter situation, relative to the
stationary frame?

Considering that the clock is at rest at the origin
of the frame K ′, we have x = vt and t′ as in (1).
Hence,

Clearly, the clock in the stationary frame K
would also run slow when viewed from the moving
frame K ′. Therefore, this is again only a kinemat-
ical eﬀect with no objectively real slowing of the
clock taking place.

Now, in Newton’s theory, two given velocity vec-
tors could be vectorially added (as 3-vectors) to
obtain the resultant velocity: ~V = ~v + ~w. This
Law of Composition of Velocities also changes un-
der the Lorentz transformations.

then, θ is the angle between the two velocity 3-

an expression which is, most often, to be found in
standard text books [3].

Clearly, in a composition of two velocities which

Furthermore, it also follows that the velocity of
Light cannot be altered by composition with a ve-
locity less than that of light:

V =

c + w
1 + w/c

= c

It is also clear that such “parallel transformations”
(all the involved velocities being in the same direc-
tion as is the case here) form a sub-group of the
full group of Lorentz transformations.

[One may now be tempted to do something like
v = c and w = c in the expression (4) and also
obtain V = c. However, one must remember that
no observer or the experimenter can move with the
speed of Light.
It therefore does not make any
sense to calculate the relative velocity between two
particles of Light as being equal to c. A student
of special relativity must be careful against some
such obvious traps.]

Now, it is clear that Maxwell’s electromagnetism
is consistent with the two postulates of the special
theory of relativity. Still, to begin with, Einstein
explicitly showed the consistency of the postulates
of special relativity and Maxwell’s theory of elec-
tromagnetism.

Consider then a ray of Light (an electromagnetic
wave) having energy E and making an angle φ with
the x-axis of the system K. Let us introduce the
system K ′ that is moving in uniform parallel trans-
lation along the x-axis of the system K with speed
v. Then, when measured by the system K ′, that
ray of Light can be shown to possess energy E′

Let the energy of the same body be Ho relative to
the system K ′ moving in parallel translation along
the x-axis of K with speed v.

Let this body now send out a ray of Light (of en-
ergy L/2 as referred to the frame K) in a direction
making an angle φ with the x-axis and, simulta-
neously, an equal quantity of Light in the opposite
direction so that the body, in the meanwhile, re-
mains at rest in the frame K. Let its energy now
be E1 relative to the system K and H1 relative to
the system K ′.

Clearly, the principle of conservation of energy
must apply to this process and, by the principle of
(special) relativity, with respect to both the iner-
tial systems K and K ′.

Then, we have the relations

E0 = E1 +

Now, the quantity H is the energy relative to

relative to the system K. Hence, H
E is the dif-
ference in energy as referred to two inertial frames
with the body being at rest in one of them. Conse-
E can diﬀer from the kinetic energy J

of the body with respect to K ′ only by an additive

That is to say, the kinetic energy of the body re-

the emission of Light and the amount of decrease
is independent of the properties of that body. It
however depends on the velocity v.

and we can now conclude that if a body gives oﬀ
energy E in the form of electromagnetic radiation,
its mass decreases by E/c2.

This is another of celebrated results of the spe-
cial theory of relativity: the equivalence of mass
and energy. Einstein obtained this result in an in-
dependent publication [6] again in 1905.

It also follows now that the inertia or the mass of
a material body depends upon its velocity relative
to the stationary frame as

m =

where mo is the mass as observed by an inertial
frame in which that material body is at rest. This
is an important result in many respects.

The reason for our adapting here Einstein’s 1905
paper is the following one. His methods are based
precisely on the way we make measurements - the
way we use Light to communicate. A critical anal-
ysis of fundamental concepts must begin with only
such considerations and then can it lead to theo-
retical advancement. (History has also shown this
before.) It will also be important at a later stage
of our present considerations.

In the early days of special relativity, this theory
was misunderstood to a large extent because kine-
matical eﬀects predicted by it were misconceived
to be objectively real. This misunderstanding then
gave rise to many paradoxes. One of the famous
early paradoxes of special relativity is known as
the Paradox of Twins.

Imagine a pair of twins borne at the same earth-
time. One of them stays on the earth and the other
travels in space for some earth-years and returns
to meet his counterpart on the earth. Will the age
of the traveller be less than that of the one who
stayed on the Earth?

It is important to recognize that this question is
unanswerable within the special theory of relativ-
ity since this situation necessarily involves “non-
inertial” frames of reference. For example, to re-
turn to the Earth, the traveller twin has to deceler-
ate and accelerate in the path. But, special theory
of relativity stays silent on as to how to deal with
such frames of reference.

Now, it should be evident as to what the limi-
tations of Einstein’s this special theory of relativ-
ity really are. Once again, noteworthy for us are
the use here of the Cartesian conceptions of Eu-
clidean geometry for the space and the associations
of properties of material bodies with the points of
that Euclidean space.

These above are essentially the same conceptions
as that of Newton’s theory. Only the coordinate
transformations used by the special theory of rel-
ativity are then diﬀerent.

It is here that we note the contributions of H
Minkowski. Minkowski showed that diﬀerent cum-
bersome formulas of special relativity can be el-
egantly recast into concise mathematical forms if
we treat the 3-space and the time as forming a
4-dimensional spacetime.

Consider diﬀerent quadruplets (x, y, z, t) of real
numbers forming a 4-dimensional (mathematical)
space endowed with a metric function:

Notice that the above metric function is not a
positive-deﬁnite one. In mathematical vocabulary,
such a metric function is called a pseudo-metric
and the corresponding space is called a pseudo-
metric space. Then, we are considering here a 4-
dimensional pseudo-metric space.

(The 4-dimensional spacetime of special relativ-

ity is therefore a pseudo-metric space.)

Let a speciﬁc point of this spacetime be called
an event. Notice that diﬀerent events can now be
classiﬁed on the basis of whether the 4-distance ds
to that event from the origin of the coordinates is
positive, zero, or negative.

When ds = 0, we call the trajectory a null tra-
jectory. When ds > 0, we call the trajectory to be
spacelike and when ds < 0, we call the trajectory
to be timelike.

[We have chosen the signature of the metric func-
). We could instead have cho-
tion to be (+, +, +,
−
sen it to be (
, +). In that case, these above
,
−
deﬁnitions of “timelike” and “spacelike” will have
to be interchanged.]

−

−

,

We call this 4-dimensional (pseudo-metric) space
the Minkowski spacetime. It is only a mathemat-
ical construction and no physical implications are
incorporated into it unless, of course, we make the
required physical associations.

Again, all these physical associations are exactly
as they were in Newton’s theory. Recollect that we
have, after all, only extended the newtonian for-
malism to material bodies with vanishing inertia
and have not discarded any of the physical associ-
ations of Newton’s theory.

Of course, in extending Newton’s formalism to
material bodies with vanishing inertia, we also use
the fact that we “observe” material bodies using
the electromagnetic radiation, Light, as a material
body of vanishing inertia.

Clearly, any modiﬁcations can then occur for
only those newtonian concepts which rely on the
(implicit) assumption that signals can, in princi-

14

ple, propagate with inﬁnite speed. Evidently, si-
multaneity of events and the absolute nature of
time are two such conceptions.

Now, when we carry out the required physical
associations, it follows that the null trajectory of
the Minkowski spacetime is the path followed by
Light (as a material body with vanishing inertia), a
timelike trajectory is the path followed by a mate-
rial body moving with speed less than the speed of
Light, while the spacelike trajectory would be fol-
lowed by a (hypothetical) material body moving
with speed faster than the speed of Light relative
to inertial observers.

But, it should be evident that the association of
the inertia of a material body with the points of
the Minkowski spacetime does not then produce
any change in the Minkowski 4-space. Then, the
Minkowski spacetime is an inert background for
the material bodies. Clearly, even the special the-
ory of relativity explains all phenomena as rela-
tions between objects existing in space and time.
But, as shown by Minkowski, space and time in
special relativity are now mathematically treatable
as a 4-dimensional spacetime.

Now, the construction of the coordinate axes and
clocks must be using the material bodies. But, this
construction is left outside the scope also of the
special theory of relativity. Hence, the construc-
tion of the coordinate system in special relativity
is using rigid rods and clocks which never get af-
fected by anything happening with other material
bodies. This is surely an important drawback of
the special theory of relativity just exactly as it
was of Newton’s theory.

The Minkowski spacetime is then an absolute,
unchanging, 4-space in physical considerations of
the special theory of relativity.

Hence, the acceleration of a material point is, at
a fundamental level, then to be referred to only the
4-dimensional background Minkowski spacetime or
the corresponding unchanging coordinate system.
Such coordinate systems, the inertial frames of ref-
erence, are then fundamental or special to this de-
scription of physical systems.

Consequently, even in the special theory of rel-
ativity, if we select any coordinate frame which is
accelerated with respect to the background coor-
dinate system, we will have to introduce ﬁctitious
forces, the pseudo-forces, to account for various
physical phenomena.

The unambiguous physical construction of the
inertial frames of reference is then a problem even
in special theory of relativity.

Moreover, it should also be clear now that, when
v > c, the special theory of relativity oﬀers no
laws for the motion of a material body. Clearly,
Lorentz transformations have no (obvious) mean-

ing for v > c. This must be recognized as a lim-
itation of the special theory of relativity if such
material bodies with speeds larger than the speed
of Light existed in reality. (Several physicists have
speculated [5] about the properties of (hypotheti-
cal) super-luminal material body, Tachyon, parti-
cle so named by G Feinberg.)

Notice now that even the special theory of rela-
tivity is based on two independent considerations:
ﬁrst, those of the Law of Motion and second, those
of the Law of Force. The Law of Motion is then
empty of content without a Law of Force even in
special theory of relativity. That is to say, unless
and until we specify the “force” acting on a mate-
rial point, the Special Relativistic Law of Motion
will not be able to provide us the path followed
by that material point. But, this force is, likewise
in Newton’s theory, an action at a distance due to
source property of material bodies.

Then, whatsoever is the Law of Force, it must
be recognized as an assumption. Any such law is a
statement that we postulate regarding the “force”
acting between material points. This means that,
essentially, we could then always raise the ques-
tion: Why not any other form for the force acting
between material points? Clearly, as long as the
law of motion is independent of the law of force,
this state of aﬀairs persists.

As an example, consider Coulomb’s law from
electrostatics. If Q and q are to denote the quan-
tities of electric charge possessed by two mate-
rial bodies separated by distance d then, the elec-
trostatic force between them is given by the well
known expression:

~Fe = k

q Q
d2

ˆd

where k is a constant and ˆd is a unit vector along
the line joining the two charges. This force is at-
tractive or repulsive depending on the relative sign
of the two electric charges.

It must be recognized that this law is also an
assumption. Furthermore, the quantity of charge
is the source property of material body by which
one charged body produces the force on another
charged body by acting on it at a distance. Then,
we could always raise the above question: Why not
any other form for this force?

Then, Newton’s Law of Gravitation is also an
assumption vis-´a-vis the special theory of relativ-
ity. But, by imagining an inertial frame in which
two separated material bodies are at rest (so that
the magnitude of the gravitational force between
them is given by Newton’s law), by imagining an-
other inertial frame moving with uniform velocity
v relative to the ﬁrst one and by the equality of

15

the inertial and the gravitational mass, it is easy
to see that Newton’s law of gravitation is not a
Lorentz-invariant statement.

Evidently, special theory of relativity requires,
therefore, an appropriate modiﬁcation of Newton’s
Law of Gravitation so that the Law of Gravitation
be compatible with the postulate of (special) rela-
tivity stated earlier.

However, it must be borne in mind that, even
with this modiﬁcation, we will not be able to cir-
cumvent the problem of the Law of Force being an
assumption in special relativity. No matter what
modiﬁcation of Newton’s Law of Gravitation we
may propose, the basic framework would continue
to be unsatisfactory. Therefore, special relativ-
ity oﬀers no explanation whatsoever for the phe-
nomenon of gravitation. This is exactly as was the
case with Newton’s theory.

Since the law of motion (requiring the concept of
the inertia for motion of a material body) is inde-
pendent of the law of force (requiring the concept
of the source attribute for a material body), the
equality of the inertial and the gravitational mass
of a material body is also an explicit assumption
of special relativity. Again, this is exactly as it was
with Newton’s theory.

Then, it immediately follows that the origin of
the source characteristics of material bodies, like
the gravitational mass of a material body, will not
be explainable in special relativity.

Clearly, this is so because special relativity, simi-
lar to Newton’s theory, treats the cause of the mo-
tion of a material body, the force, as an agency
which is essentially independent of the origin of
the inertia of that body.

Surely, the equality of the inertial and the grav-
itational mass of a material body is to be inter-
preted to mean that the same quality of a material
body manifests itself, according to circumstances,
as its inertia or as its weight (heaviness). It should
therefore be evident now that whenever the cause
of motion is treated as being essentially indepen-
dent of the origin of the inertia of motion of a
material point, we will not be able to explain the
origin for the cause of motion.

Clearly, due only to this reason, the origin of
“force” - the cause of motion - then remains un-
explained in Newton’s theory as well as in special
theory of relativity.

Clearly, conclusions of either Newton’s theory
or of the special theory relativity based on the law
of gravitation, eg, regarding the ﬁnal or the end-
state of the collapse of physical objects such as a
star, cannot be “reliable” in their entirety since any
“Law of Gravitation” is an assumption of either of
these two theories. It is important that this issue
be adequately recognized.

Still, it is true that certain experimental justi-
ﬁcation exists for the laws of force (for example,
Newton’s law of gravitation, Coulomb’s law etc.)
“assumed” by Newton’s theory. This is in the form
of the veriﬁcation of predicted planetary motions,
explanation of the tides, results of many day-to-
day laboratory experiments etc.

Similarly, an experimental justiﬁcation also ex-
ists for special relativity in the form of the ver-
iﬁcation of time dilation eﬀects, for example, for
elementary particles moving close to the speed of
Light. It also “explains” results [1, 5] of Michelson-
Morley and other experiments.

Consequently, we can “trust” the predictions of
these theories to certain extent. Up to what pre-
cise extent can we trust the predictions of these
theories? Evidently, this question can be com-
pletely answered only on the basis of the theory
that explains the origin of inertia. It should also
be clear that “correct” answer to the question of
the end-state of gravitational collapse of a star, for
example, can only be obtained from a theory that
explains the origin of inertia.

However, we may also “verify” the predictions
of these theories by laboratory experimentations
and astronomical observations. It is such “veriﬁ-
cations” of the “assumed” law of gravitation that
are, most often, responsible for our falling in the
trap of assuming that the law of gravitation “has
the experimental proof” and, therefore, that this
law is unchangeable.

Nothing can be really far from the truth than
this! A critical analysis of fundamental concepts
helps us avoid such misunderstandings by showing
us the limitations of such concepts.

Another extremely important aspect is that of
the quantum considerations. These considerations
acknowledge a fundamental limitation in the (clas-
sical) ideas by essentially recognizing that in mak-
ing a measurement of a physical quantity, an ob-
server will
inevitably cause an “uncontrollable”
change to the system being observed. This aspect
is particularly important for phenomena involving
microscopic bodies.

As an example, consider the measurement of the
location of an object. From our ordinary day-to-
day experiences, we know that to locate an object,
we must send a signal, a ray of Light, in the di-
rection of that object and must receive the signal
reﬂected from that object.

But, a ray of Light imparts momentum to the
object in the process of reﬂection, thereby chang-
ing the earlier (measured) value of the (linear) mo-
mentum of that object. Consequently, there is al-
ways to be an interaction of the object and the
observing agency in the process of any measure-
ment of the physical quantity.

16

Now, the issue is whether we can “control” this
“change” in any conceivable manner to whatsoever
extent that we desire.

If we could then, we would always be able to si-
multaneously measure, both, the location and the
momentum of the object to any desired accuracy.
If, fundamentally speaking, we cannot then, new-
tonian and special relativistic concepts require, ob-
viously, modiﬁcations.

This is of course not the issue of simply being un-
able to achieve the above task in a particular ex-
perimental setup due to experimental limitations
of the equipments of measurement. Rather, this is
the issue of the theoretical possibility or the impos-
sibility of the measurement of a physical quantity
to any desired accuracy.

Here, it is vital to recognize that this issue is
related to the issue of the physical construction of
the coordinate system, ﬁrst raised by Descartes [1]
during the Golden Era of Science.

In the experiment of the measurement of the lo-
cation of an object, Light, as a material body, acts
as a (tiny) road-roller trying to cross the location
of the given object, say, as a part of the coordi-
nate axis. This road-roller must have some action
on the object, then. This was the issue raised by
Descartes [1]. Then, the earlier issue is whether
this action of the road-roller is “controllable” by
the experimenter so that the location can be mea-
sured to any desired accuracy.

Now, it is the tacit assumption of Newton’s the-
ory as well as of Einstein’s special theory of rela-
tivity that this aforementioned action is “precisely
controllable” in the experimental setup. That is
why the location of a material point is precisely
determinable simultaneously with its (linear) mo-
mentum in these theories.

But, is it really so? To be sure, we must inves-
tigate this issue further. This was what was done
by Heisenberg [7] at the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury - another Golden Era of Science. Apart from
those of Galileo, Newton, Descartes and Einstein,
Heisenberg’s investigation of this issue is another
example of the critical analysis of related funda-
mental concepts.

Then, from Heisenberg’s analysis, it follows [7]
that simultaneously measured values of the loca-
tion and the momentum of that object satisfy
(Heisenberg’s) indeterminacy relation - the basis
of the theory of the quantum.

Heisenberg’s indeterminacy relation shows that
the location and the (linear) momentum of a mate-
rial body, represented as a material point, cannot
be simultaneously determined to any better accu-
racy than is permitted by this relation. Surely, this
indicates limitations of the concepts of Newton’s
theory and those of the special relativity.

In spite of this above being the case, special rela-
tivity is surely an advance or a step in the direction
of a theory that can “explain” the origin of inertia
and, hence, gravitation.

In this connection, it must be borne in mind
that the inertia, the opposition of a material body
to a change in its state of motion, can be expected
to depend on the state of motion, speed, of that
body. This expectation is based on the analogous
situation of the opposition to motion experienced
by a person located in a crowd. This opposition to
motion of a person depends on the state of motion,
speed, of that person.

That the expectation based on the above anal-
ogy holds is then expressed by the “variation of
(inertial) mass with velocity” in special relativity
as we have seen earlier in (6).

In a sense, it is only this single result that is con-
ceptually the most important one of the achieve-
ments of special relativity. It is of course not that
other results such as the “relativization of time”
are any less important than this.

But, only the mass-variation with velocity indi-
cates that special relativity is a (right) step in the
direction of a theory that could explain the origin
of inertia. Indeed, Einstein was fond of referring
to special relativity as a step [5].

The origin of inertia of material bodies may then
be “explainable” by developing the aforementioned
analogy (to a person placed in a crowd) into a suit-
able new theoretical framework.

Now, concepts of Euclidean geometry will, evi-
dently, not be useful to this new theoretical frame-
work because the physical construction of its co-
ordinate system (coordinate axes, measuring rods
and clocks) is required to be unchangeable irre-
spective of the motion of material bodies in this
geometry. This is, as we have now recognized, ev-
idently, unsatisfactory.

Then, we must use that geometry whose (physi-
cal) construction of space coordinates changes with
the motions of material bodies. Then, as a judi-
cious guess based on our related considerations, it
therefore follows that we need to use, for the new
theory, geometric considerations more general than
those of the Euclidean geometry.

What kind of non-Euclidean geometry is this

new one required to be?

Here, we must ﬁrst realize that a “material
body” and “geometry of space” aught to be in-
distinguishable. Moving a material body from its
given “location” should cause changes to the con-
struction of the coordinate system. And, that will
change the “geometry” because the construction of
the coordinate system is the basis of the “metric
function” of the geometry.

17

Hence, this new geometry is determined by phys-
ical or material bodies.
In turn, material bodies
are also determined by this new geometry in that
“given the (pseudo) metric function of the new ge-
ometry” we would know how the material bodies
are “located” relative to each other.

Evidently, these ideas are then fundamentally
diﬀerent from those of Newton’s theory as well as
from those of special relativity. In these new con-
siderations, the concept of “force” is abandoned
and is replaced by suitable properties of the geom-
etry - its transformations.

Even when the basic conceptions of the new the-
ory are required to be quite diﬀerent, it must be
borne in mind that the successes of Newton’s the-
ory as well as those of special relativity will have to
be obtainable in the new theory. Mathematically,
various formulas of the new theory must “reduce”
to those of special relativity and to those of New-
ton’s theory in approximations.

It is in this above mathematical sense that the
new theory will have to incorporate special relativ-
ity and Newton’s theory, both.

Now, with due respects to Minkowski’s works,
there is nothing fundamentally important about
the 4-dimensional formalism in special relativity.
In other words, all the physical results, obtained
using explicitly the 4-dimensional considerations,
can also be obtained using the 3-space and the
time, essentially separately.

[As a matter of fact, Einstein’s original paper(s)
on the special theory of relativity did not use any of
the 4-dimensional methods which were discovered
by Minkowski only later.]

However, the continuum of the quadruplets of
four coordinates, (x, y, z, t) with all the four co-
ordinates varying in continuous manner, may be
expected to form the basis of the theory of the
future as well. After all, we have abstracted these
four quantities - three for the space and one for the
time - from our ordinary, day-to-day, experiences
with material bodies.

Also, to this day, there are no indications, of
any kind whatsoever, from our ordinary experi-
ences that, to describe the “motions” of material
bodies and, hence, to also describe the origin of
their inertia, we need to add any other quantities
to this list of the four coordinates.

From the critical analysis of related concepts
that we have accomplished above, it has also not
emerged that the extra dimensions are any neces-
sary to this description.

Consequently, even if there existed extra dimen-
sions, these must somehow be “suppressed” so as
to be not observable at the present level of obser-
vations. Why would this always be so? Presently,
we simply do not know why.

Then, with due respects to them, it must be said
that attempts [5] to add extra dimensions, over and
above those of the four of space and time, have not
led to any “genuine advance” in our understanding
of the physical world around us.

In the absence of any clear indications about
the possible extra-dimensions, it is, conservatively
speaking, advisable to restrict ourselves to only the
quadruplets of four coordinates: (x, y, z, t). This is
what we have followed here.

Then, on the basis of the mathematical “beauty”
of Minkowski’s 4-dimensional formulation, we may
be tempted to think that any future theory of the
physical world should be based only on the relevant
4-dimensional considerations.

This last issue is then that of being able to treat
the set of quadruplets as a 4-dimensional “pseudo-
metric” manifold when general transformations of
quadruplets are invoked. But, transformations of
quadruplets need not be continuous, let alone dif-
ferentiable. Then, usefulness of the diﬀerentiable
manifold structure or the pseudo-metric structure
becomes questionable.

What can then substitute the diﬀerentiability
(partial diﬀerential equations) being used here?
This is the issue of the most basic mathematical
formalism to describe physics.

Currently, theories of measures and dynamical

systems appear basic [8].

However, any further considerations of the new
theory are obviously beyond the scope of our
present endeavors.

18

In conclusion, therefore, I hope to have made it
clear to you in this modest presentation as to why
the special theory of relativity is only a step in the
right direction. Then, the concepts used by special
relativity are not to be treated as unchangeable.
In fact, we aught to change some of the concepts
here if we aim at a profounder understanding of
the physical phenomena.

I hope also to have made it clear to you that
to advance further from the conceptions in New-
ton’s theory and in special relativity, we need to
“abandon” the concept of “force” as an external
cause of motion and “replace” it with some other
satisfactory concept.

Einstein had hoped to achieve this with his gen-
eral theory of relativity. However, he had realized
[1, 4, 5, 8] that his dream is not materialized in
the formulation that he had proposed for the gen-
eral relativity. He then searched for a new Uniﬁed
Field Theory without success.

But, towards the end of his life, he had begun
seeing beyond the vision of others, as had always
been the case [5] with him in the past.

[9] For his purely scientiﬁc views, heresies in the eyes
of the Roman Catholic Church, Galileo had to face
the Cardinal Judges of the Inquisition Board of the
Church for this heretic crime.
Galileo was of course not any (religious or other-

wise) fanatic person seeking martyrdom for only
the sake of the beliefs he held, particularly when he
was already of an advanced age. He felt it advisable
to bend before his persecutors.
Galileo then had to recite, kneeling before the Car-
dinal Judges of the Inquisition Board, some formula
of abjuration, this notwithstanding his advanced
age and ill health. For details, see Giorgio de San-
tillana (1955) The Crime of Galileo (The University
of Chicago Press, Chicago).
But, even after this Inquisition and subsequent ab-
juration, Galileo was under permanent house-arrest
for the remaining eight years of his life to also face
total blindness. His scientiﬁc works still found the
way to reach out to the whole of the Europe and,
ultimately, the World.

However, a note was to be found in Galileo’s hand-
writing, surely written before he turned totally
blind, on the margin of his own copy of his famous
book Dialogue on the Great World Systems,
for
which he faced the Inquisition, as: In the matter of
introducing novelties. And who can doubt that it will
lead to the worst disorders when minds created free
by God are compelled to submit slavishly to an out-
side will? When we are told to deny our senses and
subject them to the whim of others? When people
devoid of whatsoever competence are made judges
over experts and are granted authority to treat them
as they please? These are the novelties which are
apt to bring about the ruin of commonwealths and
the subversion of the state.

Abstract

In recent times, Discrete Space Time Architectures are being con-
sidered, in the context of Quantum Gravity, Quantum Super Strings,
Dark Energy and so on. We show that such a scheme is intimately tied
up with a varying G cosmology, which again explains otherwise inex-
plicable observations like the anomalous accelerations of Pioneer space
crafts as also considerations involving the Zero Point Field, Random
Electrodynamics and the derivation of Quantum Mechanical eﬀects
therefrom as also intertial mass.

1 Introduction

Quantum Gravity and Quantum Super String Theory work at a minimum
spacetime interval. This is at the Planck scale, and is a major departure
from earlier theories, be they Classical or Quantum, where a diﬀerenciable
spacetime manifold is considered [1, 2, 3, 4].
According to ’t Hooft [5], space time has to be discrete. Infact, in his words,
“...It is somewhat puzzling... why the lattice structure of space and time
had escaped attention from other investigators...” Similarly the author had,
working independantly on these lines, developed a model that correctly pre-
dicted dark energy and an accelerating expanding universe, all of which was
subsequently conﬁrmed by observation [6, 7, 8, 9].

2 Discrete Space Time Gravitation

We will introduce the minimum cut oﬀ into the Schwarzschild geometry and
show that this is equivalent to a scheme in which the gravitational constant
slowly varies with time.
Our starting point is the Schwarzschild geometry [10]

We can immediately see that (7) is correct if l is a Compton length and τ
the corresponding Compton time and t and r are the age and radius of the
universe (remembering that c = 1). The Planck scale infact is the Compton
scale for a Planck mass. In any case we have with discrete spacetime, the
equation (6).
Time varying G cosmologies have been considered though in slightly diﬀer-
ent contexts (Cf.for example references [13, 14, 8]). Infact apart from several
well known observations, (6) also explains less well known eﬀects like the de-
crease in the orbital period and diameter of binary pulsars or the mysterious
anomalous accelerations of the Pioneer space crafts which have deﬁed any
other explanation so far [15, 16, 17, 18].

3 Binary Pulsars

Cosmologies with a variable G as mentioned above have been considered in
the past [13, 14] and more recently by the author, though in a slightly dif-
ferent context [6, 7, 8]. Essentially in this latter case, there is a background
dark energy which leads to an accelerating ever expanding universe (while
Gravitation manifests itself in the spirit of Sakharov’s theory). This predic-
tion was conﬁrmed observationally in 1998 and dark energy itself was ﬁnally
conﬁrmed in 2003 and declared as the breakthrough of the year [9].
It has been shown that this scheme explains many observational results like
the precesion of the perihelion, the bending of light and so on [15, 19]. We
would now like to point out that other delicate eﬀects like the observed de-
crease in orbital parameters of a binary pulsar, an anomalous acceleration for

3

the planets, and an as yet unexplained anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer
space crafts can also be explained within this scheme.
Our starting point is the equation

where T is the age of the universe. It may be noted that this is in agreement
with observational limits [20, 11].
Let us now consider an object revolving about another object, as in the case
of the binary pulsar [22]. The gravitational energy of the system is given by,

For variable G we have, after the elapse of time t,

≡
We take ˙µ to be a constant, in view of the fact that G varies very sowly, as
can be seen from (8).

in the case of binary pulsars [21, 23]. Let us consider the binary pulsar PSR

It may be mentioned that this same eﬀect has been interpreted as being
due to gravitational radiation, even though there are some objections to the
calculation in this case (Cf.ref.[23]).

4 Anomalous Accelerations

We next consider observed but inexplicable anomalous accelerations in the
Solar System. Our starting point is the well known equation for orbits

and all their attempts to explain this anomalous acceleration have failed [18].
Similarly in the case of the earth (and other planets) we can deduce an
10−9cms/sec2 which is known to be
anomalous inward radial acceleration
the case [24].

5 Dark Energy Considerations

We note that as is well known, such a background ZPF can explain the
Quantum Mechanical spin half as also the anomalous g = 2 factor for an
otherwise purely classical electron [25, 26]. The key point here is (Cf.ref.[25])
that the classical angular momentum ~r
m~v does not satisfy the Quantum
Mechanical commutation rule for the angular momentum ~J . However when
we introduce the background Zero Point Field, the momentum now becomes

×

~J = ~r

m~v + (e/2c)~r

( ~B

~r) + (e/c)~r

~A0,

(26)

×

×

×
where ~A0 is the vector potential associated with the ZPF and ~B is an ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld introduced merely for convenience, and which can be
made vanishingly small.
It can be shown that ~J in (26) satisﬁes the Quantum Mechanical commuta-
tion relation for ~J

~J. At the same time we can deduce from (26)

×

×

Relation (27) gives the correct Quantum Mechanical results referred to above.
From (26) we can also deduce that

(28) shows that the mean dimension of the region in which the ﬂuctuation
contributes is of the order of the Compton wavelength of the electron.
As a further conﬁrmation, we can similarly deduce that there is a mean time
interval of the order of the electrons’ Compton time. For this we note that
the energy of the ZPF is given by [26]

If now we denote the impulsive change of momentum in the interval τ due
to the buﬀetting of the particle by the ZPF by

(31)

then we can easily deduce that by (29) and (30),

In (32) v is the root mean square velocity of the rapidly vibrating particle,
which we take to be c, the velocity of light. Then we can deduce from (31), on
using the fact that the magnitude of the impulsive change of the momentum
would be mc, that

¯h
mc2

τ

∼

(33) shows that τ is of the order of the Compton time as is to be expected
from (28).
We can interpret the above in the following manner. Let us in (32) take the
velocity v to be the velocity of light. This automatically means that the mass
m is vanishingly small. Then as a result of the ZPF we can deduce from (28),
(30), (31), (32) and (33) that the energy of the particle is r∆
τ which is mc2.
In other words the otherwise massless particles acquires its inertial mass m
as a result of the ZPF at the Compton scale. Indeed this has been shown
earlier also [6]. Interestingly, in the context of (32) and the ZPF, it can be
easily shown that the thermal wavelength, in the limit v
c becomes the
Compton wavelength (Cf.[6]). We can see all this brieﬂy as follows:
Starting with the energy of the ZPF

→

where λ is the Compton wavelength, we can see that the energy in a volume

λ3 is given by mc2.

From a diﬀerent perspective, the ﬂuctuation in curvature R over the length
λ is given by

∆R

where L is the Planck length. It follows that at the Compton scale of ele-
mentary particles

From yet another perspective, if we consider a massless particle undergoing
rapid motion in a small volume V , the thermal wavelength is given by

∆R

N ∼

λthermal ≈

¯h
√m2c2 =

,

that is the entire mass of the particle can be recovered from the rapid Zit-
terbewegung type motions at the Compton scale, as we saw above.
There is another way to see this. In the Santamato deBroglie-Bohm approach
it turns out that there is a scalar curvature R in terms of which the Quantum
potential Q is given by [27, 28]

In earlier work [8], the Quantum potential Q has been shown to equal the
energy mc2, at the Compton scale. So we have, at this scale from (34)

This shows that the curvature is that of a sphere of dimension of the Compton
wavelength. In other words the ZPF curls up or condenses the Compton scale
to form an elementary particle.
We now observe from (26) that, given the ZPF, in the above context, we
have

This well known minimum coupling result appears in the Weyl formulation of
guage invariant geometry and has been shown to be equivalent to an underly-
ing non commutative geometry arising due to minimum space time intervals
which again has been shown to be symptomatic of the double connectivity of
the Dirac bispinor wave equation [28, 15]. The minimum space time cut oﬀ
at the Compton scale too has been shown to follow in the above formulation
(28) and (33). Thus, the geometry of fermions with the above characteristics
is symptomatic of the ZPF at the Compton scale.
Finally, it may be seen that the minimum space time interval considerations

9

which lead to (6), can equally well be thought of, equivalently, to √N par-
ticles (pions) being created in the Compton time fuzzy interval thus adding
to the mass of the universe by the amount M/√N . This is because as can
be seen, from equation (7),

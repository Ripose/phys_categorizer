Using ordinary multiplication to do relativistic velocity addition

Alma Teao Wilson

Relativistic addition of velocities in one dimension, though a mainstay of introductory physics,
contributes much less physical insight than it could. For such calculations, we propose the use
of velocity factors (two-way doppler factors). Velocities can easily, often by inspection, be turned
into velocity factors, and vice versa. Velocity factors compose by ordinary multiplication. This
simple device considerably extends the kinds of questions that can be asked and answered in an
introductory course.

It is also a pedagogical advantage, as we shall see, that
when Vab and Vbc are rational numbers, so is their rela-
tivitic sum Vac.

INTRODUCTION

III. A TRULY ADDITIVE REPRESENTATION :
RAPIDITIES

Relativistic velocity addition in one dimension is a ﬁx-
ture of introductory relativity. It is usually treated as a
pedagogical cul-de-sac: presented, examined, forgotten.
By a very simple transformation, often by inspection,
velocities can be converted into velocity factors, to be
deﬁned below. Relativistic addition of velocities cor-
responds to ordinary multiplication of velocity factors.
Using the standard formula, addition of more than two
relativistic velocities quickly becomes unwieldy. Using
velocity factors, such problems can often be solved by
inspection. Moreover many problems beyond the prac-
tical reach of the usual formula are so easily formulated
using velocity factors that they, too, can be solved by
inspection.

Physically, the velocity factor is just a two-way doppler
factor. They are therefore closely related to the k (a one-
way doppler factor) in Bondi’s k-calculus1,2 and also to
rapidity (the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the velocity, or
logarithm of k), but they are superior to either approach
for deriving closed form answers by inspection. Moreover,
one can prove their properties from the usual velocity
addition formula using only elementary algebra.

II. RELATIVISTIC VELOCITY ADDITION

The one-dimensional relativistic velocity addition for-

mula is

Vac = Vab ⊞ Vbc =

Vab + Vbc
1 + Vab · Vbc

,

(1)

where we have taken c = 1 and where we use “⊞” here
and subsequently to denote relativistic velocity addition.
A considerable advantage of this representation of the
composition of velocities is that it is clear how, for ve-
locities small relative to c, relativistic velocity addition
reduces to simple addition. We see at once that veloc-
ity addition is commutative. Its associativity, however,
is not obvious in this representation.

Another representation is that in terms of rapidities or

velocity parameters, given by3

α = b arctanh(

),

(2)

V
c

where b is a constant. Here, it is convenient to take b
as unity, but other choices can also be useful45. We also
continue to take c = 1.

A velocity between −1 and 1 becomes a rapidity be-
tween −∞ and ∞. This representation is monotonic in-
creasing and invertible. The rapidity is zero when the
velocity is.
Since

tanh(αab + αbc) =

tanh(αab) + tanh(αbc)
1 + tanh(αab) · tanh(αbc)

,

(3)

the relativistic sum Vac = Vab ⊞ Vbc yields the ordinary

sum αac = αab + αbc.

The rapidity representation is manifestly commutative
and manifestly associative. Again for small velocities,
the rapidity reduces to the velocity giving correspondence
with Galilean velocity addition.

Rapidity is particularly useful for integrating proper
acceleration3. Indeed it can be interpreted as the inte-
gral of the proper acceleration4: in a relativistic rocket,
it is the velocity one would calculate by multiplying the
rocket’s average accelerometer reading by the elapsed
time on the rocket’s clock. This is the velocity that would
be imputed by an ideal Newtonian inertial guidance sys-
tem.

In a companion paper, we show that rapidity can be
interpreted as the change in pitch of radiation fore and
aft of the direction of motion5.

The omission of rapidities from introductory treat-
ments of relativistic velocity addition is puzzling. Hyper-
bolic tangents and their inverses have long been available
on even modest scientiﬁc calculators, so that the result

V1 ⊞ V2 = tanh (arctanh V1 + arctanh V2)

is easy to remember and quick to compute. Nor is it a
serious objection that the calculator gives only an inex-
act numerical result, because in practical situations the
inexactness of computation will be dwarfed by the inex-
actness of the measured values.

Nor can the reason for the omission of rapidities lie in
the underlying theory. Using velocities V = tanh α but
not rapidities α in the analytic geometry of the x-t plane
is strongly analogous to using slope s = tan θ but not
angle θ in the analytic geometry of the x-y plane. One
can treat the usual addition formula for tangents as a
“slope addition formula”

s1 ⊕ s2 =

s1 + s2
1 − s1s2

.

But while one can indeed formulate the analytic geome-
try of the Euclidean plane using slopes and never angles,
it is artiﬁcial to do so. It is similarly artiﬁcial in relativity
to use velocities and never rapidities.

If neither theory nor practice account for this omis-
sion, perhaps a particular kind of pedagogical conve-
nience does. In teaching velocity addition, it is customary
to use examples and problems in which each of the veloc-
ities to be added is a simple fraction of c; their relativistic
sum is then also a fraction of c. In this case, computation
using the usual velocity addition formula uses exact ratio-
nal arithmetic, which makes the examples easier to follow
and the problems easier to grade and to troubleshoot.

As we shall see below, the method of velocity factors
shares this pedagogical virtue, while nonetheless bring-
ing us most of the theoretical and practical virtues of
rapidity.

IV. JUSTIFICATION OF THE METHOD OF
VELOCITY FACTORS

Deﬁne the velocity factor f corresponding to V by

f = g(V ) =

1 + V
1 − V

.

(4)

We note in passing that g is a M¨obius function that
rotates the Riemann sphere by a quarter turn, with ﬁxed
points ±i; since all the coeﬃcients are real, the real axis
maps to itself.
In particular, if one stereographically
projects the the real axis onto a unit circle centred at 0,
then g corresponds to a quarter turn of this circle, taking
-1 to 0, 0 to 1, 1 to ±∞, and ±∞ to -1. Composing g
twice yields the negative reciprocal function, composing
it three times yields its inverse, and composing it four
times yields the identity.

The connection between M¨obius functions and relativ-
ity proves remarkably deep6; this particular transforma-
tion has other computational uses7. We shall not require
these properties, though, to prove what we need.

Solving for V, we get

V =

f − 1
f + 1

.

The correspondence between V and f is monotonic
increasing, with the velocity range [−1, 1] corresponding
to the velocity factor range [0, ∞]. V = 0 corresponds
to f = 1.

Clearly, if ¯V = −V then ¯f = f −1; negation of velocities

corresponds to reciprocation of velocity factors.

Now

fab × fbc =

×

1 + Vbc
1 − Vbc

1 + Vab
1 − Vab
1 + Vab · Vbc + Vab + Vbc
1 + Vab · Vbc − Vab − Vbc

1 + Vab · Vbc + (Vab + Vbc)
1 + Vab · Vbc

(cid:19)
1 + Vab · Vbc − (Vab + Vbc)
1 + Vab · Vbc

(cid:18)
÷

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

1 + (Vab ⊞ Vbc)
1 − (Vab ⊞ Vbc)
1 + Vac
1 − Vac

(6)

So relativistic addition of velocities corresponds to or-

dinary multiplication of velocity factors.

This result might have been had more quickly from the

connection with rapidities,

α = arctanh V
1 + V
1 − V

=

= log(e2) f.

but the derivation in Eq. (6) does not require any ac-
quaintance with either rapidities or hyperbolic functions,
or indeed logarithms, exponentials or calculus.

In our examples, we have also made use of the obser-

vation that if, for any N and D,

then

and that conversely if

V =

f =

D + N
D − N

,

f =

(5)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

then

V =

ν − δ
ν + δ

.

(11)

In particular, if either of V or the corresponding veloc-
ity factor f is rational, or more generally algebraic, then
both are. Converting either way requires taking a sum
and a diﬀerence and forming a ratio; this determines the
target value up to a possible sign change and a possi-
ble reciprocation, both of which can easily be put in by
hand if montonicity and the following correspondences
are remembered :

V f

-1 0
0 1
1 ∞
An alternative mnemonic can be derived from the

trigonometric subtraction formula

tan(ψ − φ) =

tan(ψ) − tan(φ)
1 + tan(ψ). tan(φ)

.

Let ψ − φ = π/4, so that the left hand side is unity. Then
we can solve for tan ψ to get

tan(ψ) =

1 + tan(φ)
1 − tan(φ)

(12)

Comparing this with Eq. (4) we see that if a velocity V
and its corresponding velocity factor f are regarded as
the slopes of two lines, than the line whose slope is f is
rotated by +45◦ relative to the line whose slope is V.

V. USING VELOCITY FACTORS

We now turn to the use of this multiplicative repre-
sentation, in which velocities between −1 and 1 become
velocity factors between 0 and ∞. We shall see that this
representation ﬁts somewhere between the velocity rep-
resentation and the rapidity representation. This corre-
spondence too is a monotonic increasing, invertible func-
tion of velocity, but here zero velocity corresponds to
a velocity factor of 1, and negation of a velocity corre-
sponds to reciprocation of its velocity factor.

Then we compute the corresponding velocity factors :

The values of the velocity factor f are computed by
forming ratios of the sum and the diﬀerence of the nu-
merator and denominator of the values of V.

Whether the sum or the diﬀerence should be in the
numerator and what sign the diﬀerence should carry are
easily ﬁgured out by remembering that the velocity fac-
tor cannot be negative, and that positive velocities V
correspond to velocity factors greater than one. Another
simple mnemonic is derived below.

Next, we multiply the velocity factors we have found

to get the overall velocity factor :

Finally, we form a ratio of the sum and diﬀerence of
the denominator and numerator of the overall velocity
factor on the right to get the velocity sum :
f
3+1
3−1 = 2
5+2
5−2 = 7
4−1
4+1 = 3
× 3

14−5
14+5 = 9
Again, we need not memorize which way around to
write the diﬀerence, or whether to put it in the numerator
or denominator. We need only remember that velocity
factors larger than one correspond to positive velocities,
and that the magnitude of a velocity can be no greater
than one. So, ﬁnally,

where we are taking c = 1.
We make a table containing the velocities we wish to

sum :

What, relativistically, is 3/7 of (5/8)c?
Regarding (5/8)c as the overall result of a large number
of locally equivalent small boosts, this question asks what
the velocity is when 3/7 of these small boosts have been
executed.

From another point of view, the question asks for the
velocity of a boost, which when repeated 7 times (in suc-
cessive comoving frames), gives the same result as boost-
ing 3 times (again, in successive comoving frames) by
(5/8)c. In other words, we want to ﬁnd U such that

U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U =

⊞ 5

⊞ 5

.

(13)

Before resorting to velocity factors, let us try to solve
this by repeated use of the usual velocity addition for-
mula on each side. Then Eq. (13) can be written

U 7 + 21 · U 5 + 35 · U 3 + 7 · U
7 · U 6 + 35 · U 4 + 21 · U 2 + 1

=

1085
1112

,

(14)

or

1112 · U 7 − 7595 · U 6 + 23352 · U 5 − 37975 · U 4

+38920 · U 3 − 22785 · U 2 + 7784 · U − 1085 = 0.

(15)

Even exploiting the palindromic symmetry between the
coeﬃcients in numerator and denominator of the left
hand side of Eq. (14), ﬁnding a solution in closed form is
non-trivial.

Using rapidities and a scientiﬁc calculator, a numerical

answer is easily obtained by evaluating

tanh

≈ 0.3043.

Using velocity factors, we can produce a closed-form an-
swer practically by inspection.

We ﬁrst take 5/8 and ﬁnd its velocity factor, which is

(5+8)/(8-5) = 13/3.

We raise this to the 3/7 power to get 133/7/33/7, the
velocity factor of the desired answer, and convert back to
a velocity in closed form,

U =

133/7 − 33/7
133/7 + 33/7 .

(17)

This result can be conﬁrmed by evaluating the left
hand side of Eq. (16) algebraically, as shown below in
section VIII.

It can also be conﬁrmed from Eq. (13) as shown below
in section IX. Using the velocity addition formula to con-
ﬁrm a correct value already supplied takes considerably
more eﬀort than ﬁnding that value using velocity factors.

given separation speed. Thus if O at rest at x = 0 in a
vacuum sends a light pulse of duration T to an mirror
M travelling with velocity V along the positive x axis,
then then O will observe a reﬂected pulse to have a du-
ration f · T. Moreover, this suggests an obvious physical
explanation of why velocity factors compose by multipli-

as one of the postulates of his k-calculus1, an elegant
and accessible formulation of special relativity. His k, a
one-way doppler factor, is our f 1/2. Of course, any ﬁxed
nonzero power of either of these would also be a faithful
multiplicative representation.

A one-way doppler factor is simpler than a two-
way doppler factor, so Bondi’s k is simpler physically.
Nonetheless, like rapidity, Bondi’s beautiful k−calculus
has not become a part of standard part of the pedagogy
of introductory physics.

VII. SUMMARY

Velocity addition using the usual formula is unwieldy
and of limited usefulness. Rapidities are a more power-
ful, and easily applied to a broader range of questions.
The internal workings of that tool are, like those of the
calculators required to use them, usually left inaccessible.
This leads to diﬃculties in error checking and interpre-
tation.

Velocity factors are more or less the internal workings
of rapidity. The correspondence between velocity factors
and velocities is simple. The use of velocity factors places
interesting questions in easy reach, and so encourages
tinkering; relativistic velocity addition can now become
a more rewarding part of the standard curriculum than
at present. Velocity factors make physical sense, provide
closed form answers, are at least as memorable as the
usual velocity addition formula and doppler formulae to
which they are equivalent—and one can use them without
having to reach for a calculator.

It is in principle straightforward to evaluate the left

hand side of Eq. (13),

U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U

(19)

with

U =

133/7 − 33/7
133/7 + 33/7 .

Evaluating expression (19) gives

U 7 + 21 · U 5 + 35 · U 3 + 7 · U
7 · U 6 + 35 · U 4 + 21 · U 2 + 1

.

Substituting the right hand side of Eq. (20) into this is
tedious, even when one exploits the symmetries in both
expressions.

We can instead reduce the labor by considering the

expression

with arbitrary positive p and q and arbitrary real m

and n.

Expanding the relativistic sum, we get

pm − qm
pm + qm

⊞ pn − qn
pn + qn

1 + ( pm−qm

.

IX. SOLUTION OF RELATIVISTIC FRACTION
OF VELOCITY USING THE USUAL VELOCITY
ADDITION FORMULA

Multiplying numerator and denominator by (pm +
qm)(pn + qn), this becomes

(pm − qm)(pn + qn) + (pn − qn)(pm + qm)
(pm + qm)(pn + qn) + (pm − qm)(pn − qn)

,

(24)

Evaluating the ﬁrst relativistic addition on the right

hand side of Eq. (13) we ﬁnd

which expands to

pm+n + pmqn − pnqm − qm+n + pm+n + pnqm − pmqn − qm+n
pm+n + pmqn + pnqm + qm+n + pm+n − pmqn − pnqm + qm+n

6

(25)

or

and applying Eq. (27) repeatedly, it should be clear that

2pm+n − 2qm+n
2pm+n + 2qm+n .

Thus we have

pm − qm
pm + qm

⊞ pn − qn

pn + qn =

pm+n − qm+n
pm+n + qm+n .

(26)

(27)

U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U =

(29)

p7 − q7
p7 + q7 .

Now setting p = 133/7 and q = 33/7, the left hand side

of Eq. (13) becomes

(This result could have been had at once from

U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U ⊞ U =

in which the two factors on the left and the product on

We now apply this general result (27) to our problem.

which is what Eq. (18) gave us for the right hand side of
Eq. (13), so that they are equal as claimed.

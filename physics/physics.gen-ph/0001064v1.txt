Light experiences dielectric matter as an eﬀective gravitational ﬁeld and matter experiences light
as a form of gravity as well. Light and matter waves see each other as dual space–time metrics, thus
establishing a unique model in ﬁeld theory. Actio et reactio are governed by Abraham’s energy–
momentum tensor and equations of state for quantum dielectrics.

I. INTRODUCTION

A moving dielectric medium appears to light as an ef-
fective gravitational ﬁeld [1–4]. The medium alters the
way in which an electromagnetic ﬁeld perceives space
and time, formulated most concisely in Gordon’s eﬀec-
tive space–time metric [1]

gF

αβ = gαβ +(cid:18) 1

εµ − 1(cid:19) uαuβ .

(1)

We allow for a back–ground metric gαβ, mostly to have
the convenience of choosing arbitrary coordinates, but
also for the possible inclusion of a genuine gravitational
ﬁeld. Gordon’s metric (1) depends on the dielectric
properties of the medium, on the permittivity ε and on
the magnetic permeability µ, as well as on the four–
dimensional ﬂow uα of the medium (the local four–
velocity). The product εµ is the square of the refractive
index and the prefactor 1 − (εµ)−1 is known as Fresnel’s
dragging coeﬃcient [5–7] (in Fresnel’s days the part of
the ether that the moving medium is able to drag [6]).
In the limit of geometrical optics [8], light rays are zero–
geodesic lines with respect to Gordon’s metric [1–4]. In
the special case of a medium at rest, this result is equiv-
alent to Fermat’s principle [8] and to the formulation of
geometrical optics as a non–Euclidean geometry in space
[9].

Light sees dielectric matter as an eﬀective space–time
metric. How does matter see light?
In atom optics
[10], the traditional role of light and matter is reversed:
Atomic de–Broglie waves are subject to atom–optical in-
struments made of light. Light acts on matter waves in a
similar way as matter acts on light. This paper indicates
that an atomic matter wave experiences an electromag-
netic ﬁeld as the eﬀective metric

Here LF is the Lagrangian of the free electromagnetic
ﬁeld, deﬁned in Eq. (8), and T F
αβ is the free–ﬁeld energy–
momentum tensor (10). As usual, c denotes the speed of

light in vacuum and m is the mass of a single dielectric
atom. In the deﬁnition (3), ρ can be regarded as the prob-
ability density of the atomic de–Broglie wave, for most
(Strictly speaking, mc2ρ describes
practical purposes.
the total enthalpy density of the matter wave, includ-
ing the rest energy as the lion’s share.) Throughout this
paper we employ SI units and use the Landau–Lifshitz
convention [11] of general relativity (with the exception
of using greek space–time and latin space indices). To de-
rive the result (2) with the dielectric parameters (3) we
postulate that the interaction between light and matter
takes on the general form of a metric. Then we demon-
strate the consistency of this idea with previous knowl-
edge, and in particular with Gordon’s metric (1).

The metric (2) indicates that the energy–momentum of
light curves directly the space–time of a dielectric matter
wave. Under normal circumstances the deviation from
the back–ground geometry is very small, see Eqs. (2)
and (3), because the ratio between the electromagnetic
energy and the atomic rest energy mc2 is typically an
extremely small number. In the Newtonian limit of gen-
eral relativity [11], the gravitational correction to a ﬂat
Minkowski space–time is tiny as well, because the cor-
rection is proportional to the ratio between the potential
energy and mc2 of a test particle. For weak gravitational
ﬁelds and low test–particle velocities, general relativity
is an equivalent formulation of Newtonian physics that
agrees in all predicted eﬀects and yet establishes a rad-
ically diﬀerent physical interpretation. Similarly, given
the current state of the art in atom optics, the idea that
light curves the space–time for matter waves is an equiv-
alent formulation of the known light forces, i.e. of the
dipole force and of the recently investigated R¨ontgen in-
teraction [12]. However, one can conceive of signiﬁcantly
enhancing the dielectric properties of matter waves [4]
using similar methods as in the spectacular demonstra-
tions of slow light [13]. Loosely speaking, a large eﬀective
dielectric constant ε could counteract the rest energy mc2
in the relations (3). In this way one could use light to
build atom–optical analogues of astronomical objects on
Earth, for example a black hole made of light.

A. Field tensors

or, in local–galilean coordinates,

Let us ﬁrst agree on the deﬁnitions of the principal
electromagnetic quantities in SI units in general relativ-
ity. We employ the space–time coordinates xµ = (ct, x).
The electromagnetic four–potential is

Aν = (U,−cA) .

(4)

The electromagnetic ﬁeld–strength tensor is constructed
as

Fµν ≡ DµAν − DνAµ = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ

(5)

using the covariant derivatives Dµ with respect to the
back–ground metric gµν. As is well known [11], in the
deﬁnition (5) of Fµν on a possibly curved space–time,
we have been able to replace the Dµ by ordinary partial
derivatives ∂µ ≡ ∂/∂xµ. The ﬁeld–strength tensor reads
in local–galilean coordinates (in a local Minkowski frame)

Here I denotes the intensity, S is the Poynting vector,
and σ is Maxwell’s stress tensor. The symbols ∧ and ⊗
denote the three–dimensional vector and tensor product,
respectively.

We can only form second–rank tensors from Fαβ F α′β ′
by some contraction. Consequently, the linear combi-
nations of the two elementary tensors LF gµν and T F
µν
form the complete class of second–rank tensors that are
quadratic in the ﬁeld strengths Fµν .

B. Quadratic ﬁeld tensors

In dielectric media, induced atomic dipoles constitute
an interaction between light and matter that is quadratic
in the electromagnetic ﬁeld–strength tensor [14]. Let us
therefore list a set of linearly independent second–rank
tensors that are quadratic in Fµν . The most elemen-
tary one is the product of the metric tensor gµν with the
scalar Lagrangian LF of the free electromagnetic ﬁeld
[11]. This Lagrangian is

A. Postulates

Consider a classical atom in an electromagnetic ﬁeld.
The atom is point–like, has a mass m, and can sustain in-
duced electric and magnetic dipoles. In the restframe of
the atom the dipoles respond to the square of the electric
ﬁeld strength, E2, and to the magnetic B2, respectively.
How does a dielectric atom experience the electromag-
netic ﬁeld when the atom is moving?

Let us postulate that the atom sees the ﬁeld as an eﬀec-
tive metric. Consequently, according to general relativity
[11], the action S0 of the atom is

S0 = −mcZ ds

,

ds2 = gA

µνdxµdxν .

(13)

Let us further postulate that the metric of the atom, gA
µν,
is quadratic in the electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths. Any
metric is a second–rank tensor. Hence, we obtain from
Sec. IIB the general form (2) mentioned in the Introduc-
tion.

magnetic energy–momentum tensor [11]

C. Non–relativistic limit

So far, we have not seen how the metric theory (2) and
(13) is related to the model of a moving induced dipole.
Let us consider the non–relativistic limit of velocities low
compared with the speed of light. This limit corresponds
to a motion in an inertial frame close to a restframe co–
moving with the atom. We also regard the electromag-
netic ﬁeld energy to be weak compared with the atomic
rest energy mc2. We neglect any genuine gravitational
ﬁeld, and obtain in cartesian coordinates

ds = q(1 − a LF ) (c2dt2 − dx2) − b T F

(20)

The Lagrangian L0 describes indeed a non–relativistic
atom with electric and magnetic polarizibility αE and
αB, respectively. In this way we have veriﬁed that the
metric theory (2) and (13) agrees with the physical pic-
ture of traveling dipoles and, simultaneously, we have
been able to express the coeﬃcients a and b of the metric
(2) in terms of atomic quantities.

IV. MATTER WAVES

A. Postulate

Gordon has shown [1] that an electromagnetic ﬁeld
experiences dielectric matter as the eﬀective metric (1).
Here we postulate that also the opposite is true: A di-
electric matter wave sees the electromagnetic ﬁeld as a
metric, and in particular as the metric (2) that we have
motivated for traveling dipoles in Sec. III. We demon-
strate the consistency of this idea with Gordon’s theory
in Sec. V. Let us model the matter wave as, ﬁttingly, a
complex Klein–Gordon scalar ψ in an eﬀectively curved
space–time. The action SA of the atom wave ψ is

SA = Z LA√−g d4x

Equation (24) together with the functions (14) and (16)
and the parameters (20) describes how atomic matter
waves respond to electromagnetic ﬁelds.

B. R¨ontgen limit

Let us prove explicitly that the Klein–Gordon La-
grangian (22) contains the known light forces in the limit
of relatively low velocities (compared with c) and of weak
ﬁelds (compared with mc2). We separate from the atomic
wave function ψ the notorious rapid oscillations due to
the rest energy mc2 by deﬁning

This result agrees with the R¨ontgen Lagrangian of Ref.
[16] in the limit of weak ﬁelds and, consequently, de-
scribes indeed the known non–resonant light forces in-
cluding the R¨ontgen interaction [12].

C. Dielectric ﬂow

Accelerated by light forces, an atomic matter wave will
form a probability current that appears as a dielectric
ﬂow. Let us calculate the ﬂow from the phase S of the
wave function,

We introduce

ψ = |ψ| eiS .

wµ ≡ −

¯h
mc

gµν
A ∂νS ,

(27)

(28)

and obtain from the Klein–Gordon equation (24) the con-
servation law of the four–dimensional probability current,

DA

µ (cid:0)|ψ|2wµ(cid:1) =

1

√−gA

∂µ(cid:0)√−gA |ψ|2wµ(cid:1) = 0 .

(29)

In the absence of electromagnetic forces, wµ describes the
local four–velocity of a free matter wave. In the presence
of a ﬁeld, we introduce the dielectric ﬂow uµ by normal-
izing wµ to unity with respect to the back–ground metric
gµν,

uµ ≡

wµ
w

, w ≡ pgµν wµwν .

We deﬁne two densities, ̺ and ρ, as

̺ ≡ |ψ|2wr gA

g

,

ρ ≡ ̺ w .

(30)

(31)

4

We obtain from the conservation law (29)

1

√−g

∂µ(cid:0)√−g ̺ uµ(cid:1) = Dµ (̺ uµ) = 0 .

(32)

Consequently, ̺ is the scalar probability density of the
atomic de–Broglie wave. For most practical purposes the
two densities ̺ and ρ are identical, because w is unity
to a very good approximation. The diﬀerence between
̺ and ρ is subtle: In Sec. VE we show that mc2ρ is the
total enthalpy density of the dielectric matter wave, with
the rest–energy density mc2̺ as the lion’s share.

D. Hydrodynamic limit

As has been mentioned, the objective of this paper is
the proof that the metric interaction (2) between matter
waves and light is compatible with the known theory of
dielectrics [1,14]. When a matter wave or, more likely, a
macroscopic condensate of identical matter waves reaches
the status of a dielectric it behaves like a quantum ﬂuid.
In this macroscopic limit the de–Broglie density varies
over signiﬁcantly larger ranges than the de–Broglie wave
length (the same applies to frequencies), and a hydro-
dynamic approach has become extremely successful [17].
Let us approximate

i¯h ∂ν ψ ≈ −ψ ¯h∂νS .

(33)

We obtain from the Klein–Gordon Lagrangian (22) the
hydrodynamic approximation

LA = r gA

g |ψ|2(cid:20) ¯h2

2m

gµν
A (∂µS)(∂ν S) −

mc2

2 (cid:21) .

(34)

Let us consider the Euler–Lagrange equations derived
from the hydrodynamic Lagrangian (34). We obtain
from the ∂µS dependence of LA the dielectric ﬂow (32)
and from a variation with respect to |ψ|2 the dielectric
Hamilton–Jacobi equation

gµν
A (∂µS)(∂νS) =

m2c2
¯h2

,

or, in terms of the four–vector wµ of Eq. (28),

gA
µν wµwν = 1 .

(35)

(36)

In the hydrodynamic limit the wµ vector represents a
four–velocity that is normalized with respect to the ef-
fective metric (2). We also see that the hydrodynamic
Lagrangian (34) vanishes at the actual minimum that
corresponds to the physical behavior of a dielectric mat-
ter wave.

V. QUANTUM DIELECTRICS

with

A. Actio et reactio

δF L = δF LEFF .

(42)

In the previous section we considered a dielectric mat-
ter wave in a given electromagnetic ﬁeld. Gordon [1]
studied the opposite extreme — an electromagnetic ﬁeld
in a given dielectric medium. Let us address here an
intermediate regime of actio et reactio where light acts
on matter as well as matter acts on light. Such a phys-
ical regime, characterizing a quantum dielectric, occurs
for example when a Bose–Einstein condensate of an al-
kali vapor [17] interacts non–resonantly with light [18].
If we were able to arrive at Gordon’s metric (1) from
our starting point (2) we were inclined to take this as
evidence that our approach is right.

To include the dynamics of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
we add the free–ﬁeld Lagrangian LF to the atomic LA
in hydrodynamic approximation (34),

Note that the two ﬁeld variations in the relation (42)
diﬀer in a subtle way: On the left–hand side, δF abbre-
viates the total variation with respect to the electromag-
netic ﬁeld, whereas on the right–hand side of Eq. (42) we
treat ε, µ, and uα as being ﬁxed, despite their hidden
dependence on the ﬁeld due to the relations (28-31).

We show explicitly in Sec. VD that LEFF is indeed the
desired Lagrangian of light in a dielectric medium. Here
we note that LEFF may metamorphose into a multitude
of forms. For example, we introduce the permittivity ε
and the magnetic permeability µ in terms of elementary
atomic quantities and in accordance with the parameters
(3) mentioned in the Introduction

ε = 1 +

αE

µ

(43)

L = LF + LA ,

(37)

In this way we obtain directly from Eqs. (2) and (3)

and regard the electromagnetic ﬁeld as a dynamic ob-
ject that is subject to the principle of least action. We
could also easily include other interactions by additional
terms in LA such as the atomic collisions within a Bose–
Einstein condensate [17] by a Gross–Pitaevskii term. Let
us consider the ﬁeld variation

due to the deﬁnition (10) of the free–ﬁeld energy–

As has been mentioned in Sec. IVD, the atomic La-
grangian LA vanishes at the minimum of the action, in
the hydrodynamic limit. We utilize that

(39)

and obtain, using Eqs. (28-31),

δF L = δF LF −

(40)

The variation of the Lagrangian with respect to the ﬁeld
determines via the Euler–Lagrange equations the ﬁeld
dynamics. Can we cast δF L in the role of a dielectric?

B. Eﬀective Lagrangian

The principal mathematical artiﬁce of this paper is
an eﬀective Lagrangian that is designed to agree with
L under ﬁeld variations, and that describes a dielectric
medium,

with

due to the symmetry of the back–ground metric gαβ and
the anti–symmetry of the ﬁeld–strength tensor Fαβ .

grangian in the form [1]

The eﬀective Lagrangian appears as the free electromag-

is the inverse of gF

A short exercise proves that gαβ

F
i.e., as the notation suggests it, the contravariant metric
tensor with respect to the covariant gF
αβ. Consequently,
we have indeed arrived at Gordon’s space–time geometry
of light in moving media, starting from our metric (2),
which supports the validity of our postulates.

Note that Gordon’s space–time geometry is not com-
pletely perfect [1]. The metrics (1) and (49) depend only
on the square of the refractive index, εµ, whereas a di-
electric medium is characterized by two dielectric con-
stants ε and µ, in general. What is the imperfection
in the Lagrangian (47)? In order to describe a density
in general relativity, and in particular a Lagrangian den-
sity, we must consider the determinant of the metric that
describes the scaling of space and time. Gordon [1] calcu-
lated the determinant by employing co–moving medium
coordinates, with the result

gF ≡ det(cid:0)gF

αβ(cid:1) =

g
εµ

.

Hence we obtain the eﬀective action

(50)

(51)

(52)

when ε/µ varies signiﬁcantly. However, when the density
proﬁle of the quantum liquid varies smoothly compared
with the wave length of light we can neglect the variation
of ε/µ. Ultracold atoms or Bose–Einstein condensates
[17] are usually in this regime that is also compatible
with the hydrodynamic behavior of the quantum liquid.

D. Maxwell’s equations

The ﬁrst group of Maxwell’s equations follows from the
structure (5) of the ﬁeld–strength tensor Fµν . The Euler–
Lagrange equations of the eﬀective Lagrangian (47) yield
the second group [1,14],

DαH αβ = 0

or ∂α(cid:0)√−g H αβ(cid:1) = 0

with the constitutive equations

H αβ =

ǫ0
µ

F (α)(β) .

(53)

(54)

In local–galilean coordinates we can represent H αβ in
terms (7) of the dielectric D and H ﬁelds in SI units.
In this way we ﬁnd yet another physically meaningful
expression for the eﬀective Lagrangian,

6

LEFF = −

FαβH αβ =

(55)

which is indeed the explicit form of the Lagrangian for
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a linear dielectric.

Equation (54) is equivalent [1] to Minkowski’s constitu-
tive equations in a moving medium [14,19]. In the limit of
low velocities we recover the familiar relations D = ε0ε E
and µH = ε0c2B, and, via Eq. (43),

D ≈ (ε0 + αE̺) E , H ≈ (ε0 − αB̺) c2B ,

(56)

assuming a weak ﬁeld when ρ ≈ ̺. Relativistic ﬁrst–
order corrections lead to the constitutive equations de-
rived in Ref. [16] that describe, for example, the R¨ontgen
eﬀect [20] or lead to Fresnel’s light drag [6] measured in
Fizeau’s experiment [7].

In case of a smooth dielectric density we can regard
ε/µ as a constant, and obtain from Maxwell’s equations

∂α(cid:16)√−gF F (α)(β)(cid:17) = 0 or DF

α F (α)(β) = 0 .

(57)

Light experiences the quantum dielectric as the space–
time metric (1), i.e. as an eﬀective gravitational ﬁeld.

E. Energy–momentum tensor

According to Antoci and Mihich [21] Gordon [1] has
already settled the notorious debate about Minkowski’s
[19] versus Abraham’s [22] energy–momentum tensor in
Abraham’s favor. However, in his paper [1], Gordon as-
sumed the dielectric properties of the medium ε, µ, and
uα, as preassigned quantities. Having done so, the de-
rived energy–momentum tensor is valid if and only if the
dielectric quantities are constants, i.e.
in the case of a
uniform medium, because the conservation of energy and
momentum presupposes the homogeneity of space–time,
according to Noether’s theorem.
If one tries to deter-
mine the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in an inhomogeneous medium one must not consider
the dielectric properties as given functions, but rather as
being generated by a physical object, such as the quan-
tum dielectric studied in this paper. In short, one should
take into account actio et reactio, and in particular the
back action of the medium (an eﬀect seen experimentally
[23]). Does Abraham’s tensor have signiﬁcance beyond
uniform media?

Let us determine the energy–momentum tensor via the
royal road of general relativity, as a variation of the La-
grangian with respect to the back–ground metric [11],

T µν = −

δgµν − L gµν .

(58)

A metric variation δg of the Lagrangian gives, in analogy
with Eq. (40) and the considerations in Sec. VB,

δgL = δgLF −

(59)

We recall that LA vanishes in the hydrodynamic limit.
Consequently, we arrive at the total energy–momentum
tensor in the form

T µν = −2

δLEFF
δgµν − LF gµν + mc2ρ uµuν .

We represent this expression as the sum

T µν = T µν

A + T µν

EFF

with the atomic component

T µν
A = mc2ρ uµuν − p gµν ,
p = LF − LEFF =

ﬂuid’s internal energy is the diﬀerence between enthalpy
density and pressure [24]

ǫ = pm2c4̺2 + p2 − 2p .

(67)

We see that the internal energy approaches mc2 +
ε0(αEE2 + αBc2B2) in the limit of a slow ﬂow and a
low dielectric pressure. Atomic dipoles with positive αE
and αB seem to gain internal energy in the presence of
an electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Let us turn to the energy–momentum tensor of the
ﬁeld. The eﬀective Lagrangian LEFF characterizes a
medium with preassigned dielectric functions ε and µ,
i.e. Gordon’s case [1]. Consequently [1], the eﬀective
energy–momentum tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is
Abraham’s [22]

T µν
EFF = T µν

Ab = T µν

with Minkowski’s tensor [19],

corrected by the Ruhstrahl [22]

We are inclined to interpret the tensor (64) as the ef-
fective energy–momentum tensor of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in the presence of a dielectric medium.

The atomic tensor (62) appears as the energy–
momentum of a ﬂuid under the dielectric pressure (63).
In the limit of low ﬂow velocities the pressure approaches
−ε0(αEE2 + αBc2B2)̺/2, according to Eqs. (55) and
(56). In this limit, atomic dipoles with positive αE and
αB are attracted towards increasing ﬁeld intensities. We
also see from the atomic energy–momentum tensor (62)
that a dielectric ﬂuid possesses the total enthalpy density
mc2ρ = mc2w̺, including the relativistic rest energy. In
this way we have found an interpretation for the density
ρ that appears at the prominent place (3). To calculate
the enthalpy, we express the eﬀective Lagrangian (41) in
terms of the norm w. We use the deﬁnition (30) of the
four–velocity uα and the normalization (36) of the wα,
and obtain

p = LF − LEFF =

or, by inversion,

mc2̺

2 (cid:18) 1

w − w(cid:19) ,

mc2ρ = mc2w̺ = pm2c4̺2 + p2 − p .

This equation describes how the enthalpy density de-
pends on the pressure and on the dielectric density. On
the other hand, Eq. (63) quantiﬁes the pressure that de-
pends on the dielectric density and ﬂow, and on the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld as an external quantity. We may in-
terpret the two formulas (63) and (66) as the equations
of state for the quantum dielectric. The density of the

Ων = Fαα′ uα′

uβ (cid:0)H αβuν + H βνuα + H ναuβ(cid:1) .

(70)

In locally co–moving galilean coordinates or in a medium
at rest, the spatial component of the Ruhstrahl is propor-
tional to the Poynting vector (hence the name),

Ων = (cid:18)0,

c (cid:19) .
E ∧ H

(71)

In this case the eﬀective energy–momentum tensor of the
ﬁeld takes the form

S/c σ (cid:19)
Ab = (cid:18) I S/c
T µν

(72)

with intensity I, Poynting vector S, and stress tensor σ

(73)

We see that Abraham’s tensor describes indeed the eﬀec-
tive energy–momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, even
in the general case of a non–uniform medium that is able
to move under the pressure of light forces.

VI. CREDO

Light experiences dielectric matter as an eﬀective grav-
itational ﬁeld [1–4] and matter experiences light as a form
of gravity as well. Light and matter see each other as
dual space–time metrics, a unique model in ﬁeld theory,

to the knowledge of the author. We have solidiﬁed this
mental picture by postulating the idea and demonstrat-
ing its striking consistency with the theory of dielectrics
[1,14]. It would be interesting to see whether our model
can be derived directly from ﬁrst principles.
In pass-
ing, we have determined the energy–momentum tensor
that governs actio et reactio of electromagnetic ﬁelds in
quantum dielectrics. The tensor is Abraham’s [22] plus
the energy–momentum of the medium characterized by
a dielectric pressure and an enthalpy density.

Our idea may serve as a guiding line for understanding
the eﬀects of slow light [13] on matter waves. Here one
can conceive of creating light ﬁelds that appear to atoms
as quasi–astronomical objects. The holy grail in this ﬁeld
would be the creation of a black hole made of light.

Light and matter interact with each other as if both
were gravitational ﬁelds, and light and matter are gen-
uine quantum ﬁelds in Nature. A distinct quantum
regime of dielectrics has been prepared in the labora-
tories where Bose–Einstein condensates of alkali vapors
[17] interact non–resonantly with light quanta, but has
never been viewed as an analogue of quantum gravity, to
the knowledge of the author. Sound in superﬂuids [25]
and in alkali Bose–Einstein condensates [26] has been
considered as a quantum ﬁeld in a curved space–time,
as being able to emit the acoustic analogue of Hawking
radiation [27]. However, the quantum sound still propa-
gates in a classical medium, in contrast to light quanta
in a quantum dielectric. In many respects, we have rea-
sons to hope that Bose–Einstein condensates may serve
as testable prototype models for quantum gravity.

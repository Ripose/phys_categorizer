Abstract

The classical rotation is not self-consistent in the framework of the special theory of relativity. the

Relativistic rotation is obtained, which takes the relativistic eﬀect into account. It is demonstrated

that the angular frequency of classical rotation is only valid in local approximation. The properties

of the relativistic rotation and the relativistic transverse Doppler shift are discussed in this work.

INTRODUCTION

The special and general theory of relativity which was developed in the beginning of the

twentieth century, especially through Einstein’s work[1, 2, 3], has its roots far back in the

past. But the rotational reference systems utilized in the present researches of physics are

all classical[4, 5], although there exists the special and general theory of relativity. From

the classical rotation point of view, the velocity v of one point relative to the center of

circle is proportional to its distance r from the center of circle and its angular frequency ω0.

However, this relation is not suitable within the special relativistic theory.

The velocity formula of classical rotation is given as v = rω0. This simple formula

could be understood from the following three aspects. First, the foundation of experiments,

i.e., the experience of daily life. Second, Galilean transformations [4]. Third, the general

conclusion derived from the ﬁrst and the second points. Following the inference of Galilean

transformations, we could consider that the velocity formula of classical rotation is generally

come into existence under any rotational conditions, such as the condition of long-distance

and high-velocity.

However, the application of Galilean transformations in high-velocity condition is proved

early to be not reliable[4, 5]. It is not correct for the object with high velocity and must be

replaced with the principle that could embodies the relativistic properties. Therefore, the

extending velocity formula v = rω0 of classical rotation to arbitrary is suspicious, and it is

need to reevaluate. We should start from the special relativistic theory to reconsider the

rotation with high velocity.

So the proper relativistic four-dimension metric of rotational reference system should

be conﬁrmed. The four-dimension metric of the uniform rotational system is classical in

the general theory of relativity now[4, 5]. It means the proper relativistic present of the

rotational system couldn’t be given in the general theory of relativity. And the uniform

rotation is instantaneous and local inertial, so we think that we could research it in the

frame of the special theory of relativity.

To perform the relativistic analysis of uniform rotation, the Galilean transformations

and its deduced conclusion, i.e., the formula v = rω0 is extended to be correct in inﬁnite

distances, should be discarded. Nevertheless, we hold the opinion as usual experience that

the classical formula of rotation is applicable within short distances. In every observational

2

point, what the observer measures is just the rotational velocities in very close distances,

while for the rotational velocities far away from the observers, the calculation using the

transformation of velocity [4] in the special theory of relativity is needed.

We start from the analysis of classical rotation, and point out its non-self-consistent

disadvantage. A rotational formula of angular velocity with relativistic character is obtained,

which could reduce to classical velocity in the limit of non-relativity.

It shows that the

classical rotation is only local and slow-velocity approximation of the relativistic one.

II. THE RELATIVISTIC ROTATION

In classical rotation the velocity V of one point relative to another point is equal to the

product of its angular frequency ω0 and its distance from center point R.

V = Rω0

We show in Fig.1 the rotation of a long pole around point O with frequency ω0. We

assume that the pole is in a part of space so far from all masses that all gravitational

eﬀects can be neglected. The distance of point A and B from center point O is R and 2R,

respectively. Their velocities relative to the center point O are VAO = Rω0 and VBO = 2Rω0,

respectively, in the classical limit. However, if one considers the transformation formula of

the velocity in the special theory of relativity, the velocity of point B over point O becomes

(1)

(2)

V ′BO =

2Rω0
1 + (Rω0/c)2 6

= 2Rω0.

We can see from formula (2) that the velocity obtained from classical limit can not

coincide with the one derived from the relativistic one due to the use of the transformation

formula of the velocity in the special theory of relativity. It implies that the classical rotation

is not self-consistent in the framework of the special theory of relativity.

No one will suspect the accuracy of classical rotation formula in daily life.

In fact,

the correction term in the denominator of Eq.2 is nearly equal to zero under the ordinary

condition. Nevertheless, when the classical rotation formula is extended to inﬁnite, i.e.
Rω0 ≈
shown that this kind of formula can not fulﬁll the special theory of relativity. This motivates

c, the Galilean transformations is still applied but not the special relativity. It is

us to improve the classical rotation.

3

The relativistic rotational system can not be obtained through the general theory of

relativity, because it only gives the principle of equivalence having nothing to do with the

rotational system[4, 5]. Therefore, we start from the special theory of relativity to study the

rotational system, and to derive the kinematical equation of the relevant rotational system.

From the kinematical point of view, the investigation of the rotation based on the special

theory of relativity is suitable.

We can see from formula (2) that the velocity (Eq.1) of classical rotation is not correct for

the whole description of rotation under the framework of special relativity. In order to obtain

the suitable expression of the rotational velocity, we discard the assumption of formula (1)

for the whole-description and only consider it as the local approximation. The formula (1)
is only suitable in the limit of Rω0 ≪
discrepancy between the inertial and noninertial system if the gravitation is not taken into

c. Furthermore, we think that there is not intrinsic

account, and the instantaneous localization of rotational system is approximately regarded

as the inertial one. Moreover, the two adjacent systems of instantaneous localization fulﬁll

the principle of special relativity.

Taking point A as the reference point, we would determine the velocity of point B relative

to point A in the framework of special relativity using the former conditions.

FIG. 1: The sketch map of the rotating pole

In Fig.1 the observers at each point would see that the object in very small area rotates

uniformly around the point. Assuming that the distance between point A and B is R, we

now calculate the velocity of point B relative to point A at the rotating long-pole. Obviously,

we could not measure the velocity at point B directly. However, it could be measured via

the following method: the distance between point A and B is divided into n equal parts, and

each point in every equal parts could be considered as one instantaneous inertial reference

system. Therefore, the velocity of the point, where the distance from the original point is

∆R = R/n, could be measured, and the velocity of this point is V1 = ∆Rω0. Then, we

would measure the next ∆R position, where the distance from the original point is 2∆R, and

the velocity of position 2∆R relative to the position ∆R is also ∆Rω0. The measurement

is continued until reaching the position of R, and then, we could calculate the velocity of

the last point relative to the beginning point taking advantage of the relativistic velocity

transfer formula. Based on the relations of velocity in these instantaneous inertial system,

the velocity Vn is the very relativistic velocity Vre when n approaches inﬁnite.

The velocity of each point relative to point A is

The velocity of inertial system B relative to the one of A is the value of Vn in the limit

of n approaching inﬁnite. According to formula (3), we obtain

which is the expecting formula of relativistic rotation velocity. We calculate numerically

Considering the three points (A, B, and C) in the same line, we could calculate easily

the their velocity using the relativistic transfer formula of velocity and formula (13)

These show that the velocity relation in formula (13) is self-consistent in the framework of

special relativity, and now the relativistic space-time interval are diﬀerent with the classical

one[4]. It could be expressed in cylindrical coordinates

It is also observed from the comparison between formula (1) and (13) that the angular

velocity in the classical rotation is only the value in token of the frequency of relativistic

rotation, while not the real angular velocity of relativistic rotation. The relativistic angular

velocity ω of two points in relativistic rotation is no longer the physical invariable in the

classical rotation.

It is with respect to not only the token angular velocity but also the

distance of the two points, i.e.,

ω(r) =

c tanh(rω0/c)

(17)

It is obviously ω(r)

with the classical one. In classical rotation reference systems, what could be observed is

only within the range from observation point extending to c/ω0. Otherwise, with larger

distances, the observation velocity will greater than velocity of light that could not be

achieved by realistic objects. Nevertheless, in the relativistic rotation reference systems,

the former case could not exist. It could be found from formula (13) that all the velocity

are less than velocity of light c. Furthermore, the discrepancy of angular velocity with the

relativistic uniform rotation are generally not observed in the dailylife due to the condition
Rω0 ≪

c.

III. TRANSVERSE DOPPLER EFFECT IN RELATIVISTIC ROTATION

The expression of transverse Doppler eﬀect can be obtained from special relativity in

classical rotation [5]. For instance, there is a light-source with frequency ν0 at point B in

Fig.1. Following the Doppler formula in special relativity and formula (1), the frequency of

the light at point A in classical rotation is given as

νclassic = ν0q1

(Rω0/c)2

−

(18)

However, in relativistic rotation, through the Doppler formula in special relativity and

formula (13), the observed frequency of the light at point A is as follow

νrelativity = ν0q1

tanh2(Rω0/c) = ν0 cosh−

1(Rω0/c)

For further understanding, we plot in Fig.2 the transverse Doppler shift for classical and

FIG. 2: The transverse Doppler shift in the classic and relativistic rotation

relativistic rotations, respectively, for the comparison between formula (18) and (19). The

product Rω0 in classical rotation can not greater than velocity of light, otherwise, imaginary

number will occur in the frequency. However, in relativistic rotation, this product may

greater than the velocity of light, and the properties of νrelativity in equation (19) will not

be aﬀected. The diﬀerence of these two cases would only exhibit when the value of Rω0

approaches the velocity of light. Expanding the series of formula (18) and (19) to their

order with R4, We can get their diﬀerence

∆ν = νrelativity −

It is obviously showed in formula (20) that the discrepancy is hardly observed in ordinary

conditions. However, we may observe this discrepancy in the large-scale rotations such as

the rotation of galaxy.

IV. SUMMARY

The classical rotation which considers the rotation formula (1) as the whole-conditions is

not self-consistent in the special relativistic description. We propose the velocity expression

(13) of relativistic rotation taking advantage of formula (1) only as the local condition. This

velocity is self-consistent for the whole description of rotation. The relativistic rotation

can reduce to the classical one in the classical conditions, while greatly diﬀerent properties

are exhibited in comparison with the classical rotation in the relativistic condition, i.e.
Rω0 ∼
rotation would make one understand the phenomena of celestial rotations more suitably

c. With the ﬂourish development of astrophysics, the self-consistent relativistic

than the classical one. Moreover, the relativistic rotation may provide a feasible way for the

basic and theoretical description of rotation.

WRONG “ID´EES FIXES” IN GR

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. Six wrong id´ees ﬁxes concerning the black holes and the
gravitational waves.

“Id´ee ﬁxe, n. Idea that
dominates the mind, monomania.”
From “The Concise Oxford Dictionary”.

Id´ee ﬁxe N◦1

A widespread “Vulgate” of general relativity (GR) claims that if Schwarz-
schild problem – i.e. the problem of the Einsteinian gravitational ﬁeld gene-
rated by a point mass M at rest – is solved using co-ordinate-free methods
(such as orthonormal bases, etc.), the result is necessarily the standard form
of solution, erroneously named “by Schwarzschild”, in reality due to Hilbert,
Droste, Weyl.

This is a wrong id´ee ﬁxe: as a matter of fact, the procedure of the “Vul-
gate” is impaired by a vulgar logical fallacy, cf. e.g. R.M. Wald, General Rel-
ativity (The University of Chicago Press, Chicago; 1984), p.121, eq.(6.15):
only by writing r2(dϑ2 + sin2 ϑdϕ2) for the angular part, this author has
already chosen the standard HDW-form of solution. Remark that Birkhoﬀ
indeed, Schwarzschild’s original form of
theorem [1] is not in question:
solution [2] is diﬀeomorphic to the exterior part (r > 2m; m ≡ GM/c2;
G is the gravitational constant) of the standard form. The interior part
(0 < r < 2m) of this form presents various mathematical and physical de-
fects [3]; in particular, in the complete manifold of the HDW-form, i.e. for
0 < r < ∞, it is impossible to assign the time arrow for every time geodesic,
according to rational criteria (private communication by S.Antoci). On the
contrary, this diﬃculty does not exist for the original Schwarzschild’s form
[2], which is regular in the entire spacetime, with the only exception of the
origin r = 0 of the space co-ordinates, seat of the point mass M .

Id´ee ﬁxe N◦2

The undue privilege granted to standard HDW-form of solution of Schwarz-
schild problem and some physically senseless reﬂections on its interior part
(0 < r < 2m) have generated: i) the ﬁctive notion of black hole (BH); ii)
the id´ee ﬁxe according to which the continued gravitational collapse of a
suﬃciently massive celestial body must give origin to a BH.

Thus, Chandra Digest of February 18th, 2004 tells us that “Thanks to
two orbiting X-ray observatories, astronomers have the ﬁrst strong evidence

of a supermassive black hole ripping apart a star and consuming a portion of
it. The event, captured by NASA’s Chandra and ESA’s XMM-Newton X-
ray Observatories, had long been predicted by theory, but never conﬁrmed
. . . until now.”

This is science ﬁction! In reality, the observations reveal only the action of
the very strong tidal eﬀects produced by an enormous mass concentrated
in a “punctual” volume. The original Schwarzschild’s ds2 [2], for instance,
interprets perfectly the observational data.

The continued gravitational collapse can be described very generally in
a simple and concise way. Remark, ﬁrst of all, that the necessary and
suﬃcient condition that a Riemann-Einstein spacetime admit the group of
spatial rotations is that its ds2 be reducible to the following form, where
r, ϑ, ϕ are polar spherical co-ordinates [4]:

Let us consider a collapsing spherical body of mass M . As it is well known,
the Einsteinian gravitational ﬁeld outside the body is time independent, and
can be described consequently by the following ds2 [5]:

The physical results are independent of the choice of the function f (r) –
and this is true, in particular, for the above communication of the Chandra
Digest.

Id´ee ﬁxe N◦3

It consists of the conviction that in the motions of gravitationally inter-
acting masses an essential role is played by the gravitational waves. Now,
it can be proved with the well known method of Einstein-Infeld-Hoﬀmann
(EIH) that in a ﬁrst approximation the above motions are Newtonian, then
the successive approximations yield some (relatively) small corrections. But
no gravitational wave is present [6]. In recent years I have given several exact
(i.e. non-approximate) proofs of the physical non-existence of gravitational
waves in the motions of the masses [7].

WRONG “ID´EES FIXES” IN GR

Id´ee ﬁxe N◦4

It is obvious that the notion of gravitational wave, as an object endowed
with a physical reality, requires the existence of a class of physically privi-
leged reference frames.

Fock tried to prove quite generally that also in GR we have a class of this
kind: the set of the so-called harmonic systems [8]. But Fock’s arguments are
not rigorous – and on the other hand GR, if properly understood, does not
allow the existence of privileged co-ordinate systems. Another vain attempt
is due to Bondi et alii [9], who tried to prove the existence of a class of
privileged frames insofar as the gravitational waves solely are concerned.

Id´ee ﬁxe N◦5

It regards the conceptual adequacy, for the treatment of the gravitational
waves, of the linearized version of GR. Now, in a beautiful article of 1944
Hermann Weyl proved the mathematical and physical inadequacy of the
linear approximation of GR, just under the above respect [10]. It is a pity
that the astrophysical community ignore Weyl’s demonstration.

It follows, in particular, from Weyl’s paper that the various computations
regarding the behaviour of the famous radiopulsar PSR1913+16 are fully
destitute of a physical value.

Id´ee ﬁxe N◦6

It consists of the settled belief that the gravitational wave generates a
certain gravitational ﬁeld. Since this hypothetical wave does not possess
a true energy-momentum, but only a pseudo (false) energy-momentum (a
‘mathematical ﬁction”, according to Eddington) the above id´ees ﬁxe is pure
nonsense.

Final remarks

Many id´ees ﬁxes regarding the BH’s and the GW’s are contained, respec-

tively, in the review articles by Celotti et alii [11] and by Schutz [12].

In the golden booklet by Albert Einstein The Meaning of Relativity (1955)

there is no mention of BH’s and GW’s.

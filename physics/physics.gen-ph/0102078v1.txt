Fuzzy, Non Commutative SpaceTime: A New
Paradigm for A New Century

Abstract

Much of twentieth century physics, whether it be Classical or Quantum,
has been based on the concept of spacetime as a diﬀerentiable manifold. While
this work has culminated in the standard model, it is now generally accepted
that in the light of recent experimental results, we have to go beyond the
standard model. On the other hand Quantum SuperString Theory and a re-
cent model of Quantized Spacetime in which, for example, an electron can
be meaningfully described by the Kerr-Newman metric, have shown promise.
They lead to mathematically identical spacetime-energy-momenta commuta-
tion relations, and infact an identical non commutative geometry which is a
departure from the usual concept of spacetime. This could well be a new
paradigm for the new century.

Introduction

At the beginning of the twentieth century several Physicists including Poincare and
Abraham amongst others were tinkering unsuccessfully with the problem of the
extended electron[1, 2]. The problem was that an extended electron appeared to
contradict Special Relativity, while on the other hand, the limit of a point particle
lead to inexplicable inﬁnities. These inﬁnities dogged physics for many decades.
Infact the Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle straightaway leads to inﬁnities in the
limit of spacetime points. It was only through the artiﬁce of renormalization that
’t Hooft could ﬁnally circumvent this vexing problem, in the 1970s (Cf. paper by ’t
Hooft in this volume).
Nevertheless it has been realized that the concept of spacetime points is only
approximate[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. We are beginning to realize that it may be more meaning-
ful to speak in terms of spacetime foam, strings, branes, non commutative geometry,
fuzzy spacetime and so on[8]. This is what we will now discuss.

2 Two Approaches

We now consider the well known theory of Quantum SuperStrings and also an ap-
proach in which an electron is considered to be a Kerr-Newman Black Hole, with
the additional input of fuzzy spacetime.
As is well known, String Theory originated from phonenomenological considera-
tions in the late sixties through the pioneering work of Veneziano, Nambu and

others to explain features like the s-t channel dual resonance scattering and Regge
trajectories[9]. Originally strings were conceived as one dimensional objects with
an extension of the order of the Compton wavelength, which would fudge the point
vertices of the s-t channel scattering graphs, so that both would eﬀectively corre-
spond to one another (Cf.ref.[9]).
The string itself is governed by the equation[10]

T being the tension of the string, which has to be introduced in the theory, l

The string eﬀectively shows up as an inﬁnite collection of Harmonic Oscillators [10].
It follows from the above that the length l of the string turns out to be the Compton
wavelength, a circumstance which has been described as one of the miracles of String
Theory by Veneziano[11].
The above strings are really Bosonic strings. Raimond[12], Scherk[13] and others
laid the foundation for the theory of Fermionic strings. Essentially the relativistic
Quantized String is given a rotation, when we get back the equation for Regge
trajectories,

(6)

Attention must be drawn to the additional term a0 which now appears in (6). It
arises from a zero point energy eﬀect. When a0 = 1 we have gauge Bosons while
a0 = 2 describes the gravitons. In the full theory of Quantum Super Strings, we are
essentially dealing with extended objects rotating with the velocity of light, rather
like spinning black holes. The spatial extention is at the Planck scale while features
like extra space time dimensions which are curled up in the Kaluza Klein sense and,
as we will see, non commutative geometry appear[14, 15].
The above considerations raise the question, can a charged elementary particle be
pictured as a Kerr Newman Black Hole, though in a Quantum Mechanical context
rather than the General Relativistic case? Indeed it is well known that the Kerr
Newman Black Hole itself mimics the electron remarkably well including the purely

Quantum Mechanical anomalous g = 2 factor[16]. The problem is that there would
be a naked singularity, that is the radius would become complex,

(cid:19)

where a is the angular momentum per unit mass.
This problem has been studied in detail by the author in recent years[1, 17, 18].
Indeed it is quite remarkable that the position coordinate of an electron in the Dirac
theory is non Hermitian and mimics equation (7), being given by

x = (c2p1H

−1t + a1) +

ı

c¯h(α1 −

where the imaginary parts of (7) and (8) are both of the order of the Compton
wavelength.
The key to understanding the unacceptable imaginary part was given by Dirac
himself[19], in terms of Zitterbewegung. The point is that according to the Heisen-
berg Uncertainity Principle, space time points themselves are not meaningful- only
space time intervals have meaning, and we are really speaking of averages over such
intervals, which are atleast of the order of the Compton scale. Once this is kept in
mind, the imaginary term disappears on averaging over the Compton scale.
Indeed, from a classical point of view also, in the extreme relativistic case, as is
well known there is an extension of the order of the Compton wavelength, within
which we encounter meaningless negative energies[20]. With this proviso, it has
been shown that we could think of an electron as a spinning Kerr Newman Black
Hole. This has received independent support from the work of Nottale[21].

3 Non Commutative Geometry

We are thus lead to the picture where there is a cut oﬀ in space time intervals as
indicated in the introduction.
In the above two scenarios, the cut oﬀ is at the Compton scale (l, τ ). Such discrete
space time models compatible with Special Relativity have been studied for a long
time by Snyder and several other scholars[22, 23, 24]. In this case it is well known
that we have the following non commutative geometry

(7)

(8)

(9)

[x, y] = (ıa2/¯h)Lz,[t, x] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mx,

[y, z] = (ıa2/¯h)Lx,[t, y] = (ıa2/¯hc)My,
[z, x] = (ıa2/¯h)Ly,[t, z] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mz,

where a is the minimum natural unit and Lx, Mx etc. have their usual signiﬁcance.
Moreover in this case there is also a correction to the usual Quantum Mechanical
commutation relations, which are now given by

[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2

x];

[t, pt] = ı¯h[1

(a/¯hc)2p2

t ];

−

[x, py] = [y, px] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpy;
[x, pt] = c2[px,t] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpt; etc.

(10)

where pµ denotes the four momentum.
In the Kerr Newman model for the electron alluded to above (or generally for a
spinning sphere of spin

Fermion and the commutation relations (9) and (10) reduce to

≈
where β = (px/¯h)2 and similar equations.
Interestingly the non commutative geometry given in (11) can be shown to lead to
the representation of Dirac matrices and the Dirac equation[25]. From here we can
get the Klein Gordon equation, as is well known[26, 27], or alternatively we deduce
the massless string equation (1), using (4).
This is also the case with superstrings where Dirac spinors are introduced, as indi-
cated in Section 2. Infact in QSS also we have equations mathematically identical
to the relations (11) containing momenta. This, which implies (9), can now be seen
to be the origin of non-commutativity.
The non commutative geometry and fuzzyness is contained in (11). Infact fuzzy
spaces have been investigated in detail by Madore and others[28, 29], and we are
lead back to the equation (11). The fuzzyness which is closely tied up with the
non commutative feature is symptomatic of the breakdown of the concept of the
spacetime points and point particles at small scales or high energies. As has been
noted by Snyder, Witten, and several other scholars, the divergences encountered
in Quantum Field Theory are symptomatic of precisely such an extrapolation to
spacetime points and which necessitates devices like renormalization. As Witten
points out[30], ”in developing relativity, Einstein assumed that the space time co-
ordinates were Bosonic; Fermions had not yet been discovered!... The structure of
space time is enriched by Fermionic as well as Bosonic coordinates.”
Interestingly, starting from equation (11), we can deduce that l is the Compton
wavelength without however assuming it to be so. Let us write the ﬁrst equation
of (11) as

The relation (12) shows that y plays a role similar to the x component of the
momentum, and infact mathematically we have

[x, y] = ıH

y =

px ≡

At the extreme energies and speeds, we would have

y = ˜hp = ˜hmc, m ˙y = py, x = ˜hpy

where l is now the Compton wavelength. This is the explanation for the so called
miraculous emergence of the Compton wavelength in string theory, as noted by
Veneziano (Cf.ref.[11]).
Finally it may be pointed out that the tension T of String Theory, appears as the
energy of the Quantum Mechanical Kerr Newman Black Hole alluded to in Section
2 via the relation (3).
We next have to see how, from the Compton scale above, we arrive at the Planck
scale of QSS. For this, we note that from (11), using

we get,

Witten describes it as an extra correction to the Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle.
As long as we are at usual energies, we have the usual Uncertainity Principle, and
the usual bosonic or commutative spacetime. At high energies however we encounter
= ¯hl2. With this, the Compton scale goes over from
the extra term in (17) viz., ¯h
l to l3, the Planck scale (Cf. also [31]). Equally interesting is the fact that as
can be seen from (17), the single x dimension gets trebled. At these Planck scales,
therefore, a total of six extra dimensions appear, which are curled up in the Kaluza
Klein sense at the Planck scale. This provides an explanation for the puzzling six
extra dimensions of QSS.

4 Further Issues

(i) Vortices

As described in detail in [17] the Quantum Mechanical Kerr-Newman Black Hole
could also be considered to be a vortex. If we take two parallel spinning vortices
separated by a distance d then the angular velocity is given by

where ν = h/m.
Whence the spin of the system turns out to be h, that is in usual units the spin is

ω =

one, and the above gives the states
There is also the case where the two above vortices are anti parallel. In this case
there is no spin, but rather there is the linear velocity given by

v = ν/2πd

1, 0, +1 states of spin 1 as in the

This corresponds to the state 0 in the spin 1 case.
Together, the two above cases give the three
Quantum Mechanical Theory.
In the case of the Quantum Mechanical Kerr-Newman Black Hole hydrodynamical
vortex pictured above, it is interesting that for the bound state, there is really no
interaction in the particle physics sense. The interaction comes in because in the
above description we really identify a background Zero Point Field with the hy-
drodynamical ﬂow (Cf.ref.[18] and also[32]). Interestingly in a simulation involving
vortices, such an ”attraction” was noticed[33].

(ii) Monopoles

It is interesting that the above considerations lead to a characterization of the
elusive monopole. Infact a non commutative geometry can be associated with a
powerful magnetic ﬁeld[34], and specialising to the equations (11) we can show that
this ﬁeld B satisﬁes,

Bl2

which is the celebrated equation of the monopole.

(iii) Duality

A related concept, which one encounters also in String Theory is Duality. Infact
the relation (11) leads to (Cf. also equation (17),

∆x

∆p

∼

In String Theory this is an expression of the duality relation,

This is symptomatic of the fact that we cannot go down to arbitrarily small space-
time intervals, below the Planck scale in this case (Cf.ref.[14]).
In the Quantum Mechanical Kerr-Newman Black Hole model of the electron, on
the contrary, we are at Compton scale, and the eﬀect of (18) is precisely that seen
in point 1 above: We go from the electric charge e to the monopole, as in the Olive-
Montonen duality[35], (Cf.also ref.[14]).

(iv) Spin

One could argue that the non commutative relations (11) are an expression of Quan-
tum Mechanical spin. To put it brieﬂy, for a spinning particle the non commutativity
arises when we go from canonical to covariant position variables. Zakrzewsk[36] has
shown that we have the Poisson bracket relation

xj, xk

{

m2 Rjk, (c = 1),

where Rjk is the spin. The passage to Quantum Theory then leads us back to the
relation (11).
Conversely it was shown that the relations (11) imply Quantum Mechanical spin[5].
Another way of seeing this is to observe as noted in (13) that (11) implies that
y = αˆpy, where α is a dimensional constant viz [T /M ] and ˆpy is the analogue of the
momentum, but with the Planck constant replaced by l2. So the spin is given by

as required.

(v) Extremal Black Holes

Going back to the relation (7), we can see that if

then we are at the Planck scale and have a Planck mass Schwarzchild Black Hole.
The purely Quantum Mechanical Compton length equals the classical Schwarzchild
radius.
Also if,

while at the same time the particlee has no spin, so that a = 0, we recover a
electron mass then the
Schwarzchild Black Hole. We observe that if the mass M
charge Q from (19) turns out to be

indicate is given by

(20)

It was further argued[37] that a neutrino could in principle have an electric charge,
a millionth that of the electron, while, as the neutrino has no Compton wavelength
we can apply in principle equation (19). (20) coupled with this and with the above
electric charge shows that indeed equation (19) is satisﬁed.
Such particles however have a very high Bekenstein temperature

(vi) Spacetime

We have seen that the spacetime given by (11) is radically diﬀerent from its usual
description. Infact the usual spacetime is a sort of a stationary spacetime, a low
energy approximation, as will be clear by the following argument. We start with
ıU , due
the Nelsonian theory in which there is a complex velocity potential V
to a double Weiner process. This has been shown to lead to the usual Quantum
Mechanical description[38]. Indeed the diﬀusion equation,

which is the usual Heisenberg description.
Using the W KB approximation, the Nelsonian wave function

that is the probability densityh ρ and hence from (21) the momentum varies very
slowly with x.
The continuity equation now gives

(21)

which shows that ρ is independent of t also[18]. This is a scenario of, strictly speak-
ing, a single particle universe, without environmental eﬀects, a scenario which is
an approximation valid for small incremental changes. (The more physical scenario
takes all the particles in the universe into account, leading to what may be called
stochastic holism[32]). In this case, we can take limits to vanishing spacetime inter-
vals, as in the usual theory (Cf. ’t Hooft loc. cit). Spacetime in this description is a
diﬀerentiable manifold and instead of the relations (11), spacetime is commutative.
Eﬀectively we are neglecting l2. This has been the backbone of twentieth century
physics.
On the other hand according to Witten[39], ”String Theory is a part of twenty-ﬁrst
century physics that fell by chance into the twentieth century.” It does appear that
non commutative fuzzy spacetime is a paradigm for the twenty-ﬁrst century.

Abstract

A simple algebraic expression is presented to correct men’s and women’s 100 metre sprint

times for ambient wind and altitude eﬀects. The simpliﬁed formula is derived from a

more complicated equation of motion used to model the athlete’s velocity as a function

of time (the velocity curve). This method predicts adjustments to 0-wind and 0-altitude

equivalents, which are in excellent agreement to other estimates presented in the literature.

The expression is easily programmable on any computer, and could conveniently be used

by coaches, meet directors, or the media to assess the performance of athletes and the

quality of a race immediately following the event.

Introduction

Although not oﬃcially recognized by the International Amateur Athletic
Federation (IAAF), correcting sprint race times for the eﬀects of wind and
altitude variation is a subject of increasing interest in the Track and Field
community. With the number of men’s sub-9.90 s and women’s sub-10.80 s
clockings on the rise, correcting these marks to their sea-level, 0-wind equiv-
alents is useful in determining the overall quality of the performances (at the
time of competition). A literature search reveals rather detailed experimen-
tal ﬁeld studies of these eﬀects [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], as well as several theoretical
estimates based on mathematical and computational simulations [6, 7, 8].
Physically, linear drag forces (scaled to units of mass) are expressed as

Fd =

1
2

CdAρ(H)(v(t) − w)2 ,

(1)

where Cd is the drag coeﬃcient, A the frontal cross-sectional area, ρ(H)
the atmospheric density at altitude H, v(t) the sprinter’s velocity, and w the
wind speed (co-linear to v(t)). It follows that Fd will be smaller for tail-winds
(w > 0), and larger for head-winds (w < 0) at a ﬁxed altitude. Head-winds
and tail-winds of equal magnitude will not provide equal-magnitude time
corrections, due to the non-linear nature of the drag term.

At 0 metres altitude with 0 wind, the base drag is F0 = 1/2CdAρ0v(t)2,
where ρ0 = 1.184 g cm−3 is the mean sea-level density of air at 25 degrees
Celsius. Since air density varies exponentially as a function of altitude, a
convenient approximation can be written as ρ(H) = ρ0 exp(−0.000125 · H)
[1] for the range of elevations considered herein (less than 2300 m for the
majority of competition venues).

The general consensus of most researchers in question is that for a 10.00 s
race (average men’s world-class sprint), a tail-wind of +2 ms−1 will provide
an advantage of roughly 0.10 seconds (i.e. a faster time), whose value will
vary slightly depending on the altitude of the competition venue.
If the
wind gauge reads in excess of +2 ms−1, the performance is termed wind-
assisted, and is not eligible for any potential record status. Conversely
with no wind, an altitude of 1000 m will produce an advantage of 0.03 s,
above which performances are oﬃcially deemed altitude-assisted. Unlike
wind-assisted marks, an altitude-assisted time can still count for a record.
At 2000 m, the advantage will be about 0.06 s over a sea-level run. An
11.00 s time (average world-class women) will be boosted by about +0.12 s
with a +2 ms−1 tail-wind, and by 0.07 s (no wind) at 2000 m. As altitude
increases, the magnitude of the wind eﬀects will increase. Obviously, this is

2

a reasonable explanation for the rash of World Records (WRs) experienced
in the sprints and long jump at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, which
resides at an altitude of approximately 2250 m.

2 “Back-of-the-Envelope” correction: Derivation

A ”back-of-the-envelope” (BOTE) calculation is a simpliﬁed reduction of a
complex (physical) model, from which one can make reasonable predictions
with a minimal number of input parameters. An exact modeling of wind
and altitude eﬀects is a daunting task, since the mechanics involved are
numerous and not easily representable by basic functions (see [7] for such a
model). A historically-based method of such simulations is via the velocity
curve approach. This is a method of studying a sprinter’s performance, ﬁrst
introduced empirically by Hill [9] in the early 1900s, and further investigated
by Keller [10] as an equation of motion of the form

˙v(t) = Fp − v(t) α−1 ,

(2)

The term Fp is a propulsive term, while α is a decay term (representing
internal physiological or biomechanical variables). Note that again Equa-
tions (2) is scaled in units of the sprinter’s mass M , so the interpretation
of Fd is force per unit mass (or, eﬀectively, acceleration). Unless otherwise
speciﬁed, this notation is used for the remainder of the article.

This derivation roughly follows that of Reference [8], however the latter
incorrectly estimates the numerical value of certain key variables, and omits
the eﬀects of altitude all together. In fact, the author of [8] suggests that
altitude eﬀects on sprint times cannot be modeled by drag modiﬁcation
alone, which is not necessarily a correct assertion (as will be shown).

Equation (2) may easily be altered to include drag eﬀects by the addition

of Fd,

˙v(t) = Fp − v(t) α−1 − Fd ,

(3)

and a time dependence Fp → Fp(t) may also be added (see e.g. [7, 11, 12] for
such mechanisms). The BOTE expression presented herein, being simplis-
tic by its namesake, does not include these substitutions, and furthermore
imposes an additional simpliﬁcation of time-independence, v(t) → v, and
˙v(t) = 0.

To address the issue of wind and altitude correction, deﬁne as follows
v(w, H) (velocity of the sprinter at altitude H with wind w); v(0, 0) (velocity
with 0-wind, at sea-level); and Fd(w, H) (eﬀective drag for wind w and

3

altitude H). Subject to the constraint of constant velocity, Equation (3)
may be rewritten as

v(w, H) = α[Fp − Fd(w, H)] ,

v(0, 0) = α[Fp − Fd(0, 0)] ,

for each case described above.

Solving for α and equating the two expressions above yields

v(0, 0)
v(w, H)

=

(1 − Fd(0, 0)/Fp)
(1 − Fd(w, H)/Fp)

,

(4)

(5)

Deﬁne the ratio δ = Fd(0, 0)/Fp as the eﬀort required to overcome drag in
0-wind conditions at sea level. The numerical value of δ will be discussed
shortly.

Since velocity is constant (i.e. the average race velocity), one can write
v(w, H) = 100/tw,H , where tw,H is the oﬃcial time for the race under con-
sideration, and rewrite Equation (5) as

t0,0
tw,H

=

(1 − Fd(w, H)/Fp)

(1 − δ)

,

(6)

To simplify this expression further, note that the drag force for arbitrary

w and H can be written as

Fd(w, H) =

1
2

CdAρ(H)v(w, H)2(cid:18)1 −

exp(−0.000125 · H)(cid:18)1 −

w · tw,H

100 (cid:19)2

(7)

So, replacing (v(w, H)/v0) = (t0,0/tw,H),

Fd(w, H)

Fp

= δ  t0,0

tw,H!2

exp(−0.000125 · H)(cid:18)1 −

Unfortunately, this is now a quadratic expression in (t0,0/tw,H), but this
problem is quickly resolved by making the following substitution. Rewrite
(t0,0/tw,H) = 1 + ∆t/tw,H, with ∆t = t0,0 − tw,H. Since ∆t will seldom be
larger than 0.3 s for a ∼10 s race, it is reasonable to make the substitution

The numerical value of δ is determined as

(11)

(recall that the earlier deﬁnition of F is scaled in units of inverse mass,
hence the need for M in the denominator). Pritchard [8] initially found a
value of δ ≃ 0.032 (i.e. 3.2% of a sprinter’s eﬀort is required to overcome
drag), however this assumed an overestimated value of the drag coeﬃcient
Cd = 1.0, as well as the mean propulsive force Fp = 12.1 ms−2. Current
research suggests a drag coeﬃcient of Cd ∈ (0.5, 0.6) [7, 13], as well as an
average Fp ∼ 7 ms−2 [7, 11, 12].

For a 9.90 − 10.00 s race, the average velocity is between v = 10 −
10.1 m s−1. Taking the drag area to be Cd ·A = 0.23 m2 (consistent with the
quoted Cd values, and cross-sectional area A ∈ (0.4, 0.5) m2, for a sprinter
of mass 75 kg, one ﬁnds δ ∼ 0.027.

Since δ is small, 1/(1 − δ) ≃ (1 + δ), and including the approximation of

Equation (10), Equation (9) may be rearranged as

t0,0
tw,H

1 − δ(cid:19)"1 − δ exp(−0.000125 · H)  2

= (cid:18) 1
≃ 1 + δ − δ exp(−0.000125 · H) (cid:18)1 −

(12)

inserting the numerical value of δ, one obtains the “back-of-the-

Thus,
envelope” calculation

t0,0 ≃ tw,H[1.027 − 0.027 exp(−0.000125 · H)(1 − w · tw,H/100)2] .

(13)

For women, the input parameters Fp, A, v2, and M are smaller, so assuming
values v = (100/11) = 9.1 ms−1, M = 65 kg, Fp ∼ 5 ms−2, and A ∼ 0.35 m2,
δ remains essentially unchanged.

Equation (13) provides an excellent match to the predictions of Refer-
ence [7], as well as those of Dapena [2] and Linthorne [5]. Thus, 100 metre

5

sprint times may be corrected to their 0-wind, sea level equivalents by in-
putting only the oﬃcial time, the wind gauge reading, and the altitude of
the sporting venue. Furthermore, Equation (8) is easily programmable in
most scientiﬁc calculators and personal computers, and hence may be used
track-side by coaches, oﬃcials and the media immediately following a race
to gauge its overall “quality”.

3 Applications

To demonstrate the utility of Equation (13), Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 present the
corresponding corrections to the top ﬁve all-time men’s and women’s 100 m
performances run with legal tail-winds, illegal winds (w > +2.0 ms−1),
altitude eﬀects (H > 1000 m), and extreme head-winds (w < −1 ms−1).

The current 100 m World Record (as of June 2000) of 9.79 s by Maurice
Greene was run at low altitude with virtually no wind, and adjusts to 9.80 s.
Note that (Table 1) the 9.86 s performances of Trinidadian Ato Boldon and
Namibia’s Frank Fredericks were both run into head-winds of equal magni-
tude, but the altitude diﬀerence allows for a 0.02 s diﬀerential in corrected
times. The former World Record of 9.84 s by Canada’s Donovan Bailey cor-
rects to a 9.88 s. It is also interesting to note how exceptional performances
can be hampered by strong head-winds (Table 4).

The 10.49 s WR of the late Florence Griﬃth-Joyner is included in both
Table 1 and Table 2, to demonstrate the common belief that this mark was
strongly wind-aided (despite the fact that the oﬃcial wind gauge reading
was +0.0 ms−1, there is strong circumstantial evidence to suggest that the
equipment malfunctioned). Griﬃth-Joyner’s legal personal records (PRs)
correct to about 10.68 s, while her +2.1 ms−1 wind-aided 10.54 s (Seoul,
1988) corrects to 10.66 s. Thus, the actual WR mark should probably be
10.60-10.65 s (or a 0-wind, 0-altitude equivalent of about 10.66-10.68 s).
American Marion Jones’ current adjusted PR is 10.69 s, eﬀectively on par
with Griﬃth-Joyner’s best marks.

From a historical perspective, it is interesting to note that Calvin Smith’s
10.04 s (−2.2 ms−1) in 1983 would have converted to a 0-wind 9.93 s at sea
level. Smith’s actual WR of 9.93 s (+1.2 ms−1) was run at altitude (Col-
orado Springs, USA; 1850 m), correcting to only 10.03 s. The former WRs
of Canada’s Ben Johnson, 9.79 s (+1.1 ms−1) in Seoul, SKR, and 9.83 s
(+1.0 ms−1) in Rome, ITA, would correct to 9.85 s and 9.88 s, respec-
tively. Unfortunately, these marks were stricken as a result of performance-
enhancing drug infractions.

4 Conclusions

The presented “back-of-the-envelope” calculation is simple to use, and is
applicable to both men and women’s performances. An on-line JavaScript
version is available at the author’s website, currently

http://palmtree.physics.utoronto.ca/∼newt/track/wind/

It is hoped that its use may be eventually adopted by the IAAF and/or
other governing bodies of Athletics as a relative gauge of performance quality
under diﬀering competition conditions.

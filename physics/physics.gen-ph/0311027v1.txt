On the magnitude of the energy ﬂow inherent in zero-point radiation

Rafael Alvargonz´alez
Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain
(Dated: February 21, 2014)

The spectrum of zero-point radiation is relativistically invariant and its spectral density function
is therefore inversely proportional to the cubes of its wavelengths. For its energy to be ﬁnite, there
must exist a minimum wavelength, qλ. The measurements of the apparent attraction between two
uncharged conductor plates, placed in a vacuum at a temperature close to absolute zero, made by
Sparnaay in 1958 allow us to deduce that the energy ﬂow of the zero-point radiation which comes
of or into an area (qλ)2, corresponds with the emission of one photon of wavelength qλ per qτ
(qτ = qλ/c), plus one photon of wavelength 2qλ per 23qτ , etc., up to one photon of wavelength nqλ
per n3qτ . This energy ﬂow is enormous, but Sparnaay’s experiments implied only photons whose
−5 cm, and zero-point radiation may include only photons with
wavelengths were greater than 5 × 10
wavelengths greater than xqλ, being x an integer, perhaps very great.

INTRODUCTION

of zero-point radiation is

Sparnaay’s 1958 [1] experiments exposed the existence
of zero-point radiation, which Nernst had considered as
a possibility in 1916. However, this was not Sparnaay’s
intention, as he was only trying to check Casimir’s hypo-
thesis about the mutual attraction of two uncharged con-
ductor plates placed very close together in a vacuum [2].
This attraction must disappear when the temperature
approaches absolute zero, but Sparnaay found that at
that temperature there was still some attraction not ac-
counted for by Casimir’s hypothesis, being independent
of temperature and obeying a very simple law, it is di-
rectly proportional to the surface area of the plates, and
inversely proportional to the 4th power of the distance
“d” between them. Sparnaay observed this force when
the plates were located in a near-perfect vacuum at near-
zero absolute temperature. For a distance of 5 × 10−5 cm
between the plates, he was able to measure a force of 1.96
g cm s−2, and deduced the formula

f =

ks
d4 ;

where ks = 1.3 × 10

−18 erg cm

In a near-perfect vacuum and at near absolute zero
temperature, which means the absence of any “photon
gas”, the phenomenon observed by Sparnaay could only
be produced by a radiation inherent in space. This could
only be the case if its spectrum is relativistically invari-
ant, which could only happen if its spectral density func-
tion is inversely proportional to the cubes of the wave-
In other words, if the number of photons of
lengths.
wavelength λ, which strike a given area within a given
time is inversely proportional to λ3.

A function of spectral density inversely proportional
to the cubes of the wavelengths, implies a distribution of
energies which is inversely proportional to the 4th power
of the wavelengths, because the photons energies are in-
versely proportional to their wavelengths. In 1969, Timo-
thy H. Boyer [3] showed that the spectral density function

fϕ(λ) =

1
2π2

∗

;

(1)

where λ∗ is the number giving the measurement of wave-
length λ. This function produces the next for the corre-
sponding energies

Eϕ(λ) =

1
2π2
For λ → 0, Eϕ(λ) → ∞. There must therefore be a
threshold for λ, which will hereafter be designated by the
symbol qλ.

In the Sparnaay eﬀect, the presence of a force which
is inversely proportional to the 4th power of the distance
“d” between the plates, while the photons distribution
of energies is inversely proportional to the 4th power of
the wavelengths, leads us to infer that the cause of the
apparent attraction must lie in some factor which varies
inversely with wavelength and which produces a diﬀerent
behaviour in photons of wavelength equal to or greater
than “d”, since:

∞

Xn=1

−5 → k

The factor in question turns out to be the proportion
of photons which are reﬂected, not absorbed; that is the
coeﬃcient of reﬂection ρ, while the diﬀerent behaviour
is caused by the obstacle which each plate oﬀers to the
reﬂection by the inner plate of the other one, of photons
of wavelengths equal to or greater than “d”. As we know,
the energy which in transferred by a reﬂected photon is
double that transferred by one which is absorbed.

INTERPRETATION OF THE

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We now come to the title of this paper, an attempt
to ﬁnd the magnitude of the energy ﬂow which is in-

herent in zero-point radiation; two radiations with the
same spectrum, i.e. with the same energy distribution
by wavelength, can have very diﬀerent energy ﬂows.

The results of Sparnaay’s experiments provide a link
with reality which is enough to show the intensity of the
energy ﬂow belonging to zero-point radiation. So, re-
membering the requirement that in zero-point radiation
there must exist a threshold, qλ, for the wavelength of
the photons, we will now test the hypothesis that the re-
sults agree with an energy ﬂow which would produce the
incidence in a hypothetical area (qλ)2 of:

One photon of wavelength

qλ, per xqτ (qτ = qλ/c)

One photon of wavelength 2qλ, per x23qτ . . .

One photon of wavelength nqλ, per xn3qλ

This radiation implies an energy ﬂow of:

(3)

From Sparnaay’s experiments and our earlier argu-
ment, this energy ﬂow should cause the diﬀerence be-
tween the ﬂows transmitted to the outer faces, and those
transmitted to their inner faces to be:

∆Wλ = ρ

where n is the distance between the plates expressed in
qλ. Hence

∆Wλ = ρ

per (qλ)2.

(5)

To simplify the next stages of reasoning we will use
the system of measurement (e, mc, c), in which the basic
magnitudes are the quantum of electric charge e, the elec-
tron mass me, and the speed of light c. In this system the
units of length and time are respectively: le = e2/mec2,

te = e2/mec3; producing h =

2π
α

mel2
e
te

; c =

le
te

.

Clearly, if le = kλqλ, we have te = le/c = kλqλ/c =
kλqτ . On the other hand if n is the number representing
the measurement of the distance between the plates in qλ,
the number which represents it in le is Dle, Dlek being
equal to n. It must be remembered that kλ is certainly a
very large number; there have been detected cosmic rays
photons with wavelengths up to 1020 eV, which would
imply kλ values of the order of 2, 273 × 1011. The true
value of kλ could be much greater than this.

If in (5) we substitute qλ by le/kλ; qτ by te/kλ; n by

Dlekλ, and h by

, and remember that the ﬂow

per (le)2 is (kλ)2 times greater than the ﬂow per (qλ)2,
we can write

In (6) we ﬁnd that the factor kλ has disappeared. If
this were not so, we would arrive at absurd results, since
the value of ρ would be provided by:

ρ =

mec2/te

D4

le (kλ)a

For a > 0 ρ would be huge and for a < 0 ρ would
be tiny; it must be remembered that kλ must be greater
than 2, 273 × 1011. The values of ρ must always be less
that 1, and for a radiation where photons predominate
with wavelengths slightly greater than 5×10−5 cm, these
values must be greater than 0,4.

Since we must consider the energy ﬂows for both the
plates, we ﬁnd that they produce an apparent force of
attraction which can be expressed by:

In order to express (7) in terms of g s per cm2, we have
to include the transformation coeﬃcients 1 cm= kle le; 1
s= kte te; 1 g= kmeme, remembering to multiply by (kle )2
in order to move to forces per cm2, and that Dle = kle d
cm, from which we obtain the following force per cm2:

Since kle = 3, 548692 × 1012; kte = 1, 063871 × 1023;
kme = 1, 097668 × 1027; d = 5 × 10−5; by inserting these
values in (8), we reach

Zero-point radiation comes from all directions within
the half of space which is faced by the outer side of each
plate, and its normal component is given, for each direc-
tion, by F sen α, where α is the angle between the plane
of the plate and the direction in question. If we imagine a
sphere of radius F , it is not hard to see that the number
with measures the sum of the normal components is the
number which measures the volume of the hemisphere of
radius F∗, where F∗ is the number measuring F in the
system of units employed.

FIG. 1:

However ∆Wλ, as shown in (5), is not the ﬂow which
arrives from each and every direction in the said half-
space, but the sum of all the ﬂows which arrive from
all those directions. In order to make the necessary cor-
(F∗)3 by
rection we have only to divide the number
2π(F∗)2, which represents the area of the hemisphere of
radius F∗, this amounts to dividing the total sum be-
tween the total of the directions to be considered. The
resulting value is

However, this relation, which makes it easier to visu-
alize the problem, is not the correct one, because the
radiation which strikes at an angle ϕ from the vertical
has a trajectory between the plates which is given by
d/ cos ϕ (Fig. 1).

Therefore the value of ∆Wλ to be considered is:

This force is equal to F(e,me,c) cos4 ϕ and its compo-
nent normal to the plane of the plates is F(e,me,c) cos5 ϕ.
On ﬁg. 2 it can be seen that to each point P on the
circumference of radius F there corresponds a point Pϕ
whose coordinates are those of P multiplied by cos4 ϕ.
The points Pϕ form a line within the circle, and the sum
of the component normal to the plates is now given by
the volume produced by the area enclosed within that line
and by the axis of coordinates when it turns around the
axis OY , instead of the volume produced by the quad-
rant of circle turning around that axis. The volume in

FIG. 2:

question is given by the product of the said area and the
circle described by its center of gravity [4] (Fig. 2).

The parametric coordinates of the curve thus described

x = F∗ cos4 ϕ sen ϕ

y = F∗ cos5 ϕ

To the ordinate F∗ cos5 ϕ there corresponds the dif-
ferential element of abscissa F∗(cos5 ϕ − 4 cos3 ϕ sen2 ϕ).

The second of these pairs is unlikely for wavelengths
close to 5 × 10−5 cm. We can therefore deduce that the
energy ﬂow of zero-point radiation is the results of the
incidence, in an area (qλ)2, of:

One photon of wavelength

Given the importance of kλ, this force is huge and, at
ﬁrst sight, impossible to imagine. However, the rigor-
ous equality prevailing between the energy ﬂows arriving
from all directions of space implies that the results are
systematically nil. The presence of this force can only be
detected when its equality of arrival is disturbed, as a re-
sult of phenomena such as the Sparnaay eﬀect, or through
the interaction of the photons with free elemental par-
ticles. Obviously Sparnaay’s experiments implied only
photons whose wavelengths were greater than 5 × 10−5
cm, and zero-point radiation may include only photons
with wavelengths greater than xqλ, being x an integer
perhaps very great. Nonetheless the fact that this force
may be immensely great is a surprising datum in the re-
ality of the Universe. A surprising datum from which
surprising consequences may derive.

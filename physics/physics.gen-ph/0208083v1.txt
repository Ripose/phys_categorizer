Abstract – Recently, we have presented a local-ether wave equation incorporating a na-
ture frequency and the electric scalar potential, from which the speed-dependences in the
angular frequency and wavelength of matter wave, in the mass of particle, and in the energy
of quantum states are derived. These relations look like the postulates of de Broglie and
the Lorentz mass-variation law, except that the particle speed is referred speciﬁcally to a
geocentric inertial frame and hence incorporates earth’s rotation for earthbound particles.
Further, the wave equation is extended by connecting the scalar potential to the augmenta-
tion operator which is associated with a velocity diﬀerence between involved particles. Then
the electromagnetic force law is derived, which under some ordinary conditions reduces to
the modiﬁed Lorentz force law. In this investigation, the interaction of atoms with electro-
magnetic radiation is explored. Then it is shown that the time evolution equation derived
from the wave equation is substantially identical to Schr¨odinger’s equation incorporating
the vector potential, if the latter is observed in the atom frame and if the source generating
the vector potential is electrically neutralized, as in common practice.

1. Introduction

Recently, we have presented a wave equation which incorporates a natural frequency
ω0 and the electric scalar potential and is proposed to govern the matter wave associated
with a charged particle [1]. For a harmonic-like wavefunction, the wave equation leads to
a ﬁrst-order time evolution equation similar to Schr¨odinger’s equation. Then it has been
found that the energies of quantum states in an atom decrease with the atom speed by the
famous Lorentz speed-dependent mass-variation factor. The propagation of matter wave as
well as electromagnetic wave is supposed to follow the local-ether model [2]. Accordingly,
the position vectors, time derivatives, and velocities in this wave equation are all referred
speciﬁcally to an ECI (earth-centered inertial) frame for earthbound phenomena. Thus
the atom speed incorporates the linear velocity due to earth’s rotation. Consequently,
the quantum state energy and the transition frequency of an earthbound atom depend on
earth’s rotation, but are entirely independent of earth’s orbital motion around the Sun
or others. This eﬀect of earth’s rotation on atomic quantum properties has been used to
account for the east-west directional anisotropy in the atomic clock rate which in turn has
been demonstrated in the Hafele-Keating experiment with circumnavigation clocks. It also
accounts for the synchronism and the clock-rate adjustment in GPS (global positioning
system) and the spatial isotropy in the Hughes-Drever experiment [1].

Furthermore, from the local-ether evolution equation, the velocity and then the accel-
eration of a charged particle under the inﬂuence of the electric scalar potential have been
derived. Thus the electrostatic force is derived in conjunction with the consequence that
the natural frequency ω0 is related to the rest mass m0 of the particle in the familiar form
of m0 = ¯hω0/c2 [1]. Further, the local-ether wave equation is extended in such a way that
the electric scalar potential is made to connect to the augmentation operator which in turn
is associated with the momentum operator and the velocity of source practices. Then the
electromagnetic force law is derived. Under the low-speed condition, this law reduces to the
modiﬁed Lorentz force law [3].

In this investigation, we derive the eﬀect of the augmentation operator in the interaction
of atoms with electromagnetic radiation. Then the relation between the local-ether evolution
equation and Schr¨odinger’s equation incorporating the vector potential is explored.

2. Schr¨odinger’s Equation with Vector Potential

To begin with, we review the famous Schr¨odinger’s equation and its consequences. It
is well known that in the presence of the scalar potential Φ and the vector potential A,
Schr¨odinger’s equation reads

i¯h

ψ(r, t) =

[p − qA(r, t)]2ψ(r, t) + qΦ(r, t)ψ(r, t),

(1)

∂
∂t

2m0

where the operator p = −i¯h∇. The incorporation of the vector potential corresponds to the
understanding in classical mechanics that the mechanical momentum in the Hamiltonian is
given by the canonical momentum p minus qA.

It is known that in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld, an individual spectral line
of atoms will split into a set of closely spaced lines, known as the Zeeman splitting. The
Zeeman eﬀect has been accounted for by using quantum mechanics. For this familiar case
of interaction of a hydrogen-like atom with the electromagnetic radiation from an external
source, Schr¨odinger’s equation becomes [4, 5]

2m0

where Φa is the electric scalar (Coulomb) potential due to the nucleus of the atom itself
and A is the vector potential due to the external source. As in the literature, we have made
use of p · (Aψ) = A · pψ since p · A is taken to be zero. Physically, the Coulomb gauge
∇ · A = 0 implies that the source generating the vector potential is electrically neutralized,
as it is ordinarily. If the term p · A does not vanish, one has p · A/m0 = (i¯h/m0c2)∂Φ/∂t
from the Lorenz gauge, where potential Φ is due to the charge associated with the non-
neutralized current generating potential A. The angular frequency of an ordinary time-
harmonic potential is much lower than m0c2/¯h. Therefore, the term p·A/m0 is much weaker
than the corresponding potential Φ and hence is not expected to have an appreciable physical
consequence even if it does exist. In our understanding, the reference frame of the position
vector in wavefunction and potentials and that of the time derivative are not speciﬁed in
Schr¨odinger’s equation.

Moreover, from the generalized Ehrenfest’s theorem, the electromagnetic force exerted
on an unbounded charged particle due to the scalar and vector potentials can be given in
terms of the expectation values as [4]

where the magnetic ﬂux density B = ∇ × A. As noted in [4], in this formula the operator
p in (p − qA) does not commute with ﬁeld B. Thus the preceding force formula does not
agree exactly with the Lorentz force law. The discrepancy between these two force formulas
is expected to be (i¯hq/2m0)∇ × B. Although this discrepancy may be small in magnitude,
it has not yet solved to our knowledge.

3. Local-Ether Wave Equation and its Consequences

We then go on to consider the local-ether wave equation. It is postulated that under
the inﬂuence of the electric scalar potential Φ, the matter wave Ψ of a charged particle is
governed by the nonhomogeneous wave equation proposed to be [1]

Ψ(r, t) =

where the natural frequency ω0 as well as the charge q is an inherent constant of the particle,
and the position vector r and the time derivative are referred to the associated local-ether
frame, which is an ECI frame for earthbound particles.

If the potential Φ is weak, the wavefunction Ψ tends to be close to a space-time harmonic
eik·re−iωt, where ω2 = ω2
0 + c2k2. Thus it has been shown that the velocity of the particle is
given by v = kc2/ω and hence the angular frequency can be given by ω = ω0/
1 − v2/c2,
where the velocity v is referred speciﬁcally to the local-ether frame. As the natural frequency
ω0 is shown to be related to the rest mass m0, the speed-dependent mass m related to the
It is noted
frequency ω is then given by the familiar form of m = m0/
that these relations of the speed-dependent angular frequency and wavelength of matter
wave and of the speed-dependent mass of particle look like the postulates of de Broglie
and the Lorentz mass-variation law, except that the particle speed v is referred speciﬁcally
to the local-ether frame. Thereafter, by introducing the reduced wavefunction ψ given by
Ψ(r, t) = ψ(r, t)eik·re−iωt and by expanding the Laplacian and the time derivative in the
d’Alembertian operator, it has been shown that the preceding wave equation in Ψ reduces
to the ﬁrst-order time evolution equation in ψ [1]. That is,

1 − v2/c2 [1].

Again, the position vector r here is referred to the local-ether frame.

Consider a hydrogen-like atom which is moving at a velocity va with respect to the
local-ether frame. It is expected that the electric scalar potential Φa due to the nucleus
of the atom will move with this atom. Accordingly, this potential is stationary in the
atom frame with respect to which the atom is stationary, while it is moving in the local-
ether frame. Under Galilean transformations, the potential comoving with the atom can
be written as Φa(r) or as Φa(r − vat), where the position vector r is referred to the atom
or to the local-ether frame, respectively. The average value of the velocity of the electron
bounded in the atom should be identical to the atom velocity va; otherwise, the electron
tends to escape from the atom. Thus the spatial and temporal variation of the wavefunction
of the bounded electron can be expected to be close to the factored-out harmonic eik·re−iωt
and then the reduced wavefunction is governed by the preceding evolution equation, where
a/c2, the
the propagation vector k = mva/¯h, the speed-dependent mass m = m0/
potential is given by Φa(r − vat), and the position vector r is referred to the local-ether

where the position vector r and hence the time derivative are referred to the atom frame,
instead of the local-ether one. It is noted that the time derivative connects with an extra
a/c2. However,
multiplying term of ω/ω0 which is just the mass-variation factor 1/
except for this factor, the time evolution equation as well as the potential is independent of
the motion of atom if the atom frame is adopted as the reference frame. Consequently, the
solutions for the eigenfunction ψ and the eigenvalue ¯h˜ω(ω/ω0) of this equation in the atom
frame will be independent of the atom speed va. Accordingly, as compared to that of a
stationary atom, the energy ¯h˜ω of each quantum state will decrease with the inverse of the

mass-variation factor when the atom is moving at speed va with respect to the local-ether
frame.

The frequency of light emitted from or absorbed by an atom is known to be equal to the
transition frequency which in turn is proportional to the diﬀerence in energy between two
involved quantum states. Thus the transition frequency f is determined by the energy ¯h˜ω
and then decreases with increasing atom speed by the inverse of the mass-variation factor.
That is,

f = f0

1 − v2

a/c2,

(8)

p

where the atom speed va is referred speciﬁcally to the local-ether frame and f0 is the rest
transition frequency of the atom when it is stationary in this frame. Consequently, the tran-
sition frequency and hence the clock rate of earthbound atomic clocks depend on earth’s
rotation, but are entirely independent of earth’s orbital motion. Thereby, the atomic clock
ﬂying westward tends to have a lower speed and tick at a faster rate than the one ﬂying
eastward. Thus the preceding formula accounts for the east-west directional anisotropy in
atomic clock rate demonstrated in the Hafele-Keating experiment with circumnavigation
clocks. On the other hand, for a geostationary atom or an atom onboard an earth’s satel-
lite moving in a circular orbit, the speed va and hence the transition frequency f remain
unchanged with the passage of time. Thus the preceding formula also accounts for the
high synchronism among the various GPS atomic clocks moving in nearly circular orbits
and for the spatial isotropy in transition frequency in the Hughes-Drever experiment with
geostationary atoms [1].

Moreover, in order to derive the whole electromagnetic force, it is proposed that the
wave equation is modiﬁed by connecting the potential Φ to a dimensionless operator U . For
the electric scalar potential Φ due to source particles of a given velocity vs with respect to
the local-ether frame, it is postulated that the local-ether wave equation incorporates the
operator U [3]. That is,

(10)

The operator U tends to enhance the eﬀect of the electric scalar potential and hence is called
the augmentation operator. Again, the local-ether wave equation can lead to a ﬁrst-order
time evolution equation in terms of the reduced wavefunction ψ. When the particle speed
is low and then the propagation vector k in the factored-out harmonic is taken to zero, the
evolution equation reads

where the position vector r is referred to the local-ether frame. By evaluating the velocity
and then the acceleration of the charged particle under the inﬂuence of the electric scalar
potential connected to the augmentation operator in a quantum-mechanically approach, the
electromagnetic force exerted on the particle has been derived [3].

Consider the force law for the ordinary case where the source particles are drifting in a
matrix and the ions which constitute the matrix tend to electrically neutralize the mobile
particles, such as electrons in a metal wire. Suppose the neutralizing matrix is of an arbitrary
charge density ρm and moves as a whole at a velocity vm with respect to the local-ether
frame, while the mobile source particles are of charge density ρv and move at vs with respect
to this frame. Under the ordinary low-speed condition where all the involved particles move
slowly with respect to the local-ether frame and the sources drift very slowly with respect to

that the formula (12) is identical to the Lorentz force law, if the latter is observed in the
matrix frame, as done tacitly in common practice [3].

4. Modiﬁcations of Schr¨odinger’s Equation

In what follows, we derive from the local-ether wave equation the evolution equation for
the interaction of atoms with electromagnetic radiation. Consider an atom which is moving
at a velocity va with respect to the local-ether frame. Again, the spatial variation of the
wavefunction Ψ of the bounded electron is expected to be close to the space harmonic eik·r,
where the position vector r is referred to the local-ether frame. Thus the Laplacian becomes

where Ψ(r, t) = ˜ψ(r, t)eik·r and ˜ψ is a weak function of space. The term associated with k2
is neglected hereafter, as the atom speed va is supposed to be much lower than c. Thereby,
the local-ether wave equation (9) becomes

(cid:19)

It is seen that the incorporation of k is owing to the manipulation that the space harmonic
eik·r is factored out from Ψ.

Consider the ordinary case where the scalar potential Φ as well as the spatial rate of
variation of Ψ is weak. Thus the temporal variation of Ψ or ˜ψ is close to that of the harmonic
e−iω0t and then the wavefunction can be given as ˜ψ(r, t) = ψ(r, t)e−iω0t, where ψ is a weak
function of space and time. Then its second time derivative becomes

We then go on to rearrange the evolution equation to express it in the atom frame, instead
of the local-ether frame. The last term in the preceding equation can be written as −va ·∇ψ,
since the propagation vector can be given by k = m0va/¯h. Thus, by using the Galilean
transformation (6) again, the time evolution equation for the electron bounded in a moving
atom becomes

where the position vector r and hence the time derivative are referred to the atom frame.
As the potential in the preceding equation is given simply by Φ(r, t) with r being referred
to the atom frame, it has to be given by Φ(r − vat, t) in (19) with r being referred to the
local-ether frame.

Ordinarily, the electromagnetic radiation in the interaction of atoms comes from a
neutralized source. The electric scalar potential is supposed to be composed as Φ =
Φa + Φs + Φm, where Φa is due to the nucleus of the atom, Φs to the mobile charged
particles forming the current in an external source, and Φm to the matrix in this neutral-
ized source. Under complete neutralization, Φs = −Φm. Further, suppose the source is
stationary in the atom frame, that is, vm = va. Thus the Doppler frequency shift is not
involved. Then it is easy to show that

(Φs + Φm)(1 + Uk) =

where the augmentation operator connected to potential Φa is neglected as the eﬀect of
its inﬂuence on the quantum states is small in the interaction. Again, the potential Φa is
supposed to move with the atom and is stationary in the atom frame, while it is moving in
the local-ether frame. It is noted that the time evolution equation as well as the potential
is independent of the motion of atom if the atom frame is adopted as the reference frame.
The preceding evolution equation then looks like Schr¨odinger’s equation (2), except
the last term and the reference frame. The last term in the preceding equation is of the
second order of normalized speed vsm/c and is very weak as the drift speed vsm is very
low, while the corresponding one in Schr¨odinger’s equation is a quadratic term of qA. It
is seen that the latter is smaller in magnitude than the former by a factor of |qΦs|/m0c2
which in turn is much less than unity. Anyway, this second-order interaction is commonly
ignored in analysis [4, 5] and no quantitative measurements are reported, to our knowledge.
However, one fundamental diﬀerence is that the position vector, the time derivative, and the
drift velocity are referred speciﬁcally to the atom frame. In the perturbational treatment
of interaction, the quantum states of the unperturbed system are usually taken from the
solutions of Schr¨odinger’s equation with a stationary potential Φa. By so doing, one has
actually adopted the atom frame as the reference frame tacitly, although the result can
be frame-independent. Thereby, the preceding evolution equation is identical to
Schr¨odinger’s equation, if the latter is observed in the atom frame as done tacitly
in common practice. In other words, Schr¨odinger’s equation (2) with a stationary potential
Φa has some hidden restrictions. That is, the reference frame is actually the atom frame, the
atom speed is low in the local-ether frame, the source generating the interacting potential

6

is electrically neutralized and is stationary in the atom frame, and the drift speed in the
source is very low in this frame. However, these conditions are so common as to be ignored
easily.

The evolution equation (11), (20), or (23) then presents modiﬁcations of Schr¨odinger
equation, referred speciﬁcally either to the local-ether or to the atom frame. It is noted
that the atom-frame evolution equation (23) is independent of the atom velocity itself.
Therefore, its consequences comply with Galilean relativity and hence are independent of
earth’s motions. However, this is owing to the approximation that the k2 term in (15) is
omitted. When this second-order term is retained and hence the restriction of low atom
speed is removed, the eﬀect of earth’s rotation resumes as in the consequences of (7).

5. Conclusion

Based on the local-ether wave equation incorporating a nature frequency, the electric
scalar potential, and the augmentation operator, the ﬁrst-order time evolution equation is
derived for a harmonic-like wavefunction. Then the eﬀect of the augmentation operator
in the interaction of atoms with electromagnetic radiation is discussed. Except a small
second-order term, this evolution equation can be identical to Schr¨odinger’s equation with
the vector potential, if the latter is observed in the atom frame. In common practice, this
frame has been adopted tacitly as the reference frame, as the scalar potential due to the
atom is taken to be stationary. The predicted second-order interaction is stronger than the
one in Schr¨odinger’s equation and might provide a means to test the modiﬁed equation.

Besides, the local-ether wave equation leads to the speed-dependences in the angular
frequency and wavelength of matter wave, in the mass of particle, and in the energy of
quantum states. Thus it provides the physical origin of the postulates of de Broglie and the
Lorentz mass-variation law. Moreover, it accounts for the east-west directional anisotropy
in the Hafele-Keating experiment, the synchronism in GPS, and for the spatial isotropy in
the Hughes-Drever experiment. It also leads to the electromagnetic force law in conjunction
with the physical origin of the inertial mass. Thus the local-ether wave equation and the
modiﬁed Schr¨odinger equation account for a variety of phenomena in a consistent way.

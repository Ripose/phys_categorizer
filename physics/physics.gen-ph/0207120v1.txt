Abstract

A conceptual preon-based model of fermions is discussed. The preon is regarded as
a topological object with three degrees of freedom in a dual three-dimensional manifold.
It is shown that properties of this manifold give rise to a set of preon structures, which
resemble three families of fermions. The number of preons in each structure is easily
associated with the mass of a fermion. Being just a kind of zero-approximation to a
theory of particles and interactions below the quark scale, our model however predicts
masses of fermions with an accuracy of about 0.0002% without using any experimental
input parameters.

1 Introduction

The enigmatic hierarchical pattern observed in the masses of fermions (quarks and leptons) is
a challenge for all particle physics models beyond the Standard Model. Fundamental particles
are grouped into three generations, each containing two quarks and two leptons with electric
charges, spins and other properties repeating from generation to generation. The leptons inter-
act through the electromagnetic and weak (electro-weak) interactions and appear in pairs: the
electron and its neutrino (e−, νe), the muon and its neutrino (µ−, νµ), the tau and its neutrino
(τ −, ντ ). The quarks interact through the strong (coloured) interaction and also come in pairs:
up and down (u+2/3, d−1/3), charm and strange (c+2/3, s1/3), top and bottom (t+2/3, b−1/3). Here
the charges are indicated by superscripts. Each quark has three possible ﬂavours (colours), red,
2 particles (in the units of ~), and all of
green, and blue. Both quarks and leptons are spin- 1
them have their corresponding anti-particles. All particles, except neutrinos, can be found in
their right- or left-handed states. The right-handed counterparts of neutrinos have never been
observed. Diﬀerent combinations of quarks form hadrons, which include the proton (uud), the
neutron (udd), the Λ-baryon (uds), etc., and mesons: π+ (ud), η (dd), etc. It is believed that all
surrounding matter is made up of the particles belonging to the ﬁrst generation. The aﬃnity of
the quark and lepton pairs, their similar behaviour in the electro-weak interactions, and some
other striking similarities, insistently points to structures of matter beyond the scale of quarks
and leptons. However, the masses of these particles are distributed in a rather odd way [1].
They are shown in Table 1 in the units of the proton mass, mp. Masses of the charged leptons
(except τ ) are given with suﬃcient number of signiﬁcant digits in order to consider them as
exact values. The quark masses are not known with high accuracy and are given in the form
of quite wide allowed ranges.

Many models attribute this pattern to the geometry of space [2, 3, 4].
Indeed, the highly
successful Standard Model of particle physics is based on geometrical ideas (continuous trans-

formation groups) developed in XIX century by M.S.Lie. Thus, it would be of no surprise if
one ﬁnds the origin of the particle masses in geometry.

In this paper we shall consider a topological object discovered in 1882 by F.C.Klein (a collabo-
rator and friend of M.S.Lie) and show that this object necessarily generates a set of structures
with properties similar to those of the fundamental particles.

2 Starting point

To start with, we shall use the following postulates, which, in our opinion, are quite natural
and correspond to the common sense philosophy:

P1. Matter is structured, and the number of its sub-structures down to any given structural

level is ﬁnite. So far, the following structural levels of matter have been found:

• materials

• chemical substancies

• molecules

• atoms

• atomic nucleus

• nucleons

• quarks.

• quarks

• sub-quark level-1

• sub-quark level-2

• . . .

• sub-quark level-N (preons)

Each time, when a lower level of matter have being revealed (for example, atoms or
elementary particles), it was thought that this level is the ultimate and the simplest one.
But patterns in properties of the “elementary” particles always indicated that there are
underlying structures responsible for these properties. Due to the clear pattern in the
properties of fermions (Table 1) neither they might be considered to be the fundamental
constituents of matter. It is logical to think that matter is structured down to a simplest
possible object, which we refer hereafter “a preon”. It is quite possible that more than
one underlying structural levels of matter should exist between quarks and preons:

P2. The simplest (and, at the same time, the most complex) object in the universe is the

universe itself.

P3. The universe is self-consistent: there is nothing “outside” of the universe, and this “out-

side” doesn’t exist.

P4. All objects in the universe spin (including the universe itself).

All so far known structural levels of matter are formed in accordance with some common
laws (practically at all levels electric attractive and repulsive forces are responsible for existing
structures). There is no reason to think that something diﬀerent will be happening below the
quark scale.

Possible existence of more than one structural levels between quarks and preons complicates
the situation and makes it quite diﬃcult to ﬁgure out the origin of the fermion masses by just
trying to uncover the ﬁrst sub-quark structural level. Due to this, here we shall try to begin
our consideration from the simplest possible structure (the preon), ﬁguring out hierarchical
structures formed of the preons.

The postulate P2, considering the universe as the simplest structure, is not very new. In fact
this is the essence of modern Cosmology. The theories of General Relativity and of the Big Bang
assume that the universe is curved. But the character of this curvature (shape of the universe)
cannot be deduced from the Einstein’s equations without additional observations. Intuitively,
A.Einstein and A.Friedmann imagined the universe having spherical shape of positive, nega-
tive or zero curvature. But if we take into account the fact of the universe’s self-consistence,
the spherical shape becomes inappropriate because of the sphere having two (inner and outer)
surfaces. Applied to the universe this would mean the co-existence of two universes. The topol-
ogy corresponding to the fact of the universe’s self-consistence and uniqueness is the very well
known Klein bottle. Having a unique hyper-surface, the universe with the Klein bottle topol-
ogy, similarly to the sphere, can be of positive, negative or zero curvature. Schematically the
positively curved Klein bottle is show in Fig.1 (not very traditional representation, nevertheless
it is the Klein bottle). The main feature of this object is the uniﬁcation of its inner and outer
surfaces. In the case of the universe, the uniﬁcation might well be occurring at the sub-quark
level giving rise to structures of elementary particles. In Fig.1 the area of uniﬁcation is marked
with the symbol ⊓ (preon). Of course, in order to form structures there should be more than
one preon in the universe. This makes a diﬀerence between the topology of the universe and
the classical Klein bottle. We can call such an object a multi-connected Klein bottle. But
the main features of both topologies are similar: the duality and uniﬁcation of two opposite
manifestations of space, as well as the uniﬁcation of the cosmological scale with the scale of
elementary particles.

3 The preon

Within the area ⊓ (Fig.1) space is curved “inside-out” with ﬁnite curvature, which might be
a general feature of the universe. Two surfaces, I and II, are shown separated, but of course
the “normal” and the “inverted” parts of space should not be considered as separate entities.
They are just two aspects, or manifestations, of the same space. Given three-dimensionality of
space, both its “normal” and “inverted” manifestations should have three rotational degrees of
freedom, which are paired anti-symmetrically.

It comes just from the common sense and from the
The postulate P4 in not very obvious.
fact that so far no non-rotating objects have been found in the universe. But this postulate
immediately gives us an insite to the possible origin of the particle masses.

Rotating universe means acceleration, ag, of the preon because of the curved character of
space in its vicinity (Fig.1). And, according to the second Newton’s law, a force, Fg = mgag,

(II) manifestations of space are uniﬁed at the scale of elementary particles (area ⊓)

proportional to this acceleration should appear. The coeﬃcient of proportionality between the
acceleration and the force can be regarded as the preon’s inertial mass (mi). But of course, for an
observer, placed in the preon’s coordinate frame, this mass appears as the preon’s gravitational
mass (mg) because the preon is at rest in this coordinate frame. Rotation of the universe
should, in fact, mean the motion of the preon (together with the observer) along the time axis.
If now the preon is additionally forced to move along spatial coordinates (with acceleration ai),
it resists this motion exactly in the same way as it does when moving along the time-axis. A
force Fi = miai, which should be applied in order to accelerate the preon, is proportional to
mi, and the observer will conclude that the moving preon possesses its inertial mass mi. But,
in fact, its inertial, mi, and gravitational, mg, masses are generated by the same mechanism of
acceleration, and they are essentially the same thing; hence mi ≡ mg.

Three diﬀerent ﬂavours of the preons one can associate with either three rotational degrees
of freedom of three-dimensional space or with three dimensions of space. At the same time,
preons might be positively or negatively charged (⊓, ⊓ ∈ 3c), which should correspond to the
opposite spins of the “normal” and “inverted” space. We shall denote these three states with
the symbols ⊓i, ⊓i, having i = 0, 1, 2, in order to associate them with three ﬂavours (red, green
and blue).

Given the space inverted around the preon, distances z, measured from the centre of the preon,
change equivalently to their reciprocal values z′ = −1/z if considered within the inverted
manifestation of space. Thus, any potential, which is proportional to z−1, will be proportional to
1/z′ (or simply z) in the inverted manifestation of space. For example, the Coulomb potential,
which decreases with distance, will manifest itself as strong-like potential (increasing with
distance) and vice versa. This is illustrated in Fig.2, where the z-axis (abscissa) is mirror-
reﬂected from the preon’s centre in the operation of inversion of space. The xyz-coordinate
system is transformed into x′y′z′, with z′ = −z−1. We can assign a unit value to the distance
z0, at which |z| = |z′|.

We shall deﬁne a triplet of three-component vectors ⊓i (i = 0, 1, 2) as

taking into account the well-known properties of the coloured interaction (two like-charged but
unlike-ﬂavoured particles are attracted, otherwise they repel), we can characterise the repulsive
and attractive pattern of the chromo-electric interaction between two preons i and k by the
following normalised force Fik:

illustrating (3).

(the positive and negative signs correspond respectively to the strong and electric manifestations
of the chromo-electric interaction). This expression is graphically illustrated in Fig.3.

The chromo-electric interaction between preons necessarily lead to the formation of spatial
preon structures. The simplest structure is a charged preon doublet

(six possible combinations for ⊓ and six others for ⊓). A neutral preon doublet is also possible

dik = ⊓i + ⊓k,

i, k = 0, 1, 2

gik = ⊓i + ⊓k,

i, k = 0, 1, 2

(nine combinations). The doublets of preons will be deﬁcient in one or two ﬂavours having, for
example, the following ﬂavour charges for gik: r+g−, r+b−, g+b−, r−g+, r−b+, g−b+. The preons
in these doublets will be separated by the distance z0. According to (1) and (2), q(dik) = ±2,
m(dik) = 2, q(gik) = 0, m(gik) = 0. The latter fact can be considered as a result of opposite
motion of unlike-charged preons along the time axis, ict.

The electric charge is proportional to ∂(ict)/∂t, whereas the gravitational charge (mass), as-
sociated with the acceleration along the time axis, is proportional to ∂2(ict)/∂t2. It is easy to
see that, if the direction of motion changes either in the normal or inverted manifestations of
space, the charge changes its sign:

But the mass does not:

∂(ict)
∂t

≶ 0.

∂2(ict)
∂t2 > 0.
If we assign a unit value to the radius of curvature of space, the acceleration will be proportional
to c2. It is convenient here to use a unit value for the coeﬃcient of proportionality (mass of
the preon). Thus, the electric charge can be equivalently expressed in terms of the positive or
negative direction along the time axis (ict), and the acceleration (mass) can be cancelled if two
unlike-charged preons combine together.

4 Y-particle

Doublets dik will not be free for long because their strong potentials are inﬁnite at inﬁnite
distance. Any distant preon of the same charge but with a complementary ﬂavour will be
attracted to the doublet. In this way, the triplets

Y =

⊓i

or Y =

⊓i,

i = 0, 1, 2

2

i=0

will be formed. We shall graphically represent the Y-particle with three touching coloured
spheres or as a symbol Y coloured in red for the positively charged particle and in blue for
the negatively charged one. The mass of Y is 3 preon mass units, and its charge (positive or
negative) is of the same magnitude.

4.1 Y-doublets
Like the preons, Y-particles cannot be free because of their strong potential increasing with
distance. Due to the symmetric character of Y, two distant like-charged Y-particles will combine
in the “anti-parallel” way, maintaining equal distances between their six unlike-ﬂavoured preons.
In order to formalise representation of these structures let us introduce the following group of
matrices:

α0 = I =

.

Then a structure δ corresponding to “anti-parallel” coupling of two Y-particles can be written
as

δ = αiY + αiY.

(4)

with qδ = ±6, mδ = 6. The states corresponding to diﬀerent i are equivalent. For these
structures we shall use also a symbolic notation Y+∧+ or Y−∧− with ∧ indicating just the fact
that Y is rotated in space by π radians. The ﬂavour pattern of two anti-parallel combined
Y-particles can be written as

There is a diﬀerence between two possible states of γ corresponding to the clock-wise or anti-
clock-wise rotations (5). Structures (4) and (5) are shown in Fig.4 (a) and (b).

Figure 4: Two like-charged Y-particles coupling anti-parallel (a); and two unlike-charged Y-
particles coupling parallel (b).

4.2 Y-triplets
Given the three-ﬂavoured character of Y, we can see that the like-charged Y-particles can
form symmetric triple structures. There are eight possible states of the triplet, four of which
correspond to the positively charged Y:

eR =

and four others correspond to the negatively charged Y. These structures are charged and
massive with qe = ±9 and me = 9 (in the units of the preon’s charge and mass). The states e
and e′ have opposite spins. The structures (7) and (8) are shown in Fig.5 and 6.

4.3 Chains of Y-particles

Unlike-charged Y-particles can combine only when the initial distances between them are smaller
than z0 (i.e. at the early stages of the universe). Thus, Y+Y− (γ-particles) are probably were
the ﬁrst to appear. At the latter stages of the universe, when the distances between Y+Y−
exceed z0, these particles would be further conjoined and form chains Y+Y− ∧− ∧+ Y+Y− . . .

These are the patterns corresponding to two possible conﬁgurations (6) of the parallel-coupled
Y-particles. The patterns are mirror symmetric. They repeat after each six consecutive groups
forming a 12Y-period. The 12-th group is compatible with the ﬁrst one, which allows the closure
of the 12Y-chain in a loop:

The patterns (9) and (10) are visualised in Fig.7 (a and b), where brighter colours are assigned
to the negatively charged preons. The spatial distribution of any particular colour (say, red
positive) appears as a clock-wise (Fig.7a) or anti-clock-wise helix (Fig.7b), which makes a 2π-
turn along the toroidal surface. These ring-closed chains consisting of twelve Y-particles (36
preons) are neutral and massless according to (1) and (2). The helical ﬂavour patterns along
their rings correspond to the opposite spins of ν and ν′. Unlike eR and eL, the left and right-
handed states of the ν-particle are equivalent because of speciﬁc symmetry of ν with its even
number of Y-particles in the chain. The π-rotation of all the chain components around the
torus’ axis translates ν into itself, thus making νL topologically coinciding with νR. The simple
preon structures are summarised in Table 2.

5 Combining Y, e, and ν
The Y, e, and ν particles can combine because of their local ﬂavour patterns. The (Y+ν)-
structure will be massive and charged, with its charge qY ν = ±3, corresponding to the charge
of one Y-particle, and its mass mY ν = 39 preon mass units (mν +mY = 36+3). A combination of
e+ν will have charge of the e-particle (qνe = ±9) and mass of 45 mass units (mν +me = 36+9).
As Y, Yν cannot be free because of its strong potential increasing with distance. It will couple
further with other Yν-particles (via intermediate ν-particles of opposite spins) forming (Yν +
ν+Yν)-chains and so on. A single (Yν + ν+Yν)-chain, the up-quark, will have charge of
two Y-particles (qu = ±6) and mass of 78 mass units (mu = mY ν + mY ν = 39 + 39). The
positively charged up-quark can combine with the negatively charged e−ν with its 45-units
mass, forming the 123-mass units down-quark (md = mu + meν = 78 + 45) with its charge
qd = qu + qe = +6 − 9 = −3.

Figure 7: Two possible conﬁgurations of the 12Y-structure. The structures (a), with its clock-
wise helical colour pattern along its toroidal surface, and (b) with its anti-clock-wise helical
pattern correspond to two opposite spin-states of ν.

Coupling of 3Y with 12Y (e and ν) is caused by the three-ﬂavoured character of the chromo-
electric interaction, which is noticeable only at small distances (of the order of a few z0). We
can call this local chromo-electric interaction “weak”, just to distinguish it from the electric
interaction at “large” distances (d ≫ z0) where all three ﬂavours of the chromo-electric potential
are mixed together and are hardly detectable. Coupling of the particles depends on their spins
(ﬂavour patterns). The ﬂavour pattern of 12Y↑ does not match that of 3Y↓. Only 3Y↑ and 12Y↑
or 3Y↓ and 12Y↓ can combine. Unlike this case, if 3Y is combining with another 3Y, or 12Y
with another 12Y, their spins should be opposite.
Divided by nine, the charge of the 3Y-particle, gives us the conventional unit charge of the
electron. Charges of the Y and δ-particles (fractions of the nine-units electron charge) might
give us an indication of the quark’s constituents.
The Y12Y-structure with its 3-unit charge (1/3 in the units of the electron charge) cannot
be free because of its inﬁnite strong potential at inﬁnity. It will further combine with other
Y12Y-particles. Each two of Y12Y-particles with similar spins will be coupled via opposite-spin
neutrinos because colour patterns of the neutrinos with similar spins do not match each other.
The up and down quarks are visualised in Fig.8, where for simplicity neutrinos, Y-particles and
electrons are graphically represented as symbols O (in gray colour), Y, and e (in red or blue,
depending on their charge).

6 The second and third generations of particles

It is natural to suppose that particles of the second and third generations should be composed
of simpler structures belonging to the ﬁrst generation. For example, the muon neutrino (a
neutral particle) can be formed of positively and negatively charged Y+νe and Y−νe:

νµ = (12Y0

↓)12Y0

↑(∧−12Y0

↓) = (νeY+)νe(Y−νe),

and the muon could be naturally structured as

µ = (12Y0 + 3Y−Y+)(12Y0

↓12Y0

↑ ∧− 12Y0

↓) = ν ee−νµ,

which corresponds to one of the muon’s decay modes. Structures of other particles (derived also
from their known decay modes) are schematically shown in Fig.9. Their components should
not be considered as rigidly tied. The higher level structures are rather clusters or many-
body systems than single particles. In (11) and (12) we enclose the clustered components in
parenthesis. Interactions between the clustered components modify the mass of the system. We
suppose that, because of the inversion of space, the force acting on the components depends
both on the sum M of their masses mk:

and the sum M ′ of their reciprocal masses 1/mk (reduced mass):

We suppose the total mass of the composite system Mtotal is proportional to this force:

the unity of the product of two reciprocal distances, rr′ = 1, one can estimate masses of the

Using (16), we convert the preon mass units of the calculated masses into the proton mass units,
mp. In order to compare our calculated masses with experiment, , the experimental masses
(also expressed in the uits of mp) are repeated in the last column of Table 3.

Table 3 and Fig.8-Fig.12 illustrate family-to-family similarities in the particle structures. For
example, in each family, the down-like quark appears as a combination of the up-like quark, with
the charged lepton belonging to the lighter family. Charged leptons appear as a combination
of the neutrino from the same family with the neutrinos and charged leptons from the lighter
family. Ring structures similar to that of the the electron neutrino, may also appear as “heavy
neutrinos”, νh = 12(νe Y). They can further form “ultra-heavy” neutrinos νuh = 3(νeY−νhu)e−,
and so on.

7 Conclusions

Based on the concept of the dual curved space with its uniﬁed “normal” and “inverted” man-
ifestations, our model provides a reasonable explanation of the fermion masses. Being only a
conceptual, and a kind of zero-approximation to a theory of elementary particles and interac-
tions below the quark scale, our model nevertheless predicts quantum numbers and masses of
three generations of fermions. Masses are derived without using any experimental input param-
eters (in this sense our model is self-consistent). The obtained masses agree with experiment to
an accuracy of about 0.0002%. Our model probably might be helpful in the investigation of the
early universe. Such things as inﬂation, dark matter or dark energy might be better understood
and explained in the framework of our model. Of course, our approach can provoke questions.
For example, where is quantum mechanics, and where the quantum phenomena come from?
Also the preons (⊓+) and their negatively charged counterparts (⊓−) seems to form symmetric

Figure 10: Charm and strange quarks. The diﬀerence between them is due to 3Y (e−) in the
structure of the strange quark.

unities (⊓+, ⊓−) of inseparable opposites. Thus, the number of positive charges in the universe
should coinside with the number of negative charges. The conservation of charge should not be
violated. Even, for example, if the unlike-charged 3Y+ and 3Y− particles (e+ and e−) annihi-
late, the oppositely charged preons are just re-grouping into three neutral structures 3×Y+Y−
(3γ0) but not disappear. Then the question arise: Why matter is seems to be made up mostly
of particles and not anti-particles? or How and why the charge symmetry has been broken?
However, this is already another story.

Abstract

Time-like and space-like invariant space-time intervals are used to analyse measurements of
spatial and temporal distances deﬁned by two spatially-separated clocks. The time dilatation
eﬀect is conﬁrmed, but not ‘relativity of simultaneity’ or ‘relativistic length contraction’. How
these latter, spurious, eﬀects arise from misuse of the Lorentz transformation is also explained.

PACS 03.30.+p

The Lorentz transformation (LT) relates space-time coordinates (x,y,z,t) of an event
in one inertial frame, S, to those of the same event (x′,y′,z′,t′) in another inertial frame
S’. As is conventional, it is assumed that S’ moves with uniform velocity, v, along the
common x,x′ axis of the two frames.

In any actual experiment, the times t and t′ must be measured by clocks at rest in
S and S’ respectively. Consider a clock, C1, at rest in S’ at the origin of the x′-axis.
Events on the worldline of C1 in S’ then have coordinates (0,0,0,t′). This clock is now
observed from the frame S. The LT may be used to deﬁne the time-like invariant interval
relation [1]:

c2(∆τ )2 ≡ c2(∆t)2 − (∆x)2 = c2(∆t′)2 − (∆x′)2
(1)
where c is the speed of light in vacuum, and ∆t ≡ t1 − t2 etc. This equation relates
the coordinates of the events (x1,0,0,t1), (x2,0,0,t2) in S and (x′
2) in S’.
Considering two events on the worldline of C1, in virtue of the relations ∆x′ = 0 and
∆x = v∆t, Eqn(1) gives the time dilatation (TD) formula relating ∆t′, an apparent
time interval registered by C1, as viewed from S, to ∆t, the corresponding time interval
recorded by a clock, similar to C1, but at rest in S:

1,0,0,t′

2,0,0,t′

1), (x′

where:

Specifying the position of C1 in S as (x1,0,0,t1) where:

∆t = γ∆t′

γ ≡

p1 − (v/c)2

′
1 = 0,
x

x1 = vt1

1

(2)

(3)

it follows that x′

1 = x1 = 0 when t1 = 0. The LT

x′
1 = γ(x1 − vt1)
1 = γ(t1 − vx1
t′
c2 )

then requires that also t′
1 = x1 = t1 = 0. Application of the LT (4)
and (5) thus has the eﬀect of synchronising C1 with a clock on the frame S. After this
synchronisation, Eqn(2) may be written as:

1 = 0 when x′

t1 = γt′
1

t2 = γt′
2

Consider now a second clock, C2, also at rest in S’. Specifying its coordinates in S and
S’ as (X2,0,0,t2) and (0,0,0,t′
2), respectively, where X = x − L and X ′ = x′ − L′, and t2
is such that:

X ′

2 = 0, X2 = vt2

2 = X2 = 0 when t2 = t′
then X ′
x1 → X2 and x′
1 → X ′
formula for C2 is then:

2 = 0. That is the LT (4) and (5), with the replacements
2, is used to synchronise C2 with a local clock at rest in S. The TD

In (6) and (8) the times t1 and t2 are the times recorded by clocks identical to C1 and
C2 but at rest in S. Suppose now that C1 and C2 are identical and that the clocks at
rest in S have been previously synchronised, for example, by the exchange of light signals
as suggested by Einstein [3]. Then t1 = t2 ≡ t in (6) and (8).
It then follows that
1 = t′
t′
2 = t/γ. The apparent times of the moving clocks C1 and C2 are then the same for
all values of t –there is no ‘relativity of simultanteity’ (RS) eﬀect.

The space-like invariant interval ∆s12 between events on the world lines of C1 and C2

is deﬁned as:

(∆s12)2 ≡ (∆x12)2 − c2(∆t12)2 = (∆x′

(9)
where ∆t12 ≡ t1 − t2 etc and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the clocks C1 and C2
respectively. The spatial separation of C1 and C2 in S is the value of ∆x12 at any deﬁnite
instant in S, i.e. when t1 = t2 = t or ∆t12 = 0. It follows from (6) and (8) that at the
same instant t′

12 = 0. Thus (9) may be written as:

12)2 − c2(∆t′

2 = t′ or ∆t′

1 = t′

12)2

∆s12 = ∆x12(∆t12 = 0) = ∆x′

12(∆t′

12 = 0)

or

∆s12 = L = L′

Thus the spatial separation of the clocks is a Lorentz invariant quantity [2] –there is no
‘length contraction’ (LC).

As discussed in detail elesewhere, [4, 5] the spurious RS and LC eﬀects of conventional
special relativity are the result of an incorrect use of the space-time LT to analyse space
and time measurements. With arbitary clock synchronisation, the LT relating events in
the frames S and S’ is:

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(11)

(12)

(13)

x′ = γ[x − v(t − t0)]
0 = γ[t − t0 − vx
c2 ]

t′ − t′

The time oﬀsets t0 and t′
0 are speciﬁc to a particular clock and must be chosen in such a
way as to correctly describe the times registered by clocks at diﬀerent spatial locations [4,
5]. For the synchronised clocks C1 and C2 discussed above, t0 and t′
0 have values such
that for C1 the LT is:

while that for C2 is:

c2

The LT for C2 may also be written in terms of the coordinates x, x′ where C1 is at the
origin of the x′-axis:

The RS and LC eﬀects are generated if, for example, the LT appropriate to C1, (14)
and (15) is used for C2. by making the replacements: t = 0, x1 → x2, x′
2 = L
in these equations. This is what has, hitherto, been done, following Einstein [3], when
applying the LT to space-time measurements. Experiments have recently been proposed
to search for the existence (or not) of the RS eﬀect [6]. At the time of writing, there is
ample experimental veriﬁcation of TD but none of RS or LC [4].

1 → x′

Eqn(14) is identical to Eqns(3) and Eqn(16) is identical to Eqns(7). Using (14) to

eliminate x1 from (15) or (16) to eliminate X2 from (17) gives:

This is the time dilatation formula that is valid for all synchronised clocks in the frame
S’. Eqn(20) describes the only way in which the space-time geometry of special relativity
diﬀers from that of Galilean relativity. The equations (3) and (5) or (14) and (16),
describing the motion of the clocks in S and S’, are the same as in Galilean relativity.
Special relativity compels us to modify the Newtonian conception of time, but not that
of space.

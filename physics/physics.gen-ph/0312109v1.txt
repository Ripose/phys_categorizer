Abstract

Recent observations of Ultra High Energy Cosmic rays suggest a
small violation of Lorentz symmetry. Such a violation is expected in
schemes with discrete/quantized spacetime. We examine this situation
and suggest tests which could be carried out, for example by NASA’s
GLAST Satellite. The considerations are extrapolated to the large
scale cosmos.

1 Introduction

A noncommutative geometry arises if there is a minimum spacetime interval
that cannot be penetrated, as is well known, starting from the work of Snyder
and others [1, 2]. Later interest in such minimum intervals was aroused due
to, for example, lattice gauge theory [3], though it was a computational tool.
This apart these ideas were also studied independently by several authors
like Kadyshevskii, Wolf, Finkelstein, the author himself and others, though
in the context of diﬀering settings [4, 5, 6, 7]. Even more recently ’t Hooft
and others have re-examined lattice theories. This time the motivation has
been more on the lines of minimum spacetime intervals [8].
What happens in this case is there is a departure from Lorentz Symmetry
[7, 9]. Typically we have an energy momentum relation (with units such that
c = 1 = ¯h)

E2 = m2 + p2

l2p4

where l is a minimum length interval, which could be typically the Planck
length and more generally the Compton length, (which reduces to the Planck

alternative point of view, starting directly from the noncommutativity, or
the modiﬁed uncertainty principle which results from these considerations in
Quantum Gravity or Quantum Superstring theory, for example (cf.[10]and
references therein):

[x, p] = ¯h′ = ¯h[1 +

where we have temporarily re-introduced ¯h. (2) shows that eﬀectively ¯h is
replaced by ¯h′. So,

neglecting higher order terms in (3) is of the same form as (1).
We now examine a few implications of (1).

2 Modiﬁed Dispersion

Let us consider an eﬀect similar to the Compton eﬀect [11], but with (1)
replacing the usual energy momentum formula. Here if ~k0 is the incident
radiation and ~k is the scattered radiation at an angle θ, as in the usual
theory we get from the energy and momentum conservation laws,

The relations (6) or (7) enable us to observe the eﬀect of the violation of
Lorentz Symmetry as embodied in (1).

3 Particle Behaviour

Owing to (1) we have a modiﬁed Klein-Gordon equation

where D denotes the usual D’Alembertian.
Just to get a feel, it would be interesting to consider the extra eﬀect in (8).
For simplicity we take the one dimensional case. As in conventional theory
if we separate the space and time parts of the wave function we get

l2u(4) + u(2) + λu = 0,

λ = E2

m2 > 0

whence if in (9) we take,

From (10) it is easy to deduce that there are two extra solutions, as can be
anticipated by the fact taht (8) is a fourth order equation, unlike the usual
second order Klein-Gordon equation. Thus we have

What do the two extra solutions in (11) indicate? To see this we observe
that α is given by, from (11)

In other words (12) corresponds to waves with wavelength of the order l,
which is intuitively quite reasonable.
What is interesting is that if l is an absolute length then the extra eﬀect is
independent of the mass of the particle. In any case the solutions from (12)
are GZK violating solutions.
We now make some remarks. Departures from Lorentz symmetry of the type
given in (1) have been studied, though from a phenomenological point of
view [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. These arise mostly from an observation of ultra
high energy cosmic rays. Given Lorentz symmetry, there is the GZK cut oﬀ
such that particles above this cut oﬀ would not be able to travel cosmological
distances and reach the earth. However there are indications of a violation
of the GZK cut oﬀ.
In any case some of the eﬀects following, for example from (1), like (6) or
(7) can be detected, it is hoped by the GLAST Satellite to be launched by
NASA in 2006 or shortly thereafter.
l2 rather
Interestingly, if in (1) or (8) we take, purely on an ad hoc basis,
than +l2, we get two real exponential solution of (8). One of them is an
increasing exponential leading to very high probabilities for ﬁnding these
particles.

4 Scaled Fractality

We now extrapolate the minimum scale eﬀects to the large scale universe.
It has been known that there is a deep connection between a stochastic and
Brownian behaviour on the one hand and critical point phenomena and the
Renormalization Group on the other hand [18, 19]. Fractality itself is a
manifestation of resolution dependent measurements, while Renormalization
Group considerations arise due to coarse graining at diﬀerent resolutions. A
good example of the fractal behaviour is Quantum Mechanics itself which

4

has been shown to have the fractal dimension 2 [20].
In the above context, we will now argue that there is a manifestation of
what may be called “scaled” Quantum Mechanics, at diﬀerent scales in the
universe.
It has already been argued that in the universe at large, there appears to be
the analogues of the Planck constant at diﬀerent scales [21, 22]. Infact we
have

The size of the universe, the size of a supercluster etc. from equations like
(17)-(21), as described in the references turn up as the analogues of the
Compton wavelength. For example we have

One can see that equations (13) to (22) are a consequence of gravitational
orbits (or the Virial Theorem) and the conservation of angular momentum
viz.,

(Cf.refs.[21, 22]), where L, M, v represent typical length (or dispersion in
length), mass and velocities at that scale and H denotes the scaled Planck
constant.
It also appears that equations (17) to (21) resemble a typical Random Walk
relation (Cf.[23]) of Brownian motion.
All this is suggestive but empirical. The question arises whether there is any
theoretical justiﬁcation. To investigate this further we observe that if we use
(23) along with the relation,

L = vT

where T is a typical time scale, for example the time period for an orbit, we
get the relations

where ν is the diﬀusion constant, h the Planck constant and m the mass of
a typical particle.
We now observe that as is well known, the relations (24) or (25) lead to an
equation identical to the Quantum Mechanical Schrodinger equation (Cf.ref.[18]
for a detailed derivation)

(27)

which is the well known Uncertainty relation. Conversely, from the Uncer-
tainty principle we could get back (24) or (25).
Interestingly it has been shown that this is true, not just for the special form
of the diﬀusion constant, but also for any other form of the diﬀusion con-
stant [24]. Another interesting point is that starting from (24) or (13), we
can deduce equations like (17), which describe a Brownian path [25].
In any case the steps leading to equation (26) and (26) itself provide the
rationale for the scaled de Broglie or Compton lengths, for example equation
(22), which follow from (27).
All this can be linked to Critical Point Theory and the Renormalization
Group.For this, we observe that the creation of particles from a Quantum
vacuum (or pre space time) has been described in the references cited [26, 27].
It can be done within the context of the above Nelsonian Theory, in com-
plete analogy with the creation of Benard cells at the critical point. In this
development the Nelsonian-Brownian process as described in (25) deﬁnes,
ﬁrst the Planck length, the shortest possible length and then the random
process leads to the Compton scale (Cf.ref.[25]). This process is as noted
(Cf.ref.[27]) a complete analogue of the phase transition associated with the
Landau-Ginsburg equation [28]

The parallel is not yet fully apparent, if we compare (28) and the Schrodinger
equation (25). However this becomes clear if we consider how the Schrodinger
equation itself can be deduced from the amplitudes of the Quantum vacuum,
in which case we get

which can be easily reduced to the Compton wavelength. In other words,
the Schrodinger equation (26), via (29) describes the creation of particles, a
la Benard cells in a Landau-Ginsburg like phase transition.
As is known, the interesting aspects of the critical point theory (Cf.ref.[28])
are universality and scale. Broadly, this means that diverse physical phenom-
ena follow the same route at the critical point, on the one hand, and on the
other this can happen at diﬀerent scales, as exempliﬁed for example, by the
course graining techniques of the Renormalization Group. To highlight this
point we note that in critical point phenomena we have the reduced order
parameter ¯Q and the reduced correlation length ¯ξ. Near the critical point
we have relations like

This gives

which is nothing but (20).
In other words the scaled Planck eﬀects and the scaled Random Walk eﬀects
as typiﬁed by equations like (13)-(21) are the result of a critical point phase
transition and subsequent course graining.
1. We observe that a Schrodinger equation like procedure has been used
though in an empirical way by Agnese and Festa [29] to derive a Titius-Bode
type relation for planetary distances which now appear as quantized levels.
This consideration has been extended in an empirical way to also account for
quantized cosmic distances [30].
Interestingly if we consider a wave packet of the generalized Schrodinger
equation (26) with h1 given by (13) for the universe itself, we have for a
Gaussian wave packet

R is the spread of the wave packet. As R

σ

that is the “Compton wavelength” of the universe treated as a wave packet.
2. Interestingly we can pursue the reasoning of equations like (13) to the
case of terrestrial phenomena. Let us consider a gas at standard tempera-
1023 per cubic
ture and pressure. In this case, the number of molecules n

In this case, a simple application of the WKB approximation, leads im-

Similarly we can have the analogue of the mysterious Weinberg relation link-
ing the pion mass to the Hubble constant, from H 2 = M 3LG. For this we
need to deﬁne the analogue of the Hubble constant H

4. We have argued that just as matter in the form of elementary parti-
cles, forms or condenses within the Compton wavelength from a background
Quantum vaccuum in a phase transition, matter at other scales, for example
stars and galaxies also condenses or clusters by a similar mechanism. This
would give a rationale for the observed lumpyness of the universe. Similar
considerations apply for the other scales referred to.

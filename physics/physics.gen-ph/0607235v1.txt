Abstract

The interactions inside the (bisemi)particles and between them are of bilinear type
and are envisaged from two points of view:

The ﬁrst approach, based on the reducible representations of algebraic bilinear
semigroups, allows to describe explicitly the interactions between (bisemi)particles
by means of gravito-electro-magnetic ﬁelds of interaction while the second approach,
based on the consideration of (bi)connections, leads to Maxwell extended equations
involving the gravitational ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

As the elementary particles are considered in the algebraic quantum theory (AQT)
[Pie2], [Pie4] as being elementary bisemiparticles:

• having a twofold nature based on the product of a left semiparticle localized in
the upper half space by its symmetric right equivalent localized in the lower half
space

and

• characterized by a three level embedded internal space-time structure,

it is natural to envisage that the interactions inside the elementary (bisemi)particles and
between them are of bilinear type.

This contrasts obviously with the linear treatment of the interactions between
elementary particles considered in quantum ﬁeld theories and, especially, in gauge
theories, which is at the origin of the divergences encountered in these theories as
developed in this paper.

Einstein [Ein3] pointed out previously that “linear laws have solutions which satisfy
the superposition principle but they do not describe the interactions between elementary
particles”.

It will be shown that the bilinear interactions between left and right internal structures
of J elementary bisemiparticles can be judiciously described in the bilinear frame of the
global program of Langlands by the reducible representation of the algebraic general bi-
linear semigroup GL2J (Lv × Lv) of order 2J which provides the structure of the searched
interaction ﬁeld.

At this stage, it is important to notice:

• that the interactions in QFT are handled linearly by means of gauge the-
ories (dealing with the groups of transformations on the ﬁelds leaving invariant the
Lagrangian density) in the mathematical frame of the Erlanger program of
which studies have concerned the actions of the symmetry groups in geometry

• while the interactions in AQT are envisaged bilinearly throughout the func-
tional representations of the algebraic bilinear semigroups in the frame-
work of the Langlands global program [Pie3].

2

In this context, the internal structure of elementary bisemiparticles is recalled in chap-
ter 2 and it is proved that the interactions inside these are generated by (gravito)-electro-
magnetic ﬁelds.

for the corresponding magnetic moments;

3

b) the electric string ﬁelds at these levels “ST ”, “M G” and “M ” responsible

for the electric charges on these shells.

Remark that the value of the electric charge at the “ST ”, “MG” or “M” level is the
sum, over all sets of exchanged electric biquanta, of the pseudo-norms of the generators of
the corresponding Lie algebras.

It is also recalled that the interactions inside a (bisemi)photon at γ biquanta
are provided by the exchanges of magnetic biquanta generating magnetic subﬁelds
at the “ST ”, “MG” and “M” levels.

Finally, the internal structure of bisemibaryons is reviewed: it is characterized
by the existence of a left and right “core” time semiﬁeld (at the “ST ”, “MG” and
“M” levels) from which the “time” string semiﬁelds of the three left and right
semiquarks are generated in such a way that a left and a right semibaryon of a
given bisemibaryon interact at the “ST ”, “MG” and “M” levels by means of:

1) the electric charges and the magnetic moments of the three bisemiquarks;

2) a gravito-electro-magnetic ﬁeld resulting from the bilinear interactions

between the left and right semiquarks of diﬀerent bisemiquarks;

3) a strong gravitational and electric ﬁeld resulting from the bilinear interac-
tions between the central core structures of the left and right semibaryons
and, respectively, the right and left semiquarks.

Chapter 3 is devoted to the study of the bilinear interactions between bisemiparticles
according to two points of view. The ﬁrst approach, based on the reducible representa-
tion of the algebraic bilinear semigroup GL2J (Lv × Lv), allows to describe explicitly the
interactions between “J” bisemiparticles by means of gravito-electro-magnetic ﬁelds of in-
teraction while the second approach, based on the consideration of (bi)connections, leads
to Maxwell extended equations in a bilinear mathematical frame.

More precisely, the (operator valued) string ﬁelds at the “ST ”, “MG” or “M” level,

of a set of J interacting bisemiparticles are given in the ﬁrst approach by:

b) in the case of (bisemi)photons: of gravitational and magnetic nature (section 3.5),

These interaction ﬁelds are:

3.4),

c) in the case of (bisemi)baryons: of

1) strong gravitational nature between right and left diﬀerent central cores,

2) gravitational, electric and magnetic nature between right and left diﬀerent semi-

quarks,

3) strong gravitational and electric nature between right (resp.

left) core time

structures and left (resp. right) semiquarks (sections 3.6 to 3.8).

In the second approach at the “M” level, the mass bioperator (M R ⊗ M L), acting
on every mass bisection or bistring of an elementary bisemifermion and endowed with
the inﬁnitesimal biconnection ((e)AR ⊗ (e)AL), develops according to:

((M R + AR) ⊗ (M L + AL)) = (M R ⊗ M L) + (AR ⊗ AL) + [(M R ⊗ AL) + (AR ⊗ M L)]

where [(M R ⊗ AL) + (AR ⊗ M L)] is the gravito-electro-magnetic interaction
ﬁeld operator of which tensorial form is the M Amn symmetric gravito-electro-
magnetic tensor corresponding to the F mn antisymmetric tensor of electro-magnetism.
So, the introduction of bilinearity in AQT gives rise to the gravito-electro-magnetism
leading to a powerful uniﬁcation of gravitation with electromagnetism, as hoped
by A. Einstein.

In this new context, the condition of 4D-null divergence ∂nM Amn = 0 applied to
the GEM tensor M Amn leads to a pair of GEM (gravito-electro-magnetic) diﬀerential

equations which describe not more, as in the Maxwell equations, the ﬂux of

in time of the time gravitational ﬁeld Gt and of the ﬂux of the space gravitational ﬁeld G
through the loop.

E ) or the circulation of

∇ (cid:5) −→
−→

In chapter 4, the Feynman paths relative to all kinds of gravito-electro-magnetic
interactions in AQT are reinterpreted on the basis of the following considerations:

5

a) The exchange of gravitational biquanta, responsible for the gravitational force,
is considered on an equal footing as the exchange of electro-magnetic biquanta cor-
responding to the virtual photons of QED.

b) The interactions between ﬁelds are not realized in AQT at a fundamental level

by perturbative series.

c) The transition amplitudes of the Feynmann paths in QFT become transition in-

tensities in AQT due to the bilinear character of this theory.

As each “ST ”, “MG” or “M” (operator-valued) ﬁeld of space or time is given in AQT
by the (sum of the) set of products, right by left, of its sections which are strings, the only
basic diagrams of interaction are those involving exchanges of gravitational, electric
and magnetic biquanta between left and right strings: they correspond to the ﬁrst
order diagrams of Feynmann.

In the philosophy of AQT, the left and right strings are one-dimensional waves, homo-

topic to circles S1, having two senses of rotation, in such a way that:

a) the Feynmann path intervals are reinterpreted as arcs of circles measured

by angles of rotation,

b) the left (resp. right) Green’s propagator or a left (resp. right) string is given by
the one parameter group of diﬀeomorphisms shifting each point of the string
by a small interval (of arc).

c) the diﬀerent paths from a point A to a point B correspond to the possible

normal modes of the exchanged biquanta.

In consequence, AQT is a mathematical theory exempt of divergences: for exam-
ple, the famous self-energy diagram in QFT is then replaced by a diagram involving the
exchange of one magnetic biquantum inside a bistring.

2 Internal gravito-electromagnetic interactions of

6

(elementary) particles

The aim of this chapter consists in:

a) recalling what is the internal structure of the elementary particles which are
described in the present context as bisemiparticles, a bisemiparticle being given by
the product of a left semiparticle localized in the upper half space by its symmetric
right equivalent localized in the lower half space.

b) showing that an elementary bisemiparticle sticks together by means of the bilin-
ear (gravito)-electro-magnetic ﬁelds of interaction between its right and left
components.

2.1 The classiﬁcation of particles in AQT

The classiﬁcation of elementary (bisemi)particles adopted in this algebraic quantum theory
corresponds to the standard classiﬁcation used in quantum ﬁeld theories, excepts perhaps
with regard to some gauge bosons of the non abelian gauge ﬁeld theories (since AQT is
not essentially a gauge theory but “covers” in some way the gauge ﬁelds theories).

In this respect, the elementary (bisemi)fermions are:

• the leptons e−, µ−, τ − and their neutrinos;

• the quarks u+, d−, s−, c+, b−, t+;

and the elementary (bisemi)bosons are:

• the photons;

• the gravitational, electronic and magnetic (bisemi)bosons.

The hadrons have to be added to this list, although they are not essentially elementary
since they are composed from a set of three quarks ion the case of baryons and of two quarks
in the case of mesons.

First of all, the space-time structure of the elementary bisemifermions e−, u+ and

d− of the ﬁrst family will be recalled.

7

In order to take into account the main features of quantum ﬁeld theories [Pie4], it was
assumed that the mass shell of an elementary bisemifermion could be generated from
its most internal space-time structure interpreted as its internal vacuum structure.

2.2 The space-time vacuum structure of e−, u+ and d−

STR ⊗ M S

• The internal space structure (M S

STL) of the vacuum of an elementary bisemi-
fermion is generated from the corresponding vacuum time structure (M T

M T
) which is given [Pie5] by the representation space Repsp(GL2(Lv × Lv)t) of
the bilinear algebraic semigroup GL2(Lv × Lv)t over the product (Lv × Lv) of
the sets of completions [B-T], [Che], [Har], [Lan], [Ser]

STR

Lv = {Lv1, . . . , Lvµ,mµ , . . . , Lvq,mq }

and Lv = {Lv1, . . . , Lvµ,mµ , . . . , Lvq,mq } .

• The set of equivalent completions {Lvµ,mµ }mµ (resp. {Lvµ,mµ }mµ ) of the µ-th real
place vµ (resp. vµ ), 1 ≤ µ ≤ q, is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of
real pseudo-ramiﬁed algebraic extensions {Fvµ,mµ }mµ (resp. {Fvµ,mµ }mµ ) of a global
number ﬁeld K of characteristic 0 and is characterized by a rank

[Lvµ,mµ : K] ≡ [Lvµ,mµ : K] = ∗ + µ (cid:5) N

equal to the Galois extension degree of Fvµ,mµ (resp. Fvµ,mµ )

in such a way that [Lvµ,mµ : K] is an integer modulo N where ∗ denotes an integer
inferior to N.

The integer N is the Galois extension degree of the irreducible algebraic closed
subsets interpreted as time quanta.

• The (µ, mµ)-th conjugacy class representative GL2(Lvµ,mµ ×Lvµ,mµ )t of GL2(Lv ×Lv)t
has for representation the GL2(Lvµ,mµ ×Lvµ,mµ )-subbisemimodule (MLvµ,mµ
⊗MLvµ,mµ )
which is such that MLvµ,mµ
rotates in opposite sense with respect to its symmetric
component MLvµ,mµ in the corresponding Lie algebra representative gℓ2(Lvµ,mµ ×
Lvµ,mµ ).
The set of conjugacy class representatives of GL2(Lv × Lv)t can be set up
into a tower [G-D], [Bour], [Weil]:

GL2(Lv1 × Lv1) ⊂ · · · ⊂ GL2(Lvµ,mµ × Lvµ,mµ ) ⊂ · · · ⊂ GL2(Lvq,mq × Lvq,mq )

of which components are characterized by increasing ranks.

The internal vacuum “ST ” structure of an elementary (bisemi)fermion e−, u+ or d− is
characterized by:

b) the sets of ranks of these bisections associated with the numbers of biquanta on these.

• It was seen in [Pie2] and in [Pie4] that the time and space string ﬁelds of the internal
vacuum “ST ” structure of an elementary bisemifermion were submitted to strong
ﬂuctuations generating on their sections degenerate singularities which are able to
produce by versal deformations and blowups of these two new covering string ﬁelds:

2.10 Generation of bisemifermions of the 2-th and 3-th family

• From section 2.2, the internal space-time structure of the elementary bisemifermions

e−, u+ and d− of the ﬁrst family was analyzed.

It is the aim of this section to recall how the internal structure of the massive leptons
and quarks of the second and of the third families can be generated from the internal
structure of the corresponding leptons and quarks of the ﬁrst family.

of an elementary bisemifermion “A” of the ﬁrst family (i.e. A = e−, u+ or d−), in
a strong external ﬁeld, could generate, by versal deformations and spreading-out of
singularities of codimension 2 on all of its bisections (or bistrings), the “ST ”, “MG”
and “M” string ﬁelds (B
STL−M GL−ML) of a bisemifermion
“B” of the second family (i.e. B = µ−, s− or c+) by endowing the string ﬁelds
of “A” with additional string ﬁelds “A′” leading to the transformation:

resentation corresponding to an equivalence class of lift at the “ST ”, “MG”
and “M” levels sending the bisemiphoton at “γ” biquanta into a bisemiphoton at
“(γ + δ)” biquanta.

• The inverse transformation can also be envisaged in such a way that a bisemiphoton

at (γ + δ) biquanta can split into two bisemiphotons at “γ” and “δ” biquanta.

The frame of the Bose-Einstein statistics is then reached for (bisemi)photons
since they can join together “on the same level”.

• Remark that a set of “β” magnetic biquanta, β ≤ γ, at the “ST ”, “MG” and

“(γ − β)” magnetic biquanta: they thus obey the Bose-Einstein statistics.

• Similarly, a set of exchanged electric biquanta is an electric (bisemi)boson.

2.12 Proposition

1) The (bisemi)photons and the sets of magnetic and electric exchange biquanta are

(bisemi)bosons, obeying the Bose-Einstein statistics.

2) The elementary (bisemi)fermions obey the Fermi-Dirac statistics.

Proof.

• Part 1) was already proved in section 2.11.

• Part 2) results simply from the fact that two bisemifermions at “ordinary” ener-
gies (for example two (bisemi)electrons) cannot amalgamate because there is an
obstruction due to their electric charges generating an electric ﬁeld between
their left (resp.
left) “space”
string semiﬁelds throughout the emergence point, i.e. the origin of the considered
bisemifermion.

Introducing composite bisemiparticles

Since the beginning of this chapter, the space-time internal structure of the elementary
bisemifermions and bisemibosons has been reviewed. It is now the aim of the rest of this
chapter to recall the internal structure of composite bisemifermions, i.e. (bisemi)baryons,
and composite “strong” bisemibosons, i.e. mesons, as developed in [Pie2].

2.16 Corollary

At the “ST ”, “MG” and “M” levels, a right and a left semibaryon of a given
bisemibaryon interact by means of :

a) the electric charges and the magnetic moments of the 3 (bisemi)quarks.

b) a gravito-electro-magnetic ﬁeld resulting from the bilinear interactions between the

right and the left semiquarks of diﬀerent bisemiquarks.

c) a strong gravitational and electric ﬁeld resulting from the bilinear interactions between
the central core structures of the left and right semibaryons and, respectively, the right
and left semiquarks.

3 Gravito-electro-magnetic ﬁelds of interaction

In this chapter, the interactions between a set of bisemiparticles are taken up from two
points of view:

A) The ﬁrst approach is explicit in the sense that the interactions between
bisemiparticles are considered in the bilinear frame of the global program
of Langlands based on the reducible representation (space) Repsp GL2J (LV × LV )
of the general algebraic bilinear semigroup GL2J (LV × LV ) of order 2J .

This allows to describe explicitly the gravito-electro-magnetic ﬁelds of interaction
between “ J ” interacting bisemiparticles.

B) The second approach, which is more explicit, is based on the study of
biconnections leading to Maxwell equations in a more general bilinear mathematical
frame which allows to introduce in these the gravitational ﬁeld(s): this approach was
extensively developed in the algebraic quantum theory (AQT) [Pie2] to which we
refer.

A) Explicit description of the interaction ﬁelds of a set of inter-
acting bisemiparticles

3.1 The (operator valued) string ﬁelds of a set of “ J ” interact-

ing bisemiparticles

• Assume that we have a set of “ J ” interacting bisemiparticles. The “time” ﬁeld of
their “ ST ” level is given by a bisemisheaf of diﬀerentiable functions on the non-
orthogonal completely reducible representation space Repsp GL2J (LV × LV ) of the
bilinear general semigroup GL2J (LV ×LV ) where LV (resp. LV ) is the sum of the left
(resp. right) completions referring to the considered left (resp. right) semiparticles.

• According to [Pie3], the completely reducible non-orthogonal representation

space of GL2J(LV × LV ) decomposes as follows:

Repsp(GL2J (LV × LV )) ≡ Repsp GL2J

in such a way that:

1) M T

STR(i) ⊗ M T

STL(i) ≡ Repsp(GL2i(Lvi × Lvi )) is the “time” ﬁeld (i.e. structure)

of the “ ST ” level of the i-th bisemiparticle;

2) M T

STR(i)⊗M T

STL(j) ≡ Repsp(T t

2i(Lvi)×T2j (Lvj )) is the “time” interaction ﬁeld(s)
at the “ ST ” level between the i-th right semiparticle and the j-th left semi-
particle;

if we take into account the Gauss bilinear decomposition:

GL2i(Lvi × Lvi) = T t

2i(Lvi) × T2i(Lvi)

of the bilinear algebraic semigroup of order 2 over the product (Lvi × Lvi) of the sets
of completions:

Lvi = {Lvi1
and Lvi = {Lvi1

, . . . , Lviµ,mµ
, . . . , Lviµ,mµ

, . . . , Lviq,mq
, . . . , Lviq,mq

}

} .

• Referring to section 2.2, the (γtR×L→rR×L ◦ ER×L) morphisms transform the “time”
ﬁelds into reduced “time” ﬁelds and complementary “space” ﬁelds according to:

tR×L→rR×L ◦ E(i)
γ(i)

R×L : M T

STR(i) ⊗ M T

STL(i) −−−→ M T −S

STR (i) ⊗ M T −S

• The (operator-valued) string ﬁeld at the “ ST ” level corresponding to
STL (i)) of the i-th bisemiparticle is

consists in considering that one of these bisemiparticles is submitted to the global
inﬂuence of the bilinear external ﬁeld (operator (AR × AL) ) of the subset of the
(J − 1) remaining “external” bisemiparticles in such a way that every (µ, mµ)-th
“space” bisection of the “ M ” level (as for the “ ST ” and “ MG ” levels) of this
considered bisemiparticle can join “ k ” external biquanta transforming it under the

Remark that this transformation corresponds in quantum (ﬁeld) theory to the in-
variance of the wave function under a phase factor.

• If,

instead of envisaging an (operator-valued) bisection (or bistring) of “space”,
we take into account an (operator-valued) bisection of “space-time” (see section
2.3), then the external ﬁeld operator to be considered is the generic biconnection
(AR(t, r) ⊗ AL(t, r)) where AL(t, r) (resp. AR(t, r) ) is a left (resp. right) connec-
tion acting on a left (resp. right) time space string and being a left (resp. right)
distribution at each left (resp. right) point of it.

where [(M R ⊗ AL) + (AR ⊗ M L)] is the gravito-electro-magnetic interaction

2) The symmetric GEM tensor M Amn is transformed into the antisymmetric tensor
Fmn of electromagnetism if M Amn is submitted to the bijective antisymmetric map
C : M Amn → Fmn transforming the right components Am into their corresponding
left components and the left components M n into their corresponding right compo-
nents.

Proof.

• The gravito-electro-magnetic interaction ﬁeld operator GEM as well as its one-to-
one correspondence with the antisymmetric tensor Fmn of electromagnetism was
introduced and proved in [Pie2].

considered elementary bisemifermion (see proposition 2.9).

• The antisymmetric one-to-one correspondence C : M Amn → Fmn transforms {E−

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

• Let us remark that the novelty of the symmetric tensor M Amn with respect to
the antisymmetric tensor Fmn of electromagnetism is the existence of diagonal
components

Gt ≃ m0 At + At m0

and Gi ≃ pi Ai + Ai pi

which belong respectively to a scalar “time” gravitational ﬁeld and a “ 3D-
space” gravitational ﬁeld diagonal tensor.

Under the antisymmetric map C , these gravitational components become null.

The “ GEM ” gravito-electro-magnetic tensor M Amn is reduced to the “ GM ” gravito-
magnetic tensor M Ap

ton interacts with an external ﬁeld.

• but, in function of the variation in time of the time gravitational Gt
and of the ﬂux of the space gravitational ﬁeld G through the loop.

This allows to unify the electromagnetism of Maxwell with the gravita-
tion as hoped by A. Einstein [Ein1].

Proof.

• When the second set of the Maxwell equations describes the magneto-electrodynamics
in function of the electric charge density and the electric current, GEM diﬀerential
equations give an explanation of how the gravito-magneto-electrodynamics
works: this gives theoretically the possibility of generating a 1D and 3D
gravitational ﬁeld respectively from an electric ﬁeld and from an electromagnetic
ﬁeld (or vice-versa).

• Remark that a gravitational ﬁeld is only generated if the “added” “ k ” biquanta
proceeding from the external ﬁelds are not connected to the considered bisemiparticle
as resulting from the developments of section 3.9.

• Finally, the conditions of 4D-null divergence ∂nM Amn = 0 of the GEM tensor
M Amn leads to the conditions (∂L, AL) = (∂L, M L) = 0 , where ∂L is a 4D-(left-)
divergence and (•, •) is a scalar product.

Now, (∂L, AL) = 0 corresponds to the radiation gauge or to the Lorentz condition
of electro-magnetism while (∂L, M L) = 0 is a condition of conservation of the left
mass of the reference left semiparticle or is a condition of uniform (non accelerated)
motion.

4 The Feynman paths in AQT

Taking into account the new way of considering the (bilinear) interactions between (bisemi)-
particles [Pie1] as developed in chapters 2 and 3, the Feynman paths will be adjusted and
reinterpreted in this chapter at the light of the developments of string theory and quantum
ﬁeld theory.

4.1 Three kinds of gravito-electro-magnetic bilinear interactions

Let us outline that three kinds of bilinear interactions at the “ ST ”, “ M G ”
and “ M ” levels have been envisaged:

1) Internal explicit of (gravito-)electro-magnetic type allowing to join the left

and right semiparticles of a given bisemiparticle.

More concretely:

sition 2.8).

• a bisemifermion is tied by means of an internal electro-magnetic ﬁeld (see propo-

• a bisemiphoton holds together by a magnetic subﬁeld (see proposition 2.11).

• a bisemibaryon is stuck by means of the internal electro-magnetic subﬁelds of
the bisemiquarks, the gravito-electro-magnetic subﬁelds of interaction between
the left and right semiquarks of the diﬀerent bisemiquarks and, ﬁnally, by the
mixed “strong” gravitational and electric subﬁelds of interaction between the
core central time structures of the left and right semibaryons and, respectively,
the right and left semiquarks (see proposition 2.15).

2) External explicit of gravito-electro-magnetic type allowing to describe the
bilinear interactions between a set of “ J ” interacting bisemiparticles by means of
gravito-electro-magnetic subﬁelds between left and right semiparticles belonging to
diﬀerent bisemiparticles (see proposition 3.8).

3) External implicit by means of inﬁnitesimal biconnections allowing the in-
troduction of a gravito-electro-magnetic interaction ﬁeld tensor in one-to-one corre-
spondence with the antisymmetric tensor of Maxwell.

These three kinds of bilinear interactions are of gravito-electro-magnetic type and are
produced by the exchange of gravitational, electric and magnetic biquanta, the exchanged

40

bisemibosons generating gravito-electro-magnetic forces between right and left semiparti-
cles.

The exchange of electro-magnetic bisemibosons, transferring momenta, is re-
sponsible for the Coulomb force and these electro-magnetic bisemibosons are the
virtual photons of electrodynamics.

What is new in this algebraic quantum theory is that the exchange of gravitational
biquanta, responsible for the gravitational force, is also considered on an equal
footing as the exchange of electro-magnetic biquanta.

4.2 The Feynman paths and the perturbative series in QFT

In QFT, the Feynman paths describe, among other things, the exchange of virtual photons
by studying functional integrals

F (φ) e− i

~ S(φ) Dφ

ZMap(Σ,M )

where:

• φ is a map from a space-time manifold “ Σ” into a target space “ M ”, which may

be R : so, Map(Σ, M) may be considered as a Hilbert space.

• Dφ is a product of local measures on “ M ”.

• F (φ) is a functional of φ and S(φ) the corresponding action.

Such a functional integral may be given by the correlation function depending on a

sequence {xi}n

i=1 of points in Σ [Gaw2], [Ben], [Bou]:

hφ(x1) . . . φ(xn)i =

Map(Σ,M ) φ(x1) . . . φ(xn) e−S(φ) Dφ
Map(Σ,M ) e−S(φ) Dφ
R
R

.

These functional integrals appear when the S-matrix is calculated by perturbative

techniques introduced by Feynman, Schwinger and Tomonaga.

A uniﬁed approach of these perturbative techniques was proposed by Dyson as a time

dependent perturbation theory which can be succintly introduced as follows [Dys]:

Consider the diﬀerential equation

i ~ c

∂ψ(σ)
∂σ

= V (σ) ψ(σ)

where:

41

• V (σ) is the time dependent interaction potential of interacting ﬁelds;

• ψ(σ) = U(σ, σ0) ψ0 is deﬁned over a family σ0, σ1, . . . of surfaces.

The operator U (σ, σ0), satisfying the diﬀerential equation

i ~ c

∂U(σ, σ0)
∂σ

= V (σ) U(σ, σ0) ,

can be put in the form

U(σ, σ0) =

1 −

V (t) dt

×

1 −

V (t) dt

× . . .

Z
which, expanded in ascending powers of V (and of ~ ) gives:

The V (ti) , 1 ≤ i ≤ n ≤ ∞ , thus are scattering potentials due to the presence of “ n ”
external particles or “ n ” external sets of particles and the form

U(σ, σ0) =

1 −

V (t) dt

×

1 −

V (t) dt

(cid:19)
of U(σ, σ0) is directly related to the fact that the free ﬁeld is expressed as a(n) (anti)-
symmetric product of the individual ﬁelds.

We can thus say that the perturbative series in QFT arise as a consequence of

the development of the free ﬁelds in products of the individual ﬁelds.

4.3 The interactions in AQT are not worked out perturbatively

When QFT works linearly at a fundamental level with amplitudes [Fey1], the algebraic
quantum theory (AQT), being a bilinear theory, works bilinearly with intensities by means
of representations of bilinear (algebraic) semigroups [Pie2], [Pie3].

42

(cid:19)

So, in AQT, a set of “ J ” non interacting ﬁelds (i.e. free ﬁelds) at the “space” “mass”

level is given according to section 3.1 and proposition 3.2 by:

FRepsp(GL2J (LV × LV )) =

(FRepsp T t

(cid:17)

J

(cid:18)

where FRepsp((cid:5)) is a functional representation space.

It thus appears clearly that the mass free ﬁeld is given by the sum, over the “ J ”
MR(i) by the

considered bisemiparticles, of the tensor products of the right semiﬁelds M Sp
left semiﬁelds M Sp

ML(i) .

As a consequence, the interaction between ﬁelds cannot be expressed in AQT
at a fundamental level by perturbative series on the contrary of what is done
in QFT.

All that is contained in the following proposition.

4.4 Proposition

The interactions between ﬁelds are not realized in AQT at a fundamental level by pertur-
bative series.

Proof.
Indeed, AQT, being a bilinear theory, works at a fundamental level with inten-
sities. This results from the fact that the free ﬁelds are given in AQT by the reducible
orthogonal functional representation space FRepsp GL2J (LV ×LV ) of the bilinear algebraic
semigroup GL2J (LV × LV ) while the interaction ﬁelds are expressed as the reducible non
orthogonal functional representation space of the same bilinear algebraic semigroup.

Consequently, the interactions between ﬁelds are not realized in a perturbative way as

it was justiﬁed in section 4.3.

4.5 Transitions amplitudes of the Feynman paths

• On the other hand, each “ ST ”, “ MG ” or “ M ” (operator-valued) ﬁeld of space
or time in AQT is given by (the sum of) the set of the products, right by left, of its

43

sections, which are strings characterized by their increasing ranks [Lvµ,mµ : K] ≃ µ(cid:5)N
or “Fourier” modes “ µ ”.

Each bisection of normal (or “Fourier”) mode “ µ ” is then a bistring behaving like
a harmonic oscillator.

We are thus led to study the interactions at the level of the strings in the
philosophy of the Feynman paths in a non perturbative way.

• If we refer now to the transition amplitude obtained in QFT for a single point
particle traveling from a point “ x ” to a point “ x′ ” of a Riemannian manifold M ,
we know that it is expressible in terms of the sum of all paths joining x to x′
[D’Ho], [Wein]:

S(x′; x) = Σ
paths
x→x′

e−S[path] .

• This transition amplitude S(x′; x) can be worked out by considering the evolution
in time of the (non relativistic) wave function ψ(x, t) of the point particle
as given by:

ψ(x′, t′) = i

d3x G(x′, t′; x, t) ψ(x, t) ,

x, x′ ∈ R 3 ,

t′ > t ,

where:

Z

– G(x′, t′; x, t) is the Green’s propagator;

– ψ(x′, t′) is in fact a wave [B-J] depending on the interval [(x′ − x), (t′ − t)] .

4.6 Feynman path intervals for bistrings

• In the philosophy of AQT, the left and right strings are one-dimensional waves,
homotopic to circles S1 and characterized by two senses of rotation according to
section 2.3.

Referring to the evolution in time of the wave function at a point particle, we can
easily state that:

1) The one-dimensional string waves of AQT have an evolution in time

which depends:

a) either on the intervals [(x′ − x), (t′ − t)], where x, x′ ∈ R 1 ,

44

b) or on a transition from a normal mode µ (at µ quanta) at “ x ” to a normal

mode ν (at ν quanta) at “ x′ ” .

2) As the string waves rotate, the path intervals [x′(t) − x(t)] of these correspond

in fact to rotations of some angles of these strings.

So, the Feynman path intervals in AQT are fundamentally arcs of
circles measured by angles of rotation of the considered string waves which
are rotated by Green’s propagators.

• But, as the string ﬁelds of AQT are composed of bistrings of which left and right
strings do not have necessarily the same rotational velocity, exchanges of mag-
netic quanta occur between them provoking a global movement of translation of
the bistrings as developed in [Pie2].

So, a left and a right string of a given bistring give rise theoretically to two
adjacent world sheets covering possibly each other partially. But, the world sheets
[H-S-V], [G-S], [Moo], [Poly] of string theory [Gid], [Pol1], [Pol2], [Joh], [Del→Wit]
(as well as the world-lines of point particles) have a continuous character, which
is not necessarily the case in the context of AQT, since the associated left and
right strings exchange “discontinuously” (magnetic) quanta, allowing them
to interact.

As a consequence, the normal “Fourier” modes of the left and right strings
of a given bistring change during their evolution in time, and, thus, it does not
seem realistic to envisage the world sheet of a string at a given normal mode “ µ ” .

The only basic diagrams of interaction in AQT are those involving exchanges of gravita-
tional, electric and magnetic biquanta between left and right strings (or sets of strings):
they correspond to the ﬁrst order diagrams of Feynman.

4.7 Proposition

Proof.

• As the internal structure of the elementary bisemiparticles is composed of “space”
and “time” ﬁelds at the “ ST ”, “ MG ” and “ M ” levels and as these ﬁelds are
composed of bistrings, the basic diagrams of interaction in AQT are those involving
left and right strings (or sets of strings).

45

• As AQT is fundamentally a non perturbative theory of interaction, the only basic
diagrams are those involving left and right strings (or sets of strings) exchanging
gravitational, electric and magnetic biquanta as it was developed in chapter 2 and 3.

The corresponding diagrams of Feynman are those of ﬁrst order of quantum electro-
dynamics implying the exchange of virtual photons [Fey2].

• These diagrams describe the (inverse) rotations of left and right strings in such a
way that the covered arcs of circles imply corresponding translations of the bistrings
as recalled in section 4.6.

4.8 The basic diagrams of AQT

These can be classiﬁed in three categories corresponding to the three kinds of bilinear
interactions described in section 4.1.

They are:

1) Internal explicit diagrams

a) of magnetic type involving pairs of left and right strings belonging to the
internal ﬁelds “ ST ”, “ MG ” and “ M ” of “space” (or “time”) of the elemen-
tary bisemifermions and describing the exchanges of internal magnetic
biquanta “inside” these bistrings.

b) of electric type involving pairs of space (resp. time) left strings and time (resp.
space) right strings belonging respectively to the internal space (resp. time) left
semiﬁelds and to the internal time (resp. space) right semiﬁelds “ ST ”, “ MG ”
and “ M ” of the elementary bisemifermions and describing the exchange of
internal electric biquanta, responsible for the electric charge at these levels
“ ST ”, “ MG ” and “ M ”.

c) of gravitational type

i. involving pairs of left and right strings belonging respectively to left and
right semiﬁelds “ ST ”, “ MG ” and “ M ” of left and right semiquarks
of diﬀerent bisemiquarks of bisemibaryons and describing the ex-
changes of gravitational biquanta between these pairs of strings.

ii. involving pairs of left and right strings belonging respectively to the left
and right “time” semiﬁelds “ ST ”, “ MG ” and “ M ” of semiquarks and

46

of core central “time” semistructures of semibaryons and describing the
exchanges of “strong” gravitational biquanta inside bisemibaryons.

2) External explicit diagrams of magnetic, electric and gravitational types as
in 1) except that the envisaged pairs of left and right strings are such that the left
(resp. right) and right (resp. left) strings belong to the semiﬁelds “ ST ”, “ MG ”
and “ M ” of two diﬀerent (elementary) bisemiparticles.

3) External implicit diagrams of magnetic, electric and gravitational types as
in 2) by means of inﬁnitesimal biconnections implying that the left or right strings
of the considered pairs of strings are now acted by the left or right external vector
potentials AL or AR and result from deformations as developed in section 3.9.

• So, the internal explicit diagrams refer to the exchanges of gravito-electro-

magnetic biquanta inside elementary bisemiparticles.

• While the external explicit and implicit diagrams describe the exchanges of gravito-
electro-magnetic biquanta between diﬀerent bisemiparticles allowing them
to interact.

4.9 Bistrings in the diagrams of AQT

The basic diagrams in AQT involve products of right strings by left strings of
the types:

ΦS

Rµ(xR) ⊗ ΦS
Lµ(xL) (resp. ΦS
where the left (resp. right) string ΦS
Rµ(xR) ), being the condensed notation
of ΦS
R(MLvµ,mµ
) ) envisaged in section 2.4, will be written in the
automorphic representation (see [Pie4]) of the bilinear algebraic semigroup
GL2(Lv × Lv) according to:

L(MLvµ,mµ ) (resp. ΦS

Lµ(xL)

φS
Lµ(xL) = cµ e2πiµxL

(resp. φS

Rµ(xR) = cµ e−2πiµxR ) .

µ ) of the string φS

counterclockwise (resp. clockwise).
The amplitudes cµ and c∗

annihilation operators that they have in QFT.

Lµ(xL) (resp. φS
Rµ(xR) ) is (ap-
µ e−2πiµxR ) at µ quanta rotating

µ thus do not have in AQT the interpretation of creation an

47

Indeed, the creation and annihilation operators are given in AQT by deformations
and inverse deformations of Galois type [Maz] of strings based respectively on Galois
automorphisms or antiautomorphisms as it was developed in [Pie2] and in [Pie4] (see
quantization rules).

4.10 Proposition

The left (resp. right) Green’s propagator of a left (resp. right) string is given
by the one-parameter group of diﬀeomorphisms {g∆xL
R } ) shifting
each point xL (resp. xR ) of the string by a (small) interval (of arc) ∆xL (resp. ∆xR ) .

Proof.

• Indeed, the action of the one-parameter group of diﬀeomorphisms {gxL

L } (resp. {gxR

R } )

on the left (resp. right) string φS

Lµ(xL) (resp. φS

Rµ(xR) ) is a homomorphism:

{gxL

from an initial state “ i ” to a ﬁnal state “ f ”;

Rµ(xR) and φS

– the lower and upper horizontal lines represent respectively the exchange from
“left to right” and from “right to left” of k magnetic, electric or gravitational

∆x1R and ∆x1L .

• As φS

Rµ(xR) rotates in the opposite sense with respect to φS

Lµ(xL) , we recover the
evolutionary interpretation of particles and antiparticles of the diagrams of Feynman.

• The exchanges of k biquanta between the left and right strings result from the action

of a (bi)potential on these as it will be shown in the following.

ments of left and right “space” strings (at the “ ST ”, “ MG ” and “ M ” levels)
interacting by means of magnetic subﬁelds by the exchanges of magnetic biquanta.

• Let (φS

of magnetic biquanta.

4.13 The context of the exchange of magnetic biquanta into a

bistring

• If the bistring (φS

Rµ(xR) ⊗D φS

Lµ(xL)) does no more rotate freely, then, it can be
submitted to the magnetic biendomorphism (ERµ ⊗mELµ ) considered in section
2.4 and transforming it into:

Rµ(x1R) ⊗ φS

Lµ(x1L)) = (φS

interval of time ∆t1 transforms it into the “diagonal” bistring

Rµ(x1R) ⊗ φS

• On the other hand, if we refer to the diﬀerential wave equation of the bisemiphoton in
a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate frame as envisaged in chapter 4 of [Pie2],
we see that a left and right unitary inner automorphisms transform this equation
into the 1D-degenerate second order diﬀerential equation of the harmonic oscillator
which is that of the bistring (φS

Rµ(xR) ⊗D φS

Lµ(xL)) .

It then results that there is a one-to-one correspondence between a bisemipho-

done for the magnetic case. But, the bistring to be considered is then of the type

Rµ(tR) ⊗ φS
φT

Lκ(xL)

(or φS

Rκ(xR) ⊗ φT

Lµ(tL) )

i.e. given by the product of a right “time” string at µ quanta by a left “space” string
at κ quanta (or by the product of a right “space” string at κ quanta by a left “time”
string at µ quanta).

• This bistring is rotating in the corresponding Lie bialgebra and is given there by
the operator valued bistring φTp

4.16 Remarks of the Feynman paths in AQT and QFT

1) The other diagrams considered in section 4.8 can be handled similarly. They are
of the same type and describe the exchanges of gravitational, electric and magnetic
biquanta.

2) If we refer to the original paper [Fey1] of R.P. Feynman, we see that his diﬀerent
paths from a point A to a point B correspond in AQT to the possible normal
modes of the exchanged biquanta. For example, in section 4.13, every path of
Feynman would correspond to a value of “ ρ ” of the number of exchanged biquanta,
. . . between a right a a left string.

4.17 Proposition

The algebraic quantum theory (AQT), which is a mathematical theory of the Physics
of elementary particles, is free of divergences.

Proof. This results essentially from the facts that:

1) the interactions between ﬁelds (and strings) are not realized perturbatively

in AQT according to proposition 4.4.

Consequently, inﬁnite perturbative series have not to be considered.

2) The basic diagrams in AQT concern the exchanges of gravitational, magnetic and
electric biquanta between left and right strings and correspond in QFT to ﬁrst order
perturbative diagrams implying the exchanges of virtual photons between fermions.

4.18 Corollary

The famous self energy diagram in QFT corresponds in AQT to a basic diagram be-
tween a right and a left string belonging to the space “mass” (“ M ”) ﬁeld of an elementary
bisemifermion and exchanging a magnetic biquantum.

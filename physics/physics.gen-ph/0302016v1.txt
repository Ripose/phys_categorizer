Abstract

We show that the AIAS group collection of papers on a “new elec-
trodynamics” recently published in the Journal of New Energy, as well
as other papers signed by that group (and also other authors) appearing
in other established physical journals and in many books published by
leading international publishers (see references) are full of misconceptions
and misunderstandings concerning the theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
and contain fatal mathematical ﬂaws, which invalidates almost all claims
done by the authors. We prove our statement by employing a modern
presentation of Maxwell Theory using Cliﬀord bundles and also develop
the basic ideas of gauge theories using principal and associated vector
bundles.

1 Introduction

A group of 15 physicists (see footnote 64), hereafter called the AIAS group,
signed a series of 60 papers published in a special issue of the journal, J. New
Energy [0](JNE ) with the title: “The New Maxwell Electrodynamic Equations”
and subtitle: “New Tools for New Technologies”. Here we mainly review the
ﬁrst paper of the series, named “On the Representation of the Electromagnetic
Field in Terms of Two Whittaker Scalar Potentials”, hereafter called AIAS 1,
but we also present comments on other papers of the series that pretends to
have created a new electrodynamics which is a gauge theory based on the O(3)
group.

Before presenting the main claims of the AIAS group which we will criticize
If the material concerning the “new
it is important to know the following.
electrodynamics” were published only in the JNE we probably would never have
had contact with it. However, almost all the material of that papers appeared in
one form or another in established and traditional physical journals[13−17,34] and
in several books[4,66−70] published by leading international publishing houses.
It happens that on May, 1999, one of the present authors (W.A.R.) was asked
by the editor of the journal Found. of Physics to referee the ﬁrst three papers
published in[0]. Of course, the papers were rejected, the reason being that these

2

publications can be categorized as a collection of mathematical sophisms[71],
i.e., are full of nonsense mathematics.

We felt that something must start to be doing in order to denounce this state
of aﬀairs to the public1 and to stop the proliferation of mathematical nonsense
in scientiﬁc journals.

The ﬁrst version of AIAS papers was signed by 19 people and Professor J.
P. Vigier was not one of the authors. The other people that ‘signed’ the ﬁrst
version of the manuscripts (MSs) and did not signed the version of that papers
published in[0] are: D. Leporini, J. K. Moscicki, H. Munera, E. Recami and
D. Roscoe. These names are explicitly quoted here because we are not sure
that they knew or even agreed with Evans (the leader of the AIAS group) in
participating as authors of that papers2, although the situation is very confused.
Indeed, some of the people mentioned above signed other papers as members
the AIAS group which have been published in several diﬀerent journals[13−17]3.
All these facts show that there are ethical problems at issue in this whole
aﬀair and they are in our opinion more serious than it appears at a ﬁrst sight,
deserving by themselves a whole discussion. However we will not consider this
enterprise here, and simply concentrate ourselves in analyzing the mathematics
behind some of the main claims of AIAS 14. These are

1The present paper is based on a referee’s report written for Found. Physics, under request
of Professor A. van der Merwe, the editor of that journal. We emphasize here that Professor
van der Merwe has been authorized to inform the AIAS group who wrote the report, but
according to him he didn’t. Also, the contents of the present paper has been presented in an
invited lecture given by W.A.R. at the meeting of the Natural Philosophy Alliance entitled: An
Introduction to 21st Century Physics and Cosmology, hold at the University of Connecticut,
Storrs, CT, June 5-9, 2000. Dr. Hal Fox, the editor of the JNE announced by June,1999
in the internet site of his journal that he intended to publish a series of papers siged by the
AIAS group. He has been discretly advised by W.A.R. that publication of that material could
damage for ever the reputation of the JNE. Dr. Fox did not follow the advice and published
that papers. After attending W.A.R. presentation at Storrs, he invited us to publish our
criticisms in his journal, but we decline to to that, since we do not want our names to be in
any way associated with that periodic. However, since all this aﬀair is an important one, from
several points of view, we decide to publish our criticisms in ROSE, with the hope that it
will be read by physicists and other scientists interested in mantaining science in the highest
possible level.

2At the meeting of the Natural Philosophy Alliance quoted in footnote 2, Dr. Munera was
present. He conﬁrmed to the public attending W.A.R. lecture at that meeting that his name
has been used withouth his consent in some publications of the AIAS group.

3These papers—despite appearing in established physical journals and in books published
by traditional publishing houses—are like the ones published in[0], i.e., are full of mathematical
sophisms. This is an indication of the low level of signiﬁcant part of the present scientiﬁc
literature. We will elaborate more on this issue on another paper. We quote also here that
while preparing the review for the Found. Phys., W.A.R. received a new “improved version”
of the MSs. There, some (but not all) of the absurdities of the papers published in[0](that
indeed correspond to the ﬁrst version of the MSs received for review) have been deleted, but
unfortunately the papers continued a pot-pourri of nonsense. More important is to register
here that three authors ‘decided’ not to sign the ‘improved’ version of the MSs. Eventually they
realized in due time that they would compromise their careers if the physics or mathematics
community would know about their participation in that papers.

4For other important criticisms concerning ~B(3) theory as originally formulated by Evans,

see[58,59,81−83] and references therein.

(i) “The contemporary view that classical electromagnetism is a U (1) gauge
theory relies on the restricted received view of transverse plane waves, U (1)
being isomorphic with O(2) (sic)5, the group of rotations in a plane.”

(ii) “If there are longitudinal components available from the Heaviside-
Maxwell equations (ME )6, then, these cannot be represented by a U (1) gauge
theory.”

(iii) That Whittaker [1,2] proved nearly a hundred years ago “that longitudi-
nal standing waves exist in the vacuum from the most general possible solutions
of the D’Alembert wave equation.”

(iv) That “Jackson’s well known demonstration of longitudinal waves also
illustrates that the group O(2) in gauge theory must be replaced by the group
O(3), that of rotations in three space dimensions, the covering group7 of SU (2)
(sic).”

(v) That (i)-(iii) “leads in turn to the fact that classical electromagnetism
is according to gauge theory a Yangs-Mills theory, with an internal gauge space
that is a vector space, rather than a scalar space as in the received M E.”

(vi) AIAS authors quote that recently a theory of electrodynamics[3−14] (see
also[15−17]) has been proposed based on a physical O(3) gauge space, which re-
duces to the U (1) counterpart under certain circumstances, together with a novel
phase free ﬁeld ~B(3). The quotation of so many papers has as obvious purpose
to suggest to the reader that such a new theory is well founded. Unfortunately,
this is not the case, as we show in detail below.

To show their claims, AIAS authors review in section 2 the work of Whittaker[1,2]

and say that they reviewed the work8 of Jackson[18]. In section 3 they claim to
have developed a theory where a “symmetry breaking of SU (2) to O(3) with
the Higgs ﬁeld gives a view of electromagnetism similar to Whittakers’ in terms
of two scalar potentials.”

In what follows we show9:
(a) That claims (i, ii, v) are wrong.
(b1) We are not going to comment on (iv) because everybody can easily
realize that this quotation is simply misleading concerning the problem at issue.
Concerned (iii) we make some comments (for future reference) on Whit-
taker’s proof in[1] that from D’Alembert equation it follows that there are lon-
gitudinal standing waves in the vacuum.

(b2) That there is a proof that ME possess exact solutions corresponding
to electromagnetic ﬁelds conﬁgurations (EFC ) in vacuum that can move with

5Of course, as it is well known by any competent physicist U (1) is isomorphic with SO(2),
not O(2). In fact, any student with a middle level of knowledge in topology knows that SO(2)

is connected as a topological space while O(2) is not. The determinant function det : O(2)
1, 1
is continuous and send O(2) to the set

R which is not connected in R.

} ⊂
6Hereafter denoted ME.
7Of course, any competent physicist knows that SU (2) is the covering group of SO(3) and
not that O(3) is the covering group of SU (2) as stated in the AIAS papers. This is only a
small example of the fact that AIAS authors do not know elementary mathematics.

and that this fact is well known as documented
in[19−22] (see also [23,25]). These papers that have not been quoted by the AIAS
authors, although there is proof11 that at least 2 of the 16 authors of the ﬁrst
version of AIAS 1 knew references[19,21] very well! This point is important,
because in [19,21] it is shown that, in general, an EFC moving with speeds
0
v < 1 or v > 1 have longitudinal components of the electric and/or of the
magnetic ﬁelds.

≤

(b3) That Whittakers’ presentation of electromagnetism in terms of two
purely “longitudinal” potentials, ~f and ~g is not as general as claimed by the
AIAS authors. Indeed, Whittaker’s presentation is a particular case of Hertz’s
vector potentials theory, known since 1888, a fact that is clearly quoted in Strat-
ton’s book[30]. The appropriate use of Hertz theory allowed the authors of
[19−22,35] to easily prove the existence in vacuum of the arbitrary velocities so-
lutions (0

) of ME.

v <

The claim that Whittaker’s approach shows that there are scalar waves in
the vacuum and that these scalar waves are more fundamental than the poten-
tials and electromagnetic ﬁelds is simply one more of the many unproven claims
resulting from wishful thinking. Our statement will become clear in what fol-
lows.

Concerning (v) we have the following to say12:
(c1) References[3−10]13 do not endorse the view that the U (1) gauge theory
of electromagnetism is incorrect. This claim has been made on many occasions
by Evans while defending (as, e.g., in[28,29]) his ~B(3) theory from his critics
(which are many competent physicists, see[58,59,81−83] and the references in that
papers). Our main purpose in this paper is not to discuss if the concept of the
~B(3) ﬁeld is of some utility to physical science. However we will introduce in
section 2 the main ideas that probably lead Evans[3] to this concept. It will be-
come clear that it is completely superﬂuous and irrelevant. Indeed, the original
deﬁnition given by Evans of ~B(3) makes his theory a non sequitur14. Trying
to save his “theory” he and colleagues (the AIAS group) decide to promote
~B(3) as a gauge theory with O(3) as gauge group.These new develpoments show
very clearly that the members of that group never understood until now what
a gauge theory is. This is particularly clear in his paper[34], entitled “Non-
Abelian Electrodynamics and the Vacuum ~B(3)” which is the starting point for
the theory of section 3 of AIAS 1 and also of many other odd papers published
in [0].

10These solutions, as is the case of the plane wave solutions of ME have inﬁnite energy and
so cannot be produced by any physical device. However, ﬁnite aperture approximations to
that solutions can be produced. These waves have extraordinary properties which have been
studied in details in [37].Among the extraordinary new solutions of ME there are, as particular
cases, standing EFC in vacuum, as proved in[19−21,37]. Moreover, standing EFC with ~E
~B
have been produced in the laboratory[33]. See [19−21,37], and also [32,33].

12Our statements are proved below.

conceptions.

14On this issue, see also[58,59,64].

(c2) The statement that Barrett developed a consistent SU (2) non abelian
electrodynamics is non sequitur. Indeed, at least the Barrett’s papers[5−8] which
we had the opportunity to examine are also a pot-pourri of inconsistent math-
ematics. We will point out some of them, in what follows.

(c3) Quotation of Harmuth’s papers[35] by the AIAS authors is completely

out of context. At the Discussion section of AIAS 1 it is concluded:

“On the U (1) level there are longitudinal propagating solutions of the
potentials ~f and ~g, of the vector potential ~A and the Stratton potential
~S, but not longitudinal propagating components of the ~E and ~B ﬁelds.
So, on the U (1) level, any physical eﬀects of longitudinal origin in free
space depend on whether or not ~f , ~g, ~A and ~S, are regarded as physical
or unphysical”

We explicitly show that:
(d) this conclusion is wrong and results from the fact that the AIAS au-
thors could not grasp the elementary mathematics used in Whittaker’s paper[2].
Moreover, it is important to quote here that recently15 ﬁnite aperture approx-
imations to SEXWs [19−22] (i.e., superluminal electromagnetic X - waves) have
been produced in the laboratory[36] and that these waves, diﬀerently from the ﬁc-
titious ~B(3) ﬁeld of Evans and Vigier, possesses real longitudinal electric and/or
magnetic components.

2 On scalar and longitudinal waves and ~B(3)
As one can learn from Chapter 5 of Whittaker’s book[65], the idea that both
electromagnetic transverse and longitudinal waves16 exists in the aether was a
very common one for the physicists of the XIX century.

As it is well known, in 1905 the concept of photons as the carriers of the elec-
tromagnetic interaction between charged particles has been introduced. Soon,
with the invention of quantum electrodynamics, the photons have been associ-
ated to the quanta of the electromagentic ﬁeld and described by transverse solu-
tions of Maxwell equations, interpreted as an equation for a quantum ﬁeld[72,73].
Longitudinal photons appears in quantum electrodynamics once we want to
mantain relativistic covariance in the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Indeed, as it is well known[72,73] the Gupta- Bleuler formalism introduces be-
sides the transverse photons also longitudinal and timelike photons. These,

15In the ﬁrst version of the AIAS 1 manuscript received by W.A.R. from Found. Phys., E.
Recami, one of member of the group (at that time) certainly knew about the results concerning
the X -waves quoted above. Indeed, [26] quotes [19,21]. To avoid any misunderstanding let us
emphasize here that the ﬁnite aperture approximations to SEXWs are such that their peaks
can travel (for some time) at superluminal speeds. However since these waves have compact
support in the space domain, they have fronts that travel at the speed of light. Thus no
violation of the principle of relativity occurs. More details can be found in [37].

16A transverse wave has non zero components only in directions orthogonal to the propaga-
tion direction, whereas a longitudinal wave has always a non null component in the propagation
direction.

however appears in an equal special “mixture” and cancel out at the end of
electrodynamics calculations. These longitudianl and timelike photons did not
seem to have a physical status. Their introduction in the theory seems to be
only a mathematical necessity17. Some authors, like de Broglie[74] thinks that
a photon has a very small mass. In this case, photons must be described by
Proca’s equation (free of sources) and this equation possess ﬁdedigne longitu-
dinal solutions, besides the transverse ones. There is a wrong opinion among
physicists that only Proca’s equation have longitudinal solutions, but the fact
is that the free ME 18 possess inﬁnite families of solutions (in vacuum) that
have longitudinal electric and/or magnetic components. The existence of these
solutions has been shown in[19−22,37] and can be seem to exist in a quite easy
way from the Hertz potential theory developed in section 4 below. We em-
phasize here that Hertz potential theory was known (in a particular case) by
Whittaker. He produced formulas (see eqs.(68) below) which clearly show the
possiblity of obtaining exact solutions of the free ME with longitudinal electric
and/or magnetic ﬁelds.

¿From this coincidence and the fact that the combination ~E(1)

~E(2) ap-
pears also as an “eﬀective” magnetic ﬁeld in a term of the phenomenogical
Hamiltonian formulated by Pershan et al. in 1966[75] in their theory of the in-
verse Faraday eﬀect Evans claimed ﬁrst in [3] and then in a series of papers and
books20 that the ﬁeld ~B(3) is a fundamental longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld wich is
an integral part of any plane wave ﬁeld conﬁguration. Obviously, this is sheer
nonse, and Silverman’s in his wonderful book[64] wrote in this respect:

×

“Expression (12)21 is specially interesting, for it is not, in my experience, a par-
ticularly well-known relation. Indeed, it is suﬃciently obscure that in recent years an
extensive scientiﬁc literature has developed examining in minute detail the far reach-
ing electrodynamic, quantum, and cosmological implications of a “new” nonlinear
light interaction proportional to ~E(1)
~E(2) (deduced by analogy to the Poynting vec-
~B(2)) and intrpreted as a “longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld” carried by the
tor ~S ∝ ~E(1)
photon. Several books have been written on the subject. Were any of this true, such a
radical revision of Maxwellian electrodynamics would of course be highly exciting, but
it is regrettably the chimerical product of self-delusion—just like the “discovery” of
N-Rays in the early 1900s. (During the period 1903-1906 some 120 trained scientists
published almost 300 papers on the origins and characteristics of a tottaly spurious
radiation ﬁrst purpoted by a french scientist, Ren´e Blondlot22).”23

Of course, the real meaning of the right hand side of eq.(12) is that it is a
generalization of the concept of helicity which is deﬁned for a single photon in
quantum theory[73]. Here we only quote[.63] that, e.g., for a a right circularly
polarized plane wave (helicity

According to Hunter[58,59], experiments[76,77] have been done in order to

The above discussion shows in our opinion very clearly that Evans’ ~B(3)
theory is simply wrong. Despite this fact, Evans and collaborators ( the AIAS
group) taking into account the last equality in eq.(7) decided to promote ~B(3)
theory to a gauge theory with gauge group O(3). In the development of that idea
the AIAS group produced a veritable compendium of mathematical sophisms.
In their enterprise, the AIAS authors used both very good and interesting ma-

20Some of these papers are in the list of references of the present paper. See also the

references in[58,59,81−83].

21In Silverman’s book his eq.(34), pp.167 is the one that corresponds to our eq.(12).
22The amazing history of the N-rays aﬀair is presented in[80].
23Of course, Silverman is refering to Evans, which togheter with some collegues (the AIAS
group) succeded in publishing several books edited by leading publishing houses and also so
many papers even in respectable physical journals. The fact is that Evans and collaborators
produced a vast amount of sheer non sense mathematics and physics, some of then discused in
other sections of the present paper. Production of mathematical nonsense is not a peculiarity
of the AIAS group. Indeed, there are inumerous examples of mathematical sophisms published
in the recent Physics literature.This fact reﬂects the low level of university education in the

in publishing many papers (and books) and the truth is that they probably would not be
approved in a freshman calculus examination in any serious university.

done by other authors concerning reformulation of Maxwell electrodynamics. In
what follows we discuss the main mathematical ﬂaws of these proposals.

3 Comments on Whittaker’s 1903 paper of Math-

ematische Annalen

Whittaker’s paper[1] is a classic, however we have some reservations concerning
its section 5.5, entitled: Gravitation and Electrostatic Attraction explained as
modes of Wave-disturbance. There, Whittaker observed that as a result of
section 5.1 of his paper, it follows that any solution of the wave equation25

∂2V
∂x2 +

∂2V
∂y2 +

∂2V

∂z2 = K2 ∂2V

∂t2

can be analyzed in terms of simple plane waves and that this fact throws a new
light on the nature of forces, such as gravitation and electrostatic attraction,
which vary as the inverse square of the distance. Whittaker’s argument is that
for a system of forces of this character, their potential (or their component in
any given direction) satisﬁes the Laplace equation

∂2V
∂x2 +

∂2V
∂y2 +

∂2V
∂z2 = 0

−

and therefore `a fortiori also satisﬁes eq.(13), where K is any constant. Then,
Whittaker said that it follows that this potential V (or any force component,
e.g., Fx =
∂V /∂x) can be analyzed into simple plane waves, in various direc-
tions, each wave being propagated with constant velocity, and that these waves
interfere with each other in such a way that, when the action has once set up,
the disturbance at any point does not vary with time, and depends only on the
coordinates (x, y, z) of the point. To prove his statement, Whittaker constructs
the electrostatic or Newton gravitational potential as follows:

(i) Suppose that a particle is emitting spherical waves, such that the distur-
bance at a distance r from the origin, at time t, due to those waves whose wave
length lies between 2π/k and 2π/(k + dk) is represented by

where v is the phase velocity of propagation of the waves. Then after the waves
have reached the point r, so that (vt
r) is positive, the total disturbance at
the point (due to the sum of all the waves) is

eq.(16) as

.

(17)

(iii) Whittaker concludes that:

“The total disturbance at any point, due to this system of waves, is there-
fore independent of the time, and is everywhere proportional to the grav-
itational potential due to the particle at that point.”

(iv) That in each one of the constituent terms sin(kvt

kr)/r the potential
will be constant along each wave-front, and “consequently the gravitational force
in each constitutient ﬁeld will be perpendicular to the wave-front, i.e., the waves
will be longitudinal.”

−

Now, we can present our comments.

(a) As it is well known, when we have a particle at the origin, the potential
satisﬁes Poisson equation with a delta function source term, and not Laplace
equation as stated by Whittaker, and indeed (17) satisﬁes Poisson equation. It
is an interesting fact that a sum of waves which are non singular at the origin
produces a “static wave” with a singularity at that point.

(b) Whittaker’s hypothesis (i) is ad hoc, he did not present any single ar-
gument to justify why a charged particle, at rest at the origin must be emit-
ting spherical waves of all frequencies, with the frequency spectrum implicit in
eq.(15).

(c) A way to improve Whittaker’s model should be to represent the electric
charge as a particular electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration modeled by a UPW 26
solution of eq.(13) (with27 v = c, the velocity of light in vacuum) non singular
at r = 0 . The simplest stationaries solutions are[19]:

sin(kr)
kr

sin ωt,

sin(kr)
kr

cos ωt,

k = ω

(18)

From, these solutions it is easy to build a new one with a frequency distri-
bution such that it is possible to recover the Coulomb potential under the same
conditions as the ones used by Whittaker. This is a contribution for the idea of
modeling particles as PEPs, i.e., pure electromagnetic particles[19−21].

We call the readers attention that the idea of longitudinal waves (in the
aether) was a very common one for the physicists of the XIX century. In this
respect the reader should consult Chapter 5 of Whittaker’s book[65].

26UPWs means Undistorted Progressive Waves. In fact, UPWs of ﬁnite energy do not exist
according to Maxwell linear theory, but quasi-UPWs with a very long ‘lifetime’ can eventually
be constructed by appropriate superpositions of UPWs solutions. Of course, the non existence
of ﬁnite energy UPWs solutions of ME shows clearly the limits we can arrive when pursuing
such kind of ideas inside the frame of a linear theory.

27We use a system of units such that c = 1.

11

Moreover, we quote that Landau and Lifshitz in their classical book[60] (sec-
tion 52) after making the Fourier resolution of the Coulomb electrostatic ﬁeld,
got that

~E =

d3~k
(2π)3

~Bk exp(i~k

·

and

~Bk =

i

−

(19)

and concludes:

“From this we see that the ﬁeld of the waves, into which we have resolved
the Coulomb ﬁeld, is directed along the wave vector. Therefore these
waves can be say to be longitudinal.”

Well, we must comment here that since each ~Bk is an imaginary vector it
cannot represent any realized electric ﬁeld in nature. This show the danger that
exist when working with complex numbers in the analysis of physical problems.

5.2 Comments on section 2 of AIAS 1

(i) It is obvious that Whittaker’s theory, as presented by the AIAS authors,
is simply a particular case of Hertz theory and so it does not deserve to be
called Whittaker’s theory. Indeed, what Whittaker did, in the notation of AIAS
authors, was to put

~f =

~Πe = Fˆk,

~g = ~Πm = Gˆk,

−

(cid:3)~Πe = 0,

(cid:3)~Πm = 0.

i.e., he used only two degrees of freedom of the six possible ones.

¿From eqs.(66) and (67) we compute the cartesian components of ~Ee, ~Be
appearing in the decomposition of Fe = ~Ee + i ~Be (see eq.(65)). We have, as

this kind which have been obtained with the Hertz potential method. In these
papers it was found that, in general, these exactly solutions of ME correspond
to theoretical waves traveling with speeds31 0
v < 1 or v > 1. Moreover,
these waves are UPWs, i.e., undistorted progressive waves32! More important is
the fact that, recently, ﬁnite apperture approximations for optical SEXWs (i.e.,
superluminal electromagnetic X -waves) which have longitudinal electric and/or
magnetic ﬁelds have been produced in the laboratory by Saari and Reivelt[36].
It is clear also from this approach that theoretically there exists transverse
electromagnetic waves such that their ﬁelds can be derived from the potential
1-forms with longitudinal components, but this fact did not give any ontology
to the potential vector ﬁeld.

(iii) From (ii) it follows that the AIAS group conclusions, in the discussion

section of AIAS 1, namely:

“On the U (1) level there are longitudinal propagating solutions of the
potentials ~f and ~g, of the vector potential ~A and the Stratton potential
~S, but not longitudinal propagating components of the ~E and ~B ﬁelds.
So, on the U (1) level, any physical eﬀects of longitudinal origin in free
space depend on whether or not ~f , ~g, ~A and ~S, are regarded as physical
or unphysical.”

is completely wrong 33, because all results described in (iii) have been ob-
tained from classical electromagnetism which is a U (1) gauge theory. We will
31These are not phase velocities, of course, but genuine propagation velocities. The inter-

pretation of the superluminarity observed in the experiment [36] is presented in [37].

32To avoid any misunderstanding here, we recall again that exact superluminal UPWs solu-
tions of ME cannot be realized in the physical world. The reason is that, like the monochro-
matic plane waves they have inﬁnity energy. However ﬁnite aperture approximations to su-
perluminal waves can be produced. They have very interesting properties (see [37]).

33This statement came from the fact that in the example studied by Whittaker and copied

by the AIAS authors the functions F and G used are linear in the variables x and y.

discuss more about this issue later because, as already stated, it is clear that
AIAS authors have not a single idea of what a gauge theory is.

(iv) After these comments, we must say that we are perplexed not only with
the very bad mathematics of the AIAS group, but also with the ethical status
of some of its present and/or past members. Indeed, the fact is that the papers
mentioned in (ii) above have not been quoted by the AIAS group. This is
ethically unacceptable34, since Evans is one the members of the group, and
he knew all the points mentioned above, since he quoted[19−21] in some of his
papers, as pointed out in footnote 12.

6 Gauge Theories

We already saw that ME possess exact solutions that are EFC with longitudinal
electric and/or magnetic components. In order,

(a) to understand why the existence of this kind of solutions did not imply
that we must consider electromagnetism as a gauge theory with gauge group
diﬀerent from U (1) and,

(b) to understand that the section on “Non-Abelian Electrodynamics” of
AIAS 1 and also a number of other papers in [0] and also the “Non-Abelian
Electrodynamics of Barret” are non sequitur and a pot-pourri of inconsistent
mathematics, it is necessary to know exactly what a gauge theory is. The only
coherent presentation of such a theory is through the use of rigorous mathemat-
ics. We need to know at least very well the notions of:

(i) Principal Bundles

(ii) Associated Vector bundles to a given principal bundle

(iii) Connections on Principal Bundles

(iv) Covariant derivatives of sections of a Vector Bundle

(v) Exterior Covariant derivatives

(vi) Curvature of a Connection

After these notions are known we can introduce concepts used by physicists

as gauge potentials, gauge ﬁelds, and matter ﬁelds.

34We take the opportunity to say that paper[26] which deals with “superluminal solutions”
of ME has good and new things. However the good things are not new and can be found in[21]
(and in reference 5 of that paper, which has not been published). The new things are not
good. Contrary to what is stated there, there is no UPW X -wave like solution of Schr¨odinger
equation (for a proof see [51]). Moreover, the claim done by the author of[26] (followed with
a “proof”) that he predicted the existence of superluminal X -waves from tachyon kinematics
is obviously non sequitur and must be considered as a joke. In time, we are quoting these
facts, because the author of[26] signed several papers as member of the AIAS group, and as
we already said, appears as one of the authors of the ﬁrst version of the MSs (now published
in[0]) sent to W. A. R. by the editor of Found. Phys., which asked for a review of that papers.

Of course, we do not have any intention to present in what follows a mono-
graph on the subject35. However, to grasp what a gauge theory is, we will recall
in the next subsection the main deﬁnitions and results of the general theory
adapted for the case where the base manifold of the bundles used is Minkowski
spacetime. Our presentation clariﬁes some issues which according to our view
are obscure in many physics textbooks.

6.1 Some deﬁnitions and theorems

As in sections 2 and 3, let (M, g) be Minkowski spacetime manifold36.

1. A ﬁber bundle over M with Lie group G will be denoted by (E, M, π, G, F ).
E is a topological space called the total space of the bundle, π : E
M is a
continuous surjective map, called the canonical projection and F is the typical
ﬁber. The following conditions must be satisﬁed:

Observation 1: To complete the deﬁnition of a ﬁber bundle it is necessary to
deﬁne the concept of equivalent ﬁber bundles[39]. We do not need to use this
concept in what follows and so are not going to introduce it here.

If U = M we say that s is a global section. There is a relation between cross-
sections and local trivializations. In fact, the existence of a global cross section
on a principal bundle implies that this bundle is equivalent to the trivial one.

6. To deﬁne the concept of a connection on a PFB (P, M, π, G), we recall
that since dim(M ) = 4, if dim(G) = n, then dim(P ) = n + 4. Obviously, for

Now, roughly speaking a connection on P is a rule that makes possible a

A horizontal lift of σ is a curve ˆσ : I

transport of p).
It is intuitive that such a transport takes place in P along
directions speciﬁed by vectors in TpP , which do not lie within the vertical space
VpP . Since the tangent vectors to the paths of the basic manifold passing
M span the entire tangent space TxM , the corresponding
through a given x
vectors Xp
TpP (in whose direction parallel transport can generally take place
in P ) span a four-dimensional linear subspace of TpP called the horizontal space
of TpP and denoted by HpP . Now, the mathematical concept of a connection
can be presented. This is done through three equivalent deﬁnitions (c1, c2, c3)
given below which encode rigorously the intuitive discussion given above. We
have,

41Here we may be tempted to realize that as it is possible to construct the vertical space
P then we can deﬁne a horizontal space as the complement of this space in respect

space in every point. This is possible only by means of a connection.

Since x = π(ˆσ(t)) for any curve in P such that ˆσ(t)

π−1(x) and ˆσ(0) = p0,
we conclude that π∗ maps all vertical vectors in the zero vector in TxM , i.e.,

the local curvature), ρ is taken as the vector representation of SU (2) and F is
taken as the linear space su(2), the Lie algebra of SU (2). This is exactly what
is done in the formulation of the famous ‘t Hooft-Polyakov monopole theory,
as described, e.g., in Ryder’s book[44], a reference that AIAS authors used, but
certainly did not undestand a single line.

6.2 Electromagnetism as a U(1) gauge theory

We shall consider here a principal ﬁber bundle over the Minkowski spacetime
M with structure group U (1).

Recall that U (1) is isomorphic to SO(2), a fact that we denote as usual by
SO(2). This makes possible to parametrize U (1) by elements of the

dAV = dAW , leading to FV = FW on V

Of, course, without any additional hypothesis it is impossible to derive which

a variational problem on P which produces the desired equation[40]. By pulling
back through a local section σV : V

We discussed at length in 3 that this set of equations possess an inﬁnite

number of solutions which are non transverse waves in free space.

This shows that the statement that the existence of non transverse waves

implies that electromagnetism cannot be described by a U (1) theory is false.

Eq.(164) (Bianchi identity) is the generalization of the homogeneous Maxwell
equation dF = 0 , which, as it is well known, reads ∂ρFµν + ∂µFνρ + ∂νFρµ = 0,
when written in components.

Now, which is the analogous of the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation δF =

Je, which in local components reads ∂µFµν = Je ν?

−

As, in the case of Maxwell theory, the analogous equation for the SU (2)
gauge theory cannot be obtained without extra assumptions. For the vacuum
case, i.e., when the gauge ﬁeld is only interacting with itself, the analogous of
δA = 0 is postulated[43] to be

DµFµν = ∂µFµν + [Aµ, Fµν] = 0,

Aµ = ηµν Aν.

For the case where the gauge ﬁeld is in interaction with some matter ﬁeld
which produces a conserved current Jµ = J a
µga, and the theory is supposed
to be derivable from an action principle, the analogous of the inhomogeneous
Maxwell equations results

7 Flaws in the “new electrodynamics”

foundations of the “new electrodynamics” of the AIAS group and of Barrett.

In eq.(170), the bold notation means a vector in isospace and the

as in section 3 above, means an Euclidean vector.

By using the notations of eq.(170) we can write eqs.(164) and eq.(168) as a
system of Maxwell-like equations in the vector calculus formalism. Choosing a
matricial representation for the Lie algebra of su(2) by putting ga = ˆσa, where
ˆσa are the Pauli matrices we get, the following equations resembling the ones of
classical electromagnetism49:

Now, before proceeding it is very important to note that in[6−8] Barrett
used the same symbols in both the non abelian Maxwell equations and the
amended Harmuth’s equations. He did not distinguish between the bold and
arrow notations and indeed used no bold nor arrow notation at all. He then
said[6]:

“comparing the SU (2) formulation of Maxwell equations and the Harmuth
equations reveals the following identities”

and then presents the list. We write only one of these identities in what
follows using only here in the text the same notation as the one used by Barrett
in[6−8],

·
Also, it is quite obvious that it is impossible to identify ρe with ρe. The
ﬁrst is the zero component of a vector in Minkowski spacetime, being a real
function, whereas the second is a real function (a zero-form) taking values in
isotopic vector space.

−

·

It is moreover clear that trying to identify ρe with ρe amounts to identify
also ˜E with ~E, ˜B with ~B, ˜A0 with A0 and ˜A with ~A, ˜J with ~J , a sheer nonsense
.

It is hard to believe that someone could do a confusion like the one above

described. Unfortunately Barrett’s notation seems to indicate that he did.

But, what was Barrett trying to do with the above identiﬁcations? Well,
these “identiﬁcations” had among its objectives50 to present a justiﬁcation for
Harmut’s ansatz51. He wrote[6]:

50Other objectives were to “explain” electromagnetic phenomena that he claims (and also
the AIAS group) that cannot be explained by U (1) electrodynamics. In particular in[8] he
arrived at the conclusion that a ﬁdedigne explanation of the Sagnac eﬀect requires that U (1)
electrodynamics be substituted by a covering theory, that he called the SU (2) gauge electro-
dynamics theory. It is necessary to emphasize here that Sagnac eﬀect is trivially explained
by U (1) electrodynamics and relativity theory. In particular, contrary to what is stated by
Vigier (one of the AIAS authors) in[54−56] the Sagnac eﬀect does not permit the identiﬁca-
tion of a preferred inertial frame. This will be discussed elsewhere. We call also the reader’s
attention on the Vigier statement in[54−56] that the phenomena of unipolar induction permits
the identiﬁcation of a preferred inertial frame is also completely misleading, as shown in[57].
51We show in the section 7 that Harmuth’s “amended equations” constitute a legitimatized
(and quite original) way to solve the original Maxwell equations for a particular physical
problem.

38

“ Consequently, Harmutz’s Ansatz can be interpreted as: (i) a mapping
of Maxwell’s (U (1) symmetrical) equations into a higher order symmetric
ﬁeld (of SU (2) symmetry) or covering space, where magnetic monopoles
and charges exist; (ii) solving the equations for propagation velocities; and
(iii) mapping the solved equations back into the U (1) symmetrical ﬁeld
(thereby removing the magnetic monopole and charge).”

Now, the correct justiﬁcation for Harmuth’s ansatz is simply the very well
known fact that Maxwell equations are invariant under duality rotations[16]and
this has nothing to do with a SU (2) symmetry of any kind.

Besides these misunderstandings by Barrett of Harmuth’s papers, the fact is
that there are other serious ﬂaws in Barret’s papers, and indeed in the section
7 we comment on a really unacceptable error for an author trying to correct
Maxwell theory.

Now, we show that the AIAS group also did not understood the meaning of
the “SU (2) Maxwell’s equations”. The proof of this statement start when we
give a look at page 313 of [0] in a note called “THE MEANING OF BARRETT’S
NOTATION”.

There the AIAS authors quoted that Rodrigues did not understand Barrett’s
notation52, but now we prove that in fact are them who did not understand the
meaning of the SU (2) equations. Observe that eq.(1) at page 313 of [0] is wrongly
printed, the right equation to start the discussion being eq.(171) above. This is
a matrix equation and representing the Lie algebra of su(2) in

did not acknowledged W.A.R. of that fact, and worse, did not inform their “unfortunate”
readers from where they learned that W.A.R. did not understand Barrett’s notation. Well,
they learned that when reading the report that W.A.R. wrote for the Found. Phys. rejecting

8 Inconsistencies in section 3 of AIAS 1

What has been said in the last sections proves that AIAS theory and (also
Barrett’s papers) are sheer nonsense. AIAS authors claims to have proven in
section 3 of AIAS 1 that their non-Abelian electrodynamics is equivalent to
Barrett’s non-Abelian electrodynamics. The fact is that section 3 of AIAS 1 is
simply wrong. It is a pot-pourri of inconsistent mathematics where the authors
make confusions worse yet than the ones pointed above. We dennounce some of
them in what follows. To show the “equivalence” between their approach and
Barrett’s, the AIAS authors introduce a theory where the SU (2) gauge ﬁeld
interacts with a Higgs ﬁeld. The interaction is given by the usual Lagrangian
formalism, as given, e.g., in Ryder’s book[43].

Recall that the Higgs ﬁeld in this case (according to the general deﬁnition
given in 17 of section 4.1 above) is a section of Λ0(M )
E where the vector
space of E is F = su(2). Then, according to the notations introduced in the
last section, H is an isovector and we can write

⊗

where H a : M
C are complex functions54, and ea, a = 1, 2, 3 are the gen-
erators of su(2) (which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of SO(3)) and satisfy

→

H = H aea

(H 1, H 2, H 3),

≡

[ea, eb] = iǫc

abec.

(182)

(183)

We now exhibit explicitly some of the mathematical nonsense of section 3 of
AIAS 1.

53This equation has been written between quotation marks in order to identify that it is
a wrong equation. The same convention applies to all wrong equations quoted from other
authors.

54Note that in eq.(41) of AIAS 1, the AIAS authors describe a situation where H 1 = H 2 = 0
and H 3 = √m, where m is the mass of the Higgs ﬁeld. This shows clearly that they start
their “theory” using a Higgs ﬁeld which is a section of Λ0(M )
E, where the vector space of
E is F = su(2)

(i) Eq.(43) of AIAS 1 is wrong. The right equation for F a

Note that, as emphasized in section 4 , F a

ij is eq.(161) above.
j are scalar functions and

(ii) In eq.(67) AIAS authors changed their mind about the mathematical
nature of the H a, and in a completely ad hoc way, assumed that the H a, a = 1, 2,
are given by

“H a = F a

i ei”, for a = 1, 2.

(184)

The ﬁrst remark here is that the AIAS authors do not explain in which space
the ei live.
If we give a look at the equations following their eq.(56) it ap-
pears that the ei, i = 1, 2, 3, are basis vectors of a 3-dimensional vector space.
This makes eq.(184) [eq.(43) in AIAS 1] sheer nonsense and invalidates all their
calculations55.

(iii) The inconsistency can be seen also with the deﬁnition of ~B(3) given in
eq.(66) of AIAS 1. Since until eq.(65) of AIAS 1 the H a are functions (which is
the case until eq.(67) in AIAS 1), the authors deﬁne

Then, they write for “B(3)”,

“A1 =

H 1,

A2 =

H 2”.

(185)

(186)

The equality in the second line of eq.(186) (which is eq.(66) of AIAS 1) is ob-
viously wrong. Recall that the H a are complex functions —which seems to be
the case according to eq.(45) and eq.(52) and until eq.(67) of AIAS 1. After
that equation authors change their mind as to the nature of the Hi, in order to
try to give meaning to their eq.(66).
Then they write their eq.(68),

“B(3) = i

e
~ ǫijk∂jF 1

m∂kF 2

nemen” .

(187)

Next a complete ad hoc rule is invoked—explicitly, AIAS authors wrote:

“ Since em, en are orthogonal their product can only be cyclic, so if
emen = ǫmnrer : ...”

After that the AIAS authors proceed by using some other illicit manipula-

tions and very odd logic reasoning to arrive at their eq.(71),

“B(3) = i

e
~ (∂jF 1

j ∂kF 2

k −

∂jF 1

k ∂kF 2

j )” .

(188)

Well, this equation is simply nonsense again, for the ﬁrst member is a vector
function and the second a scalar function.

55In [34], and also several times in[0] we are advised that the

are to be identiﬁed with the
canonical basis of Euclidean (vector) space. Of course, this does not solve the inconsistences
pointed above.

9 A brief comment on Harmuth’s papers

In the abstract of the ﬁrst of Harmuth’s papers[35] he said that there was never
a satisfactory concept of propagation velocity of signals within the framework
of Maxwell theory that is represented by Maxwell equations

~E = ρe,

~B = 0,

~D = ε ~E,

(189)

(190)

He also said that the often mentioned group velocity fails on two accounts,
one being that it is almost always larger than the velocity of light56 in radio
transmission through the atmosphere; the other being that its derivation implies
a transmission rate of information equal to zero.

Harmuth recalls that he searched in vain in the literature for a solution of
Maxwell equations for a wave with a beginning and an end (i.e., with compact
support in the time domain), that could represent a signal57, propagating in a
lossy medium. He said also that “one might think that the reason is the practical
diﬃculty of obtaining solutions, but this is only partly correct”. He arrives at
the conclusion that “ the fault lies with Maxwell equations rather than their
solutions”. He said “in general, there can be no solutions for signals propagating
in lossy media.” and concludes “more scientiﬁcally, Maxwell equations fail for
waves with nonnegligible relative frequency bandwidth propagating in a medium
with non negligible losses”. His suggestion to overcome the problem is to add a
magnetic current density in Maxwell equations, thus getting58

He said that:
“but the remedy is even more surprising than the failure, since it is generally
agreed that magnetic currents have not been observed and it is known from the study
of monopoles that a magnetic current density can be eliminated or created by means of
a so-called duality transformation. The explanation of both riddles is the singularities
encountered in the course of calculation. If one chooses the current density zero before

56There are now several experiments that show that superluminal group velocities have
physical meaning as, e.g., [52,53]. A recent review of the status of what is superluminal wave
motion can be found in [37].

57Sommerfeld and Brillouin[46], called signals: (i) electromagnetic waves such that, each
one of its non null components is zero at z = 0, for t < 0 and equal to some function f (t) for
t > 0, or: waves with compact support in the time domain, i.e., at z = 0 the signal f (t) is
non zero only for 0 < t < T .

58Contrary to what thinks Barrett, the formulation of a extended electrodynamics including
phenomenological charges and phenomenological (i.e., non topological) monopoles do not lead
to an SU (2) gauge theory.

Instead, we are naturally lead to a U (1)

reaching the last singularity, one obtains no solution: if one does so after reaching the
last singularity, one gets a solution.”

Here we want to comment that with exception of the above inspired ansatz,
the remaining mathematics of Harmuth’s paper was already very well known at
the time he published[35]. We repeat below some of his calculations to clearly
separate the new and old knowledgment in his approach. This will be important
in order to comment one more of Barrett’s ﬂaws. So, in what follows we show
that using the duality invariance of ME and Harmuth’s ansatz that in a lossy
medium the dynamics of a wave with compact support in the spatial domain is
such that its front propagates with the speed

show that even in the limit when s = 0, we still have a solution for the usual
Maxwell system without the magnetic current.

The last statement can be proved as follows. Since in Harmuth’s papers
µ and ε are supposed constants, we can make a scale transformation in the
generalized ME and write them in the Cliﬀord bundle as

∂ ˆF = ˆJe + γ5 ˆJm =
ˆJe = ˆσ ˆEiγi, ˆJm = ˆs ˆH iγi,

It follows that starting with a solution ˆF (t, x, s) of Maxwell equation with

only the electric current if

Then, in this case, if there exists the limit,

ˆF (t, x, s) = ˆF1(t, x),

lim
s→0

(202)

it follows that, ˆF1(t, x) is a solution of ME only with the electric current term.

Now, we note by the remaining of the proof that the front of the signal
travels with the velocity c1 is known at least since 1876! Indeed, recall that the
equations for a transmission line, where the variables are the potential V (t, y)
and the current I(t, y), satisfy a system of partial diﬀerential equations that is
identical to the system (198) since we have[47] for the equations describing the
propagation of signals in the transmission line,

the fact that eq.(204) with conditions (205) possess solutions such that the front
of the wave (the signal) propagates with a ﬁnite velocity, namely the velocity
c1, can be found in many textbooks. We like particularly the presentation of

Now, we can present another unpardonable Barrett’s ﬂaw in[8]. He explicitly
wrote that it is possible to identify eq.(198), which he called “a two-dimensional
nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (without boundary conditions)” (sic) as a
sine-Gordon equation, and gives for the equation the usual solitonic solution
(hyperbolic tangent).

10 Conclusion

A. The AIAS 1 paper should never be published by any serious journal be-
cause59:

(i) as proved above its section 2 is simply a (bad) review of Whittaker’s

paper theory and a trivial calculation of ~B(3) in that formalism.

(ii) AIAS authors did not realize that Whittaker’s formalism is a particular
case of the more general Hertz potential method, which has been used in[19−22]
to prove that Maxwell equations in vacuum possess exact arbitrary speeds (0
≤
v <
) UPWs solutions, and that in general the sub and superluminal solutions
are not transverse waves. The existence of non transverse waves has also been
proved by Kiehn[47]. Moreover, at least two of the authors of the present AIAS

59We must say that (unfortunately) this applies also to the other 59 papers of the AISA

group published in the special issue: J. New Energy 4(3), 1-335 (1999).

group knew these facts, namely Bearden and Evans and yet they quote no
references[19−22].

(iii) It follows from (ii) that existence of non transverses waves in vacuum
does not imply that electromagnetism is not a U (1) gauge theory. Indeed, it
is clear that AIAS authors simply do not know what a gauge theory is. This
gave us the motivation for writing section 3 of this report. We hope it may be
of some help for readers that want to know about the absurdities written by
the AIAS group and also for those among that authors that want to know the
truth.

(iv) Section 3 of AISA1 is a pot-pourri of inconsistent mathematics as we
proved in section 6 above. Note that we did not comment on some odd and
wrong statements like “The Higgs ﬁeld is a mapping from SU (2)
→
S(3)”, which show that indeed authors of NS did not understand what they
read in p. 410 of Ryder’s book[43]60.

B. The quotation that Barrett developed a consistent SU (2) gauge theory of
electromagnetism is non sequitur. Indeed, we proved that Barrett’s papers[5−8]
are as the AIAS papers, full of mathematical inconsistencies. Also, quotation of
Harmuth’s papers[35] by AIAS authors is out of context (and its use by Barrett
is a complete nonsense).

We could continue pointing many other errors in the papers of the AIAS
group published in the special issue of the J. New Energy [0] or in other publica-
tions, but after our analysis of AIAS 1 it should be clear to our readers that such
an enterprise should be given as exercises for the training of advanced mathe-
matical and physical students in the identiﬁcation of mathematical sophisms.

We think that our critical analysis of AIAS 1 and of some other papers of
the AIAS group and also of some papers by other authors quoted by them
serves our proposal of clearly denouncing that very bad mathematics is being
used in physics papers. Worse, these papers are being published in international
journals and books. Someone must stop the proliferation of so much nonsense61.

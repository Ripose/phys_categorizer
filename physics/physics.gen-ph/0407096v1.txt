Abstract

A generalization of the classical electrodynamics for systems in absolute
motion is presented using a possible alternative to the Lorentz transformation.
The main hypothesis assumed in this work are: a) The inertial transformations
relate two inertial frames: the privileged frame S and the moving frame S′
with velocity v with respect to S. b) The transformation of the ﬁelds from S to
the moving frame S′ is given by H′ = a(H−v×D) and E′ = a(E+v×B) where
a is a matrix whose elements depend of the absolute velocity of the system.
c) The constitutive relations in the moving frame S′ are given by D′ = ǫE′,
B′ = µH′ and J′ = ηE′.
It is found that Maxwell’s equations, which are
transformed to the moving frame, take a new form depending on the absolute
velocity of the system. Moreover, diﬀering from classical electrodynamics, it
is proved that the electrodynamics proposed explains satisfactorily the Wilson
eﬀect.

1 Introduction

The extension of Maxwell’s electrodynamics from systems at rest to those in mo-
tion was the fundamental problem of the beginning of the twentieth century.
In
those days, it seemed impossible to detect the absolute motion of the earth (that
is, its motion with respect to the preferred reference frame called ether) by means
of electromagnetic experiments. For the purpose of explaining the negative results
if a system is in uniform trans-
of these experiments, Lorentz’s idea was simple:
lational motion and no fundamental phenomenon is modiﬁed, this means that the

electrodynamic equations are form invariant under a certain transformation. Thus,
Lorentz was the ﬁrst to discover that Maxwell’s equations admit a transformation
that leaves them covariant.

However, it was a well-known fact that the mechanical laws did not have the co-
variance property under the Lorentz transformation. Einstein gave the decisive step
introducing the so-called principle of relativity as a restriction scheme for natural
laws. Mathematically, this principle can be expressed as “the Lorentz covariance of
all the basic laws of physics under a change of inertial reference frame”. This covari-
ance expresses the group property of the transformations since the velocity of every
inertial frame is considered as relative. In this way, it was understood why it had
been impossible to determine the “absolute” velocity by some physical experiment.
Nowadays, physicists agree that the Lorentz transformation describes a funda-
mental symmetry of all natural phenomena. However, it would be interesting to
know if there is any alternative to such transformation. In other words, is there any
transformation between two inertial frames which both agree with the experimental
evidence (that is, kinematically equivalent to the special relativity) and generalize
the Lorentz transformation? Or, on the contrary, is the Lorentz transformation an
unavoidable consequence of nature?

In this sense, Robertson [1] proposed to replace the Einstein’s postulates of
relativity with hypotheses suggested by certain typical optical experiments as a way
of testing the relativity theory. Without these hypotheses, the transformations so
obtained describe a family of transformations which are determined except for three
functions depending on the “absolute” velocity of the reference frame. However,
an implicit hypothesis underlying these transformations is the postulate of equality
of the one-way velocity of light in all directions. A generalization of the Robertson
transformations that eliminates this last postulate was studied by Vargas [2, 3]. This
new family of transformations, therefore, depends on four arbitrary functions of the
velocity of the reference frame. Each member of this family is ﬁxed with a choice
of these four functions and thus it describes a possible alternative to the Lorentz
transformation.

The most interesting member of this family of transformations was found by
Tangherlini [4] and studied by Mansouri & Sexl [5], Chang [6, 7] and Rembieli´nski
[8] among others. Particularly, in this transformation the four-dimensional line ele-
ment is considered as an invariant [2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and, therefore, the Minkowski
metric appears modiﬁed in the moving system losing its diagonality. As a conse-
if
quence, the co-variant and contra-variant components have diﬀerent properties:
the contra-variant component of the temporal coordinate is only dilated, its co-
variant component mixes space and time; while the opposite happens with the spa-
tial coordinate.

2

The expression of Maxwell’s equations under this transformation was deduced by
Chang [6, 7] and by Rembieli´nski [8]. However, a certain ambiguity for the deﬁnition
of the ﬁelds E and B appears as a consequence of using a non-diagonal metric with
a 4-line element invariant.
In order to solve this ambiguity, Rembieli´nski [8] has
supplemented Maxwell’s equations with the equation of motion for the test charge.
As we shall see, this ambiguity is absent under the so-called “inertial transforma-
tions” and, therefore, no operational deﬁnition of electromagnetic ﬁeld via equation
of motion for charged particles is necessary.

The inertial transformations proposed by Selleri have the same mathematical
form that those of Tangherlini, but they admit a diﬀerent interpretation since the
four-dimensional line element is not deﬁned and, therefore, cannot be an invari-
ant [12, 13]. This means that the geometrical structure of the four-dimensional
space-time is not required into the framework of the inertial transformation and,
consequently, the geometrical structure is given by the three-dimensional Euclidean
geometry. Moreover, time is (in one sense) similar to that of classical physics because
the concept of “absolute simultaneity” of the Galilean physics remain valid. 1 Given
these transformations, the one-way velocity of light is the same in all directions only
in the privileged frame. Therefore, in a moving reference frame the one-way velocity
of light will be diﬀerent in every direction. This situation, however, is not in conﬂict
with the known experimental results since the one-way velocity of light has never
been measured (see ref.[13, 14, 15] for a discussion about the non-invariant one-way
velocity of light). Another characteristic, shared with the Tangherlini transforma-
tions, is that the inertial transformations do not form a group. As a consequence,
the absolute velocity will appear in any physical law expressed in an inertial frame
(i.e. the velocity with respect to the preferred frame). 2
In spite of these facts,
the inertial transformations provide a suitable framework within which the eﬀects
of time dilatation, Fitzgerald contraction, the relativistic kinematics of particles, the
phenomenon of aberration of light and Doppler eﬀect can be satisfactorily explained
[13, 14, 15, 16]. Thus, inertial transformations have become a viable alternative to
the Lorentz transformation.

In this paper we generalize the classical Maxwell electrodynamics for moving
systems using the inertial transformations. We show that such an electrodynamics
may be obtained assuming that the ﬁelds transform in a “form similar” to that
1Absolute simultaneity means that two events simultaneous in S (i.e. taking place at the same
t) are judged also simultaneous in S′ (and vice-versa). This property, being a consequence of the
absence of space variables in the transformation of time, does not imply that time is absolute. On
the contrary, time-dilation phenomena similar to those of the special relativity theory [13, 14] can
be explained thanks to the β-dependent factor in the transformation of time (see eq.(1)).

2It must be stressed, however, that the Lorentz covariance and the absolute reference frame can

coexist under the Tangherlini transformations, as has been shown by Rembieli´nski [8, 9].

of special relativity. Finally, we prove that the electrodynamics proposed explains
satisfactorily the Wilson eﬀect.

2 Inertial transformations

In this section we shall present the inertial transformations in their original form as
given by Selleri [12, 13] and generalize them in a vectorial form independent of the
orientation of the axes.

The inertial transformations relate two inertial frames: S (privileged system)

and S′ (moving system), and are given by

t′ = γ−1t
x′ = γ(x − vt)
z′ = z
y′ = y






where γ−2 = 1 − β2, β2 = v2/c2, with v the velocity of S′, and c the two-way
velocity of light.
It is important to note that the inertial transformations are a
direct generalization of the Galilean transformation, as it can be seen doing γ = 1.
The inertial transformations as given in (1) are restricted to the case of parallel
axis of the two coordinate systems and the motion of S′ is in the direction of the x
axis. It is easy to obtain a generalization which is independent of the orientation of
the spatial axes [6]. To do so, we observe that the spatial component will be given
by the same relativistic expression, while the temporal component will be the same
as (1). That is,

t′ = γ−1t
r′ = r + v

(

In order to obtain the inverse transformation, we cannot proceed as in the relativistic
case, that is, inverting the sign of the velocity v. This is due to the diﬀerence in
form of the spatial component of the direct and inverse transformations

at variance with the Lorentz transformation. To obtain such a transformation in
vectorial form, we write the spatial component as

x = γ−1x′ + vγt′

r = r′ + vΘ ,

where, in order to determine Θ, we must multiply scalarly the equation (4) by v
and replace the scalar product r · v by the expression

in the resultant equation. Note that the equation (5) is obtained from (2) multiplying
scalarly r′ by v, and then solving r · v. Finally, substituting Θ we ﬁnd

r · v = γ−1(r′ · v) + v2γt′

,

t = γt′
r = r′ + v

A diﬀerence that appears in the spatial component of this inverse transformation
with respect to those obtained with the Lorentz transformation should be noted:
the exponent of γ is −1, while in the inverse Lorentz transformation is +1.

3 Generalized classical electrodynamics

As it is well-know, the general framework to deal with electromagnetic phenomena
is given by Maxwell’s equations. In a system at rest in the privileged frame S, the
Maxwell equations are given by: 3

Moreover, these equations are supplemented by

∂tB = −∇ × E ,
∂tD + J = ∇ × H .

∇ · B = 0 ,
∇ · D = ρ ,
∂tρ + ∇ · J = 0 ,

with the constitutive relations (for isotropic bodies),

D = ǫE , B = µH ,

J = ηE ,

where ǫ is the dielectric constant, µ is the permeability, and η is the electric con-
ductivity and these will be supposed constant throughout the medium. Moreover,
in empty space we have η = 0, D = ǫ0E and B = µ0H, where ǫ0µ0 = 1/c2 is the
two-way velocity of light.

3We will use the MKSQ system of units.

In order to obtain Maxwell’s equations in the moving frame S′, ﬁrst we must
write the transformation formulae for the spatial and temporal derivatives. In the
simplest case, given by the transformation, (1), we have:

and for the vectorial case given by (2), we have:

We note that the Galilean case is obtained with γ = 1. It will be convenient to
work with a form of this equation similar to (10), but without the distinctive role
of the x axis. To obtain it, we write the gradient operator of eq. (11) as

∇ =

γ − 1
v2

[v(v · ∇′) − v2∇′] + γ∇′

,

using the decomposition ∇ = (∇k, ∇⊥), with the subscripts k and ⊥ denoting
parallel and perpendicular to the velocity v. Then, we ﬁnd

∂t = γ−1∂′
∇ = γ ˜∇′

moving frame S′ by

∂tA = γ−1∂′

tA − γ(v · ˜∇′)A .

Applying vectorial algebra, it becomes

∂tA = γ−1∂′

tA − γ ˜∇′ × (A × v) − γv ˜∇′ · A .

(13)

Now it is easy to obtain the Maxwell equations in terms of the coordinates of
the moving frame S′. Substituting both the expression that is equivalent to (13)
and the transformation of the gradient (12) in the equations (7), we obtain

γ−1∂′
tB − γ ˜∇′ × (B × v) − γv ˜∇′ · B = −γ ˜∇′ × E ,
tD − γ ˜∇′ × (D × v) − γv ˜∇′ · D + J = γ ˜∇′ × H .

γ−1∂′

(14)

The supplementary equations transform if we apply (12) directly:

γ ˜∇′ · B = 0 ,
γ ˜∇′ · D = ρ ,
tρ − γ(v · ˜∇′)ρ + γ ˜∇′ · J = 0 .

γ−1∂′

By considering the ﬁrst two equations (15), we may simplify the expressions (14)

to obtain

γ−1∂′

tB = −γ ˜∇′ × (E + v × B) ,
tD + J − ρv = γ ˜∇′ × (H − v × D) .

γ−1∂′

It is important to note that we have assumed no transformation form for the
ﬁelds yet. If we assume that the ﬁelds are the same in both frames S and S′, that
is, if the following relations are valid,

H(r, t) = H′(r′, t′) , B(r, t) = B′(r′, t′) ,

E(r, t) = E′(r′, t′) , D(r, t) = D′(r′, t′) ,

the equations (16) become, for low velocities (i.e., for γ = 1), an electrodynamics
“invariant” under Galilean transformations. That is, those equations express the
electromagnetism in the privileged frame as described from a moving frame with
velocity v. However, it is well-known that such an electrodynamics does not agree
with the experimental results. Therefore, in order to obtain an electrodynamics
in agreement with the experiment, we shall assume that the ﬁelds do not remain
invariant in both reference frames. That is, we assume that the expressions into the
rotor on the right hand side of the equations (16) represent (except for a matrix-
coeﬃcient) the ﬁelds in the moving frame. In other words, we shall postulate the
following transformation laws:

(15)

(16)

(17)

where the matrix a has the form

with ak and a⊥ non nulls for any v, and to be determined. The simple form assumed
for the matrix a is due to the following: (a) It has to be of 2x2-dimension due to the

H′ = a(H − v × D) ,

E′ = a(E + v × B) ,

decomposition of the ﬁelds in their parallel and perpendicular components. (b) It
could have their four elements not equals and depending of the value of the absolute
velocity of the system. (c) However, the non-diagonal elements are zeros due to the
invariance of the systems under rotations, because if the parallel and perpendicular
components are mixed (as it happens when the non-diagonal elements are non nulls),
this invariance would disappear. Thus, it remains only two elements not necessarily
equals to be determined. Moreover, it should be noted that we have assumed the
same matrix for both H′ and E′.

Now we can obtain the transformation law for the ﬁelds B′ and D′. To do this,
we use the constitutive relations in vacuum, valid not only in the privileged frame
S (i.e.,D = ǫ0E and B = µ0H) but also in the moving frame S′ (i.e., D′ = ǫ0E′ and
B′ = µ0H′). Multiplication by µ0 and ǫ0 in the ﬁrst and second eq. (17) and the
use of µ0ǫ0 = 1/c2 yield

B′ = a[B −

1
c2 (v × E)] ,
1
c2 (v × H)]
The inverse transformation can be obtained with the expressions of E and H of

D′ = a[D +

the equations (17):

H = a−1H′ + ǫ0v × (a−1E′ − v × B) ,

E = a−1E′ − µ0v × (a−1H′ + v × D) ,

where a−1 is the inverse matrix of a given by

a−1 =

From the above equations, we can obtain the components which are parallel and

perpendicular to the velocity v:

k (H′ + v × D′)k , H⊥ = γ2a−1

⊥ (H′ + v × D′)⊥ ,

Ek = a−1

k (E′ − v × B′)k , E⊥ = γ2a−1

⊥ (E′ − v × B′)⊥ ,

(19)

where clearly (v × D′)k = 0 and (v × B′)k = 0. Using the constitutive relations in
vacumm, we have

Now we can obtain the Maxwell equations valid in the moving frame S′. We

calculate the second member of (16) by substituting the equations (17):

To complete our equations we need to know the constitutive relations for a
material medium. Here we shall assume that the following constitutive relations are
valid in the frame S′:

D′ = ǫE′

, B′ = µH′

,

J′ = ηE′

(25)

That the constitutive equations have the same form of eq.(9) with the same
material constants ǫ, µ and η in both S and S′ is an assumption which can be tested
indirectly testing their consequences. In other words, if this hypothesis is true must
be inferred from the way this framework describes the accepted knowledge and
predicts results amenable of empirical control.

With the expression of J′ and the transformation of E′ (eq.(17)), the Ohm law

in the moving frame, J′ = ηE′, becomes in the same relativistic form:

γ(J − ρv)k = η(E + v × B)k ,

(J − ρv)⊥ = ηγ(E + v × B)⊥ .

(26)

Now we can determine the transformation laws for the ﬁelds B′ and D′ in a
material medium by following the same steps used for the ﬁelds in vacuum. That
is, we multiply by µ and ǫ in the ﬁrst and second equation (17), and then using
D = ǫE and B = µH, and the new assumption (25) we obtain:

10

B′ = a(B − µǫv × E) ,

D′ = a(D + µǫv × H) .

(27)

As a consequence, the transformation properties of the ﬁelds B′ and D′ will
depend on the properties of the medium, which is reasonable in the present context
of absolute motion. 4

In summary, we have obtained Maxwell’s equations, the supplementary equations
and the transformations of the ﬁelds for a frame in motion with respect to the
privileged frame. It is important to note that the equations (23) and (24) express
electromagnetism as described in the moving frame S′ with absolute velocity v. It
should be note, moreover, that the ﬁnal form of the equations has been obtained
thanks to the relation (22) and to the particular choice of the coeﬃcients ak = 1
and a⊥ = γ. With these, it is easy to see from the eqs. (17) and (19), that the
ﬁelds transform in the same way as under the Lorentz transformation. However,
a such choice of the coeﬃcients could be wrong and the equations could take a
diﬀerent form. In the following section, we shall prove that our electrodynamics is
both theoretically consistent and in agreement with the experiment (and with the
special relativity) only if the relation (22) is valid.

4 The Rowland eﬀect

From the expressions (23) we can see a term (known as “convenction current”) de-
pending on the absolute velocity of the inertial reference frame S′. This convection
current ρv produces a magnetic ﬁeld (Rowland’s eﬀect), that was used by Roentgen
in 1888 in an attempt to measure the so-called “wind of ether” (for a discussion of
this eﬀect see ref.[17, 18]). In Roentgen’s experiment, the free charges which occur
at the surface of a dielectric material submitted to an external electric ﬁeld produce
a magnetic ﬁeld when the dielectric is set into motion. A variant of the Roent-
gen experiment was proposed by Wilson. In this experiment, a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld is applied parallel to the plates of a condenser. When the dielectric is moved
4Certainly this situation is diﬀerent to the relativistic case in which the constitutive relations
(25) in S′ take a new form when is transformed to the unprimed frame S (see ref.[17]). This is
due principally to the diﬀerent hypothesis assumed: In the relativistic theory we begin from the
expression for the transformation law of B′ and H′ (for example), and then we use the relation
B′ = µH′ valid in S′ to obtain the constitutive relation in S. Here, in contrast, we begin from the
eq.(17) and then, with the constitutive relations in S and S′, we obtain the transformations for B′
and D′.

perpendicularly to the magnetic ﬁeld and parallel to the plates, the condenser is
charged.

The theory of relativity predicts a value for the surface charge density which

appears on the plates of

σrel = −γ2vH0(ǫµ − ǫ0µ0) ≃ −vH0(ǫµ − ǫ0µ0) ,

in agreement with the experimental result [18]. On the other hand, it is not diﬃcult
to see that a Galilean electrodynamics described by the equations (16) (i.e. without
transformation of the ﬁelds) predicts:

σgal = −vH0ǫµ .

In this section, we shall see that the surface charge density predicted by our
generalized electrodynamics correctly explains the Wilson eﬀect. In order to do that,
let us consider a dielectric material with dielectric constant ǫ, permeability µ and
with a velocity v (in the direction of the x axes) with respect to the two conductor
plates (ﬁxed in the frame S). Let us suppose that the external magnetic ﬁeld H0
is parallel to the plates of the condenser and perpendicular to the velocity. The
surface charge density σ which appears on the conducting plates may be calculated
in the privileged frame S. We calculate the perpendicular components of E′ and H′
outside the dielectric. As we know, these are given by the relations (17):

H ′

⊥ = a⊥H0 ,

E′

⊥ = a⊥µ0vH0 ,

D′

⊥ = ǫ0E′

⊥ = a⊥µ0ǫ0vH0 .

We can now calculate the expressions inside the dielectric material. Using the

second supplementary equation (24) in integral form (in S′):

Since the condenser plates are connected by a wire so that E⊥ = 0 and taking
into account that the surface charge density, which is computed in S′, satisﬁes the
relation σ′ = γ−1σ, we ﬁnally obtain 5

k a⊥γvH0(ǫµ − ǫ0µ0) .

Therefore, this electrodynamics is in agreement with the experiment (and with
the special relativity) if we take a−1
k a⊥ = γ. It should be noted that these values have
been obtained independently from the relation (22). In summary, we have found
the same relativistic values for the coeﬃcients of the matrix a as those proposed in
the previous section under the theoretical criterion of symmetry in our equations.

5 Conclusions

We have obtained a generalization of the classical Maxwell’s electrodynamics for
systems in (absolute) motion with respect to the privileged frame. As a main hy-
pothesis, we have assumed that the ﬁelds transform in a “similar” way (as given in
(17)) to the relativistic case, i.e. mixing electric and magnetic ﬁelds, but being pro-
portional to some coeﬃcients which are dependent on the velocity of the reference
frame.

From a theoretical point of view, we have found that the most convenient choice
of those coeﬃcients is given by ak = 1 and a⊥ = γ. These values determine the
transformation of the ﬁelds in the same relativistic form. However, as it is expected
from transformations that do not satisfy the principle of relativity, the Maxwell
equations lose their form invariance by a term depending on the absolute velocity
of the reference frame.

As a way of testing our theory, we have solved the Wilson and we have obtained
the same relativistic result if we take a−1
k a⊥ = γ, as was assumed under the theo-
retical basis of symmetry in our equations. In conclusion, historically the Wilson

experiment has been considered as one of the crucial tests to reject the ether the-
ories. However, it is interesting to note that this eﬀect may be explained into the
Galilean framework (as it should be expected from an eﬀect produced at low veloc-
ities) if certain transformation of the ﬁelds is admitted. Therefore, the property of
transformation of the ﬁelds (with γ = 1 in (17)) does not appear as a relativistic
eﬀect, but as an eﬀect of the motion with respect to the privileged frame.

Finally, it should be stressed that the aim of this work was to investigate if it
is possible to obtain an electrodynamics with diﬀerent transformation properties as
those of the relativistic theory. A previous study in this line was realized by Chang [6,
7] and by Rembieli´nski [8] who derived the Maxwell equations under the Tangherlini
transformations (in which the 4-line element is an invariant). Rembieli´nski [8, 9],
moreover, have shown that the Tangherlini transformations form a subclass of the
v-dependent transformations of the Lorentz group. As an interesting consequence,
the Maxwell equations proposed by Chang [6] are obtained by Rembieli´nski [8] by
means of this v-transformation. Thus, into this framework the absolute reference
frame and the Lorentz covariant can coexist. In contrast, the geometrical properties
of the space and time are very diﬀerent in the inertial transformations because the 4-
line element and the metric tensor are not deﬁned. This is the reason why Maxwell’s
equations in the moving frame S′ have a diﬀerent form in our formulation compared
with those obtained by Chang [6, 7] and by Rembieli´nski [8]. For example, the ﬁrst
Maxwell equation (7) and the ﬁrst supplementary equation (8) remain invariant in
ref.[6, 8] whereas these equations change in our approach. It could be interesting to
investigate other possible similarities and diﬀerences between these two frameworks.
Moreover, it is mandatory to exhibit the concordance (if any) of these theories with
other experiments. In any case, these investigations will provide an improvement in
the understanding of the electromagnetic phenomena.

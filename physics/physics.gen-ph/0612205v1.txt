Abstract

We put forward: (A) An improved description of classical, kinetic

properties of a charged pointlike physical particle that consists, in

addition to its mass and charge, also of the Eliezer and Bhabha kinetic

constants; and (B) a proposal to evaluate these kinetic constants by

considering the trajectories of charged particles in an acccelerator.

We consider classical, kinetic properties of a charged physical particle

with mass and charge concentrated around a point ~r(t) moving with velocity

~v(t) under the inﬂuence of an external force Fext(r, t). Ignoring its size, let

us approximate its behaviour by the following model.

Charged point particle. (i) The charged point particle with mass m and

charge q located at ~r(t) moves under the inﬂuence of the external force

Fext(~r(t), t). (ii) The relation between the dimensionless four-force

f(t) ≡

τ0
mc

γ(t)(cid:16)~v(t) · Fext(~r(t), t)/c, Fext(~r(t), t)(cid:17) ,

(1)

with γ(t) ≡ q1 − |~v(t)/c|2 and τ0 ≡ q2/6πǫ0mc3, and the dimensionless
four-velocity β(t) ≡ (γ, γ~v/c) is invariant under Poincar´e transformations;

(iii) The charged point particle emits four-momentum through its Lienard-

Wiechert potentials; and (iv) The relativistic diﬀerential energy-momentum

balance equation for the charged point particle reads

β(1) − (β(1) · β(1))β + B(1) = f ,

(n) ≡ (τ0γd/dt)n ,

(2)

where, generalizing Schott [1], we introduced the dimensionless acceleration
four-momentum B(t); we use the metric with signature (+ − −−), so that

β · β = 1. Now, Dirac [2] concluded that the conservation of four-momentum

(2) requires that

β · (B + β(1))(1) = 0 ,

whereas Bhabha [3] pointed out that conservation of angular four-momentum

requires that the cross product

(3)

(4)

β ∧ (B + β(1))

is a total diﬀerential with respect to proper time, cf. [6], Part II. These two
conditions point out that B is an essential part of the balance equation (2).

Relation (2) could be used as a Newtonian equation of motion for a
charged point particle, were B given only as a function of velocity nad exter-

nal force. So far no such case is known, cf. [4]. In particular, no Newtonian

equation of motion is known for an electron despite an ongoing, century-old

quest.

Asymptotic diﬀerential relation for trajectories of a charged point particle.

We put forward arguments in support of the following hypothesis [5, 6]:

When the external force depends on a non-negative parameter λ in such a

way that Fext(t, λ) = λF (λt), F (t) being an analytic function of t > 0 and
F (t ≤ 0) = 0, then in the asymptote t → ∞ the nth derivative dn~v(t)/dtn of
the particle velocity is of the order λn as λ → 0, and we may approximate
the acceleration four-momentum B up to the order of λ5 inclusive so that

the trajectory of a charged point particle satisﬁes in the asymptote t → ∞

up to the order of λ6 inclusive the following relativistic diﬀerential relation:

β(1) − (β(1) · β(1))β − β(2)

(1)

+e1hβ(2) − (β · β(2) − 1
2 β(1) · β(1))βi
+e2hβ(4) − (β · β(4) − β(1) · β(3) + 1
+b1h(β(1) · β(1))β(2) + 2(β(1) · β(2))β(1) + 7

2 β(2) · β(2))βi

(1)

4(β(1) · β(1))2βi

(1)

= f ,

(5)

where e1, e2 and b1 are real parameters. Relativistic polynomials in β(n)

multiplied by e1 and e2 were constructed by Eliezer [7], and that multiplied

by b1 is due to Bhabha [3]. So let us refer to e1 and e2 as the Eliezer constants,

and to b1 as the Bhabha constant.

Evaluation of Eliezer and Bhabha constants. So far, the Eliezer and

Bhabha constants in (5) are just parts of a model, the charged point particle.

Whether we can use them to describe classical, kinetic properties of a partic-

ular charged physical particle, supplementary to its mass and charge, could

be determined by observing accelerated trajectories of this particle. To this

end we could use particle accelerators, since they may accelerate particles

of any mass, from electrons and positrons to uranium ions: a potential use

of accelerators for considering also classical, kinetic properties of physical

particles.

Considering the kinetic properties of an electron (or positron), one might

check the Dirac assumption [2] that an electron is such a simple thing that
B = β(1); so that the Eliezer and Bhabha constants of an electron should

turn out to be negligible.

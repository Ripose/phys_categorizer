Abstract

In this paper we analyse the reasons which lead to a fuzzy space-
time approach. We then consider an experimental consequence, viz.,
a modiﬁed dispersion relation, which could be detected in ultra hligh
energy cosmic rays, by for example NASA’s GLAST Satellite sched-
uled to be launched in 2006. We also study the implications for the
theory of non-Abelian Gauge Fields.

1 Introduction

There have been two approaches to fuzzy spacetime, both motivated by the
ultra violet divergences encountered in Quantum Field Theory. The earliest
approach was that of Snyder, Schild and others (Cf.refs.[1, 2, 3, 4] and several
references therein). These authors investigated a minimum space or time
or spacetime interval or minimum cut oﬀ. This lead to what in modern
terminology is called a Noncommutative Gometry:

[x, y] = (ıa2/¯h)Lz, [t, x] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mx,

[y, z] = (ıa2/¯h)Lx, [t, y] = (ıa2/¯hc)My,
[z, x] = (ıa2/¯h)Ly, [t, z] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mz,
The relations (1) are Lorentz invariant. The novelty of (1) is that if we
retain terms ∼ (l2) where (l, τ ) represents the minimum cut oﬀ a, then the

(1)

1

coordinates x and y no longer commute. This is the origin of the fuzzyness.
The other approach has been to endow points with a structure [5, 6]. In this
approach for example, a sphere is represented by, a point, or a pair of points
(the North Pole or South Pole), or these poles together with the equator and
so on depending on the degree of approximation. In other words the points
on the sphere are ill deﬁned.
In either case we end up with relations like

[x, y] = Θıj0(xy)

(2)

Relations like (2) once again show the fuzzyness - coordinates like x and y
are represented typically by matrices and not points or real numbers.
It may be mentioned that this type of a geometry was originallyt envisaged
by Dirac himself, in phase space. Starting from the equation for the position
coordinate in the electron equation [7]

x = (c2p1H −1t) +

c¯h(α1 − cp1H −1)H −1

(3)

Dirac argued that a literal interpretation of results as in (3) would imply
that the electron has the speed of light and that the coordinates are complex,
that is represented by non-Hermitian operators. So, he pointed out that in
practise spacetime points are idealizations and really represent averages taken
over the Compton scale. Once such zitterbewegung eﬀects are eliminated
by means of these averages, we are back eﬀectively with physical spacetime.
Infact this can be seen quite clearly from the theory of the energy-momentum
(displacement) operators. In this case we have (Cf.ref.[7])

δx(dx + ¯dx) = δx2dx ¯dx = 0

(4)

In (4) it is only when the squares of the minimum intervals are neglected that
we get the usual four momentum operators - if these squared inﬁnitessimals
are retained then the operators become complex or non-Hermitian [8]. So
the momentum and hence the coordinate eigen values are complex in this
latter case.
Once we realize the purport of the imaginary parts of the coordinates, in
terms of averaging of the zitterbewegung eﬀects and introducing minimum
spacetime intervals, then we are back with the noncommutative geometry in
(1) or (2).
Indeed directly starting from (3), the Dirac complex coordinate, it can be

2

argued [9] that the noncommutative relations (1) or (2) follow, and moreover
this can be modelled by a double Weiner process.
There is however an important nuance here. Neglecting squares of inﬁnites-
simal intervals implies, not that an area is being replaced by a point, but
rather that it is being replaced by a length, viz., the minimum interval.
That is why in this approximation, the missing dimension of the area shows
up as an imaginary coordinate.
All this provides an explanation for the supposedly inexplicable reason why
the Kerr-Newman metric arises from classical considerations with an imag-
inary shift of the coordinates [10, 11, 12]. This metric or classical consider-
ations, correctly, gives the purely Quantum Mechanical g = 2 factor of the
electron. But the price that we have to pay is a singularity or a complex
horizon:

r+ =

GM
c2 + ıb, b ≡

G2Q2
c8 + a2 −

G2M 2

!

(5)

However it is remarkable that the electron coordinates given in the Quantum
Mechanical Dirac formulation, (3) and the classical Newman formulation, (5)
have the common feature that the imaginary parts are of the order of the
Compton scale while the real parts represent the position of the electron.
Indeed Newman himself was perplexed and observed [13] “... one does not
understand why it (imaginary shift of origin) works. After many years of
study I have come to the conclusion that it works simply by accident.”
The introduction of an imaginary coordinate, x → x + ıx′, can in the light of
the above remarks be seen to be the neglect of an area or an extra or inner
dimension. Indeed if we generalize to four dimensions then as is well known
we get

(1, ı) → (I, ~σ)

(6)

where σ’s represent the Pauli matrices (Cf. discussion in [9]). That is how
an imaginary shift in a four dimensional context leads to the electron spin
and the anomalous g = 2 factor, even in a classical theory. Coordinate shift
given by (6) once again lead to a noncommutative geometry like (1) or (2).
We could argue that this is the generalization that was missed out in many
complexiﬁcation schemes, and infact in Nelson’s stochastic theory, whlich
conseqently did not lead anywhere (Cf.ref.[9]).
It may be pointed out that very much in the same spirit it was argued that
we could think of inertial mass generation taking place due to what may be
called self interaction within the Compton scale [14]. Within the Compton

3

scale we have unphysical eﬀects and a breakdown of speacial relativity. This
problem was encountered nearly a century ago in the classical electron the-
ory, where the electron self mass would tend to inﬁnlity as its size shrunk
to zero. On the other hand, classically the electron could not be given a
ﬁnite size precisely because of unphysical eﬀects due to the ﬁnite size and
special relativity. The Quantum Mechanical Compton scale provides a cut
oﬀ, shielding these supposedly unphysical eﬀects [15]. Indeed what we are
doing here is something like a spacetime renormalization.
Finally it may be pointed out that [16] even in a purely classical theory of
a collection of ultra relativistic particles we come agross a two dimensional
disc of mass centres, with diameter of the order of the Compton scale, within
whlich we encounter “unphysical” eﬀects like negative energies.

2 Some Consequences

The fact that there is a minimum cut oﬀ that leads to a modiﬁcation of
special relativity and we have (c = 1 = ¯h) a modiﬁed energy momentum
relation [17]

E2 = p2 + m2 − l2p4

(7)

Alternatively an equation like (7) would follow from a lattice formulation,
but in this case, ultimately vanishing limits are taken [18].
Interestingly, it must be pointed out that modiﬁcations to Lorentz symmetry,
such as (7) have been made on an ad hoc basis, [19, 20, 21, 22] for the following
reason:
If Lorentz symmetry were exactly true then ultra high energy cosmic rays,
with energy somewhat greater than 1020eV should not reach the earth. They
would loose energy due to scatterling with the cosmic background radiation
photons. This is the GZK cut oﬀ (Cf. also ref.[17]). However, on the
contrary some twenty such events have been observed, and it is possible that
some or all of them could be attributed to a violation of Lorentz symmetry.
In any case returning to (7), if we consider particles with almost vanishing
mass m, then we conclude that there is tachyonic behavior, as if the mass
were imaginary, due to the presence of the extra term. This provides an
explanation for the violation of the GZK cut oﬀ alluded to above.
In any case the eﬀect (7) leads to a modiﬁed dispersion relation as discussed

4

in [17], for example. Infact we have, a shift in frequency given by

ǫ =

l2[Q2 + 2mQ]2
2{m + k0(1 − cosΘ)}

where Q = k0 − k, the diﬀerence between incident and scattered frequencies.
It is quite possible that these eﬀects pertaining to ultra high energy cosmic
rays at energies which cannot be reproduced in accelerators will be detected
by the GLAST Satellite to be launched by NASA in 2006.
Curiosly enough, if we were to take in (7), l2 < 0, that is if we introduce an
imaginary coordinate, then even if m2 ≈ 0, we can see that there is eﬀectively
a mass generation. This can immediately be explained by the fact alluded to
above, that mass can be thought of as arising due to self interactions within
the Compton scale, that is in the parlance of point spacetime, within this
imaginary region.
Let us now consider the implications of not neglecting the second order coor-
dinate diﬀerentials, within the context of the non-Abelian Gauge Theory. As
is well known, this could be obtained as a generalization of the usual phase
function λ to include ﬁelds with internal degrees of freedom. For example λ
could be replaced by Aµ given by

Aµ =

Aı

µ(x)Lı,

ı
X

(8)

The Gauge Field itself would be obtained by using Stoke’s Theorem and (1).
This is a very well known procedure: considering a circuit, which for simplic-
ity we can take to be a parallellogram of side dx and dy in two dimensions,
we can easily deduce the equation for the ﬁeld, viz.,

Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ − ıq[Aµ, Aν],

(9)

q being the Gauge Field coupling constant.
In (9), the second term on the right side is typical of a non Abelian Gauge
Field. In the case of the U(1) electromagnetic ﬁeld, this latter term vanishes.
Further as is well known, in a typical Lagrangian like

L = ı ¯ψγµDµψ −

F µνFµν − m ¯ψψ

(10)

D denoting the Gauge covariant derivative, there is no mass term for the
ﬁeld Bosons. Such a mass term in (10) must have the form m2AµAµ which

1

(11)

(12)

(13)

unfortunately is not Gauge invariant.
This was the shortcoming of the original Yang-Mills Gauge Theory: The
Gauge Bosons would be massless and hence the need for a symmetry break-
ing, mass generating mechanism.
The well known remedy for the above situation has been to consider, in anal-
ogy with superconductivity theory, an extra phase of a self coherent system
(Cf.ref.[23] for a simple and elegant treatment). Thus instead of the Gauge
Field Aµ, we consider a new phase adjusted Gauge Field after the symmetry
is broken

The ﬁeld Wµ now generates the mass in a self consistent manner via a Higgs
mechanism. Infact the kinetic energy term

Wµ = Aµ −

∂µφ

q

|Dµφ|2

,

|Dµφ0|2 = q2|Wµ|2|φ0|2 ,

where Dµ in (12)denotes the Gauge covariant derivative, now becomes

Equation (13) gives the mass in terms of the ground state φ0.
The whole point is as follows: The symmetry breaking of the gauge ﬁeld
manifests itself only at short length scales signifying the fact that the ﬁeld is
mediated by particles with large mass. Further the internal symmetry space
of the gauge ﬁeld is broken by an external constraint: the wave function has
an intrinsic relative phase factor which is a diﬀerent function of space time
coordinates compared to the phase change necessitated by the minimum cou-
pling requirement for a free particle with the gauge potential. This cannot
be achieved for an ordinary point like particle, but a new type of a physical
system, like the self coherent system of Superconductivity Theory now inter-
acts with the gauge ﬁeld. The second or extra term in (11) is eﬀectively an
external ﬁeld, though (13) manifests itself only in a relatively small spatial
interval. The φ or Higgs ﬁeld in (11), in analogy with the phase function of
Cooper pairs of Superconductivity Theory comes with the Landau-Ginzburg
potential V (φ).
Let us now consider in the Gauge Field transformation, an additional phase
term, f (x), this being a scalar. In the usual theory such a term can always be
gauged away in the U(1) electromagnetic group. However we now consider

6

the new situation of a noncommutative geometry referred to above,

[dxµ, dxν] = Θµνβ, β ∼ 0(l2)

(14)

where l denotes the minimum spacetime cut oﬀ. (Cf. also ref.[24, 25, 26])
(14) is infact Lorentz covariant. Then the f phase factor gives a contribution
to the second order in coordinate diﬀerentials,

[∂µBν − ∂νBµ] [dxµ, dxν]

1
2

1
2

+

[∂µBν + ∂νBµ] [dxµdxν + dxνdxµ]

(15)

where Bµ ≡ ∂µf .
As can be seen from (15) and (14), the new contribution is in the term
which contains the commutator of the coordinate diﬀerentials, and not in
the symmetric second term. Eﬀectively, remembering that Bµ arises from the
scalar phase factor, and not from the non-Abelian Gauge Field, in equation
(2) Aµ is replaced by

Aµ → Aµ + Bµ = Aµ + ∂µf

(16)

Comparing (16) with (11) we can immediately see that the eﬀect of noncom-
mutativity is precisely that of providing a new symmetry breaking term to
the Gauge Field, a term which does not come from the Gauge Field itself.
Being an 0(l2) eﬀect, it manifests itself only at small scales, as required.
Eﬀectively, because of (16) we would have, specializing to a spherically sym-
metric ﬁeld for simplicity, instead of the usual Maxwell equations in the gauge
ﬁeld context,

~E → ~E − ~∇f = ~∇Q − ~∇f

So we have for a point Gauge charge, the modiﬁed equation

The solution of (18) is

In (18) and (19) λ(r) represents the eﬀect of the noncommutativity and is
an order of l2 eﬀect, that is it falls oﬀ rapidly. It can be seen that the ﬁrst

∇2Q = −4πρ + λ(r)

Q =

Zv

(ρ + λ(r)
r

(17)

(18)

(19)

term in the integral on the right side of (19) gives, in conjunction with (17)
the usual Coulumb type of a ﬁeld. It is the second term in the integral which
represents a ﬁeld due to the noncommutativity of spacetime, which falls oﬀ
rapidly, as it vanishes at scales where order of l2 can be neglected. As such
it represents a ﬁeld mediated by massive particles.
(This is a well known example from the early days of Yang-Mills Theory,
which lead to the conclusion that there was a Coulumb type potential of
electromagnetism, that is a ﬁeld without any mass.)
On the other hand if we neglect in (14) terms ∼ l2, then there is no extra
contribution coming from (15) or (16), so that we are in the usual non-Abelian
Gauge Field theory, requiring a broken symmetry to obtain an equation like
(16). This is not surprising because if we neglect term ∼ l2 in (14) then we are
back with the usual commutative theory and the usual Quantum Mechanics.

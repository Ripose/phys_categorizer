Reexamination of Barnett’s Experiment Based on
the Modiﬁed Lorentz Force Law

Abstract – Barnett’s experiment demonstrates that the induction on a stationary cylindrical
capacitor in the presence of a rotating magnet or solenoid is zero.
In this investigation,
based on the modiﬁed Lorentz force law, which complies with Galilean transformations and
depends on relative velocities, the induction on the capacitor is reexamined. When the
rotating solenoid is long and the capacitor is placed inside the solenoid, it is seen that
the induction actually vanishes as observed in Barnett’s experiment. However, when the
capacitor is placed outside the solenoid or when the solenoid is short, it is shown that the
induction can departure from zero. This prediction provides a means to test the validity of
the modiﬁed Lorentz force law.

1. Introduction
It is known that in as early as 1831 Faraday demonstrated the unipolar induction on a
metallic wire which is rotating in the presence of a magnet, where the rotation axis is parallel
to the magnetic ﬁeld. Meanwhile, it seems that the induction is determined by the relative
motion between the wire and the magnet. Thus it is expected that a similar induction can
be observed for a stationary wire and a rotating magnet or solenoid carrying a current. In
1912 Barnett conducted experiments to justify this issue of relative motion [1]. In Barnett’s
experiment two coaxial conducting cylinders of diﬀerent radii are placed inside a solenoid
of larger radius concentrically (see Fig. 1). The two cylinders which form a capacitor are
connected to an electrometer with conducting wires. The solenoid was made to rotate about
its center axis and to carry a current. The induced electromotive force will drive charges of
opposite signs on to the two cylinders of the capacitor via the connecting wires, respectively.
By using switches which provide suitable electric insulation, the charge on the capacitor
can be measured and then the induction can be determined. However, for the case where
the solenoid is rotating and the capacitor together with the connecting wires is stationary,
the observed charge is merely a minute fraction of the expected amount, within the limits of
experimental errors [1]. Without using the switches, Kennard also tried to examine the eﬀect
of relative motion by measuring the potential diﬀerence across a similar cylindrical capacitor
placed inside or outside the concentric solenoid [2, 3]. Negative results were also reported,
except for the disturbances which were attributed to the induction when the magnetization
was reversed [3]. Thus it seems that the principle of relativity which states that physical
laws depend on relative motion is violated. On the other hand, it is argued that the principle
of relativity applies for the relative motion of translation, but not for the relative motion
of rotation. Discussions on the eﬀects of relative rotational motion on the induction still
remain active in the literature [4-6]. But this issue seems not yet solved conclusively with
quantitative analysis.

In this investigation we present a reexamination of Barnett’s experiment by resorting
to the modiﬁed Lorentz force law, which is derived from a wave equation in a quantum me-
chanical way based on the local-ether model of wave propagation [7]. This local-ether wave

1

equation in turn leads to a uniﬁed quantum theory of the gravitational and electromagnetic
forces in conjunction with the origin and identity of the gravitational and inertial mass. Fur-
thermore, this wave equation accounts for a wide variety of phenomena in modern physics,
including the Sagnac eﬀect with wave propagation, Fizeau’s experiment with moving media,
the gravitational redshift in the Pound-Rebka experiment, and the Hafele-Keating experi-
ment with fast-moving atomic clocks [7]. For quasi-static cases, the modiﬁed force law is not
new, as it can be derived from the Riemann force law which in turn has been proposed in
as early as 1861 and can reduce to the Lorentz force law under some common situations [8].
As well as the Riemann force, the modiﬁed Lorentz force law is in compliance with
Galilean transformations and can be in accord with the principle of relativity as it depends
on relative velocities. Qualitatively, these force laws immediately account for the diﬀerence
between the relative motions of rotation and translation. For two small objects, a rela-
tive motion of rotation is equivalent to a relative motion of translation at a given instant.
However, if either object is large, the situation can be diﬀerent. When the aforementioned
solenoid is rotating and the connecting wires along with the capacitor are stationary, the
relative motions between a given segment of the wires and diﬀerent segments of the solenoid
are diﬀerent in direction. This is diﬀerent from the case where the capacitor is rotating
and the solenoid is stationary, as the relative motions between a given rotating segment
and various segments of the solenoid then become identical at a given instant. Based on
the modiﬁed Lorentz force law, the vanishing induction with a rotating solenoid can be ac-
counted for without the breakdown of the principle of relativity. Further, a fundamentally
diﬀerent consequence is pointed out. That is, the induction on the stationary capacitor can
be diﬀerent from zero when the capacitor is placed outside the rotating solenoid or when
the solenoid is short in length. This prediction provides a means to test the validity of the
Riemann force law and the modiﬁed law.

2. Modiﬁed Lorentz Force Law
It is proposed that the electromagnetic force exerted on a charged particle due to various
source particles can be given in terms of the augmented scalar potential. Precisely, the
augmented scalar potential ˘Φ due to source particles of charge density ρv and experienced
by the eﬀector particle is given explicitly by the integral over a volume containing all the
source particles

where ves = |ves|, the velocity diﬀerence ves = ve − vs, ve is the velocity of the eﬀector
located at position r at instant t, vs is that of the source particles distributed at position r′
at an earlier instant t′ (= t − R/c), the propagation range R (= |r − r′|) is the distance from
the source point r′ to the ﬁeld point r, and R/c denotes the propagation delay time from
the source to the eﬀector at the respective positions and instants.

Further, it is postulated that the electromagnetic force exerted on the eﬀector of charge

q is given in terms of the augmented scalar potential by [7]

F(r, t) = q

where vei = ve · ˆı, ˆı is a unit vector, the index i = x, y, z, and the time derivative (∂/∂t)e is
referred to the eﬀector frame with respect to which the eﬀector is stationary. Physically, an
eﬀector-frame time derivative represents the time rate of change in some quantity experienced
by the eﬀector.
It is noticed that this formula resembles Lagrange’s equations adopted
by Weber, Riemann, and Thomson in the early development of electromagnetic force [9,

(1)

10]. And the augmented scalar potential resembles the velocity-dependent potential energy
introduced by Riemann [9].

Ordinarily, the magnetic force is due to a conduction current where the mobile charged
particles forming the current are actually embedded in a matrix, such as electrons in a
metal wire. The ions that constitute the matrix tend to electrically neutralize the mobile
particles and thus the conduction current is neutralized. Furthermore, the mobile source
particles drift very slowly with respect to the matrix. Thereby, as shown in [7], the proposed
electromagnetic force law (2) based on the augmented scalar potential can then be given in
terms of the electric scalar potential Φ and the magnetic vector potential A by

F(r, t) = −q∇Φ(r, t) + q∇ [vem · A(r, t)] − q

where vem is the velocity of the eﬀector particle referred speciﬁcally to the matrix which in
turn is supposed to move as a whole at a uniform velocity vm. The scalar and the vector

current density Jn respectively by the volume integrals

By using Galilean transformations the preceding force law can be given by

where the time derivative (∂A/∂t)m is referred to the matrix frame with respect to which the

the electric induction force, respectively; meanwhile, the terms q∇(vem·A) and −q(vem·∇)A
represent the magnetostatic force and the magnetic induction force, respectively. By using a
vector identity, the two force terms associated with the eﬀector velocity vem can be combined
into the magnetic force. Thus the electromagnetic force exerted on an eﬀector particle
becomes a more familiar form

According to the dependences of the force terms on vem, one is led to express the force law

and A as

B(r, t) = ∇ × A(r, t).

(10)

The electromagnetic force law under the ordinary low-speed condition represents modiﬁca-
tions of the Lorentz force law, which comply with Galilean transformations and can be in
accord with the principle of relativity as the involved velocities are relative.

The fundamental modiﬁcations are that the current density generating the potential A,
the time derivative of A in the electric induction force, and the eﬀector velocity connecting
to ∇ × A in the magnetic force are all referred speciﬁcally to the matrix frame. It is pointed
out that this particular frame has been adopted tacitly in common practice dealing with
the magnetic force, such as with the magnetic deﬂection. Further, the divergence and the
curl relations for the corresponding electric and magnetic ﬁelds are derived. Apart from
some minute deviation terms, these four relationships are just Maxwell’s equations, with the
exception that the velocity determining the involved current density and the associated time
derivatives are also referred to the matrix frame [7].

3. Electromotance
We then go on to consider the electromotance (or called electromotive force) induced on a
conducting wire in the presence of a solenoid. For a neutralized solenoid carrying a static
current, both the electrostatic force and the electric induction force vanish. Thus the force
contributes to the electromotance is the magnetic force

F = qvem × B.

For the case where the solenoid is stationary and the wire is rotating at a rate ω with respect
to the center z axis of the solenoid, the eﬀector velocity associated with the magnetic force
is vem = ˆzω × r, where r is the directed radial distance of the eﬀector from the axis. Inside
a long solenoid, the magnetic ﬁeld B is known to be uniform. Thus the electromotance V
induced on the wire C is given by

V =

where B = ˆzB0 with B0 being a constant and ra and rb are the radial distances of the
endpoints of the wire from the axis. Thus the electromotance is given by V = ω(r2
a)B0/2.
For the case where the solenoid is rotating and the conducting wire is stationary, the
velocity vem varies among the various segments around the rotating solenoid, as the matrix
velocity is no longer uniform. Consequently, the force law in terms of the vector potential
A or the magnetic ﬁeld B is not applicable. Instead, the general form of the magnetic force

should be used, where the del operator applies only on the position vector r incorporated in
R. For a thin wire C ′ carrying a conduction current I, the current density is in the direction

where the current is supposed to be static and uniform and is given by I = ρlvsm, ρl is
the line charge density of the mobile source particles (excluding the one of the neutralizing
matrix), and dl′ is parallel to vsm. The preceding formula may be diﬃcult in calculation, as
the matrix velocity and hence vem are not ﬁxed.

A simpler formula for electromotance can be obtained directly from the force law (3).
Consider the electromotance induced on a conducting wire C due to a linear short element
of a conduction current and of directed length l′. Thus (3) leads to

V =

(vem · l′)∇

µ0I
4π (Z

R (cid:19)
where R incorporated in the time derivative is varying with time whenever there is a relative
motion between the wire and the current element and thus the time derivative is really
associated with a quantity experienced by the eﬀector on the wire. It is noted that for a
linear short wire of directed length l,

The derivative dl/dt in turn corresponds to a rotation or deformation and is equal to the
diﬀerence of velocity between the endpoints of the wire. The sum (designated as K) of the
ﬁrst integral in (16) and the last term in (17) can be given by

K = ˜v · l′

Ra (cid:19)
where va and vb denote the velocities of the endpoints a and b of the wire with respect to
the current element, respectively, Ra and Rb are their distances from this element, and ˜v or
˜R denotes a suitable mean value (say, the arithmetic average) between the endpoints. Then
it is easy to show that when the directed length l approaches zero, one has

with vem is primarily due to the magnetostatic force and the other is primarily due to the
induction force.

Like the work done by a conservative force, the electromotance due to the magnetostatic
force depends on the positions of the endpoints and not on the shape of the path connecting
them. For a closed wire C, this term tends to vanish and thus the electromotance reduces
to

V = −

(23)

S

where S denotes the surface enclosed by the loop C, ds is in the direction normal to the
surface, and the magnetic ﬁeld is still related to the magnetic vector potential by (10), in
spite of the matrix velocity being nonuniform. This formula looks like the one which is
commonly cited to be related to Faraday’s law of induction [11]. However, it is of essence
to note that owing to the incorporation of the term dl/dt in (17), the time derivative in the
preceding formula then operates on dl or ds and thus a rotation or deformation along with
a translation of the loop contributes to the electromotance, as well as the time variation of
A or B itself does.

Then consider the electromotance induced on a cylindrical capacitor in the presence of a
solenoid C ′ of circular shape and carrying a uniform current I. Thus the resulting potential
A is azimuthally symmetric. When either the solenoid or the capacitor is or both of them
are rotating about the center axis of the solenoid, the integral of A in (21) is invariant with
respect to time. Thereby, the electromotance becomes an even simpler form

where a and b denote two given points on the inner and outer cylinders, respectively, as
depicted in Fig. 1. The actual path C implicitly associated with the preceding formula
starts from point a and then traverses part of the inner cylinder, the connecting wires, and
part of the outer cylinder, and ﬁnally comes to point b. However, since this electromotance
does not diﬀerentiate the paths connecting the two endpoints, the electromotance over the
actual path is then identical to the one over a complementary path connecting a to b directly
via the space between the two cylinders. For the case where the solenoid is rotating and
the capacitor is stationary, the relative motions between a given constituent segment of the
actual path and diﬀerent segments of the solenoid are diﬀerent in direction. This situation
is diﬀerent from the case where the capacitor is rotating and the solenoid is stationary.

For each segment of a closely wound solenoid which is rotating, vem is along the az-
imuthal direction and dl′ is almost along it. Further, the directions of these two vectors
change in a coordinated way around the solenoid and hence the product vem·dl′ in the pre-
ceding integral is a constant. Thus, for the stationary capacitor and connecting wires, the
induced electromotance is given by

V = −

µ0r0ωIN [L(rb, zb) − L(ra, za)] ,

(25)

where ω is the rotation rate, N is the number of turns of the solenoid, r0 is its radius, ra
and za are the coordinates of the endpoint a in the cylindrical system, rb and zb are those
of b, and L denotes the contour integral of 1/R over the spiral structure of the solenoid.
Quantitatively, the dimensionless integral L can be given by

where the solenoid is supposed to be located between z1 and z2. It is seen that aside from a
scaling factor the function L is identical to the electric scalar potential due to static charges
distributed uniformly on the cylindrical surface ﬁtting the solenoid.

The distributions of L as functions of the radial distance r with z = 0 and z1 = −z2 are
shown in Fig. 2. When the solenoid is long, it is seen that the distribution of L is almost
uniform with respect to r when r < r0. Thereby, for a cylindrical capacitor placed inside a
long rotating solenoid, the electromotance can vanish, as reported widely in the literature.
On the other hand, it is of essence to note that outside the solenoid the distribution of L
departures from being uniform. Consequently, it is predicted that a nonvanishing electro-
motance will be induced on the stationary capacitor when it is placed outside the rotating
solenoid. Moreover, when the solenoid is not long, the distribution of L is nonuniform even
when r < r0. Thus a nonvanishing electromotance can also be induced on the capacitor when
it is placed inside a short solenoid. In the experiment of Kennard with an outside capacitor,
a nonvanishing electromotance was actually observed when the magnetization was reversed
[3]. However, this experiment cannot discriminate between the electromotance due to the
induction force with a time-varying current and the one due to the magnetostatic force,
which are given by the second and the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (21), respectively.
However, a key diﬀerence between them is that the contribution due to the electric induction
force occurs only at the instant of magnetization reversal and then disappears, while the one
due to the magnetostatic force remains after the reversal. Thus it is possible to separate
these two diﬀerent kinds of electromotance with some auxiliary devices such as switches.

The predicted electromotance tends to accumulate positive and negative charges respec-
tively on the two cylinders via the connecting wires. The induced charges in turn generate
the electric scalar potential. At each point on the conducting plate, another scalar potential
deﬁned as the electromotance with respect to a certain reference point can be given unam-
biguously, as the electromotance due to the magnetostatic force and given by (24) does not
diﬀerentiate the paths connecting the two points. Thereby, the distribution of charges can be
determined by using the condition that the diﬀerence between such a magnetostatic poten-
tial and the electric scalar potential is ﬁxed on the conducting plate. Thereby, an accurate
evaluation of the charge density can be given by solving a relevant equation. Meanwhile, for
a long solenoid the magnetostatic potential can be expected to be uniform longitudinally.
From Fig. 3, it is seen that for a solenoid with a length of 10 r0, the longitudinal distribution
of the L function can be fairly uniform near the center of the solenoid with |z| < r0. Then,
by neglecting the fringing eﬀect and the longitudinal variation of the magnetostatic poten-
tial, the total charge induced on either cylinder of a short capacitor is then given simply
by ±Q, where Q = V2πǫ0l/ ln (rb/ra), l is the length of the cylindrical capacitor, and V is
the electromotance between two suitable points on the respective cylinders. The amount of
the accumulated charges can be measured if suitable shielding and switches are provided,
as in Barnett’s experiment. This prediction of the nonvanishing electromotance and hence
induced charges seems not to be reported before and then provides a means to test the
validity of the modiﬁed force law.

For the case where both the solenoid and the capacitor are rotating, the situation is
a little complicated, as the wires connecting the rotating capacitor to the electrometer are
ordinarily stationary. Thus the path C implicitly associated with (24) should be divided
into segments, over each of which its velocity is continuous as required in deriving (18).
The electromotance over a stationary segment is the same as given before. Then we just
consider a segment which as well as the solenoid is rotating at the same rate ω. Obviously,
the electromotance as well as the velocity vem of this case is the sum of those of the two
cases where either the segment or the solenoid is rotating. Thus for a long solenoid the
electromotance is expected to be still given by (12) when r0 > rb > ra, and by (25) and
(26) when rb > ra > r0, where ra and rb are associated with the endpoints of the segment.
Meanwhile, the situation can be quite diﬀerent for the case with a short solenoid. Anyway,
the electromotance can be given by numerical calculation. For the corotating case, the term

7

vem·dl′ is proportional to ˆr′·(r′ − r), where ˆr′ denotes a unit vector pointing from the center
axis to the various segments of the rotating solenoid at a given instant. The electromotance
is still given by (25) with the change that L corresponds to the integral of ˆr′·(r′ − r)/R and
is then given by

L(r, z) =

The distributions of L as functions of the radial distance r with z = 0 are shown in Fig. 4. It
is seen that the numerical results agree with the preceding estimate of the electromotance.

4. Conclusion
Based on the modiﬁed Lorentz force law, which complies with Galilean transformations and
depends on the relative velocity between the eﬀector and the source particle, the electro-
motance over a conducting wire is derived. The electromotance is composed of two parts
which are due primarily to the magnetostatic force and to the induction force, respectively.
For a closed wire the electromotance becomes the time derivative of the linked magnetic ﬂux,
which is similar to the well-known formula related to Faraday’s law except that the trans-
lation, rotation, and deformation of the loop have been taken into account explicitly. This
time derivative can vanish due to some symmetry, such as in Barnett’s experiment with a
circular solenoid rotating about its center axis. Thus the electromotance reduces to the con-
tribution due to the magnetostatic force and thus depends on the relative velocity between
the eﬀector and the matrix and on the positions of the endpoints of the wire. For the case
with a long solenoid, the magnetostatic potential is uniform inside the solenoid. Thereby, the
electromotance induced on a cylindrical capacitor placed inside a rotating solenoid vanishes.
This agrees with Barnett’s experiment. However, for the case with a short solenoid or for
the case where the concentric capacitor is placed outside the solenoid, the electromotance
can be diﬀerent from zero. This prediction of nonvanishing electromotance then provides a
means to test the validity of the modiﬁed Lorentz force law.

current I and a cylindrical capacitor. The inner and outer cylinders
of the capacitor are coaxial with the solenoid and are connected to
an electrometer with conducting wires and switches (not shown). The
electromotance between point a on the inner cylinder and point b on
the outer one is concerned.

Fig. 2 Radial distribution of the L function at the center of the
solenoid (z = 0) with its length (2z2) as a parameter. The solenoid
is rotating and the capacitor is stationary.

Fig. 3 Longitudinal distribution of the L function at r = 1.2, 1.6, 2
r0. The solenoid is centered at z = 0 and of length 10 r0.

Fig. 4 Radial distribution of the L function at the center of the
solenoid. Both the solenoid and the capacitor are rotating.

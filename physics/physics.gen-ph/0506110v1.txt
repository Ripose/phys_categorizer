Abstract

Much of the twentieth century physics has considered rigid laws–
even Quantum Mechanics and Statistical Mechanics were based on
such laws. These laws operated in a smooth spacetime manifold.
However more recent approaches as in Quantum Gravity schemes or
Quantum Super String theory deal with a non diﬀerentiable spacetime
manifold. With this we have to consider the new paradigm of Dark
Energy of Zero Point Field. The picture that now emerges is that of
a universe that is “Thermodynamic”. We investigate how this can
explain phenomenon like the velocity of light and also provide tests
for experimental veriﬁcation.

1 Introduction

The Laws of Physics were considered to be rigid laws. With the advent of
Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics, a new line of thinking based
on a collection of a huge number of particles or ensembles came into being.
Now there were probabilities, even though the underlying microphysical laws
were the ﬁxed laws of physics. This lead to, what is sometimes referred to
as the Boltzmann paradox– how can there be irreversibility of time at the
macro scale, even though the underlying laws were the time reversible laws
of physics? It was only in the last century that it was realized that the
earlier ideas were based on what have been called integrable systems, which
had been ﬁrst considered by Poincare. In these systems, it was possible to
eliminate or include interactions with a suitable set of generalized coordinates

1

obtained by a suitable canonical transformation. This would correspond to
the free particle approximation in Statistical Mechanics.
However such systems were the exception rather than the rule as previously
supposed. In other words most of the real world systems were non integral–
and this would explain the paradox of time irreversibility [1].
Though Quantum theory is based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle,
it must be emphasized that the underlying equations are once again time
reversible, be they the Schrodinger equation or the Klein-Gordon and Dirac
equations. Moreover the spacetime of Quantum theory, including Quantum
Field Theory has been either Newtonian or Lorentzian, both of which deﬁne
a diﬀerentiable spacetime manifold.
More recently, such a diﬀerentiable space time manifold has been abandoned
in approaches like Quantum Super Strings or those of Quantum Gravity.
This has reslted in progress towards a uniﬁcation of gravitation with other
fundamental interactions. In this picture, spacetime is a violent “foam”. As
Wheeler put, “No prediction of space time, therefore no meaning of space
time is the verdict of the Quantum Principle. That object which is central to
all of Classical General Relaivity, the four dimensional space time geometry,
simply does not exist, except in a Classical approximation.”
Another new element that has been added to the scenario, in the past few
years is that of an underlying Dark Energy or in older language the Zero Point
Field. This has been conﬁrmed in the past few years thanks to the work of
Perlmutter, Schmidt, Kirshner and others as also the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Cf.refs.[2, 3, 4] and
Infact this was the breakthrough of the year
several references therein).
2003, of the American Association for Advancement of Science [5]. Dark
Energy or the Zero Point ﬂuctuations endue the universe with a stochastic
or Brownian character, which again ﬁnds expression in a non commutative
geometry [6].

2 The Velocity of Light

Given the above scenario, the question then arises, how can we explain the
constancy of the velocity of light? For this we ﬁrst observe that the iner-
tial mass itself can be considered to be arising from the Zero Point Field,
as demonstrated some years ago by the author and also Rueda, Hirsch and
Puthoﬀ [7, 8, 9]. In this scenario inertia is a result of the viscous resistence

2

of the Zero Point Field. So if there is no inertial mass, then there is no re-
sistence and the velocity should become inﬁnite, or in practical terms, very
large.
Infact if we start with the Langevin equation in a viscous medium [10, 11]
then as the viscosity becomes vanishingly small, it turns out that the Brow-
nian particle moves according to Newton’s ﬁrst law as if there were no force
acting on it, that is with a constant velocity. Moreover this constant velocity
is given by (Cf.refs.[10, 11]),

Let us consider (1) with minimal values of T and m, in the real world. Infact
we have the thermodynamic Beckenstein formula [12]

We consider in (2) the entire universe so that the mass M is ∼ 1055gms.
Substitution in (2) gives

c2 ≡ hv2i =

kT
m

T =

¯hc3
8πkGM

T =

104
1032 ∼ 10−28◦K

m ∼ 10−65gms

We next consider in (1),m to be the smallest possible mass. From thermo-
dynamical considerations, Landsberg has shown that this is given by [13]

The same equation (4) can also be obtained from a diﬀerent point of view,
namely the Planck scale underpinning for the universe in modern Quantum
Gravity approaches [14]. Substitution of (3) and (4) in (1) gives

hv2i =

kT
m

=

10−16 × 10−28
10−65

= 1021, i.e.

We can see from (1) and (5) that the velocity c is exactly the velocity of
light!
The question is, for how long such a particle with vanishingly small inertial
mass can maintain the constant velocity c, that is the velocity of light. Infact

v = c

the Compton time for a particle with mass given by (4) as can be easily
checked is, 1017secs, which is the age of the universe! Alternatively let us, in
the spirit of the Beckenstein formula, (2) compute the Beckenstein life time
from the well known formula

t = Θ3πe4/¯hc4m

(6)

Substitution in (6) gives us again, the age of the universe.

3 The Zero Point Field and Non Commuta-

tive Geometry

In the more recent approaches of high energy physics, the smooth space
time manifold has been replaced by a non diﬀerentiable space time. This
is linked to a minimum interval, typically the Planck scales, and as is well
known implies also a non commutative space time [15, 16, 17, 18]. Such a
non commutative space time also implies a breakdown of Lorentz symmetry
at very high energies– this is a test which will hopefully be carried out on
ultra high energy cosmic rays in the coming years (Cf. ref.[19] and references
therein). We will now discuss another simple test for the non commutative
nature of space time.

4 The Test

We ﬁrst observe that non commutativity means that simple coordinates like
x and y do not commute but rather we have relations of the type

where β ∼ l2, l being the minimum extension and Θ are matrices. The Equa-
tion (7) suggests that the coordinates also contain some type of a momentum
with a suitable dimensional factor [20, 21]:

It has been shown that

(7)

(8)

(9)

[x, y] = βΘ

′
y = h

px

h′ = l2/h

On the other hand, it has been shown by the author, Saito and others [22, 23]
that the above non commutative geometry gives rise to a magnetic ﬁeld ~B
given by

where B = | ~B|. Use of (10) with (8) and (9) gives

(10)

(11)

Bl2 = hc/e

y =

c
eB

px

Equation (11) is familiar from the theory of a particle in a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld, ﬁrst worked out by Landau [24, 25]. What happens there is, given a
uniform magnetic ﬁeld along the z axis, the particle in the classical sense
executes circles in the x, y plane with quantized energy levels given by, with
the usual notation

E = (n +

)hωB + p2

z/2m − µσB/s

(12)

2

where ωB is given by

ωB = |e|B/mc

These are the so called Landau levels. Thus the non commutative geometry
would show up as a quantization of the energy as in (12). It must be observed
that in (12) pz is itself not quantized.

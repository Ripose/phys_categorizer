Abstract

In this work X-ray propagation in micro- and nano-size capillaries has been

considered in the frame of a simple uniﬁed wave theory.

It is shown that

the diminishing of the channel sizes completely changes the mode of beam

transportation, namely, we obtain the transformation of surface channeling

in microcapillaries to bulk channeling in nanocapillaries (nanotubes).

Keywords: X-ray channeling, nanotubes, capillary optics

I. INTRODUCTION

Starting from the mid 1980s the interest for the problem of X-ray passage through capillary

systems increased, because of the development of a new technology for the manufacturing of

X-ray optics of grazing incidence [1]. Nowadays capillary optics represents a well-established

X-ray and neutron optical instrument that allows experiments to be performed quite eﬃ-

ciently on a much smaller scale than conventional X-ray devices. These optical elements

consist of hollow tapered tubes that condense neutral particles by multiple reﬂections from

the inner channel surface [2,3]. Moreover, capillary optics relies also on the ability of a

tapered and/or bent capillary channel to act as an X-ray waveguide [4], in other words, an

optical element may be considered as a whispering-gallery X-ray device.

As well known, a whispering gallery device is a multiple reﬂection one with a large number

of bounces [5]. The total subtended angular aperture of the device is determined by the

number of bounces N and the glancing angle θ, and equals 2Nθ. While the reﬂectivity of

single bounce light from a substance with the complex dielectric function ε = 1

Evaluations made by these relations have shown that the whispering galleries oﬀer high

eﬃciency with narrow band pass [6].

Application of wave theory to the radiation passage through capillary structures opens up

new prospects for the study [7–9]. As will be shown below, capillary optical systems act in

such a way that radiation propagating in channels consists of two portions: one is scattered

by the laws of ray optics, the other one is captured in bound modes by a surface potential.

Moreover, when the channel size values approach the transverse wavelength of radiation,

the bulk channeling of photons occurs similarly to the channeling of charged particles in

crystals [10]. At present, the technology of capillary system manufacturing allows structures

of the deep submicron level to be produced [11]. For example, as examined samples one

may consider the carbon nanostructures (nanocapillary systems) [12], in the fabricating of

which a big progress has been achieved in recent years [13].

A graphitic nanotube [14–16] may be considered as a small-size (nano-size) capillary. The

wall surface of it is formed by carbon atoms, the distance among which is estimated to be

2 ˚A. The typical diameter of a single nanotube is about tens of nanometers (the channel

1

÷

2

diameter / wall thickness ratio may reach two orders of magnitude), and the length of such

a structure may be of submillimeter order. All these features of the nanotube structures

result in the utilization of wave propagation theory instead of the ray approximation one,

and consequently, nanotubes may be considered as X-ray waveguides. This allows the well

known channeling theory to be applied for describing X-ray beam propagation inside these

structures [17,18].

Nanotube research has been developed rapidly over the last decade following the bulk

production of C60 and structural identiﬁcation of carbon nanotubes. The discovery of a

third carbon allotrope Buckminsterfullerene (C60) in the mid 1980s initiated and led to the

development of elongated cage-like structures (known as nanotubes) in 1990s. Since 1991

[19], there has been a lot of study on carbon nanotubes to understand their formation and

properties. In 1992, reports appeared on the bulk synthesis of nanotubes formed as an inner

core cathode deposit generated by arching graphite electrodes in an inert atmosphere. The

products exhibit diﬀerent degrees of crystallinity and various morphologies (e.g. straight,

curled, hemitoroidal, branched, spiral, helix shaped etc.).

Indeed, carbon nanotubes stick out in the ﬁeld of nanostructures, owing to their ex-

ceptional mechanical, capillarity, electronic transport and superconducting properties [20].

They are cylindrical molecules with a diameter of order 1 nm and a length of many microns.

They are made of carbon atoms and can be thought of as a graphene sheet rolled around a

cylinder [21].

It is well known that nanotubes can be manufactured of diﬀerent diameters - from a

fraction of nm up to microns, of diﬀerent length - from tens of microns up to millimeters,

of diﬀerent materials - usually carbon but also others [22]. There are various applications

of nanotubes. Recent examples include use of nanotube as (I) gas storage components for

Ar, N2 and H2 (II) STM probes and ﬁeld emission sources (III) high power electrochemical

capacitors (IV) chemical sensors (V) electronic nanoswitches (VI) magnetic storage devices

etc.

Diﬀerent carbon nanotubes have been manufactured and investigated by X-ray absorp-

3

tion near-edge structure (XANES) at the carbon K edge. The surface structure and bonding

properties have been studied by characteristic pre-edge features while structural features of

these nanostructured systems have been identiﬁed looking at the variation in the multiple-

scattering region of the XANES spectra [23].

Simulations of particle beam channeling in carbon nanotubes have been recently per-

formed, in order to evaluate the possibilities for experimental observation of channeling

eﬀects in both straight and bent nanotubes, considering diﬀerent charged particle species,

such as protons of 1.3 and 70 GeV, and positrons of 0.5 GeV [24]. There the capabilities

of a nanotube channeling technique for charged particle beam steering have been discussed,

based on earlier Monte Carlo simulations [25].

In this work a uniﬁed description for X-ray propagation (note that the same theory is

valid for neutrons) through capillaries of various diameters is presented.

II. QUANTUM-WAVE DUALISM

As it has been shown recently, the propagation of X-ray photons through capillary systems

exhibits a rather complex character [26]. Not all features shown in the experiments can be

explained within the geometrical (ray) optics approximation [27–29]. On the contrary, the

application of wave optics methods allows us to describe in details the processes of radiation

spreading into capillaries.

The propagation of X radiation through capillary systems is mainly deﬁned by its interaction

with the inner channel walls. In the ideal case, when the boundary between hollow capillary

and walls represents a smooth edge, the beam is split in two components: the mirror-reﬂected

and refracted ones. The latter appears sharply suppressed in the case of total external

reﬂection. The characteristics of scattering inside capillary structures can be evaluated from

the solution of a wave propagation equation.

In the ﬁrst order approximation, without

taking into account the roughness correction ∆ε (r) = 0 (∆ε is the perturbation in dielectric

permittivity induced by the presence of roughness), the wave equation in the transverse

Due to the fact that the transverse wave vector may be presented as k⊥ ≈

When we introduce a curvature in the reﬂecting surface, the eﬀective potential obtains an

additional contribution. This term, that corresponds to the additional ”potential energy”,

can be seen physically in the following way. Due to the reﬂecting surface curvature a photon

receives an angular momentum krcurvϕ of the ”centripetal force”, where rcurv is a curvature

radius of the photon trajectory. The latter is supplied by the ”centrifugal potential energy”

The situation is explained in the scheme in Fig. 1. Because of the variation in the spatial

system parameters, the interaction potential has been changed from the step potential with

the potential barrier of k2δ0 to the well potential, with the depth and width deﬁned by the

channel characteristics.

In the following we brieﬂy discuss a solution of the wave equation in the case of an ideal

reﬂecting surface (i.e. without roughness), when the reﬂected beam is basically determined

by the coherently scattered part of radiation (for details see Refs. [30,31]). The evaluation

of the wave equation with the boundary conditions of a capillary channel shows that X-

radiation may be distributed over the bound state modes deﬁned by the capillary channel

5

potential (see below). It is important to underline here that the channel potential acts as an

eﬀective specular reﬂecting barrier, and then, the eﬀective transmission of X-radiation by

the hollow capillary tubes is observed. While the main portion of radiation undergoes the

incoherent diﬀuse scattering, the remaining contribution (usually small) is due to coherent

scattering that represents a special phenomenon, extremely interesting to observe and clarify

[33].

Let us estimate the upper limit of curvature radius (rcurv)m (which is deﬁned by capil-

lary/system of capillaries bending), at which the wave behaviors are displayed under propa-

gation of radiation in channels [7], by considering a photon with the wave vector k channeling

into capillary with curvature radius (rcurv)i (i-th layer of capillaries). At small glancing an-

gles, θ, the change of the longitudinal wave vector, k||, under reﬂection from a capillary wall

is negligibly small; but mainly one changes the transverse wave vector, k⊥,

Correspondingly, from this relation it follows that the transverse wavelength will much

exceed the longitudinal wavelength that provides the interference eﬀects to be observable

even for very short wavelengths. Indeed,

quantum mechanical principles say that, in order to display the wave properties of a chan-

neling photon, it is necessary that typical sizes of an ”eﬀective channel” δi , in which waves

have been propagating, be commensurable with the transverse wavelength, i.e. δi(θ)

(Fig. 2). This condition may be rewritten in the following form:

III. PROPAGATION EQUATION

A. Surface channeling

Since the waveguide is a hollow cylindric tube, if the absorption is considered to be negli-

gible, the interaction potential, in which a wave propagates, is determined by Eq.(5) with

the radiation polarizability parameter δ0 ≃
interested in the surface propagation, which, in fact, deﬁnes a wave guiding character inside

where Aim(x) is the Airy function, and α is the arbitrary unit characterizing the capillary

substance. Evidently, these expressions are valid only for the lower-order modes and in the

vicinity of a channel surface. The expression (9) characterizes the waves that propagate close

to the waveguide wall, or in other words, the equation describes the grazing modal structure

of the electromagnetic ﬁeld inside a capillary (surface bound X-ray channeling states) (Fig.

3). The solution shows also that the wave functions are damped both inside the channel

wall and going from the wall towards the center.

It should be underlined here that the

bound modal propagation takes place without the wave front distortion. The analysis of

these expressions allows us also to conclude that almost all radiation power is concentrated

in the hollow region and, as a consequence, a small attenuation along the waveguide walls

is observed.

As for the supported modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, estimating a characteristic radial

size of the main grazing mode (m = 0) results in

and we can conclude that the typical radial size u0 may overcome the wavelength λ, whereas

the curvature radius r1 in the trajectory plane exceeds the inner channel radius, r0: u0 ≫
(for example, u0 & 0.1 µm for a capillary channel with the radius r0 = 10 µm).

B. Bulk channeling

Above we have considered the transmission of X-ray beams by capillary systems of micron-

and submicron-size channels. Obviously, in that case we deal with surface channeling of

radiation due to the fact that the channel sizes are larger than the radiation wavelength

at least by three orders of magnitude. However, the situation sharply varies in the case

when the sizes of channels become comparable with the radiation wavelength. In practice it

means, that the angle of diﬀraction for the given wave, determined as θd = λ/d (being d a

capillary diameter), becomes comparable with a critical angle of total external reﬂection. In

other words, the transverse wavelength of a photon approaches the diameter of a capillary:

λ⊥/d

∼

1. In this case channeling of photons (note, not superﬁcial (surface) channeling!)

in channels of capillary systems should occur, i.e. we actually deal with a X-ray waveguide

optics similar to a light waveguide one. Under the condition of the ordering channels in the

system cross section, the capillary nanostructures are similar to crystals in relation to the

charged particles, ﬂying by under small angles to the main crystallographic directions.

As the analysis of the wave equation shows, the task cannot be analytically resolved for the

real nanotube potential. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the problem in the radial

approximation for the periodic ﬁeld of a multilayer waveguide with the size d0 of a central

channel and the distance d between the layers composing a waveguide wall. An interaction

potential of the radiation in such a waveguide system may be presented as follows:

can be expanded in terms of them. Then, we have a wave function E(r) at a particular

instant in time that obeys the continuous boundary conditions at the walls. In other words,

nd. In this case we see that the Eqs.(14) may be solved only for

even modes. However, it is more important to underline that the even mode exists for any

e

ratio between the channel size and the layer distance. The spatial distribution of the mode

has a maximum at the centre of the channel, and due to the leak through the potential

barrier of wall layers we observe the propagation of radiation in substance. The radiation

intensity for the successive layer decreases following an exponential law and is characterized

by a local maximum far from the layer wall (the radial wave function distribution for the

case of quasidistant layer system is shown in Fig. 4).

Because of the small wall thicknesses of nanotube channels (less than λ⊥ . 100 ˚A) we have

to note that part of the radiation, channeling inside a nanotube structure, will undergo ”tun-

neling” through the potential wall barrier. A simple analysis of the radiation propagation in

systems both for the case of macroscopic channel and for the case of totally isotropic spatial

structure, shows the presence of the main channeling mode (the main bound state) for any

structure, whereas the high modes may be suppressed for speciﬁc channel sizes. Hence,

nanotubes present a special interest as waveguides, which allow the supported modes to be

governed. Moreover, there is a special interest in studying the dispersion of radiation in a

nanosystem with a multilayered wall. As follows from the analysis of the general equation of

radiation propagation considered above, at any correlation between the channel size and the

interlayer distance at least one mode (bound state) should be formed in such a structure.

In that case the diﬀraction of waves reﬂected from various layers of the channel wall should

be observed, hence aﬀecting the radiation distribution at the exit of system.

Evidently, the eﬃciency of these structures for applications have to be analyzed, despite the

importance of the nanotube X-ray waveguide phenomenon from the fundamental point of

view. The problems associated with X-ray and neutron channeling in capillary nanotubes

(single- and multi-wall systems) present a special interest and will be analyzed in a subse-

quent paper.

IV. CONCLUSION

The reduction in the channel size of capillary structures, as well as the discovery of a new

class of natural nanosystems - i.e. carbon nanotubes - puts the problem of passage of X-ray

quanta through these systems on a new qualitative level.

In the present work the general uniﬁed theory, allowing us to describe processes of radiation

passage through capillary systems in a wide range of channel diameters, is oﬀered. Our

analysis shows, that in the case of micron diameters the surface channeling of quanta presents

in the mechanism of propagation (the part of radiation is distributed, being trapped by the

bent surface of the channel), that can inﬂuence essentially the angular radiation distribution

behind capillary systems. A decrease in size up to the nano-level results in a transition from

surface channeling to bulk channeling. Thus, all radiation is involved in the process of the

modal propagation, as opposed to the surface channeling when only part of the radiation is

subject to the bound spreading.

2θc ≃
experimental (FWHMSR

Recently, it has been demonstrated that for speciﬁc cases a decrease in the angular divergence

of X radiation after passing through capillary systems may be observed [34]. We have

found strong diﬀerences between the observed and expected FWHM (full width at half

maximum) values. From the general ray approach estimations, a FWHM value of at least

0.9◦ for 4 keV synchrotron radiation photons is expected. This width exceeds both the

exp[4 keV] = 0.28◦) and Gaussian ﬁtted (FWHMSR

G [4 keV] = 0.22◦)

values. An analogous feature takes place also in the case of harder radiation. Such a behavior

indicates an essential redistribution of radiation scattered inside the channels. The obtained

discrepancy in experimental and theoretical results is not reproduced within the framework

of the ray approximation and may be explained using the wave approach method, in order

to describe the angular distribution of the reﬂected beam.

The discovery of a new class of ordered systems like nanostructures (fullerenes, nanotubes)

opens up interesting opportunities for studying coherent eﬀects of the radiation interacting

with nanosystems. The interest is not limited to fundamental research, on the contrary, there

11

is a big potential for using the nanosystem samples, in order to develop new technological

ideas (nanotube benders, nanosystem detectors, nanosystems as a source of electromagnetic

radiation, nanotube undulators, etc.). For instance, recently new types of undulators for

new generations of X-ray sources (FEL) have been studied, based on the manufacturing of

a crystal undulator obtained by making a periodic series of micro trenches on the crystal

surface (stripe distortion potential) [35], a research that which might result in the future

creation of undulators based on nanostructures.

The main purpose of the present work is fundamental - i.e. to study the processes accom-

panying the X-ray transmission by capillary structures - in spite of the fact that capillary

optics applications are covering larger and larger areas in X-ray physics and chemistry,

biology and medicine. X-ray and neutron research activities over the last ten years demon-

strated that capillary optics is a powerful instrument to guide neutral particle beams. Cap-

illary/polycapillary optics can be applied in numerous branches of X-ray research, e.g. spec-

troscopy, ﬂuorescence analysis, crystallography, imaging technics, tomography, lithography,

etc. [11].

the model potential (C.).

Figure 2: Illustration of X-ray reﬂection from the inner capillary surface. At glancing

angles θ, when the cross size of a beam δi(θ) becomes comparable with the transverse

wavelength λ⊥(θ), the radiation is grasped in a mode of surface channeling.

Figure 3: The radial distributions of the main bound mode of radiation inside a capillary

channel for various channel diameters. The decrease of diameter (2r0) results in a spatial

displacement of the distribution away from the channel wall towards the center. The wall

surface position is shown by the dotted line.

Figure 4: The typical radial wave function distribution for a periodic multilayer waveg-

uide, where d is the distance between the layers composing a waveguide wall.

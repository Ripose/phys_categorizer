Abstract

We show how, a non commutative underpinning for spacetime
throws up mass, spin and charge and indicate how it is possible to
include QCD eﬀects also.

1 Introduction

In a previous communication[1] it was suggested that if we consider a non
commutative geometrical underpinnilng to the usual spacetime given by
equation

[x, y] = 0(l2)
[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2
x];
[t, pt] = ı¯h[1 − (a/¯hc)2p2
t ];
[x, py] = [y, px] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpy;
[x, pt] = c2[px,t] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpt; etc.

Then it is possible to obtain a uniﬁed formulation for electromagnetism and
gravitation. Infact it was shown that using (1), we can deduce that

where Aµ is the electromagnetic four potential and Γµv
fel symbols.

Aµ = ¯hΓµv

(2)

Equation (2) provides a link between electromagnetism and gravitation, and
infact is mathematically identical to Weyl’s original uniﬁed formalism[2], ex-
cept that in our case it arises due to spacetime properties given by (1), and
is not adhoc as in the former case.
It may be mentioned that the relations (1) arise when there is a minimum non
zero spacetime interval l and τ = l/c, as was demonstrated several decades
ago by Snyder[3]. Such considerations, once rejected are now back in the
reckoning, for example in the Quantum Superstring theory where also we
have extended particles and the above non commutative geometry[4].
Let us now pursue the above line of thought a little further.

2 Mass, Spin and Charge

Our starting point is the formula for the metric in ﬂat spacetime

If we use in (3) the relation (1), after rewriting the product of the coordinate
diﬀerentials as a sum of symmetric and anti symmetric terms, we will get

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν

gµν = ηµν + khµν

(3)

(4)

The ﬁrst term in (4) denotes the usual ﬂat spacetime metric while the second
term which represents a departure from ﬂat spacetime denotes the eﬀect of
non commutativity, k being a suitable constant.
It is interesting to note that such a symmetric-anti symmetric combination
for the coordinate diﬀerentials is similar to that of torsional theories[5], with
however the important diﬀerence that in torsional theories the contribution to
the spacetime interval from the anti symmetric term vanishes, where as here,
in view of (1) there is a non zero contribution. This again is because due to
the non commutative geometry, the spacetime points of conventional theory
are ruled out. It must also be noted that if 0(l2) and 0(τ 2) are neglected in
(1) then we are back again with conventional spacetime.
We next observe that starting from (4) and remembering that the second
term is small as l and τ are small, we can with standard arguments (Cf.[6])
deduce the linearized general relativistic equation.

− ηµν∂λ∂λh + ηµν∂λ∂σhλσ = −kT µν

where the term on the right side of (5) arises because of the fact that

goes over

to

∂
∂xλ Γν

µν −

∂
∂xµ Γν

λν

which now does not vanish due to the non commutativity.
It can further be shown that using the usual gauge (Cf.[6]), in view of (2) we
now have

Also introducing the notation

Equation (5) can be rewritten as

∂µhµν = Aν

φµν = hµν −

ηµνh

2φµν = −kT µν

It is interesting to note that operating on both sides of (7) with ∂µ, we get in
view of (6) Maxwell’s equations. Equation (7) describes the spin 2 graviton
while the Maxwell equations lead to the spin 1 photon.
We now observe that given equation (5) or (7), as is well known in the
linearized theory (Cf. also[7]) we have, taking for simplicity k = 1,

hµv =

Z

4Tµv(t − |~x − ~x′|, ~x′)
|~x − ~x′|

d3x′

It must be mentioned that equation (8) is valid outside the Schwarzchild
radius, which in any case is the region of our interest. Further velocities
comprable to the velocity of light are allowed and the stresses T jk and mo-
mentum densities T 0j can be comparable to the energy momentum density
T 00. It can be easily deduced that when |~x′|
r << 1, where r ≡ |~x|, and in
a frame with origin at the centre of mass and at rest with respect to the
particle, and in units in which the Gravitational constant is unity,

where m is the mass (or approximate mass because of the linear approxi-
mation), and Sk is the angular momentum (Cf.ref.[7] for details). We next
observe that,

T µv = ρuµuv
As can be seen from (1), l and τ are the minimum spacetime intervals which
we take to be at the Compton scale, the Planck scale being a special case for
the Planck mass ∼ 10−5gms. The reason for this is that while the Compton
scale is the ”size” of elementary particles, as is well known, even in classical
physics, this is the limiting case within which we encounter unphysical neg-
ative energies, exactly as in Quantum Theory[8]. We also use the input that
at the Compton scale, the velocity uı = c the velocity of light while u0 = 1.
Substitution of (11) in (10) now gives, on using the mean value theorem

(11)

(13)

As l ∼ ¯h/2mc the Compton wavelength, we get from (12) on using (9),

Sk = c < xl >

ρd3x

Z

Sk = ¯h/2

as required for a Fermion.
It is known that the gravitational potential is easily obtained from (8) and
(9) and is given by

Φ = −

(g00 − η00) = −

(Cf.[6, 7]).
Interestingly, what we have shown is that the particle has mass, spin and
charge, and can be described by the Kerr-Newman metric including the oth-
erwise purely Quantum Mechanical anomalous gyromagnetic ratio, g = 2.
For the electron, such a description throws up a singularity, which however is
shielded by the above unphysical negative energy region within the Compton
scale (Cf.[8]). This again is symptomatic of the breakdown of the concept of
spacetime points, leading to non commutative geometry.
It is also possible to obtain the electromagnetic ﬁeld from the above by an
alternative method which also enables us to describe QCD eﬀects.
Infact
using (2) and (8) we get

A0 ∼

All this has been worked out in detail (Cf.refs.[8, 9]).
Infact if we revert to the usual units, we recover from (15) the well known
electrostatic potential with the well known ratio

Gm2 ∼ 1040

It is interesting that the same line of argument also leads to the QCD type
of interaction. To see this simply if we expand equation (8) in terms of a
Taylor series about t, and this time consider the case where |~x| ∼ |~x′|, we get

hµv = 4

β being a constant and M being the mass of the particle. (17) already re-
sembles the QCD quark potential[10] with both the Coulombic and conﬁning
parts. Taking for M the mass of a typical C quark ∼ 1.8Gev, the ratio of the
coeﬃcients of the r term and the 1
¯h2 (Gev)2
as in the case of QCD[10].
These considerations can be reﬁned further (Cf.ref.[11, 12, 13]) and infact we
are able to get not only a characterisation of a QCD potential but also an
explanation for the peculiar characteristics of quarks such as their one third
fractional charge and their handedness.

r term as obtained from (17) is ∼ 1

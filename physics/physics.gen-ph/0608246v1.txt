A non-native English speaking physics professor formulates obvious yet useful rules for writing

research papers.

I.

INTRODUCTION

There are many volumes written about technical writ-
ing, and I probably do not have too much original mate-
rial to add to them. Yet, whenever a student brings me
a draft of their ﬁrst research paper, I invariably see an
almost universal set of problems. Some of these probably
stem from the way writing is taught at schools. As an
example, at school we are taught to enrich our writing
by avoiding repeating the same term and using synonyms
instead. Unfortunately, if one is writing a scientiﬁc pa-
per, using diﬀerent words for the same object could be a
disaster.

Hoping that these notes will actually be read, let us,

without further ado, present

• Sentences cannot start with an abbreviation [e.g.,

Fig. 1 or Eq. (2)], or with “So” or “Also.”

• It is usually better to use past indeﬁnite tense, for
example “it was found” (as opposed to present or
past perfect – “it has or had been found”), unless
necessary.

• Saying “This was demonstrated by J. Doe (1905)”
is correct, while saying “This was demonstrated in
J. Doe (1905)” is not.

• Things to be compared shall be presented in a sim-
ilar manner (for example, on graphs with the same
scale).

• This one is a must: read the ﬁnished manuscript!

II. THE RULES

III. CONCLUSION

• A wise man said: “If you can abstain from writing

– do not write!”

works miracles!

• “When in doubt – cross it out.” Try it; it really

• The contents of a section should match its title.

• An equation appearing in the text should never be
presented without comment, unless it is an inter-
mediate step in a derivation.

• All “letters” (i.e., variables and constants) appear-
ing in equations should be explicitly deﬁned, even
if seemingly obvious.

• All references, ﬁgures, tables, and equations should

be numbered in order of appearance.

These rules are quite obvious and “common sense.”
Yet, formulating them explicitly and keeping them in
mind while writing could, hopefully, be useful. It goes
without saying, that as with most rules, there may be
exceptions.

Do we follow our own advice? Judge for yourself by
checking out some of the recent published work of our
group at http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~budker/.

Acknowledgment

I am grateful to all of my present and and former stu-
dents and co-authors, and, particularly, to Derek F. Jack-
son Kimball (now a Professor at California State Univer-
sity, East Bay) for making these rules so apparent.

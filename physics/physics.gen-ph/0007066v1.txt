The standard big bang cosmology has been greatly suc-
cessful in explaining many observational aspects of the real
universe. However, two particular diﬀﬁculties faced by it are
the so-called “horizon” and “ﬂatness” problems. By assuming
that the recently found cosmic acceleration to be a genuine
and ever present eﬀect, we show that, the resultant modiﬁed
Friedman model is free from both the above referred problems,
and there is no need to invoke the additional “inﬂationary”
initial phase as a seperate ingredient. The important cosmo-
logical milestones of the standard big babg cosmology (which
predicts cosmic deceleration) like GUT symmetry breaking
epoch or radiation matter decoupling epoch may remain more
or less unchanged in the modiﬁed cosmology in terms of red-
shift values. However, in terms of cosmic time t, all such
epochs occur earlier as the universe becomes older in this
case.

I. INTRODUCTION

Only a few years ago, it was believed that the uni-
verse is undergoing a declerated expansion (DE). Then it
was felt that there is no compelling reason to retain the
“cosmological constant” term, Λ, in the Einstein equa-
tions describing the evolution of the universe.
In such
a case, it followed that, the behaviour of the universe
ﬁlled with matter and radiation, could be broadly de-
scribed as S(t) = αtn, where n < 1 and α is a constant
of proportionality [1,2]. For instance, for the early radia-
tion dominated era, one has S ∼ t1/2 and for the matter
dominated universe, S ∼ t2/3 (for a closed universe with
curvature parameter k = 0).

However, over the past few years, studies of luminosity-
distance studies involving type supernova I, have sug-
gested that the universe is undergoing accelerated ex-
pansion (AE). Such AE is possible either due to presence
of a Λ term or because of the presence of a quintessence
[3]. The simplest way to broadly reprsent the AE would
be to write

S(t) = αtn;

n > 1

(1)

In the past era of supposed decelerated expansion, one
would encounter the socalled horizon and ﬂatness puzzle.
In the former case, it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd an answer asto
why the universe is so isotropic and homogeneous if the
universe comprised causally disconnected tiny patches in
the very early era.
In the latter case, one has to ex-
plain why the quantity | Ω − 1 |∼ O1 in the present
epoch unless Ω was extremely ﬁne tuned to unity in the
early past. Here Ω is the ratio of the actual density of
the universe (u to the critical density needed to close the
universeuc = 8πG/3H 2, where H is the Hubble constant.
To remedy such problems, in the framework of the sup-
posed (incorrect) decelerated expansion, one needed to
introduce, in a fairly ad hoc manner, a brief spell of sud-
den exponential expansion by a factor of ∼ 1030 starting
from t ≈ 10−35 s.
It is this rapid expansion which is
supposed to to bring distant regions within the sphere
of causality and simultaneously ﬂattening the universe
[2–5]. Following this brief infalationary period, the uni-
verse is supposed to revert back to the original decel-
erated expansion mode in a manner which is harly well
understood.

However, we shall show below that once we accept the
fact the universe is undergoing AE rather than DE and

assume that it was so in the past too, there is no need
to posulate an ad hoc inﬂationary phase alteast for the
purpose of solving the horizon or ﬂatness problems.

II. REMOVAL OF HORIZON PROBLEM

The range of the causal horizon is deﬁned as

dH = S(t)Z t

0

dt′
S(t′)

(2)

Using Eq. (1) we see that

Ω1 − 1 = O(0)(Ω2 − 1)

(10)

So in the present universe, we should not only have
| Ω1 − 1 |∼ O(1), but, we should actually have Ω1 =
Ωmatter + ΩΛ → 1. Then there is no ﬂatness problem,
and on the other hand, the universe should be completely
ﬂat at any appreciable value of t.
In fact very recent
observations indeed show that this is precisely the case
[6].

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The age of the universe in the present case could be

(3)

ﬁnite. This can be seen in the following simple way:

t = Z dS
˙S

By using Eq. (7), we see that

t =

S1/n

α

(11)

(12)

In contrast there could be more involved models incorpo-
rating AE for which one may have t = ∞ for S 6= 0. In
other words there could be singularity free models for
which horizon and ﬂatness problems naturally do not
arise [7]. However, we found that in a more orthodox
model of AE with a ﬁnite age of the universe, horizon
and ﬂatness problems cease to exist and, thus, there is
no need to postulate, in an adhoc manner the occurrence
of a brief spell of inﬂation. It can be shown that even if
the horizon and ﬂatness problems disappear with the idea
of inﬂation in the present epoch, in principle, they may
reappear, in future if k 6= 0 and the universe were un-
dergoing DE [8,9]. On the other hand, such problems do
no recur for the present simple model incorporating AE.
And although, the singularity and a hot early epoch lie
in a ﬁnite past, in the present simple case of an orthodox
model, note that the universe begins with a “whimper”
( ˙S = 0 inﬁnity) rather than a “bang”( ˙S = ∞).

We have of course, not suggested any physics which
may be driving the universe in the AE mode. This a
completely diﬀerent problem in its own right and many
authors are addressing to it. We would simply mention
here that it is possible to have practically any form of
a time varying Λ and consequent desired evolution [10].
And if we consider the AE occuring due to a Λ term,
which is intrinsic to the fabric of spacetime, the pres-
ence of such a term may not signiﬁcantly alter the local
thermodynamics. Thus the relationship between S or z
and temperature could be unaltered in such a scheme. In
other words, as an example, the epoch of decoupling may
still be at z ≈ 1100 as in the standard Λ-free cosmology.
However the S(t) or z and t will change. Consequently
the epoch of decoupling will lie at diﬀerent model depen-
dent cosmic time.

For n > 1, the above integral blows up and there is no
horzon problem.

III. FLATNESS PROBLEM

In the presence of the cosmological term, the relation-
ship between present density u, Hubble constant H, and
scale size S is [2]

H 2 +

K
S2 =

8πGu

+

Λc2

Dividing both sides by H 2, we have

1 +

K
H 2S2 = Ω +

Ω − 1 =

k

H 2S2 −

Λc2
3H 2

Or,

Here note that

(6)

˙S = nαtβ;

β = n − 1 > 0;

H =

S

= n/t

(7)

Using the foregoing relationships, we ﬁnd from Eq. (6)
that for the present epoch t = t1 and for the past epoch
t = t2

Ω1 − 1
Ω2 − 1

=

kα−2t−2β
kα−2t−2β

1 − Λ1t2

2 − Λ2t2

(8)

As t2 → 0, the second term in the denominator of the
above equation → 0, and we obtain

Ω1 − 1
Ω2 − 1

= (cid:18) t1

t2(cid:19)−2β

−(cid:18) Λ1

Λ2(cid:19) t2

1t2β

(9)

Again as t2 → 0, both the terms on the RHS of the
foregoing equation → 0 if Λ varies less sharply than t−2.
Therefore, we ﬁnd that

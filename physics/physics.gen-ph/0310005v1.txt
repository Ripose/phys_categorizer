Abstract

The recent measurement by Bignami and co-workers of the mag-
netic ﬁeld of a neutron star for the ﬁrst time gives a value that diﬀers
by about two orders of magnitude from the expected value. The spec-
ulation has been that the nuclear matter in the neutron stars exhibits
In this note we argue that this exotic be-
some exotic behaviour.
haviour is an anomalous statistics obeyed by the neutrons, and more-
over these considerations lead to a value of the magnetic ﬁeld that
agrees with the observation. The same considerations also correctly
give the magnetic ﬁelds of the earth and Jupiter.

Very recently Bignami and co-workers have been able to observe the magnetic
ﬁeld of an isolated neutron star for the ﬁrst time1 and get the value 8
1010
Gauss, which diﬀers by a few orders of magnitude from the expected value2.
We would like to draw attention to the fact that infact the value just observed
was deduced on the basis of the anomalous statistics obeyed by the neutrons
in neutron stars, which behave as a degenerate Fermi gas3,4,5.
The anomalous statistics arises due to the fact that, as is well known, the
energy density e at sub Fermi temperatures is given by

we can see that the assembly of neutrons behaves with the fractal dimen-
sionality 1.5, leading to the anomalous semionic statistics.
On the other hand if we consider an assembly of N spin half particles, it is
known that N+ denoting the number of spin up particles, the magnetization
per unit volume is given by

The point is that at low temperatures with usual dimensionality, there are

then shows that the magnetization is negligible. On the other hand if the
assembly behaved according to Bose-Einstein statistics, then there would be
a large magnetization because all particles would align with their spins, that
is eﬀectively N+
When we have the anomalous statistics due to the fractional dimensionality,
then we would have instead

Equations (2) and (3) are quite general - they hold for Fermi gases at sub
Fermi temperatures. Infact, in a completely diﬀerent context, for the earth
core, they give the correct geomagnetic ﬁeld4,8. In this case the Fermi tem-
perature can be easily calculated to be 105 degrees centigrade, well above the
1048 atoms (mostly iron) in the
core temperature. Further there are N
inner core and we get on using (2) and (3) the correct geomagnetic strength
of about 1 Gauss.
Let us consider the magnetic ﬁeld of Jupiter. Remembering that the core
density of Jupiter is of the same order as that of the earth, while the core
volume is about 104 times that of the earth, we have N
1052, so that the

In the case of neutron stars we know that the number density N

the Fermi temperature. Whence using (3) in (2), we get the magnetization

104 times the earth’s magnetism, as required.

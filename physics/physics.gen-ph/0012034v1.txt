Abstract

It is pointed that we now actually have no enough proofs to prove that time reversal symmetry is
universally obeyed in the processes of particle interactions. The analyses show that the time reversal
symmetry is obviously violated at least in the processes of particle’s decays, especially in the processes
of strange particle’s decays, and some resonance states with only one middle resonance particle to
appear, as well as particle pair’s annihilations. So the phenomena of violating time reversal symmetry
may exist commonly in the particle’s interactions.

PACS number: 1130
According to the current viewpoint, except a few cases of K 0 particle decays, time reversal symme-
try is considered universally tenable in the interaction processes of micro-particles. However, it should
be pointed out that only a few experiments show the symmetry of time reversal with low precision
at present. Corresponding to so many processes of particle interactions, it is not enough for us to
consider the symmetry of time reversal as a commonly obeyed law in the particle physics. The real
situations may not be as what we believe now. It can be pointed out that the time reversal symmetry
is obviously violated at least in the processes particle’s decays, especially in strange particle’s decays,
and some resonance state with only one middle resonance particle to appear, as well as particle pair’s
annihilations. So we have to re-examine the conclusion about time reversal symmetry. We only discuss
the experimental problems in this paper and will discuss the theoretical problems in the paper titled
” Time reversal symmetry not exist actually in the theories of particle interactions”.

In order to discuss the problems strictly, we ﬁrst deﬁne and classify the processes of time reversals.
The processes can be classiﬁed as both the determinative and the statistical processes of time reversals.

1.The determinative processes of time reversals

The determinative processes of time reversals can still be divided into both the determinately

reversible processes and determinately irreversible processes

In the determinative processes, let particles A and B collide each other, then C and D particles
are certainly produced. The determinately reversible process of time reversal of A + B
C + D is
deﬁned as follows. When the velocities of the particles C and D are reversed accurately, they would
move along the completely same paths as in the positive process so that they would collide to each
other. Then particles A and B would be certainly produced again. After that, A and B particles
would also move along the completely same paths as they do in the positive process and then apart
each other. These processes are called as the determinately reversible processes of time reversals. If
they can not do so, the process is called as the determinately irreversible proces of time reversal. The
concept of the determinately reversible or irreversible process of time reversal is meaningful for the
process of a single particle’s decay, so it is also meaningful for a system composed of a large number
of particles.

→

It is obvious that there is no any experiment to show the existence of the determinately irreversible
or reversible process of time reversals in the interactions of micro-particles up to now. First, in the
nature processes, a particle’s velocity can not reverse automatically, so the process does not exist
in nature. Next, we now can not accurately reverse a particle’s velocity by artiﬁcial method. No
laboratory in the world now can do it. Therefore, both the determinately reversible and determinately

1

irreversible processes of time reversals are actually unveriﬁed at least on the resent experimental level.
What we have done now is the statistical processes of time reversals shown as follows.

2.The statistical processes of time reversal

→

For the statistical process of time reversal of A + B

C + D, we do not reverse the velocities of
particles C and D directly then make them collide along the completely same orbits as in the positive
process. Substitute for it, we take other C and D particles obtained from another method and make
them collide each other along the diﬀerent paths. After collisions, A and B particles may be produced
or may not. For the process in which A and B particles are produced, if the transition amplitudes
of A + B
A + B are the same, we call them the statistically reversible (or
symmetry) processes of time reversal. Otherwise, we called them the statistically irreversible processes.
The concept of statistically reversible or irreversible processes of time reversal is only meaningful for
the system composed of a large number of particles.
It is meaningless for the process of a single
particle.

C + D and C + D

It is obvious that all have been done in the current experiments are the statistically processes of
time reversal, so we only discuss them below. But the theoretical discussions are beneath determinative
and statistical processes, for in the theoretical discussion of time reversal, the directions of particle’s
moments and spins are always accurately reversed, but the transition amplitudes are always calculated
in the statistical forms. Some time we call the statistical process of time reversal as the time reversal
process directly for simpliﬁcation below.

The time reversal of a single particle’s decay and the double particle’s collision are discussed

individually below. For a single particle’s decay, we have following situations:

(1).The statistically irreversible processes of time reversals
Suppose the transition amplitude of A particle decaying into B and C particle is SA→BC, and the
transition amplitude of the reversal process to produce A particle by the collision of B and C particles
If SA→BC = SBC→A, we call the process as the statistically reversible (or symmetry)
is SBC→A.
process of time reversal. If SA→BC
= SBC→A, we call the process as the statistically irreversible (or
non-symmetry) process of time reversal. Suppose the transition probabilities of positive and reversal
processes in the unit time are dWA→BC and dWBC→A individually, according to the deﬁnition, we
have

that in the double particle’s collision only one particle is produced in its ﬁnal state up to now (in
spite of the collisions producing a boson in its middle state.). Even though the process two particles
colliding and forming a single particle may be possible, the possibility would be very little so that it
can almost be regarded as zero.

We can take the process of π0 meson decaying into double photons π0

been obtained that ψ0 meson can be formed by the collision of two free photons (The details will

be discussed later.). So the process π0
2γ violates the symmetry of time reversal obviously. The
similar situation is the process η
2γ. Though we have not done the time reversal experiment of
a single particle’s decays described above now, we can conclude by means of the theoretical analyses
that the processes of a single particle decaying into two or more particles are irreversible for time
reversal. Otherwise we would have to face serious contradiction in theory.

We can discuss this conclusion more directly from another angle. Suppose we have an isolated
system composed of unstable particles at beginning, for example, a large number of free neutrons.
After long enough time, most of neutrons in the system would decay into protons, electrons and
neutrinos. Then, let those protons, electrons and neutrinos collide to each other. (Because we only
discuss the statistical process of time reversal, not the determinate process, it is unnecessary for us to
reverse particle’s velocity directly.). It is obvious that the system is completely impossible to return
to its original pure neutron state.

(2). The statistically and completely irreversible processes of time reversals
The statistically and completely irreversible processes of time reversals is deﬁned meaningful for
both a single particle and a system composed of a large number of particles. In the reversal processes,
we do not directly reverse the velocities of B and C particles coming from A particle’s decay and let
them collide. Instead, we use B and C particles coming from other resources and collide them each
other. After that, we ﬁnd that A particle is never produced. The obvious examples of statistically
and completely irreversible processes of time reversals are the processes of strange particle’s decays.
For example

All of these processes above can be achieved through natural or artiﬁcial forms. But no any opposite
process shown below has been ﬁnd in nature or in laboratories in the world up to now

These processes are regarded to violate the law of strange number conservation and impossible to
exist. The strange particles always produce associatively through strong interaction but decay alone
through weak interaction. For example, the producing processes of Λ and K 0 particles

of strange number conservation forbids the existence of reversal processes of strange particle’s decays.
The similar situations are the processes of charmed particle’s decays, but it needs not to discuss any
more here.

(2).The other situations.
There are two kinds of experiments used to study the time reversal problems of single particle’s
processes at present. One is to measure neutron’s electrical dipole moment. If electromagnetic in-
teraction is symmetry for time reversal, the neutron’s electrical dipole moment should be zero. The

current experiments show that the measurement value is µ < 1.0
show that the existing process of stable neutron’s existence seems time reversal symmetry. It can not
show that the decay process of an unstable particle is also time reversal symmetry.

×

Another experiments for the time reversal of a single particle’s processes are to measurement
the phase angles of decay particles. Because the calculations of phase angles invoice the theory of
interaction, it is diﬃcult for us to know what is the theoretical eﬀect and what is the experimental
eﬀect. These two kinds of experiments are indirect. From them we can not decide whether or not
time reversal is symmetry for micro-particle’s decays. Therefore, we can get conclusion from discussion
above that for the decay processes of micro-particles, the reversibility of determinative time reversal
is only an unveriﬁed suppose, and the reversibility of statistical time reversal is actually impossible.
The collision processes of double particles are discussed as follows. They can also be divided into

several classes below.

(1).The statistically reversible processes of time reversal.
Suppose the transition amplitude of producing B and C particles by the collision of A and B
particles is SAB→CD, the transition amplitude that A and B particles are produced by the collision of
B and C particles is SCD→AB. If the invariable amplitudes are the same, i.e., MAB→CD = MCD→AB,
we say that the process has reached the detail balance and call the process as the statistically reversible
(or symmetrical) process of time reversal. Otherwise, the process is considered as the statistically
irreversible (or non-symmetry) process of time reversal. At present it is generally thought that the
collision processes of double micro-particles are reversible or symmetrical for time reversals. But only
a few experiments support this conclusion actually shown as follows

a). The processes of strong interaction with (2)

and

The experiments support the symmetry of time reversal with about 0.5 per cent precision.

b). The process of electromagnetic interaction with (4)

Only 20 per cent precision supports the symmetry of time reversal. The precision seems too low.
c). The experiments used to measurement π meson’s spin (3)

↔
Because there exist so many collisions of double particles, only based on such a few experiments,
it is not enough for us to aﬃrm that all collision processes of double particles are reversible for time
reversal.

(2)The statistically irreversible processes of time reversa
It can be pointed out that there exists a kind of processes of double particle’s s that obviously
violate the symmetry of time reversal. They are the processes in which particle pairs collide, annihilate
and produce new particles with only one resonant particle appearing in the middle state. For example

ψ+ + ψ− in detail. Because the process involves

strong interaction with π mesons in the ﬁnal state, the accurate form of transition amplitude Se→π
can not be obtained, so that the section of the process can not be calculated. However, because the
initial and ﬁnal states are deﬁnite, we can always write the cross-section of collision in the center

opposite processes is

That is to say, the diﬀerential cross-section of reversal process is 4.14 times more than that of positive
process. Besides, there is another relation

is to say, the cross-section of photon pair collides and transforms into electron pair is 1.67 times more
than that of electron pair annihilating into two photons. This conclusion is unimaginable. It is easy
for the electron pair of low energy annihilating into photons. But up to now it has no any report to
show that two free photons can collide and transform into electron pair with bigger possibility than
that in the process of electron pair annihilating into photons. What has been observed in the current

then electron pair is produced, not two free photons collide. In fact, even though two free photons can
collide and transform into electron pair, its probability should be very low, otherwise our university
would not like what we now see mainly to compose of positive particles.

We can discuss this problem further. The scatter of two photons is a four-order process. Let ω
represent photon’s energy, m represent electron’s mass, r0 represent electron’s classical radium, by
the calculation of re-normalization (6), we know that its cross-section directs ratio to ω6 in the low

Here α = e2/4π = 1/137. Suppose ω/m = 0.01we get σL = 10−18πr2

of two low energy photons is very small, almost can be seen as zero. On the other hand, in the
high-energy process with ω >> m , the scattering cross-section directs ratio to ω−2 with

Here b is a constant without dimension. The order of magnitude of constant b is estimated as follows.
It can be known from Eq.(30) that the scattering cross-section increases with the increase of photon’s
energy under the condition of low energy, but decreases with the increase of photon’s energy under
the condition of high energy. So it must exist an energy value on this value the scattering cross section
does not increase or decrease with energy’s change. For simpliﬁcation, taking this energy as the middle
value with ω = m, and let σH = σL, we can get b = 10−6, and have

Under the condition of high energy, suppose ω/m = 100we can get σH = 10−10πr2

cross-section of photon pair’s scatter and annihilation should also be the same. But according to
the estimation above, if the process of electron pair annihilating into photons is reversible, according
to Eq.(29), the orders of magnitudes of the cross-section of two high energy photons (ω/m = 100)

annihilating into electron pair is about σ

From the cases shown above, it is reasonable for us to consider that in the other processes of
particle’s reactions, no matter what kind of interaction, strong or weak or electromagnetic interactions,
the symmetry of time reversal would be widely violated more or less. The situation seems like the law
of parity conservation several decades ago, the symmetry hypothesis of time reversal in the processes of
particle physics is an unveriﬁed one, and in fact, it may be completely wrong. So we should re-examine
this hypothesis by the further theoretical and experimental researches.

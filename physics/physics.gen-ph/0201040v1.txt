We return to the subject of stability of inﬁnite time asymptotics of kinetic equations. We found

a model which is simpler than those studied previously and which shows unstable behavior corre-

sponding to our arguments from [1], where, however, a relatively complicated problem was treated.

Our simpliﬁcation to four levels interacting with surroundings enable us to proceed easily through

all the way with just a pen and paper. We provide no numerical modelling whose justiﬁcation

causes naturally diﬃculties to the reader. We draw also further consequences of the found instabil-

ity, not only with respect to higher order terms in kinetic equations but also concerning the very

philosophy of physical modelling. The latter point can give more practically oriented physicist even

better motivation than mere speculations about potential instabilities due to higher order terms

in perturbation treatments without concrete resolution of correct asymptotics.

INTRODUCTION

Subject of our paper are new results questioning stability of solution of kinetic equations.

Kinetic equations are widely used in solid state or statistical physics in modelling of transfer

processes including relaxation phenomena, inﬂuence of external ﬁelds etc. This concerns

a great number of physical theories appropriate for diﬀerent physical regimes of interest

like Boltzmann equation [2], Fokker-Planck equation [3], Pauli master equation [4], or its

generalized version introduced independently in diﬀerent forms by Zwanzig, Mori [5, 6]

etc. General mathematical structure of these theories is the set of diﬀerential or integro-

diﬀerential equations (of the ﬁrst order), which determine time evolution of quantities of

interest. Speciﬁc type of these diﬀerential equations is not unique, in its easiest form we

meet with time independent Markov process (without memory), the other may contain time

dependencies in coeﬃcients (for example dependence on external ﬁelds), memory terms

(time nonlocal equations), or inhomogenous terms or nonlinearity. Instabilities or chaotic

behavior in case of complicated nonlinear equations are surely not very surprising. Below

we will deal with the easiest form of such equations - the set of linear diﬀerential equations

with constant coeﬃcients. Speciﬁc topic of this work is scrutiny of stability of steady state,

including that of the attractor nature of the steady state. Let us give some comments here,

how this treatment is related to the other types of mathematical structure which are also

used in physically similar treatments, and about physical consequences of this work. Time-

local and memory-including theory of Markov processes are related in general (for general

mathematical theory- see for example [7]) and also explicit equivalence for speciﬁc type of

equations stemming from the Liouville equation could be found [8]. The goal of this work

is to argue that memory for Markov processes can be integrated into time local coeﬃcients.

In addition we are interested in steady state and inﬁnite time asymptotics. Coeﬃcients (in

evolution matrix) often turn into time independent ones in inﬁnite time region [9, 10]. Some

kind of Markov approximation here becomes exact. This provides the connection with our

work. Inﬂuence of external ﬁelds is further property which can be often related with topic

of our interest.

The origin of kinetic equations is mostly in perturbational theories, which turn funda-

mental microscopical physical laws into diﬀerential equations determining time evolution of

macroscopic quantities available in experiments. For practical purposes the coeﬃcients are

2

usually approximated by calculation of leading terms of the Taylor series in a perturbational

parameter. Quite usual is using approximation of the second order in coupling to uncon-

trolled degrees of freedom, what enables to incorporate connected relaxation phenomena.

Then the time evolution of ”quantities of physical interest” is solved. Formally, validity

of all these approximations of the perturbational origin is limited on the time axis. On

the other hand, these are the steady state and asymptotic limit which are of the greatest

physical importance. Otherwise well applicable theory is thus asked to achieve reasonable

results also for this time region. Expected results like the Boltzmann distribution were found

in the simplest kinetic models, what gave physicists strong belief in general applicability of

the particular kinetic theory. There is a statement that little changes of coeﬃcients can

not change in very dramatic way results of numerical studies, which is usually considered

as ”physically reasonable” . However, we want to argue that this statement is NOT true.

Maybe some people (mainly mathematically oriented) can justify such a statement in general,

but they mostly think, that it is the matter of purely mathematical toys that are seldom

present in normal day physics. Our warning is: Nothing is so far from the truth.

Recently we found in [1] rather unexpected instability in asymptotical behavior in case

of a not very complicated open system. The latter showed some not very standard features,

but no direct indication of internal collapse in modelling of time development, of the type

of, e.g., a clearly unphysical result. Many model approximations, where one can meet the

below described instability, may seem to be quite usual or not very suspicious.

However, whatever is the truth about correct time asymptotics of the model hamiltonian

from [1], we would like to warn the reader against unexpected features encountered in

this problem. When one incorporates (according to his/her opinion) important physical

processes into kinetic equations, attention must be also focused on stability of the solution

of the problem. In particular the question is which part of the results is correct and which is

only a belief (and contingently only an unjustiﬁed belief). In case when the resulted steady

state can not be confronted with, e.g., thermodynamical laws, the result of thus invalid

simulation may seem to be quite good.

Sometimes physical belief in the second order approximation results is hidden into so-

phisticated mathematical methods which pretend to give a ”general” proof of correctness

of the second order results without realistic treatment of the stability, case by case. Such

methods might, regardless of their mathematical validity and usefulness, in concrete appli-

3

cations leave a space for speculations about existence of instabilities, in some important

features of the solution, like in our model from [1]. In [1] we showed how it is possible to

fulﬁl so called Davies theorems [11] and, simultaneously, also obtain sharp instability in the

long time regime behavior against higher order contributions to Tokuyama-Mori coeﬃcients.

The proper quantity of our interest is time asymptotics of the kinetic equation (regardless

of whether the steady state is given only by internal dynamics, or it is inﬂuenced by some

regular external ﬁeld, presence of interchange particle etc.).

Organization of our paper is the following: In part 2 we introduce a quite usual transfer

process model - four site open quantum system interacting with surroundings. We perform

standard treatment using second order perturbational theory of relaxation with full spectral

analysis of evolution matrix and the unique asymptotic steady state will be found. One can

verify that the model, at least in standard thinking, contains description of all the important

physical processes present here. Further we introduce (in section 3) a correction to evolution

matrix. We thus add a transfer channel, whose description is constructed in the same way

like that of the previous ones. However, we assume the eﬀectiveness of the new channel to

be very small with respect to that of the original channels. This new process is also not

apparently seen to change overall properties of system. Nevertheless, dramatic changes in

the steady state will appear. The small perturbation will be treated in two distinct ways.

First we consider it like a higher order correction in the perturbational series to our second

order approximation. This approach is in our view mathematically more interesting, but is

rather speculative because we do not explicitly calculate all the fourth order contribution

that can come from higher order calculation in some exact microscopical theory. However,

the instability of the second order approximation is veriﬁed regardless this objection. The

second possibility is to complement the model by a further small parameter which will be

limited to zero after the asymptotic calculation. In this case we fully stay at a position of the

standard second order kinetic theory, but we consider model character of our hamiltonian

as in the everyday physics, and we treat stability of the model conclusions against ”omitted

physically irrelevant” process. In part 4 we throw some light on indication of instability of

the given type. At ﬁrst we show its indication in spectrum of the evolution matrix, then

a purely analytical treatment of stability will be given. In part 5 we compare our result

with van Hove limit of the same model Hamiltonian. We will ﬁnd a connection with some

pathological case of this well understood limit, where kinetic theory also may have problems

4

with establishing of asymptotical state.

All these ideas are presented on this simple model. Further consequences about relation to

Davies theorems are not repeated , interested reader can ﬁnd them in [1]. All the calculations

are hand made product and the reader is pretty invited to follow them. The reader is

also invited to think how the referred problems, which one may consider as clear or quite

trivial, may become forgotten when a complicated model is treated which is not analytically

calculable, but where only computer simulations are at hand.

Let us consider the following model hamiltonian of a four site open system. We measure

}

(1)

This hamiltonian describes our four site system where creation c†

i and annihilation operators

ci are each related to the i-th site, with three transfer channels, two of them being bath-

induced the remaining one being coherent. As far as we consider one particle only, there is

no necessity to introduce (anti)commutational relations between these operators. Dynamics

of the system is dominated by bath induced transfer channels between 1-2 and 3-4 sites and
a coherent transfer channel 2-3. B†
phonon mode ( fulﬁlling boson commutational relation), G(i−j)

k, Bk are creation and annihilation operators of k-th bath

are coupling constants of the

k

system-bath interaction. Parameter J describes power of the coherent channel.

We do not allow the interference between bath induced channels 1-2 and 3-4, what means

to fulﬁl conditions like:

Ωk)G(1−2)∗

G(3−4)

T rBath(ρBathB†

kBk) = 0.

δ(ǫ

Xk

This can be generally fulﬁlled if one considers that the particular transfer channels are

induced by diﬀerent phonon modes

One can treat this hamiltonian using various schemes. Firstly, it is possible to think

about diﬀerent regimes, according to diﬀerent magnitude of the coeﬃcients in Hamiltonian.

G(1−2)

k

= 0.

We are here interested in the regime where it is appropriate to treat J- and bath-induced

transfer channel as a perturbation. We emphasize that this choice does not correspond to

so-called van Hove limit [12]. One can diversify the physical interpretation of hamiltonian

(1) and a chosen perturbation scheme. Coherent channel one can consider as a slow internal

motion treated according to [13], but it may also represent constant or periodical external

ﬁeld inﬂuence.

Various constructions of kinetic equations can be also applied. We restrict ourselves to

those which respect chosen mathematical structure and the physical regime. Though also

here physicist use various formalisms, one may obtain our results using Nakajima-Zwanzig

identity, Tokuyama-Mori equation (both in their second order approximation), and also

Haken-Strobl-Reineker parameterization [14, 15]; all these ways lead to formally the same

master equation:

The equality of coeﬃcients for 1-2 and 3-4 transfer is our additional assumption, that can

not be deduced from (1). Notice that J, Γ↑, Γ↓ we consider as perturbations of the same

magnitude, proportional to the parameter λ2.

(Reason the proportionality is only a consistency with standard perturbational order of

bath-induced transfer channel.)

The steady state is given by the condition:

We are now to calculate the complete spectrum of the evolution matrix. Firstly: this

enables us to show that steady state is also the unique asymptotic state of this equation.

Furthermore we will argue that the solution has no apparent deviant feature. Last but not

least, in section 4 we will show that in a careful treatment one can indicate, in this spectrum,

the instability calculated below.

calculate a characteristic equation. After bit of algebra (we must calculate determinant of

Twelve roots can be calculated directly from the quadratic terms. What remains is an equa-

tion of the fourth order. The roots can be in principe also extracted using Cardano formula,

but it does not provide an easy survey. Instead we inspect behavior in the λ

0 limit of

→

the perturbational parameter. This analysis and calculation of twelve exact eigenvectors is

provided in Appendix.

In conclusion: there is only one steady state and, at least for not very high parameter

λ, all the other eigenvectors of matrix 3 have negative real parts, i.e. connected terms

in time evolution simulation disappear in the inﬁnite time and the steady state is also

the asymptotical one. Because of ﬁnite order of the matrix there is a region surrounding

the zero, where this problem has inﬁnite time asymptotics given by (10), so one can limit

himself/herself to this region without complications. For very high values of λ parameter,

the model need not have the correct behavior in accordance with general inapplicability of

the perturbational treatment for this case. The worth notice is that the zero eigenvalue

came purely from the ﬁrst submatrix A. The others have nonzero determinants and thus

the only solution of the steady state condition must be zero for associated elements in the

density matrix.

normalization condition

We can give at this place the solution to steady state condition (10). We work with

We speciﬁcally note the equality in population at sites 2 and 3. The reader may speculate

whether this model and result are in whatever sense bad. In any case, there is no internal

collapse in these calculations. One may be suspicious about the fact that the model does

not lead to thermodynamical equilibrium, but as we notice above we do not argue that this

system is in thermodynamical equilibrium as we are not in the van Hove limit, and also

the purely internal character of the coherent transfer was not speciﬁed. There are some

physicists who believe that the validity of thermodynamical laws must be in some direction

connected with the van Hove limit [16]. The 2-3 channel is elastic what implies 2-3 symmetry

and consequent equality ρ22 = ρ33. The transfer term proportional to J can come also from

deﬁned (e.g. harmonic) external ﬁeld; then thermodynamical prediction can fail or this

prediction need not be clear without further calculations.

III. PERTURBATION

In this section we introduce a small perturbation of model (1) in form of an incoherent

transfer channel between sites 2 and 3. The new terms in evolution matrix can be quite

small with respect to the other ones coming from the previous consideration. Construction

of the terms is fully analogical to the previous one. Formally one can include a change into

hamiltonian :

The term ”small perturbation” has to be formalized in order to talk about the instability.

We have worked out this point in two diﬀerent ways. First of them is submitted mainly for

a mathematically oriented reader. We consider g↑, g↓ as proportional to λ4.

(17)

(18)

J, Γ↓, Γ↑ ∝

λ2

g↑, g↓ ∝

λ4

One may have some physical objections against this interpretation, stemming from the fact,

that we did not provide complete 4-th order inspection of the kinetic theory. But we have

quite narrow ambition here. We point out the instability of the result (13) against the 4-th

order correction, which we consider to be arbitrary - as a potentiality. We argue that an

arbitrary perturbation could be used to achieve this conclusion. The physical motivation

in this interpretation is in the background only, in order to get the reader interested, the

statement is of mathematical character. One can also omit here the additional term in

Hamiltonian δH , and think of the perturbation as of a higher order terms coming potentially

from the Hamiltonian (1) that are omitted in standard second order calculation. We will

compare the results (13) and (16) in λ

0 limit where the perturbational treatment is best

→

veriﬁed. (Performing this limit has of course no consequence in connection with the main

statement - instability.)

The second interpretation stays fully on the position of the second order kinetic equation.

We introduce some further parameter η that measures relative power of diﬀerent transfer

J, Γ↓, Γ↑ ∝

λ2

g↑, g↓ ∝

ηλ2.

(19)

After evaluation of the λ

0 limit, which gives precise mathematical sense to our calcula-

→

tion, we consider η to be small, formally limiting to 0. We shall show that regardless the

arbitrarily small (but nonzero) magnitude of η, the result (13) is not preserved. In other

channel

words,

lim
η→0

ρ(η)

= ρ(η = 0)

→

ρ designates here the steady state in λ

0 limit. This is the central statement that we

are going to prove. We inspect the stability of standard kinetic equations with respect to

physical processes which were not incorporated into a model in question because of their not

high strength (at least from a formal, cursory point of view) and consequent underestimating

their inﬂuence. This point is possibly not so interesting mathematically because the second

order theory is held here, but it seriously questions the straightforward applicability of

the standard kinetics from the physical point of view. Both these interpretations are from

mathematical and also from physical context quite distinct. We argue that the instable

behavior is the internal problem of the approximation (3) and does not come from the very

specialized choice of perturbation or scheme of its treatment.

In the next subsection we

11

We clearly see that if g↑ 6

= g↓, then sharp changes appear in solution (13). We did

not assume equality between these coeﬃcients. Moreover the physical motivation of our
correction points out to g↑ 6

= g↓. Rather the standard thermodynamics relation

(20)

may be assumed. Derivation of this statement consists in some additional assumptions about

initial state of the bath, which are, however, standard. Of course, if one is interested in the

Taylor series structure in higher order expansion of (17), our interpretations are mutually

diﬀerent, but the general picture is not changed.

We would like to give further warning here. One need not be very surprised because of the

following argumentation. Transfer channel connected with parameter J is in fact physically

also of the fourth order, because its direct application to density matrix (commutator [J, ρ] )

change either the ket or bra side of density matrix only and comparable process connecting

12

the diagonal terms in density matrix is thus of the fourth order. Then this new included

channel is comparably strong (in the ﬁrst interpretation) or even stronger (in the second

argumentation) than the ﬁrst one. We give threefold counterargument:

1, - Nevertheless, formally the coherent process (J-proportional) is included in the second

order. Such a treatment is absolutely standard. Care in this direction becomes diﬃcult

or technically unable for complicated system. Moreover this objection also seriously

questions concept of the generalized master equation in general, because treatment of

the whole density matrix (of the system) included information about set of generally

incompatible observables. With respect to a particular measurement (here for example

site probability measurements) the other terms unrelated to this measurement (here

oﬀ-diagonal matrix element) have always the role of some kind of memory. So their

treatment apparently diﬀers from that of bath induced channel one.

2, - Physical intuition in more complicated case is uncertain and may fail.

3, - If one is internally sure about his/her intuition, please try inspect the formula (17)

again now with the following sheme

or alternatively

Γ↑, Γ↓, J

One can see here that in the same limits as above, the instability is still present, though

the perturbation should be now smaller than the fourth order coherent channel. In

fact the coherent channel transfer is seemingly of the higher order then 4! Have you

seen it before this limit calculation?

IV.

INDICATION OF INSTABILITY

We have argued in the previous section, that instability described above is the matter of

internal problem of approximation (3). Despite of its reasonable behavior in time evolution

simulation which we proved in Appendix, a problematic step has been indicated above and

this problem must be visible purely from the second order approximation calculation. In

13

fact, if one were not able to give some indication of the instability of the approximation

from itself, the situation would have been critical. At ﬁrst: Calculation in higher order

is not standard, and what is worse, it is an extremely diﬃcult task. The second problem

is that in that case one can never ( in no ﬁnite order of calculation) be sure whether the

provided approximation is already stable. We give two points which are connected with our

instability and indicate it.

A. Long-time excitation in the spectrum

This method enables us to show quite simply how to obtain the indication purely from

spectrum of the evolution matrix in the second order approximation. What is important

from practical point of view, one may use this method without principal diﬃculties also in

complicated models by numerical analysis and, further, may in many ways also implement

orientational indication into her/his time evolution computer simulation. Only for simplicity

and without any change in physical context we assume that the number of linearly indepen-

dent eigenvectors equals to the order of the matrix. In problem (3) this statement is proven,

because none of the submatrix has two identical eigenvalue. The general form of spectral

decomposition of ﬁnite (non-normal) matrix is then:

Wij =

ξq(Lq)i(Rq)j

q
X

(Rq)i(L′

q)i = δqq′.

Xi

where ξq is q-th eigenvalue and Rq(Lq) is the associated right(left i.e usual) row (column)

eigenvector. This decomposition holds good this normalization:

Kinetic equations conserve total probability, what results into the fact that eigenvalue 0

is always present. Have a look at our result in the Appendix again. The very suspicious
eigenvalue is ξ4. In perturbation scheme (9), there is a proportionality ξ4 ∝
that this eigenvalue need not be very stable against our perturbation regardless of the type of

λ6. No wonder

scheme. More generally: Let us have, in our spectrum, eigenvalue with real part approaching

zero (with λ

0) and proportional to higher than second power of λ (n > 2):

→

Wij = 0

(L0)i(R0)j + a1λn

(L1)i(R1)j + . . .

·

·

14

We explicitly emphasize that also (Lq), (Rq) are λ-dependent what only enables that Wij

has terms of just the second order.

bility, for example perturbation

Then one can easily construct the mathematical ”perturbation” which causes the insta-

δWij =

·

a1λn

·

(L1)i(R1)j +

(λn)

O

that change the stationary state from (L0) to (L1) in the limit.

In the ﬁrst perturbational technique (18) possibility of such construction is straightfor-

ward. In the second case (19) we must construct it from the more complicated terms, but

one can see in our model (16) that it is possible. Of course, not each one of the math-

ematical ”perturbations” is physically interpretable. One usually has some conditions for

the evolution matrix stemming from the conservation laws (at least particle conservation in

case of solid state physics), etc., but the set of possible perturbations is so great, that it

surely contains also reasonable perturbations. One of them we introduced in subsection 3.

In our problem, there is the ”near-the-zero” eigenvalue proportional to the sixth order in λ,

so we could choose the perturbation smaller than we have done. Concluding this subsection

we notice that the reciprocal real part of eigenvalue (without sign) can be also called the

lifetime of ”excitation” (though it need not be a very appropriate name in some cases) .

This provides practical indication of this instability - highly increasing lifetime of relaxation

phenomena when the parameter of perturbation is reduced according to formal scheme of

construction of given kinetic equation. Because of clarity of this point we do not give any

formal statement.

B. Analytical treatment of stationary condition

In this subsection we give an easy example of analytical stationary condition (10) treat-

ment. This treatment is stable against perturbation. We know that it need not be usually

the very appropriate method from practical point of view. When a direct explicit resolution

is not available (for more complicated or extended problems) one must take extreme care in

computational implementation about numerical errors. The main reason for introducing this

calculation is further understanding of the origin of the instability for the reader who still

has not internally accepted the presented facts. For our treatment we need (for simplicity)

15

to assume that there is a unique asymptotical state of the system. This is because we will

here take care of the stability of the zero eigenvector of the evolution matrix only. This

treatment does not provide the proof that there is no potential eigenvalue with positive real

part (collapse of model) or there is some eigenvalue along the imaginary axes so near to zero

(real part) that it can approach through some perturbation the imaginary axis. We look for

resolution of approximation (3) as Taylor series coeﬃcients.

ρ =

λnρ(n)

n
X
The important diﬀerence as compared to Taylor series of solution (13) is that we explicitly

assume existence of perturbation of the order λ3, respectively ηλ2, which is otherwise arbi-

trary. We take only the results which are independent of potential perturbation. However,

this is a standard correct perturbational method. Such a treatment gives us only ﬁnite

number of conditions for Taylor coeﬃcients. The calculation is straightforward. Condition

in the zeroth order enables the calculation of

ρ(0)
12 = 0;

ρ(0)
14 = 0;

ρ(0)
23 = 0;

ρ(0)
34 = 0,

while in the second order

ρ(0)
13 = 0;

ρ(0)
24 = 0;

ρ(2)
12 = 0;

ρ(2)
14 = 0;

(21)

Here we clearly see the internal problem of the second order approximation (3). Neither

the zeroth order of the density matrix is resolved by stationary condition (10). We have
still a two-dimensional subspace (arbitrary ρ(0)

33 ) where the steady state can be found

22 ; ρ(0)

(in the Liouville space of the density matrix). The result (13) is the corollary of implicit

assumption of zero eﬀect of higher order calculation, not justiﬁable from the mathematical

point of view. One can comprehend that including a potentially higher order perturbation

like (16) will deﬁne the zeroth order density matrix in space of our result (21) with a high

degree of arbitrariness.

The solution, which is correct to at least the zeroth order and would have to be stable

against perturbations, one must calculate more precisely.

We notice that including the perturbation not as a potentiality, but like a real eﬀect

changes the stability of the model. One can prove in both interpretations that we obtain

16

further condition (once, in the order λ4 or respectively ηλ2)

g↑ρ(0)

22 = g↓ρ(0)
33 .

In the ﬁrst interpretation we obtain in the fourth order also further conditions; however,

because of its speculative character we will not publish it here. This means that the situation,

despite of its unpleasant character, is not hopeless. One can indicate instability and also

the ways to improve models are principally possible. Let us notice that the result obtained

in this subsection is in accordance with all previous calculations in λ

0 limit.

→

V. THE VAN HOVE LIMIT

All our previous results were obtained in a way that is not just standard in relaxation

theory. We introduced perturbational scheme (9) for calculation of the second order kinetic

equation for model Hamiltonian (1). We gave some physical arguments for this choice.

Nevertheless, the standard variant of great popularity is of course the van Hove limit [12]:

J

1, Γ↑, Γ↓ ∝

∝

λ2.

We argue here that the problem with inﬁnite time asymptotics of the model (1) (in the

second order kinetic equation) is reﬂected also in this well understood limit. To see this we

introduce ” energetic” representation in eigenvectors of HS

(22)

(24)

We oﬀer some comments regarding Hamiltonian (24) and the van Hove limit (22). There

are two bath induced channels between levels 1,II and III,4 respectively, in analogy with the

17

previous treatment in site representation. What is the diﬀerence is that there is no coherent

transfer term in energetic representation; on the other hand two weak bath induced channels

between levels 1,III and II,4 appeared. The strength of these channels is proportional to

(JG)2, so this term is in the second order kinetic theory of relevance in the van Hove limit

only.

(The region of physical applicability of (22) does not contain the regime speciﬁed

before in connection with (9). We only clarify behavior of treated model hamiltonian from

another view.) These channels cause communication between speciﬁed levels for short time

regime, nevertheless both the channels lie oﬀ the energy shell, so for the long time regime

this transfer is forbidden. Then the second order kinetic theory with integrated memory

like [6] in inﬁnite time forbids all the communication between pair of levels 1+II and that of

levels III+4. Asymptotical stationary condition then has two linearly independent solutions.

Nevertheless

c†
1c1 + c†

IIcII

does not commute with the full Hamiltonian (24), it is no integral of motion. Consequently

one can not use the long time (Born-Markov) approximation upon looking for time asymp-

totics - the result may depend also on short time transient eﬀects. The result obtained in

this way is also seemingly unstable against higher order calculation.

In Appendix B we

give the complete second order kinetic equation and its solution in the van Hove scheme.

The solution (B6) of stationary condition (10) shows just the same asymptotic state of the

density matrix (and potential instability) like (21).

We stay here at quite real physical problem: Consideration whether these levels are

isolated and the transfer is strictly forbidden, what suggests ordinary meaning of the energy

conservation law, or whether a limited value of electron density can be transferred. The

signiﬁcance of the van Hove limit is here also questioned.

Last but not least, we may also think about more symmetrical case of system - bath

coupling of form:

Xk {

G(1−2)
k

(Bk + B†

k)(c†

1c2 + c†

2c1) + G(3−4)

k

(Bk + B†

k)(c†

3c4 + c†

4c3).

The result for (9) remains unchanged. Then in energy representation also 1,III and II,4

channels appear that lie on energy shell for interaction with low energy phonons, if these are

present. Then the asymptotics in the van Hove limit can be obtained as unique. However,

the existence of such phonons (and channels) is a serious change in physical meaning of the

18

entering model.

Inapplicability of the van Hove approach for physical regime J < G2 is

apparent.

VI. PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES AND CONCLUSIONS

Let us ﬁrstly discuss some physical consequences of possible instability in the ﬁrst scheme

(18). We have shown that the result obtained in the second order may be unstable against

some correction arising in a higher order calculation. Let us stay on the position that

evolution generator (Hamiltonian)(1) is exact, and the only question is the correctness of

its study. Of course, in that case, our construction of higher order correction is rather

speculative, but it proved the instability of the result. The full analysis of the spectrum

of the transfer matrix showed that the most ‘slow excitation of the steady state’ calculated

in the second order has its lifetime of the sixth order in λ. This gives that also in the

case where ﬁrst correction to terms W{22}{33}, W{33}{22} is of the order six, it may cause

such an instability. This questions some standard results obtained in everyday simulations.

Unfortunately we have also some intuitive physical arguments that one must really calculate

at least six order processes for achievement reliable result for transfer between 2-3 sites. This

is because the transfer rate really IS a process (at least) of the 6th order in speciﬁed scheme

(9). Incoherent transfer term between sites 2 and 3 lies oﬀ energy-shell, consequently some

collaboration with bath modes for stabilization is necessary. All the Feynman graphs one

can draw must have for such a transfer great number of lines in order to get on energetic

sphere, implying high order of this transfer. The reported delicate situation in the van Hove

limit also supported caution against straightforward use of kinetic theory. Unfortunately,

any higher order contribution calculation is a diﬃcult task, getting dramatically worse from

order to order. This fact will also in future cause the great popularity of the ” naive ”

treatment;

in this direction, our expectation concerning inﬂuence of our work is rather

pessimistic. Greater care about applicability of usual model methods is, on the other hand

and in the light of our results, more than appropriate. Further investigation should be turned

to higher order inspection of master equation connected with Hamiltonian (1) in speciﬁed

physical regime. Especially the question connected with the inﬁnite time asymptotics is a

great challenge, of crucial physical implication, and not satisfactorily resolved yet.

Determination of the twelve eigenvalues does not meet with problems, because these are

the roots of quadratic polynoms. In addition we would like mainly to know signs of real

parts of the eigenvalues, at least in the limit λ

0. Thus we reduce complicated results

into the Taylor series at least to the order which gives the sign. :

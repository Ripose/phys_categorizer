Low Energy Eﬀective Hamiltonian for a Periodic Array of
Cosmological Branes : The Smectic Universe

D. R. Daniels∗

January 21, 2014

Abstract

Department of Physics, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.

We investigate a simple model of a stack of four dimensional cosmological branes in a ﬁve
dimensional ﬂat bulk via the use of a derived low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian for a ‘radion’-like
ﬁeld associated with brane displacements and deformations. We also extend by analogy the
theory of 3D smectic liquid crystals and multi-lamellar amphiphilic membranes, as are typi-
cally found in soft condensed matter systems, to the 5D case of many parallel brane universes.
The underlying rotational invariance of such a system implies the absence of an explicit intra-
brane cosmological constant term in the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian. The strength of a
quadratic inter-brane potential introduced for stabilisation is calculated self-consistently, and
leads naturally to a novel exponential suppression mechanism for the 4D intra-brane cosmolog-
ical constant. We also pursue, again by analogy to the 3D case, the link between this work and
the Abelian Higgs transition, or superconductivity, in 5D. The relevance of the work presented
here in explicating the cosmological constant problem is also highlighted, outlined and discussed.

Introduction

In this work, we consider a simpliﬁed model of a periodic array of cosmological branes, which
depends on how four dimensional branes are embedded in a ﬂat ﬁve dimensional Euclidean bulk.
We derive the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian for a ‘radion-like’ scalar ﬁeld φ which governs the
ﬂuctuations in the inter-brane distance between successive branes around some equilibrium brane
separation distance d. We ﬁnd that to quadratic order in φ gravitational eﬀects described by the
more familiar Einstein-Hilbert term do not contribute to the eﬀective Hamiltonian, but that rather
the eﬀects of the induced curved brane geometry are determined by the extrinsic curvature tensor.
While of course being inspired by them, our simple model is therefore somewhat diﬀerent to other
current brane models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Moreover, although the crude model to be presented below
seems perhaps to be a little ad hoc and possibly overly phenomenological in appearance in some

respects, it is nevertheless physically well-motivated, and is the simplest kind of model which leads
to the interesting and novel suppression mechanism for the intra-brane cosmological constant as
found in this work.

Furthermore, there has been a great deal of cross-fertilisation over the years between what may
be traditionally termed ‘hard’ condensed matter physics and particle physics, as given for example
by the theory of phase transitions, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the Higgs phenomenon
[8, 9]. There has been somewhat less overlap up to now between what is commonly termed ‘soft’
condensed matter physics [9] and high-energy physics.

However, it has recently been proposed that the universe we inhabit is a four dimensional brane
embedded in a higher dimensional space [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. With already a vast literature existing
on this topic, such brane models (initially inspired by string theories [10]) are thought to shed some
light on the cosmological constant problem and dark energy [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Variants
of these brane models call for the typical structure of two or more such branes, one on top of the
other, to be suitably arranged within the higher dimensional space [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].

Furthermore, such an arrangement of membranes has its corresponding lower-dimensional analog
in the 3D ‘smectic’ (from the greek ‘σµǫγµα’ meaning ‘soap’) phases of amphiphilic molecules or
liquid crystals that often occur in soft condensed matter physics (for comprehensive introductions
and reviews, see [9, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]). The basic brane setup is as shown in
Figure 1. Furthermore, the analogy between a soft condensed matter membrane and a cosmological
brane has also recently been pursued (albeit in a rather diﬀerent context from the work presented
here) in [35]. Moreover, one of the main motivations behind the work presented here is to intro-
duce the physics of smectic systems to the wider high-energy community, within the context of
cosmological branes. As with all analogies, that between soft matter membranes and cosmological
branes has its strengths and weaknesses, with perhaps its greatest strength lying in its heuristic
properties.

The work presented here can therefore be simply viewed on one level as the extension of theoretical
work familiar from 3D smectics to 5D branes. Moreover, the general brane picture outlined in this
work qualitatively resembles previous work carried out on cosmological branes, such as in [36, 37],
for example. Furthermore, one of the main hopes of this work is that physics borrowed from 3D
smectics might prove to be a rather fruitful and useful addition to the already vast literature on
cosmological and high-energy 5D branes.

The other main motivation behind this work lies in the observation that for many 3D smectic
systems the membranes are more or less tensionless (i.e. at zero surface tension). The 5D analog
of 3D surface tension is the intra-brane cosmological constant. Therefore, the work presented here
should shed some light on the cosmological constant problem and dark energy [11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
In our view, one of the diﬃculties of the cosmological constant problem is that it is a
16, 17].
low-energy eﬀect - and as such it is hard to see how to change theories of gravity too much in
the infra-red limit without fouling up the previous outstanding successes of General Relativity.
One way out of such a perceived dilemma may lie in consideration of similar approaches as that
undertaken in the work presented below.

Note that, unless otherwise stated, we will work throughout for the theory presented here in Eu-

clidean space, while assuming that one can always simply Wick-rotate back to Lorentzian spacetime
if required at a later date, or whenever necessary.

Fig 1 Sketch of the smectic universe model. Each brane corresponds to a four dimensional universe embed-
ded in a larger, ﬂat, ﬁve dimensional universe. The inter-brane spacing is governed by a ﬂuctuating scalar
ﬁeld φ. The equilibrium (ground-state) conﬁguration consists of ﬂat, equidistant layers. Also shown (as a
solid directed arrow) is the normal vector of a typical brane.

Embedding Geometry of Smectic Branes

In this section we investigate the extrinsic geometry of embedding a stack of curved, four-dimensional
branes in a ﬂat ﬁve-dimensional bulk universe [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]. We embed the
position of the nth brane, rA
n (x), as follows (where the index A runs from 1 . . . 5, the index µ runs
from 1 . . . 4, and the index n runs from

. . . +

) :

n (x) = xµδA

How to parameterise the embedding is somewhat arbitrary. The choice given in Eq (1) corresponds
to choosing the higher dimensional analog of the ‘Monge gauge’, as used often when dealing with

3

two dimensional membranes [26, 27, 30]. It thus follows that the induced metric on brane n becomes
:

while the unit normal vector to the nth brane becomes :

Additionally, the extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures are related via the well known Gauss-Codazzi
relation [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46] :

and R are the ﬁve dimensional and four dimensional Ricci curvature scalars respectively,
where
R
and K = K µ
µ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor. We consider in this work a ﬂat, ﬁve
dimensional, Euclidean bulk, and so

can therefore speak in terms of either the intrinsic intra-brane curvature R or the extrinsic brane
curvature Kµν interchangeably.

In what follows we will ﬁnd it useful to assume that the ground-state multi-brane conﬁguration is
given by almost ﬂat and equidistantly separated membranes, such that Xn = nd + φn(x), where d
is the equilibrium inter-brane separation distance. We can then perform a perturbative expansion
in φn for all quantities of interest. In this way, we ﬁnd that :

Fig 2 On the left we have depicted the smectic universe ground-state as equally spaced, ﬂat branes. In the
middle, and on the right we have depicted deformations of the ground-state smectic universe which maintain
the equal spacing distance d of each brane (along the normal vector N A
n of each brane). However, unlike the
ﬁgure on the far left, the smectic universes shown in the middle and on the far right are non-ﬂat and thus
possess mean curvature Kn. There is a concomitant energy cost associated with such a bending curvature
of the branes.

Rotational Invariance

The layering of the smectic universe spontaneously breaks the translational as well as rotational
symmetry of the underlying bulk spacetime. As such, any variation of the ﬁeld φ that corresponds
to a rigid rotation of the brane layers must leave the Hamiltonian invariant (see Figure 3). Therefore
distortions of the smectic universe that leave the inter-brane layer separation distance unchanged
(and therefore the Hamiltonian) are dominant (For details of the analogous and corresponding
treatment of 3D smectics see [9, 28, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]).

An inﬁnitesimal global rotation of the brane layers would lead to a transformation on φ of :

φ + Ωµxµ

φ

→

such that the layer normal N A according to Eq (3) gets transformed in accordance with :

∂µφ

∂µφ + Ωµ

which means that ∂µφ is simply not rotationally invariant. We can thus see that due to the
underlying rotational invariance there can be no term in the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian
. Furthermore, it is precisely this rotational symmetry argument that
corresponding to
is also the reason why no explicit intra-brane cosmological constant term can appear in the low-
energy eﬀective Hamiltonian. Such an explicit cosmological constant term would necessarily lead to
1+ 1
a contribution in our approximation of : √g
to the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian,
2
and would thus be disallowed due to rotational symmetry grounds.

The smectic universe can thus be seen as a phase transition to a layered 4D brane conﬁguration from
a bulk 5D space, with an associated symmetry breaking of rotational and translational symmetry.

Fig 3 The top left diagram depicts the ground-state smectic universe with equilibrium inter-brane spacing.
The top right diagram shows a simply translated smectic universe, with the same energy as the ground-state.
The bottom left diagram depicts a simply rotated smectic, with the same energy as the ground-state. The
bottom right diagram shows a smectic universe with compressed inter-brane spacing, and therefore an energy
greater than the ground-state conﬁguration. (The dashed lines represent the reference brane ground-state
of equally spaced, ﬂat layers.)

Heuristic Derivation of the Low-Energy Eﬀective Hamiltonian

We now outline a much simpliﬁed derivation of the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian for a periodic
array of branes, for heuristic purposes, and in order to motivate the following sections.

We parameterise our theory in the full ﬁve dimensional bulk via the ‘radion-like’ ﬁeld φ which
describes the deviation of branes from their ideal, equally spaced and ﬂat conﬁgurations. Given the
underlying translational invariance of our theory, there can be no mass term (proportional to φ2) in
our Hamiltonian. Next to consider are terms with two derivatives :
, roughly perpendicular
∂5φ
(cid:1)
to the branes along the x5 direction, and
along the branes. Due to rotational invariance, we
have seen above that there can be no term in the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian proportional to
. Therefore in order to describe the eﬀects of φ along the branes we need to go to next order
∂µφ
(cid:0)
(cid:1)
. Such a term, as we have also seen from above, arises due to membrane
in derivatives :
extrinsic curvature. So, to lowest order in φ and its derivatives, the only terms which contribute to
the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian are those given by :

Analogous ‘Spin-Wave’ Hamiltonian

For further heuristic purposes, we can consider the following ﬁve dimensional Hamiltonian inspired
by the lower dimensional physics of layering phenomena in ‘spin-waves’ [49, 50] at some density ρ :

(cid:17)

where we can think of q0 = 2π/d as representing the inter-brane spacing. The Hamiltonian must be
translationally invariant, and so no mass term proportional to ρ2 can appear in Eq (10). Since the
2 is negative, the underlying rotational symmetry is broken (as outlined in [53]),
coeﬃcient of
∂Aρ
|
|
accompanied by the formation of smectic-type layers. In this broken phase, we can write for the
, which represents a slow, layered modulation of ρ along
‘spin-wave’ ﬁeld, ρ = ρ0 exp
the x5 direction. Substituting this ansatz into Eq (10), we get as the ground-state conﬁguration,
to lowest order in φ and its derivatives :

One may be somewhat surprised by the anisotropy present in Eq (11). However, the formation of
smectic layers spontaneously breaks the rotational (and translational) symmetry of the system. As
such, any variation of the ﬁeld φ that corresponds to a rigid rotation of the brane layers must leave
the Hamiltonian (Eq (11)) invariant (see also Figure 3).

Smectic Branes Hamiltonian

From the considerations and results of above, we can now therefore, in complete analogy with the
lower-dimensional 3D liquid crystal case, write the total 5D smectic Hamiltonian summed over all
branes as :

(cid:17)

(12)

κ and B are constants introduced in order to measure the relative strength of the contribution to the
Hamiltonian from the intra-layer bending and the inter-layer compressional interaction respectively.

In Eq (12) the energy cost associated with brane layer bending means that the mean extrinsic
curvature, Kn, is penalised, and the branes prefer to remain as ﬂat as possible. The reason for the
use of such a term (proportional to K 2
n) in the above Hamiltonian, as opposed to say that of a more
familiar Einstein-Hilbert term will be outlined below. Furthermore, such a term (proportional to
K 2) also analogously arises in some string theory model Hamiltonians [54, 55, 56].

The quadratic inter-brane potential in Eq (12) represents the simplest and most convenient poten-
tial one could write down (with no loss of generality), for branes around some equilibrium brane
separation d, and characterised by the quadratic strength B. Furthermore, we will calculate the
potential strength B self-consistently later, using a theoretical approach [57, 58] that has found
great success in soft condensed matter systems.

We can see that no explicit (or isolated) cosmological constant terms appear in Eq (12), but only as
in the combination shown, including ∆n. As we have seen, this is ultimately due to the underlying
rotational invariance of a smectic arrangement of branes (for details of the analogous case in 3D
see [9, 28, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]).

Additionally, by performing a small ∆n expansion in Eq (12), we can easily read-oﬀ the relevant
Bd,
cosmological constants, such that we must identify (term by term) :
where Λ4 and Λ5 are the intra-brane and inter-brane cosmological constants respectively. We shall
have further recourse to these results below.

We now proceed from Eq (12) by assuming that the ground-state multi-brane conﬁguration is given
by almost ﬂat and equidistantly separated membranes, such that Xn = nd + φn(x). Expanding
perturbatively in φn(x), and using the results of Eq (7), we can simplify the Hamiltonian (12)

(13)

Moreover, under this approximation, we can show that any contribution from a more familiar
Einstein-Hilbert term (proportional to R) in Eq (13) vanishes. Using the Gauss-Codazzi relation
of Eq (5), (with
= 0), we can always rewrite R in terms of Kµν . Furthermore, using the results
of Eq (7), we can see that to lowest order in φn, it must follow that any contribution that goes like
d4xR in the eﬀective Hamiltonian must vanish (up to surface terms). This explains the absence
R
of any canonical Einstein-Hilbert term in our original Hamiltonian, Eq (12) - such a term simply
does not contribute to

Proceeding further, as long as we probe distance scales along the 5 direction greater than d, we can
safely pass to the continuum limit and write our Hamiltonian, with x5 = n d, as :

which corresponds to the higher-dimensional 5D analog of the 3D smectic phase familiar from
amphiphilic membranes and liquid crystals of soft condensed matter physics [9, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34].

Thus Eq (14) represents the low-energy, eﬀective Hamiltonian of the ‘radion’-like ﬁeld φ character-
ising a stack of branes arranged in a 5D bulk universe. The inter-brane interaction is quadratic
and attractive, whose strength is governed by a single parameter B and leads to an equilibrium
separation distance d between consecutive branes in the stack.

Note again the anisotropy present in Eq (14). The layering of the smectic universe spontaneously
breaks the translational as well as rotational symmetry of the underlying bulk spacetime. Therefore,
any variation of the ﬁeld φ that corresponds to a rigid rotation of the brane layers must leave the
Hamiltonian invariant (as shown in Figure 3).

Self-Consistent Calculation of Potential Strength (B)

The quadratic inter-brane potential in Eq (12) represents the simplest potential one could write
down (with no loss of generality), expanded around some equilibrium brane separation d, and
characterised by the quadratic strength B. We now proceed to calculate B, via the ﬁve-dimensional
treatment of that analogously given for 3D membranes in [26, 57, 58].

The self-consistent condition that must be met by the strength of the inter-brane potential, as

9

(15)

(16)

(17)

governed by B, is given such that typically (and approximately) on average :

<

(cid:1)

> = d2

where the averaging < . . . > is to be carried out using Eq (14). This translates in the continuum
limit (provided we use a cut-oﬀ of π/d for momenta along x5) into the condition : <
> = 1.
This condition is required in order for the quadratic expansion in ∆n around equally spaced branes
for the inter-brane potential, as used in Eq (12), to be self-consistent. Moreover, if the condition
of Eq (15) were not met then the branes would become strongly-interpenetrating, the notion of
individual, equally spaced, and well-separated membranes would break down, and the consistency
of our calculational scheme would become violated.

Therefore, using Eq (14) to ﬁnd the propagator for φ, the equation we need to solve for B is given
by :

Introducing an additional intra-brane small distance cut-oﬀ ǫ, such that
solving for B, as ǫ

The property of interest to immediately note from Eq (17) is the exponential suppression of B as
96κd2
1. This strong suppression eﬀect is unique and peculiar to the smectic brane arrangement
considered in this work.
It is ultimately due to the presence of four derivatives in the original
Hamiltonian (14), describing propagation of φ on four-dimensional branes. This eﬀect can also be
d4q/q4 in the
seen heuristically and on dimensional grounds as being due to the appearance of
φ ﬁeld propagator.

Intra-Brane Cosmological Constant (‘Surface Tension’)

Using the results of above, and via inspection of Eq (12), we are naturally led to identify κ = 1
8πG =

, where lp is the Planck length (in units where c = ~ = 1). Additionally, it is also natural to
8πl2

identify the intra-brane small-distance cut-oﬀ with the Planck length, such that ǫ = lp. Using the
result of Eq (17) and via inspection of Eq (12) as outlined previously above, we can read oﬀ the

Note that it then follows that the intra-brane cosmological constant Λ4 becomes exponentially
In order to see just how well this
suppressed as d increases above just a few Planck lengths.
exponential suppression mechanism works, note that experimentally [13, 16, 17] it is observed that
p . 10−123, which implies that from Eq (18) we must have d & 9 lp. Thus, the mechanism of
Λ4l2
symmetry breaking required for the smectic arrangement of consecutive branes as outlined in this
work naturally leads to a vanishingly small eﬀective intra-brane cosmological constant.

Bulk Cosmological Constant (‘Inter-Brane Pressure’)

Similarly and again, using the result of Eq (17) and via inspection of Eq (12) as outlined previously,
we can read oﬀ the value of the bulk cosmological constant, Λ5, as follows :

Λ5 =

Note that the inter-brane cosmological constant Λ5 also becomes exponentially suppressed as d
increases above just a few Planck lengths. Furthermore, from Eq (18) and Eq (19), we can see
as shown previously above that the relation Λ4 =
Λ5 d/2 also holds between the intra-brane and
bulk cosmological constants.

Higgs (‘Superconductivity’) Analog

It has long been known that there exists a powerful analogy between the 3D phase transition
physics associated with smectic liquid crystals and superconductivity [9, 28, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63].
The purpose of this section is to pursue this analogy further for the case of 5D as considered in
this work.

We begin by giving the canonical Hamiltonian [8] for the Abelian Higgs mechanism in a ﬂat, bulk,
ﬁve-dimensional Euclidean space :

with the ‘charge’ given in terms of the inter-brane spacing by q0 = 2π/d, and where the ‘vector

require a gauge-ﬁxing term
HGF . There is typically much freedom in the choice of a gauge-ﬁxing
term one uses. Furthermore, often the best choice of gauge is one that highlights the underlying
physics. Moreover, due to the underlying gauge invariance of the Hamiltonian, the physics remains

When m2 < 0 in Eq (21), spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, accompanied by the formation
of smectic layers. In this broken phase, we can write for the ‘matter’ ﬁeld, ψ = ψ0 exp(iq0φ), which
represents a slow, layered modulation of the scalar ﬁeld ψ along the x5 direction. The minimum
m2/λ and δNA = ∂Aφ. In this way (albeit in a somewhat
of Eq (20) now occurs when
HT OT of Eq (20) becomes identical to that
unconventional gauge) the Abelian Higgs Hamiltonian
of the smectic Hamiltonian as given by Eq (14), and the analogy is complete.

Conclusion

In this work, we have considered a simpliﬁed model of a periodic array of cosmological branes,
which depends on the extrinsic curvature of embedded, four dimensional branes in a ﬂat ﬁve
dimensional bulk. We derived the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian for a scalar ﬁeld φ which governs
the ﬂuctuations in the inter-brane distance between successive branes around some equilibrium
brane separation distance d. To quadratic order in φ gravitational eﬀects described by the more
familiar Einstein-Hilbert term do not contribute to the eﬀective Hamiltonian. While of course being
inspired by them, our crude model is therefore somewhat diﬀerent to other current brane models
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Moreover, despite the model presented in this work appearing perhaps a little
ad hoc and possibly overly phenomenological in some respects, it is nevertheless physically well-
motivated, and is the simplest kind of model which leads to the interesting and novel suppression
mechanism for the intra-brane cosmological constant as outlined above.

We have also extended by analogy the 3D theory of smectic liquid crystals and multi-lamellar
amphiphilic membranes, to the 5D case of many parallel brane universes, in the hope that physics
borrowed from 3D smectics might shed some light on cosmological 5D branes. As with all analogies,
there are strengths and weaknesses in using this approach, with perhaps the greatest strength of
the analogy pursued here between soft matter branes and cosmological branes lying in its heuristic
properties. Additionally, one main motivation behind this work is the observation that many 3D
smectic systems exist at roughly zero surface tension. The 5D analog of 3D surface tension is the
intra-brane cosmological constant : Λ4. Therefore, it is hoped that one of the main beneﬁts of the
approach taken in this work is that it might shed some light on the cosmological constant problem
and associated dark energy.

We have shown that rotational invariance implies the absence of an explicit cosmological constant
term in the Hamiltonian describing the low-energy ﬂuctuations of a brane in a multi-brane arrange-
ment. In this sense one can say that a symmetry principle constrains the cosmological constant
to be vanishingly small. Furthermore, this symmetry principle is additionally likely to be a Ward
identity also in 5D (when issues relating to the correct measure for path integration are taken into
account), as is the case in 3D [47, 60]. It is very rare to theoretically ﬁnd such a constraint on the
cosmological constant due to an underlying symmetry principle. The only other well known case
is that given by supersymmetry of course, which we do not discuss in this work.

We have also shown in this work a novel possible relaxation mechanism for producing a vanish-
ingly small intra-brane cosmological constant. Namely, if the distance between branes is at its
equilibrium value, then the induced cosmological constant on the brane must vanish. If the inter-
brane separation deviates from its equilibrium value, then the intra-brane cosmological constant
must adjust itself accordingly. Put diﬀerently, any contribution to the intra-brane cosmological
constant (from any source on the brane) can easily be absorbed by a concomitant relaxation of the
inter-brane separation distance.

Taken in total, the work presented here goes some way to explicating the cosmological constant
problem. In this picture, the big bang corresponds to a collision between two branes, as found in
models such as the ekpyrotic [36] or cyclic [37] universes for example. Thus the work presented here
can be thought of as representing the low-energy, eﬀective physics of the corresponding ‘radion-like’
ﬁeld describing a stack of branes in a 5D bulk universe. The great beneﬁt of the work presented here
is that it requires no ﬁne-tuning in order to produce a vanishingly small cosmological constant. A
small cosmological constant arises perfectly naturally, and self-consistently in the approach outlined
above.

Note that the eﬀects described in this work disappear for an isolated, solitary non-interacting
brane, and only arise within the context of a stack of many interacting branes. In this sense, the
eﬀective properties of any single, individual brane has its origin in a ‘many- body’ eﬀect, due to
the many-brane interactions.

Perhaps the best and simplest way to understand the work presented here is in terms of an expansion
in φ and its derivatives in the low-energy eﬀective Hamiltonian as follows. Due to the vanishing
of terms like φ2 and
in the eﬀective Hamiltonian, the next order terms in Eq (14) behave
2
which involve four derivatives on φ. Given that the eﬀects of φ then propagate on
like
d4q/q4) logarithmic behaviour of the φ ﬁeld
a 4D brane, one is guaranteed (to leading order

propagator on the brane. It is precisely this feature of the model presented here (peculiar to a theory
with four derivatives propagating along four dimensions) that ultimately leads in turn to the novel
exponential suppression of the intra-brane cosmological constant for inter-brane separations greater
than a few Planck lengths : d & 9 lp.

It is interesting to note that the results, such as Eq (18) for Λ4, obtained in this work are highly
non-analytic in the gravitational coupling constant G. This aspect of the work presented here
(along with the superconductivity analogy outlined above) is strongly reminiscent of other and
very important cases of non-analyticity in a coupling constant that can be found at the heart of
phenomena such as the formation of Cooper pairs and the allied superconducting instability in BCS
theory [64], as well as the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom in non-Abelian gauge theories [65].
In this sense, the work presented here shares some of the same interesting low-energy features as
other well-known theories with non-trivial infra-red behaviour.

Finally, higher (anisotropic) derivatives in a Hamiltonian can sometimes spell trouble for a theory
with issues of unitarity. However, this is not the case in this work, since we start by describing the
physics in a perfectly isotropic bulk. It is only when we constrain the physics of our observable
universe to a single, isolated brane that the isotropy gets spontaneously broken. There can therefore
be no problems with unitarity for the underlying theory in the bulk. The case considered here is
thus inherently diﬀerent from the more familiar scenarios encountered in quantum ﬁeld theories,
and so the usual unitarity objections sometimes raised, simply do not apply to the work presented
here.

Abstract

Newton’s Second Law deﬁnes inertial mass as the ratio of the applied force on an
object to the responding acceleration of the object (viz., F = ma). Objects that exhibit ﬁnite
accelerations under ﬁnite forces are described as being “massive” and this mass has usually been
considered to be an innate property of the particles composing the object. However mass itself
is never directly measured. It is inertia, the reaction of the object to impressed forces, that is
measured. We show that the eﬀects of inertia are equally well explained as a consequence of
the vacuum ﬁelds acting on massless particles travelling in geodesic motion. In this approach,
the vacuum ﬁelds in the particle’s history deﬁne the curvature of the particle’s spacetime. The
metric describing this curvature implies a transformation to Minkowski spacetime, which we
call the Connective transformation. Application of the Connective transformation produces the
usual eﬀects of inertia when observed in Minkowski spacetime, including hyperbolic motion in
a static electric ﬁeld (above the vacuum) and uniform motion following an impulse. In the case
of the electromagnetic vacuum ﬁelds, the motion of the massless charge is a helical motion that
can be equated to the particle spin of quantum theory. This spin has the properties expected
from quantum theory, being undetermined until “measured” by applying a ﬁeld, and then being
found in either a spin up or spin down state. Furthermore, the zitterbewegung of the charge is
at the speed of light, again in agreement with quantum theory. Connectivity has the potential
for pair creation as the Connective transformation can transform positive time intervals in the
particle spacetime to negative time intervals in Minkowski spacetime.

1 Introduction

Renewed interest in explaining the origin of inertia has been triggered by the foundational work
of Rueda, Haisch, and Puthoﬀ [1,2]. Rather than accepting that inertial mass is simply an innate
property of matter as deﬁned in Newton’s Second Law, these authors show that the eﬀects of
inertia can be explained as a consequence of accelerated motion in the electromagnetic vacuum
ﬁeld, the so-called Zero-Point Field (ZPF). We develop a formal approach to the explanation
of inertia as a reaction to the vacuum ﬁelds that simultaneously addresses aspects of quantum
theory that heretofore have been problematic from a Classical particle point of view. Speciﬁcally
we address the quantum-theoretic prediction that the zitterbewegung of particles occurs at the
speed of light, that particles exhibit spin, and that pair creation can occur.

1

In his study of the coordinate operator in the Dirac equation, Schr¨odinger discovered
microscopic oscillatory motion at the speed of light, which he called zitterbewegung [3]. While
Dirac argued that such motion does not violate relativity or quantum theory [4], from a Classical
particle point of view, these speed of light motions would seem to imply masslessness of the
particle.

Dirac theory also describes particle spin, and Schr¨odinger considered spin to be an
orbital angular momentum that is a consequence of the vacuum ﬁelds [3]. This view of spin was
explored further by Huang [5] and Barut and Zanghi [6].

We present a description of the motion of massless particles that manifests inertia as a
consequence of the vacuum ﬁelds. This approach simultaneously yields spin as an orbital angular
momentum driven by the electromagnetic vacuum (ZPF). We derive an equation of motion for
massless charges as a limit of the Lorentz force equation. This equation can be viewed as a
geodesic equation in a spacetime associated with the particle, and the implied transformation
to Minkowski spacetime (the Connective transformation) yields the eﬀects of inertia as viewed
in Minkowski spacetime. A massless charge is seen in Minkowski spacetime to be driven by the
ZPF in helical motions that we interpret to be spin. The theory has the potential to exhibit
the many-particle behavior of pair creation and annihilation as the Connective transformation
sometimes takes positive time intervals in the particle spacetime to negative time intervals in
Minkowski spacetime.

We will formulate Connectivity in the context of electromagnetism, where the particle
is assumed to be a massless electric charge and the vacuum ﬁelds are the ZPF. The approach
should be generalizable to the other vacuum ﬁelds (e.g., the color ﬁelds of the strong nuclear
force).

In the following we use the metric signature (

2 Massless charge equation of motion

A suitable equation for describing the motion of a massless charge can be derived as the massless
limit of the Lorentz force equation,

q
c
where q is the charge of the particle, c is the speed of light, and m is the particle mass (which
we will soon take to be zero). F µν is the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor of the impressed ﬁelds,
including the ZPF. The acceleration α and the velocity u are four-vectors. In terms of the usual
three-space acceleration a and velocity v we have

Note in (9) that only transverse forces accelerate the particle, consistent with condi-
tions (6) and (7). This is also consistent with the expectations of relativity. Since it is moving
at the speed of light, the particle should see a universe Lorentz contracted to two transverse
dimensions, so it can only be accelerated by forces from the side.

Equation (8) describes the motion of a massless charge in response to impressed elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. The charge moves at a constant speed (the speed of light) with a changing
direction given by (8). When the impressed ﬁelds include the ZPF, this motion may be regarded
as Schr¨odinger’s zitterbewegung. When a ﬁeld above the vacuum is applied, the charge will be
observed to drift in a preferred direction in its Zitterbewegung wander.

These eﬀects are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the trajectory of a
massless charge computed using equation (8). The electromagnetic ﬁelds inﬂuencing the motion
of the charge are a random realization of the ZPF (see Appendix A for a description of how
the random realization is generated) with a superimposed uniform electric ﬁeld in the vertical
direction (the driving ﬁeld), which is switched oﬀ after half of the total time duration of the
simulation. Note that the charge drifts upward in response to the driving ﬁeld. Figure 2 shows
the region of Figure 1 near the origin. Here we see that the ZPF drives the charge in a pseudo-
helical motion as in Schr¨odinger’s orbital angular momentum explanation for spin.

inertial behavior as charge
stops drifting when driving
ﬁeld is switched oﬀ.

Now equation (8) by itself does not exhibit inertia. As is illustrated in Figure 1 and
more clearly in Figure 3, when the driving ﬁeld is switched oﬀ, the charge stops drifting and
resumes a zero-mean random walk in the frame of the calculation. This non-inertial behavior is
at distinct odds with relativity.

3 The Connective transformation

The non-inertial behavior of the massless charge equation of motion (8) is in distinct violation
of relativity. The ZPF vacuum ﬁelds have the energy density frequency spectrum [7]

ρ(ω)dω =

¯hω3
2π2c3 dω .

(10)

The cubic frequency dependence of the ZPF spectrum endows it with Lorentz invariance; all
inertial frames see an isotropic ZPF. A Lorentz transformation will cause a Doppler shift of each
frequency component, but an equal amount of energy is shifted into and out of each frequency
bin. When there are no ﬁelds above the vacuum in an inertial frame, an observer in that frame
should expect to see a zero-mean random walk due to the isotropic ZPF. Thus, in the example
cited above, an observer in a frame co-moving with the average motion of the charge just before
the driving ﬁeld is switched oﬀ should expect to see continued zero-mean zitterbewegung in his
frame, whereas (8) produces zero-mean motion in whatever frame the calculation is performed
in. To have a consistent theory, Lorentz covariance must be restored.

We assume that (8) holds in the spacetime of the particle. We further assume that
in this spacetime, (8) is the equation of a null geodesic. The curvature is deﬁned by the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds in the particle’s history. Since the charge is assumed to be massless and
moving at the speed of light, we cannot use proper time as the aﬃne parameter of the geodesic
(proper time intervals vanish for null geodesics). However, normal time serves well as an aﬃne
parameter. Thus we replace (8) with

These equations can be solved for the metric of the particle’s spacetime, though not uniquely.
The equations (14) actually deﬁne a class of metrics. Further constraints are required to select
a particular solution from this class. In particular, the geodesic in the particle spacetime should
be a null curve as expected for a massless object. Using (14), the geodesic equation (11) can be
written as,

Note that (16), which is the zeroth equation of (11), is an equation for the parameter
m∗. Thus m∗ is not a constant, but rather varies in response to applied forces. The eﬀect is to
introduce time dilation (or Doppler shifting) in the energy-momentum four vector analogous to
the gravitational redshift of General Relativity.

Also note that inertia is not assumed here by our requirement that the particle travel
on a null geodesic. We do not restrict the motion of the particle, rather we simply use its motion
to deﬁne the spacetime and metric that the particle sees. It is only after the transformation to
Minkowski spacetime that inertial behavior appears.

To ﬁnd solutions of (14), we ﬁrst consider an inﬁnitesimal region about the charge,

and require

gµν = ηµν + gµν,ρdxρ

(18)

where ηµν is the ﬂat spacetime metric,

with the remaining terms given by symmetry. As we said, the solution (23) and (24) is not
unique, but it is in some sense the simplest one as it yields the equality of the connection terms
and the Lorentz forces in a term-by-term manner. We will show in the next section that this
metric has several desirable properties, particularly the generation of both inertia and spin. It
also implies a many-particle theory with pair creation and annihilation.

One interesting aspect of (24) is that it depends on the particle history through the
time integrations. This means that the spacetime of a particle is unique to it; two particles at
the same place at the same time will be in diﬀerent spacetimes if the history integrals of (24)
diﬀer (as they generally will).

A second interesting point is that the integration over longitudinal forces appears
within exponentials whereas the integration over transverse forces appears within oscillatory
trigonometric functions. The latter may account for pair creation and annihilation. The former
produces time dilation that, as we shall soon see, yields the eﬀect we know as inertia.

4 Inertia

We have shown in Figure 3 that the massless charge equation of motion (8) does not contain
the eﬀect of inertia. The formulation of the preceding section restores Lorentz covariance to the
theory through the geodesic equation (11), and thus we expect that the well-known eﬀects of
inertia should appear. Two of the simplest manifestations of inertia are hyperbolic motion of a

7

charge in the presence of a uniform electric ﬁeld and uniform motion following an impulse. We
now demonstrate these eﬀects.

Figure 4 displays the component of the motion of a charge in the direction of a uniform
electric ﬁeld applied above the ZPF, obtained by solving (11) using the metric (24) and applying
the Connective transformation to view the result in Minkowski spacetime. The solid curve is
the result of the Connectivity simulation. The circles lie on the hyperbola deﬁned by a massive
charge undergoing uniform acceleration in special relativity. The agreement is striking. Viewed
in Minkowski spacetime, the massless charge is seen to accelerate hyperbolically as though it
has inertia. Figure 5 is a similar depiction for the case in which an impulse has been applied to
the charge, and the charge is observed in Minkowski spacetime to continue in uniform motion
following the impulse. Here the circles lie on a straight line, indicating that the particle travels
at a constant speed following the impulse. Note that it is the average motion of the charge
that moves uniformly. Deviations about the average motion are apparent and are, in fact,
zitterbewegung driven by the ZPF. The average motion deﬁnes a timelike curve, as expected of
a massive particle. (That the metric (24) produces instantaneous motion on a null curve needs
to be veriﬁed since our equations assume a massless particle. From our numerical simulations,
this appears to be at least approximately true for the single-particle regime.)

In the simulations of Figures 4 and 5, we were careful to require that the charge
was never energized enough for particle pair creation to occur. This was done by initiating
the simulation with a suﬃciently large value of m∗. As is apparent in (23), if the particle is
energized suﬃciently by the ZPF plus driving ﬁeld, the Connective transformation can cause
positive time intervals in the particle’s spacetime to be transformed to negative time intervals
in Minkowski spacetime. This negative-time transport of the particle can be viewed as the

positive-time transport of its antiparticle. The multi-particle regime was avoided here so that
the inertia-generating aspect of Connectivity could be demonstrated without complication.

5 Discussion

The premise of the Connectivity approach is that charges are massless and move on null geodesics
in a spacetime whose curvature is deﬁned by equating the forces on the charge with the con-
nection terms in the geodesic equation. These forces include those of the underlying vacuum
ﬁelds. The metric of this spacetime deﬁnes a transformation to Minkowski spacetime, wherein
the charge is observed to exhibit inertial behavior.

The simple fact that the Connectivity premise yields the eﬀects of inertia from massless
charges is strong motivation to seriously consider other implications of the theory, especially with
regard to its potential to shed light on the basis of the quantum theory.

When the forces acting on the charge are the Lorentz forces due to the electromagnetic
vacuum ﬁelds (the ZPF), these drive the charge in zitterbewegung motion at the speed of light, in
agreement with the speed-of-light eigenvalues of the Dirac theory. When the charge moves with
a large average velocity in some direction, the zitterbewegung motion extends to a quasi-helical
motion that may be the basis of particle spin. This spin is undetermined until “measured” by
applying a ﬁeld that aligns the zitterbewegung into helical motion, which will either be oriented
with positive or negative helicity (spin up or spin down). Further work will be required to
determine whether it is possible for this “spin” to manifest the spin correlation properties of the
quantum theory.

It is implied by the Connective transformation (23) that the charge can be observed
in Minkowski spacetime to be travelling backward in time, or rather that its antiparticle is
travelling forward in time. Thus we have the basis for a many particle theory that manifests
the degrees of freedom of the Dirac theory (positive and negative energy states, each with spin
up/down conﬁgurations). The transformation (23) and its associated metric (24) may require
complex spacetime coordinates for calculation in the many-particle regime. Complex spacetime
may well provide the the necessary ingredient for Connectivity to realize a correspondence to
quantum interference.

There are a number of directions for further research that are implied by the Con-
nectivity premise. These include studying the correspondence of Connectivity with quantum
theory, the theory of electromagnetic radiation, and with gravitation theory.

For example, we suspect that it might be possible to derive the Schr¨odinger and
Dirac equations as stochastic equations obtained from the ensemble average of the Connective
transformation applied to the geodesic equation (11) in the single- and multi-particle regimes
respectively. Here it is likely that the ingredient of complex spacetime will be essential.

Since the interpretation of Connectivity is that electromagnetic ﬁelds deﬁne a cur-
vature of spacetime, it may be possible to show that radiation is related to the distortion of
spacetime required to connect the views of diﬀerent frames. This might then have implications
for the problem of the stability of atoms.

Exploring the relationship between the particle spacetime of Connectivity (which gen-
erates inertia) to the spacetime of General Relativity may shed light on Einstein’s postulate of
the Equivalence Principle. Among the things assumed in General Relativity are i.) the Equiva-

lence Principle, ii.) a spacetime with a metric which is well deﬁned even in the absence of matter
and energy, iii.) matter and energy, which are already assumed to have well deﬁned rest masses
and only distort the metric. Given these (with appropriate topology and boundary conditions),
the inertial frames are well deﬁned. However, the standard version of relativity does not explain
why the Equivalence Principle holds in the ﬁrst place, how the metric can be well deﬁned in an
empty spacetime (how do we measure motion without reference points?), and what are the rest
masses of the individual particles (or the weight of an object held up against gravity). In each
case, the solution of these problems may lie in considering the eﬀect of the vacuum as well as
that of the matter and energy above the vacuum. Even in an “empty” spacetime, vacuum ﬁelds
can provide spacetime events to which motion can be referred and acceleration with respect to
the vacuum can be detected. Secondly, according to Connectivity, interaction with the vacuum
endows individual particles with inertia and a corresponding eﬀective mass, possibly providing
a means of determining the individual rest masses. Finally, if we can derive inertial eﬀects from
interaction with the vacuum, it seems plausible that we should be able to similarly derive grav-
itational eﬀects, thereby yielding the equivalence principle and the Minkowski metric. Explicit
reference to (and interaction with) a real vacuum may provide reasonable explanations for the
fundamental assumptions of gravitation theory as represented in General Relativity.

6 Appendix A: ZPF Realizations

A convenient way to explore the properties of the massless charge equation of motion (8) and the
Connective transformation (23) is through numerical simulation. This requires the generation
of ZPF realizations. We use the prescription of Ibison and Haisch [8],

Here uk,λ and vk,λ are Gaussian random numbers with zero mean and unit variance, k is the
wave vector of a plane wave component of the ZPF, and λ is the polarization index. Gaussian
electromagnetic units have been used.

In generating random realizations of the ZPF, two practical considerations are forced
upon us. Although the ZPF may theoretically extend to inﬁnite frequencies, we must assume
a cutoﬀ frequency to build a numerical realization. There are physical reasons for applying a
cutoﬀ frequency, not in the ZPF per se, but in the charge’s response to the ZPF. This is related
to our spin interpretation of the orbital angular momentum of the helical ZPF-driven motion of
the charge. The value of this angular momentum is dependent on the presumed cutoﬀ frequency,
and for the electron this implies a cutoﬀ in the vicinity of the electron Compton frequency. The
simplest way to visualize this cutoﬀ is to assume that the charge has a ﬁnite spatial extent and
is not, in fact, a point singularity. It is then only inﬂuenced by the portion of the ZPF spectrum
with wavelengths longer than the charge distribution size. The second consideration aﬀecting
our random realizations is related to the size of the realization. Ideally one would generate a

10

complete space-time realization using (25) and (26), but since we want to consider frequencies
up to a cutoﬀ frequency near the electron Compton frequency and also consider comparatively
long time durations, computational memory storage becomes an issue.
In order to be able
to run the simulations on a very modest computer, we make the following compromise. We
generate a time-history realization at the point r = 0, but apply this realization to the charge
no matter where it is. Since the realization has the correct spectral properties in frequency, this
approximation can be expected to correctly give most of the behaviors we seek to demonstrate,
but we must realize that certain spatial correlation aspects may not be correctly represented.
Thus, for example, we see an orbital angular momentum emerging in our realizations of the
charge motion that we interpret to be spin, but if one wants to simulate spin correlation eﬀects
for comparison to the predictions of the quantum theory, the spatial aspect of (25) and (26)
should be included.

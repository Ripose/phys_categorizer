Abstract: Physics is introduced as a semantics of a formal set theory.

We consider a metatheory of a formal set theory S. We name this metatheory MS,
indicating that it is a Meta-theory of S as well as a Meta-Scientiﬁc theory as Ronald
Swan [1] refers to. The following arguments are all made in MS.

We deﬁne in MS

φ = the class of all well-formed formulae of S.

This φ is a countable set in the context of MS.

We identify φ with the set of truth values (in complex numbers C) of well-formed formulae
(wﬀ’s) in φ. In this identiﬁcation, we deﬁne a map T from φ to φ by

T (∧(q)) = the truth value of a well-formed formula [∧(q) and not ∧ (q)]

for q ⊂ φ, with ∧(q) denoting the conjunction of q.

We note that every subset q of φ becomes false by adding some well-formed formula f of
φ. Hence, the conjunction of q′ = q ∪ {f } is false and satisﬁes

T (∧(q′)) = ∧(q′).

In this sense, φ is a ﬁxed point of the map T .

Moreover, we have the followings.

1. In the sense that any subset q of φ is false if some well-formed formula is added to

q, φ is inconsistent.

2. As φ is the class of all possible well-formed formulae, φ is absolute.

3. As φ is the totality of well-formed formulae, φ includes the well-formed formula
whose meaning is that “φ is the class of all well-formed formulae in S” in some G¨odel
type correspondence between S and MS. In this sense φ includes (the deﬁnition of)
φ itself. Thus φ is self-referential and self-creative, and is self-identical, just
as in M. C. Escher’s lithograph in 1948, entitled “pencil drawing.”

The item 3 implies that φ is a non-well founded set or a hyperset.

The class φ is the ﬁrst world, the Universe, which is completely chaotic. In other words,
φ is “absolute inconsistent self-identity” in the sense of Kitarou Nishida [2], whose
meaning was later clariﬁed by Ronald Swan [1] in the form stated above. In this clariﬁ-
cation, φ can be thought “absolute nothingness” in Hegel’s sense.

The Universe φ is contradictory, and hence its truth value is constantly oscillating between
the two extremal values or poles, truth and false, or +1 and −1, or more generally, inside
a unit sphere of C. Namely, the class φ as a set of wﬀ’s of the set theory S is countable,
but the values which the elements of φ take vary on a unit sphere. In other words, the
Universe φ is a stationary oscillation, when we see its meaning.

Oscillation is expressed by exponential functions: exp(ix · p), where x = (x1, · · · , xd), p =
(p1, · · · , pd) ∈ Rd and x · p =

d
i=1 xipi.

This exp(ix · p) is an eigenfunction of the negative Laplacian −∆:

Namely

then

This is generalized to some extent. I.e. if a perturbation V = V (x) satisﬁes that

H = −∆ + V (x) is a self-adjoint operator on H = L2(Rd),

φ is expressed as an eigenfunction of H.

Considering the absolute nature of the Universe φ, we will be led to think that the
Hamiltonian H of φ is a Hamiltonian of inﬁnite degree of freedom on a Hilbert space:

U = {φ} =

(Hn = H ⊗ · · · ⊗ H

),

and the Universe φ is an eigenfunction of the total Hamiltonian H = Htotal.

Thus we arrive at our ﬁrst principle.

Axiom 1. The Universe is of inﬁnite nature, and it is eternal. In other words, the wave
function φ of the Universe satisﬁes with respect to the total Hamiltonian Htotal

for some non-positive real number λ ≤ 0.

Htotal φ = λφ

In every ﬁnite part of φ, a local existence in φ is expressed by a superposition of

exponential functions

for some natural number N = n + 1 ≥ 2 with n corresponding to the superscript n in Hn
of the deﬁnition of U above. The function g(p) is called Fourier transform of ψ(x) and
satisﬁes

g(p) = F ψ(p) := (2π)−d(N −1)/2

exp(−ip · y)ψ(y)dy.

A ﬁnite subset of wﬀ’s in φ corresponds to a partial Hamiltonian H of Htotal of ﬁnite
degree of freedom, as the content/freedom that is given by a ﬁnite number of wﬀ’s in φ
corresponds to a ﬁnite degree, n = N −1, of freedom of a partial wave function ψ(x) of the
total wave function φ. If such a partial Hamiltonian H of Htotal satisﬁes some conditions,
we can get a similar expansion of a local existence ψ(x) by using generalized eigenfunctions
of H. This is known as a spectral representation of H in a general setting, but we here are
speaking of a more speciﬁc expression called generalized Fourier transform or generalized
eigenfunction expansion associated with Hamiltonian H (originated by Teruo Ikebe [3]).

We call p momentum conjugate to x. More precisely we deﬁne momentum oper-
ator P = (P1, · · · , Pd) conjugate to conﬁguration operator X = (X1, · · · , Xd) (Xj =
multiplication operator by conﬁguration xj) by

Then P and X satisfy

Pj = F −1pjF =

(j = 1, · · · , d).

.

This shows that what we are dealing with is quantum mechanics. So to be in accordance
with actual observation, we modify the deﬁnition of P

where ¯h = h/(2π), and h is Planck constant. Accordingly, the Fourier and inverse Fourier
transformations are modiﬁed

F ψ(p) = g(p) = (2π¯h)−d(N −1)/2

exp(−ip · y/¯h)ψ(y)dy,

F −1g(x) = (2π¯h)−d(N −1)/2

exp(ix · p/¯h)g(p)dp.

To sum our arguments up to here, we have constructed quantum mechanics as a
semantics of the class φ of all well-formed formulae of a formal set theory S. Quantum
mechanics is, in this context, given as an interpretation of set theory.

We continue to complete our semantics of the Universe φ.

A local existence is of ﬁnite nature, and it is so local that it cannot know the existence
of the inﬁnite Universe, and is self-centered. In other words, a local coordinates system
starts from its own origin, and it is the self-centered origin of the local system. All things
are measured with respect to this local origin.

Therefore we have our second and third principles.

Axiom 2. A local system is of ﬁnite nature, having its own origin of position X and
momentum P , independent of others’ origins and others’ inside worlds.

Axiom 3. The nature of locality is expressed by a local Hamiltonian

A local existence (or local system) is oscillating as a sum or integral of generalized
eigenfunctions of H. In this sense, the locality or local system is a stationary oscillating
system.

A local oscillation may be an eigenfunction of the local Hamiltonian H. However,
by the very nature that locality is a self-centered existence of ﬁnite nature, it is shown
that it cannot be an eigenstate of H, or more precisely speaking, there is at least one
Universe wave function φ every part of which is not an eigenfunction of the local system
Hamiltonian H corresponding to the part. (See [6], [8]. See also [4], [5], [7].)

To express this oscillation explicitly in some “outer coordinate,” we force the locality
or local system to oscillate along an “afterward-introduced” real-valued parameter t. The
oscillation is then expressed by using the Hamiltonian H

exp(−2πitH/h).

This operator is known in QM (quantum mechanics) as the evolution operator of the local
system. We call it the local clock of the system, and we call t the local time of the system.
Using our self-centered coordinates of our local system in axiom 2, that is, letting x
be position coordinates and v = m−1P be velocity coordinates inside the local system
(m being some diagonal mass matrix), we can prove, by virtue of the fact that a local
oscillation ψ(x) is not an eigenfunction of H, that

as t tends to ±∞ along some sequence in some spectral decomposition of exp(−itH/¯h)ψ
(see [4]). This means that the word “local clock” is appropriate for the operator
exp(−itH/¯h) and so is “local time” for the parameter t. Therefore we also have seen
that “time” exists locally and only locally, exactly by the fact that locality is a self-
centered existence of ﬁnite nature. This fact corresponds to Ronald Swan’s statements in
page 27 of [1] “localization must be completely, or unconditionally, circumstantial” and
“localization is not self-creative.”

Once given the local time, the local system obeys Schr¨odinger equation

All up to now can be expressed on a Euclidean space Rd. We need not worry about

any curvature as we consider ourselves with respect to our own coordinates.

But when we look at the outside world, our view will be distorted due to the ﬁniteness
of our ability. As equivalent existences as localities, we are all subject to one and the
same law of distortion.

Among local systems, we thus pose a law of democracy.

Axiom 4. General Principle of Relativity. Physical worlds or laws are the same for all
local observers.

As a locality, we cannot distinguish between the actual force and the ﬁctitious force,
as far as the force is caused by the distortions that our confrontations to the outside world
produce.

We have thus the ﬁfth axiom.

Axiom 5. Principle of Equivalence. For any gravitational force, we can choose a coordi-
nate system (as a function of time t) where the eﬀect of gravitation vanishes.

Axioms 4 and 5 are concerned with the distortion of our view when we meet the
outside, while axioms 1–3 are about the inside world which is independently conceived
as its own. The oscillatory nature of local systems in axiom 3 is a consequence of the
locality of the system and the stationary nature of the Universe, so that the oscillation
is due to the intrinsic “internal” cause, while the distortion of our view to the outside is
due to observational “external” cause.

Those two aspects, the internal and the external aspects, are independent mutually,
because the internal coordinate system of a local system is a relative one inside the local
system and does not have any relation with the external coordinates. Therefore, when
we are inside, we are free from the distortion, while when we are meeting the outside,
we are in a state that we forget the inside and see a curved world. Thus axioms 1–5 are
consistent.

Quantum mechanics is introduced as a semantic interpretation of a formal set theory,
and general relativity is set as a democracy principle among ﬁnite, local systems. The

5

origin of local time is in this ﬁnitude of local existence, and it gives the general relativistic
proper time of each system.

Set theory is a purely inward thought. Physics obtained as semantics of the set theory
is a look at it from the outside. The obtained QM itself is a description of the inside
world that breeds set theory. The self-reference prevails everywhere and at every stage.

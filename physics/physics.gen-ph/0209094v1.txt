Abstract

I cast doubt upon the desired consistency between the anthropic prin-

ciple and modern cosmology.

Amongst all possible universes we live in one that deserves us. This is what
could be called the naive version of the anthropic principle. At what extent this
view is consistent with modern scientiﬁc results obtained from theoretical and
observational work in cosmology?

The anthropic principle was originally put forward by the cosmologist Bran-
don Carter (1974) with the statement that ‘our location in the universe is nec-
essarily privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as ob-
servers’. (The italic is mine). The deﬁnite status as a consensual principle of
nature has been crowned with the thorough account of its implications in seem-
ingly unpaired areas of human knowledge as philosophy, quantum mechanics,
cosmology, biochemistry, the search for extraterrestrial life and ultimately the
future of the universe, by John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler, in the now
classical book entitled The Anthropic Cosmological Principle (Barrow & Tipler
1986 but see Soares 2001).

Since then, two major achievements in cosmology lie on our pathway, two
brilliant milestones. On the theoretical side, Alan Guth invented the inﬂationary
theory (Guth 1997) in the early 80’s, and on the observational side, the ﬁrst
results from the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite were published in the
early 90’s 1. The expanding universe paradigm gained strength with renewed
blood from these sources. Two recent reviews by Michael S. Turner (2002) and
Max Tegmark (2002) give a clear picture of the present situation. The evidence
for a ﬂat global topology comes from both inﬂation and measurements of the
anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background on angular scales of about 1
degree. The measurements were triggered by COBE’s spectacular results, from
a plethora of satellite and balloon experiments (see Tegmark 2002).

Current cosmological models should be at least reassuring of an anthropic
universe. But, what does the cosmic budget tell us? Following Turner one has:

• Bright stars: 0.5%

• Baryonic dark matter: 3.5%

• Nonbaryonic dark matter: 30%

• Dark energy: 66%

Flatness requires that everything adds up to 100% of the closure density. Except
for a half per cent of visible, ordinary, observable matter, we are left with dark,
exquisite, unobservable stuﬀ.

Now, back right to the beginning: aren’t we in the wrong universe?

Abstract

After many fruitless decades of trying to unify electromagnetism
and gravitation, it is now being realized that this can be done only in
discrete spacetime, as indeed the author had demonstrated. In this
context, a uniﬁed description of gravitation and electromagnetism is
provided within the framework of a gauge like formulation. Following
the discrete spacetime structure, we then argue that the underpinning
for the universe is an array of Planck scale oscillators.

1 Introduction

In an earlier communication [1], based on a discrete spacetime noncommu-
tative geometrical approach, we had shown that it was possible to reconcile
electromagnetism and gravitation.
It is of course well known that nearly
ninety years of eﬀort has gone in to get a uniﬁed description of electromag-
netism and gravitation starting with Hermann Weyl’s original Gauge Theory.
It is only in the recent years that approaches in Quantum Gravity and Quan-
tum Super Strings, amongst a few other theories are pointing the way to a
reconciliation of these two forces. These latest theories discard the diﬀeren-
tiable spacetime of earlier approaches and rely on a lattice like approach to
spacetime, wherein there is a minimum fundamental interval which replaces
the point space time of earlier theories. Indeed as Hooft has remarked, “It
is some what puzzling to the present author why the lattice structure of

1

space and time had escaped attention from other investigators up till now....”
[2,3,4] Infact we had recently shown that within this approach, it is possible
to get a rationale for the de Broglie wavelength and Bohr-Sommerfeld quan-
tization relations as well[5]. Nevertheless, the link with the gauge theories of
other interactions, based as they are, on spin 1 particles, is not clear, because
the graviton is a spin 2 particle (or alternatively, the gravitational metric is
a tensor).

2 A Gauge like Formulation

In this latter context, we will now argue that it is possible for both elec-
tromagnetism and gravitation to emerge from a gauge like formulation. In
Gauge Theory, which is a Quantum Mechanical generalization of Weyl’s orig-
inal geometry, we generalize, as is well known, the original phase transfor-
mations, which are global with the phase λ being a constant, to local phase
transformations with λ being a function of the coordinates [6]. As is well
known this leads to a covariant gauge derivative. For example, the transfor-
mation arising from (xµ)

(xµ + dxµ),

→

ψe−ıeλ

ψ

→

(1)

leads to the familiar electromagnetic potential

∂µλ

Aµ →

Aµ −
The above transformation, ofcourse, is a symmetry transformation. In the
transition from (1) to (2), we expand the exponential, retaining terms only
to the ﬁrst order in coordinate diﬀerentials.
Let us now consider the case where there is a minimum cut oﬀ in the space
time intervals. As is well known this leads to a noncommutative geometry
(Cf.ref.[1])

(2)

[dxµ, dxν] = O(l2)
where l is the minimum scale. From (3) it can be seen that if O(l2) is ne-
glected, we are back with the familiar commutative spacetime. The new
eﬀects of fuzzy spacetime arise when the right side of (3) is not neglected.
Based on this the author had argued that it is possible to reconcile electro-
magnetism and gravitation [7,8,9,10]. If in the transition from (1) to (2) we

(3)

retain, in view of (3), squares of diﬀerentials, in the expansion of the function
λ we will get terms like

∂µλ

dxµ + (∂µ∂ν + ∂ν∂µ) λ

dxµdxν

{

}

·

(4)

where we should remember that in view of (3), the derivatives (or the prod-
uct of coordinate diﬀerentails) do not commute. As in the usual theory the
coeﬃcient of dxµ in the ﬁrst term of (4) represents now, not the gauge term
but the electromagnetic potential itself: Infact, in this noncommutative ge-
ometry, it can be shown that this electromagnetic potential reduces to the
potential in Weyl’s original gauge theory [6,7].
Without the noncommutativity, the potential ∂µλ would lead to a vanishing
electromagnetic ﬁeld. However Dirac pointed out in his famous monopole
paper in 1930 that a non integrable phase λ(x, y, z) leads as above directly
to the electromagnetic potential, and moreover this was an alternative for-
mulation of the original Weyl theory [11,12].
Returning to (4) we identify the next coeﬃcient with the metric tensor giving
the gravitational ﬁeld:

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν = (∂µ∂ν + ∂ν∂µ) λdxµdxν

(5)

Infact one can easily verify that ds2 of (5) is an invariant. We now specialize
to the case of the linear theory in which squares and higher powers of hαβ
can be neglected. In this case it can easily be shown that

2Γβ

µν = hβµ,ν + hνβ,µ −
where in (6), the Γs denote Christofell symbols. From (6) by a contraction
we have

hµν,β

(6)

If we use the well known gauge condition [13]

2Γµ

µν = hµν,µ = hµµ,ν

∂µ

hµν

(cid:18)

−

ηµνhµν

= 0, where h = hµ
µ

then we get

∂µhµν = ∂νhµ

µ = ∂νh

(8) shows that we can take the λ in (4) as λ = h, both for the electromag-
netic potential Aµ and the metric tensor hµν. (7) further shows that the Aµ

(7)

(cid:19)

so deﬁned becomes identical to Weyl’s gauge invariant potential [14].
However it is worth reiterating that in the present formulation, we have a
noncommutative geometry, that is the derivatives do not commute and more-
over we are working to the order where l2 cannot be neglected. Given this
condition both the electromagnetic potential and the gravitational potential
are seen to follow from the gauge like theory. By retaining coordinate diﬀer-
ential squares, we are even able to accommodate apart from the usual spin 1
gauge particles, also the spin 2 graviton which otherwise cannot be accom-
modated in the usual gauge theory. If however O(l2) = 0, then we are back
with commutative spacetime, that is a usual point spacetime and the usual
gauge theory describing spin 1 particles.
We had reached this conclusion in ref.[1], though from a diﬀerent, nongauge
point of view. The advantage of the present formulation is that it provides a
transparent link with conventional theory on the one hand, and shows how
the other interactions described by non Abelian gauge theories smoothly ﬁt
into the picture.
Finally it may be pointed out that the author had argued that a fuzzy space-
time input explains why the purely classical Kerr-Newman metric gives the
purely Quantum Mechanical anomalous gyromagnetic ratio of the electron
[15,16], thus providing a link between General Relativity and electromag-
netism. This provides further support to the above considerations.

3 Planck Scale Considerations

Let us now push the Planck scale considerations further. In an earlier com-
munication [17], we had argued that a typical elementary particle like a pion
could be considered to be the result of 1040 evanescent Planck scale particles.
The argument was based on random motions and also on the modiﬁcation to
the Uncertainity Principle. We will now consider the problem from a totally
diﬀerent point of view, which not only reconﬁrms the above result, but also
enables an elegant extension to the case of the entire universe itself. Let us
now consider an array of N particles, spaced a distance ∆x apart, which
behave like oscillators, that is as if they were connected by springs. We then
have [18,19]

We now identify the particles with Planck masses, set ∆x
a = lP , the
Planck length. It may be immediately observed that use of (11) and (10)
mP c2, which ofcourse agrees with the temperature of a black
gives kBT
hole of Planck mass. (Equations (10) and (11) deﬁne the spring constant k).
Indeed Rosen had shown that a Planck mass particle at the Planck scale can
be considered to be a universe in itself [20]. We also use the fact alluded
to that a typical elementary particle like the pion can be considered to be
the result of N
l, the
pion Compton wavelength as required. Further, in this latter case, using
(10),i.e. kBT = kl2/N and (11) and (12), we get for a pion, remembering
that m2

1040 Planck masses. Using this in (9), we get r

P /N = m2,

kBT =

which of course is the well known formula for the Hagedorn temperature for
elementary particles like pions. In other words, this conﬁrms the conclusions
in [1], that we can treat an elementary particle as a series of some 1040 Planck
mass oscillators. However it must be observed from (10) and (11), that while
the Planck mass gives the highest energy state, an elementary particle like
the pion is in the lowest energy state. This explains why we encounter el-
ementary particles, rather than Planck mass particles in nature. Infact as
already noted [21,22], a Planck mass particle decays via the Bekenstein ra-
10−42secs. On the other hand, the lifetime
diation within a Planck time
of an elementary particle would be very much higher.

∼

It must be mentioned that a fundamental minimum scale leads to viola-
tions of Lorentz symmetry - a topic that is being studied with much interest
with a large body of literature [23,24,25]. The eﬀects are in the nature of
small corrections which hopefully will be detectable in ultra high energy cos-
mic rays, at extreme energies, though perhaps not in earth based colliders
in the near future.
In any case the eﬃcacy of our above oscillator model
can be seen by the fact that we recover correctly the masses and Compton

5

scales in the order of magnitude sense and also get the correct Bekenstein
and Hagedorn formulas as seen above, and get the correct estimate of the
mass of the universe itself, as will be seen in the sequel. This is suﬃcient for
the present purpose.

It is interesting to note that the oscillator model has been used to give a
formula for the mass spectrum of all known elementary particles [26]. It may
be mentioned that Ng gives another interesting mass spectrum where impor-
tant particles are associated with prime numbers [27]. Another important
approach is that of Beck in which he uses stochastic quantization on chaotic
strings to deduce low energy Bosonic and Fermionic masses (Cf.refs.[28,29]).
1080 elementary particles
like the pions, the question is, can we think of the universe as a collection of
10120 Planck mass oscillators? This is what we will now show. Infact if we
use equation (9) with

Using the fact that the universe consists of n

we can see that the extent r
of the universe itself. Next using (12) we get

(13)

(where the multiplying factor on the left side viz., lP /r is dimensionless)
which gives the correct mass M, of the universe. We have started with (12),
taking r to be the radius of the universe to get the lowest energy state of the
oscillator system and then got in (13) the whole energy for the 10120 oscil-
lators. We get the same result if in (12) we take r to be the pion Compton
wavelength and compute the energy for the 1080 pions in the universe. In
other words the universe itself can be considered to be a normal mode of
Planck scale oscillators.

It may be pointed out that the number N

10120 has also featured in the
work of L. Nottale [30]. It is related to a scale dual to the minimum Planck
scale, something which arises from the modiﬁcation of the Uncertainty Prin-
ciple due to the minimum scale [31,32,33,34,35,36].

Finally it is interesting to note that equations like (9), which give the
famous Eddington formula and also leads to the well known so called large
number empirical coincidences of Dirac have received some attention in recent
times [37,38,39]. Interestingly all this has relevance to the recently discov-
ered variation of the supposedly constant ﬁne structure constant and related
problems [40,4142].

4 The Modiﬁed Uncertainty Principle

As we noted above, It is well known that with the minimum space time
interval, the Uncertainty Principle gets modiﬁed [43]. There is now an extra
or second term:

¯h
∆p
The ﬁrst term gives the usual Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We will
√N , in the
now relate the second term in (14) to large scale ﬂuctuations
1080 is the number of elementary particles encountered
universe, where N
earlier. Infact the second term gives with ∆x = R the radius of the universe,

where the total uncertainty in momentum is √N mc. Whence we have

On the other hand without any reference to the Modiﬁed Uncertainty Prin-
ciple, using the ﬂuctuation in the particle number above we have [44]

It can immediately be seen that (15) is the same as (16).
In other words the second term, and therefore the spacetime fuzziness, is
caused by the ﬂouctuation in the number of particles in the universe. Indeed
this was argued earlier from a diﬀerent standpoint [45]. We could equivalently
argue that the ﬁrst term is related to electromagnetism (and Quantum Me-
chanics) and the second term to gravitation. For this we note that we have,
for the gravitational energy

while for the electromagnetic energy we have

From (17) and (18) we have

If in (19) which is an equation in the “Large Number” spirit in which the
distinction between the electron and pion masses gets blurred [46], we use
the well known Eddington formula referred to earlier we get

which is the emperically well known formula comparing the gravitational and
electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths.

5 Remarks

It is interesting to note in the context of the above Planck scale oscillator
arrays, that in this case the energy is given by [2]

where (21) is a base energy, k the usual wave number (momentum) and l is
the spacing. What equation (21) shows is that we have

as l is small. From (22) we can conclude the following: If A = mc2 then l
will be the Compton scale as v approaches c. Alternatively A or v, given
the Compton (Planck) scale has the (minimum) scale, there is a maximal
attainable velocity c, imposed by the lattice structure. Another interesting
point is that in an equation like (13), if we use instead of the Planck con-
1093 as discussed extensively in the
stant, a scaled Planck constant H
∼
literature (Cf. for example [2]), then we recover consistently the frequency

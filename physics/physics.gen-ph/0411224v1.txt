Abstract

The concept of an all pervading Aether is age old, and contrary to
popular belief, it survived the twentieth century too though with dif-
ferent nuances. Using this concept of a background Quantum Vacuum,
the author in 1997 proposed a cosmological model with some resem-
blance to the Dirac cosmology, which correctly predicted a dark energy
driven accelerating universer with a small cosmological constant, as
was subsequently conﬁrmed by observation in 1998. Moreover the so
called Large Number coincidences including the mysterious Weinberg
formula are deduced in this theory, rather than being ad hoc. We
examine the concept of Aether in this context and indicate how this
dark energy may be harnessed.

1 Introduction

In 1997, when the ruling paradigm was dark matter and a decelarating uni-
verse, the author proposed a model based on the Zero Point Field dark energy
and an accelerating Universe with a small cosmological constant. Moreover,
in this theory, the empirically well known but otherwise inexplicable, so called
Large Number relations, including the mysterious Weinberg formula were de-
duced as consequences, rather than being ad hoc [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In 1998, the
observations of Perlmutter and others on distant supernovae conﬁrmed the
above scenario - this work was infact the Breakthrough of the Year 1998 of
the American Association for Advancement of Science’s Science Magazine

1

[6, 7, 8]. Subsequently observations by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey conﬁrmed the predomi-
nance of the new paradigmatic dark energy - this was the Breakthrough of
the Year 2003 [9].
We ﬁrst observe that the concept of a Zero Point Field (ZPF) or Quantum
Vacuum (or Aether) is an idea whose origin can be traced back to Max Planck
himself. Quantum Field Theory attributes the ZPF to the virtual Quantum
eﬀects of an already present electromagnetic ﬁeld [10]. What is the mysteri-
ous energy of supposedly empty vacuum?
It may sound contradictory to attribute energy or density to the vacuum.
After all vacuum is a total void. However, over the past four hundred years,
it has been realized that it may be necessary to replace the vacuum by a
medium with some speciﬁc physical properties. For instance Descartes the
seventeenth century French philosopher mathematician proclaimed that the
so called empty space above the mercury column in a Torricelli tube, that is,
what is called the Torricelli vacuum, is not a vacuum at all. Rather, he said,
it was something which was neither mercury nor air, something he called
aether.
The seventeenth century Dutch Physicist, Christian Huygens required such
a non intrusive medium like aether, so that light waves could propagate
through it, rather like the ripple waves on the surface of a pond. Hence the
word luminiferous aether.
In the nineteenth century the aether was rein-
voked. Firstly in a very intuitive way Faraday could conceive of magnetic
eﬀects in vacuum in connection with his experiments on induction. Based
on this, the aether was used for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in
Maxwell’s Theory of electromagnetism, which infact laid the stage for Special
Relativity. This aether was a homogenous, invariable, non-intrusive, mate-
rial medium which could be used as an absolute frame of reference atleast for
certain chosen observers. However the experiments of Michelson and Morley
towards the end of the nineteenth century, lead to its downfall, and thus
was born Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity in which there is no such
absolute frame of reference. The aether lay shattered once again.
Very shortly thereafter the advent of Quantum Mechanics lead to its rebirth
in a new and unexpected avatar. Essentially there were two new ingredients
in what is today called the Quantum Vacuum. The ﬁrst was a realization
that Classical Physics had allowed an assumption to slip in unnoticed: In
a source or charge free ”vacuum”, one solution of Maxwell’s Equations of

2

electromagnetic radiation is no doubt the zero solution. But there is also a
more realistic non zero solution. That is, the electromagnetic radiation does
not necessarily vanish in empty space.
The second ingredient was the mysterious prescription of Quantum Mechan-
ics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, according to which it would be
impossible to precisely assign momentum and energy on the one hand and
spacetime location on the other. Clearly the location of a vacuum with no
energy or momentum cannot be speciﬁed in spacetime.
This leads to what is called a Zero Point Field. For instance a Harmonic
Oscillator, a swinging pendulum for example, according to classical ideas
has zero energy and momentum in its lowest position. But the Heisenberg
Uncertainty endows it with a ﬂuctuating energy. This fact was recognized by
Einstein himself way back in 1913 who contrary to popular belief, retained
the concept of aether though from a diﬀerent perspective [11]. It also pro-
vides an understanding of the ﬂuctuating electromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuum.
From another point of view, according to classical ideas, at the absolute zero
of temperature, there should not be any motion. After all the zero is when
all thermodynamic motion ceases. But as Nernst, father of the third law of
Thermodynamics himself noted, experimentally this is not so. There is the
well known superﬂuidity due to Quantum Mechanical – and not thermody-
namic – eﬀects. This is the situation where supercooled Helium moves in a
spooky fashion [10].
This mysterious Zero Point Field or Quantum Vacuum energy has since been
experimentally conﬁrmed in eﬀects like the Casimir eﬀect which demonstrates
a force between uncharged parallel plates separated by a charge free medium,
the Lamb shift which demonstrates a minute oscillation of an electron orbit-
ing the nucleus in an atom-as if it was being buﬀetted by the Zero Point
Field- the anomalous Quantum Mechanical gyromagnetic ratio g = 2 and so
on [12]-[17],[18].
The Quantum Vacuum is a far cry however, from the passive aether of olden
days. It is a violent medium in which charged particles like electrons and
positrons are constantly being created and destroyed, almost instantly, infact
within the limits permitted by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for the
violation of energy conservation. One might call the Quantum Vacuum as
a new state of matter, a compromise between something and nothingness.
Something which corresponds to what the Rig Veda described thousands of
years ago: ”Neither existence, nor non existence.”

3

The Quantum Vacuum can be considered to be the lowest state of any Quan-
tum ﬁeld, having zero momentum and zero energy. The properties of the
Quantum Vacuum can under certain conditions be altered, which was not
the case with the erstwhile aether. In modern Particle Physics, the Quantum
Vacuum is responsible for phenomena like Quark conﬁnement, a property
whereby it would be impossible to observe an independent or free Quark, the
spontaneous breaking of symmetry of the electroweak theory, vacuum po-
larization wherein charges like electrons are surrounded by a cloud of other
opposite charges tending to mask the main charge and so on. There could
be regions of vacuum ﬂuctuations comparable to the domain structures of
feromagnets. In a ferromagnet, all elementary electron-magnets are aligned
with their spins in a certain direction. However there could be special regions
wherein the spins are aligned diﬀerently.
Such a Quantum Vacuum can be a source of cosmic repulsion, as pointed by
Zeldovich and others [19, 20]. However a diﬃculty in this approach has been
that the value of the cosmological constant turns out to be huge, far beyond
what is observed. This has been called the cosmological constant problem
[21].
There is another approach, sometimes called Stochastic Electrodynamics
which treats the ZPF as primary and attributes to it Quantum Mechani-
cal eﬀects [22, 23]. It may be re-emphasized that the ZPF results in the well
known experimentally veriﬁed Casimir eﬀect [24, 25]. We would also like to
point out that contrary to popular belief, the concept of aether has survived
over the decades through the works of Dirac, Vigier, Prigogine, String The-
oriests like Wilzeck and others [26]-[32]. As pointed out it appears that even
Einstein himself continued to believe in this concept [33].
We would ﬁrst like to observe that the energy of the ﬂuctuations in the
background electromagnetic ﬁeld could lead to the formation of elementary
particles. Indeed this was Einstein’s belief. As Wilzeck put it, [30], “Ein-
stein was not satisﬁed with the dualism. He wanted to regard the ﬁelds, or
ethers, as primary. In his later work, he tried to ﬁnd a uniﬁed ﬁeld theory, in
which electrons (and of course protons, and all other particles) would emerge
as solutions in which energy was especially concentrated, perhaps as singu-
larities. But his eﬀorts in this direction did not lead to any tangible success.”

2 The Zero Point Field

Let us see how this can happen. In the words of Wheeler [18], “From the
zero-point ﬂuctuations of a single oscillator to the ﬂuctuations of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld to geometrodynamic ﬂuctuations is a natural order of pro-
gression...”
Let us consider, following Wheeler a harmonic oscillator in its ground state.
The probability amplitude is

for displacement by the distance x from its position of classical equilibrium.
So the oscillator ﬂuctuates over an interval

ψ(x) =

1/4

mω
π¯h (cid:19)

(cid:18)

e−(mω/2¯h)x2

∆x

(¯h/mω)1/2

∼

The electromagnetic ﬁeld is an inﬁnite collection of independent oscillators,
with amplitudes X1, X2 etc. The probability for the various oscillators to
have emplitudes X1, X2 and so on is the product of individual oscillator
amplitudes:

ψ(X1, X2,

) = exp[

(X 2

)]

· · ·

wherein there would be a suitable normalization factor. This expression gives
the probability amplitude ψ for a conﬁguration B(x, y, z) of the magnetic ﬁeld
that is described by the Fourier coeﬃcients X1, X2,
or directly in terms
of the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration itself we have

P being a normalization factor. Let us consider a conﬁguration where the
magnetic ﬁeld is everywhere zero except in a region of dimension l, where it

is of the order of

We next argue that l will be the Compton length, this is the mean length of
ﬂuctuations. We note that as is well known, a background ZPF of the kind we
have been considering can explain the Quantum Mechanical spin half as also
the anomalous g = 2 factor for an otherwise purely classical electron [36, 37,
38]. The key point here is (Cf.ref.[36]) that the classical angular momentum
~r
m~v does not satisfy the Quantum Mechanical commutation rule for the
angular momentum ~J. However when we introduce the background Zero
Point Field, the momentum now becomes

~J = ~r

m = ~v + (e/2c)~r

where ~A0 is the vector potential associated with the ZPF and ~B is an external
magnetic ﬁeld introduced merely for convenience, and which can be made
vanishingly small.
It can be shown that ~J in (2) satisﬁes the Quantum Mechanical commutation
~J. At the same time we can deduce from (2)
relation for ~J

Relation (3) gives the correct Quantum Mechanical results referred to above.

(4) shows that the mean dimension of the region in which the ﬂuctuation
contributes is of the order of the Compton wavelength of the electron. By
relativistic covariance (Cf.ref.[36]), the corresponding time scale is at the
Compton scale.
In (1) above if l is taken to be the Compton wavelength of a typical ele-
mentary particle, then we recover its energy mc2, as can be easily veriﬁed.
As mentioned Einstein himself had believed that the electron was a result of
such condensation from the background electromagnetic ﬁeld (Cf.[39, 20] for
details).
We now very brieﬂy indicate the cosmology referred to in the introduction
(Cf.refs.[1]-[5],[40, 41]). Elementary particles are created from the ZPF as
above. If there are N elementary particles, then ﬂuctuationally a nett √N

In (6), M is the mass of the Universe, m the mass of a typical elementary

Diﬀerenciation of (7) and use of (6) and (5) then leads to a host of consistent

In (8) above, H is the Hubble constant, l the pion Compton length, ρ the
average density, Λ the cosmological constant and ρvac the vacuum density.
These relations include the empirically known so called Eddington formula,
the Weinberg formula and the well known (but otherwise ad hoc) electro-
magnetism - gravitational coupling constant.
It may also be mentioned that all this can be interpreted elegantly in terms
of underlying Planck oscillators in the Quantum Vacuum (Cf.refs.[42, 43]).
Finally, it may be mentioned that (8) shows that both Λ and H

3 Harnessing the ZPF?

Two of the earliest realisations of the ZPF as mentioned were in the form of
the Lamb shift and the Casimir eﬀect.

7

In the case of the Lamb shift, as is well known, the motion of an orbiting
electron gets aﬀected by the background ZPF. Eﬀectively there is an addi-
tioinal ﬁeld, over and above that of the nucleus. This additional potential,
as is well known is given by [44]

The additional energy

contributes to the observed Lamb shift which is
The essential idea of the Casimir eﬀect is that the interaction between the
ZPF and matter leads to macroscopic consequences. For example if we con-
sider two parallel metallic plates in a conducting box, then we should have a
Casimir force given by [45]

1000mc/sec.

∼

where A is the area of the plates and l is the distance between them. More
generally, the Casimir force is a result of the boundedness or deviation from
a Euclidean topology in the Quantum Vaccuum. These Casimir forces have
been experimentally demonstrated [46, 47, 48, 49].
Let us return to equation (1). The ZPF ﬂuctuations typically take place
within the time τ , a typical elementary particle Compton time as suggested
by (4). This begs the question whether such ubiquotous ﬁelds could be
tapped for terrestrial applications or otherwise.
We now invoke the well known result from macroscopic physics that the
current in a coil is given by

ı =

nBA
r∆t

(9)

where n is the numer of turns of the coil, A is its area and r the resistance.
Introducing (1) into (9) we deduce that a coil in the ZPF would have a
ﬂuctuating electric current given by

nA
r
Ofcourse, this would be a small eﬀect. But in principle it should be possible
to harness the current (10) using advanced technologies, possibly supercon-
ducting coils to minimize r.

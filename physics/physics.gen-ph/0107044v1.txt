A realization of Mach’s Principal:
Clock and rods - or something more fundamental?

D F Roscoe, Applied Mathematics Department,

Abstract

This paper is essentially a speculation on the realization of Mach’s Principle, and we came to the details of the
present analysis via the formulation of two questions: (a) Can a globally inertial space & time be associated with
a non-trivial global matter distribution? (b) If so, what are the general properties of such a global distribution?

These questions are addressed within the context of an extremely simple model universe consisting of particles
possessing only the property of enumerability existing in a formless continuum. Since there are no pre-speciﬁed
ideas of clocks and rods in this model universe, we are forced into two fundamental considerations, these being:
What invariant meanings can be given to the concepts of spatial displacement and elapsed time in this model
universe?
Brieﬂy, these questions are answered as follows: the spatial displacement of a particle is deﬁned in terms of its
changed relationship with the particle ensemble as a whole - this is similar to the man walking down a street who
can estimate the length of his walk by reference to his changed view of the street. Once the concept of invariant
spatial displacement is established, a corresponding concept of elapsed time then emerges in a natural way as
‘process’ within the system.

Thus, unlike for example, general relativity, which can be considered as a theory describing the behaviour of
speciﬁed clocks and rods in the presence of matter, the present analysis can be considered as a rudimentary -
but fundamental - theory of what underlies the concepts of clocks and rods in a material universe. In answer
to the original two questions, this theory tells us that a globally inertial space & time can be associated with a
non-trivial global matter distribution, and that this distribution is necessarily fractal with D = 2.

This latter result is compared with the results of modern surveys of galaxy distributions (typically, Joyce,
Montuori, Labini astro-ph/9901290, ApJ Lett 1999 and other refernces in this paper), which ﬁnd that such distri-
butions are quasi-fractal with D ≈ 2 on the small-to-medium scales, with the situation on the medium-to-large
scales being a topic of considerable debate. Accordingly, and bearing in mind the extreme simplicity of the model
considered, the observational evidence is consistent with the interpretation that the analysed point-of-view cap-
tures the cosmic reality to a good ﬁrst-order approximation. We consider the implications of these results.

Introduction

The ideas underlying what is now known as ‘Mach’s Principle’ can be traced to Berkeley (1710, 1721) for which a
good contemporary discussion can be found in Popper (1953). Berkeley’s essential insight, formulated as a rejection
of Newton’s ideas of absolute space, was that the motion of any object had no meaning except insofar as that motion

1

was referred to some other object, or set of objects. Mach (1960, reprint of 1883 German edition ) went much further
than Berkeley when he said I have remained to the present day the only one who insists upon referring the law of
inertia to the earth and, in the case of motions of great spatial and temporal extent, to the ﬁxed stars. In this way,
Mach formulated the idea that, ultimately, inertial frames should be deﬁned with respect to the average rest frame
of the visible universe.

It is a matter of history that Einstein was greatly inﬂuenced by Mach’s ideas as expressed in the latter’s The
Science of Mechanics ... (see for example Pais 1982) and believed that they were incorporated in his ﬁeld equations
so long as space was closed (Einstein 1950). The modern general relativistic analysis gives detailed quantitative
support to this latter view, showing how Mach’s Principle can be considered to arise as a consequence of the ﬁeld
equations when appropriate conditions are speciﬁed on an initial hypersurface in a closed evolving universe.
In
fact, in answer to Mach’s question asking what would happen to inertia if mass was progressively removed from the
universe, Lynden-Bell, Katz & Bicak (1995) point out that, in a closed Friedmann universe the maximum radius of
this closed universe and the duration of its existence both shrink to zero as mass is progressively removed. Thus, it
is a matter of record that a satisfactory incorporation of Mach’s Principle within general relativity can be attained
when the constraint of closure is imposed.

However, there is a hardline point of view: in practice, when we talk of physical space (and the space composed of
the set of all inertial frames in particular), we mean a space in which distances and displacements can be determined
- but these concepts only have any meaning insofar as they refer to relationships within material systems. Likewise,
when we refer to elapsed physical time, we mean a measurable degree of ordered change (process) occurring within
a given physical system. Thus, all our concepts of measurable ‘space & time’ are irreducibly connected to the
existence of material systems and to process within such systems - which is why the closed Friedmann solutions are
so attractive. However, from this, we can also choose to conclude that any theory (for example, general relativity
notwithstanding its closed Friedmann solutions) that allows an internally consistent discussion of an empty inertial
spacetime must be non-fundamental at even the classical level.

To progress, we take the point of view that, since all our concepts of measurable ‘space & time’ are irreducibly
connected to the existence of material systems and to process within such systems, then these concepts are, in
essence, metaphors for the relationships that exist between the individual particles (whatever these might be) within
these material systems. Since the most simple conception of physical space & time is that provided by inertial space
& time, we are then led to two simple questions:

Is it possible to associate a globally inertial space & time with a non-trivial global matter distribution and, if it

is, what are the fundamental properties of this distribution?

In the context of the simple model analysed, the present paper ﬁnds deﬁnitive answers to these questions so that:

A globally inertial space & time can be associated with a non-trivial global distribution of matter;

•

•

This global distribution is necessarily fractal with D = 2.

In the following, we construct a simple model universe, analyse it within the context of the basic questions posed,
and consider other signiﬁcant matters which arise naturally within the course of the development.

2 General overview

We start from the position that conceptions of an empty inertial spatio-temporal continuum are essentially non-
physical, and are incapable of providing sound foundations for fundamental theory. The fact that we have apparently

2

successful theories based exactly on such conceptions does not conﬂict with this statement - so long as we accept
that, in such cases, the empty inertial spatio-temporal continuum is understood to be a metaphor for a deeper
reality in which the metric (or inertial) properties of this spatio-temporal continuum are somehow projected out
of an unaccounted-for universal distribution of material. For example, according to this view, the fact that general
relativity admits an empty inertial spatio-temporal continuum as a special case (and was actually originally derived as
a generalization of such a construct) implies that it is based upon such a metaphor - and is therefore, according to this
view, not suﬃciently primitive to act as a basis from which fundamental theories of cosmology can be constructed.
By starting with a model universe consisting of objects which have no other properties except identity (and
hence enumerability) existing in a formless continuum, we show how it is possible to project spatio-temporal metric
properties from the objects onto the continuum. By considering idealized dynamical equilibrium conditions (which
arise as a limiting case of a particular free parameter going to zero), we are then able to show how a globally inertial
spatio-temporal continuum is necessarily identiﬁed with a material distribution which has a fractal dimension D = 2
in this projected space. This is a striking result since it bears a very close resemblance to the cosmic reality for the
low-to-medium redshift regime.

However, this idealized limiting case material distribution is distinguished from an ordinary material distribution
in the sense that the individual particles of which it is comprised are each in a state of arbitrarily directed motion, but
with equal-magnitude velocities for all particles - and in this sense is more like a quasi-photon gas distribution. For
this reason, we interpret the distribution as a rudimentary representation of an inertial material vacuum, and present
it as the appropriate physical background within which gravitational processes (as conventionally understood) can
be described as point-source perturbations of an inertial spatio-temporal-material background. We brieﬂy discuss
how such processes can arise.

2.1 Overview of the non-relativistic formalism

In order to clarify the central arguments and to minimize conceptual problems in this initial development, we assume
that the model universe is stationary in the sense that the overall statistical properties of the material distribution
do not evolve in any way. Whilst this was intended merely as a simplifying assumption, it has the fundamental
eﬀect of making the development inherently non-relativistic (in sense that the system evolves within a curved metric
three-space, rather than being a geodesic structure within a spacetime continuum).

The latter consequence arises in the following way: since the model universe is assumed to be stationary, then
there is no requirement to import a pre-determined concept of ‘time’ into the discussion at the beginning - although
the qualitative notion of a generalized ‘temporal ordering’ is assumed. The arguments used then lead to a formal
model which allows the natural introduction of a generalized temporal ordering parameter, and this formal model
is invariant with respect to any transformation of this latter parameter which leaves the absolute ordering of events
unchanged. This arbitrariness implies that the formal model is incomplete, and can only be completed by the
imposition of an additional condition which constrains the temporal ordering parameter to be identiﬁable with some
model of physical time. It is then found that such a model of physical time, deﬁned in terms of ‘system process’,
arises automatically from the assumed isotropies within the system. In summary, the assumption of stationarity
leads to the emergent concept of a physical ‘spatio-temporal continuum’ which partitions into a metric three-space
together with a distinct model of physical time deﬁned in terms of ordered material process in the metric three-space.
The fractal D = 2 inertial universe then arises as an idealized limiting case.

2.2 Overview of the relativistic formalism

The relativistic formalism arises as a natural consequence of relaxing the constraint of a stationary universe. The
if the
formalism is not considered in any detail here but, brieﬂy, its development can be described as follows:

3

universe is not stationary, then it is evolving - and this implies the need for a pre-determined concept of ‘time’ to
be included in the discussion at the outset. If this is deﬁned in any of the ways which are, in practice, familiar to
us then we can reasonably refer to it as ‘local process time’. Arguments which exactly parallel those used in the
stationary universe case considered in detail here then lead to a situation which is identical to that encountered in
in that historical case, the equations of motion include a local
the Lagrangian formulation of General Relativity:
coordinate time (which corresponds to our local process time) together with a global temporal ordering parameter,
and the equations of motion are invariant with respect to any transformation of this latter parameter which leaves
the ordering of ‘spacetime’ events unchanged. This implies that the equations of motion are incomplete - and the
situation is resolved there by deﬁning the global temporal ordering parameter to be ‘particle proper time’. The
solution we adopt for our evolving universe case is formally identical, so that everything is described in terms of a
metric ‘spacetime’. By considering idealized dynamical equilibrium conditions, we are led to the concept of an inertial
‘spacetime’ which is identical to the spacetime of special relativity - except that it is now irreducibly associated with
a fractally distributed relativistic ‘photon gas’.

3 The starting point

§

1, we oﬀered the view that the fundamental signiﬁcance of Mach’s Principle arises from its implication of the
In
impossibility of deﬁning inertial frames in the absence of material; or, as a generalization, that it is impossible to
conceive of a physical spatio-temporal continuum in the absence of material. It follows from this that, if we are
to arrive at a consistent and fundamental implementation of Mach’s Principle, then we need a theory of the world
according to which (roughly speaking) notions of the spatio-temporal continuum are somehow projected out of pri-
mary relationships between objects. In other words, we require a theory in which notions of metrical space & time
are to be considered as metaphors for these primary relationships. Our starting point is to consider the calibration
of a radial measure which conforms to these ideas.

Consider the following perfectly conventional procedure which assumes that we ‘know’ what is meant by a given
radial displacement, R say. On a large enough scale (> 108 light years, say), we can reasonably assume it is possible
to write down a relationship describing the amount of mass contained within a given spherical volume: say

where U is, in principle, determinable. Of course, a classical description of this type ignores the discrete nature
of real material; however, overlooking this point, such a description is completely conventional and unremarkable.
Because M obviously increases as R increases, then U is said to be monotonic, with the consequence that the above
relationship can be inverted to give

which, because (1) is unremarkable, is also unremarkable.

In the conventional view, (1) is logically prior to (2); however, it is perfectly possible to reverse the logical pri-
ority of (1) and (2) so that, in eﬀect, we can choose to deﬁne the radial measure in terms of (2) rather than assume
that it is known by some independent means.
If this is done then, immediately, we have made it impossible to
conceive of radial measure in the absence of material. With this as a starting point, we are able to construct a
completely Machian Cosmology in a way outlined in the following sections.

4 A discrete model universe

The model universe is intended as an idealization of our actual universe, and is deﬁned as follows:

•

•

•

•

it consists of an inﬁnity of identical, but labelled, discrete material particles which are primitive, possessing no
other properties beyond being countable;

‘time’ is to be understood, in a qualitative way, as a measure of process or ordered change in the model universe;

there is at least one origin about which the distribution of material particles is statistically isotropic - mean-
ing that the results of sampling along arbitrary lines of sight over suﬃciently long characteristic ‘times’ are
independent of the directions of lines of sight;

the distribution of material is statistically stationary - meaning that the results of sampling along arbitrary lines
of sight over suﬃciently long characteristic ‘times’ are independent of sampling epoch.

Although concepts of invariant spatio-temporal measurement are implicitly assumed to exist in this model universe,
we make no apriori assumptions about their quantitative deﬁnition, but require that such deﬁnitions should arise
naturally from the structure of the model universe and from the following analysis.

4.1 The invariant calibration of a radial coordinate in terms of counting primitive

objects.

At (2), we have already introduced, in a qualitative way, the idea that the radial magnitude of a given sphere can be
deﬁned in terms of the amount of material contained within that sphere and, in this section, we seek to make this
idea more rigorous. To this end, we note that the most primitive invariant that can be conceived is that based on
the counting of objects in a countable set, and we show how this fundamental idea can be used to deﬁne the concept
of invariant distance in the model universe.

The isotropy properties assumed for the model universe imply that it is statistically spherically symmetric about
the chosen origin. If, for the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the characteristic sampling times over which the
assumed statistical isotropies become exact are inﬁnitesimal, then the idea of statistical spherical symmetry gives
way to the idea of exact spherical symmetry - thereby allowing the idea of some kind of rotationally invariant radial
coordinate to exist. As a ﬁrst step towards deﬁning such an idea, suppose only that the means exists to deﬁne a
succession of nested spheres, S1
Sp, about the chosen origin; since the model universe with inﬁnitesimal
characteristic sampling times is stationary, then the ﬂux of particles across the spheres is such that these spheres will
always contain ﬁxed numbers of particles, say N1, N2, ..., Np respectively.

S2

...

⊂

⊂

Since the only invariant quantity associated with any given sphere, S say, is the number of material particles con-
tained within it, N say, then the only way to associate an invariant radial coordinate, r say, with S is to deﬁne it
according to r = r0f (N ) where r0 is a ﬁxed scale-constant having units of ‘length’, and the function f is restricted
by the requirements f (Na) > f (Nb) whenever Na > Nb, f (N ) > 0 for all N > 0, and f (0) = 0. To summarize, an
invariant calibration of a radial coordinate in the model universe is given by r = r0f (N ) where:

f (Na) > f (Nb) whenever Na > Nb;

f (N ) > 0 for all N > 0 and f (0) = 0.

•

•

Once a radial coordinate has been invariantly calibrated, it is a matter of routine to deﬁne a rectangular coordinate
system based upon this radial calibration; this is taken as done for the remainder of this paper.

4.2 The mass model

At this stage, since no notion of ‘inertial frame’ has been introduced then the idea of ‘inertial mass’ cannot be deﬁned.
However, we have assumed the model universe to be composed of a countable inﬁnity of labelled - but otherwise
indistinguishable - material particles so that we can associate with each individual particle a property called ‘mass’
which quantiﬁes the amount of material in the particle, and is represented by a scale-constant, m0 say, having units
of ‘mass’.

The radial parameter about any point is deﬁned by r = r0f (N ); since this function is constrained to be mono-
tonic, then its inverse exists so that, by deﬁnition, N = f −1(r/r0); suppose we now introduce the scale-constant m0,
then N m0 = m0f −1(r/r0)
M (r) can be interpreted as quantifying the total amount of material inside a sphere of
radius r centred on the assumed origin. Although r = r0f (N ) and M (r) = N m0 are equivalent, the development
which follows is based upon using M (r) as a description of the mass distribution given as a function of an invariant
radial distance parameter, r, of undeﬁned calibration.

≡

It is clear from the foregoing discussion that r is deﬁned as a necessarily discrete parameter. However, to en-
able the use of familiar techniques, it will hereafter be supposed that r represents a continuum - it being understood
that a fully consistent treatment will require the use of discrete mathematics throughout.

5 The absolute magnitudes of arbitrary displacements in the model

universe

We have so far deﬁned, in general terms, an invariant radial coordinate calibration procedure in terms of the radial
distribution of material valid from the assumed origin, and have noted that such a procedure allows a routine
deﬁnition of orthogonal coordinate axes. Whilst this process has provided a means by which arbitrary displacements
can be described relative to the global material distribution, it does not provide the means by which an invariant
magnitude can be assigned to such displacements - that is, there is no metric deﬁned for the model universe. In the
following, we show how the notion of ‘metric’ can be considered to be projected from the mass distribution.

5.1 Change in perspective as an general indicator of displacement in a material uni-

verse

•

•

In order to understand how the notion of ‘metric’ can be deﬁned, we begin by noting the following empirical
circumstances from our familiar world:

In reality, an observer displaced from one point to another recognizes the fact of his own spatial displacement
by reference to his changed perspective of his (usually local) material universe;

the magnitude of this change in perspective provides a measure of the magnitude of his own spatial displacement.

To be more speciﬁc, consider an idealized scene consisting of a distributed set of many labelled points all in a static
relationship with respect to each other, plus an observer of this scene. Since the labelled points are in a static
relationship to each other, then a subset of them can be used to deﬁne a reference frame within which all of the other
labelled points in the scene occupy ﬁxed positions. The speciﬁcation of the observer’s directions-of-view onto any two
of the labelled points in this scene (which are not colinear with him!) uniquely ﬁxes the observer’s position and hence
his perspective of the whole scene. Correspondingly, the starting and ﬁnishing points of any journey undertaken by

6

the observer can be speciﬁed by the initial and ﬁnal directions-of-view onto each of the two chosen labelled points,
and the journey itself can be given an invariant description purely in terms of these initial and ﬁnal directions-of-view
conditions - that is, in terms of the observer’s changed perspective of the whole scene.

To summarize, an observer’s perspective of a scene can be considered deﬁned by his coordinate position in the
deﬁned reference frame plus a direction of view onto a speciﬁed labelled point within the scene, and an invariant
description of any journey made by the observer of the scene can given in terms of change in this perspective. In the
following, we show exactly how the concept of ‘change in perspective’ can be used to associated invariant magnitudes
to coordinate displacements in the model universe.

5.2 Perspective in the model universe

Since, in the present case, we are seeking to give invariant meaning to the displacement of an arbitrarily chosen
particle in the model universe, then we replace the journeying observer of the foregoing static scene by the chosen
particle itself. Additionally, given that the chosen particle lies initially on the constant-mass surface (r = constant)
of the mass-model, M (r), then we replace the static scene itself by the collection of particles contained within this
constant-mass surface.

To deﬁne perspective information for the chosen particle, we note that there is only one distinguished point in the
model universe, and that is the origin of the mass-model. Consequently, the most obvious possibility for perspective
information is given by the direction-of-view from the chosen particle onto the mass-model origin. Noting how
the speciﬁcation of a constant-mass surface plus the direction to the origin uniquely ﬁxes the position of the chosen
particle in the model universe, we conclude that this particle’s perspective of the model universe is completely deﬁned
by its constant-mass surface plus its direction-of-view onto the mass-model origin.
Finally, we note that, subject to the magnitude of the normal gradient vector,

, being a monotonic function
|
of r, total perspective information is precisely carried by the normal gradient vector itself. This follows since the
means that this magnitude is in a 1:1 relation with r and so can be considered to
assumed monotonicity of
M is always radial, and so deﬁnes
deﬁne which constant-mass surface is observed; simultaneously, the direction of
the direction-of-view from the chosen particle onto the mass-model origin.

So, to summarize, the perspective of the chosen particle can be considered deﬁned by the normal gradient vec-
tor, n

M , at the particle’s position.

5.3 Change in perspective in the model universe

We now consider the change in perspective arising from an inﬁnitesimal change in coordinate position: deﬁning the
components of the normal gradient vector (the perspective) as na ≡ ∇aM, a = 1, 2, 3, then the change in perspective
for a coordinate displacement dr

(dx1, dx2, dx3) is given by

≡
dna =

∇j(

∇aM )dxj

≡

gjadxj,

gab ≡ ∇a∇bM,

(3)

for which it is assumed that the geometrical connections required to give this latter expression an unambiguous
meaning will be deﬁned in due course. Given that gab is non-singular, we now note that (3) provides a 1:1 relation-
ship between the contravariant vector dxa (deﬁning change in the observer’s coordinate position) and the covariant
vector dna (deﬁning the corresponding change in the observer’s perspective). It follows that we can deﬁne dna as
the covariant form of dxa, so that gab automatically becomes the mass model metric tensor. The scalar product
dS2
dnidxi is then the absolute magnitude of the coordinate displacement, dxa, deﬁned relative to the change in
perspective arising from the coordinate displacement.

≡

7

The units of dS2 are easily seen to be those of mass only and so, in order to make them those of length2 - as
dimensional consistency requires - we deﬁne the working invariant as ds2
0/m0)dS2, where r0 and m0 are
scaling constants for the distance and mass scales respectively and the numerical factor has been introduced for later
convenience.

to behave sensibly in the sense that ds2 = 0 only when dr = 0, then we must replace the condition of non-singularity
of gab by the condition that it is strictly positive (or negative) deﬁnite; in the physical context of the present problem,
this will be considered to be a self-evident requirement.

5.4 The connection coeﬃcients

We have assumed that the geometrical connection coeﬃcients can be deﬁned in some sensible way. To do this, we
simply note that, in order to deﬁne conservation laws (ie to do physics) in a Riemannian space, it is necessary to be
have a generalized form of Gausses’ divergence theorem in the space. This is certainly possible when the connections
are deﬁned to be the metrical connections, but it is by no means clear that it is ever possible otherwise. Consequently,
the connections are assumed to be metrical and so gab, given at (3), can be written explicitly as

7 An invariant calibration of the radial scale

So far, we have assumed an arbitrary calibration for the radial scale; that is, we have assumed only that r =
f (M ) where f is an arbitrary monotonic increasing function of the mass, M . We seek to ﬁnd the calibration that
incorporates the physical content (that is, the perspective information) of the metric tensor deﬁned at (6).

which, for the particular case m1 = 0 becomes M = m0(r/r0)2. Reference to (6) shows that, with this mass
distribution and d0 = 1, then gab = δab so that the metric space becomes Euclidean. Thus, whilst we have yet
to show that a globally inertial space can be associated with a non-trivial global matter distribution (since no
temporal dimension, and hence no dynamics has been introduced), we have shown that a globally Euclidean space
can be associated with a non-trivial matter distribution, and that this distribution is necessarily fractal with D = 2.

Note also that, on a large enough scale and for arbitrary values of m1, (10) shows that radial distance varies as
the square-root of mass from the chosen origin - or, equivalently, the mass varies as r2. Consequently, on suﬃ-
ciently large scales Euclidean space is irreducibly related to a quasi-fractal, D = 2, matter distributions. Since

8 The temporal dimension

So far, the concept of ‘time’ has only entered the discussion in the form of the qualitative deﬁnition given in
§
has not entered in any quantitative way and, until it does, there can be no discussion of dynamical processes.

4 - it

Since, in its most general deﬁnition, time is a parameter which orders change within a system, then a necessary
pre-requisite for its quantitative deﬁnition in the model universe is a notion of change within that universe, and the
only kind of change which can be deﬁned in such a simple place as the model universe is that of internal change
arising from the spatial displacement of particles. Furthermore, since the system is populated solely by primitive
particles which possess only the property of enumerability (and hence quantiﬁcation in terms of the amount of ma-
terial present) then, in eﬀect, all change is gravitational change. This fact is incorporated into the cosmology to
be derived by constraining all particle displacements to satisfy the Weak Equivalence Principle. We are then led to
a Lagrangian description of particle motions in which the Lagrange density is degree zero in its temporal-ordering
parameter. From this, it follows that the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations form an incomplete set.

The origin of this problem traces back to the fact that, because the Lagrangian density is degree zero in the temporal
ordering parameter, it is then invariant with respect to any transformation of this parameter which preserves the
ordering. This implies that, in general, temporal ordering parameters cannot be identiﬁed directly with physical time
- they merely share one essential characteristic. This situation is identical to that encountered in the Lagrangian
formulation of General Relativity; there, the situation is resolved by deﬁning the concept of ‘particle proper time’.
In the present case, this is not an option because the notion of particle proper time involves the prior deﬁnition of
a system of observer’s clocks - so that some notion of clock-time is factored into the prior assumptions upon which
General Relativity is built.

In the present case, it turns out that the isotropies already imposed on the system conspire to provide an auto-
matic resolution of the problem which is consistent with the already assumed interpretation of ‘time’ as a measure
of ordered change in the model universe. To be speciﬁc, it turns out that the elapsed time associated with any
given particle displacement is proportional, via a scalar ﬁeld, to the invariant spatial measure attached to that dis-
placement. Thus, physical time is deﬁned directly in terms of the invariant measures of process within the model
universe.

9 Dynamical constraints in the model universe

Firstly, and as already noted, the model universe is populated exclusively by primitive particles which possess solely
the property of enumeration, and hence quantiﬁcation. Consequently, all motions in the model universe are eﬀectively
gravitational, and we model this circumstance by constraining all such motions to satisfy the Weak Equivalence
Principle by which we mean that the trajectory of a body is independent of its internal constitution. This constraint
can be expressed as:

C1 Particle trajectories are independent of the speciﬁc mass values of the particles concerned;

Secondly, given the isotropy conditions imposed on the model universe from the chosen origin, symmetry arguments
lead to the conclusion that the net action of the whole universe of particles acting on any given single particle is such
that any net acceleration of the particle must always appear to be directed through the coordinate origin. Note that
this conclusion is independent of any notions of retarded or instantaneous action. This constraint can then be stated
as:

C2 Any acceleration of any given material particle must necessarily be along the line connecting the
particular particle to the coordinate origin.

10 Gravitational trajectories

Suppose p and q are two arbitrarily chosen point coordinates on the trajectory of the chosen particle, and suppose
that (4) is integrated between these points to give the scalar invariant

I(p, q) =

(11)

Then, in accordance with the foregoing interpretation, I(p, q) gives a scalar record of how the particle has moved
between p and q deﬁned with respect to the particle’s continually changing relationship with the mass model, M (r).
Now suppose I(p, q) is minimized with respect to choice of the trajectory connecting p and q, then this minimizing
trajectory can be interpreted as a geodesic in the Riemannian space which has gab as its metric tensor. Given that
gab is deﬁned in terms of the mass model M (r) - the existence of which is independent of any notion of ‘inertial
mass’, then the existence of the metric space, and of geodesic curves within it, is likewise explicitly independent of
any concept of inertial-mass. It follows that the identiﬁcation of the particle trajectory r with these geodesics means
that particle trajectories are similarly independent of any concept of inertial mass, and can be considered as the
modelling step deﬁning that general subclass of trajectories which conform to that characteristic phenomenology of
gravitation deﬁned by condition C1 of

However, noting that the variational principle, (11), is of order zero in its temporal ordering parameter, we can
conclude that the principle is invariant with respect to arbitrary transformations of this parameter; in turn, this
means that the temporal ordering parameter cannot be identiﬁed with physical time. This problem manifests itself
formally in the statement that the equations of motion (13) do not form a complete set, so that it becomes necessary
to specify some extra condition to close the system.

A similar circumstance arises in General Relativity theory when the equations of motion are derived from an
action integral which is formally identical to (11). In that case, the system is closed by specifying the arbitrary time
parameter to be the ‘proper time’, so that

Consider C2, which states that any particle accelerations must necessarily be directed through the coordinate origin.

14 A discussion of the potential function

•

•

It is clear from (22) that m1 plays the role of the mass of the central source which generates the potential, V . A
relatively detailed description of the behaviour of V is given in appendix C, where we ﬁnd that there are two distinct
classes of solution depending on the free parameters of the system. These classes can be described as:

A constant potential universe within which all points are dynamically indistinguishable; this corresponds to an
inertial material universe, and arises in the case m1 = 0, d0 = 1;

All other possibilities give rise to a ‘distinguished origin’ universe in which either:

– there is a singularity at the centre, r = 0;
– or there is no singularity at r = 0 and, instead, the origin is the centre of a non-trivial sphere of radius
Rmin > 0 which acts as an impervious boundary between the exterior universe and the potential source.
In eﬀect, this sphere provides the source with a non-trivial spatial extension so that the classical notion
of the massive point-source is avoided.

Of these possibilities, the constant potential universe is the one which provides positive answers to our originally
posed questions, and it is this which is discussed in detail in the following sections.

However, of the two cases in the distinguished origin universe, the no-singularity case oﬀers the interesting
possibility of being able to model the gravitational eﬀects created by a central massive source, but without the
non-physical singularity at the origin. This case is mentioned here for future reference.

15 The fractal D = 2 inertial universe

Reference to (22) shows that the parameter choice m1 = 0 and d0 = 1 makes the potential function constant
everywhere, whilst (10) shows how, for this case, universal matter in an equilibrium universe is necessarily distributed
as an exact fractal with D = 2. Thus, the fractal D = 2 material universe is necessarily a globally inertial equilibrium
universe, and the questions originally posed in

1 are ﬁnally answered.

15.1 Implications for theories of gravitation

Given that gravitational phenomena are usually considered to arise as mass-driven perturbations of ﬂat inertial
backgrounds, then the foregoing result - to the eﬀect that the inertial background is necessarily associated with a
non-trivial fractal matter distribution - must necessarily give rise to completely new perspectives about the nature
1515.2, the kinematics in this inertial universe
and properties of gravitational phenomena. However, as we show in
is unusual, and suggests that the inertial material distribution is more properly interpreted as a quasi-photon fractal
gas out of which (presumably) we can consider ordinary material to condense in some fashion.

§

15.2 The quasi-photon fractal gas

For the case m1 = 0, d0 = 1, the deﬁnition M at (10) together with the deﬁnitions of A and B in

so that, by (20) (remembering that g0

for all displacements in the model universe. It is (almost) natural to assume that the constant v2
0 in (23) simply
refers to the constant velocity of any given particle, and likewise to assume that this can diﬀer between particles.
However, each of these assumptions would be wrong since - as we now show - v2
0 is, ﬁrstly, more properly interpreted
as a conversion factor from spatial to temporal units and, secondly, is a global constant which applies equally to all
particles.

To understand these points, we begin by noting that (23) is a special case of (16) and so, by (17), is more

accurately written as

which, by the considerations of
1212.2, we recognize as the deﬁnition of the elasped time experienced by any
particle undergoing a spatial displacement dr in the model inertial universe. Since this universe is isotropic about all
points, then there is nothing which can distinguish between two separated particles (other than their separateness)
undergoing displacements of equal magnitudes; consequently, each must be considered to have experienced equal
elapsed times. It follows from this that v2
0 is not to be considered as a locally deﬁned particle velocity, but is a
globally deﬁned constant which has the eﬀect of converting between spatial and temporal units of measurement.

§

We now see that the model inertial universe, with (24) as a global relationship, bears a close formal resemblance
to a universe ﬁlled purely with Einsteinien photons - the diﬀerence being, of course, that the particles in the model
inertial universe are assumed to be countable and to have mass properties. This formal resemblance means that the
model inertial universe can be likened to a quasi-photon fractal gas universe.

16 A quasi-fractal mass distribution law, M

r2: the evidence

≈

A basic assumption of the Standard Model of modern cosmology is that, on some scale, the universe is homogeneous;
however, in early responses to suspicions that the accruing data was more consistent with Charlier’s conceptions of an
hierarchical universe (Charlier, 1908, 1922, 1924) than with the requirements of the Standard Model, de Vaucouleurs
r1.3, whilst Peebles
(1970) showed that, within wide limits, the available data satisﬁed a mass distribution law M
r1.23. The situation, from the point of view of the Standard Model, has continued to deteriorate
(1980) found M
with the growth of the data-base to the point that, (Baryshev et al (1995))

≈

≈

15

...the scale of the largest inhomogeneities (discovered to date) is comparable with the extent of the surveys,
so that the largest known structures are limited by the boundaries of the survey in which they are detected.

For example, several recent redshift surveys, such as those performed by Huchra et al (1983), Giovanelli and Haynes
(1986), De Lapparent et al (1988), Broadhurst et al (1990), Da Costa et al (1994) and Vettolani et al (1994) etc have
discovered massive structures such as sheets, ﬁlaments, superclusters and voids, and show that large structures are
common features of the observable universe; the most signiﬁcant conclusion to be drawn from all of these surveys is
that the scale of the largest inhomogeneities observed is comparable with the spatial extent of the surveys themselves.
In recent years, several quantitative analyses of both pencil-beam and wide-angle surveys of galaxy distributions
have been performed: three recent examples are give by Joyce, Montuori & Labini (1999) who analysed the CfA2-
South catalogue to ﬁnd fractal behaviour with D = 1.9
0.1; Labini & Montuori (1998) analysed the APM-Stromlo
0.1, whilst Labini, Montuori & Pietronero (1998) analysed the Perseus-
survey to ﬁnd fractal behaviour with D = 2.1
Pisces survey to ﬁnd fractal behaviour with D = 2.0
0.1. There are many other papers of this nature in the literature
all supporting the view that, out to medium depth at least, galaxy distributions appear to be fractal with D

2.

±

±

±

This latter view is now widely accepted (for example, see Wu, Lahav & Rees (1999)), and the open question has
become whether or not there is a transition to homogeneity on some suﬃciently large scale. For example, Scaramella
et al (1998) analyse the ESO Slice Project redshift survey, whilst Martinez et al (1998) analyse the Perseus-Pisces,
the APM-Stromlo and the 1.2-Jy IRAS redshift surveys, with both groups ﬁnding evidence for a cross-over to
homogeneity at large scales. In response, the Scaramella et al analysis has been criticized on various grounds by
Joyce et al (1999).

So, to date, evidence that galaxy distributions are fractal with D

2 on small to medium scales is widely
accepted, but there is a lively open debate over the existence, or otherwise, of a cross-over to homogeneity on large
scales.

≈

To summarize, there is considerable debate centered around the question of whether or not the material in the
universe is distributed fractally or not, with supporters of the big-bang picture arguing that, basically, it is not,
2. This latter
whilst the supporters of the fractal picture argue that it is with the weight of evidence supporting D
position corresponds exactly with the picture predicted by the present approach.

17 Summary and Conclusions

Prompted by the questions

Is it possible to associate a globally inertial space & time with a non-trivial global matter distribution and, if it
is, what are the fundamental properties of this distribution?

we have analysed a very simple model universe, consisting solely of an inﬁnite ensemble of particles, possessing
only the property of enumerability, existing in a formless continuum and with the ensemble being in a statistically
stationary state. No concepts of rods or clocks were imported into this system, and we required that invariant
meanings for spatial and temporal intervals should arise from within the ensemble itself.

The notion of the spatial displacement of a particle was given meaning using our common experience - according
to which we recognize our own spatial displacements, and their magnitudes, by making reference to our changed
views of our local environment and the magnitudes of such changes - and not by referral to formal measuring rods.
The formal modelling of this experience led, in

77.2, to the conclusions that, within the model universe:

•

On suﬃciently large scales, space is necessarily Euclidean (to any required degree of approximation) and is
irreducibly associated with a quasi-fractal, D = 2, distribution of material within the model universe.

§

16

•

In the ideal limiting case of a particular parameter going to zero, space is necessarily identically Euclidean and
is irreducibly related to a fractal, D = 2, distribution of material within the model universe.

This procedure then led, via symmetry arguments, to a formal deﬁnition of ‘elapsed time’ within the model universe
as an invariant measure of ordered process within that universe. It is to be noted that this is in accord with the way
in which we actually experience the passage of time in our lives - as the accumulation of ordered process, and not
by continual reference to formal cyclic clocks.

With these deﬁnitions of invariant spatial displacement and invariant elapsed time in place, we were then able to

answer the original two questions within the context of the model universe so that, ﬁnally, we could say:

•

•

On suﬃciently large scales, space & time is necessarily inertial (to any required degree of approximation), and
is irreducibly associated with a quasi-fractal, D = 2, distribution of material within the model universe;

In the ideal limiting case of a particular parameter going to zero, a globally inertial space & time is irreducibly
related to a fractal, D = 2, distribution of material within the model universe.

However, the latter ideal inertial universe is distinguished in the sense that whilst all the particles within it have
arbitrarily directed motions, the particle velocities all have equal magnitude. In this sense, the globally inertial model
universe is more accurately to be considered as a quasi-photon gas universe than the universe of our macroscopic
experience. In other words, it looks more like a crude model of a material vacuum than the universe of our direct
experience.

This result is to be compared with the distribution of galaxies in our directly observable universe which approxi-
2 on the small-to-medium
mates very closely perfectly inertial conditions, and which appears to be fractal with D
scale at least. If we make the simple assumption that the distribution of ponderable matter traces the distribution
of the material vacuum then, given the extreme simplicity of the analysed model, this latter correspondence between
between the model’s statements and the cosmic reality lends strong support to the idea that our intuitively experi-
enced perceptions of physical space and time are projected out of relationships, and changing relationships, between
the particles (whatever these might be) in the material universe in very much the way described.

≈

The foregoing considerations have fundamental consequences for gravitation theory: speciﬁcally, since gravita-
tional phenomena are conventionally considered to arise as mass-driven perturbations of a ﬂat inertial background,
then the phenomonology predicted by the analysis - that a ﬂat inertial background is irreducibly associated with
a non-trivial fractal distribution of material - must necessarily lead to novel insights into the nature and causes of
gravitational phenomena.

Finally, as we have noted, the restriction that the ensemble should be statistically stationary (imposed initially
for simplicity) was equivalent to making the analysis non-relativistic. The relativistic counterpart of the foregoing
analysis arises from a consideration of a non-stationary universe, and gives rise to a model universe in which the
ﬂat spacetime of special relativity is irreducible associated with a relativistically invariant material vacuum of fractal
dimension.

C Outline analysis of the potential function

It is quite plain from (22) that, for any m1
= 0, then the model universe has a preferred centre and that the
parameter m1 (which has dimensions of mass) plays a role in the potential V which is analogous to the source mass
in a Newtonian spherical potential - that is, the parameter m1 can be identiﬁed as the mass of the potential source in
= 1
the model universe. However, setting m1 = 0 is not suﬃcient to guarantee a constant potential ﬁeld since any d0
also provides the model universe with a preferred centre. The role of d0 is most simply discussed in the limiting case
of m1 = 0: in this case, the second equation of (22) becomes

0 so that a singularity exists. Conversely, remembering that v2

0 > 0 (cf
1212.3) then,
If d0 < 1 then
§
if d0 > 1, equation (28) restricts real events to the exterior of the sphere deﬁned by r2 = (d0
1)h2/v2
0. In this case,
the singularity is avoided and the central ‘massless particle’ is given the physical property of ‘ﬁnite extension’. In
the more realistic case for which m1 > 0, reference to (22) shows that the r = 0 singularity is completely avoided
whenever h2 > m1v2
0g0 since then a ‘ﬁnite extension’ property for the central massive particle always exists.
Conversely, a singularity will necessarily exist whenever h2

0g0.

In other words, the model universe has a preferred centre when either m1 > 0, in which case the source of the
potential is a massive central particle having various properties depending on the value of d0, or when m1 = 0 and
d1

= 0.

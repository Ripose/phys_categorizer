1 INTRODUCTION

The orret expressions for the eletromagneti energy and momentum and their transformation

properties are topis of repeated disussions in this journal and elsewhere. Two approahes to these

problems an be distinguished. The main points of both approahes are fairly well exposed in the

Rohrlih- Boyer disussion [1, 2℄ and in the subsequent Comment [3℄.

In 1966. Rohrlih [4℄ introdued the notions of the true and apparent transformations of physial

quantities. The transformations of the four-dimensional (4D) spaetime tensors referring to the

same quantity onsidered in di(cid:27)erent inertial frames of referene (IFRs) are the true transformations

(TT). They are in full agreement with the speial relativity as the theory of 4D spaetime with

pseudo-Eulidean geometry. An example of the TT are the Lorentz transformations (LT) of 4D

tensor quantities. On the ontrary the transformations whih do not refer to the same physial

quantity, e.g., the transformations whih refer to the same measurement in di(cid:27)erent IFRs, are the

apparent transformations (AT). Rohrlih [4℄ and Gamba [5℄ disussed di(cid:27)erent examples of the TT

and the AT and expliitly showed that the Lorentz ontration of length (volume) belongs to the

lass of - the AT.

The fundamental di(cid:27)erene between the AT and the TT of physial quantities is previously

mainly overlooked. The importane of that di(cid:27)erene is emphasized in this paper and it is shown

here that the usual transformations of the eletri E and the magneti B (cid:28)elds as the three-vetors
(3-vetors) also belong to the lass of - the AT. The 4-vetors Eα
are introdued instead of E
and B and the ovariant Maxwell equations are formulated in terms of Eα
ovariant formulation with Eα
and Bα
the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld tensor F αβ

and Bα

and Bα

is equivalent to the usual ovariant eletrodynamis with

. This alternative

, (see also [6℄).

It has to be pointed out that our ovariant approah with Eα

and Bα

does not make use

, and thus dispenses with the need for gauge

of the intermediate eletromagneti 4-potential Aµ

onditions.

The existene of the di(cid:27)erene between the AT and the TT auses that one an speak about

two forms of relativity: the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) and the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) The former is the onventional

speial relativity based on Einstein's relativity of simultaneity and on the synhronous de(cid:28)nition

of length, i.e., on the AT of length and time, and, as shown here, on the AT of the eletri and

magneti 3-vetors E and B. The (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) or, equivalently, the ovariant formulation of

1

relativity, is based on the TT of physial quantities as 4D spaetime tensors, i.e., on the ovariant

de(cid:28)nition of length, and the ovariant eletrodynamis with F αβ
with 4-vetors Eα

and Bα

.

or, equivalently, as shown here,

The alternative ovariant approah is used to disuss di(cid:27)erent de(cid:28)nitions of the eletromagneti

momentum and energy, and also to disuss the related (cid:17)4/3(cid:17) problem in the eletromagneti mass

of the eletron. First in Se. 2 the AT and the TT of length (volume) and of the eletri and

magneti (cid:28)elds are onsidered. It is also shown that, ontrary to von Laue's theorem, an integral

of a symmetri tensor of seond rank over the hyperplane t = const. does not form a true 4-vetor,
sine the transformation of that integral from an IFR S to another IFR S′

is - an AT. These

results are used in all other Setions. In Se. 3 it is proved that the onventional de(cid:28)nitions of the

eletromagneti energy and momentum are not ovariant de(cid:28)nitions, sine they are synhronous

de(cid:28)nitions, whih use the AT of volume elements, i.e., the Lorentz ontration, and the AT for E
and B. Rohrlih's approah is disussed in Se. 4. It is shown that neither Rohrlih's relations

for the eletromagneti energy and momentum de(cid:28)ne the true 4-vetor, sine the eletromagneti

(cid:28)eld tensor F αβ
replae E and B with Eα
ontaining E and B. Furthermore, the 4/3 problem in the eletromagneti mass is disussed in this

is expressed in terms of E and B and the AT for E and B are used. In Se. 5 we

and Bα

and ompare the obtained expressions with Rohrlih's relations

Setion. In Se. 6 some reent treatments of the eletromagneti energy and momentum and of

the 4/3 problem are disussed and it is shown that in all of them either the AT of volume elements,

or the AT of E and B, or both of them, are used. This means that none of these treatments do

onform with the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17)

2 TRUE AND APPARENT TRANSFORMATIONS

Aording to the (cid:17)modern(cid:17) point of view the speial relativity is the theory of 4D spaetime with

pseudo-Eulidean geometry. Quantities of physial interest, both loal and nonloal, are repre-

sented in the speial relativity by spaetime tensors, i.e., as ovariant quantities. The laws of

physis are written in the speial relativity in a manifestly ovariant way as tensorial equations.

The geometry of the spaetime is de(cid:28)ned by the invariant in(cid:28)nitesimal spaetime distane ds of
two neighboring points, ds2 = gµνdxµdxν
(gµν is the metri tensor; Greek indies run from 0 to 3,
latin indies run from 1 to 3, and repeated indies imply summation). The laws of physis writ-

ten as tensorial equations with 4D spaetime tensors in an IFR wil l have the same form in some

other IFR, i.e., in new oordinates, if new and old oordinates are onneted by those oordinate

transformations that leave the interval ds, and thus the pseudo-Eulidean geometry of the spae-

time, unhanged. This means that in the referene frames that are onneted by suh oordinate

transformations all physial phenomena will proeed in the same way, (taking into aount the

orresponding initial and boundary onditions), and thus there is no physial di(cid:27)erene between

them, (the priniple of relativity). The transformations that leave ds unhanged also transform
a physial quantity represented by 4D spaetime tensor from an IFR S to another IFR S′
same quantity is onsidered in S and S′

. Suh transformations are the TT and an example of

; the

them are, as already said, the LT between IFRs. The meaning of the same quantity Rohrlih [4℄

expresses in the following way: (cid:17)A quantity is therefore physially meaningful (in the sense that

it is of the same nature to all observers) if it has tensorial properties under Lorentz transforma-

tions.(cid:17) Similarly Gamba [5℄, when disussing the sameness of a physial quantity (for example, the

quantity Aµ(xλ, Xλ), whih is a funtion of two points xλ and Xλ ) for di(cid:27)erent IFRs S and S′
delares: (cid:17)The quantity Aµ(xλ, Xλ) for S is the same as the quantity A′

λ, X ′

λ) for S′

µ(x′

when all

,

the primed quantities are obtained from the orresponding unprimed quantities through Lorentz

transformations (tensor alulus).(cid:17)

It has to be noted that, in priniple, one an hoose any referene frame in whih some physial

quantity is ovariantly de(cid:28)ned, and then the same quantity is onsidered in all other referene

frames, transforming all parts of that quantity by the TT. The whole physis will not depend on

the hosen frame. However, the most onvenient hoie for systems with rest mass is the rest frame,

sine in that frame one retains the similarity with the prerelativisti physis.

2.1 True and Apparent Transformations of Length (Volume)

The de(cid:28)nition of length (volume) whih is in aordane with all the above onsideration is - the

ovariant de(cid:28)nition of length (see, e.g., Ref. 7 and referenes therein, or for the volume [4, 5℄).

The invariant spaetime length (the Lorentz salar) is formed as l = (lµlµ)1/2
distane 4-vetor between two spatial points A and B on the (moving) ob jet, lµ = xµ
xµ
A,B are the position 4-vetors in some IFR S . (We use Cartesian spae oordinates xi
t(x0 ≡ ct). Without loss of generality we work in an IFR with the Minkowski metri tensor
gµν =diag(−1, 1, 1, 1).) The observers in all other IFRs will look at the same events but assoiating

where lµ is the
B − xµ
A,

and time

with them di(cid:27)erent oordinates; it is the essene of the ovariant desription. The LT of the

position 4-vetors, of the distane 4-vetor, and of the invariant spaetime length are all the TT.

In ontrast to the ovariant de(cid:28)nition of length and the TT of the spaetime tensors the syn-

hronous de(cid:28)nition of length, introdued by Einstein [8℄, de(cid:28)nes length as the spatial distane

between two points on the (moving) objet measured by simultaneity in the rest frame of the ob-

server. Let l0 be the rest length, or the three-dimensional volume dV0 , measured by simultaneity
in S0 , the rest frame of the ob jet, at some t0 = a. Then the length l′
termined simultaneously in some IFR S′
(dV ′ = dV00(1 − β2)1/2
that t0 = a in S0 and t′ = b in S′

, at some t′ = b, is Lorentz ontrated, l′ = l0(1 − β2)1/2

), (β = V /c, V is the relative veloity of S0 and S′

(the 3D volume dV ′

are not related by the LT or any other oordinate transformation.

. It has to be emphasized

) de-

,

The time omponent is not transformed in the Lorentz ontration. This means that the observers

in S0 and S′
mined in the rest frame of the observer refer to the same measurement in S0 and S′

do not look at the same events. Hene the quantities l0 and l′

synhronously deter-

and not to

the same 4D tensor quantity. Therefore the Lorentz ontration as the transformation onneting

them is - the AT.

2.2 Von Laue's theorem

The existene of the fundamental di(cid:27)erene between the TT and the AT enables us to examine

an important theorem (it is sometimes alled (cid:17)von Laue's theorem(cid:17)), whih is widely used in

the theory of relativity and in the quantum theory of (cid:28)elds. This theorem roughly states: The

neessary and su(cid:30)ient ondition for the hyperplane integral of a symmetri tensor of seond rank

then it an be written as

Σ T µν(x)d3σν (x)) to be independent of the orientation of that hyperplane (Σ) is that T be
T (
divergene-free, ∂νT µν = 0, (loal onservation law); and if that integral is orientation-independent,
R
t=a T µ0(r, t)d3x =
t=b T µ0(r, t)d3x), and 2) it is a 4-vetor, (the proof of that theorem an be found in, e.g., Ref .9,
R
4-vetor harater. In the proof of 2) the integrals are taken over the hypersurfaes t = a in S and
t′ = b in S′

t=a T µ0(r, t)d3x and it is 1) independent of time, (
R

Se. 5.8, and Ref. 10). We are not interesting in the time independene of that integral but in its

R

. Aording to the previous disussion about the sameness of a physial quantity for

di(cid:27)erent IFRs, and the related onsideration about the TT and the AT, we onlude: The integral

refer to the same quantity onsidered from di(cid:27)erent IFRs, (whih are onneted by the LT), sine

t=a T µ0(r, t)d3x annot be a true 4-vetor from the (cid:17)TT viewpoint.(cid:17) Namely, this integral does not
R
the hyperplanes taken at t = a in S and t′ = b in S′
primed elements of volume d3x′
LT from S , than they are simply the elements of volume of an arbitrary hosen hypersurfae t′ = b
in S′
that ompound physial quantity are transformed by the LT from S to S′

. The transformation onneting the integrals in S and S′

in the integral in S′

µ0(r′, t′)d3x′

t′=b T

R

are not related in any way. Thus, e.g., the

is - an AT, sine not al l parts of

) are not obtained by the

. The situation with the

′

(

transformation of that integral is quite similar to the already disussed Lorentz ontration as an

AT. We see that, ontrary to von Laue's theorem, the vanishing of the divergene of T does not

assure that the mentioned integral is a true 4-vetor. The onsiderations and the proofs given in

the previous literature negleted that the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) demands the same physial quantity to

be onsidered from di(cid:27)erent IFRs, i.e., that all parts of that quantity have to be transformed by

the LT from S to S′

.

2.3 The Proof that the Transformations of

and

are - the AT

E

B

As a next example we onsider the transformations of E and B.
the ovariant formulation of the eletrodynamis with F αβ
and the usual formulation with E and
B are equivalent, and therefore that the usual transformations of E and B are atually the TT.

It is generally believed that

However we show that these transformations also belong to the lass of - the AT, (see also[6℄). In

the modern derivation of the transformation relations for E and B, (see, e.g., Ref. 11 Se. 11.10,
Ref. 9 Se. 3.3.), one identi(cid:28)es, in some IFR S , the omponents of the 3-vetors Ei and Bi with
the omponents of F αβ

as Ei = F 0i, and Bi = (1/c)∗F 0i

in order to get in that IFR the usual

Maxwell equations,

∇E(r, t) = ρ(r, t)/ε0, ∇ × E(r, t) = −∂B(r, t)/∂t,
∇B(r, t) = 0, ∇ × B(r, t) = µ0j(r, t) + µ0ε0∂E(r, t)/∂t,

Maxwell equations are - the TT. The ovariant Maxwell equations do not hange their form on the

in order to obtain the usual Maxwell equations (in the three-vetor form) from the transformed

ovariant Maxwell equations. This proedure then gives the onnetion between the 3-vetors E′

of the 3-veloity V are written with lowered (generi) subsripts, sine they are not the spatial
omponents of the 4-vetors. This refers to the third-rank antisymmetri ε tensor too. The super-

even for IFRs. The de(cid:28)nition (2)an be

in, e.g., Ref. 13, where the ovariant eletrodynamis

opposite; Eα

viewpoint.(cid:17)

and Bα

The introdution of Eα

enables us to better explain why the transformations of E
and B, (1), are the AT. Namely, in the mentioned modern derivation of (1) two di(cid:27)erent families
of observers who measure the eletri (cid:28)eld are onsidered, one at rest in the IFR S , for whih
vα = (c, 0), and another one at rest in the IFR S', for whih again v′α = (c, 0), and these
observers in S and S′
are not related in any way. Suh assumptions for vα
does not onsider the same physial quantity in S and S′
Ξ′α
has nothing in ommon with the eletri (cid:28)eld Eα

is not transformed) are onsidered in S and S′

, respetively. The quantity Ξ′α

, but that two di(cid:27)erent quantities Eα

(in whih vα

and v′α

. This means that the transformations (1) are

mean that one

and

the AT; they refer to the same measurement in two IFRs and not to the same physial quantity as

required by the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) The TT referring to the same physial quantity are the LT of Eα
and Bα

.

It has to be mentioned here that although Rohrlih, [4, 1℄ and Gamba [5℄ orretly insist on

ovariant de(cid:28)nitions of various physial quantities, they also did not notie that equations (1) are

the AT that do not refer to the same physial quantity in two IFRs.

Using Eα

vα

will be expressed by means of Eα

, and vα

and Bα

in these works). The inverse relations are

, (ompare with Refs.

, and

. For that one needs the inverse relations to the

F αβ = (1/c)δαβ

where δαβ
satisfy the onditions vαEα = vβBβ = 0, as
and Bα
an be heked from (2) and (3). Substituting (3) into the ovariant Maxwell equations with F αβ
we obtain the ovariant Maxwell equations with Eα

and

to the ovariant formu-

, while the relations (2) do the reverse transformations, (see also [6℄).

The relations (3) transform the ovariant formulation with F αβ
lation with Eα

and Bα

If one takes that in an IFR S the observers who measure Eα

then E0 = B0 = 0, and one an derive from the ovariant Maxwell equations with Eα
the Maxwell equations whih ontain only the spae parts Ei

equations obtained in suh a way are of the same form as the usual Maxwell equations with E
and B. From the above onsideration one onludes that all the results obtained in a given IFR
S from the usual Maxwell equations with E and B remain valid in the ovariant formulation with
the 4-vetors Eα

but only for the observers who measure the (cid:28)elds Eα

and Bα

and Bα

, e.g., from

and are

are at rest, i.e., vα = (c, 0),

at rest in the onsidered IFR. Then for suh observers the omponents of E and B, whih are not

well de(cid:28)ned quantities in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) an be simply replaed by the spae omponents of

, moving with V α

(determined by the AT (1)) from the transformed ovariant Maxwell equations with E′α

one annot obtain the usual Maxwell equations with the 3-vetors

3 CONVENTIONAL DEFINITIONS OF THE ELECTRO-

MAGNETIC MOMENTUM AND ENERGY

In this setion we onsider the onventional synhronous de(cid:28)nitions of the eletromagneti momen-

tum and energy, (see, e.g., Refs. 1-3, Refs. 15,16). The total 4-momentum of a harged system

an be written as

P µ

to hoose Σ as the plain t = a in S and t′ = b in S′
T µν
shown in the preeding setion, ontrary to the assertions in [2, 3, 15, 16], (whih are based on von
Laue's theorem), the integral over the hyperplane t = const., i.e., P µ

. Both stress-energy tensors in (4),Θµν

tot. (4), is not a true 4-vetor,

, i.e., at a single time in the observer's frame. But, as

and

sine the transformation of that integral is - an AT.

3.1 The Eletromagneti Component

Using suh synhronous de(cid:28)nitions, i.e., the hoie t = const. for the hypersurfae Σ in the ob-
server's frame, and onsidering only the eletromagneti omponent with T µν
of E and B, one (cid:28)nds the onventional form for P µ

of the (cid:28)eld in an IFR S

expressed in terms

P µ

f = (1/c)

T µ0(r, t)d3x

Zt=a

and the traditional expressions for the (cid:28)eld energy and momentum:

cP 0

f = Uf = (ε0/2)

E2(r, t) + c2B2(r, t)

u(r, t)d3x,

E(r, t) × B(r, t)d3x =

(cid:3)
g(r, t)d3x.

Zt=a

Zt=a

(Note that P µ

f (5-6) is not a legitimate 4-vetor and the notation with the supersripts is not

appropriate, but here we retain suh notation due to historial reasons.) For the determination

f and P ′0

of P ′
hypersurfaes t = const., whih are the AT, and 2) the AT (1) of E and B. This means that

in S′

one needs to perform: 1) the transformations of the integrals, i.e., of the

f

the onventional synhronous de(cid:28)nitions of the eletromagneti energy and momentum are not in

aordane with the (cid:17)TT relativity;(cid:17) the energy- momentum (5-6) as a synhronously determined

nonloal physial quantity in an IFR has nothing to do with the orresponding quantity relevant

to observers in another IFR.

3.2 The Poinaré Stresses and the Noneletromagneti Component

In addition, it has to be mentioned that the origin and nature of the Poinaré stresses, whih

are inluded in Θµν

omponent, are unknown, and, in fat, Poinaré stresses are not measurable

physial quantities. Suh a theory with Poinaré's stresses is like the theories whih tried in the

6

synhronous formulation of nonloal physial quantities to resolve the problem of equilibrium in

the speial relativity, partiularly the right-angled lever problem, by introduing the (cid:28)tive energy

urrent, von Laue's energy urrent [18℄; (many others repeated Laue's explanation, see, e.g., Ref.

19). But, as Arano(cid:27) [20] stated in his severe ritiism of von Laue's explanation: (cid:17)The energy

urrent idea of von Laue has to go the way of phlogiston, and the ether. It is interesting how man

has to invent very (cid:28)ne (cid:29)uids whih arry energy but whih are otherwise unobservable.(cid:17) Exatly

the same statement is appropriate for the Poinaré stresses.

It is interesting to disuss in more detail the explanations given for the noneletromagneti

omponent Θµν

in the theories [2, 3, 15, 16]. Boyer [2] onsiders a spherial shell of harge (as

a model of the lassial eletron) in di(cid:27)erent IFRs. He onludes that, in an improper IFR,

there is a net transfer of energy and momentum from the mehanial stabilizing fores to the

eletromagneti (cid:28)eld as a onsequene of the relativity of simultaneity, i.e., as a result of the

nonsimultaneity of the (cid:17)lamping(cid:17) of the fores of onstraint on the moving harged shell. On the

other hand, aording to [2], there is no suh transfer in the rest frame sine there the fores of

onstraint were applied simultaneously. However, we note that the relativity of simultaneity is not

an intrinsi feature of relativity, but it is a oordinate dependent e(cid:27)et, i.e., it depends on the

kind of synhronization proedure adopted, and thus on the adopted oordinatization proedure

of Minkowski spaetime. This means that the above mentioned transfer of energy and momentum

[2], will depend on the adopted synhronization proedure and partiularly for the synhronization

with absolute simultaneity, (see, e.g., Ref. 21), the net transfer would need to disappear. Thus the

hanges in energy and momentum of the moving harged shell whih own their existene to the

relativity of simultaneity are, in fat, unphysial. Therefore, the assertions given in [2] about the

validity and the relativisti orretness of the traditional de(cid:28)nitions (5-6) in every IFR, taken at a

single time in that frame, are unfounded.

Boyer used the relativity of simultaneity to obtain the additional ontributions to the (cid:17)pure

eletromagneti(cid:17) energy and momentum (5-6) for a moving harged system, i.e., during a trans-

formation from the rest frame to another IFR. Instead of that the energy inrement is explained

in [15] as arising from the fores of onstraint due to work done by these fores during the Lorentz

ontration of a moving harged system. The additional ontribution to the eletromagneti mo-

mentum of a moving harged system is assoiated in [15] with the energy (cid:29)ow (as von Laue's

energy urrent) due to fores of onstraint. But, as shown in Se. 2, the Lorentz ontration is an

AT. This fat, together with the use of the synhronous de(cid:28)nitions (5-6), auses that neither the

treatment in [15] do onform with the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17)

In [16] a parallel plates apaitor and a uniformly harged spherial shell were onsidered. In

a similar way as in [2] and [15], it is attempted in [16] to obtain T µν

tot. , whih is divergeneless. A

speial gaseous substane (a speial kind of (cid:17)moleules(cid:17) that are onsidered as moving partiles

or as ontinuous gaseous substane) is introdued in order to provide the additional energy and

momentum needed to balane the eletromagneti energy and momentum. We remark that this

gaseous substane is the same kind of substane as that one involved in von Laue's energy urrent,

i.e., as Arano(cid:27) [20] states: (cid:17)....very (cid:28)ne (cid:29)uids whih arry energy but whih are otherwise unobserv-
able.(cid:17) Really it is assumed in [16] that the mentioned (cid:17)moleules(cid:17) arry the energy and momentum

but they do not interat with one another and: (cid:17) do not hange the dieletri properties of the

medium between the plates whih is the same as that of the vauum.(cid:17)

We see that in the onventional de(cid:28)nitions (4), (5-6) the treatment of the eletromagneti

omponent inludes the AT of the hyperplane t = const. and the AT of E and B, while the

treatment of the noneletromagneti omponent introdues and uses unphysial quantities.

4 ROHRLICH'S DEFINITIONS OF THE ELECTROMAG-

NETIC MOMENTUM 4-VECTOR

Next, we onsider Rohrlih's de(cid:28)nition of the eletromagneti momentum 4-vetor and the appro-

priate transformations of the eletromagneti energy and momentum. Instead of the traditional,

synhronous, de(cid:28)nitions (5-6) in the observer's frame Rohrlih [22, 23, 1] de(cid:28)nes the energy and

momentum of the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld in a relativisti ovariant way. The general manifestly

ovariant de(cid:28)nition of the eletromagneti 4-momentum in any IFR is given by (4) without the

7

noneletromagneti part, i.e., as

P µ

f = (1/c)

T µν(x)d3σν (x),

ZΣ

with the same meaning of symbols as in (4). The energy momentum tensor T µν
of F µν

as

is given in terms

T µν = ε0

F µαF ν

α + (1/4)gµνFαβ F αβ.

Rohrlih [1, 22, 23] de(cid:28)ned the eletromagneti energy-momentum for a system in uniform motion

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

as the Lorentz boosted rest frame, and the hyperplane of integration is spei(cid:28)ed to be the plane in

whih the system is at rest. In suh a way it is ahieved that P µ
f is a 4-vetor even though there are
soures present. In the IFR S(0) in whih the system is at rest Rohrlih hooses the hypersurfae
Σ in (7) to be the plane Σ(0) = t(0) = const.. The same Σ is onsidered from al l other IFRs as
required by the ovariant approah, i.e., in some IFR S obtained by the Lorentz transformation L
from S(0) , Σ in (7) is LΣ(0) . d3σν in an IFR S an be written as d3σν = nνd3σ , where nν
a timelike vetor normal to the hyperplane Σ, nν = Γ(1, β), (β = V/c, V is the 3-veloity of the
frame S relative to S(0) ). In S(0) nµ
(0) = (1, 0). d3σ is an invariant and it is = dV(0) , where dV(0)
is the in(cid:28)nitesimal element of the 3D spatial volume V(0) , i.e., of the 3D hyperplane t(0) = const.,
in the rest frame S(0) of the system. We see that in Rohrlih's approah one always integrates

being

over the hyperplane whih is the transformed three spae of the rest frame. Obviously, aording

to the onstrution, i.e., sine always the same physial quantity is onsidered from di(cid:27)erent IFRs

and only the TT are used, it is found that the quantity P µ

f (7) is a legitimate 4-vetor. However,

when Rohrlih expliitly alulates (7) for spei(cid:28) physial system he also writes, as all others, the

eletromagneti energy and momentum densities in terms of the 3-vetors E and B and uses the

AT (1).

In order to remove the last element from the theory that is not in aordane with the (cid:17)TT

5.1 P µ

f in S(0) and S

Let us now use the above manifestly ovariant expression for P µ
spei(cid:28) ases onsidered in [1] and [2]. First we write T µν
harged sphere, i.e., when uα

(the 4-veloity

In order to (cid:28)nd the 4-momentum P µ
(7), in another IFR S moving with the 4-veloity
V α = (Γc, ΓV, 0, 0) relative to S(0) one an either transform P µ
f (0) as a 4-vetor from S(0) to S ,
or to transform all quantities on the right-hand side of (10) from S(0) to S . The same result is

obtained and it is

Note that the same family of observers who measures Eα
(0) in S(0) is onsidered in all
other IFRs. Wee see that, when referred to the invariant 3D integration volume dV(0) , the energy
density uE in the IFR S moving with V α = (Γc, ΓV, 0, 0) relative to S(0) is ΓuE(0) , ontrary to the
results in [1, 22, 23].

5.2 The ((cid:17)4/3(cid:17)) Fator

We an use these results to disuss the famous (cid:17)4/3(cid:17) fator appearing in the problem of the

eletromagneti mass of the lassial eletron, (see, e.g., Refs. 1-3). Let us suppose that in the

rest system S(0) the whole mass m of the eletron (onsidered as a sphere of radius R with a

uniform surfae harge density) is due to eletrostati energy of the (cid:28)eld. Using the traditional,

synhronous, de(cid:28)nitions (5-6), one (cid:28)nds that in S(0) cP 0
f (0) = mc2 = Uf (0) , and Pf (0) = 0. In an
f = Γm(1 + u2/3),
IFR S in whih the partile moves with the veloity u one obtains from (5-6) P 0
and Pf = (4/3)Γmu, (see eqations (11) and (12) in Rohrlih's ritiism [1] of the work [2]). We see
that the spurious 4/3 fator appears in Pf . Of ourse, as already said, the quantities P 0
f and Pf
do not form a 4-vetor. Beause of that f µ
coh , the fore density that provides the Poinaré stresses,
is introdued into the theory. Then P 0
to give that the sum of two false 4-vetors P µ

coh and Pcoh are alulated by means of f µ

coh in suh a way

coh is a hyperplane integral independent of the

f and P µ

orientation of that hyperplane. Applying von Laue's theorem it is onluded by the proponents of

the synhronous de(cid:28)nitions that suh sum is a legitimate 4-vetor, (see, e.g., Ref. 1 Eqs. (14) and

(15)). However, despite the fat that the sum P µ
coh an be written in the form of a 4-vetor,
i.e., as mvµ
, (see equation (15) in [1]), this quantity is not a true 4-vetor. As we have already
shown this sum does not refer to the same quantity onsidered in di(cid:27)erent IFRs; the plains t(0) = a
in S(0) and t = b in S are not related by the LT than by the AT, and the relations (1) onneting
E and B in S and E(0) and B(0) in S(0) are not the LT of the same quantities from S(0) to S , than

f + P µ

they are also the AT.

In ontrast to the synhronous de(cid:28)nitions onsidered in [2, 3, 15, 16], Rohrlih's expressions for

P 0
f and P k

f in S , derived in the Appendix in [1], give that P µ

f alone an be written as mvµ

, and

aordingly it is also onluded in [1], by the use of von Laue's theorem, that P µ
In Rohrlih's approah there is no spurious 4/3 fator in P µ
f , and, in ontrast to Boyer's approah,
Rohrlih's Σ in S is orretly determined as LΣ(0) . But, as already said, neither Rohrlih's P µ
f
is a legitimate 4-vetor, sine he uses the AT of E and B. The use of E and B and the AT (1)

>From (11,12) and (13) we see that in the ovariant approah presented here the spurious

fator 4/3 does not appear and that (cid:17)pure eletromagneti(cid:17) P µ

f is a legitimate 4-vetor; it refers to

the same quantity in all IFRs sine all parts of it are Lorentz transformed when going from IFR

S(0) to some IFR S .

The expressions for P µ

and P k
f with E and B [1], an be obtained in the following way. Let the IFR S be the frame in
whih the partile moves with the 4-veloity uα = (γuc, γuu, 0, 0), and therefore the unit 4-vetor
nµ
is nµ = (γu, γuβu, 0, 0). The 4-momentum is given by (7). Using these relations we write the
omponents of P µ

Further, let the observers who measure the (cid:28)elds Eα

6 SOME RECENT TREATMENTS OF THE ELECTRO-

MAGNETIC MOMENTUM AND ENERGY

In this setion we onsider some reent treatments of the eletromagneti energy and momentum.

10

6.1 Romer's Question and Answers

Reently Romer [24] revived the question of the orret expressions for the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld

momentum and energy in the ase of (cid:17)bound(cid:17) (cid:28)elds, (cid:28)elds that are tied to their soures. He, and

many others (see referenes in [24]), uses the traditional synhronous de(cid:28)nitions (5-6). As we have
already shown the relations (5-6) ontain the AT of the hyperplane t = const. and the AT of E
and B. Di(cid:27)erent answers to this question have been given in [25]. Neither the answers [25] to the
question in [24] are in a omplete agreement with the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) First, they also work with
E and B and their AT (1), and base their onlusions on von Laue's theorem.

6.2 Shwinger's Consideration of the (cid:17)4/3(cid:17) Problem

We have to mention an interesting onsideration of the eletromagneti energy and momentum

and the eletromagneti mass given in [26] by Shwinger. He also uses the synhronous de(cid:28)nition
of P µ
f (5). In di(cid:27)erene to the works [2, 3, 15, 16] he does not deal with Poinaré's stresses, but
hanges the de(cid:28)nition of the eletromagneti energy-momentum tensor T µν
said T µν

(8) is not divergene-free and therefore the hyperplane integral of T µν

(7), is dependent of

(8). As it is already

the orientation of the hyperplane. Shwinger onstrues, but only for a lass of (cid:28)elds and urrents,

assoiated with uniform motion, a new, onserved, divergeneless, energy-momentum tensor T µν
Sch.
of the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld. Sine ∂ν T µν
Sch. = 0 it is ahieved in [26] that the hyperplane integral
(7), (with T µν
Sch. replaing T µν

(8)), is independent of the orientation of that hyperplane, and this

is onsidered by Shwinger too as a neessary and su(cid:30)ient ondition that the integral (7) is a

true 4-vetor, i.e., he also aepts von Laue's theorem as that it is a orret one from the (cid:17)TT

f (5). Also it has to be noted that the tensor T µν

viewpoint.(cid:17) Then hoosing that Σ in (7) is the plane t = a in some IFR S the integral (7) beomes
the synhronous de(cid:28)nition of P µ
and for the same (cid:28)eld-urrent distribution one an have di(cid:27)erent T µν
Sch. , e.g., the tensor (1) equation
(42) and the tensor (2) equation (44) in [26]. Using di(cid:27)erent T µν
Sch. ((1) and (2) in [26]) two di(cid:27)erent
(cid:17)ovariant(cid:17) versions of the onept of eletromagneti mass were obtained in [26]. We note that
the same remarks as for the usual synhronous de(cid:28)nitions hold also here; t(0) = const. in S(0) and
t = a in S are not related by the LT than by the AT. Further, the energy and momentum in [26]
are ultimately expressed in terms of E and B, (see equations (43), (45) and (46) in [26]). Thus,
ontrary to the assertions in [26], we onlude that even though the energy and momentum de(cid:28)ned
by (5) (with T µ0
) transform like a 4-vetor (see equations (62-63) in [26]), these
equations, whih are derived from P µ

Sch. instead of T µ0

f (5), do not de(cid:28)ne a true 4-vetor, i.e., they do not ovariantly

Sch. is not unique,

de(cid:28)ne the energy and momentum of the (cid:17)bound(cid:17) eletromagneti (cid:28)eld. The AT are used in the

derivation in [26], whene one onludes that neither the equations (62) based on rest mass m(2)
nor the relations (63) based on rest mass m(1)

do refer to the same physial quantity onsidered

from di(cid:27)erent IFRs.

6.3 Some Other Treatments

Reently the eletromagneti mass derived from the self-fore and the 4/3 fator were disussed in

[27]. These works will not be onsidered here, but we only mention that, ultimately, they use the
synhronous de(cid:28)nitions and the 3-vetors E and B.

In the reent work [14] the ovariant Ma jorana formulation of eletrodynamis is onstruted.

There, the ovariant expression (with the 4-vetors Eα
to our Eq. (9). But, as we have said, Esposito [14] onsiders the (cid:28)elds Eα
(cid:28)elds, while the 3-vetor (cid:28)elds E and B are onsidered as physial (cid:28)elds. The situation is just the

) for T µν

and Bα

and Bα

is obtained, and it is equal

as (cid:17)auxiliary(cid:17)

opposite in our alternative ovariant approah.

The preeding disussion indiates that the orret de(cid:28)nitions from the (cid:17)TT viewpoint(cid:17) of the

eletromagneti 4-momentum have to ontain only ovariantly de(cid:28)ned quantities, inluding the

4-vetors Eα

and Bα

instead of the usual 3-vetors E and B, and the TT of 4D tensor quantities

instead of the AT. Suh relations are the expressions (7-15) in this paper.

7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The fundamental di(cid:27)erene between the apparent and true transformations of physial quantities,

whih is previously mainly overlooked, enabled us to reveal that the usual formulation of ele-

trodynamis with the 3-vetors E and B is not in agreement with the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) Di(cid:27)erent

de(cid:28)nitions of the eletromagneti energy and momentum are shown to be invalid from the (cid:17)TT

viewpoint(cid:17) sine they ontain either the AT of volume, or the AT of E and B, or both of them. We
have onstruted a ovariant formulation of eletrodynamis with the 4-vetors Eα
as valid as the usual ovariant approah with F αβ
energy-momentum density tensor T µν

Abstract

It is shown that the Dirac theory implies complex space-time and complex

space-time can lead to the Dirac equation.

It is suggested that fermions

are grouped into doublets, those doublets are then divided into color singlets

(leptons) and color triplets (quarks), then they are further divided into gener-

ation singlets and generation triplets.

If the exclusion principle for fermions

works in the internal space, then the non-observation of free quarks can be

explained. However, it is suggested that a possible new free quark may exist

with a color triplet and generation singlet state which is antisymmetric in the

internal space.

Key words: Complex space-time, classiﬁcation of elementary particles,

explanation for non-existing free quarks, possible existence of new free quarks.

I. INTRODUCTION

In his great discovery of the Dirac equation [1,2], Dirac introduced γµ into the ory and

describes naturally internal spin and antiparticles. However, there are many more internal

variables such as isospin, hypercharge, color, ... etc. To have a theory that contains all of

these variables, new degrees of freedom for the internal motion may be needed. The purpose

of this article is to show that Dirac theory implies the existence of a complex space-time, that

complex space-time can account for the fact that a free particle is a free wave as well, and

also can reproduce the Dirac equation. It is suggested that all fermions can be classiﬁed into

fermion doublets, color singlets and triplets, and generation singlets and triplets. Finally, if

the principle of anti-symmetrization for fermion state, can be generalized to be valid in the

internal space, then the non-observation of a free quark is a result of the present treatment.

However, it is also suggested that there is a possibility that a new free quark may exist with

an internally anti-symmetric state function.

II. DIRAC THEORY AND COMPLEX SPACE-TIME

Consider the Dirac Hamiltonian of a free election

H = −→α ·

−→
P + βm,

(c = ¯h = 1).

The x1-component of the velocity and the x1-component of coordinate are given as(see

Chapter XI of ref.[2])

˙x1 = α1 = P1H −1 +

iα0

1 exp(−2iHt)H −1 ≡ ˙x1(classical) + ˙η1,

x1 = p1H −1t + a1 −

with x1 (classical) = a1 + p1H −1t,

˙x1(classical) = p1H −1. We can consider the system of

a particle with (xµ, pµ; µ = 1, · · · 4) in the physical space coupled to its internal variables

(αi, β; i = 1, 2, 3) in the internal space. Due to the coupling, the generalized normal coordi-

nates become mixtures of both parts (the physical part and the internal part), and similarly

for the velocity components. The motion of the ηi is known as Zitterbewegung which has

never been observed experimentally, so it cannot exist in our physical space, and can only

stay in the internal space. In fact, ηi is related to the αi and β. Since the total angular

momentum is conserved

−→η is responsible for the conservation of total angular momentum (orbital plus spin). From
−→
P is zero). This is because −→α is responsible

equation (2), ˙η1 is a part of α1( ˙ηi = αi when

for the Lorentz covariant 4-currents which are physically very important in describing inter-
actions between quantum systems. Therefore −→η is physically important. A good physical

quantity must be Lorentz covariant, so there must exist an η4 so as to make ηµ Lorentz co-

variant. Consider the case when Pi = 0, and ηi = (−i/2m)βαi, so ηµ = (−i/2m)γµ. ηµ is a

component of a dynamical quantity in the internal space implying that there are 4 axes, yµ

in that space. The ηµ is complex. In our physical space-time, xi is real and x4 is imaginary.

There is no a priori reason why the yi or y4 should be real or imaginary when the universe

was created. However, nature has preference for simplicity and uniﬁcation. Therefore, the

physical space-time and the internal space should be created together as a whole by taking

all possible combinations of xi and x4 with equal probability to make a greater universe as

GU = P1(xR

i , xR

4 ) + P2(xR

i , xI

4) + P3(xI

i , xR

4 ) + P4(xI

i , xI

4),

(5)

where R=real, I= imaginary. The P2 part is the physical space-time and the other three

parts are the internal space. A 4-vector in this GU is in general complex and we conclude

that the Dirac theory implies a complex space-time. (In 1998, the author [3] suggested a

complex space-time, however, the derivation was not so satisfactory).

To describe a free particle with complex space-time, there must exist a well-behaved phys-

ical function Φ. Suppose we try a harmonic function that has continuous partial derivatives

3

of the second order and that satisﬁes the Laplace equation. For a stationary state, the

spatial distribution must be independent of time, so Φ can be factorized and we have

(6)

(7)

(8)

Φ(X, T ) = Φ(X)Φ(T ), X = x + ix, T = T + it,

∂2Φ(X)

∂x2 +

∂2(X)
∂x2 = 0,

∂2Φ(T )

∂t2 +

∂2Φ(T )
∂t

2 = 0.

Since x and x are basically independent, we can write Φ(X) = Φ(x)Φ(x), and similarly for

Φ(T ). The solution can be written as

Φ = A exp(±iωt ± ikx) · exp(±ωt ± kx).

We can choose the direction of k to be in the x ± ix axes. Note that there is a non-physical

solution where ω and k are changed into iω and ik in equation (8). Setting x = t = 0 , we

get a projected solution with only real space-time variables. The result is a free wave with

ω and k as the frequency and wave number. That is, a free particle is a free wave as well.

Consider Φ(T ) of equation (8) in the rest frame with the wave number k = 0. The

magnitude of ω is uniquely determined by the rest mass of the particle and its value can

assume to be ±ω and ±iω. If we require Φ to remain ﬁnite for all values of t and t, there

are four independent wave functions in the complex T-plane given as

φ1 = e−iωt−ωt, φ2 = e−ωt−tωt, φ3 = eiωt−ωt, φ4 = e−ωt+iωt,

(9)

(set t = t = 0 at the moment of the creation of the universe). If t and t are exchanged,

φ1 and φ2 would be exchanged and also for φ3 and φ4. Therefor, there is a real-imaginary

symmetry in the system. Deﬁne the generalized energy operator as

E =

ER +

E1 = i

It is easy to see that φ1 and φ2 have the same generalized energy. This can be viewed

as the system having an internal degree of freedom with two allowed states with the same

generalized energy in the complex T-plane. We therefore have an SU(2) internal symmetry.

Consider an SU(2) transformation U

The generalized energy of (ϕ1, ϕ2) does not change. That is, the generalized energy of

(ϕ1, ϕ2) is invariant under an SU(2) transformation, and (ϕ1, ϕ2) forms a basis represention

of an SU(2) group which has the three σi as generators. Similarly, it is also true for the

negative frequency solutions (φ3, φ4). By combining the four functions together we can write

2φ4. To get

physical solutions in the rest frame with only real time t, we project out the imaginery time

by putting t = 0 in equations (9) and (12). For a stationary state, we must also project

out the unphysical part by setting a2 = b2 = a′

2 = b′

2 = 0, otherwist the state is a mixture

of e−iωtand e−ωt. The four resulting functions form a complete set of basis functions of the

time t with internal symmetry. Any stationary state function of the particle can be written

as

ψ(−→r , t) = ψ(−→r )

If ψ(−→r , t) of equation (13) is a proper state function of the system, there must exist a

conserved current which is Lorentz covariant and satisﬁes the continuity condition. Noticing

that each ψi is a spinor function, it is natural to construct a spinor current jµ as

jµ = ψγµψ, ψ = ψ†γ0,

and require the continuity condition. We then get

ψ[iγµ∂µ − m)ψ] + [i∂µψγµ + m]ψ = 0.

Since ψ and ψ are linearly independent, the arguement in each of the square brackets must

vanish separately, and we get back the Dirac equation and its adjoint equation with m being

the rest mass of the particle. That is, complex space-time can reproduce the Dirac equation.

III. CLASSIFICATION OF FERMION ELEMENTARY PARTICLES

If no interaction exists between Pi and Pj in equation (5), the Lagrangian of the system

in GU is a sum of the Lj, j = 1, · · · 4, where Lj is the Lagrangian of Pj. It is eﬀectively a

4-body problem, and the total state function Ψ is a product function ΠΨj , where Ψj is a

free particle Dirac solution for Pj with a spin part and an xµ-part. The xµ-part of Ψj must

satisfy equation (7). The solution of equation (8) represents the xµ-parts of Ψ2Ψ3 . Since P2

is the physical space-time, Ψ2 must have good momentum, so there is only one momentum

solution for Ψ2, while Ψ3 can take two momentum solutions like those in equation (8). By

exchanging the xI

4 in P2 with xR

4 in P3, we get P1 and P4. Therefore, the pair P1P4 is just the

same system as the pair P2P3 with the exchange of xI

4 and xR

4 and the solution is obtained

by the same way. Thus there are 2 ⊗ 2 momentum states in Ψ . On the other hand, there

are 4 spin functions in Ψ. Since the spin in the physical space-time is an eigen state in the

rest frame and cannot mix with other internal states. Therefore, the total internal states

for a Dirac particle can be obtained as 2 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 2 = 2 ⊗ (1 ⊕ 3) ⊗ (1 ⊕ 3). That

is, fermions are grouped into doublets, then all the doublets are divided into color singlets

(leptons) and color triplets (quarks), then they are further divided into generation singlets

and generation triplets. There are two possibilities:

generation singlet (νee)(ud).

N. F.=not found yet. Take the fermion isospin T to be 1/2 and T 3 as 1/2 for the left-

hand side of the doublets and -1/2 for the other. Deﬁne the fermion hypercharge as SG/N,

where N is the multiplicity of the color multiplet (1 for leptons and 3 for quarks), and SG

is -1 for leptons and 1 for quarks (opposite sign for antiparticles). Then the electric charge

of the particle is given as Q = T 3 + Y /2.

It may be worthwhile to mention that when the momentum of the particle is zero, states

in GU are degenerate. However, since ±k/| ± k| = ±1 =lim
k→0

(±k/|k|), so the degeneracy is

removed.

IV. THE NON-OBSERVATION OF FREE QUARKS AND A POSSIBLE NEW

FREE QUARK

In the GU of equation (5), the real space xi is the overlap of P1 and P2, (Note that

the momentum pi in P2 is ∂L2/∂

dxi
dt

(cid:16)

, while that in P1 is ∂L1/∂
(cid:17)

dxi
dt

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

which is unphysical).

The states in P2 do not mix with other states. This can be regarded as saying that, in the

real space xi , there is a physical particle (from P2 ), and a non-physical particle (from P1

), which are not identical particles. The imaginary space xi is the overlap of P3 and P4.

There are two identical particles which are both non-physical and each has two momentum

states and two spin states, and can couple to singlets and triplets. If the principle of anti-

symmetrization for fermions can be generalized to be valid in the GU, then in the above list

of (A), the leptons of color singlets and generation triplets are anti-symmetric states and

can exist in free particle states, while the quarks of color triplets and generation triplets

are symmetric states and cannot exist in free particle states (as expected by experiments).

However, if there is no other condition such as “electric charge has to be quantized in units

7

of electron charge e”. then there is a possibility that the free quarks of color triplets and

generation singlet in (A) can exist in nature. On the contrary, free leptons with a color

singlet and a generation singlet can not be observed. Therefore, if the anti-symmetrization

principle works in the greater universe, the above possibility (B) should be ruled out due to

the existence of free electrons.

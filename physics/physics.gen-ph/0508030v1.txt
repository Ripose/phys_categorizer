The angle of deﬂection of a light ray by the gravitational ﬁeld of the Sun, at grazing incidence, is
calculated by strict and straightforward classical Newtonian means using the corpuscular model of
light. The calculation is presented in the historical and scientiﬁc contexts of Newton’s Opticks and
of modern views of the problem.

I.

INTRODUCTION

ries of gravity including General Relativity and Newton’s
gravity. Denoting the angles of deﬂection for these cases
by δGR and δN G, Weinberg’s general expression yields

Isaac Newton’s Opticks [1] — whose last edition, the
fourth, was published in 1730 — is entirely dedicated
to the description of experiments in optics. The sub-
title reads “A Treatise of the Reﬂections, Refractions,
Inﬂections & Colours of Light”. It is composed by three
Books. Book One synthesizes the previous knowledge on
the properties of light and is presented as a series of deﬁ-
nitions, axioms and propositions. Books Two and Three
are devoted to Newton’s experiments and to the many
discoveries he made therefrom. Book Three ends with a
series of 31 queries. In Newton’s words: “When I made
the foregoing Observations, I design’d to repeat most of
them with more care and exactness, (...) But I was then
interrupted, and cannot now think of taking these things
into farther Consideration. (...) I shall conclude with
proposing only some Queries, in order to a farther search
to be made by others.” [2].

The modern concept of the gravitational deﬂection of
light is very much an Einsteinian idea [3, 4], though traces
of the idea can be found in Newton’s Query 1, namely,
“Do not Bodies act upon Light at a distance, and by
their action bend its Rays, and is not this action (cæteris
paribus) strongest at the least distance?”. In conjunction
with its corpuscular model of light, which is explicitly
stated in Query 29 as “Are not the Rays of Light very
small Bodies emitted from shining Substances?”, one has
the whole scenario for a Newtonian calculation of the
gravitational deﬂection of light by a massive body.

However there is not such a discussion in the “Opticks”.
One should remember that Newton was entirely con-
cerned with the properties of light behavior in his daily
laboratory experiments.

In the next section I shall pursue on such a scenario
and calculate the Newtonian deﬂection of a light ray at
grazing incidence in the solar limb. The result is pre-
cisely the same as obtained with modern space-time cur-
vature calculations except for a factor of two. For exam-
ple, Weinberg [5] obtains the general solution for grazing
incidence at the Sun. The solution holds for various theo-

where G, c, MS and RS are the gravitational constant,
the speed of light, the Sun’s mass and the Sun’s radius,
respectively.

Einstein’s ﬁrst calculation of the gravitational deﬂec-
tion of light, in 1911 (see [3], for a historical account and
scientiﬁc references), was performed using the Equiva-
lence Principle and the equivalent mass-energy of a pho-
ton. The calculation yielded δN G. Only in his second
calculation, published in 1916, where he included the ef-
fect of space-time curvature, he obtained a value twice as
large as his ﬁrst calculation, i.e., δGR [3].

Before going on with the classical derivation of δN G,
it is worthwhile to mention an interesting note by I.
Bernard Cohen, in the Preface of the modern edition of
Opticks used here. On page xxxiii, he comments about
the Queries: “To be sure, the speculations of the Opticks
were not hypotheses, at least to the extent that they were
framed in questions. Yet if we use Newton’s own deﬁni-
tion, that ‘whatever is not deduced from the phenomena
is to be called an hypothesis’ they are hypotheses indeed.
The question form may have been adopted in order to al-
lay criticism, but it does not hide the extent of Newton’s
belief. For every one of the Queries is phrased in the neg-
ative! Thus Newton does not ask in truly interrogatory
way (Qu. 1) : ‘Do Bodies act upon Light at a distance...
?’ — as if he did not know the answer. Rather, he puts
it: ‘Do not Bodies act upon Light at a distance... ?’ —
as if he knew the answer well — ‘Why, of course they
do!’ ”

The constants of motion E and L are easily evaluated
at point C. Assuming that the particle speed at that point
is v one has

L = mvRS.

Since the light particle speed is very large — much
larger than the escape speed at the solar radius — one
can neglect the change in its magnitude and assume that
the gravitational ﬁeld changes only the velocity direction.
Making v ≡ c, the light speed in vacuum, the eccentricity
is written as

As expected, the light particle mass m cancels out
above. Also, the second term inside the parentheses is
readily veriﬁed to be much smaller than c2. Thus, the
eccentricity may be simpliﬁed to

The angle of deﬂection, given by eq. 4, can be written,

with the aid of eqs. 3 and 9 as

In conclusion, there is still the question of why New-
ton did not discuss the possibility of light ray deﬂection
by a massive heavenly body. Of course, he was well
acquainted with the relevant astronomical observations.
Solar eclipses were certainly of his knowledge and could
certainly motivate digressions on the gravitational bend-
ing of light. Nevertheless, there is nothing about such
issues in the Opticks. As mentioned above, his main con-
cerns were with the laboratory and daily-life behavior of
light.

bolic orbit about the Sun. For deﬂection on grazing incidence,
the distance CS is RS, the solar radius. For illustration pur-
poses, the bending is greatly exaggerated.

II. DEFLECTION OF A LIGHT RAY BY THE
SUN

Taking Queries 1 and 29 above at their face values, one
may proceed to calculate the deﬂection of a light ray by
the gravitational ﬁeld of a massive body.

A light ray, from a distant star, under the Sun’s gravi-
tational force ﬁeld describes the usual central force hyper-
bolic orbit. The deﬂection of the light ray is illustrated in
Fig. 1, with the bending greatly exaggerated for a better
view of the angle of deﬂection.

At grazing incidence through the solar limb, the dis-
tance CS is the solar radius RS. The angle β of the
asymptote to the hyperbole of eccentricity ǫ is given by

δN = π − 2β.

The angle of deﬂection of the light ray, δN , is shown

in the ﬁgure and is

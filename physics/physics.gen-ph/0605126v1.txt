Abstract

It is well known that the diﬀerence between Quantum Mechanics
and Classical Theory appears most crucially in the non Classical spin
half of the former theory and the Wilson-Sommerfelt quantization rule.
We argue that this is symptomatic of the fact that Quantum Theory is
actually a theory in multiply connected space while Classical Theory
operates in simply connected space.

1 Introduction

John Wheeler had stressed that the divide between Classical and Quantum
Theory lies in the spin half (of Fermions) [1]. This half integral spin gives rise
to such non Classical and purely Quantum Mechanical results as the anoma-
lous gyromagnetic ratio of the electron (g = 2). We will now argue that the
non Classical half integral spin feature arises from the multiply connected
nature of Quantum Spacetime, and it is this which distinguishes Quantum
Mechanics from Classical Theory. Speciﬁcally, we will argue that the usual
space R with a compactiﬁed space S1, in R
S1 reproces Quantum Me-
chanical spin. On the other hand, spacetime is simply connected in Classical
theory.

2 Multiply Connected Space on Spin

Let us start by reviewing Dirac’s original derivation of the Monopole (Cf.ref.[2]).
He started with the wave function

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

ψ = Aeıγ,

ψ = ψ1eıS,

K µ = ∂µS

He then considered the case where the phase γ in (1) is non integrable. In
this case (1) can be rewritten as

where ψ1 is an ordinary wave function with integrable phase, and further,
while the phase S does not have a deﬁnite value at each point, its four
gradient viz.,

is well deﬁned. We use temporarily natural units, ¯h = c = 1. Dirac then
goes on to identify K in (3) (except for the numerical factor hc/e) with the
electromagnetic ﬁeld potential, as in the Weyl gauge invariant theory.
Next Dirac considered the case of a nodal singularity, which is closely related
to what was later called a quantized vortex (Cf.
In
this case a circuit integral of a vector as in (3) gives, in addition to the
electromagnetic term, a term like 2πn, so that we have for a change in phase
for a small closed curve around this nodal singularity,

for example ref.[3]).

In (4) ~B is the magnetic ﬂux across a surface element d~S and n is the number
of nodes within the circuit. The expression (4) directly lead to the Monopole
in Dirac’s formulation.
Let us now reconsider the above arguments in terms of recent developments.
The Dirac equation for a spin half particle throws up a complex or non
Hermitian position coordinate [4, 5]. Dirac identiﬁed the imaginary part
with zitterbewegung eﬀects and argued that this would be eliminated once it
is realized that in Quantum Mechanics, spacetime points are not meaningful
and that on the contrary averages over intervals of the order of the Compton
scale have to be taken to recover meaningful physics [6]. Over the decades
the signiﬁcance of such cut oﬀ space time intervals has been stressed by T.D.

Lee and several other scholars as noted earlier [7, 8, 9, 10]. Indeed with a
minimum cut oﬀ length l, it was shown by Snyder that there would be a non
commutative but Lorentz invariant spacetime structure. At the Compton
scale we would have [11],

[x, y] = 0(l2)

and similar relations.
In fact starting from the Dirac equation itself, we can deduce directly the
non commutativity (5) (Cf.refs.[4, 5]).
Let us now return to Dirac’s formulation of the monopole in the light of the
above comments. As noted above, the non integrability of the phase S in (2)
gives rise to the electromagnetic ﬁeld, while the nodal singularity gives rise
to a term which is an integral multiple of 2π. As is well known [12] we have

S = ~p

~
∇

where ~p is the momentum vector. When there is a nodal singularity, as noted
above, the integral over a closed circuit of ~p does not vanish. In fact in this
case we have a circulation given by

Γ =

S

~
∇

·

I

I

d~r = ¯h

dS = 2πn

It is because of the nodal singularity that though the ~p ﬁeld is irrotational,
there is a vortex - the singularity at the central point associated with the
vortex makes the region multiply connected, or alternatively, in this region
we cannot shrink a closed smooth curve about the point to that point. In fact
if we use the fact as seen above that the Compton wavelength is a minimum
cut oﬀ, then we get from (7) using (6), and on taking n = 1,

(l = ¯h
2mc is the radius of the circuit and ¯h = 1 in the above natural units). In
other words the nodal singularity or quantized vortex gives us the mysterious
Quantum Mechanical spin half (and other higher spins for other values of
n). In the case of the Quantum Mechanical spin, there are 2
n/2 + 1 =
n+ 1 multiply connected regions, exactly as in the case of nodal singularities.

Indeed in the case of the Dirac wave function, which is a bi-spinor

is known [13], far outside the Compton wavelength, it is the usual spinor Θ,

preserving parity under reﬂections that predominates, whereas at and near
the Compton scale it is the spinor φ which predominates, where under a
reﬂection φ goes over to
The multiply connected nature of Quantum Spacetime and spin half can be
seen to emerge from (5). In fact given (5), it is immediately seen that we
cannot shrink a close circuit about the point x, y to a single point.
One can argue that starting from (5) it is possible to obtain directly Quantum
Mechanical spin and the Dirac representation. It has been shown in detail
[14, 15] that under a time elapse transformation of the wave function, (or,
alternatively, as a small scale transformation),

we get

ψ >

Equation (10) has been shown to lead to the Dirac equation when ǫ is the
Compton time. A quick way to see this is as follows: At the Compton scale
we have,

that is, we get the Quantum Mechanical spin. Next, we can easily verify,

provides a representation for the coordinates in (3), apart from scalar fac-
tors. As can be seen, this is also a representation of the Dirac matrices.
Substitution of the above in (10) leads to the Dirac equation

(γµpµ −

mc2)ψ = 0

because

Eψ =

where ǫ = τ (Cf.ref.[16]).
Indeed, as noted, Dirac himself had realized that his electron equation needed
an average over spacetime intervals of the order of the Compton scale to
remove zitterbewegung eﬀects and give meaningful physics. This again is

symptomatic of an underlying fuzzy spacetime described by a noncommuta-
tive space time geometry (7) or (4) [17].
The point here is that under equation (xxx), the coordinates xµ

mation over the indices. Infact, in the theory of the Dirac equation it is well

where σ’s are the Pauli matrices. As noted years ago by Bade and Jehle
(Cf.ref.[18]), we could take the σ’s or γ’s in (11) and (12) as the components
of a contravariant world vector, or equivalently we could take them to be
ﬁxed matrices, and to maintain covariance, to attribute new transformation
properties to the wave function, which now becomes a spinor (or bi-spinor).
This latter has been the traditional route, because of which the Dirac wave
function has its bi-spinorial character. In this latter case, the coordinates re-
tain their usual commutative or point character. It is only when we consider
the equivalent former alternative, that we return to the noncommutative ge-
ometry (5).
That is, in the usual commutative spacetime the Dirac spinorial wave func-
tions conceal the noncommutative character (5).

As is well known the energy spectrum for (13) is given by

If we require that (14) be identical to the Bohr spectrum, then m should
be a half integer, which also means that the conﬁguration space is multiply
connected. In the simplest case of a doubly connected space, we are dealing
S1, where S1 is a compactiﬁed space, generally considered to be a
wityh R2
Kaluza-Klein space. However we would like to point out the following: The
energy is given by

×

E =

S2

¯h2

(15)

In (15) there is an additional grounds state energy E = S2¯h2/2µρ2, where
µ is the reduced mass and ρ is the radius of the compactiﬁed circle S1. If ρ
were to be the Planck length as in the Kaluza-Klein theory, then this extra
energy becomes very large and is generally taken to be unobservable. On
the other hand if ρ is taken to be the Compton wavelength as in our earlier
discussion, then the above extra ground energy, as can be easily veriﬁed is
of the same orderas the usual energy. In any case it can be seen that the
Quantum Mechanical spin is a symptom of the multiply connected nature
of Quantum spacetime, even in this non relativistic example. We remark
that, as is well known, in (14), we can continue to take integral values of
the momentum m, provided, to the Coulomb potential energy an additional
energy

∆E = ¯h

(cid:18)q
is added. It is immediately seen that if in (16) r is of the order of the Compton
e2/mc2, then we recover e2.To put it another
wavelength, which is also
way, if there was no Coulomb interaction in the conventional theory, then
this additional contribution shows up as the Coulomb ﬁeld. This suggests
the origin of the fundamental charge itself from topological conditions.

2. In Dirac’s theory of displacement operators [6] the operator dx ≡
dx is a
purely imaginary operator, and is given by

∼

δx(dx + ¯dx) = δx2dx ¯dx = 0

if

as is tacitly assumed. However if

0(δx2) = 0

0(δx2)

then the operator dx becomes complex, and therefore, also the momentum
ı¯hdx and the position operator. In other words if (17) holds
operator, px ≡
good then we have to deal with complex or non-Hermitian coordinates. The
implication of this is that (Cf.[21] for details) spacetime becomes non- com-
mutative as seen above.
In any case here is the mysterious origin of the complex coordinates and
spin. It is the complex coordinates that lead from the Coulomb potential to
the electromagnetic part of the Kerr-Newman metric and the electron’s ﬁeld
including the anomalous gyro magnetic ratio which are symptomatic of the
electron’s spin [22]. It also means that the naked singularity is shielded by the
fuzzy spacetime (Dirac’s original averages over the zitterbewegung interval)
or equivalently the noncommutative geometry (5) (Cf. also [23]). Indeed,
if we remember that ~
S in (8) gives the momentum ~p, we can see that (8)
∇
is an expression of the Wilson-Sommerfeld quantization rule [24]. What all
this means is that the presence of a Fermion in usual simply connected space
tantamounts to making the space multiply connected - like a hole in a sheet.

Abstract

We submit a classical uniﬁcation of the special and general relativities via the new
isominkowskian geometry in which the two relativities are diﬀerentiated by the basic
unit. We then show that the uniﬁcation admits an operator image in which gravitation
veriﬁes the abstract axioms of relativistic quantum mechanics under a universal sym-
metry which is isomorphic to the Poincar´e symmetry. The compliance of the uniﬁcation
with available experimental data is indicated. This study has been permitted by the
recent achievement of suﬃcient mathematical maturity in memoir3f , axiomatic con-
sistency in memoir3t and generalized symmetry principles in memoir4v. More detailed
studies are presented in the forthcoming paper3u.

1. Introduction. One of the most majestic achievements of this century for mathemat-
ical beauty, axiomatic consistency and experimental veriﬁcations has been the special theory
of relativity (STR)1. By comparison, despite equally outstanding achievements, the general
theory of relativity (GTR)2 has remained aﬄicted by numerous problematic aspects at both
classical and quantum levels.

In view of the above, in this note we submit a formulation of the general relativity
via the axioms of the special, under the condition of preserving Einstein’s ﬁeld equations
and their experimental veriﬁcations. Our study is conducted via axiom–preserving maps of
conventional structures, called isotopies, initiated in ref.s3 and studied by various authors4,5.
This study has been permitted by the recent achievement of suﬃcient mathematical ma-
turity in memoir3f , axiomatic consistency in memoir3t and maturity in generalized symmetry
principles in memoir4v. More detailed studies are presented in the forthcoming paper3u.

The property at the foundation of this note is that the transition from the Minkowskian
metric η = Diag(1, 1, 1, −1) to a (3+1)-dimensional Riemannian metric g(x) is characterized
by a noncanonical transformation x → x′ = U × x, U × U t 6= I, for which (by ignoring hereon
the dash) g(x) = U × η × U t.

The above mathematically trivial occurrence has rather serious physical implications at
both classical and quantum levels. In fact, at the classical level it implies that gravitational
theories constructed over a Riemannian spaces do not possess invariant units of space and
time (evidently because they are not preserved by the noncanonical time evolution of the
theory by deﬁnition), thus implying evident ambiguities in the application of the theory to
actual measurements (e.g., because it is not possible to conduct releable measures, say, of
length, with a stationary meter varying in time) and other problematic aspects3t.

More generally, the noncanonical character of Riemannian theories of gravitation implies
that the still unresolved problematic aspects debated during this century on gravitation, quite
likely, are not due to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, but rather to the lack of proper mathematics
used in their treatment, which is the viewpoint adopted in this note.

At the operator level it is easy to see that, for consistency with the classical counterpart,
quantum gravity must have a nonunitary time evolution when referred to a conventional
Hilbert space over a conventional ﬁeld. It is now established3t that theories with nonunitary
time evolutions are aﬄicted by the following shortcomings: 1) They do not have invariant
units of space and time, by therefore lacking physically un-ambiguous applications to exper-
imental measurements; 2) they do not preserve Hermiticity in time, thus lacking physically
acceptable observabnles; and 3) they do not have unique and invariant numerical predictions
(because of the lack of uniqueness and invariance of the special functions needed for data
elaboration).

In an attempt to resolve the above problematic aspects in due time, in this note we submit
a novel formulation of gravity based on the following central assumptions: 1) Preservation
unchanged of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations and related experimental veriﬁcations; 2) classical
formulation of these equations under the uncompromisable conditions of possessing invariant
units of space and time, as it is the case for the special relativity; and 3) operator formulation
of gravity based on the axioms of conventional relativistic quantum mechanics.

2. Isominkowskian geometry. A study of the above conditions is permitted by a
novel form of mathematics called isomathematics originally proposed by Santilli3a and then
studies in various works3−5. It is characterized by liftings of conventional mathematics called
isotopies which map any linear local and canonical structure into its most general possible
nonlinear, nonlocal and noncanonical form, which is nevertheless capable of reconstructing
linearity, locality and canonicity on certain generalized spaces and ﬁelds called isospaces and
isoﬁelds.

The isotopies are ideally suited to study assumptions 1), 2) and 3) of Sect. 1 because

2

they are axiom-preserving by conception and construction, while the new formulations are
locally isomorphic to the original ones. This evidently ensures the preservation unchanged
of Einstein’s axiom ab initio. Jointly, the isotopies do permit the achievement of a theory
with a basic invariant unit, as we shall see.

The fundamental isotopy for relativistic theories is the lifting of the unit of conventional
theories, the unit I = diag. (1, 1, 1, 1) of the Minkowski space and of the Poincare’ symmetry,
into a well behaved, nowhere singular, Hermitean and positive–deﬁnite 4 × 4-dimensional
matrix ˆI whose elements have an arbitrary dependence on local quantities and, therefore,
can depend on the space–time coordinates x and other needed variables, I → ˆI = ˆI(x) > 0,
while the conventional associative product A × B among generic quantities A, B is lifted by
the inverse amount, A × B → A ˆ×B = A × ˆT × B, ˆI = ˆT −1.

Under these assumptions ˆI is the (left and right) generalized unit of the new theory,
ˆI ˆ×A = A ˆ× ˆI ≡ A, ∀A, called the isounit and ˆT is called the isotopic element. For consistency,
the totality of the original theory must then be reconstructed to admit ˆI as the correct (left
and right) unit. This implies the isotopies of numbers, angles, ﬁelds, spaces, diﬀerential
calculus, functional analysis, geometries, algebras, symmetries, etc.3r (see ref.3f for a recent
account).

Let M(x, η, R) be the Minkowski space with space–time coordinates x = {xµ} = {r, x4},
x4 = c0t (where c0 is the speed of light in vacuum), and metric η = Diag.(1, 1, 1, −1) over
the reals R = R(n, +, ×). Let ℜ(x, g(x), R) be a (3 + 1)–dimensional Riemannian space with
nowhere singular and symmetric metric g = gt = U × η × U t.

A study of conditions 1), 2), and 3) of Sect. 1 is then permitted by assuming as basic
isounit of our theory the quantity ˆI = U × U t = ˆI t > 0 with explicit form derivable form a
Riemannian metric via the isominkowskian factorization3o,3p

g(x) = ˆT (x) × η, ˆI(x) = [T (x)]−1 = U × U t.

(1)

As an example, for the case of the celebrated Schwarzschild’s metric2d, we have U × U t =
ˆI = Diag.((1 − M/r), (1 − M/r), (1 − M/r), (1 − M/r)−1) and similarly for other metrics.
Note that the positive–deﬁniteness of ˆI is assured by the locally Minkowskian character of
Riemann. Without loss of generality, the isounit can therefore be assumed herein as being
diagonal.

To construct the isotopies of the STR, also called isospecial relativity3h−3t, we ﬁrst need
the lifting of numbers and ﬁelds3g. For this we note that the conventional multiplicative unit
I is lifted into the isounit, I → U × 1 × U t = ˆI while the additive unit 0 remains unchanged,
0 → ˆ0 = U × 0 × U t = 0. The numbers are lifted into the so–called isonumbers, n → ˆn =
U × n × U t = n × ˆI = (n × m) × ˆI with lifting of the product n × m → ˆn ˆ× ˆm = ˆn × ˆT × ˆm.

3

The original ﬁeld R = R(n, +, ×) is then lifted into the isoﬁeld ˆR = ˆR(ˆn, ˆ+. ˆ×) for which
all operations are isotopic It is easy to see that ˆR is locally isomorphic to R by construction
and, thus, the lifting R → ˆR is an isotopy. Despite its simplicity, the lifting is not trivial,
e.g., because the notion of primes and other properties of number theory depend on the
assumed unit. For further aspects we refer to5r which also includes the isotopies of angles
and functions analysis. Note for later needs the identity, ˆn ˆ×A ≡ n × A.

Next, we need the lifting of the space M into the isominkowskian space ˆM = ˆM (ˆx, ˆη, ˆR)
ﬁrst proposed by Santilli in Ref.3h which is characterized by the isocoordinates x → ˆx =
U × x × U t = x × ˆI, and isometric η → ˆη(x) = U × η × U t ≡ g(x) although, for consistency,
the latter must be deﬁned on ˆR, thus having the structure ˆN = ( ˆNµν) = ˆη × ˆI = (ˆηµν) × ˆI.
The conventional interval on M is then lifted into the isointerval on ˆM over ˆR4h

(ˆx − ˆy)ˆ2 = (ˆx − ˆy)µ ˆ× ˆNµν ˆ×(ˆx − ˆy)ν = [(x − y)µ × ˆηµν × (x − y)ν] × ˆI =

= [(x1 − y1) × ˆT11 × (x1 − y1) + (x2 − y2) × T22 × (x2 − y2) +

+(x3 − y3) × T33 × (x3 − y3) − (x4 − y4) × T44 × (x4 − y4) × ˆI.

(2)

As one can see, the above interval coincides with the conventional Riemannian interval

byu conception, except for the factor ˆI.

It easy to see that ˆM is locally isomorphic to M and the lifting M → ˆM is also an
In particular, the isospace ˆM is isoﬂat, i.e., it veriﬁes the axiom of ﬂatness in
isotopy.
isospace over the isoﬁelds, that is, when referred to the generalized unit ˆI, otherwise ˆM is
evidently curved owing to the dependence ˆη = ˆη(x) = g(x). In other words, assumptions
(1) eliminate the curvature while preserving the Riemannian metric. As we shall see, this
appears to be essential to achieve a gravitational theory with an invariant basic unit. Note
that ˆM and ˆR have the same isounit ˆI. Studies of isocontinuty properties on isospaces have
been conducted by Kadeisvili4r and those of the underlying novel isotopology by Tsagas and
Sourlas4s.

The isominkowskian geometry3r is the geometry of isospaces ˆM , and incorporates in a
symbiotic way both the Minkowskian and Riemannian geometries. In fact, it preserves all
geometric properties of the conventional Minkowskian geometry, including the light cone and
the maximal causal speed co (see below), while jointly incorporating the machinery of the
Riemannian geometry in an isotopic form. As such, it is ideally suited for our objectives.

It should be indicated that this author has studied until the interior gravitational problem
via the isotopies of the Riemannian geometry. The use of the isominkowskian geometry for

4

the characterization of the exterior gravitational problem was briﬂy indicated in note3o and it
is studied in more details in this work. Also, the main line of the isominkowskian geometry
inclusive of the machinery of the Riemannian geometry are presented in this study for the
ﬁrst time.

To outline the new geometry, one must know that, unexpectedly, the use of the ordinary
diﬀerential calculus leads to inconsistencies under isotopies (e.g., lack of invariance) because
dependent on the assumption of the trivial unit 1 in a hidden way. The central tool of
the isominkowskian geometry is therefore the isodiﬀerential calculus on ˆM (ˆx, ˆν, ˆR), ﬁrst
introduced in3g, which is characterized by the isodiﬀerentials, isoderivatives and related
properties ˆdxµ = ˆI µ
µ × ∂/∂xν , ˆ∂µ = ˆ∂/ ˆ∂xµ =
ˆ∂xα/ ˆ∂xν = ˆηµν, ˆ∂µ/ ˆ∂xν = ˆηµα × ˆ∂xα/ ˆ∂xν = ˆηµν.
ν × ∂/∂xν , ˆ∂xµ/∂xν = δµ
ˆI µ
Note that the original axioms must be preserved for an isotopy. Thus, ˆ∂α ˆ∂ β = ˆ∂β ˆ∂α

µ × dxν, ˆ∂µ = ˆ∂/ ˆ∂xµ = ˆT ν

ν × dxν, ˆdxµ = ˆT ν

ν , ˆ∂xµ/ ˆ∂xν = ˆηµα

and, therefore, ˆ∂α ˆ∂β = T µ

α × ˆT ν

β × ∂µ∂ν.

Note also the hidden isoquotient3gA/ˆB = (A/B) × ˆI and isoproduct ˆ∂ ˆ× ˆ∂. Thus, by
including the isoquotient, the quantity ˆ∂ ˆ∂ should be moe rigorously written ˆ∂ ˆ× ˆ∂. This
results in an inessential ﬁnal multiplication of the expression considered -by ˆI and, as such,
it will be ignored hereon for simplicity.

The entire formalism of the Riemannian geometry can then be formulated on the isomin-
kowskian space via the isodiﬀerential calculus. This aspect is studied in details elsewhere3t.
We here mention: isochristoﬀel’s symbols ˆΓαβγ = ˆ1
ˆ×( ˆ∂α ˆηβγ + ˆ∂γ ˆηαβ − ˆ∂β ˆηαγ)× ˆI, isocovariant

The veriﬁcation, this time, of the Riemannian properties is shown by the fact that (under
ˆM over ˆR are
the assumed conditions) the isocovariant derivatives of all isometrics on
identically null, ˆηαβ|ˆγ ≡ 0, α, β, γ = 1, 2, 3, 4. This illustrates that the Ricci Lemma also
holds under the Minkovskian axioms.

A similar occurrence holds for all other axioms of the Riemannian geometry (including

the forgotten Freud identity, as we shall study in more detail elsewhere3u.

3. Clssical uniﬁcation of the special and general relativities. We are now
equipped to present, apparently for the ﬁrst time, the classical equations of our isominkowskian
formulation of gravity, here called isoeinstein equations on ˆMover ˆR, which can then be writ-

2 = 1

2 × ˆI, ˆNµν = ˆηµν × ˆI = gµν × ˆI, ˆk = k × ˆI

and k is the usual constant.

Despite apparent diﬀerences, it should be indicated that Eq.s (3) coincide numerically
with Einstein’s equations both in isospace as well as in their projection in ordinary spaces
for all diagonal Riemannian metrics. In fact, in which case ˆT is also diagonal with ˆη ≡ g(x).
µ × ∂α deviates from the conventional derivative ∂µ
by the isotopic factor ˆT . But its numerical value must be referred to ˆI = ˆT −1, rather than
I. This implies the preservation in isospace of the original value of∂µ and, consequently, of
the original ﬁeld equations.

In isospace, the isoderivative ˆ∂µ = ˆT α

For the case of the projection of in ordinary spaces, the isoquations are reducible to the
conventional equations multiplied by common isotopic factors which, as such, are inessential
and can be eliminated. In fact, the isochristoﬀel’s symbols deviate from the conventional
symbols by the same factor ˆT (again, because ˆη ≡ g), and the same happens with other
terms, except for possible redeﬁnition of the source when needed, thus preserving again the
conventional ﬁeld equations and related experimental veriﬁcations.

A more detailed study of Eq.s (3) and related isominkowskian geometry is presented in
the forthcoming Ref.3u, including the use of the forgotten Freud identity of the Riemannian
geometry in its isominkowskian realization.

In summary, the isominkowskian formulation of gravity permits a geometric uniﬁcation
of the special and general relativity into one single relativity, the isospecial relativity3s where
for ˆI = I = Diag.(1, 1, 1, 1) we have the special and for ˆI = ˆI(x) = U × U t we have the
general. The invariance of the isounit is illustrated below. More detailed studies are available
in the forthcoming paper3t.

4. Operator uniﬁcation of the special and general relativities. We now indicate
that the above classical uniﬁcation admit a step–by–step operator counterpart, here called
operator isogravity (OIG). It should be indicated from the outset that OIG is structurally
diﬀerent than the conventional quantum gravity (QG)6 on numerous grounds, e.g., because
OIG and QM have diﬀerent units, Hilbert spaces, etc. In particular, the word ”operator” in
OIG is suggested to keep in mind the diﬀerences with ”quantum” mechanics (as it should
also be for QG).

To identify OIG, we note that the original noncanonical transform U × U t = ˆI 6 =I is
mapped into a nonunitary transform on a conventional Hilbert space H over the complex
ﬁeld C(c, +, ×). The isounit of the operator theory is therefore ˆI = U × U † = ˆI, ˆT =
(U × U †)−1 = T † = ˆI −1, where the representation of gravity occurs as per Eq.s (1). Then,
OIG requires the isotopies of the totality of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) resulting
in a formulation known as relativistic hadronic mechanics (RHM)3t.

Besides the preceding isotopies R → ˆR and ˆM → ˆM, RHM is based on the lifting of the
Hilbert space H with states |Ψ >, |Φ >, ... and inner product < Φ|Ψ >∈ C(c, +, ×) into the

6

isohilbert space ˆH4t with isostetes | ˆΨ >= U × |Ψ >, | ˆΦ >= U × |Φ >, ..., isoinner product
< ˆΦ|ˆˆΨ >= U× < Φ|Ψ > ×U † =< ˆΦ| × ˆT × | ˆΨ > × ˆI deﬁned on the isoﬁeld ˆC(ˆc, ˆ+, ˆ×) with
isonormalization < ˆΨ| × ˆT × | ˆΨ >= 1.

We then have the iso–four–momentum operator3s pµ ˆ×| ˆΨ >= −ˆi ˆ∂µ| ˆΨ >, with fundamen-
tal isocommutation rules [ˆxµ,ˆˆpν] = U × [xµ, pµ] × U † = ˆxµ × ˆT × ˆpν − ˆpν × ˆT × ˆxµ = ˆi ˆ× ˆNµν.
The (nonrelativistic) isoheisenberg’ equations3b and isoschrodinger equations3t,3u can the be
written, in terms of the isodiﬀerential calculus of ref.3g

ˆi ˆ× ˆdA/ ˆdt = i × ˆIt × dA/dt = [A,ˆH] = A × ˆTs × H − H × ˆTs × A, ˆI = ˆIs × ˜It,

ˆi ˆ× ˆ∂t| ˆΨ >= i ˆIt × ∂t| ˆΨ >= H ×s | ˆΨ >=

= H × ˆTs × | ˆP si >= ˆE ˆ×s| ˆΨ >= E × ˆIs × ˆTs × | ˆΨ >≡ E × | ˆΨ > .

(4)

Note that the ﬁnal numbers of the theory are conventional. We also have the lsifting of
expectation values into the form ˆ<A ˆ> =< ˆΨ| × ˆT × A × ˆT × | ˆΨ > / < ˆΨ| × ˆT × | ˆΨ >, and the
compatible liftings of the remaining aspects of RQM3t. In particular, ˆI is the fundamental
invariant of the isotheory, i ˆd ˆI/ ˆdt = ˆI ˆ×H − H ˆ× ˆI ≡ 0.

It is easy to prove that RHM preserves all conventional properties of RQM4t. In partic-
ular: isohermiticity coincides with conventional hermiticity, H † ≡ H † (all quantities which
are originally observables remain, therefore, so under isotopies); the isoeigenvalues of isoher-
mitean operators are isoreal (thus conventional because of the identity ˆE ˆ×| ˆΨ >≡ E × | ˆΨ >);
RHM is form invariant under isounitary transforms ˆU ˆ× ˆU † = ˆU † ˆ× ˆU = ˆI.
In fact, we
have the invariance of the isounit ˆI → ˆI ′ = ˆU ˆ× ˆI ˆ×hatU † ≡ ˆI, of the isoassociative prod-
uct ˆU ˆ×(A ˆ×B) ˆ× ˆU † = ¯A ˆ× ¯B; etc; and the same occurs for all other properties (including
causality). Note that nonunitary transforms on H can always be identically rewritten as
isounitary transforms on ˆH, U = ˆU × ˆT 1/2, U × U † ≡ ˆU ˆ× ˆU † = ˆU † ˆ× ˆU = ˆI, under which
RHM is invariant3t.

It should be stressed that RHM is not a new theory, but merely a new realization of the
abstract axioms of RQM. In fact, RHM and RQM coincide at the abstract, realization–free
level where all distinctions are lost between I and ˆI, R and ˆR, M and ˆM , H and ˆH, etc. Yet,
RHM is broader than RQM, it recovers the latter identically for ˆI = I and can approximate
the latter as close as desired for ˆI ≈ I.

On summary, the entire formulation of RHM of memoir3t can be consistently specialized

for the gravitational isounit ˆI(x) yielding the proposed OIG.

5. The universal isopoincar´e symmetry of gravitation. An important property

7

of the isominkowskian formulation of gravity, which is lacking for conventional formula-
tions, is that of admitting a universal, classical and operator symmetry for all possible
Riemannian formulations of gravitation ﬁrst identiﬁed by Santilli3h−−3l under the name of
isopoincar´e symmetry ˆP (3.1), which results to be locally isomorphic to the conventional sym-
metry P (3.1)3h−3l.

The isosymmetry can be easly constructed via the isotopies of Lie’s theory3a,3d called Lie–
Santilli isoteory5 which essentially consists in the reconstruction of all branches of Lie’s theory
(universal enveloping algebras, Lie algebras, Lie group, transformation and representation
theories, etc.) for the generalized unit ˆI = [ ˆT (x)]−1. Since ˆI > 0, one can see from the
inception that the isopoincar´e symmetry is isomorphic to the conventional one, ˆP (3.1) ≈
P (3.1) (see ref.4t for a recent accounts).

The operator version of the isopoincar´e symmetry is characterized by the conventional
generators and parameter opnly lifted into isospaces over isoﬁelds X = {Xk} = {Mµν =
xµpν − xνp, pα} → ˆX = { ˆMµν = ˆxµ × ˆpν − ˆxν × ˆpµ, ˆpα}, k = 1, 2, ..., 10, µ, ν = 1, 2, 3, 4,
and w = {wk} = {(θ, v), a} ∈ R → ˆw = w × ˆI ∈ ˆR(ˆn, +, ˆ×). The isotopies preserve
the original connectivity properties3r. The connected component of P (3.1) is then given by
ˆP0(3.1) = S ˆO(3.1) ˆ× ˆT (3.1), where S ˆO(3.1) is the connected isolorentz group3h and ˆT (3.1)
is the group of isotranslations3k. ˆP0(3.1) can be written via the isoexponentiation as ˆeA =
ˆI + A/1! + A ˆ×A/2! + ... = (eA× ˆT ) × ˆI characterized by the isotopic Poincar´e–Birkhoﬀ–Witt
theorem3a,3d,5 of the underlying isoenveloping associative algebra

ˆP0(3.1) : ˆA( ˆw) = Πkˆei×X×w = (Πkei×X× ˆT ×w) × ˆI = ˜A(w) × ˆI.

(5)

Note the appearance of the gravitational isotopic element ˆT (x) in the exponent of the
group structure. This illustrates the nontriviality of the lifting and its nonlinear character,
as evidently necessary for any symmetry of gravitation. What is intriguing is that the
isopoincar´e symmetry recovers linearity on ˆM over ˆR, a property called isolinearity3t.

Conventional linear transforms on M violate isolinearity on ˆM and must then be replaced
with the isotransforms ˆx′ = ˆA( ˆw) ˆ× ˆX = ˆA( ˆw) × ˆT (x) × ˆx which can be written from (5) for
computational purposes (only) ˆx′ = ˜A(w) × ˆx. The preservation of the original dimension
is ensured by the isotopic Baker–Campbell–Hausdorﬀ Theorem3a,3d,5. Structure (5) then
forms a connected Lie–Santilli isogroup5 with laws ˆA( ˆw) ˆ× ˆA( ˆw′) = ˆA( ˆw′) ˆ× ˆA( ˆw) = ˆA( ˆw +
ˆw′), ˆA( ˆw) ˆ× ˆA(− ˆw) = ˆA(0) = ˆI(x) = [T (x)]−1.

As one can see, ˆP0(3.1) is noncanonical on M over R (e.g., because it does not preserve
the conventional unit I), but it is canonical on ˆM over ˆR, a property called isocanonicity
(because it leaves invariant by construction the isounit). This conﬁrms the achievement,
apparently for the ﬁrst time, of an operator theory of gravity verifying the fundamental

8

invariance of its unit. The invariance at the classical level is consequential.

The isodiscrete transforms3i are given by ˆπ ˆ×x = π×x = (−r, x4), ˆτ ˆ×x = τ ×x = (r, −x4),
where ˆπ = π × ˆI, ˆτ = τ × ˆI, and π, τ are the conventional inversion operators. Despite such a
simplicity, the physical implications are nontrivial because of the possibility of reconstructing
as exact discrete symmetries when believed to be broken, which is studied by embedding all
symmetry breaking terms in the isounit3s. One should be aware that this is a rather general
property of the Lie–Santilli isotheory, thus holding also for continuous symmetries. In fact,
contrary to a popular beliefs, this note shows that the Lorentz and Poincar´e symmetries are
exact for gravitation.

The use isodiﬀerential calculus on ˆM then yields the Lie–Santilli isoalgebra ˆp0(3.1)3k

[ ˆMµν,ˆ ˆMαβ] = i × (ˆηνα × ˆMµβ − ˆηµα × ˆMνβ − ˆηνβ × ˆMµα + ˆηµβ × ˆMαν),

[ ˆMµν, ˆpα] = i × (ˆηµα × ˆpν − ˆηνα × ˆpµ), [ˆpα,ˆˆpβ] = 0, ˆηµν = gµν(x),

(6)

where [A,ˆB] = A × ˆT (x) × B − B × ˆT (x) × A is the isoproduct (originally proposed
in 3b), which does indeed satisfy the Lie axioms in isospace, as one can verify. Note the
appearance of the Riemannian metric ˆηµν = gµν(x), this time, as the ”structure functions”
ˆηµν of the isoalgebra3a,3d,5. Note also that the momentum components isocommute (while
they are notoriously non–commutative for QG). This conﬁrms the achievement of an isoﬂat
representation of gravity.

The local isomorphism ˆp0(3.1) ≈ p0(3.1) is ensured by the positive–deﬁniteness of ˆT . In
fact, the use of the generators in the form ˆM µ
ν = ˆxµ ˆ×pν − ˆxν ˆ×ˆpµ would yield the conventional
structure constants under a generalized Lie product, as one can verify. The above local
isomorphism is suﬃcient, per se’, to guarantee the axiomatic consistency of OIG.

The isocasimir invariants of ˆp0(3.1) are the simple isotopic image of the conventional ones
C 0 = ˆI = [ ˆT (x)]−1, C (2) = ˆpˆ2 = ˆpµ ˆ×ˆpµ = ˆηµν ˆpµ ˆ×ˆpν, C (4) = ˆWµ ˆ× ˆW µ, ˆWµ =∈µαβπ ˆM αβ ˆ×ˆpπ.
¿From them, one can construct any needed gravitational relativistic equation, such as the
isodirac equation

(ˆγµ ˆ×ˆpµ + ˆi ˆ× ˆm) ˆ×| >= [ˆηµν(x) × ˆγµ(x) × ˆT (x) × ˆpν − i × m × ˆI(x)] × ˆT (x) × | >= 0,

{ˆγµ,ˆˆγν} = ˆγµ × ˆT × ˆγν + ˆγν × ˆT × ˆγµ = 2 × ˆηµν ≡ 2 × gµν, ˆγµ = ˆT 1/2

µµ × γµ × ˆI (no sum), (7)

Where γµ are the conventional gammas and ˆγµ are the isogamma matrices. Note that the
anti-iso-commutators of the isogamma matrices yield (twice) the Riemannian metric g(x),
thus conﬁrming the representation of Einstein’s (or other) gravitation in the structure of

9

Dirac’s equation. As an illustration, we have the Dirac–Schwarzschild equation given by
Eq.s (7) with ˆγk = (1 − 2M/r)−1/2 × γk × ˆI and ˆγ4 = (1 − 2M/r)1/2 × γ4 × ˆI. Similarly one
can construct the isogravitational version of all other equations of RQM.

These equations are not a mere mathematical curiosity because they establish the compat-
ibility of OIG with experimental data in particle physics in view of the much lower character
of gravitational over electromagnetic, weak and strong contributions. Our uniﬁcation of the
special and general relativities is, therefore, compatible with experimental evidence at both
classical and operator levels.

The space components S ˆO(3), called isorotations3i, can be computed from isoexponenti-
ations (5) with the explicit form in the (x,y)–plane (were we ignore again the factorization

(see3s for general isorotations in all there Euler angles). Isotransforms (8) leave invariant
all ellipsoidical deformations x × ˆT11 × x + y × ˆT22 × y + z × ˆT33 × z = R of the sphere
x × x + y × y + z × z = r. Such ellipsoid become perfect spheres ˆrˆ2 = (ˆrt × ˆδ × ˆr) × ˆIs in

In fact, the deformation of the semi-axes 1k → ˆTkk while the related units are deformed
of the inverse amounts 1k → ˆT −1
kk preserves the perfect spheridicity (because the invariant in
isospace is (Length)2×(Unit)2). Note that this perfect sphericity in ˆE is the geometric origin
of the isomorphism ˆO(3) ≡ O(3), with consequential preservation of the exact rotational
symmetry for the space–components g(r) of all possible Riemannian metrics.

Note that the above isotransforms are formally similar to the Lorentz transforms, as
expected from their isotopic character. Isotransforms (9) characterize the light isocone3s, i.e.,
the perfect cone in isospace ˆM . In a way similar to the isosphere, we have the deformation
of the light cone axes 1µ → ˆTµµ while the corresponding units are deformed of the inverse
amount 1µ → ˆT −1
µµ .

In particular, the isolight cone also has the conventionals characteristic angle, as a neces-
sary condition for an isotopy (the proof of the latter property requires the use of isotrigono-
metric and isohyperbolic functions). Thus, the maximal causal speed in isominkowski space
is the conventional speed c0. The identity of the light cone and isocones is the geometric
origin of the isomorphism S ˆO(3.1) ≈ SO(3.1) and, thus, of the exact validity of the Lorentz
symmetry for all possible Riemannian metrics g(x).

The isotranslations can be written x′ = (ˆei×ˆp×a) ˆ×ˆx = [x+a×A(x)]× ˆI , ˆp′ = (ˆei×ˆp×a) ˆ×ˆp =

ˆp, where Aµ = ˆT 1/2

µµ + aα × [ ˆT 1/2

µµ ,ˆˆpα]/1! + .... and they are also nonlinear, as expected.

Intriguingly, the isotopies identify one additional symmetry which is absent in the con-
ventional case. It is here called isoselfscalar invariance and it is given by the rescaling of
the unit ˆI → ˆI ′ = n2 × ˆI, where n is an 11-th parameter, under which the interval remains
invariant, ˆxˆ2 = (xµ × ˆT α
µ ) × ηαν × xν] × (n2 × ˆI). Note that,
even though n2 is factorizable, the corresponding isosymmetry is not trivial, e.g., because n2
enters into the argument of the isolorentz transforms (9).

µ × ηαν × xν) × ˆI ≡ [xµ × (n−2 × ˆT α

The same symmetry also holds for the isoinner product (whenever n does not depend
on the integration variable), < ˆΦ| × ˆT × | ˆΨ > × ˆI ≡< ˆΦ| × (n−2 × ˆT ) × | ˆΨ > ×(n2 × I).
Note ﬁnally that the latter symmetries have remained undetected throughout this century
because they required the prior discovery of new numbers, those with an arbitrary unit3g.

6. Inclusion of interior gravitation. The attentive reader may have noted that the
isotopies leave unrestricted the functional dependence of the isometric. Its sole dependence
on the coordinates is therefore a restriction which has been used so far for a representation
of exterior gravitation in vacuum.

In the general case we have isometrics with an unrestricted functional dependence, ˆη =
ˆT (x, x, ∂Ψ, ...) ×η, ˆT > 0, which, as such, can represent interior gravitation problems with an
unrestricted nonlinearity in the velocities, wave functions and their derivatives, as expected
in realistic interior models, e.g., of neutron stars, quasars, black holes and all that.

Note also that the isometric can also contain nonlocal–integral terms, e.g., representing
wave–overlappings3s. Nevertheless, the theory veriﬁes the condition of locality in isospace,

11

called isolocality, because its topology is everywhere local except at the unit3t,4r.

The general isopoincar´e symmetry is here deﬁned as the 11–dimensional set of isorota-
tions, isoboosts, isotranslations, isoinversions and isoselfscalar transforms. The restricted
isopoincar´e transforms are those in which the isounit is averaged into constants. The results
of this note therefore imply the following:

Theorem 1 .The 11-dimensional, general isopoincar´e symmetry on isominkowski spaces
over real isoﬁelds for well behaved and nowhere null isounits constitutes the largest possible
isolinear, isolocal and isocanonical invariance of isoseparation (2) for nonsingular isometrics
with positive-deﬁnite isounits, thus constituting the universal invariance of exterior and
interior gravitations.

The veriﬁcation of the invariant under the isopoincar´e transforms of all possible separa-
tion (2) is instructive. The maximal character of the isosymmetry can be proved as in the
conventional case. Note that for any arbitrarily given (diagonal) Riemannian metric g(x)
(such as Schwarzschild, Krasner, etc,) there is nothing to compute because one merely plots
the ˆTµµ terms in the decomposition gµµ = ˆTµµ × ηµµ (no sum) in the above given isotrans-
forms. The invariance of the separation xt × g × x is then ensured. The (2 + 2)–de Sitter or
other cases can be derived from the theorem via mere changes of signature or dimension of
the isounit.

7. Concluding remarks. In summary, in this note we have presented, apparently for
the ﬁrst time, a geometric uniﬁcation of the special and general relativities in both classical
and operator mechanics, as well as for both exterior and interior problems. The results
are centralluy dependent on the use of isominkowskian geometry as introduced in this note,
rather than the use of the isoriemannian form as studied in Ref.3s.

The classical and operator geometric uniﬁcation of the special and general relativities for
the exterior problem in vacuum is centrally depoendent on the achievement of a universal
symmetry for gravitation which, by conception and construction, is locally isomorphic to the
Poincar´e symmetr of the special relativity. This eliminates the historical diﬀerence between
the special and general relativities whereby the former admits a universal synnetry, while the
latter does not1,2. Note the necessity of the representation of gravity in isominkovski space
for the very formulation of its universal isopoincar´e symmetry. In fact, no isosymmetry can
be constructed in the Riemannian space, to our best knowledge.

The above occurrence has a number of implications. First, it allow to illustrate the
viewpoint expressed in Sect. 1 to the eﬀect that some of controversies in gravitation debated
over this century are not due to Einstein’s ﬁeld equations, but rather to insuﬃciencies in the
mathematics used for their treatment.

12

A typical case is the controversy whether the total conservation laws of general relativity
are compatible with those of the special relativity. Our representation of Einstein’s equations
via the novel isomathematics permits a resolution of this old controversy via a mere visual
examination.

Recall that the generators of all space-time symmetries characterize total conserved quan-
tities. The compatiobility of the total conservation laws of the general and special relativities
is therefore established by the visual observation that the generators of the Poincare’ and
isopoincare’ symmetries coincide.
In fact, only the mathematical operations on them are
changed in the transition from the relativistic to the gravitational case.

The isominkowskian treatment of gravity also permits a resolution of some of the limita-
tions of conventional gravitational models, such as their insuﬃciency to provide an eﬀective
representation of interior gravitational problems. In fact, conventional formulations of grav-
ity admit only a limited dependence on the velocities, while being strictly local-diﬀerential
and derivable from a ﬁrst-order Lagrangians (variationally self-adjoint3d), characteristics
which are evidently exact for exterior propblems in vacuum.

By comparison, interior gravitational problems, such as all forms of gravitational collapse,
are constitutred by extended and hyperdense hadrons in conditions of total mutual pene-
tration in large numbers into small regions of space. It is well known that these conditions
imply eﬀects which are arbitrarily nonlinear in the velocities as well as in the wavefunctions,
nonlocal-integral on various quantities and variationally nonselfadjoint3d,3e, (i.e. not repre-
sentable via ﬁrst-order Lagrangians). It is evident that the latter conditions are beyond any
scientiﬁc expectation of quantitative treatment via conventional gravitational theories.

The isominkowskian formulation of gravity resolve this limitation too and shows that it is
equally due to insuﬃciencies in the underlying mathematics. In fact, isogravitation extends
the applicability of Einstein’s axioms to a form which is ”direcly universal for exterior and
interior gravitations”, namely, capable of representing all exterior and interior conditions
considered (universality), directly in the x-frame of the experimenter (direct universality),
thus extending the above uniﬁcation to interior conditions.

As indicated earlier, this extension is due to the fact that the funcional dependence
of the metric in Riemannian treatments is restricted to the sole dependence on the local
coordinates, g = g(x), while under isotopies the same dependence becomes unrestricted,
g = g(x, v, φ, ∂ψ....) without altering the original geometric axioms. This results in geometric
uniﬁcation of exterior and interior problems, despite their sizable structural diﬀerences of
topological, analytic and other characters. The latter uniﬁcation was studied in details in
ref.3s under trhe isoriemannian geometry and it is studied with the isominkowskian geometry
in this note for the reasons indicated earlier.

A ﬁrst illustration of the extension of the axioms to realistic interior conditions is oﬀered
by the isoselfscalar transforms ˆTµµ → n−2 × ˆTµµ which permit the representation of electro-
magnetic waves propagating within physical media with local varying speed c = c0/n. This

13

allows the construction, apparently for the ﬁrst time, of Schwarzschild’s and other grav-
itational models for the interior of atmospheres and chromospheres with a locally varying
velocity of light. Applications to speciﬁc cases, such as gravitational horizons, is then ex-
pected to permit reﬁnements of current studies evidently due to deviations from the valud in
vacuum of the speed of light in the hyperdense chromospheres outside gravitational horizons.
Except for being well behaved (and non–null), the parameter n remains unrestricted by
the isotopies and, therefore, n = 1 in vacuum but otherwise it can be n > 1 or < 1. As a
result, the isopoincar´e symmetry is a natural invariance for arbitrary causal speeds, whether
equal, smaller or bigger than the speed of light. The former were known since Lorentz’s7a times
(see the related quotation by Pauli’7b). The latter have been predicted since some time in
interior problems only, but experimentally detected only recently, e.g., for the speed of pho-
tons traveling in certain guides8a,8b or for the speed of matter in astrophysical explosions8c−8e.
The recent Ref.8f has identiﬁed solutions of conventional relativistic equations with arbitrary
speeds in vacuum of which ˆP (3.1) is evidently the natural invariance).

Despite the local variation of c, the maximal causal speed on ˆM over ˆR remain c0 again,
because the change c → c0/n is compensated by an inverse change of the unit. By recalling
that the STR is evidently inapplicable (and not ”violated”) for arbitrary causal speeds,
we can therefore say that the isotopies render the STR universally applicable, not only for
classical and operator gravitation, but also for arbitrary causal speeds.

Also the light isocone remains applicable for interior gravitational cases with arbitrary c.
As such, the light isocone appears to be more appropriate than the conventional light cone
for calculations, e.g., outside gravitational horizons which, being composed of hyperdense
chromospheres, do not admit the conventional speed of light in vacuum c0.

The indication of a number of developments currently under study appears recommend-
able. First, we note that the the zeros of the space (time) component of the isounit represent
gravitation horizons (singularities)3s. This representation is trivially equivalent to the con-
ventional one for the exterior case in vacuum. However, gravitational collapse is a typical
interior case for which the isotopic representation becomes nontrivial, e.g., because it permits
the inclusion of the nonlinear, nonlocal and noncanonical eﬀects indicated earlier.

Note that the zeros of the isounit have been excluded from Theorem 1 because of their

yet unknown topological structure.

Another aspect which is under study is the iso–grand–uniﬁcation3s, i.e., the inclusion of
gravitation in the uniﬁed gauge theories of electroweak interactions via its embedding in the
unit of the theory. If successful, these studies would extend the uniﬁcation of this note to
electroweak interactions.

It should be also indicated that the isotopies with basic lifting I → ˆI(x, Ψ, ...) = ˆI †
constitute only the ﬁrst step of a chain of generalized methods3f . The second class is given by
the genotopies3a in which the isounit is no longer Hermitean. This broader class geometries
in a natural way the interior irreversibility and it has been used, e.g., for the black hole

14

model of ref.4d. The third class of methods is given by the (multi–valued) hyperstructures, in
which the generalized unit is constituted by a set of non–Hermitean quantities. The latter
most general known class appears to be particularly signiﬁcant for quantitative studies of
biological structures in which the conventional RQM is manifestly inapplicable due to its
reversibility.

Also, the isotopies, genotopies and hyperstructures admit antiautomorphic images, called
isodualities, and charactrized by the map ˆI → − ˆI d = − ˆI † which are currently under study
for antimatter3q. In this case the energy–momentum tensor of antimatter becomes negative–
deﬁnite, thus removing a problem of compatibility between the current representations of
antimatter in classical and particle physics. The gravitational treatment of antimatter via
the isodualities of the isominkowskian geometry will be studied elsewhere.

On historical grounds, we note that, as studied in detail in memoir3t for the general
case of RHM, our OIG can be interpreted as a nonunitary completion of RQM considerably
along the historical E − P − R argument9a for which yon Neumann theorem9b and Bell’s
inequalities9c do not apply evidently because of its nonunitary structure.

Moreover, from the abstract identity of the right modular associative action H × |Ψ >
and its isotopic image ˆH ˆ×| ˆΨ >, one can see that the isoeigenvalue equation ˆH ˆ×| ˆΨ >=
E ˆT ×| ˆΨ > characterizes an explicit and concrete operator realization of the ”hidden variable”
λ = λ(x, ...) ≡ ˆT . Our isotopic formulation of gravity can therefore be interpreted as a
realization of the theory of hidden variables. After all, the ”hidden” character of gravitation
in our theory is illustrated by the recovering of the conventional unit under the isoexpectation
value ˆ< ˆI ˆ> = I.

In conclusion, the viewpoint we have attempted to convey in this note is that an axiomat-
ically consistent operator formulation of gravity always existed. It did creep in un–noticed
until now because embedded where nobody looked for, in the unit of RQM.

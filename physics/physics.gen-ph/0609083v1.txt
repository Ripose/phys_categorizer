Monte Carlo methods. Figure 1 shows the geometry
used in the “2.45 MeV w/shielding” detector response
simulation. The cavitation ﬂuid, modeled as described in
footnote 13 of [1], consists of carbon, deuterium, chlorine,
oxygen, nitrogen, and uranium. The simulation, using
Geant4 [2], includes all relevant neutron interactions,
particularly elastic scattering, thermal capture, (n, n′γ)
scattering, and neutron-induced ﬁssion.

To calculate the response function, neutrons of energy
2.45 MeV, emitted isotropically from the center of the
ﬂask, scatter through the materials. When a neutron
elastically scatters protons in the liquid scintillator, the
recoil energies are converted to equivalent electron en-
ergies [3], summed, and then smeared according to the
detector’s resolution function, eventually obtaining the
response function g(Eee).

In the same manner, I calculate the other response
functions with the following changes: the “2.45 MeV”
simulation does not include the paraﬃn shield, and the
radioisotope [4, 5] simulations “Cf-252” and “PuBe” as-
sume there are no intervening scattering materials be-
tween the sources and the detector.

Statistical methods. Following the notation of [6], the

raw data from Fig. 9(b) of [1] are

nk = “cavitation oﬀ” counts in channel k
′
k = “cavitation on” counts in channel k.
n

Each run is 300 s in duration, and Fig. 4 of [7] shows the
background-subtracted signal n′

nk.

The nk background data are modeled by a sum of two
k data are modeled by the same

exponentials, and the n′
background function plus the scaled response function,

The binned response function gk, is found by averaging
g(Eee) over the energy range of channel k.

Note that, under proper conditions [6], χ2
λ,p asymptoti-
cally approaches a χ2 distribution. Moreover, better ﬁts
give lower values of χ2

mines the ﬁve ﬁt parameters Ai. See Fig. 2(a) for the ﬁt
using the “Cf-252” response function.

λ,p. Minimization [8] of χ2

To determine the distribution f (χ2

λ,p) for a given ﬁt, I
sample from many synthetic data sets, each chosen, for
k = 11, . . . , 249, from Poisson distributions of mean value
yk and y′
k . In the Comment, I report the goodness-of-ﬁt
as a Z-value, deﬁned by

which expresses the observed value of χ2
λ,p in terms of
the equivalent number of standard deviations from the
mean of a normal distribution. As shown in Fig. 2(b),
the observed value of χ2
λ,p for the “Cf-252” ﬁt is within
one equivalent standard deviation and is therefore sta-
tistically consistent. The other three ﬁts are outside ﬁve
equivalent standard deviations, and are therefore statis-
tically inconsistent.

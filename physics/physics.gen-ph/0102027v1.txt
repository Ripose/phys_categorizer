A Reconciliation of
Collision Theory and Transition State Theory

Yong-Gwan Yi∗

February 20, 2014

Abstract

A statistical-mechanical treatment of collision leads to a formal connec-
tion with transition-state theory. This paper suggests that collision theory
and transition-state theory might ultimately be joined as a collision induced
transition state theory.

Collision theory and transition-state theory are alternative approaches to chem-
ical reaction rates [1]. There have been many important extensions of the kinetic
theory of collision and modiﬁcations of the transition-state theory. In this paper, I
should like to point out that above all collision theory and transition-state theory
could have been joined at their early stages as a collision induced transition state
theory. I shall sketch a statistical-mechanical treatment of collision and its formal
connection with transition-state theory.

Consider a collision process between two molecules of A and B. We can discuss
in the coordinate system of the center of mass the collision that occurs between
the two molecules. All of the energy which goes into exciting the activated complex
must come from the energy of relative motion of the reactants. Energy in the center
of mass motion cannot contribute. According to the kinetic theory of collision, the
rate constant has to be weighted by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function
f (u) of relative speed u, with integration over speeds from zero to inﬁnity, to give
the overall average rate constant:

where σ is the collision cross section. The rate constant in this expression is given
by M. Trautz in 1916 and by W. C. M. Lewis in 1918. It is convenient to integrate
over the translational energy instead of the speed u.

It is instructive to evaluate the rate constant in terms of energy states instead
of direct integration. We now consider the basic method of statistical mechanics of
evaluating partition function [2]. Statistical mechanics states:

The partition function is a sum over all states Ω, very many of which
have the same energy. One can perform the sum by ﬁrst summing over
all the Ω(E) states in the energy range between E and E + δE, and then
summing over all such possible energy ranges. Thus

Q =

e−En/kB T =

Ω(E)e−E/kB T .

The summand here is just proportional to the probability that the sys-
tem has an energy between E and E + δE. Since Ω(E) increases very
rapidly while exp(−E/kBT ) decreases very rapidly with increasing E,
the summand Ω(E) exp(−E/kBT ) exhibits a very sharp maximum at
some value E∗ of the energy. The mean value of the energy must then
be equal to E∗, and the summand is only appreciable in some narrow
range ∆E∗ surrounding E∗. The partition function must be equal to
the value Ω(E∗) exp(−E∗/kBT ) of the summand at its maximum mul-
tiplied by a number of the order of ∆E∗/δE, this being the number of
energy intervals δE contained in the range ∆E∗. Thus

But, if the system has f degrees of freedom, the last term on the right is
at most of the order of ln f and is thus utterly negligible compared to the
other terms which are of the order of f . Hence, the result agrees with
the general deﬁnition S = kB ln Ω(E∗) for the entropy of a macroscopic
system of mean energy E∗.

We have seen the basic method of statistical mechanics of evaluating the parti-
tion function. If we apply this to the integration of Eq. (1), we expect an expression
for the rate constant to be roughly

kC = σu∗

∆E∗
δE (cid:19)

(cid:18)

Ω(E∗)e−E

/kB T ,

where u∗ is a relative velocity for reaching the activated state. This summation
indicates that the integration over the translational energy has a very sharp maxi-
mum at the activation energy E∗. The width ∆E∗ of the maximum, given by the
square root of the dispersion, is very small relative to E∗ for a macroscopic system.
The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function we have used is the one normalized
to unity on integration over all states. For the results of more realistic calculation
the normalization should be expressed in its explicit form. The following expression
is then obtained:

kC = σu∗

This equation may also be written in terms of an entropy change in reaching
the activated state. As (∆E∗/δE)Ω(E∗) represents a number of energy states in
the activated state, the expression for the rate constant in terms of entropy change
will be

kC = σu∗e∆S

The basic method of statistical mechanics shows how an entropy term can be intro-
duced in the kinetic theory expression. It becomes evident that the kinetic theory of
collision does not lack the entropy term that should appear in the expression for the
equilibrium constant. In a system of chemical reaction the entropy of the system is
a function of energy E, volume V , and the number of molecules N : S = S(E, V, N ).
Here ∆S∗ represents the change in entropy due to the change in energy in reaching
the activated state. Hence, we can replace ∆S∗ in Eq. (6), using the thermodynamic
relations, by its generalization

for a system of chemical reaction. The rate constant can then be written in a general
form

kC = σu∗e−∆G

/kB T ,

where ∆G∗ is the Gibbs energy change in going from the initial to the activated
state. The evaluation of collision in terms of energy states disproves that collision
theory of reaction rates is not consistent with the fact that at equilibrium the
ratio of rates in the forward and reverse directions is the equilibrium constant:
The kinetic theory expression provides us with a kinetic theoretical derivation of
the expression for the equilibrium constant, relating the macroscopic equilibrium
constant to quantities that describe the situation on the molecular scale.

The transition-state theory was published almost simultaneously by H. Eyring
and by M. G. Evans and M. Polanyi in 1935. The rate equation for a bimolecular
reaction derived by this theory of reaction is

The partition functions QA and QB relate to the two reactants, and Q‡ is a special
type of partition function for the activated complex.
It is just like a partition
function for a normal molecule, except that one of its vibrational degrees of freedom
is in the act of passing over to the translation along the reaction coordinate.

Equation (5) is very suggestive in relating collision theory to transition-state the-
ory. The kinetic theory expression leads us to an idea of connecting with transition-
state theory formula. Identifying Q‡ with (∆E∗/δE)Ω(E∗), we can put both theo-
ries into some perspective. From their formal expressions the reaction can be viewed
as a succession of two steps − collision and transition state. The overall rate is then
given by the sum of two average lifetimes: rate = (k−1
T S)−1. The rate reads

The kinetic theory counts every suﬃciently energetic collision as an eﬀective one.
Equation (10) suggests, however, correcting the collision frequency by involving the
translation along the reaction coordinate in the evaluation of the partition function
over the translational energy states. The essential feature of the argument is that
transition state is brought about by energetic collisions and that the rate of a

3

reaction is determined by the frequency of these collisions and by the resulting
translations along the reaction coordinate.

The dependence of the overall reaction rate on the relative rates of collision
and transition state reﬂects the most important aspects of unimolecular reactions
[3]. Equation (10) is in exact agreement in form with the rate equation given by
Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory of unimolecular reactions. The
distribution function that has been used in RRKM theory is equal in expression
to that given by the basic method of statistical mechanics of evaluating partition
function. But the present discussion has shown the rate equation in a general for-
mulation of bimolecular reactions, and thus has given it a much wider applicability.
The formalism provides a framework in terms of which molecular reactions can be
understood in a qualitative way. Usually, the kinetic theory values are too high
for all except atom−atom reactions. Hence, the transition-state theory values can
be regarded as exerting important control over the rates of molecular reactions. It
might be due to this high-pressure limit that has led kT S to much closer agreement
with experiment.

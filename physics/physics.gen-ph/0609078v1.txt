Abstract

We make remarks on Fern´andez Guasti’s paper [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 39 (2006)

11825-11832] by pointing out some mistakes Fern´andez Guasti derived therein.

PACS number: 45.20.Dd, 02.60.Cb, 45.05.+x

Fern´andez Guasti just showed that a time-dependent oscillator equation could be solved numer-

ically for various trajectories in amplitude and phase variables [1]. His solutions exhibit a ﬁnite

time-dependent parameter whenever the squared amplitude times the derivative of the phase is

invariant. Most of his results were based on the second-order linear non-autonomous diﬀerential

which might be related to a Schr¨odinger equation [2].

Let the coordinate variable q be written in terms of amplitude A and phase s variables as

equation

d2q(t)
d t2 + Ω2(t)q(t) = 0

Thus, the equation (1) can also be written as

q(t) = A(t)cos[s(t)].

Ω2(t) =

d2{A(t)cos[s(t)]}
d t2
A(t)cos[s(t)]

.

Fern´andez Guasti then presented some simpliﬁed examples together with the mathematical ex-
pression of Ω2(t) (ﬁgures included).
The present author followed Fern´andez Guasti’s approaches, but got diﬀerent results (say, the
mathematical expression of Ω2(t) for Example 1 (cf. Attenuated amplitude in [1]). To be sys-
tematic and speciﬁc, some remarks could be made below for the readers’ interests or comparison.

Firstly, equations (2) and (3) could give us

where ˙A = dA(t)/dt,
˙s = ds(t)/dt, ¨A = d2A(t)/dt2, ¨s = d2s(t)/dt2. Based on these expres-
sions, we can easily derive Ω2(t) following the equation (3). For the illustrated Example 1 (by

Fern´andez Guasti in [1]), as A(t) = A0√2 [3 + tanh(α t)]2, s(t) = ω t, (ω is the frequency and is
a constant), we found out one mistake (diﬀerent sign) presented in [1] : the sign of α tanh(α t)
inside the second term :[ω tan(ω t) + α tanh(α t)] of the numerator for Ω2(t) should be negative
α tanh(α t)] inside the second

term of the numerator)! This is understandable considering the ﬁrst and second terms in the

right-hand-side (RHS) of the equation (5) above.

Meanwhile Fern´andez Guasti missed the consideration of cos[s(t)] = 0 (s(t) = (n

) which will cause singularities or divergences in the (RHS) of the equation (3) or
Ω2(t). That’s why there are many kinks for those curves relevant to Ω(t) shown in Figs. 1 and
2 (cf. red upper curves in [1] therein).
Furthermore, Fern´andez Guasti demonstrated the last example in the Section (Exact Invariant)

with the prescribed (cf. the equation (7) in [1])

and A(t) = A0√2 [3 + tanh(α t)]2. He obtained a complicated expression of Ω(t) (cf. the long
mathematical expression below the equation (7) in [1] which is at page 11829 of [1]) which after

the present author checked is also false! In fact, we derived

Ω(t) =

[3 + tanh(αt)]2 +

by noting that, from our equation (5), for the prescribed A(t) and s(t), A ¨s =

2 ˙A ˙s which can
simplify many mathematical manipulations (the present author thought that Fern´andez Guasti
possibly mishandled the signs of both A ¨s and 2 ˙A ˙s and then got the false expression in [1]!).
Here, we remind the readers that

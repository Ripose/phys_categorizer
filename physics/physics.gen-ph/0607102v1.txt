MODIFIED NEWTONIAN DYNAMICS AS A PREDICTION
OF GENERAL RELATIVITY

SABBIR A. RAHMAN

E-mail: sarahman@alum.mit.edu

ABSTRACT

We treat the physical vacuum as a featureless relativistic continuum in motion,
and explore its consequences. Proceeding in a step-by-step manner, we are able
to show that the equations of classical electrodynamics follow from the motion
of a space-ﬁlling ﬂuid of neutral spinors which we identify with neutrinos. The
model predicts that antimatter has negative mass, and that neutrinos are matter-
antimatter dipoles. Together these suﬃce to explain the presence of modiﬁed
Newtonian dynamics as a gravitational polarisation eﬀect. The existence of
antigravity could resolve other major outstanding issues in cosmology, including
the rate of expansion of the universe and its ﬂatness, the origin of gamma ray
bursts, and the smallness of the cosmological constant. If our model is correct
then all of these observations are non-trivial predictions of Einstein’s general
theory of relativity.

1. Introduction

In a recent paper1, Blanchet showed that if there were to exist a space-ﬁlling
‘aether’ consisting of exotic dark matter particles which take the form of matter-
antimatter dipoles, then this would satisfactorily explain the existence of modiﬁed
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) as a simple gravitational polarisation eﬀect, in com-
plete analogy with the polarisation of dielectrics in classical electrodynamics.

By treating the physical vacuum as a featureless relativistic continuum, we are
able to show that general relativity gives rise to precisely the scenario described by
Blanchet, and therefore that MOND is a non-trivial prediction of general relativity. In
particular, our model predicts that antimatter has negative mass and that neutrinos
take precisely the form of matter-antimatter dipoles. Taken together these proper-
ties also have the potential to resolve a number of the most important outstanding
problems in cosmology, including the apparent mass of the neutrino, the presence of
dark matter, the existence of dark energy, the apparent ﬂatness of the universe, the
origin of gamma ray bursts, and the smallness of the cosmological constant.

The structure of our paper is as follows. We begin in

2 with two basic premises,
§
namely (i) that the theory of relativity holds, and (ii) that the physical vacuum

is a featureless relativistic continuum in motion. In
3 we show that it is possible
§
to describe the whole of classical electrodynamics in terms of the motion of a two-
component relativistic ﬂuid where each component is a time-reversed version of the
other. In
4 we show that the presence of this two component ﬂuid is a prediction
§
of general relativity, and that the ﬂuid particles are chargeless neutral spinors which
can be identiﬁed with neutrinos. We then show that these neutrinos have precisely
the properties required to explain the occurrence of modiﬁed Newtonian dynamics,
and hence that MOND is a consequence of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. In
5 we outline brieﬂy how the prediction of antigravity might potentially resolve some
§
6 with a summary
of the other major outstanding issues in cosmology. We end in
§
and discussion of our results.

2. Spacetime and the Physical Vacuum

In this section we establish the reference system and the coordinates that will be
used to describe the dynamics of the vacuum, and we show how Maxwell-like equa-
tions appear as identities simply as a consequence of assuming that the underlying
spacetime is Lorentzian rather than Galilean.

2.1. Coordinates and Reference Frames

We begin our investigation with the assumption that the physical vacuum is noth-
ing but a featureless, space-ﬁlling, continuous relativistic ﬂuid (i.e. a relativistic
continuum), whose properties are described completely by its motion throughout
(Minkowski) spacetime. In particular, we make no prior assumptions about possible
substructure or the mass density of the vacuum, so that the only physical dimensions
entering our discussion are those of length and time.

Let us consider an arbitrary relativistic inertial frame of reference in M 3,1 with
4-coordinates xµ = (ct, x, y, z), so that the spacetime partial derivatives are given
by ∂µ = ( 1
It is important to note that

reference used.

Let τ be the proper time in this inertial frame, and let r denote the 3-position
(x, y, z) of a point in the continuum. Considering the instantaneous motion at proper
time τ of the continuum at a point r, the 3-velocity of either component of the
continuum at that point as measured by the inertial frame is,

where t is the time as measured by a clock moving with the continuum. We can

uum as,

uµuµ = c2,
where partial derivatives ∂νuµ are written as uµ,ν for convenience.

uµ,νuµ = 0 ,

2.2. Maxwell-Like Equations

Let us deﬁne the tensor f µν as the antisymmetrised derivative of the 4-velocity,

Then f µν satisﬁes the Jacobi identity,

f µν = uν,µ

uµ,ν .

−

f µν,λ + f νλ,µ + f λµ,ν = 0 ,

and we can deﬁne a 4-vector jµ proportional to the divergence of f µν,

jµ =

∂νf µν ,

c
4π

∂µjµ = 0 .

which has vanishing 4-divergence on account of the antisymmetry of f µν,

Equations (6) and (7) are reminiscent of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous
Maxwell’s equations, respectively, which leads us naturally to consider how classical
electrodynamics might arise in this model.

3. Classical Electrodynamics as Relativistic Fluid Dynamics

Given the appearance of Maxwell-like equations (6) and (7) it is natural to ask
whether our simple model of the physical vacuum can account for classical electrody-
namics. We show here that this is indeed the case if the continuum ﬂuid consists of
two components which are matter-antimatter conjugates of each other.

3.1. The Continuum Gauge

4-velocity of the continuum,

The ﬁrst step would be to associate the electromagnetic 4-potential Aµ with the

Aµ = kuµ = (φ, A) = (kcγ, kγv) .

(9)

where k is a positive dimensionful constant included to ensure consistency of units on
both sides. However the scalar potential φ = kcγ would then be restricted to positive
values, resulting in an asymmetry between the descriptions of positive and negative
chargesa.

For a charge-symmetric description of electrodynamics it is necessary to split the
electromagnetic potential 4-vector Aµ into the sum of two components Aµ
+ and Aµ
−
+ and uµ
which we identify with two independent continuum 4-velocities uµ
−,

Aµ = Aµ

+ + Aµ

− , where Aµ

+ = kuµ

+ = (φ+, A+) , Aµ

− =

kuµ

− = (φ−, A−) . (10)

−

A charge-symmetric description of electrodynamics therefore requires that the
vacuum be a continuum consisting of two components each in motion which are
related by reversal of time signatureb. The condition (4) implies the following covariant
constraint for both Aµ

+ and Aµ
−,

Aµ

+A+µ = Aµ

−A−µ = k2c2 .

(11)

We will refer to conditions (10) and (11) as the ‘continuum gauge’. This is a
non-standard choice of gauge, and we will demonstrate its consistency in
3.2 where
§
we show that any electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration can be described uniquely by a
potential 4-vector ﬁeld with the form of (10) satisfying the continuum gauge condi-
tions.

The antisymmetric ﬁeld-strength tensor can now be deﬁned as,

F µν = Aν,µ

Aµ,ν

(E, B) .

−

∼

Other standard properties now follow in the usual way. From the deﬁnition (12),

F µν satisﬁes the Jacobi identity,

F µν,λ + F νλ,µ + F λµ,ν = 0 ,

and this is just the covariant form of the homogeneous Maxwell’s equations. One can
deﬁne the 4-current as the 4-divergence of the ﬁeld-strength tensor,

−

q/r for a negative charge.

aFor example, one can have φ = kcγ = q/r for the scalar potential of a positive charge but not
φ = kcγ =
bAlthough the introduction of two continuum components may seem slightly ad hoc at present,
the opposite time signatures of their contributions to the 4-potential means that uµ
− are
associated with the motion of ﬂuid particles and antiparticles respectively, whose existence will be
shown in
4 to be a necessary consequence of general relativity. The opposite sign of their respective
contributions is due to the opposite direction of propagation in time of the particles and antiparticles.
The ﬂuid particles themselves can be identiﬁed with neutrinos, which will be seen to be responsible
both for cold dark matter and for the emergence of modiﬁed Newtonian dynamics.

and this is the covariant form of the inhomogeneous Maxwell’s equations. Charge

where Q, M and V µ = (cγV , γV V) are the charge, mass and 4-velocity vector of

where the sign of the 0-component of the 4-current appears to ensure that the 0-
component V 0 of the charge 4-velocity is positive. The gauge based upon a single
4-vector ﬁeld was precisely that introduced by Dirac in his classical model of the
electron3, and it is noteworthy that he was also led to speculate that this 4-velocity
ﬁeld described the motion of a real, physical, ‘aether’4. The form of the charge 4-
velocity in terms of the continuum 4-velocity now follows directly from (16).

(cid:19)

Besides the mass M which is determined by initial conditions, each of the terms
in (15) may be written in terms of the 4-velocities uµ
−. From the deﬁnitions
of F µν, J µ, Q and V µ, we ﬁnd that the Lorentz force equation (15) translates into
a complicated third order partial diﬀerential equation constraining the 4-velocities.
The conservation of mass follows from the continuity equation for mass density,

+ and uµ

(MV µ),µ = 0 ,
which is ensured if the ﬂow of mass density follows the ﬂow of charge density. We
will see later that the Lorentz force equation follows from the ﬂuid dynamical in-
teractions between sources and sinks, and this will complete our picture of classical
electrodynamics in this gauge.

(18)

3.2. The Consistency of the Continuum Gauge

We have identiﬁed the components Aµ

+ and Aµ

− of the 4-potential with the 4-

+ and uµ

velocities uµ
− of the continuum satisfying the conditions (10) and (11), and
have referred to this gauge choice as the ‘continuum gauge’. It is not obvious that this
gauge choice can be applied consistently to all electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations, so
we demonstrate its consistency here, and give explicit solutions for the point charge
and the plane electromagnetic wave.

In order to prove consistency, it is necessary to ﬁnd a decomposition of the 4-
potential as the diﬀerence of two 4-velocity ﬁelds satisfying equations (10) and (11)
simultaneously. Using the notation of (3), we therefore need to ﬁnd, given any 4-
potential Aµ = (φ, A) deﬁned up to a gauge transformation Aµ
Aµ + ∂µψ, two
3-velocity ﬁelds v+ and v− satisfying the following conditions,

The second of these equations is a simple geometrical vector identity, and it is
clear that any solution set for (γ+v+, γ−v−) will form a surface of revolution about
the axis deﬁned by A. To ﬁnd the solution surface explicitly for a given (φ, A), it
is convenient to take the origin to lie at A/2k, and to use polar coordinates (r, θ) in
any plane containing A, where r

[0, π] is the angle made with respect to the direction of A. Note the following

It is always possible to choose the function ψ deﬁning the choice of gauge in such
a way that φ = 0 everywhere5. Since solutions to (19) always exist in this case, this
proves that the continuum gauge is indeed a consistent one.

±

It is important to note that there is actually a signiﬁcant additional degree of
freedom inherent in the way the decomposition of Aµ is made into 4-velocity ﬁelds,
which goes beyond the standard gauge freedom. First of all, for each electromagnetic
conﬁguration there will be a continuum of gauge choices for which a continuum gauge
solution set exists. Secondly, for any particular choice of gauge for which a solution
does exist, there will in general be an entire two-parameter surface of possible solutions
for v+ and v− at each point in space. We will show later that these velocity vector
ﬁelds correspond to the motion of massive discrete particles, so that this freedom may
have a real physical signiﬁcance as a possible classical source of dark matter.

3.3. The Point Charge

Let us now ﬁnd the vacuum conﬁguration which describes a positive charge q

positioned at the origin. The corresponding electromagnetic ﬁelds are given by,

3.4. The Plane Electromagnetic Wave

While in principle one can claim that all electromagnetic conﬁgurations ultimately
originate from the presence of charges, there do exist nontrivial conﬁgurations in
which no charges are present, the most obvious and important example being that of
the electromagnetic wave. It is therefore important, both for this reason and from a
historical perspective, to show explicitly how plane waves arise in the present context
from the motion of the relativistic continuum. We turn to this problem now.

Let us consider a plane electromagnetic wave with wave-vector κ travelling in
the x-direction with the E-ﬁeld plane-polarised in the y-direction. The 4-potential
describing this plane wave is,

We therefore seek solutions of the form,

Applying (10) and equating with (32) we obtain the two conditions,

Ignoring equal velocity motions of the ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ continua which
have already been shown to have no electromagnetic consequences, these conditions
allow us to restrict our attention to solutions of the form,

and we have deﬁned A = Ay cos(ωt

continuum and the negative continuum here are equal in magnitude and opposite in
direction, so that there is no net charge, with the motion of both being parallel to the
π/2 radians out of phase respectively. It also follows from (36) that
electric ﬁeld but
the velocity of the continuum can never exceed the speed of light, irrespective of the
intensity of the plane wave. Substituting (36) into (34) the motion of the continuum
is given by,

(37)
These equations clearly show that the propagation of a plane electromagnetic
wave is described by the oscillation of the medium in the direction of the electric
ﬁeld - the positive continuum oscillates π/2 out of phase with E while the negative
continuum oscillates with the same magnitude and precisely the opposite phase. Thus
the propagation of electromagnetic waves is seen to be a direct manifestation of the
oscillations of the underlying relativistic continuum.

Recall the particular gauge choice in which φ = 0 everywhere. We saw that the
simplest ‘lowest energy’ solution is given in this case by v+ =
v− = A/2k. However,
we also saw that it is possible to add, relativistically in the sense of (38), the same,
arbitrary, possibly time-dependent, 3-velocity vector ﬁeld to both v+ and v− without
changing the 4-potential. If these velocity ﬁelds have a real physical meaning then this
additional freedom will correspond to a large class of vacuum conﬁgurations which
can perhaps be interpreted in terms of the motion of an arbitrarily distributed ‘Dirac
sea’ of particles and antiparticles. This provides a means of adding energy density to
the vacuum without any observable electromagnetic eﬀects.

3.6. The Continuum as a Massive Relativistic Fluid

In this section we show that the spacetime continuum must be a relativistic ﬂuid of
massive discrete particles, and that interactions between sources and sinks give rise to
the Lorentz force equation. The fact that both Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz
force are consequences of the relativistic ﬂuid model is a strong indication that there
is more to this description than mere formalism, and that classical electrodynamics
may in reality have a ﬂuid dynamical basis.

We saw in (31) that the velocity of the continuum decreases with radius outside of
the point charge acting as its source. Had the continuum been massless, its velocity
would have been constant and equal to c everywhere. We therefore conclude that
the continuum has mass and that there is an attractive central force acting on the
continuum outside of the charge.

It is possible to derive an expression for this attractive central force. In particular,
if we assume the charged particle is centred at the origin, then the force f i acting on
an inﬁnitesimal element of the continuum at radius r must satisfy5,

f i =

where m = ρmδV is the mass of the test element assuming that it has mass density ρm
and occupies volume δV . To ﬁnd the value of dv/dt, solve (31) for r and diﬀerentiate
the resulting equation with respect to t to ﬁnd an expression for dv/dt in terms of v.
Rearranging terms and simplifying, the ﬁeld at radius r is found to have the form,

the continuum, so clearly the continuum itself cannot be charged. The mystery will

where S is a radius-independent proportionality factor. Now, the ﬂux of continuum
passing through a spherical shell at radius r is just Φ = 4πr2ρnγv (where the factor
of γ takes into account to the relativistic contraction in the radial direction). But this
is precisely the constant S in (42) which can therefore be identiﬁed as the strength
of the charged particle sink/source.

3.7. The Discrete Relativistic Fluid

We discovered in the previous subsection that there is an inverse-square law at-
traction of elements of the continuum towards the point charge. Given that the
continuum density is greater closer to the charged particle, let us investigate the
possibility that the continuum may be a continuous, compressible, medium whose
attractive self-interactions result in the observed attraction. If the attractive force
between two volume elements of the continuum is given by,

dF (r1, r2)

ρn(r1)ρn(r2)f (

) .

(43)

where f (r) is some polynomial in r, then a little calculation shows that an inverse
r−4. However, the magnitude of the
square attraction is possible only if f (r)
resultant force on any element turns out to be inﬁnitely large in this case.

∼

There are three sources of these (logarithmic) divergences - (i) the contribution
from the core of the point charge where the continuum density becomes inﬁnite,
(ii) the contribution from the continuum at inﬁnity, and (iii) the contribution from
continuum elements in the immediate neighbourhood of that element. The ﬁrst of
these can be avoided if the charges are not pointlike, the second can be avoided if
the universe is either bounded or homogeneous, and the third can be avoided by
discarding the idea that the continuum is some kind of continuous elastic medium,
but rather consists of a ﬂuid of interacting discrete particles.

We are therefore led to conclude that our relativistic continuum is a space-ﬁlling
relativistic ﬂuid and the electromagnetic 4-potential must be deﬁned in terms of the
ensemble motion of the ﬂuid as opposed to the motion of the individual discrete par-
ticles. If the instantaneous ﬂuid velocity ar xµ is ζ µ(x), then the 4-velocity appearing
in (10) is,

uµ(x) =< ζ µ > ,

(44)

where < ζ µ > indicates the time-averaged motion of the particles in the neighbour-
hood of xµ. All other electrodynamic quantities must be deﬁned as time-averages in
the same way.

Although the conﬁguration representing a charged particle is in steady state, the
ﬂuid itself remains in constant motion. Recall that the motion of an individual particle
in the co-moving frame is described by the total derivative6,

average, each particle moves as if it were charged with q/m =
c/k. This is precisely
the charge-to-mass ratio observed in the Coulomb-like attraction of (40), and so the
earlier mystery has been resolved. Because (45) is a basic identity valid for any motion
of the relativistic ﬂuid, this conclusion holds irrespective of the precise nature of the

−

interactions between the ﬂuid particles.

3.8. Coulomb’s Law and the Lorentz Force Equation

As further evidence that classical electrodynamics has relativistic ﬂuid dynamics
as its basis, we will now show that the Lorentz force equation emerges automatically
from the interaction between sources and sinks when they are not assumed to be ﬁxed
in position.

The integral momentum equation for a ﬂuid tells us that the force on a target
charged particle with charge Q′ due to a source particle of charge Q at distance r
is given by the rate of change of momentum transfer to the target by the particles
entering or leaving the source. If we suppose that the target particle has an eﬀective
radius R then, assuming spherical symmetry, it will have an eﬀective volume of 4
3πR3.
In accordance with (42), the density of ﬂuid particles encountering the target at
distance r from the source is ρn(r).
If we further assume that each ﬂuid particle
is identical with mass m, then the 3-momentum carried by each is given by mγv.
Finally, the collision rate will be determined by the strength S′ of the target. Thus
the force on the target will be given by the product of these contributions,

where he have used (42). This takes precisely the form of Coulomb’s law if we make
the following identiﬁcation,

,

Q = S

mR3

s

(47)

(48)

where the charge Q is expressed in terms of the strength of the source S, the mass
m of the ﬂuid particles and the eﬀective charge radius R. Clearly for (47) to hold,
positive charges must eﬀectively act as sinks, and negative charges as sources, or vice
versa. The validity of Coulomb’s law in turn implies the validity of the Lorentz force
equation7, as we have assumed from the outset that relativity holds. This completes
our description of classical electrodynamics.

The fact that equal velocity contributions of ﬂuid particles from the positive and
negative continua have no electromagnetic eﬀects means that the net momentum
transfer must be zero, which in turn implies that particles in the negative continuum
must have equal and opposite mass to those in the positive continuum. The reason
for the negative sign of the contribution of the antimatter ﬂuid particles to the 4-
potential is their propagation backwards in time, which leads to a change in sign of
their 4-velocities. This implies that the 4-potential Aµ is indeed the net 4-velocity of
the particle and antiparticle components of the space-ﬁlling ﬂuid. This is a radically

diﬀerent interpretation of the 4-potential from the one to which we are accustomed.

4. The Gravitational Field of a Point Mass and its Consequences

In the previous section we have succeeded in deriving the equations of classical
electrodynamics in terms of the motion of a two-component relativistic ﬂuid where
each component is essentially a time-reversed version of the other. We have not,
however, explained what the origin of these components is, and in that sense our
formulation of classical electrodynamics remains incomplete.

We will show in this section that general relativity actually predicts the existence
of the two ﬂuid components, and this will be suﬃcient to show that classical electro-
dynamics is a necessary consequence of general relativity. We leave discussion of the
other remaining mystery, namely the origin of the quantisation of charge and mass,
to a future work.

4.1. The Kruskal-Extended Schwarzschild Solution

The discussion in

3.6, and in particular equation (42) makes clear that the mass
§
density of the ﬂuid outside a pointlike charged particle tends to inﬁnity as we approach
its centre. This implies that charged particles should be classical black holes whose
spacetime metric is described by the Schwarzschild solution.

It is common knowledge that radially infalling particles in a Schwarzschild space-
time outside a pointlike mass will cross the event horizon at radius r = 2m, and then
hit the singularity at r = 0 in ﬁnite proper time. To an external observer however, it
will appear to take the particle an inﬁnite amount of time to reach the event horizon.
It is also common knowledge that there is no physical singularity (e.g. the compo-
nents of the curvature tensor are all well-behaved there) at the event horizon, and
only a coordinate singularity, which can be removed by a more appropriate choice of
coordinates.

However, it is less well-known that the so-called ‘Schwarzschild solution’ which is
derived in all modern textbooks on general relativity, was actually due to Hilbert8,
and is inequivalent to the original solution by Schwarzschild9, which had no inte-
rior solution, only an exterior one. Moreover, Hilbert’s solution contains a serious
mathematical error due to the misinterpretation of the radial parameter appearing
in the metric. This was ﬁrst noticed by Abrams10, and further clariﬁed by Antoci11
and most recently by Crothers12. Typical derivations of the ‘Schwarzschild solution’
attempt to ﬁnd the most general spherically symmetric metric of the form,

(49)

which satisﬁes the vacuum Einstein ﬁeld equations. However it is incorrect to assume
a priori, as Hilbert did, that r in (49) is a radial coordinate. Rather it need only

parametrise the radial coordinate for the solution to be spherically symmetric. The
careful analysis of the problem by Abrams shows that the event horizon at radial
parameter r = 2m coincides with the position of the point mass, so that the event
horizon appears pointlike to an external observer, and the ‘interior’ of the event
horizon corresponds to the point mass itself. The solution due to Hilbert,

ds2 =

2m
r (cid:19)
is only correct if the parameter r > 2m, and clearly r cannot then be interpreted as
a radius. The general solution for the spherically symmetric metric takes the form,

Here the radial parameter r is shifted by 2m relative to Hilbert’s solution, so that
the point particle is now at r = 0 rather than at r = 2m. Even in this case, r is not
the radial coordinate. If the true radius Rp is deﬁned as the distance from the point
mass to a point at radial parameter r, then Rp is given in this case by,

For more details of the derivation of (51) and (54) the reader is referred to
Crothers’ work12. For our purposes, it is suﬃcient to note that the event horizon
is pointlike and coincides with the position of the point mass, and that the metric
is well-behaved everywhere outside the event horizon. Clearly there is no ‘interior
solution’, so that it is both impossible and meaningless for a particle to be said to
‘cross’ the event horizon. The impenetrability of the event horizon should already
have been clear from the fact that the timelike and radial directions appear to swap
places in Hilbert’s solution as the horizon is crossed, implying a change in signature
of the metric which is not physically possible.

Despite the misinterpretation of the radial parameter in the Hilbert solution, it
remains the case that a radially infalling particle will reach the event horizon in ﬁnite
proper time, so that the Schwarzschild solution is geodesically incomplete, and the
Kruskal extension is still necessary for a complete solutionc. This is most easily seen by
following the more general derivation of Synge13, where the Kruskal-extended solution
is obtained directly from ﬁrst principles.

The question naturally arises as to what does then happen to an infalling particle
when it reaches the event horizon given that it cannot cross it? Bearing in mind that
the connection and curvature coeﬃcients are all well-behaved at the event horizon,
the only reasonable and consistent conclusion seems to be that the infalling particle
continues travelling smoothly onto the second Kruskal-extended exterior spacetime
sheet, with its proper time still increasing as before, but now in an outward radial
direction with its trajectory at least initially folding back on itself.

Recall that the second exterior sheet is superimposed on the original sheet, but
with the orientation of the time-like direction reversed, so that the Kruskal-extended
spacetime is a time-nonorientable manifold. What this means to an external observer
is that the particle now appears to be travelling radially outwards but backwards
it looks like an antiparticle travelling radially inwards and forwards in
in time, i.e.
time. The entire process therefore looks not like a single infalling particle, but like
a particle-antiparticle annihilation process occurring at the event horizon, with the
actual annihilation event occuring at time t =
. Note that the infalling particle
itself will remain blissfully unaware of how its motion appears to an external observer.
With this intepretation, the Kruskal extension does not describe a white hole
solution, but rather an antiparticle black hole solution. This description of pair anni-
hilation at the event horizon is consistent with the analysis of Hadley14 who concludes
that the failure of time-orientability of a spacetime region would be indistinguishable
from a particle-antiparticle annihilation event.

∞

In order for the above description of the black holedto be compatible with the
result of suﬃciently massive spherically symmetric gravitational collapse, it must be
the case that once a critical mass density has been achieved and the event horizon
forms, a topological phase transition occurs which completely separates the interior
of the event horizon from its exterior. As we have shown above, the interior of
the black hole appears pointlike from the point of view of an external observer as
a result of this transition, yet internally it can have a ﬁnite volume, continuing to
evolve as a self-contained, massive self-gravitating system in its own right. Clearly
the classical black hole can have complex internal structure even though it appears
pointlike to the outside world. Given that the exterior of the black hole becomes

cNote that Abrams et al. unfortunately ‘throw the baby out with the bathwater’ by rejecting the
validity of the Kruskal extension.
dThroughout this paper, ‘black holes’ should be considered to be ECOs or ‘eternally collapsing
objects’15 as they take an inﬁnite amount of time to form according to an external observer.

a time-nonorientable manifold, it is natural to expect that the interior space must
also be time-nonorientable, and that the overall orientation is conserved by the phase
transition. The divergence of an invariant, local, intrinsic quantity with a simple
physical interpretation when it is calculated at a position closer and closer to the event
horizon, namely the norm of the 4-acceleration of a test particle whose worldline is the
unique orbit of absolute rest deﬁned, through a given event, by the unique timelike,
hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector, clearly indicates the presence of a physical
singularity upon formation of the event horizon16.

Now Hadley17 has shown that geon-like elementary particles in classical gen-
eral relativity, of which our charged particles are particular examples, will naturally
have the transformation properties of a spinor if the spacetime manifold is not time-
orientable. We know that they appear to an external observer to be pointlike, and
that they are stable as the event horizon is impenetrable. We can therefore conclude
that classical black holes, which according to our analysis look like pinched Einstein-
Rosen bridges18 connecting the two spacetime sheets, have all the properties of stable
pointlike spinors. Conversely, it is natural to propose that the elementary fermions
observed in nature are gravitational solitons corresponding to stable topological con-
ﬁgurations of classical black holes.

For the sake of convenience, in the sections that follow we will refer to the particles
and antiparticles annihilating at the event horizon of a point charge as ‘plancktons’
and ‘antiplancktons’ respectively, and refer to the two exterior Kruskal spacetime
sheets as the ‘base sheet’ and the ‘dual sheet’, where time evolves forwards on the
base sheet and backwards on the dual sheet.

4.2. Neutrinos as Gravitational Dipoles

Let us now consider the nature of the ﬂuid particles in more detail. Recall that
the 4-momentum pµ of particles on the dual spacetime sheet will have a reversed time
signature relative to those of particles on the original sheet,

pµ
+ = (mcγ+, mγ+v+) ,

pµ
− = (

mcγ−, mγ−v−) .

(55)

−

The particles on the dual sheet will therefore appear to be antiparticles with a negative
mass of equal magnitude. From the discussion at the end of
3.8, we also know that
§
particles and antiparticles on the same spacetime sheet must have equal and opposite
mass in order to correctly account for the sign of the Coulomb force between charges,
and to explain the net zero momentum transfer when particles and antiparticles travel
at the same position on the same sheet with equal velocitye.

eNote that while particles and antiparticles on the same spacetime sheet must have opposite mass,
the 4-momentum of a particle on one sheet will be the same as the 4-momentum of its antiparticle
on the dual sheet. This is because the time signature is eﬀectively reversed twice - once for the
matter-antimatter conjugation, and once for the swapping of the spacetime sheet.

Given their fundamental nature, the ﬂuid particles must be ground state gravi-
tational solitons formed from the collapse of intense gravitational waves, which are
themselves nothing but ripples in spacetime. It is fairly well-established that gravita-
tional waves of suﬃcient intensity can collapse to form black holes19,20, so presumably
there was enough energy in the early universe for these primordial black holes to be
formed in enormous quantities. As classical black holes, the ﬂuid particles must
have the structure of pinched Einstein-Rosen bridges and will transform as spinors.
The identiﬁcation with neutrinos seems particularly appropriate here as Einstein and
Rosen suggested the same identiﬁcation themselves in their original paper18.

We know that the ﬂuid particles are responsible, through their motion, for the
appearance of charge, and so cannot be charged themselves. The only uncharged
spinors observed in nature are the neutrinos, which do indeed ﬁll spacetime, so it is
natural to identify our ﬂuid particles and antiparticles with neutrinos and antineutri-
nos respectively. The two halves of the Einstein-Rosen bridge, one on each spacetime
sheet, will have equal and opposite mass, and can therefore be identiﬁed with the
plancktons and antiplancktons which annihilate each other at the event horizons of
charged particles.

The neutrino therefore has the structure of a gravitational dipole consisting of a
bound state of a planckton and an antiplanckton, and the planckton-antiplanckton
pair annihilation process at the charged particle event horizon actually corresponds
to the annihilation of neutrinos and antineutrinos there. The neutrino then has the
curious interpretation of being a bound state of a planckton moving forwards in time
with the same planckton moving backwards in time having bounced oﬀ the event
horizon of a black hole.

For our picture of the neutrino to be consistent with (10), the planckton in the
base sheet and the antiplanckton in the dual sheet constituting the neutrino must
contribute to the 4-potential with the same (positive) sign. Conversely, the base
sheet antiplanckton and the dual sheet planckton constituting the antineutrino must
both give negative sign contributions to the 4-potential. Then we may write,

Aµ = Aµ

+ + Aµ

− =

−

(56)

where ‘B’ and ‘D’ refer to the ‘base’ and ‘dual’ sheets, and ‘+’ and ‘
’ refer to matter
and antimatter, respectively. We will see in
5.4 that the signs appearing on the left
§
hand side correspond exactly to the direction of propagation in time of each of the
particle types. Since backward propagation in time by deﬁnition (3) reverses the sign
of the 0-component of the 4-velocity, strictly speaking there is in fact no need for the
negative signs in (56) if it is understood that the direction of time should be taken
to be that of the contributing ﬂuid component.

−

Because they are space-ﬁlling, the neutrinos act like ‘pegs’ holding the two Kruskal-
extended spacetime sheets together. This has physical signiﬁcance for the propagation
3.4 that the propagation of electromagnetic
of electromagnetic waves. We saw in
§

waves could be represented by the oscillations of the positive and negative momen-
tum particles out of phase. Given our discovery that spacetime is double-sheeted,
this suggests the alternative description that electromagnetic waves may be due to
oscillatory motion of the two sheets relative to each other, with the neutrinos act-
ing as the pegs holding them together. The neutrinos, then, are responsible for the
physical vacuuum acting as a ‘luminiferous aether’.

4.3. Exotic Cold Dark Matter and Modiﬁed Newtonian Dynamics

The cancellation of the contributions from the planckton and antiplanckton con-
stituting the neutrino means that an isolated neutrino would be expected to have
zero mass. However the gravitational dipole structure of the neutrino means that it
will become polarised in the presence of a gravitational ﬁeld in analogy with elec-
trodynamics, and this polarisation will be manifested by a small relative translation
of the two spacetime sheets. As a result, the neutrino will be attracted towards any
nearby massive body, irrespective of whether that body consists of matter or anti-
matter. This will give the neutrino the appearance of a small but ﬁnite mass of the
same sign as the source. In particular, in a matter-dominated region of the universe
neutrinos will appear to have a small positive mass which would be compatible with
recent observations. Despite their small apparent mass, it is natural to conjecture
that the sheer number of neutrinos which ﬁll spacetime could potentially account for
the apparent missing dark matter in the universe.

The other signiﬁcant physical consequence of the polarisability of the neutrino
is that the physical vacuum will act like a gravitational dielectric or ‘digravitic’ in
analogy with dielectrics in electrodynamics and this turns out to be the key to un-
derstanding the presence of modiﬁed Newtonian dynamics.

Indeed Blanchet1 showed in a recent paper that if there were to exist a space-
ﬁlling ‘aether’ consisting of exotic matter-antimatter dipoles (antimatter having neg-
ative mass), then this would successfully explain the existence of MOND as a simple
gravitational polarisation eﬀect.

Clearly our model of the physical vacuum ﬁts this description perfectly, with
the neutrinos playing the role of the exotic matter which Blanchet describes. The
implication of Blanchet’s results is that our model, which itself is based purely on
Einstein’s general theory of relativity, actually predicts the existence of modiﬁed
Newtonian dynamics.

To show how this works, following Blanchet1, let us denote the gravitational po-

tential by U. Then the gravitation ﬁeld g associated with it is,

∇
Let the spatial vector d denote the separation between the planckton and an-
tiplanckton in the (anti)neutrino, which will vary with the strength of the gravita-

(57)

tional ﬁeld. Then the dipole moment associated with each (anti)neutrino is,

If the number density of dipoles is n, then the gravitational polarisation P will be,

p = md .

P = np .

The planckton, having positive gravitational mass (we assume that all particles
have positive inertial mass) will always be attracted by an external mass distribu-
tion consisting of ordinary matter, while the antiplanckton will be repelled. The
orientation of the dipole will then be such that the dipole moment p, and hence the
polarisation P points in the direction of the gravitational ﬁeld g.

The MOND equation in the form derivable from a non-relativistic Lagrangian is,

In the case of gravitation, we can write the Milgrom function µ(g/a0) as,

µ = 1 + χ ,

This tells us that the motion of the dipole is governed not by the strength of
the gravitational ﬁeld, but by its gradient, namely the tidal gravitational ﬁeld. This
means that the dipole will remain stationary in a constant gravitational ﬁeld, and
in a gravitational ﬁeld outside a spherical massive body with potential U
1/r,
the dipole’s acceleration will be of the order of 1/r3 instead of the usual 1/r2 for
an ordinary particle. Clearly the neutrinos seem to violate the equivalence principle,
having an inertial mass of 2m and a gravitational mass of zero, and as such are good
candidates for cold dark matter.

∼

The question remains as to how the the dipole separation d varies with the ﬁeld
strength g. Unlike Blanchet, we have no need to postulate a new internal force of
non-gravitational origin, as we are well aware that what physically is happening when
a neutrino is polarised is an attempt to separate the two Kruskal extended solutions of
a classical black hole. Small perturbations can be expected to follow a linear Hooke’s
law pattern, as evidenced by the quasiharmonic motion describing the propagation
of electromagnetic waves derived in (36), which represents a very similar physical
process. However there would be expected to be an asymptotic value beyond which
the two halves can no longer be stretched, and so a reasonable parametric form for
the dipole separation may be as follows,

(70)

(71)

(72)

where d0 is the dipole separation at saturation in the strong ﬁeld limit, and the
Hooke’s law ‘spring constant’ is given by αd0. From (64) and (70) the gravitational
susceptibility χ would then take the form,

It seems unlikely that the true dependence of the dipole separation on the grav-

likely to have limited physical consequences. The essential features that need to be
present are that d′(g)/g in the zero ﬁeld limit agrees with observations, and that
d/g

0 in the strong ﬁeld limit.

The physical picture we then have is as follows. When there is no gravitational ﬁeld
there is no polarisation, while at small but ﬁnite gravitational ﬁelds, the polarisation
of the vacuum increases linearly with ﬁeld strength, corresponding to the MOND
regime. As the ﬁeld strength increases further, the polarisation becomes saturated,
reaching an asymptotic value, so that eventually the eﬀects of vacuum polarisation
become negligible in comparison with the external ﬁeld and we return to the usual
Newtonian regime. What is perhaps most remarkable is that all of this appears
to be a nontrivial consequence of classical general relativity without modiﬁcation
and without needing to introduce any new particles not already observed in nature.
Indeed it appears that neutrinos and antineutrinos themselves can be identiﬁed as
the ‘missing’ cold dark matter.

5. Antigravity and its Cosmological Consequences

The possibility of negative mass in the context of general relativity was ﬁrst dis-
cussed by Bondi21. The article by Nieto and Goldman22 reviews theoretical arguments
against the existence of antigravity. Nevertheless there has been a renewed interest
in the possibility of antigravity23,24 on account of recent cosmological observations,

including proposals for experimental veriﬁcation25. Moreover, antiparticles are pre-
dicted to have negative mass by the Dirac equation in relativistic quantum theory,
which seems in itself to be suﬃcient reason to take the idea seriously.

We have shown here that antigravity must exist even in the classical realm with-
out invoking quantum mechanics, and that classical electrodynamics emerges directly
from general relativity as a result. The presence of antigravity naturally has conse-
quences for some of the major outstanding issues in cosmology, and we very brieﬂy
discuss these here. Some of these arguments have already been put forward by others
in diﬀerent contexts.

5.1. Matter Dominated Regions and the Accelerating Expansion of the Universe

Perhaps the simplest consequence of antigravity is that matter will tend to clump
together with matter and antimatter will tend to clump together with antimatter, but
the two types of matter will repel. If we assume that there are comparable amounts
of both matter and antimatter in the universe, the result will be region(s) of space
which are matter dominated, and other region(s) which are antimatter dominated.
In particular we appear to live in a matter-dominated region of the universe.

The repulsion between matter and antimatter dominated regions should in princi-
ple be observable, and indeed in the case of an open universe it would predict that the
universe should expand at an accelerating rate, as is observed. This was mentioned
by both Ripalda26 and Ni24. Ni goes on to suggest that the supernovae observed to
undergo acceleration may do so because they consist of antimatter and there is a
repulsive force exerted upon them by inner galaxies consisting mainly of matter. He
also proposes that increasing antimatter domination is responsible for the increasing
rate of star formation at increasingly remote distances.

On the other hand it is a curious coincidence that the observed size of the universe
is very close to the size that would be expected for a black hole of the same mass.
If the observable universe is indeed enclosed within a non-traversable event horizon,
or is otherwise bounded, then the result of antigravity would be a universe which
undergoes cycles of expansion and contraction27. If that is the case, then clearly we
are in an accelerated expansion phase following an earlier deceleration, and this would
agree with cosmological observations28.

5.2. Gamma Ray Bursts

If matter and antimatter dominated regions do exist as antigravity would predict,
then wherever the boundaries between the matter and antimatter dominated regions
meet there will be some ‘rubbing together’ of the two, resulting in massive particle-
antiparticle annihilation events which will give oﬀ huge bursts of electromagnetic
radiation. This ‘cosmic lightning’ would be observed as gamma ray bursts. This

explanation for the origin of gamma ray bursts has also been suggested by Ripalda26.
Ni24 further argues that the Earth is actually near the centre of a matter-dominated
region based upon the observed isotropic distribution of gamma ray bursts.

5.3. The Cosmological Constant and Spacetime Curvature

Einstein’s general theory of relativity allows for the presence of a cosmological
constant, but the value observed for Λ is over 120 orders of magnitude smaller than
that predicted from quantum vacuum eﬀects. The tiny value observed for the cos-
mological constant can be explained at a fundamental level if the simplest particle
building blocks (i.e the plancktons and antiplancktons), which form the basis of all
other particles, have the property that particles on the dual sheet have opposite en-
ergy to those on the base sheet. Because these particles always occur in pairs, their
contribution to the vacuum energy will cancel, resulting in no net contribution to the
cosmological constant. The small value of the cosmological constant could then be
attributed to asymmetries between the base sheet and its dual, which in the context
of our model can only be attributed to the presence of excess gravitational waves on
the base sheet, namely those which do not collapse to form black holes. Quiros29
has also suggested that there may exist two vacua, one gravitating and one antigrav-
itating resulting in the mutual cancellation of their contributions to the cosmological
constant. Alternatively, Moﬀat30 and Padmanabhan31 propose that ﬂuctuations of
vacuum energy density may be responsible for the observed cosmological constant.

The universe appears to be approximately ﬂat with only a small positive curvature
on cosmic scales. If energy is associated with curvature, then the same considerations
above would explain the relative ﬂatness of the universe, with the uncollapsed gravi-
tational waves accounting for any small positive curvature that remains.

5.4. The Relationship Between Energy, Mass and Curvature

Our model predicts that there should be two superimposed spacetime sheets -
the ‘base’ sheet, and the dual ‘sheet’. In the dual sheet, time goes in the opposite
direction relative to the base sheet, so that an observer on the base sheet will observe
a particle on the dual sheet to be travelling backwards in time. There must also be
both particles and antiparticles on the same sheet, with the antiparticles travelling
in the opposite direction in time to the particles.

However all of these identiﬁcations are relative to the particular frame of reference
used, and diﬀerent observers will in general disagree about what constitutes matter
or antimatter and which sheet is the base sheet and which is its dual. Let us select
one particular observer arbitrarily in order to establish a convention. According to
that observer, there are four types of matter in existence, namely, matter on the base
sheet (B+), antimatter on the base sheet (B−), matter on the dual sheet (D+), and

antimatter on the dual sheet (D−).

Now, in addition to (a) the direction of propagation in time, there is associated
with all of these types of matter, (b) a gravitational mass, (c) an inertial mass, (d)
an energy, and (e) an apparent curvature of the surrounding spacetime. We would
like to ﬁnd out the sign of each of these ﬁve parameters for each of the four matter
types in the context of our model. Based upon known observations we can come to
the following conclusions:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

To account for Coulomb’s law in electrodynamics, it must be the case that
particles and antiparticles on the same sheet have opposite gravitational mass.
3.8.
This has already been discussed in
§

To account for the zero mass of isolated neutrinos, which have a dipole struc-
ture, as well as for the existence of modiﬁed Newtonian dynamics, which is a
consequence of gravitational polarisation of neutrinos, matter in the base sheet
must have opposite gravitational mass to antimatter in the dual sheet.

Because we live in a matter dominated part of the universe, and also indirectly
from the observation that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate,
matter and antimatter in the same sheet must repel. This, together with their
known sign of gravitational mass implies that the inertial mass of all particle
types is positive.

Because matter attracts matter and antimatter attracts antimatter, both of
these must be associated with positive curvature in the same spacetime sheet
as the observer.

The near ﬂatness of spacetime means that the total curvature is close to zero.
This means that the curvature associated with matter and antimatter on the
dual sheet must be negative and cancel the curvature due to matter and anti-
matter on the base sheet.

Energy is released when matter and antimatter annihilates, so conservation of
energy requires that matter and antimatter on the same sheet have the same
sign of energy.

The tiny value of the cosmological constant implies that the total energy of the
vacuum must be very small, so that the energy of both matter and antimatter
in the dual sheet must be negative. This does not imply any violations in energy
conservation as particles and antiparticles in the base sheet only annihilate with
antiparticles and particles respectively in the dual sheet at the event horizon of
the black hole, and this only happens after an inﬁnite amount of time according
to an external observer, so that no observer will ever actually be present to
observe the nonconservation of energy when it does occur at t =

.

Putting all this information together, we ﬁnally arrive at the following table:

Particle type
Direction of time

This is very enlightening indeed. Comparing with (56) we see that the sign of
the contribution of each particle type to the electromagnetic 4-potential coincides
with the direction of propagation in time of each particle. Now, since there is no
preferred direction in space, all observers can agree on a choice of coordinates for the
spatial direction, but will in general diﬀer in their measurement of the direction of
time by precisely this sign factor. This allows us to interpret the 4-potential as the
sum of the contributions of the 4-velocities of each of the four matter types using the
direction of time which each matter type experiencesf, which would be in accordance
with the deﬁnition of the 4-velocity given in (3). Then the main equation (10) for
the 4-potential should be rewritten as,

Aµ = uµ

B+ + uµ

B− + uµ

D+ + uµ

D− ,

(74)

where we have removed the dimensional constant and identiﬁed Aµ as a 4-velocity
once and for all, so that all the physical quantities we have deﬁned in our model
can be expressed solely in terms of length and time. Recall that (uB+, uD−) and
(uB−, uD+) represent the velocities of the opposite ends of neutrino and antineutrino
dipoles respectively, and so to a very good approximation uB+ = uD− and uB− = uD+.
We also see that energy is associated with spacetime curvature, and that neither
of these are equivalent to either gravitational or inertial mass. Furthermore, we see
that the principle of equivalence does not strictly hold for antimatter, as these have
opposite (as opposed to equal) inertial and gravitational masses, requiring that the
principle be generalised to describe antimatter correctly. The same conclusion was
reached by Hossenfelder27. Because observations are made from the perspective of an
observer on the base sheet, the equation E = mc2 remains correct so long as we bear
in mind that we are talking about inertial mass and not gravitational mass.

5.5. A Big Bang or a Big Collapse?

As indicated above, whereas there is no preferred direction in space, there is
certainly a preferred direction in time. Fundamentally, this can be put down to

fFor example, a particle on the dual sheet travelling in the positive x direction will be measured to
have a negative velocity as it is also travelling backwards in time.

the fact that, in gravitation, the formation of the event horizon corresponds to an
irreversible topological phase transition separating the interior from the exterior which
can no longer interact as a result. This allows us to deﬁne the forward direction in
time as the direction in which matter collapses to form classical black holes.
In
particular as time passes, the distribution of energy will become decreasingly uniform
as more matter collapses towards the event horizons of black holes, from a possibly
uniform distribution in the distant past.

If such a picture is correct, then the standard big bang scenario must be incor-
rect. Rather, in the early universe the vacuum will have been a state with a relatively
uniform energy distribution of gravitational waves which collapsed to form a multi-
tude of hierarchies of classical black holes, of which presumably our entire observable
universe is just one.

The existence of a small cosmological constant suggests that the evolution may
have been initiated by the injection of energy into just the base spacetime sheet, with
the additional sheet coming into being as a result of gravitational collapse sending
infalling particles into the Kruskal extended dual sheet. Because matter in the dual
sheet propagates backwards in time, it appears to observers on the base sheet that
the dual sheet has always existed.

Bearing in mind that matter within a black hole can continue to collapse to
produce further black holes, and that each of these black holes looks pointlike to an
external observer, the possibility arises that our entire universe could be a mere speck
in a vast, perhaps even inﬁnite, ocean.

6. Discussion and Summary

We began with the simplest possible description of the physical vacuum as a
relativistic ﬂuid in motion. Along the way, we corrected a critical misinterpretation
of the radial parameter in the Schwarzschild metric outside a massive point charge.
As a result we have been able to predict as consequences of general relativity the
whole of classical electrodynamics, the identiﬁcation of neutrinos as cold dark matter,
the presence of modiﬁed Newtonian dynamics, and the existence of antigravity. We
have also suggested how the existence of antigravity might help us to understand the
accelerating expansion of the universe, the origin of gamma ray bursts, the smallness
of the cosmological constant, the relationship between mass, energy and curvature,
and have even suggested that the universe was formed from a ‘big collapse’ rather
than a ‘big bang’. It should be evident from the above list that Einstein’s general
theory of relativity has a great deal to say about current issues in cosmology.

The present discussion has concentrated mainly on cosmological consequences
of general relativity, and we leave open the many questions which remain about its
microscopic implications. Amongst these are questions such as, what exactly are mass
and charge and why are they quantised? Why is electromagnetic radiation quantised

into photons? What is the topological structure of the elementary particles, such
as the neutrinos? Could classical black holes be responsible for quark conﬁnement
and the success of the nucleon quark bag model? Can the standard model gauge
group be derived as a consequence of spacetime being double-sheeted? Why are there
exactly three fermion families? Can a connection be made with stochastic quantum
If so, how can quantum entanglement and wavefunction collapse be
mechanics?
explained? Can such a description be extended to relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory
and perhaps explain the origin of the fundamental forces of the standard model? Is
it possible that general relativity itself is the theory of everything? If so, is it an
emergent theory, or is it a fundamental theory in its own right? Ideally we will be
able to address at least a few of these questions in the sequel.

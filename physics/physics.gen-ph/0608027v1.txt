An eﬀective angular momentum quantization condition of the form mvr = n~(m/mF ) is used to
obtain a Bohr-like model of Hydrogen-type atoms and a modiﬁed Schr¨odinger equation. Newton’s
constant, G, of Gravitation gets explicitly involved through the fundamental mass mF as deﬁned in
the sequel. This non-relativistic formalism may be looked upon as a “testing ground” for the more
general synthesis of the gravity and the quantum.

One of the pivotal principles of physical nature
underlying mathematical methods of the quantum
theory can be said to be the following.

Quantization of a physical quantity is, at a very
basic level, expressing that physical quantity as an
integral multiple of “some unit” of that quantity,
that unit being obtainable from the fundamental
constants of Nature alone. This principle based
on the dimensional analysis has a crucial role in
not only the orthodox quantum theory but also in
subsequent developments in Physics.

As is well known, Niels Bohr, in a masterly use
of this principle, had postulated the quantization
rule for the angular momentum of an electron (of
mass me and charge e) orbiting an atomic nucleus
(of atomic number Z) in his famous model of the
hydrogen atom as [1]:

mevnrn = n~

to express the angular momentum as an integer,
n, multiple of Planck’s constant, ~, a fundamental
constant. As is also well known, having imposed
this condition, the wave number of a photon that
is emitted by the atom transiting from a state n2
to a state n1 (n2 > n1) is given by

1
λ

= Z 2R

2 (cid:21)

where R = e4me/2~2c (c being the speed of light in
vacuum) is the Rydberg constant, which now gets
determined completely in terms of the fundamental
constants of Nature.

The force of gravity between an atomic nucleus
and an electron is about 10−42 times weaker than
their electrostatic force of attraction. Still, it does
seem somewhat unsatisfactory that Bohr’s model

does not incorporate basic constants other than
Planck’s constant,
like Newton’s constant G of
gravitation, a fundamental constant.

If gravity and the quantum nature of the physi-
cal phenomena are to result from only a single the-
ory, then it seems plausible that we will have some
limited formulation of the quantum theory and,
hence, of Bohr-like model of the atom in which
G would also appear along with ~ and other fun-
damental constants of Nature. However, no such
formulation is currently available.

Perhaps, this lacuna can be remedied by using a
“unit” for the angular momentum diﬀerent than ~
that was used by Bohr. Needless to say, but we still
wish to emphasize at this place that, any new unit
of the angular momentum must be constructible
out of the basic constants.

In this paper, we show that this can indeed be
done. We also provide a Schr¨odinger-like equation
for the formulation of corresponding ideas. Just
as Bohr’s model provided the testing ground for
developments in the orthodox quantum theory, the
proposed Bohr-like model may be a testing ground
for the general synthesis (eg, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) of the
gravity and the quantum.

To begin with, we note that using c, h, G, me
and e, we can form a quantity that has the dimen-
sions of the angular momentum as:

AP = e2 me r

G
c3h

≈ 4.05 × 10

−53 cgs units. (1)

It is however very tiny. Notably, Planck’s constant
~ is 2.61 × 1025 times larger than it.

Therefore, to be able to express the “usual” an-
gular momentum of an atomic electron in terms of
AP , we “scale” this tiny unit by a factor Υ and
express Bohr’s condition of the quantization of the
angular momentum as

∗Electronic address: cirinag˙ngp@sancharnet.in
†Electronic address: jetwagh@yahoo.co.in

mevnrn = nΥAP = n Υe2 me r

G
c3h

(2)

We could strongly object to the occurrences of
e and me in (1) since these are not fundamental
constants of Nature as are G, c and h, but are
particle-speciﬁc quantities. However, we also note
that (2) is equivalent to expressing the linear mo-
mentum of an atomic electron as:

mevn =

Z
nΥ r

c3h
G

(3)

where the square-root is related to Planck’s length
Lp =

hG/c3 by h/Lp.

p

Evidently, e and me do not at all play any role
in condition (3). Essentially, the quantization con-
dition for one physical quantity implies the quan-
tization of another related physical quantity with
the proportionality factors of one aﬀecting those of
the other [12].

In (3), we have chosen proportionality constants
to “match” the formulas of the present study with
those of the “usual” atomic physics. Thus, the
factor of Z/nΥ is “adjustable” in the condition (3),
we may then note here.

It then follows that the radius of the electronic

orbit of the atom is given by

rn =

n2Υ2
Z

e2meG
c3h

(4)

(5)

and that the wave number of a photon, which is
emitted by the atom transiting from a state n2 to
a state n1 (n2 > n1), is given by:

1
λ

=

Z 2c2
2Υ2Gme (cid:20)

1
n2
1

−

1
n2
2 (cid:21)

It now immediately follows that, for an appro-
priate value of Υ, the same atomic physics would
result even with the newly chosen unit of the an-
gular momentum.

On its face value, the above exercise appears
to be only of pure academic interest and, hence,
not useful for further progress, if the same atomic
physics as that of Bohr’s model is to result from
it. But, we would like to note that the validity of
the proposed model can be beyond that of Bohr’s
model using Planck’s constant simply because Υ is
a free parameter.

We also note that the validity condition for the

non-relativistic treatment reads:

vn/c ≪ 1 ⇒ Υ

−1 ≪

Z r

G

≈

× 5.6 × 103

which, for an electron revolving around the usual
atomic nucleus, is

vn/c ≪ 1 ⇒ Υ

× 5.1 × 10

−23

2

For comparison with Bohr’s model, we note that
the condition for non-relativistic treatment reads
(Z/n) α << 1 and that this is independent of the
mass of the particle under consideration [13]. The
ﬁrst of our inequalities, with mass, can be satisﬁed
for suitable values of m, e and Υ.

After having demonstrated the plausibility of
the Bohr-like model [14] of the atom involving the
new unit of angular momentum or, equivalently,
the new unit of momentum, we turn to aspects
related to ideas of Schr¨odinger.

Now, as is well known [1], Schr¨odinger’s equation
is obtained from E = p2/2m + V , where p is the
momentum and V is the potential, by substituting
p → −ı~∇ and E → ı~∂/∂t wherein Planck’s con-
stant ~ serves to keep the dimensions of the terms
correct. (All the “undeclared” symbols will have
their usual meaning.)

In the above spirit, we now use the “new unit”
(that has the dimensions of Planck’s constant) and
make the obvious substitutions p → −ıAP ∇ and
E → ıAP ∂/∂t in E = p2/2me + V . This leads us
to the following Schr¨odinger-like equation:

For a free particle, this equation reduces to

Notice that me drops out of the equation. The
factor Υ then essentially determines the “funda-
mental” mass, mF , as

where α = e2/c~ ≈ 1/137 is the well known ﬁne
structure constant.

With this deﬁnition, the Schr¨odinger equation

given above can be written as:

(cid:18)

2m (cid:18)

∇2Ψ + V Ψ (7)

wherein we dropped the subscript e on the mass
m, as this equation holds generally.

With the deﬁnition (6), the Bohr quantization
condition (2) then reads mevnrn = n~(me/mF ),
while the quantization condition (3) reads mevn =
(Z/n)αmF c = (Z/n)(e2mF /~).
It should then
be noticed that we only have “scaled”, by m/mF ,

Planck’s constant of the usual Schr¨odinger’s equa-
tion, and also that no new solutions are implied
here. Clearly, standard solutions of Schr¨odinger’s
equation can be used to explore the consequences
of the existence of mF in (7).

We have then obtained here, only a preliminary,
Bohr-inspired, synthesis of the gravity and the
quantum by way of the fundamental mass mF and
the Schr¨odinger equation (7) at the non-relativistic
level of its applications.

As closing remarks, one of us (SMW) would like

to comment as follows.

Evidently, we will recover, as was stated before,
the “usual” atomic physics when m = mF = me.
(In this case, Υ = (αme)−1
ch/G.) The pro-
posed preliminary synthesis of gravity with the
quantum then incorporates the usual explanations
of quantum phenomena.

p

An apparent limitation of (6) and, hence, of (7)
is that these involve charge, ie, in (6), e 6= 0. But,
this is due to the following situation.

Notice here that c3/GX 2 has the dimensions of
Planck’s constant if X has the dimensions of 1/L,
and 1/L are the dimensions of Rydberg’s constant.
Thus, no quantity of the dimensions of angular mo-
mentum, other than ~, can be constructed from G
and c without involving ~ or any particle-speciﬁc
quantities like charge and mass.

Now, momentum has the dimensions of [~]/L.
Hence, similar to the above case with the angular
momentum, no quantity having dimensions of mo-
mentum can be constructed out of G and c without
explicitly involving ~ or any particle-speciﬁc quan-
tities like charge and mass.

But, e2mF is completely determined by funda-
mental constants G, c, ~, and the electronic charge
e appears in the form of the ﬁne structure constant
only. Thus, the appearance of e in (6) is not any
serious limitation.

Then, the appearance of e in (6) rather points
at a way in which equations of a more general for-
mulation could be expected to reduce to their non-
relativistic forms. Of course, unless a satisfactory
mathematical framework is at hand for the general
synthesis of gravity and the quantum, it is diﬃcult
to elaborate on as to how this reduction of general
equations to (7) obtains.

It is however clear that we have only two pos-
sibilities in the non-relativistic domain: either the
usual Schr¨odinger equation or the equation (7). As
stated before, equation (7) is “equivalent” to the
usual Schr¨odinger’s equation, albeit with “modi-
ﬁed” Planck’s constant. The modiﬁed Planck’s
constant will arise unless of course m = mF , ie,
if Υ = (αm)−1
ch/G always. In this last case,
the onus then falls on the more general formulation
of the synthesis of the gravity with the quantum

p

3

to explain as to why an entirely arbitrary constant
Υ always has this form!

As this last possibility appears preposterous, we
look upon an equation of the form (7) as the
“proper” quantum equation of the non-relativistic
domain in that equations of a more general for-
mulation should reduce to (7). The following is
supportive of this view.

We then notice that if the fundamental mass
mF were taken to be dependent on diﬀerent pow-
ers of the ﬁne structure constant α by demand-
ing that Υ ∝ 1/αN (N - an integer), ie, if mF =
αN −1
ch/G, then we obtain a spectrum of funda-
mental mass values for the chosen value of charge
e. (Diﬀerent such powers of α may be expected to
arise in a synthesis of gravity with the quantum
more general than the present one.)

p

Another possibility is of an integral multiple of
the fundamental mass mF as a possible origin of
the mass spectrum. In this case, Υ could be chosen
to yield the right mass for one particle, say, πo-
meson. Then, the observed [7] mass spectrum of
some of the elementary particles is “explainable”
within the present formalism.

The so-obtained mass spectra should then turn
out be relevant for the mass spectrum of elemen-
tary particles [7]. We would like to note however
that the equation (7) does not provide any “expla-
nation” for the masses of elementary particles or
even the mass spectrum.

In this connection, we would like to also note
that important eﬀects of spin and other character-
istics of elementary particles are not included in
the present simple analysis. The aforementioned
mass spectrum should therefore be looked upon
only as a feature of the proposed synthesis. As
compared to the usual quantum formulation, the
equation (7) then has quite a “direct” relevance to
the non-relativistic behavior of each member of the
aforementioned mass spectrum.

Now, this synthesis of the gravity and the quan-
tum can be expected to have observable conse-
quences. In particular, interesting situations [15]
could be expected to arise when m 6= mF in (7).
We then look for “quantum” situations, eg, those
considered in [8], wherein the “eﬀective” value of
Planck’s constant could be “diﬀerent” than that
in, eg, Planck’s radiation formula.

Of some particular interest in this connection is
the phenomenon of Bloch oscillations [9, 10] of elec-
trons in a crystal. Although it has been diﬃcult
to observe Bloch oscillations in natural crystals,
recent advances in laser spectroscopy have made
it possible to observe [11] the Bloch oscillations of
ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices generated by
interfering laser beams trapping atoms.

4

For laser generated optical lattices, the Bloch
frequency is given by νB = mgλ/2h where λ is the
frequency of laser light producing the interference
that traps atoms of mass m in a uniform gravi-
tational ﬁeld of acceleration g. (This is based on
standard Schr¨odinger’s equation.) It should then
be possible to “create” situations wherein the “ef-
fective” Planck’s constant should be experimen-
tally observable conﬁrming or refuting thereby the
proposed synthesis of gravity and the quantum at
the non-relativistic level.

We would like to reemphasize that any non-
observation of the eﬀective Planck’s constant, as
implied by the present study, will be a certain the-
oretical surprise: we will have to understand then
as to why Nature has selected an arbitrary con-
stant Υ only in a particular way.

Lastly, we would like to note the following. Any
conceptual and mathematical framework of the
uniﬁcation of all the fundamental interactions will

have to necessarily incorporate all the fundamen-
tal physical constants along with particle-speciﬁc
physical variables such as mass and charge of the
particle. In suitable approximation, whose manner
is unclear at the present, we will have to recover
the equation (7) from the mathematical formalism
of the theory of uniﬁcation. This is of course sub-
ject to the aforementioned caveat that we infer the
existence of the eﬀective Planck’s constant in some
experimental situation.

Clearly, this preliminary synthesis of the grav-
ity with the quantum already has consequences
for general physical situations and for a fundamen-
tal theory of the uniﬁcation of all the physical in-
teractions, both. Although it is quite an elemen-
tary and, hence, limited formalism, its potential
implications appear to be fundamental to further
progress. It would therefore be important to ex-
perimentally establish the existence of an eﬀective
Planck’s constant as in (7).

[12] For Bohr’s model using Planck’s constant as a unit
of the angular momentum, the linear momentum
is given as mevn = Ze2me/n~ = (Z/n)αmec. Pro-
portionality factors have been adjusted to get Z/n
for the momentum in (3). It is then that the for-
mula for the wave number of emitted radiation has
the form of (5).

[13] This is what leads us to doubt the validity of the
non-relativistic treatment for “strange atoms” like
µ-meson atoms , as have been considered in many
textbooks. Our work here implies however that the
non-relativistic treatment can be applicable in cer-
tain of such cases.

[14] AHW worked out this Bohr-like model following
the suggestion of SMW of exploring the changes
to Bohr’s model with the condition (3) in the form
c3h/G with β as a dimensionless pro-
mevn = β
portionality constant.
p

[15] We propose to explore diﬀerent such observable

consequences of mF in a later work.

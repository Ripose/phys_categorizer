Abstract

Though the Planck scale is encountered in Quantum SuperString
Theory and Quantum Gravity, it is the Compton scale of elementary
particles which is encountered in the physical world. An explanation
for this is given in terms of Brownian processes and the duality rela-
tion.

1 Introduction

It is well known that in Quantum Gravity as well as in Quantum Super-
String Theory, we encounter phenomena at the Planck scale. Yet what we
encounter in the real world is, not the Planck scale, but the elementary par-
ticle Compton scale. The explanation for this is that the very high energy
Planck scale is moderated by the Uncertainty Principle. The question which
arises is, exactly how does this happen? We will now present an argument
to show how the Planck scale leads to the real world Compton scale, via
ﬂuctuations and a modiﬁcation of the Uncertainty Principle.

2 The Planck Scale

It is well known that the Planck Scale is deﬁned by

(1) deﬁnes the absolute minimum physical scale [1, 2]. Associated with (1)
is the Planck mass

There are certain interesting properties associated with (1) and (2). lP is the
Schwarzschild radius of a black hole of mass mP while tP is the evaporation
time for such a black hole via the Beckenstein radiation [3]. Interestingly
tP is also the Compton time for the Planck mass, a circumstance that is
symptomatic of the fact that at this scale, electromagnetism and gravitation
become of the same order [4]. Indeed all this ﬁts in very well with Rosen’s
analysis that such a Planck scale particle would be a mini universe [5, 6]. We
will now invoke a time varying gravitational constant

which resembles the Dirac cosmology and features in another scheme in which
(3) arises due to the ﬂuctuation in the particle number [7, 8, 9, 10, 4]. In
(3) m and l are the mass and Compton wavelength of a typical elementary
1080 is the number of elementary particles
particle like the pion while N
in the universe, √N the ﬂuctuation in particle number and T is the age of
the universe.
In this scheme wherein (3) follows from the theory, we use the fact that
given N particles, the ﬂuctuation in the particle number is of the order √N ,
as noted by Hayakawa, while a typical time interval for the ﬂuctuations is
¯h/mc2, the Compton time. We will come back to this point later. So we

have

whence on integration we get,

and we can also deduce its spatial counterpart, R = √N l, which is the
well known empirical Eddington formula. It is also possible to then deduce

the Hubble Law and a hitherto mysterious empirical relationship, noted by
Weinberg, between the mass of the pion and the Hubble constant (Cf.refs.
for details).
Equation (3) which is an order of magnitude relation is consistent with ob-
servation [11] while it may be remarked that the Dirac cosmology itself has
inconsistencies.
Substitution of (3) in (1) yields

where t as noted is the typical Compton time of an elementary particle. We
can easily verify that (4) is consistent. It must be stressed that (4) is not
a fortuitous empirical coincidence, but rather is a result of using (3), which
again as noted, can be deduced from theory.
(4) can be rewritten as

wherein we have used (3) and n = √N.
We will now compare (5) with the well known relations, deduced earlier,

R = √Nl T = √Nt

The ﬁrst relation of (6) is the well known Eddington formula referred to
while the second relation of (6) is given also on the right side of (3). We now
observe that (6) can be seen to be the result of a Brownian Walk process, l, t
being typical intervals between ”steps” (Cf.[4, 12, 13]). We demonstrate this
below after equation (8). On the other hand, the typical intervals l, t can be
seen to result from a Nelsonian process themselves. Let us consider Nelson’s
relation,

(∆x)2

l2 =

¯h

≡

∆t

(Cf.[14, 15, 16, 17, 12]).
Indeed as l is the Compton wavelength, (7) can be rewritten as the Quantum
Mechanical Uncertainty Principle

at the Compton scale (Cf. also [18]) (or even at the de Broglie scale).
What (7) shows is that a Brownian-Nelsonian process deﬁnes the Compton
scale while (6) shows that a Random Walk process with the Compton scale as
the interval deﬁnes the length and time scales of the universe itself (Cf.[13]).
Returning now to (5), on using (2), we observe that in complete analogy with
(7) we have the relation

(∆x)2

P =

¯h

tP ≡

¯h

∆t

We can now argue that the Nelsonian-Brownian process (8) deﬁnes the Planck
length while a Brownian Random Walk process with the Planck scale as the
interval leads to (5), that is the Compton scale.
To see all this in greater detail, it may be observed that equation (8) (without
subscripts)

(∆x)2 =

¯h
m

∆t

is the same as the Nelsonian equation, indicative of a double Weiner process.
Indeed as noted by several scholars, this deﬁnes the fractal Quantum path
of dimension 2 (rather than dimension 1) (Cf.e.g. ref.[15]).
Firstly it must be pointed out that equation (9) deﬁnes a minimum space
time unit - the Compton scale (l, t). This follows from (9) if we substitute
∆t imax = c. If the mass of the particle is the Planck mass, then this
into it
Compton scale becomes the Planck scale.
Let us now consider the distance traversed by a particle with the speed of
light through the time interval T . The distance R covered would be

∆x

dx = R = c

dt = cT

by conventional reasoning. In view of the Nelsonian equation (9), however
we would have to consider ﬁrstly, the minimum time interval t (Compton or
Planck time), so that we have

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

Secondly, because the square of the space interval ∆x (rather than the inter-
val ∆x itself as in conventional theory) appears in (9), the left side of (10)

becomes, on using (11)

Whence for the linear dimension R we would have

dx2

Z

(√ndx)(√ndy)

√nR = nct

or R = √nl

Equation (12) brings out precisely the fractal dimension D = 2 of the Brow-
nian path while (13) is identical to (4) or (6) (depending on whether we
are dealing with minimum intervals of the Planck scale or Compton scale
of elementary particles). Apart from showing the Brownian character link-
ing equations (4) and (9), incidentally, this also provides the justiﬁcation for
what has so far been considered to be a mysterious large number coincidences
viz. the Eddington formula (6).
There is another way of looking at this. It is well known that in Quantum Su-
perString Theory, at the Planck scale we have a non commutative geometry
[19, 20]

[x, y]

≈

0(l2

P ), [x, px] = ¯h[1 + 0(l2

P )]etc.

Indeed (14) follows without recourse to Quantum SuperStrings, merely by
the fact that lP , tP are the absolute minimum space time intervals as shown
a long time ago by Snyder [21].
The non commutative geometry (14), as is known is symptomatic of a mod-
iﬁed uncertainty principle at this scale [22]-[28]

∆x

≈

¯h
∆p

+ l2
P

∆p
¯h

The relation (15) would be true even in Quantum Gravity. The extra or
second term on the right side of (15) expresses the well known duality eﬀect
- as we attempt to go down to the Planck scale, infact we are lead to the
larger scale represented by it. The question is, what is this larger scale?
If we now use the fact that √n is the ﬂuctuation in the number of Planck
particles (exactly as sqrtN was the ﬂuctuation in the particle number as in
(3) so that √nmpc = ∆p is the ﬂuctuation or uncertainty in the momentum
for the second term on the right side of (15), we obtain for the uncertainty
in length,

∆x = l2
P

√nmP c
¯h

= lP √n,

We can easily see that (16) is the same as the ﬁrst relation of (5). The second
relation of (5) follows from an application of the time analogue of (15).
Thus the impossibility of going down to the Planck scale because of (14) or
(15), manifests itself in the fact that as we attempt to go down to the Planck
scale, we infact end up at the Compton scale.
Interestingly while at the Planck length, we have a left time of the order of
the Planck time, as noted above it is possible to argue on the other hand that
with the pion mass and length of a typical elementary particle like the pion,
at the Compton scale, we have a life time which is the age of the universe
itself as shown by Sivaram [3, 29].
Interestingly also Ng and Van Dam deduce the relations like [30]

δL

≤

(Ll2

P )1/3, δT

(T t2

P )1/3

≤

(17)

where the left side represents the uncertainty in the measurement of length
and time for an interval L, T . We would like to point out that if in (17) we
use for L, T , the size and age of the universe, then ∆L and ∆T reduce to the
Compton scale l, t.
In conclusion, Brownian-Nelsonian processes and the modiﬁcation of the Un-
certainity Principle at the Planck scale lead to the physical Compton scale.

The speed-gradient variational principle (SG-principle) is formulated and applied to thermody-
namical systems. It is shown that Prigogine’s principle of minimum entropy production and On-
sager’s symmetry relations can be interpreted in terms of the SG-principle and, therefore, are equiv-
alent to each other. In both cases entropy of the system plays a role of the goal functional. The
speed-gradient formulation of thermodynamic principles provide their extended versions, describ-
ing transient dynamics of nonstationary systems far from equilibrium. As an example a model of
transient (relaxation) dynamics for maximum entropy principle is derived.

INTRODUCTION

[1, 2, 3].

The equations of motion for physical systems are of-
ten derived from variational principles: principle of least
action, maximum entropy principle, etc.
In
thermodynamics two of such principles have become well
known during last century: Prigogine’s principle of min-
imum entropy production and Onsager’s symmetry prin-
ciple for kinetic coeﬃcients. Authors of both results were
awarded with Nobel prizes. Variational principles are
based on speciﬁcation of a functional (usually, integral
functional) and determination of real motions as points
in an appropriate functional space providing extrema of
the speciﬁed functional.

In addition to integral principles, diﬀerential (local)
ones were proposed: Gauss principle of least constraint,
principle of minimum energy dissipation and others. It
has been pointed out by M. Planck [4] that the local
principles have some preference with respect to integral
ones because they do not ﬁx dependence of the current
states and motions of the system on its later states and
motions. In [5, 6, 7] a new local evolution principle, so
called speed-gradient (SG) principle originated from
the SG-design principle of nonlinear control theory [5, 8]
was proposed and illustrated by a number of examples
from mechanics. In [9] SG-principle was extended to the
case of systems with constraints.

This paper is devoted to application of the SG-
principle to thermodynamics. First, the formulation of
the SG-principle is recalled. Then it is shown that Pri-
gogine’s and Onsager’s principles can be interpreted in
terms of the SG-principle and, therefore, are equivalent
to each other. In both cases entropy of the system plays
a role of the goal functional. The speed-gradient for-
mulation of thermodynamic principles provide their ex-
tended versions, suitable for the systems far from equi-

librium. Moreover, it may describe their nonstationary,
transient dynamics. In the paper SG-principle is applied
to derivation of transient (relaxation) dynamics for a sys-
tem driven by maximum entropy principle.

II. SPEED-GRADIENT VARIATIONAL
PRINCIPLE

Consider a class of physical systems described by sys-

tems of diﬀerential equations

˙x = f (x, u, t),

(1)

where x is n-dimensional vector of the system state, u
˙x =
is m-dimensional vector of free (input) variables,
dx/dt, t ≥ 0. The problem of modelling system dynamics
can be posed as the search of a law of changing u(t) in or-
der to meet some criterion of “natural”, or “reasonable”
behavior of the system. Let such a behavior be speciﬁed
as a tendency to achieve a goal, speciﬁed as decreasing
the value of the goal functional Q(x), where Q(x) is given
apriori. The ﬁrst step of the speed-gradient procedure is
to calculate the speed ˙Q = dQ
∂x f (x, u, t). The
second step is to evaluate the gradient of the speed ∇u ˙Q
with respect to input vector u (speed-gradient vector).
Finally the law of dynamics is formed as the feedback
law in the ﬁnite form

dt = ∂Q(x)

or in the diﬀerential form

u = −γ∇u ˙Q(x, u).

du
dt

= −γ∇u ˙Q(x, u),

(2)

(3)

where γ > 0 is a scalar or symmetric matrix gain (pos-
itivity of a matrix is understood as positive deﬁniteness
of associated quadratic form). The underlying idea of
the choices (2) or (3) is that the motion along the anti-
gradient of the speed ˙Q provides decrease of
˙Q. It may
˙Q which, in turn, yields
eventually lead to negativity of

decrease of Q. Now the speed-gradient principle can be
formulated as follows.

Speed-gradient principle: Among all possible mo-
tions of the system only those are realized for which the
input variables change proportionally to the speed gradi-
ent ∇u ˙Q(x, u) of an appropriate goal functional Q(x). If
there are constraints imposed on the system motion, then
the speed-gradient vector should be projected onto the set
of admissible (compatible with constraints) directions.

According to the SG-principle, to describe a system
dynamics one needs to introduce the goal function Q(x).
The choice of Q(x) should reﬂect the tendency of natural
behavior to decrease the current value Q(x(t)). Systems
obeying the SG-principle will be called SG-systems. Be-
low only the models (1) in a special form are considered:

˙x = u,

(4)

i.e. a law of change of the state velocities is sought.

Note that the SG-direction is the direction of maxi-
˙Q(x, u, t), i.e. direction of maximum
mum growth for
production rate for Q. Respectively, the opposite di-
rection corresponds to minimum production rate for Q.
The ﬁnite form (2) may be used to describe irreversible
processes, while diﬀerential form (3) corresponds to re-
versible ones. The SG-laws with nondiagonal gain matri-
ces γ can be incorporated if a non-Euclidean metric in the
space of inputs is introduced by the matrix γ−1. The ma-
trix γ can be used to describe spatial anisotropy. Admit-
ting dependence of the matrix γ on x one can recover dy-
namics law for complex mechanical systems described by
Lagrangian or Hamiltonian formalism. The SG-principle
applies to spatially distributed systems where the state
x(t) is an element of an inﬁnite dimensional space and
allows one to model dynamics of spatial ﬁelds [5].

Consider a simple illustrating example: motion of a
particle in the potential ﬁeld. In this case the vector x =
col (x1, x2, x3) consists of coordinates x1, x2, x3 of a parti-
cle. Choose smooth Q(x) as the potential energy of a par-
ticle and derive the speed-gradient law in the diﬀerential
form. To this end, calculate the speed ˙Q = [∇xQ(x)]
u
and the speed-gradient ∇u ˙Q = ∇xQ(x). Then, choosing
diﬀerential SG-law (3) with the gain γ = m−1, where
m > 0 is a parameter, we arrive at familiar Newton’s law
˙u = −m−1∇xQ(x) or m¨x = −∇xQ(x).

III. GENERALIZED ONSAGER RELATIONS

Consider an isolated physical system whose state is
characterized by a set of variables (thermodynamic pa-
rameters) ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξn. Let xi = ξi − ξ∗
i be deviations of
the variables from their equilibrium values ξ∗
2 , . . . , ξ∗
1 , ξ∗
n.
Let the dynamics of the vector x1, x2, . . . , xn be described
by the diﬀerential equations

˙xi = ui(x1, x2, . . . , xn),

i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(5)

Linearize equations (5) near equilibrium

˙xi = −

λikxk,

i = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(6)

n

X
k=1

The Onsager’s principle [10] claims that the values λik

(kinetic coeﬃcients) satisfy the equations

λik = λki,

i, k = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(7)

In general, the Onsager principle is not valid for all sys-
tems e.g. for systems far from equilibrium. Its existing
proofs [11] require additional postulates. Below a simple
new proof is given, showing that it is valid for irreversible
speed-gradient systems without exceptions.

First of all, the classical formulation of the Onsager
principle (7) should be extended to nonlinear systems. A
natural extension is the following set of identities:

∂ui
∂xk

∂uk
∂xi

(x1, x2, . . . , xn) =

(x1, x2, . . . , xn).

(8)

Obviously, for the case when the system equations (5)
have linear form (6) the identities (8) coincide with (7).
However, since linearization is not used in the formula-
tion (8) there is a hope that the extended version of the
Onsager law holds for some nonlinear systems far from
equilibrium. The following theorem speciﬁes a class of
systems for which this hope comes true.

Theorem 1. There exists a smooth function Q(x)
such that equations (5) represent the speed-gradient law
in ﬁnite form for the goal function Q(x) if and only if
the identities (8) hold for all x1, x2, . . . , xn.

The proof of the theorem is very simple. Since (5) is
the speed-gradient law for Q(x), its right-hand sides can
be represented in the form ui = −γ ∂ ˙Q
i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
∂ui ,
˙Q = (∇xQ)T u).
Therefore ui = −γ(∂Q/∂xi) (in view of
Hence ∂ui
∂xi , and identities (8) are
valid. Finally, the condition (8) is necessary and suﬃcient
for potentiality of the vector-ﬁeld of the right-hand sides
of (5), i.e. for existence of a scalar function ¯Q such that
ui = γ∇x ¯Q = γ∇u

∂xi∂xk = ∂uk

∂xk = −γ ∂

˙¯Q.

Thus, for SG-systems the extended form of the On-
sager equations (8) hold without linearization, i.e., they
are valid not only near the equilibrium state. In a spe-
cial case the condition (8) was proposed in [12]. The
theorem means that generalized Onsager relations (8)
are necessary and suﬃcient for the thermodynamics sys-
tem to obey the SG-principle for some ¯Q. On the other
hand, it is known that diﬀerent potential functions for the
same potential vector-ﬁeld can diﬀer only by a constant:
¯Q = Q + const and their stationary sets coincide. There-
fore, if the system tends to maximize its entropy and the
entropy serves as the goal function for the SG-evolution
law, then at every time instant the direction of change of
parameters coincides with the direction maximizing the
rate of entropy change (gradient of the entropy rate). It

follows from Zigler’s version of maximum entropy princi-
ple [13] that at every time instant it tends to minimize
its entropy production rate (Prigogine principle). That
is, if Prigogine principle holds then the generalized On-
sager principle (8) holds and vice versa. Note that for
special case the relation between Prigogine principle and
Onsager principle was established by D.Gyarmati [2].

For the SG-systems some other properties can be es-
tablished. Let for example a system is governed by
SG-law with a convex entropy goal function S. Then
the decrease of the entropy production ˙S readily fol-
lows from the identities ¨S = d ˙S/dt = (∇x ˙S)
˙x =
γ(∇x||∇xS||2)
∇xS = 2γ(∇xS)

xS](∇xS).

If the entropy S(x) is convex then its Hessian matrix
xS ≤ 0. Hence ¨S(x) ≤ 0
xS is negative semideﬁnite: ∇2

and ˙S cannot increase [5].

IV. SPEED-GRADIENT ENTROPY
MAXIMIZATION

It is worth noticing that the speed-gradient principle
provides an answer to the question: how the system will
evolve? It diﬀers from the principles of maximum en-
tropy, maximum Fisher information, etc. providing and
answer to the questions: where? and how far? Par-
ticularly, it means that SG-principle generates equations
for the transient (nonstationary) mode rather than the
equations for the steady-state mode of the system. It al-
lows one to study nonequilibrium and nonstationary sit-
uations, stability of the transient modes, maximum de-
viations from the limit mode, etc. Let us illustrate this
feature by example of entropy maximization problem.

According to the 2nd thermodynamics law and to the
Maximum Entropy Principle of Gibbs-Jaynes the en-
tropy of any physical system tends to increase until it
achieves its maximum value under constraints imposed
by other physical laws. Such a statement provides knowl-
edge about the ﬁnal distribution of the system states, i.e.
about asymptotic behavior of the system when t → ∞.
However it does not provide information about the way
how the system moves to achieve its limit (steady) state.
In order to provide motion equations for the transient
mode employ the SG-principle. Assume for simplicity
that the system consists of N identical particles dis-
tributed over m cells. Let Ni be the number of particles
in the ith cell and the mass conservation law holds:

3

(10)

[14]. Let the entropy of the system be deﬁned as loga-
rithm of the number of possible states:

S = ln

N !
N1! · · · · · Nm!

.

If there are no other constraints except normalization
condition (9) it achieves maximum when N ∗
i = N/m.
For large N an approximate expression is of use. Namely,
if the number of particles N is large enough, one may use
the Stirling approximation Ni! ≈ (Ni/e)N . Then

S ≈ N ln

which coincides with the standard deﬁnition for the en-

P

To get an answer for transient mode apply the SG-
m
principle choosing the entropy S(X) = −
i=1 Ni ln Ni
as the goal function to be maximized, where X =
col(N1, . . . , Nm) is the state vector of the system. As-
sume for simplicity that the motion is continuous in time
and the numbers Ni are changing continuously, i.e. Ni
are not necessarily integer (for large Ni it is not a strong
restriction). Then the sought law of motion can be rep-
resented in the form

P

˙Ni = ui, i = 1, . . . , m,

(11)

where ui = ui(t),
i = 1, . . . , m are controls – auxil-
iary functions to be determined. According to the SG-
principle one needs to evaluate ﬁrst the speed of change
of the entropy (10) with respect to the system (11), then
evaluate the gradient of the speed with respect to the
vector of controls ui considered as frozen parameters and
ﬁnally deﬁne actual controls proportionally to the pro-
jection of the speed-gradient to the surface of constraints
(9). In our case the goal function is the entropy S and
its speed coincides with the entropy production ˙S.
In
order to evaluate ˙S let us again approximate S from the
Stirling formula Ni! ≈ (Ni/e)N :

Assume that the particles can move from one cell to an-

in the steady-state and in the transient modes. The an-
swer for the steady-state case is given by the Maximum
Entropy Principle:
if nothing else is known about the

According to the SG-principle the equation (13) de-
termines transient dynamics of the system. To conﬁrm
consistency of the choice (13) let us ﬁnd the steady-state
mode, i.e. evaluate asymptotic behavior of the variables
Ni. To this end note that in the steady-state ˙Ni = 0 and
m
i=1 ln Ni = ln Ni. Hence all Ni are equal: Ni = N/m

agrees with thermodynamics.

The next step is to examine stability of the steady-

Lyapunov function V (X) = Smax − S(X) ≥ 0, where
Smax = N ln m. Evaluation of ˙V yields

It follows from the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz in-
equality that ˙V (X) ≤ 0 and the equality ˙V (X) = 0
holds if and only if all the values Ni are equal, i.e. only
at the maximum entropy state. Thus the law (13) pro-
vides global asymptotic stability of the maximum entropy
state. The physical meaning of the law (13) is moving
along the direction of the maximum entropy production
rate (direction of the fastest entropy growth).

The case of more than one constraint can be treated
in the same fashion. Let in addition to the mass con-
servation law (9) the energy conservation law hold. Let
Ei be the energy of the particle in the ith cell and the
m
total energy E =
i=1 NiEi be conserved. The energy
conservation law

appears as an additional constraint. Acting in a similar
way, we arrive at the law (13) which needs modiﬁcation
to ensure conservation of the energy (14). According to
the SG-principle one should form the projection onto the
surface (in our case – subspace of dimension m − 2) de-
ﬁned by the relations

(15)

It means that the evolution law should have the form

where λ1, λ2 are determined by substitution of (16) into

Let us evaluate the equilibrium point of the system
(11), (16) and analyze its stability. At the equilib-
rium point of the system the following equalities hold:
γ(− ln Ni) + λ1Ei + λ2 = 0, i = 1, . . . , m. Hence

Ni = C exp(−µEi), i = 1, . . . , m,

(18)

where µ = λ1/γ and C = exp(−λ2/γ).

P

The value of C can also be chosen from the normaliza-
m
tion condition C = N (
i=1 exp (−µEi)). We see that
equilibrium of the system with conserved energy corre-
sponds to the Gibbs distribution which agrees with clas-
sical thermodynamics. Again it is worth to note that the
direction of change of the numbers Ni coincides with the
direction of the fastest growth of the local entropy pro-
duction subject to constraints. As before, it can be shown
that V (X) = Smax − S(X) is Lyapunov function for the
system and that the Gibbs distribution is the only stable
equilibrium of the system in nongenerate cases. Simi-
lar results are valid for continuous (distributed) systems
even for more general problem of minimization of relative
entropy (Kullback divergence) [9].

Conclusions

Speed-gradient variational principle provides a useful
yet simple addition to classical results in thermodynam-
ics. Whereas the classical results allow researcher to an-
swer the question “Where it goes to?”, the speed-gradient
approach provides an answer to the question: “How it
goes and how it reaches its steady-state mode?” SG-
principle may be applied to evaluation of nonequilibrium
stationary states and study of system internal structure
evolution [15], description of transient dynamics of com-
plex networks [16, 17], etc. A diﬀerent approach to vari-
ational description of nonstationary nonequilibrium pro-
cesses is proposed in [18].

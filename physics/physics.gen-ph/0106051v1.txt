Abstract

The realms of gravitation, belonging to Classical Physics, and Elec-
tromagnetism, belonging to the Theory of the Electron and Quantum
Mechanics have remained apart as two separate pillars, inspite of a
century of eﬀort by Physicists to reconcile them. In this paper it is
argued that if we extend ideas of Classical spacetime to include in
addition to non integrability non commutavity also, then such a rec-
oncilation is possible.

1 Introduction

A problem that has troubled Physicists throughout the twentieth century
is that of a reconciliation of electromagnetism and gravitation into a sin-
gle theory. As Einstein noted in the Staﬀord Little Lectures in 1921[1],
”...if we introduce the energy tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the
right hand side (of the gravitational ﬁeld equation) we obtain (the ﬁrst of
Maxwell’s systems of equations in tensor density form), for the special case
This inclusion of the theory of electricity in the
(√
scheme of General Relativity has been considered arbitrary and unsatisfac-
tory... a theory in which the gravitational ﬁeld and the electromagnetic ﬁeld
do not enter as logically distinct structures would be much preferable...”
As we are beginning to realise now, and as we will see in the sequel, the
problem is, more generally, that of reconciling the spacetime used in Clas-
sical Physics including General Relativity with the spacetime of Quantum
Theory, that is the diﬀerence between what Witten calls Bosonic spacetime
and Fermionic spacetime. In the words of J.A. Wheeler[2], ”the most evi-
dent shortcoming of the geometrodynamic model as it stands is this, that it

fails to supply any completely natural place for spin 1
2 in general and for the
neutrino in particular”, while ”it is impossible to accept any description of
elementary particles that does not have a place for spin half.”
It should also be borne in mind that Classical spacetime which is also the
spacetime of General Relativity is not only deterministic, but it is also mean-
ingful to speak in terms of deﬁnite spacetime points. The Uncertainity Prin-
ciple on the other hand forbids such descriptions in a Quantum Mechanical
context. Indeed as Wheeler has noted[2] four dimensional spacetime exists
only as a classical approximation.
We will now argue that if in addition to non integrability non commutativ-
ity is also introduced into Classical spacetime, then it is possible to recover
the Quantum Mechanical description: this is the divide which keeps the two
apart.

2 Non Integrabilty and Non Commutativity

We start with the eﬀect of an inﬁnitessimal parallel displacement of a vector[3].
µνaµdxν

δaσ =

(1)

−

As is well known, (1) represents the extra eﬀect in displacements, due to the
curvature of space - in a ﬂat space, the right side would vanish. Considering
partial derivatives with respect to the µth coordinate, this would mean that,
due to (1)

∂aσ
∂xµ −
where the Γs are the Christoﬀel symbols. The second term on the right side
of (2) can be written as:

∂aσ
∂xµ →

Γσ

(2)

λaσ =
where we have utilized the linearity property that in the above formulation

ηµν being the Minkowski metric and hµν a small correction whose square is
neglected.
That is, (2) becomes,

(3)

gµν = ηµν + hµν,

∂xµ −

From (3) we get

∂xλ →

µv −

∂
∂xµ Γv

(4)

If we now impose the condition that the right hand side in (4) does not
vanish, then we have a non commutativity of the momentum components in
Quantum Theory. Indeed the left side of (4) can be written as

1
2 [pλ, pµ]
¯h

≈

0(1)
l2

where l is the Compton wavelength and ¯h the reduced planck length wherein
we have utilised the fact that at the extreme scale of the Compton wave-
length, the Planck scale being a special case, the momentum is mc.
If we write the right side of (4) as

then (4) can be written as

∼
where B is the magnetic ﬁeld, if we identify F µv with the electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor.
Equation (5) is the well known equation for the magnetic monopole. Indeed
it has been shown by Saito and the author[4, 5] that a non commutative
spacetime at the extreme scale throws up the monopole.
What we have shown here is that once we consider the non commutativity
of the right or left side of (4), then it is meaningful to identify

(5)

(6)

with the electromagnetic four potential, thus leading to a uniﬁcation of elec-
tromagnetism with gravitation theory. This uniﬁcation is not possible in the
usual commutative spacetime, that is when the right or left side of (4) vanish.
We now make a number of remarks which corroborate the above deductions.
The identiﬁcation of (6) with the electromagnetic vector potential was de-
duced and discussed at length though from a completely diﬀerent and infact
Quantum Mechanical point of view[6, 7, 8]. There the spinorial or pseudo

vector property of the Dirac four spinor was used, in a purely Quantum Me-
chanical derivation.
This has been discussed at length in the references cited. But brieﬂy, if the

Dirac bispinor is written as

, then at the Compton scale, it is the

 
spinor φ which predominates and moreover, under reﬂection,

Θ
φ !

→ −

This was shown to immediately lead to (3) or (6).
It was pointed out there that interestingly (6) was mathematically identiﬁed
to Weyl’s original formulation except that Weyl had introduced it ad hoc,
infact as an external element, without any internal derivation. This was why
Weyl’s formulation was rejected[1, 3].
The above considerations were shown to be a manifestation of the non point
like structure of spacetime, infact a non commutative spacetime[9]. We have
infact the non commutative geometry

[x, y] = 0(l2)

[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2
x];
(a/¯hc)2p2
t ];

[t, pt] = ı¯h[1

−
[x, py] = [y, px] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpy;
[x, pt] = c2[px,t] = ı¯h(a/¯h)2pxpt; etc.

whence, not only can the Dirac equation be deduced therefrom, but as al-
ready pointed out, also the existence of the magnetic monopole at extreme
Compton scales can be deduced[5]. It must be mentioned that such strong
magnetic ﬁelds can be shown to be associated with a non commutative ge-
ometry from an alternative point of view[4].
Interestingly the relations (7) reappear in Quantum SuperString Theory,
and as pointed out earlier are a manifestation of what Witten has called
Fermionic spacetime, as against the usual commutative geometry of Clas-
sical spacetime[10, 11, 12]. This non commutativity is at the root of the
emergence of electromagnetism and spin as can be seen from (5) or (6) and
subsequent remarks, and as can be seen from (7), this is an 0(l2) eﬀect.

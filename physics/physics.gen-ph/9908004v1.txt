DIMENSIONALITY AND FRACTALS

Abstract

In this paper we ﬁrst show that the usual three dimensionality of
space, which is taken for granted, results from the spinorial behaviour
of Fermions, which constitute the material content of the universe. It
is shown that the resulting three dimensionality rests on two factors
which have been hitherto ignored, viz., a Machian or holistic property
and the stochastic underpinning of the universe itself.
However the dimensionality is scale dependent in the sense that at very
large scales, or at very small scales, we encounter a diﬀerent dimen-
sionality, as indeed is borne out by observation and experiment. For
example the large scale structures in the universe are cellular in nature
on the one hand, and we encounter fractional charges and handedness
at very small scales.
Finally it is shown how fractal dimensions can emerge and as an il-
lustrative example it is shown how this could explain the magnetism
of objects like Planets on the one hand and White Dwarf stars and
Pulsars on the other.

1 Introduction

In Classical Physics and in Quantum Mechanics including Quantum Field
Theory it is tacitly assumed that space time intervals can be made arbi-
trarily small, even though Heisenberg’s Uncertainity Principle then dictates
that we will have to deal with arbitrarily large momenta and energies: Space

time, whether it be Riemannian or Minkowski is treated as a diﬀerentiable
manifold. Furthermore, barring exceptional cases space time is taken to have
three plus one dimensionality.
However over the past 15 years an alternative viewpoint has been fruitfully
explored namely that the space time of micro physics is fractal [1, 2, 3, 4].
Speciﬁcally, it was pointed out that at the De Broglie wavelength and be-
low, there was a doubling of dimensionality. This again was very suggestive,
because this fractal dimension is characteristic of Brownian motion [5] and
the link with the various attempts at a stochastic formulation of Quantum
Mechanics was opened up [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
We will now describe a recent formulation of elementary particles that com-
bines stochastic and Quantum Theory to provide a pleasing rationale to the
above considerations on the one hand, and justiﬁes and deduces from the
theory a picture consistent with data and observation.

2 Quantum Mechanical Black Holes

To start with let us ﬁrst adhoc treat an electron as a Kerr-Newman Black
Hole. As is well known [11] this classical Kerr-Newman metric accurately
describes the ﬁeld of an electron including the puzzling, purely Quantum
Mechanical gyro magnetic ratio g = 2. The price we have to pay for this
however is that, in classical terms there is a naked singularity: The horizon
of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole becomes complex [12],

r+ =

(

)1/2

thus contradicting the censorship hypothesis which forbids naked singulari-
ties. This is symptomatic of the fact that General Relativity and Quantum
Mechanics have been irreconcible.
On the other hand, the position coordinate for an electron as is well known
is given by [13]

xı = (c2pıH −1t + aı) +

ı
2

c¯h(αı −

cpıH −1)H −1,

where aı is an arbitrary constant with cαı the velocity operator with Eigen
c. It is also well known that the real part in (2) is the usual position
values

while the imaginary part arises from the Zitterbewegung, a rapid oscillation
that is inexplicable in classical terms.
the
What is interesting is that in both (1) and (2) the imaginary part is
Compton wavelength ¯h/mc. Equation (1) is inexplicable in classical physics
but arises naturally in Quantum Theory as in (2). From a Quantum Mechan-
ical point of view Dirac has explained the imaginary or Zitterbewegung part
by invoking the fact that according to the Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle,
measurement of space time points is unphysical. Our physical measurements
are averaged over intervals of atleast the Compton scale. As we will see
below the reconciliation of (1) and (2) comes from a combination of fractal
and stochastic approaches: Indeed in Nelson’s approach any particle is sub-
jected to an underlying Brownian motion described by forward and backward
Wiener processes, yielding the complex wave function of Quantum Mechan-
ics, while the doubling of the fractal dimension noted in Section 1 denotes
a transition from real to complex coordinates, as can be seen from (2) for
example.
Before proceeding further it may be mentioned that (1) and (2) yield a rec-
onciliation of General Relativity and Quantum Theory on the one hand and
a uniﬁcation of Electromagnetism and Gravitation on the other. This has
been described in detail for example, in [14, 15], the Kerr-Newman metric de-
scribing both the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds being symptomatic
of this fact.
Our starting point is the well known Random Walk equation

This is also the famous Eddington Large Number Relation, R being the
radius of the universe, N being the number of elementary particles, typically
pions and l the pion Compton wavelength. Given (3) one can easily deduce
that R = cT , where T is the age of the universe, and

where τ = l/c is the pion Compton time. In previous communications [16,
17, 18] (3) was used as the starting point for a stochastic formulation of
Quantum Theory. We will now indicate how the Dirac equation, and thereby
a formulation for the most elementary particles namely Quarks and Leptons
comes from (3).

R = l√N

T = √N τ

For this we ﬁrst observe that while (3) gives us the Compton wavelength of a
typical elementary particle, (2) and even (1) yield the Compton wavelength
and time as a minimum cut oﬀ space time interval. Infact it was shown that
the Compton scale or equivalently quantized space time at this scale could
be considered to be more fundamental than Planck’s energy quanta [16] in
the sense that the latter, which was a starting point for Quantum Theory
follows from the former. The concept of discrete space time has been studied
by several authors for over ﬁve decades [19, 20, 21]. It can also be shown to
provide a rationale for a maximal velocity c, and so Special Relativity itself
[16, 22]. On the other hand Snyder [19] showed that discrete space time is
compatible with Special Relativity and deduced

[x, y] = (ıa2/¯h)Lz,[t, x] = (ıa2/¯hc)Mx,

(5)

[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)2p2
x]
and similar equations where pµ denotes the four momentum and a the fun-
damental length and Lx, Mx etc. have their usual meaning. Interestingly as
a
0, we recover the usual commutation relations of Quantum Theory. A
coordinate shift in Minkowski space then gives

that

provides a representation for the coordinates x and t. Substitution of (8) in
(7) then gives the Dirac equation [23]

(γµpµ −

mc2)ψ = 0

Thus the Dirac equation is a consequence of quantized space time which itself
has its origins in the Random Walk equations (3) and (4).
The Quantum Mechanical spin half and the Compton scales symbolising
Zitterbewegung and the Brownian motion symbolised by (3) and (4), as also
the fractal doubling of dimensions referred to can all now be seen to be closely
interrelated.

We now observe that it is this spin half of Quantum Theory, that makes
it stand apart from classical physics. The big problem in the uniﬁcation of
General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics is precisely this spinorial double
connectivity [11]. On the other hand it is also the spin half that leads in a
natural way to three dimensional space [11, 24]. But the above description
and the three dimensionality, it must be stressed, are valid for scales greater
than the Compton scale. We now recapitulate a description of quarks and
neutrinos in the above model. For this we observe that at the Compton scale
itself the negative energy two spinor χ of the full four rowed Dirac spinor
begins to dominate. Moreover under reﬂections, χ behaves like a psuedo-
spinor,

that is as a density of weight n = 1, so that [12],

We can easily identify the electromagnetic four potential in (10). The fact
that n = 1 explains why the charge is discrete. We can also immediately see
the emergence of the metric tensor from the Γ′s (and the resulting potential).
We now use the fact that the metric tensor gµν resulting from (10) satisﬁes
an inhomogenous Poisson equation (Cf.[23] for details), whence

where now we require the volume of integration to be the Compton vol-
ume. As shown elsewhere [12, 14, 15, 25], given (11) which is also the lin-
earized equation of General Relativity, we can get a geometrized formulation
of Fermions leading to the Kerr-Newman metric and which explains the re-
markable and supposedly coincidental fact that the Kerr-Newman metric
describes the ﬁeld of an electron including the anomalous gyro magnetic ra-
tio g = 2.
All this was also shown to lead to a uniﬁed description of electromagnetism,
gravitation and strong interactions [14, 25].
We now show how a uniﬁed description of quarks and leptons can be obtained

where Tµν ≡
netism and strong interactions [25]. For this we need to obtain a formulation
for quarks from the above considerations. This is what we will brieﬂy reca-
pitulate.
The doubleconnectivity or spin half of the electron as mentioned earlier leads
naturally to three dimensional space [11]. This however breaks down at
Compton scales and so we need to consider two and one dimensions. Using
the well known fact that each of the ρuıuj in (12) is given by 1
3ǫ [26], ǫ being
the energy density, it follows immediately that the charge would be 2
3e or 1
3 e
in two or one dimensions, exactly as for quarks. At the same time as we are
now at the Compton scale, these fractionally charged particles are conﬁned
as is expressed by the conﬁning part of the QCD potential (14). Further, at

6

the Compton scale, as noted earlier we encounter predominantly the negative
energy components of the Dirac spinor with, opposite parity. So these quarks
would show neutrino type handedness, which indeed is true.
Thus at one stroke, all the peculiar empirical characteristics of the quarks
for which as Salam had noted [27], there was no theoretical rationale, can
now be deduced from theory. We can even get the correct order of magni-
tude estimate for the quark masses [25]. On the other hand neutrinos have
vanishingly small mass. So their Compton wavelength is very large and by
the same argument as above, we encounter predominantly the negative en-
ergy components of the Dirac spinor which have opposite parity, that is the
neutrinos display handedness.
Thus handedness and fractional charge are intimately tied up with dimen-
sionality.
It is interesting that the above conclusion about quarks in a low dimensional
context can be deduce from the more conventional analysis of Laughlin [28]
of the fractional Quantum Hall Eﬀect [29]. (In this context, it must be men-
tioned that fractional charges have recently been experimentally detected
[30]. Laughlin’s magnetic length now becomes the Compton wavelength
(Cf.[28]) and quarks show up as Laughlin’s fractionally charged quantum
ﬂuid of quasi electrons.
Infact if in Laughlin’s expression for total energy

we replace r by the Compton wavelength and the charge e by e/3 as seen
above, and equate this energy with mec2, , the electron energy and as r

103me that is the con-
of the Compton wavelength, we can deduce that m
stitutents of the quantum ﬂuid show up with quark masses, their fractional
charge and handedness.

3 Fractal Behaviour at De Broglie Scales and

Low Dimensions

As noted by Nottale and others [1], fractal behaviour should appear at De
Broglie scales. We will now demonstrate this fact in the context of an as-
sembly of Fermions below the Fermi temperature in which case we are at de
Broglie scales, and in low dimensions, from the point of view of the more

7

conventional non relativistic theory.
We ﬁrst observe that as is known [31] an assembly of Fermions below the
Fermi temperature occupies each and every single particle level, and this ex-
plains the fact that it behaves like a distribution of Bosonic phonons [32]:
The Fermions do not enjoy their normal degrees of freedom.
It is known that [31] the energy density ǫ below the Fermi energy is given by

where pF is the Fermi momentum. We can verify that the integral in (15) is

T 2.5
F , where TF is the Fermi temperature, so that we have,

∝

we conclude that the assembly behaves as if it has a fractal dimensionality
1.5. This explains the Bosonization or semionic eﬀect.
Interestingly, this could also provide a rationale for a Cooper type pair of
superconductity: Given the above fractal dimensionality, and using the fact
as seen in Section 2, that the charge per dimensions is e/3, it follows that
the charge of the Fermions would be e/2. So a pair of such charges would be
required for the usual charge e.
Another way to see this is that in the case of the Coulumb potential for
example the energy levels would be given by

rather than

as in conventional theory owing to the fact that the e2 of the electron is
replaced by e2/4. Eﬀectively n is replaced by 2n.
We now come to low dimensional behaviour. In one dimension the assem-
bly behaves as if it were below the Fermi temperature, whatever be the

8

temperature[32]. Indeed this low temperature Quantum nature has recently
been experimentally veriﬁed with carbon nanotubes [35].
We can come to a similar conclusion in the two dimensional case also. In
this case, for the Fermi temperature we can easily adapt the usual three
dimensional theory (cf.ref.[31]) to two dimensions to obtain

Equation (18) is the same as equation (17). However in this case we have
worked at an arbitrary temperature T . (It may be mentioned that we en-
counter the Quantum behaviour and two dimensionality at the interface be-
tween two semiconductors).
To sum up, there would be bosonization or semionic behaviour below the
Fermi temperature or in low dimensions - that is at the fractal De Broglie
scale.
Let us now consider an assembly of N electrons. As is known, if N+ is the
average number of particles with spin up, the magnetisation per unit volume
is given by

where µ is the electron magnetic moment. At low temperatures, in the usual

If N is very large, this makes an enormous diﬀerence in (19). Let us use (19)
and (20) for the case of Neutron stars.
In this case, as is well known, we have an assembly of degenerate electrons at
1011K (cf.for ex-
temperatures

Some White Dwarfs also have magnetic ﬁelds. If the White Dwarf has an
interior of the dimensions of a Neutron star, with a similar magnetic ﬁeld,
then remembering that the radius of a White Dwarf is about 103 times that
of a Neutron star, its magnetic ﬁeld would be 10−6 times that of the neutron
star, which is known to be the case.
It is quite remarkable that the above mechanism can also explain the mag-
netism of the earth [37]. As is known the earth has a solid core of radius
of about 1200 kilometers and temperature about 6000 K [38]. This core is
made up almost entirely of Iron (90%) and Nickel (10%). It can easily be

It may be mentioned that the anomalous Bosonic behaviour given in (20)
would imply a sensitivity to external magnetic inﬂuences which could lead
to eﬀects like magnetic ﬂips or reversals.
To see this, we observe that the number of electrons, with spin aligned along

Indeed in the case of the earth, magnetic reversals do take place from time
to time and are as yet not satisfactorily explained [39].

4 Discussion

In the light of the preceding considerations we now make the following ob-
servations:
1. As mentioned earlier all of contemporary physics, from General Relativity
to Quantum Field Theory assumes a space time continuum, but as pointed
out by Nottale[1], scale relativity has been ignored, even though Heisenberg’s
Uncertainity Principle attributes arbitrarily large momenta and energy for
arbitrarily small space time intervals.
Infact it has been shown that [40]
if there is a break in scale, then we recover the Compton wavelength. As
pointed out the fractal dimensions of space time at the Compton scale have
been deduced by Nottale and Ord. In the nonrelativistic case the fractal di-
mensionality begins at the De Broglie wavelength as suggested by the work
of Abbott-Wise(Cf.ref.[1]). However, at larger scales, there is scale indepen-
dence. The minimum space time intervals referred to earlier express precisely
this fact. At very large scales again, the structures of the universe display
cellular and ﬁlamentary characteristics symptomatic of fractality[41].
If these minimum space time cut oﬀs are ignored, as pointed out elsewhere
[12, 18], we encounter the divergences of Quantum Field Theory. On the
other hand, once they are recognized the naked singularities of General Rel-
ativity get fudged and disappear as seen in Section 2 and what Wheeler calls
the greatest crisis of Physics is overcome, and also the irreversibility of time,
via the Kaon experiment for example is explained[18].
As T.D. Lee and others have observed [20, 21] the space time continuum is
but an approximation. Unphysical eﬀects like divergences, Zitterbewegung,
reversed time or negative energies or chaotic spin ﬂips which appear in a gen-

11

eralization of the stochastic formulation to relativistic Quantum Mechanics
are all symptomatic of this approximation being ignored.
It is also interesting to note that the minimum space time cut oﬀ, be it at
the De Broglie scale in the nonrelativistic case or the Compton scale in the
relativistic case involves the mass. Further it has been noted by Nottale and
others, that Quantum Mechanical properties like spin and the wave function
can be attributed to this fractal structure [1]. It has also been shown that
properties like mass and spin result from the space time cut oﬀs[12].
2. In previous communications[12, 16] a pleasing correspondence was seen be-
tween the Quantum Mechanical Black Holes of Section 2 on the one hand, and
the De Broglie-Bohm hydromechanical formulation, as also Nelson’s stochas-
tic formulation on the other hand. The former follows from the latter if we
consider the scale of the Compton length and time in which case there is a
doubling of coordinates which is precisely expressed by the fractal dimension
being double the usual dimension, as referred to earlier. This is also the rea-
son for the puzzling and inexplicable fact that Newman’s imaginary shift of
coordinates leads from the classical Kerr metric to the Kerr-Newman metric
which is Quantum Mechanical as seen in Section 2. This complexiﬁcation
is again symptomatic of the fractal doubling of dimensions. However as ob-
served by Nottale [1] all this should not be construed as the hidden variable
theory, because of the stochastic and unpredictable underpinning.
3. We would like to re-emphasize that the fractality of space time in micro
physics, at Compton scales implies that the usual concept of an iron clad
space time has to be replaced by the concept of a Brownian space time heap
the Compton scale being, as seen above, the cut oﬀ mean path length or
size. To put it in a pictorial manner, this is like the Richardson scenario [5]
of delineating a jagged coastline with a thickened smooth curve, the thickness
being the Compton scale akin to the mean free path of Wheeler’s travelling
salesman as shown elsewhere [23]. However it should be pointed out that this
picture is Machian or holistic, as indeed is expressed by equations like (3) and
(4), or other large number relations of cosmology that can be deduced from
the theory [42] like Weinberg’s so called mysterious and empirical relation
that expresses the pion mass in terms of the Hubble Constant.

Abstract

Solely based on the facts in relativity, we show that there is uncertainty in

determining the ds2 of a free particle. The proper time of the free particle, if it

is deﬁned according to its ds2, is therefore found not to be physically deﬁnite.

The way to solve the problem is proposed, and the eﬀect of gravity on proper

time is studied.

The proper time of a free particle, or the proper time in the inertial reference frame

established on the particle, is referred to the reading of the clock attached on it[1]. In

special relativity it is mathematically given by the world line element

ds2 = dxµdxµ = (dx0)2

(dx1)2

(dx2)2

(dx3)2,

of the particle: when there is such a inertial reference frame that the particle is at rest

in it, ds2 reduces to

ds2 = (dx0)2 = c2dt2,

(1)

(2)

thus ds is essentially the time apart from the constant c2.

In this way the proper

time of a free particle is deﬁned as the invariant s/c. This approach can be naturally

generalized to deﬁne the proper time in non-initial reference frame and even so-called

cosmic time[2]. However, we prove in this letter that the world line element of a free

particle is in fact not physically deﬁnite, so the proper time for a free particle deﬁned

by Eq.(2) doesn’t really correspond to the reading of the clock ﬁxed on the particle,

an invariant physical process.

Our proof is based on the following two facts in special relativity.

Fact 1: Equivalence of all inertial reference frames. According to it the deﬁnition of

proper time Eq.(2) is universal to all inertial reference frames. In any of these reference

frames, say K, if there are two free particles, one of which moves at a uniform speed v

while the other is at rest, then, to the observer in K, the world line elements of them

are

ds2

1 = c2dt2

v2dt2,

−

ds2

2 = c2dt2,

(3a)

(3b)

respectively, where t is the proper time of the particle at rest.

Fact 2: Lorentz transformation. It describes the connection between two equivalent

inertial reference frames, i.e. the transformation of covariant quantities measured in

one reference frame to those measured in the other. For the space-time diﬀerentials, a

boost along x1 axis is as follows:

cdt′ = γ(cdt

βdx1),

(dx1)′ = γ(dx1

βcdt),

−
(dx2)′ = dx2,

(dx3)′ = dx3.

x1 = vt,

x2 =

vt,

−

The validity of the fact requires that the observables obtained in one inertial reference

frame are one-to-one correspondent to those obtained in all other inertial reference

frames.

Suppose in inertial reference frame K there are two free particles, say O1 and O2,

with the same velocity but opposite moving directions:

and the clocks ﬁxed on them are synchronized with the clock at rest as they both pass

by the origin of the spatial coordinates of K. At this time observer A at the origin of

K ﬁnds that the world line elements of O1 and O2 are equal:

ds2

1 = ds2

2 = c2dt2

v2dt2,

−

where t is the proper time of the particle at rest in K. If we perform Lorentz transfor-

mation from K to the reference frame K’ on one of the particles, say O1, then, according

to Eq. (4) and (5), ds2

1 and ds2

2 are respectively transformed to ds′2

1 and ds′2

2 with the

following expression:

where t′

1 = γ−1t, t′

2 = γ(1 + v2

c2 )t and u = −2v

1+v2/c2 . Eqs. (6) and (7) combined gives

which, as the consequence of Fact 2, forms the judgment that, to observer B in K’, the

world line elements of O1 and O2 still keep equal.

On the other hand, according to Fact 1, observer B should independently get the

measurement of ds′2

1 and ds′2

2 with the following expression

ds′2

1 = c2(dt′)2,

ds′2

2 = (c2

w2)(dt′)2,

−

ds′2
1 6

= ds′2
2 .

where t’ is the proper time of O1, and w

= 0 because in K’ O2 is in motion while O1

is at rest. From Eq. (9) observer B deﬁnitely knows

Consequently the same observer B in K’ draws the contradictory conclusions Eqs. (8)

and (10) about the comparison of the world line element of O2 with his own. To him,

the measurement transformed from K goes against that he directly obtained with his

own measuring apparatus. Sticking to the two above-mentioned facts, ds2

2 cannot be

determined in K’ where ds2

1 is used as the standard. Similarly, in the reference frame

established on O2, ds2

1 cannot be determined too.

From the above discussion we see that the world line element of a free particle is

not physically deﬁnite.

It leads to problem when it is used to deﬁne the physically

deﬁnite quantities, for example, the proper time of a free particle in Eq. (2). Consider

again the above discussed situation. Taking the reading of the clock at rest in K as

the standard, we calculate the proper time of O2 in diﬀerent reference frame K and K’.

When the reading of the clock ﬁxed on K is T0, observer A in K reaches the relation

between the readings of the clocks ﬁxed on the moving particles and that of his own is

Similarly, observer B in K’ arrives at the following relation between the reading of his

own clock and that of O2:

Substituting Eq. (11) into Eq. (12), we have

1 = τ A

2 = q1

Obviously there are two diﬀerent measures of proper time τ A

2 and τ B

2 of O2, which are

obtained in diﬀerent reference frames. Thus it can be seen that the physical existence

of the proper time of a free particle is problematic, if we deﬁne it with the ds2 of the

particle.

The defectiveness of the ds2 deﬁnition of proper time can also explain the famous

“twin paradox”[3]. Suppose Clock 1 moves at a uniform velocity v relatively to Clock

2. On Clock 1 we can infer through the deﬁntion that, if the change of its own reading

is ∆t, the change of Clock 2’s reading will be

∆t′ =

∆t.

q1

v2/c2

−
because ∆s1 = c2∆t2 is invariant. However, to keep the invariance of ∆s2 = c2∆t′2,

the reading of Clock 1 must have increased by

∆t =

q1

v2/c2

∆t′

−
after ∆t′ passed on Clock 2. Eqs. (14) and (15) are just what the paradox says. The

deﬁnition itself implies the paradox.

Next let us analyze the cause for the uncertainty of ds2. We think that the uncer-

tainty arises from the incompatibility of Fact 1 and 2. Here we interpret it with the

following diagram (the directions of arrows indicate the comparison of one quantity

(14)

(15)

with another).

The equivalence of all inertial reference frames requires that the measurements under-

taken in diﬀerent reference frames are completely independent, while the measures of

covariant (invariant) physical quantities in diﬀerent reference frames must be one-to-

one correspondent through Lorentz transformation. Fact 2 only gives the two equalities

on the top and the bottom, but Fact 1 gives the equality on the left and the inequal-

ity on the right, since the measurements in K and K’ don’t interfere with each other.

The noncommutation of the diagram thus displays the diﬃculty we encounter in de-

termining the ds2s of free particles from diﬀerent reference frames, a logical ﬂaw in the

present-day’s theory.

To solve the dilemma, we adopt the operational deﬁnition of proper time instead of

its ds2 deﬁnition. This approach [4][5] requires the distinction of the real physical refer-

ence frames from the abstract mathematical coordinates, which are confused with the

physical refernce frames in the present-day’s theory of relativity. A physical reference

frame, be it inertial or non-inertial, is a laboratory that should be massive enough to

enable the radiation component of a atomic clock to be rigidly installed in the steady

crystal at rest in it. The proper time in the physical reference frame is determined

through the proper frequency ν of the electronic transition of the frequency-determining

chemical element, for example Cs-133, of the atomic clock ﬁxed on the reference frame

and shielded from electromagnetic interference. An ideal testing atomic clock is in fact

a frequency standard with the average of its observed radiation period τ = 1/ν used as

the observed time unit measured from the reference frame in which it is moving, and

the proper time of the reference frame, to which the testing atomic clock is ﬁxed, is by

6

this deﬁnition just the reading of it. The role of testing atomic clock is similar to that

of testing charge in electromagnetic theory. In a inertial reference frame without the

disturbance of the external forces the proper frequency formula is

hν0 = E1 −

E2,

(16)

where E1, E2 are the atomic energy levels. τ0 = 1/ν0 serves as the proper time unit in

the reference frame. The study of Doppler shift of ν0 [4][6] caused by the recoil eﬀect of

the massive objects, on which the physical reference frames are established, gives alter-

native explanation for such relativistic eﬀect as time dialation. Within this framework

of theory Lorentz transformation can be relegated to a relation reﬂecting the mathe-

matical symmetry of electromagnetic ﬁeld equation, and the world line element of a

free particle is regarded only as a useful calculational expression rather than something

that can be physically observed, so the incompatibility of the above-mentioned facts

doesn’t harm anymore.

Furthermore this approach can be applied to study the eﬀect of gravity on proper

time. Three postulates underlie our discussion: 1)The equivalence principle of inertial

and gravitational mass; 2)The generalized mass-energy relation, which stipulates for

the eﬀective mass hν

c2 for a photon with the observed frequency ν; 3)The existence of the
special reference frame S in which the inﬂuence of the gravitational ﬁeld is negligible
(its distances from the gravitational sources Ri ≫
by the ideal atomic clock attached on S is just ν0 given by Eq.

ν0 is
supposed to be the proper time determination standard for all other reference frames

1). The proper frequency measured

(16); τ0 = 1

in gravitational ﬁeld. Because the negligible solar gravitational eﬀect compared with

that of earth, the reference frame established at the center of the earth can be regarded

approximately as S when we study the physical phenomena on the surface of the earth.

In this case we can set the gravitational potential zero at the center of the earth, so the

potential on its surface is GM

2R . Similarly we can choose the approximate time-standard
reference frames on diﬀerent celestial body system as the one established at the mass

center of the system.. With regard to the three postulates, the frequency formula Eq.

where ϕi is the potential produced by the gravity source Mi, and v1, v2 are the velocities

of the testing atom clock before and after emmitting photon in S. If the testing atomic

clock is at rest in S, the observed frequency ν at the clock’s location is just the proper

frequency in the physical reference frame on which it is ﬁxed. When the testing atomic

clock is in motion according to the time-standard reference frame S, the proper time

unit in the atomic clock reference frame is much more complicate. Its most general

form is given by the function:

τp =

= τ (v1; v2; M1, . . . , Mn).

The eﬀect of gravity on proper time is also discussed in detail in [4]. Our diﬀerence

from L. Brillioun’s work is postulate (3) and the coupling of the eﬀective photon mass

to gravitational potential ϕg. According to him, hν/c2 is “insensitive” to gravitational

potential.

As an example we study the situation of a central-force ﬁeld with potential ϕ =

The obtained expression for ν from Eqs. (19) is rather complicate, however, if the

testing atomic clock is massive enough to neglect the recoil eﬀect on it (in this case
we can take E1 ≈

E2), we can simplify it with some further approximations: 1)When

(21)

The proper frequency shift reﬂects the eﬀect of gravity on the proper time (with unit

τ = 1

ν ) at diﬀerent lacation of the gravitational ﬁeld, as the inhomogeneous ds2 does
in general relativity. 2)When the coupling of photon eﬀective mass with gravitational

ﬁeld is very small ( hνGM

S:

The diﬀerence of Eq. (21) from relativity is that the observed times of all other physical

references are dilated with respect to the standard proper time with unit 1/ν0, so the

clocks on them going at diﬀerent speeds indicate really diﬀerent speeds of proper times

in diﬀerent physical reference frames. Therefore it avoids “twin paradox” or similar

between two reference frames, because S is relativily absolute in the gravitational ﬁeld.

The local proper frequency of the radiation given by an ideal testing atomic clock is

a deﬁnite physical quantity that provides the direct determination of the local proper

time. In a gravitational ﬁeld it is related to the observed frquency in the approximate

time-standard reference frame S that is to some extend determined absolutely by the

conﬁguration of the gravitational ﬁeld. The shift of the frequency in Eq. (16) caused

by Doppler eﬀect and gravity well explains the available experimental results, and

moreover, this approach works without the trouble in the ds2 deﬁnition of proper time,

which indicates a logical ﬂaw in the present-day theory. In fact what we can directly

measure in a physical reference is not the abstract ∆t, but the proper frequency of the

periodic phenomena taking place in it. It is the physical observables that forms the

foudation for all discussions with true physical meaning.

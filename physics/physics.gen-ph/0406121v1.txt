Abstract

The Gravity Probe B (GP-B) satellite experiment will measure the precession of
on-board gyroscopes to extraordinary accuracy. Such precessions are predicted by
General Relativity (GR), and one component of this precession is the ‘frame-dragging’
or Lense-Thirring eﬀect, which is caused by the rotation of the earth. A new theory
of gravity, which passes the same extant tests of GR predicts, however, a second and
much larger ‘frame-dragging’ precession. The magnitude and signature of this larger
eﬀect is predicted for comparison with the GP-B data.

Introduction

The Gravity Probe B (GP-B) satellite experiment was launched in April 2004. It has
the capacity to measure the precession of four on-board gyroscopes to unprecedented
accuracy [1, 2, 3, 4]. Such a precession is predicted by the Einstein theory of gravity,
General Relativity (GR), with two components (i) a geodetic precession, and (ii) a
‘frame-dragging’ precession known as the Lense-Thirring eﬀect. The latter is partic-
ularly interesting eﬀect induced by the rotation of the earth, and described in GR
in terms of a ‘gravitomagnetic’ ﬁeld. According to GR this smaller eﬀect will give
a precession of 0.042 arcsec per year for the GP-B gyroscopes. However a recently
developed theory gives a diﬀerent account of gravity. While agreeing with GR for all
the standard tests of GR this theory gives a dynamical account of the so-called ‘dark
matter’ eﬀect in spiral galaxies. It also succesfully predicts the masses of the black
holes found in the globular clusters M15 and G1. Here we show that GR and the
new theory make very diﬀerent predictions for the ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect, and so the
GP-B experiment will be able to decisively test both theories. While predicting the
same earth-rotation induced precession, the new theory has an additional much larger
‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect caused by the observed translational motion of the earth. As
well the new theory explains the ‘frame-dragging’ eﬀect in terms of vorticity in a
‘substratum ﬂow’. Herein the magnitude and signature of this new component of

the gyroscope precession is predicted for comparison with data from GP-B when it
becomes available.

2 Theories of Gravity

The Newtonian ‘inverse square law’ for gravity,

F =

Gm1m2
r2

,

∇.g = −4πGρ,

was based on Kepler’s laws for the motion of the planets. Newton formulated gravity
in terms of the gravitational acceleration vector ﬁeld g(r, t), and in diﬀerential form

where ρ(r, t) is the matter density. However there is an alternative formulation in
terms of a vector ‘ﬂow’ ﬁeld v(r, t) determined by

∂
∂t

(∇.v) + ∇.((v.∇)v) = −4πGρ,

with g now given by the Euler ‘ﬂuid’ acceleration

Trivially this g also satisﬁes (2). External to a spherical mass M of radius R a velocity
ﬁeld solution of (3) is

which gives from (4) the usual inverse square law g ﬁeld

However the ﬂow equation (3) is not uniquely determined by Kepler’s laws because

also has the same external solution (5), because C(v) = 0 for the ﬂow in (5). So
the presence of the C(v) would not have manifested in the special case of planets
in orbit about the massive central sun. Here α is a dimensionless constant - a new
gravitational constant, in addition to usual the Newtonian gravitational constant G.
However inside a spherical mass we ﬁnd [5] that C(v) 6= 0, and using the Greenland
borehole g anomaly data [6] we ﬁnd that α−1 = 139 ± 5, which gives the ﬁne structure
constant α = e2¯h/c ≈ 1/137 to within experimental error. From (4) we can write

where

∇.g = −4πGρ − 4πGρDM ,

ρDM (r) =

(11)

which introduces an eﬀective ‘matter density’ representing the ﬂow dynamics associ-
ated with the C(v) term. In [5] this dynamical eﬀect is shown to be the ‘dark matter’
eﬀect. The interpretation of the vector ﬂow ﬁeld v is that it is a manifestation, at
the classical level, of a quantum substratum to space; the ﬂow is a rearrangement
of that substratum, and not a ﬂow through space. However (7) needs to be further
generalised [5] to include vorticity, and also the eﬀect of the motion of matter through
this substratum via

vR(r0(t), t) = v0(t) − v(r0(t), t),
where v0(t) is the velocity of an object, at r0(t), relative to the same frame of reference
that deﬁnes the ﬂow ﬁeld; then vR is the velocity of that matter relative to the
substratum. The ﬂow equation (7) is then generalised to, with d/dt = ∂/∂t + v.∇
the Euler ﬂuid or total derivative,

and so GR also uses the Euler ‘ﬂuid’ derivative, and we obtain a set of equations
analogous but not identical to (13)-(14). In vacuum, with Tµν = 0, we ﬁnd that (22)
demands that

((trD)

− tr(D

(23)

This simply corresponds to the fact that GR does not permit the ‘dark matter’ dy-
namical eﬀect, namely that ρDM = 0, according to (11). This happens because GR
was forced to agree with Newtonian gravity, in the appropriate limits, and that theory
also has no such eﬀect. The predictions from (13)-(14) and from (22) for the Gravity
Probe B experiment are diﬀerent, and provide an opportunity to test both gravity
theories.

‘Frame-Dragging’ as a Vorticity Eﬀect

Here we consider one diﬀerence between the two theories, namely that associated with
the vorticity part of (18), leading to the ‘frame-dragging’ or Lense-Thirring eﬀect. In
GR the vorticity ﬁeld is known as the ‘gravitomagnetic’ ﬁeld B = −c ~ω. In both GR
and the new theory the vorticity is given by (16) but with a key diﬀerence:
in GR
vR is only the rotational velocity of the matter in the earth, whereas in (13)-(14)
vR is the vector sum of the rotational velocity and the translational velocity of the
earth through the substratum. At least seven experiments have detected this trans-
lational velocity; some were gas-mode Michelson interferometers and others coaxial
cable experiments [8, 9, 10], and the translational velocity is now known to be ap-
proximately 430 km/s in the direction RA = 5.2h, Dec= −670. This direction has
been known since the Miller [11] gas-mode interferometer experiment, but the RA was
more recently conﬁrmed by the 1991 DeWitte coaxial cable experiment performed in
the Brussels laboratories of Belgacom [9]. This ﬂow is related to galactic gravity ﬂow
eﬀects [8, 9, 10], and so is diﬀerent to that of the velocity of the earth with respect
to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which is 369 km/s in the direction
RA = 11.20h, Dec = −7.220.

First consider the common but much smaller rotation induced ‘frame-dragging’ or

where L is the angular momentum of the earth, and r is the distance from the centre.
This component of the vorticity ﬁeld is shown in Fig.1. Vorticity may be detected by
observing the precession of the GP-B gyroscopes. The vorticity term in (18) leads to
a torque on the angular momentum S of the gyroscope (here we can take vR/c → 0
in the denominator),

GP-B the direction of S has been chosen so that this precession is cumulative and,

velocity over one 96 minute GP-B orbit, from the vorticity induced by the translation of the
earth. The orbit time begins at location S. Predictions are for the months of April, August,
September and February, labeled by increasing dash length. These changes arise from the
eﬀects of the changing orbital velocity of the earth about the sun. The GP-B expected angle
measurement accuracy is 0.0005 arcsec. Novel gravitational waves will aﬀect these plots.

on averaging ~ω/2 over an orbit, corresponds to some 7.7 × 10−6 arcsec per orbit, or
0.042 arcsec per year. GP-B has been superbly engineered so that measurements to
a precision of 0.0005 arcsec are possible.

However for the unique translation-induced precession we use vR = vC = 430km/s

in the direction RA = 5.2hr, Dec = −670. Then (16) gives

This much larger component of the vorticity ﬁeld is shown in Fig.2. The maxi-
mum magnitude of the speed of this precession component is ω/2 = gvC /c2 =
8 × 10−6arcsec/s, where here g is the gravitational acceleration at the altitude of
the satellite. This precession has a diﬀerent signature:
it is not cumulative, and is
detectable by its variation over each single orbit, as its orbital average is zero, to
1
2 ~ω(r(t′))dt′|, the computed magni-
ﬁrst approximation. Fig.3 shows |∆ˆS(t)| ≈ |
tude of this vorticity induced precession over one orbit, and it is seen to be some 30×
larger than the expected GP-B errors, and so easily detectable, if it exists as predicted
herein. This integrated expression is valid because the change in S on the RHS of (26)
is negligible. Because the yearly orbital rotation of the earth about the sun slightly
eﬀects vC [9] predictions for four months throughout the year are shown. Such yearly
eﬀects were ﬁrst seen in the Miller [11] experiment. Also as discussed in [8, 10] the

ﬂow equations (13)-(14) have wave-like perturbative solutions, and these appear to be
in the experimental data, particularly the DeWitte data, and these also are predicted
to be easily detectable by GP-B, as they correspond to some 10% variation in the
magnitude and direction of vC. However they have negligible eﬀect upon g [8, 10].

The other non-vorticity acceleration terms in (18) also result in torques on the gy-
roscope, and the magnitude and signature of the resultant precessions will be reported
elsewhere, and are required in the data analysis.

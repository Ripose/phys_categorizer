Possible Negative Pressure States in the Evolution of the Universe

ABSTRACT

Hydrodynamic derivation of the entrainment of matter induced by a surface elastic
wave propagating along the ﬂexible vacuum-matter interface is conducted by considering
the nonlinear coupling between the interface and the rarefaction eﬀect. The critical
reﬂux values associated with the product of the second-order (unit) body forcing and
the Reynolds number (representing the viscous dissipations) decrease as the Knudsen
number (representing the rarefaction measure) increases from zero to 0.1. We obtained
the critical bounds for matter-freezed or zero-volume-ﬂow-rate states corresponding to
speciﬁc Reynolds numbers (ratio of wave inertia and viscous dissipation eﬀects) and
wave numbers which might be linked to the evolution of the Universe. Our results also
show that for positive evolution of the matter (the maximum speed of the matter (gas)
appears at the center-line) there might be existence of negative pressure.

Introduction

The mean cosmic density of dark matter (plus baryons) is now pinned down to be only ca.
30% of the so-called critical density corresponding to a ’ﬂat’-Universe. However, other recent evi-
dence—microwave background anisotropies, complemented by data on distant supernovae—reveals
that our Universe actually is ’ﬂat’, but that its dominant ingredient (ca. 70% of the total mass
energy) is something quite unexpected: ’dark energy’ pervading all space, with negative pressure.
We do know that this material is very dark and that it dominates the internal kinematics, clus-
tering properties and motions of galactic systems. Dark matter is commonly associated to weakly
interacting particles (WIMPs), and can be described as a ﬂuid with vanishing pressure. It plays
a crucial role in the formation and evolution of structure in the universe and it is unlikely that
galaxies could have formed without its presence (Comelli et al. 2003; Padmanabhan 2003). Anal-

where k = 0 is for the ﬂat-Universe, ρ and p is the density and pressure (Overduin & Priester
2001; ˇStefanˇci´c 2004). A large majority of dark energy models describes dark energy in terms of the
equation of state (EOS) pd = ω ρd, where ω is the parameter of the EOS, while pd and ρd denote the
1 is characteristic of
pressure and the energy density of dark energy, respectively. The value ω =
the cosmological constant, while the dynamical models of dark energy generally have ω
1. The
case of the growing cosmological term Λ and its implications for the asymptotic expansion of the
universe and the destiny of the bound systems have been studied in ( ˇStefanˇci´c 2004) using above
system of equations. Their results showed that even for very slow growth of Λ (which satisﬁes all
the conditions on the variation of GN ), in the distant future the gravitationally bound systems
become unbound, while the nongravitationally bound systems remain bound.
Meanwhile, it is convenient to express the mean densities ρi of various quantities in the Universe
in terms of their fractions relative to the critical density: Ωi = ρi/ρcrit. The theory of cosmological
inﬂation strongly suggests that the total density should be very close to the critical one (Ωtot
1),
and this is supported by the available data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.
The ﬂuctuations observed in the CMB at a level ca. 10−5 in amplitude exhibit a peak at a partial

lower partial waves, l
200, the CMB ﬂuctuations are believed to be dominated by the Sachs-Wolfe
eﬀect due to the gravitational potential, and more acoustic oscillations are expected at l > 200,
1000, these os-
whose relative heights depend on the baryon density Ωb. At even larger values, l
cillations should be progressively damped away (Comelli et al. 2003; Padmanabhan 2003; Narlikar
& Padmanabhan 2001; Solomon & Vanden Bout 2005).
Inﬂuential only over the largest of scales-the cosmological horizon-is the outermost species of invis-
ible matter: the vacuum energy (also known by such names as dark energy, quintessence, x-matter,
the zero-point ﬁeld, and the cosmological constant Λ). If there is no exchange of energy between
vacuum and matter components, the requirement of general covariance implies the time dependence
of the gravitational constant G. Thus, it is interesting to look at the interacting behavior between
the vacuum (energy) and the matter from the macroscopic point of view. One related issue, say, is
about the dissipative matter of the ﬂat Universe immersed in vacua (Klinkhamer & Volovik 2005)

and the other one is the macroscopic Casimir eﬀect with the deformed boundaries (Casimir 1948;
Milton 2004).
Theoretical (using the Boltzmann equation) and experimental studies of interphase nonlocal trans-
port phenomena which appear as a result of a diﬀerent type of nonequilibrium representing prop-
agation of a surface elastic wave have been performed since late 1980s (Borman et al. 1987; Chu
2002). These are relevant to rareﬁed gases (RG) ﬂowing along deformable elastic slabs with the
dominated parameter being the Knudsen number (Kn = mean-free-path/Ld, mean-free-path (mfp)
is the mean free path of the gas, Ld is proportional to the distance between two slabs) (Kogan
1969; Einzel & Parpia 1997). The role of the Knudsen number is similar to that of the Navier slip
parameter Ns (Navier 1827; de Gennes 2002); here, Ns = µS/d is the dimensionless Navier slip
parameter; S is a proportionality constant as us = Sτ , τ : the shear stress of the bulk velocity; us
, µ
: the dimensional slip velocity; for a no-slip case, S = 0, but for a no-stress condition. S =
is the ﬂuid viscosity, d is one half of the distance between upper and lower slabs).
Here, the transport driven by the wavy elastic vacuum-matter interface will be presented. The
ﬂat-Universe is presumed and the corresponding matter is immersed in vacua with the interface
being ﬂat-plane like. We adopt the macroscopic or hydrodynamical approach and simplify the orig-
inal system of equations (related to the momentum and mass transport) to one single higher-order
quasi-linear partial diﬀerential equation in terms of the unknown stream function. In this study, we

Navier-Stokes equations which are associated with the relaxed slip velocity boundary conditions
along the interfaces (Navier 1827; Kogan 1969; Einzel & Parpia 1997; de Gennes 2002). We then
introduce the perturbation technique so that we can solve the related boundary value problem ap-
proximately. To consider the originally quiescent gas for simplicity, due to the diﬃculty in solving
a fourth-order quasi-linear complex ordinary diﬀerential equation (when the wavy boundary condi-
tion are imposed), we can ﬁnally get an analytically perturbed solution and calculate those physical
quantities we have interests, like, time-averaged transport or entrainment, perturbed velocity func-
tions, critical unit body forcing corresponding to the freezed or zero-volume-ﬂow-rate states. These
results might be closely linked to the vacuum-matter interactions (say, macroscopic Casimir eﬀects)
and the evolution of the Universe (as mentioned above : the critical density (Comelli et al. 2003),
the growing cosmological term ( ˇStefanˇci´c 2004)).

2. Formulations

We consider a two-dimensional matter-region of uniform thickness which is approximated by

a homogeneous rareﬁed gas (Newtonian viscous ﬂuid). The equation of motion is

u + ρp = ρ

where λL and µ are Lam´e constants, u is the displacement ﬁeld (vector), ρ is the mass density and
p is the body force for unit mass. The Navier-Stokes equations, valid for Newtonian ﬂuids (both

gases and liquids), has been a mixture of continuum ﬂuid mechanics ever since 1845 following the
seemingly deﬁnitive work of Stokes and others (Stokes 1845; Truesdell 1953), who proposed the
following rheological constitutive expression for the ﬂuid deviatoric or viscous stress (tensor) T :
T = 2µ
The ﬂat-plane boundaries of this matter-region or the vacuum-matter interfaces are rather ﬂexible
and presumed to be elastic, on which are imposed traveling sinusoidal waves of small amplitude a
(possibly due to vacuum ﬂuctuations). The vertical displacements of the upper and lower interfaces
(y = h and
ct)/λ], λ

is the wave length, and c the wave speed. x and y are Cartesian coordinates, with x measured in
the direction of wave propagation and y measured in the direction normal to the mean position of
the vacuum-matter interfaces. The schematic plot of above features is shown in Fig. 1.
It would be expedient to simplify these equations by introducing dimensionless variables. We have
a characteristic velocity c and three characteristic lengths a, λ, and h. The following variables
based on c and h could thus be introduced :

where ψ is the dimensional stream function, u and v are the velocities along the x- and y-directions;

3. Results and Discussion

C

We check our approach ﬁrstly by examining R0 with that of no-slip (Kn= 0) approach. This
can be done easily once we consider terms of Dy(y) and
(y) because to evaluate R0 we shall at
most take into account the higher derivatives of φ(y), like φyy(y), φyyy(y) instead of φy(y) and
escape from the prescribing of a2.
Our numerical calculations conﬁrm that the mean streamwise velocity distribution (averaged over
time) due to the induced motion by the wavy elastic vacuum-matter interface in the case of free
y2). R0
(vacuum) pumping is dominated by R0 (or Kn) and the parabolic distribution
which deﬁnes the boundary value of Dy has its origin in the y-gradient of the ﬁrst-order streamwise
velocity distribution, as can be seen in Eqn. (14).
In addition to the terms mentioned above, there is a perturbation term which varies across the
channel :

To compare with no-slip (Kn= 0) results, we plot three cases, α = 0.1, 0.4, and 0.8 for the same
Reynolds number Re = 1 of our results : Kn= 0.1 with those Kn= 0 into Fig. 2. We remind
the readers that the Reynolds number here is based on the wave speed. This ﬁgure conﬁrms our
approaches since we can recover no-slip results by checking curves of Kn= 0 and ﬁnding them
being almost completely matched in-between. The physical trend herein is also the same as those

– 8 –

reported in Refs. (Kogan 1969; Einzel & Parpia 1997) for the slip-ﬂow eﬀects. The slip produces
decoupling with the inertia of the wavy interface.
Now, let us deﬁne a critical reﬂux condition as one for which the mean velocity U (Y ) equals to
zero at the center-line Y = 0 (cf. Fig. 2). With equations (12,20-21), we have

Π0cr = Re(

which means the critical reﬂux condition is reached when Π0 has above value. Pumping against
a positive (unit) body forcing greater than the critical value would result in a backward transport
(reﬂux) in the central region of the stream. This critical value depends on α, Re, and Kn. There
will be no reﬂux if the (unit) body forcing or pressure gradient is smaller than this Π0. Thus, for
some Π0 values less than Π0cr , the matter (ﬂow) will keep moving or evolving forward. On the
contrary, parts of the matter (ﬂow) will move or evolve backward if Π0 > Π0cr . This result could be
similar to that in (Chu 2005) using diﬀerent approach or qualitatively related to that of ( ˇStefanˇci´c
2004) : even for very slow growth of Λ, the gravitationally bound systems become unbound while
the nongravitationally bound systems remain bound for certain parameters deﬁned in ( ˇStefanˇci´c
2004) (e.g., η).
We present some of the values of Π0(α, Re; Kn = 0, 0.1) corresponding ot freezed or zero-volume-
1
−1 U (Y )dY = 0) in Table 1 where the wave number (α) has the range between
ﬂow-rate states (
R
0.20 and 0.80; the Reynolds number (Re)= 0.1, 1, 10, 100. We observe that as Kn increases from
zero to 0.1, the critical Π0 or time-averaged (unit) body forcing decreases signiﬁcantly. For the same
Kn, once Re is larger than 10, critical reﬂux values Π0 drop rapidly and the wave-modulation eﬀect
(due to α) appears. The latter observation might be interpreted as the strong coupling between
the vacuum-matter interface and the inertia of the streaming matter-ﬂow. The illustration of the
velocity ﬁelds for those zero-ﬂux (zero-volume-ﬂow-rate) or freezed states are shown in Figure 3.
There are three wave numbers : α = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8. The Reynolds number is 10. Both no-slip and slip
(Kn=0.1) cases are presented. The arrows for slip cases are schematic and represent the direction
of positive and negative velocity ﬁelds.
Some remarks could be made about these states : the matter or universe being freezed in the
time-averaged sense for speciﬁc dissipations (in terms of Reynolds number which is the ratio of
wave-inertia and viscous eﬀects) and wave numbers (due to the wavy vacuum-interface or vacuum
ﬂuctuations) for either no-slip and slip cases. This particular result might also be related to a
changing cosmological term (growing or decaying slowly) or the critical density mentioned in Refs.
(Comelli et al. 2003). If we treat the (unit) body forcing as the pressure gradient, then for the
same transport direction (say, positive x-direction), the negative pressure (either downsdtream or
upstream) will, at least, occur once the time-averaged ﬂow (the maximum speed of the matter (gas)
appears at the center-line) is moving forward! For example, for Π0 = Re( ∂p
10 < 0 (Re =
10, α = 0.2), the velocity ﬁeld (proﬁle) is shown in Fig. 4. One possible p-pair for uniform (negative)
xupstream > 0 :
gradient (mean value theorem): pdownstream
pdownstream < 0, pdownstream < pupstream < 0.
Meanwhile, the time-averaged transport induced by the wavy interface is proportional to the square

of the amplitude ratio (although the small amplitude waves being presumed), as can be seen in
Eqn. (12) or (20), which is qualitatively the same as that presented in (Borman et al. 1987; Chu
2002) for analogous interfacial problems. In brief summary, the time-averaged entrained transport
(pattern, either moving forward or backword and there is possibility : freezing) due to the wavy
vacuum-matter interface is mainly tuned by the (unit) body forcing or Π0 for ﬁxed Re. Meanwhile,
Π0cr depends strongly on the Knudsen number (Kn, a rarefaction measure) instead of Re or α. We
hope that in the future we can investigate other issues like the role of phase transition and that of
cyclic universes (Lara & Castagnino 2005; Chu 2005) using the present or more advanced approach.

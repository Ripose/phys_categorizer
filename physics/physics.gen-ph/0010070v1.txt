Abstract

Quantum Gravity is quite elusive at the experimental level; thus a
lot of interest has been raised by recent searches for quantum gravity
eﬀects in the propagation of light from distant sources, like gamma
ray bursters and active galactic nuclei, and also in earth-based inter-
ferometers, like those used for gravitational wave detection. Here we
describe a simple heuristic picture of the quantum ﬂuctuations of the
gravitational ﬁeld that we have proposed recently, and show how to
use it to estimate quantum gravity eﬀects in interferometers.

1 Introduction

The propagation of light in random or ﬂuctuating media has long been used
as a probe of their statistical properties [1]. This holds true also for exotic
media like the background of gravitational waves in the space between the
earth and some faraway light source [2, 3, 4] (see ﬁgure 1).

Recently several authors have proposed searches for quantum gravity ef-
fects in the propagation of light over cosmological distances or in earth-based
interferometers; for instance, according to Ellis, Mavromatos and Nanopou-
los [5], the vacuum of quantum gravity should be dispersive and this should

Figure 1: In addition to atmospheric scintillation we expect scintillation eﬀects
due to the background of gravitational waves that aﬀect starlight as it travels to
the earth. The light emitted by a star does not travel in a straight line, but is
scattered by this background: therefore it displays angular displacement and the
time of arrival ﬂuctuates randomly.

show up as an energy-dependent spread in the arrival times of energetic pho-
tons from distant sources like gamma-ray bursters, active galactic nuclei, and
gamma-ray pulsars. This opens up interesting observational opportunities for
experimentalists (see, e.g. [6, 7]), but requires either a violation of Lorentz
invariance or of the equivalence principle [8].

The proposal [5] is based on the latest developments of D-brane theory,
and it is yet another picture of the “space-time foam” ﬁrst proposed by
Wheeler in 1957 [9], and later considered by other authors such as Hawking
[10].

Here we propose a heuristic treatment of these background ﬂuctuations,
which is based on the direct use of the uncertainty principle for energy and
time, with additional assumptions on the dynamic and statistical behaviour
of the resulting quantum ﬂuctuations. Afterwards we use this model to
evaluate the spectral properties of the ﬂuctuations of the energy density and
of the gravitational potential, and to derive the behaviour of light in a generic
two-arm interferometer.

P. Bergmann [2] originally suggested to search for low-frequency com-
ponents of gravitational waves by attempting to detect ﬂuctuations in the
intensity of light, but actually most searches for this eﬀect have been carried

out looking for ﬂuctuations in the arrival times of pulses from millisecond
pulsars and other such sources. See [3] for the details of how one such search
is performed, and [4] for a recent review.

2 Fluctuations of the

gravitational energy density

We consider now a single quantum ﬂuctuation of the vacuum energy density
and assume that it is uniformly spread over a spherical region, then the total
energy associated with the ﬂuctuation is

E =

4πR3
0

ρ,

(1)

where R0 is the radius of the bubble. We assume that the bubble expands
at the speed of light, so that R0 = ct, where t is the time of creation of
the bubble, and that it satisﬁes the time-energy uncertainty principle at all
times2, so that E ≈ ¯ht, and therefore we ﬁnd

ρ ≈

3¯h
4πc3t4 .

(2)

It is also important to note that the expanding bubbles are just a represen-
tation of the light cones in 3-space, therefore they are Lorentz invariant, i.e.,
they would look the same in any other Lorentz-boosted reference frame. A
rough form of Lorentz invariance is thus present in our model, whose causal
structure is compatible with a relativistic model of spacetime, and these ﬂuc-
tuations satisfy the requirement, ﬁrst discussed by Zeldovich [12], that the
quantum vacuum must indeed be Lorentz invariant.

Now let n (~x, t) be the number density of the ﬂuctuations that occur in
spacetime, i.e., n (~x, t) dV dt ﬂuctuations are created in a small space-time
volume dV dt at position ~x and time t, and assume that n (~x, t) dV dt is a
Poisson variate with average n0dV dt and variance n0dV dt (see ﬁg. 2); then
the average density observed at (~x0, t) and due to the ﬂuctuations created at

2Quantum mechanics enters this simple model only by way of the uncertainty principle,
but it does so “peacefully”, and coexists with relativistic invariance in a rather natural
way.

Figure 2: a. We picture the ﬂuctuations of the gravitational energy density
as “bubbles” that expand at the speed of light, and are uniformly ﬁlled with a
decreasing energy density that satisﬁes at all times the time-energy uncertainty
principle; b. an observer sees the whole of space seething with bubbles, whose
number density in a given space-time volume follows a simple Poisson statistics.
More pictures and simulations of these ﬂuctuations can be found on the web [11].

Then the total energy density observed at (~x0, t) and due to all the prior
ﬂuctuations in the light-cone of the observer is given by

where T0 is the age of the Universe, and rmin, rmax are the minimum and
the maximum distance from the observer. Furthermore in (4) we have
dropped the ~x dependence, because we assume translational invariance. The
maximum distance can be taken to be the present radius of the Universe
rmax ≈ c/H, while the minimum radius corresponds to the smallest bubble
that can possibly be observed, that is that bubble that emerges from a “mini

which is just the Planck length. Thus eq. (4) gives an average density

It is worthwhile to notice that a minimum and a maximum scale show up nat-
urally in the calculations, and that the total energy density (7) is seamlessly
related to both the micro and the macrostructure of the Universe.

The same formalism can be used to estimate the variance of the energy

density ﬂuctuations, and proceeding as before one ﬁnds

It is also important to notice that the average energy density (7) contributes
to the eﬀective cosmological constant [13]:

recent observations favour a nonzero and positive cosmological constant [14,
15] such that ΩΛ ≈ 0.7 and Λ = 3ΩΛH 2/c2; this means that we can use (9)
to estimate the order of magnitude of the free parameter n0, if we assume
that most of the eﬀective cosmological constant is due to the ﬂuctuations
considered here:

3 Fluctuations of the gravitational potential

Since we assume that ﬂuctuations spread with the speed of light, there can
be no gravitational potential outside the bubble, because for an external
observer there is no way to know that it exists, while inside the bubble we
assume that the gravitational potential is just the (Newtonian) potential of
a sphere of uniform energy density ρ:

4 Correlation functions

A somewhat more complicated integration yields the correlation function of
the gravitational potential:

where the shorthand notation r1,2 = |~x1,2 − ~x| has been used,

t⋆ = min (t1 − r1/c, t2 − r2/c)

and S is the range of acceptable values of ~x1,2 — i.e., values such that rmin <
r1,2 < rmax.

The expression (14) can be calculated for diﬀerent special cases, e.g., the

time correlation function at a given space point is

5 Irradiance ﬂuctuations

In the weak ﬁeld approximation the frequency of light is linearly related to
the gravitational potential

therefore, using the correlation function (14), one ﬁnds that the time cor-
relation function for the irradiance ﬂuctuations in a two-arm interferometer
is

where ℓ1,2 is the position along the path L1,2, ν0 is the frequency of light in
a zero-potential region, I1,2 is the irradiance of light along each path, and ϕ0
is the average phase diﬀerence.

We plan to complete the calculation of the time correlation function (18)

for speciﬁc interferometer designs in the near future.

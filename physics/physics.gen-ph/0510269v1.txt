Abstract

Scenarios of supersymmetry breaking at various scales from TeV to GUT to the
string are generated. A previous analysis generated the value of the experimentally
measured cosmological constant from supersymmetry breaking at the TeV scale. Via
a reorganization of the perturbative series, values of the cosmological constant are
generically reconcilable with supersymmetry breaking scenarios having scales from
the TeV on up to the string. The scenario with only a single supersymmetry breaking
scale occurs at the GUT scale, generically.

Introduction

The cosmological constant has been assumed to be zero for the prior three
decades, due possibly to the origins of the work in supersymmetry breaking. However,
recent astrophysical data indicate that it has a small value, and subsequently there
have been many attempts to model its value in string theory and in quantum ﬁeld
theory. In fact the value ﬁts the indicative formula [1],

Λ8

with Λ approximately the TeV scale (e.g. 1 − 2 TeV). This formula, and its origin,
is not emphasized much in the literature. There is also an approximate hierarchy to
the mass patterns [2] of the fundamental fermions following from

also with Λ of the order of a TeV (and mpl = 1.2 × 1028), and n an integer (the next
order correction is presented in [2]). The origin of these formulae could be explained
with supersymmetry breaking at a TeV, however, diﬀerent energies should be more
natural given the diﬀerent scales reﬂected in geometry.

The nature of the formulae to the patterns of the fundamental masses require
a deeper explanation [2], possibly in supersymmetry breaking [3],[4]. In this regard,
the supersymmetry breaking with diﬀering higher energy scales is relevant to the
parameters listed in (1) and (2), and also to realistic model building. In addition the
perturbation theory should be included.

The scenario adopted in [1] uses a supersymmetry breaking involving eight dif-
ferent scales, Λ1 to Λ8. Due to the fact that in theory upon three or more scales set
to zero the cosmological constant equals zero (D-terms in N = 2 models allow for a
classical cosmological constant), the functional form of the cosmological constant has
to be

and in the work of [1] the scales are taken to be of the TeV scale. A generalization of
this work to encompass the string scale, as well as energies between the TeV and the
string scale, is relevant to both particle physics phenomenology and cosmology.

’Natural’ Value

The perturbative series expansion contributing to the cosmological density is

V (Λ) =

bnΛ4(

)n ,

X

Λ2
m2
pl

(4)

with the scale Λ in accordance with a supersymmetry breaking scale. For the moment,
all supersymmetry breaking scales are taken to be identical and equal to Λ. The
coeﬃcients bn are determined by the loop expansion. This expansion generically
produces a V (Λ) which is 1056 greater than the observed value, if the TeV scale is
chosen for Λ.

A re-ordering of the perturbative series can be easily implemented. For example,

the ﬁrst two terms in the series are grouped in the manner,

b0Λ4 + b1Λ6/m2

pl + . . . = c0Λ2m2

pl (e

−c1Λ2/m2

pl − 1) + . . . ,

(5)

so that the expansion of the exponential generates (4). The remainder terms are
altered in accordance to agree with (4); they may also be written in terms of expo-
nentials. This rewriting of the series can be done to any order of accuracy.

Physically, there is no reason a priori to suspect that either the form in (4) or (5)
is more physical, aside from the physical meaning of the exponential which could be
interpreted as an instanton-like eﬀect.

The cosmological data is next used to determined the value of Λ. The powers of

the scale breaking are determined by Λ = 10x, and e10 = 104.34, as

8.68(x − 28) + 2x + 56 = −8

10.7x = 179 .

In the units of this paper, the ’accepted’ value of the observed cosmological constant
is 10−8. This calculation results in the scale of supersymmetry breaking being

x = 15.5

Λ = 1016.7 .

(6)

(7)

The factors of 100 to 1000 in the coeﬃcients c0 and c1 change little the x value
(16−17). The scale of Λ is the Grand Uniﬁed Theory (GUT) scale. This is interesting,
as a supersymmetry breaking scale at the GUT scale will generate the currently
’accepted’ non-vanishing value of the cosmological constant.

The next term in the series has the value,

Λ8

pl

∼ 10136−112 = 1018

(8)

and is 28 orders of magnitude too large. Another exponential rewriting can be per-
formed to lower its value in accordance with the previous two terms. Then there is a
∼ 10−22. Otherwise, ﬁne tuning of the coeﬃcient b2 is
relative suppression of Λ2/m2
pl
required to an accuracy of 28 digits. The Λ10/m4
pl term is of order 103 and requires
exponention; this term can be packaged with the previous one.

In comparison, the following terms are shown to be irrelevant (to this accuracy)
in either case, with reordering or without reordering of the series (4). The term
Λ12/m8

pl = 10−20 for x = 17, and subsequent ones are of smaller value.

In eﬀect, the rewriting of the perturbative series in the form (5) naturally predicts
a scale of 1016−17, the GUT scale, for the supersymmetry breaking. This prediction
is very stable under perturbations of the coeﬃcients bn.

Two Scales

Various degrees of supersymmetry breaking are expected to happen at diﬀerent
scales. The multiple scale scenario can generate breakings at the string scale combined
with breaking at the TeV scale. These cases are considered next. The predictions are
interesting in that it straightforward to obtain scales in the GeV range on up to the
string energy.

First consider the scenario of two scales Λ1 and Λ2. In the absence of a potential
allowable D-term, which contributes at the classical level a term Λ6/m2
pl, the cosmo-
logical constant should vanish upon taking the scales to zero. This means that in the
termwise, taking Λ1 → 0 or Λ2 → 0, the function to V (Λ1, Λ2) must go to zero. For
this, the function is modeled by,

V = b0(Λ1Λ2)2 + b1(Λ1Λ2)3/m2

pl + . . . .

(9)

The expansion in (9) depends on there being two scales, and it is indicative of the
two scale supersymmetry breaking scenario.

The reordering of the series in (9) can be done in a couple of ways. The ﬁrst one

considered, and with Λ2 > Λ1, follows by rewriting the ﬁrst two terms as,

c1Λ1Λ2m2

pl(e

−c2Λ2

1/m2

pl − 1) .

(10)

Consider the case when Λ2 = Λ2

1. The eﬀects of the exponent are, with Λ1 = 10x,

8.68(x − 28) + 3x + 56 = −8

11.68x = 179

(11)

and generates,

x = 15.3 .

(12)

This is unphysical as the lower scale is an the order of a 1000 TeV, but the higher
scale is at 1030 eV, which is higher than the string scale.

The next possibility is use the higher scale in the exponent. This results in the

numbers,

8.68(2x − 28) + 3x + 56 = −8

x = 9.1 .

(13)

In this case, supersymmetry breaking occurs at a 1 GeV and at the approximate GUT
scale (1018).

The ﬁnal two scale scenario considered uses the exponential,

−λ1λ2/m2
e

pl ,

and results in the numbers,

4.34(x − 28) + 4.34(2x − 28) + 3x + 56 = −8

or,

16x = 179

x = 11.2 .

The supersymmetry breakings are near a TeV and at also at the string scale.

The two scale scenario shows that it is possible to obtain, with the rewriting of
the series, supersymmetry breaking at very diﬀerent scales. Namely, it is possible to
obtain the two breaking such that one is near the TeV scale, or in the 100 GeV scale,
and the other is near the string scale, or in the GUT scale regime. This happens with
a realistic prediction of the cosmological constant.

It should be noted that the higher order terms, such as Λ8/m4
exponentiated. The higher order terms in the case of Λ = 1011 are,

(17)

(18)

(19)

The ﬁrst and second terms requires the exponentation, as the ﬁrst is 28 orders of
magnitude too big, and the remaining terms are in agreeement with the 10−8, the
’accepted’ observed value of the cosmological constant in these units.

Three Scales

The supersymmetry breaking with three scales also has some ambiguity in the
rewriting of the perturbative series, and allows for much space between the energy
scales. Consider the series for V (Λi) of the form,

4

Xi=1

Xi=1

V (Λi) = b0

Λ1Λ2Λ3Λi + b1(Λ1Λ2Λ3)2/m2

pl + . . . ,

(20)

with Λ3 > Λ2 > Λ1.

Upon rewriting the ﬁrst two terms as

c0Λ3Λim2

pl (e

−c1Λ1Λ2/m2

pl − 1) ,

(21)

the counting of the exponents with i = 3 (the largest contribution) generates with
Λi = 10xi,

2x3 + 56 + 4.34(x1 − 28) + 4.34(x2 − 28) = −8 .

(22)

This equation is not ambiguous, but gives a scale relation between the Λi. Note that
the form in (21) does not have the quartet term matching, but rather is a bound

6

because the largest symmetry breaking scale Λ3 is used; a factor of three in the
coeﬃcient c0 absorbs this, but other forms may also be used.

Consider the example of x1 = 12 (Λ = 1012) and x2 = x3 = x. The relevant

numbers are,

6.34x = 127

x = 20 .

(23)

In this case Λ1 = 1012 which is the TeV scale, and two more closer to the string
scale at Λ2 = Λ3 = 1020. The latter should be spaced a bit as three scales are being
considered.

The second scenario is

4

Xi=1

c0Λ1Λim2

pl (e

−c1Λ2Λ3/m2

pl − 1) ,

(24)

the counting of the exponents with i = 3 (the largest contribution) generates,

x1 + x3 + 56 + 4.34(x2 − 28) + 4.34(x3 − 28) = −8 .

(25)

Again, the quartet term can be bounded by a factor of three due to the choice of
exponentiation. With the same breaking, x1 = 12 and x2 = x3 = x, the numbers are,

9.68x = 167

x = 17 .

(26)

The three scales are then at the TeV scale together with another two at the GUT
scale. There is considerable ﬂexibility though in the examples, when two of the scales
are not chosen together.

To demonstrate the ﬂexibility consider the ﬁnal example, with x1 = 12 and

x3 = 3

2x2. Take the ﬁrst rewriting in the previous, and the numbers are

12.4x2 = 167

x2 = 14 .

(27)

In this case, Λ1 = 1012, Λ2 = 1014, and Λ3 = 1021. The scales are at a TeV, the GUT
energy, and also at the string scale. Again, there is much freedom in arranging the
scales, and there are potentially other interesting cases.

7

In the previous examples, the higher order terms must also be arranged in expo-
nential form in order to not spoil the value of the cosmological constant. It is clear,
however, that scenarious with various scales of disparate supersymmetry breaking
and that are realistic, may be obtained. This is without ﬁne-tuning, and without any
real model speciﬁcity, unless actual values of the supersymmetry breaking are used.

Conclusion

The cosmological constant problem is typically very diﬃcult to solve without some
ﬁne-tuning. However, it is possible to use a simple ’rearrangement’ of the perturbative
series to obtain realistic values, at least in accord with the current supernovae data.

The simplest scenario, requiring only one supersymmetry breaking scale, indi-
cates that with the current ’accepted’ value of the cosmological constant, that the
supersymmetry breaking is at the scale of 1016−17 eV. This is interesting for a variety
of reasons, not only because the prediction is generic, but also due to the one-loop
coupling uniﬁcation of the standard model at this scale.

More interesting scenarios of supersymmetry breaking can be achieved if the
models possess more than one scale. Three or four scales can be used in a direct
fashion to obtain supersymmetry breaking at the TeV scale, the GUT scale, and
the string scale, in one model. The typical ﬁne-tuning problem of supersymmetry
breaking is compounded many fold with supersymmetry breaking at the string scale.
This work shows that no real ﬁne-tuning is required even with scales of supersymmetry
breaking located near the string as well as in current phenomenological experiments.

The dynamical origin of the possible running of the scales would be interesting

to further understand due to the perturbative series used in this work.

Abstract

Observation of the decay of muons produced in the Earth’s atmosphere by cosmic
ray interactions provides a graphic illustration of the counter-intuitive space-time
predictions of special relativity theory. Muons at rest in the atomsphere decay-
ing simultaneously are subject to a universal time-dilatation eﬀect when viewed
from a moving frame and so are also observed to decay simultaneously in all such
frames, whereas the decays of muons with diﬀerent proper frames show relativity of
simultaneity when observed from diﬀerent inertial frames.

Introduction

The present paper is the seventh in a recent series devoted to space-time physics, writ-
ten by the present author, and posted on the arXiv preprint server. In Ref. [1] the classical
‘Rockets-and-String’
[2] and ‘Pole-and-Barn’ [3] paradoxes of special relativity were re-
analysed taking into account the distinction between the real and apparent1 positions
of uniformly moving objects. Diﬀerent results were obtained from the usual text-book
interpretations of these experiments and a new causality-violating paradox was pointed
out. This paradox, as well as the related ‘backwards running clocks’ one of Soni [4],
was resolved in Ref. [5] where, in order to avoid these paradoxes as well as manifest
breakdown of translational invariance, in some applications of the standard space-time
Lorentz transformation, the use of a ‘local’ Lorentz transformation.
i.e. one where the
transformed event in the moving frame lies at the coordinate origin in this frame, was
advocated. When this is done the closely correlated ‘relativity of simultaneity’ (RS) and
‘length contraction’ (LC) eﬀects of conventional special relativity theory do not occur.
The connection between these eﬀects is explained in Ref. [1]. Ref. [5] also contains a ‘mini
review’ of all experimental tests of special relativity where it is pointed out that, whereas
time dilatation is well-conﬁrmed experimentally, no experimental evidence exists for the
RS and LC eﬀects.
[6] and [7] it is explained how the spurious
RS and LC eﬀects result from a misuse of the time symbols in the standard space-time
Lorentz transformation. Ref. [7] presents the argument in a pedagogical manner, whereas
Ref. [6] contains a brief ‘executive summary’ of it. In Ref. [8] it is shown that the absence
of the conventional RS eﬀect follows directly from the Reciprocity Postulate [9, 10], that
holds in both Galilean and special relativity, without invoking the Galilean or Lorentz
transformations. As discussed in Ref. [11] mis-use of the standard space-time Lorentz
transformation in classical electrodynamics leads to incorrect relativistic derivations, in
particular of the classical (pre-relativistic) Heaviside formula [12] for the ﬁelds of a uni-
formly moving charge, which is no longer valid in relativistic classical electrodynamics. In
Ref. [13], Einstein’s classic train/embankment experiment [14], used in many text books
to demonstrate the RS eﬀect before introducing the Lorentz transformation, is reanalysed
and a conclusion –the absence of any RS eﬀect– contrary to that of Einstein, is found.
However a genuine ‘relativity of simultaneity’ eﬀect is predicted by special relativity in
the case that observers in two trains of suitably chosen speeds. as well as an embankment
observer are considered. The main aim of the present paper is to present a conceptually
similar, but simpler, demonstration of this RS eﬀect (quite distinct from the text-book
one derived by incorrect use of the Lorentz transformation) by considering the decay of
muons at rest in diﬀerent inertial frames.

In the later papers

In the following section the necessary formulae for the analysis of the muon decay

thought experiment –essentially the prediction of a universal time dilatation eﬀect– are
derived from ﬁrst principles. Here there is considerable overlap with work presented in
[6] and [7]. The analysis of the thought experiment presented in Section 3 shows both

the absence of the spurious text-book RS eﬀect (muons which decay simultaneously in a
common proper frame, are observed to do so in all inertial frames) as well as a genuine

1i.e. as naively predicted by the the standard space-time Lorentz transformation

relativistic RS eﬀect when the observation of the decays of muons at rest in diﬀerent
inertial frames is considered.

2 Operational meaning of the space-time Lorentz trans-
formation: Rates and spatial separations of moving
clocks

The Lorentz transformation (LT) relates observations (x,y,z,t) of the coordinates of
space-time events in one inertial frame S, to observations of the coordinates (x′,y′,z′,t′)
of the same events in another inertial frame S’. As is conventional, the Cartesian spatial
coordinate axes of the two frames are parallel, and the origin of the frame S’ moves with
constant speed, v, along the x-axis. In any actual experiment, times are recorded by clocks
and positions speciﬁed by marks on ﬁxed rulers (or their equivalent). Therefore, in order
to relate the space-time coordinates appearing in the LT to actual physical measurements
they must be identiﬁed with clock readings and length interval measurements. This can
be done in two distinct ways depending on whether the experimenter observing the clocks
and performing the length measurements is at rest in S or in S’. In the former case (only
events with spatial coordinates along the x-axis are considered so that y = y′ = z = z′ =
0) the appropriate LT is:

and in the latter case is:

In these equations βv ≡
(2.1) and (2.2) the transformed events lie on the worldline of a clock, C’, at rest in S’,
which is observed from S. The observed time in S registered by C’( which is in motion in
this frame) is t′, while τ is the time registered by a clock, C, identical to C’, but at rest
in S. In contrast, in (3) and (4) the transformed events lie on the worldline of C, which is
observed from S’. The time t is that registered by C as observed from S’ and τ ′ is the time
registered by C’ as observed in its own proper frame. Thus two experiments are possible
involving one stationary and one moving clock, depending on whether the experimenter
performing the space and time measurements is in the rest frame of one, or the other, of
the two clocks. To describe both of these experiments, the four diﬀerent time symbols, τ ,
τ ′, t and t′, with diﬀerent operational meanings, are required.

In order to derive predictions, without introducing any speciﬁc spatial coordinate
system, it is convenient to introduce invariant interval relations [15] that may be derived
directly from (2.1) and (2.2) or (2.3) and (2.4):

(2.5) connects diﬀerent events on the worldline of C’, (2.6) diﬀerent events on the worldline
of C. Since C’ is at rest in S’, ∆x′ = 0, while the equation of motion of C’ in S is ∆x = v∆τ .
Substituting these values in (2.5) and using the deﬁnition of γv, gives:

∆τ = γv∆t′

∆τ ′ = γv∆t

Similarly, since C is at rest in S, ∆x = 0, and the equation of motion of C in S’ is
∆x′ =

v∆τ ′. Hence (2.6) yields the relation:

−

(2.7) and (2.8) are expressions of the relativistic Time Dilatation (TD) eﬀect in the two
‘reciprocal’ experiments that may be preformed using the clocks C and C’. They show
that, according, to the LT, ‘moving clocks run slow’ in a universal manner (no spatial
coordinates appear in (2.7) and (2.8)). In fact:

To discuss measurements of the spatial separations of moving clocks, at least two
clocks, (say, CA′ and CB′ , at rest in S’) must be considered.
It is assumed that they
lie along the x′-axis separated by the distance L′. It will be convenient to introduce two
further identical clocks CA and CB at rest in S at such a separation that when the x-
coordinates of CA and CA′ coincide, so do those of CB and CB′ . Further suppose that
all the clocks are ﬁrst stopped (i.e. no longer register time) and are set to zero. They
are then all restarted at the instant that CA and CA′ as well as CB and CB′ have the
same x-coordinates. Such a procedure has been introduced by Mansouri and Sexl [16]
and termed ‘system external clock sychronisation’. In this case, the time intervals in (2.7)
τ etc. Also the space-like
and (2.8) may be replaced by registered clock times: ∆τ
invariant interval relation connecting arbitary points on the wordlines of CA′ and CB′ may
be written as:

After the ‘external synchronisation’ procedure (2.7) may be written: τ (CA) = γvt′(CA′)
and τ (CB) = γvt′(CB′) for the clocks CA′ and CB′ respectively. Then, if τ (CB) = τ (CA),
necessarily t′(CB′) = t′(CA′) and (2.11) simpliﬁes to:

The measured spatial separation of the clocks is therefore a Lorentz invariant quantity [17]

eﬀect. Also, since τ (CB) = τ (CA) requires that also t′(CB′) = t′(CA′) there is here no
‘relativity of simultaneity’ eﬀect either. How these correlated, spurious, eﬀects arise from
misinterpretation of meaning of the time symbols in the LT is explained elsewhere [5, 6,
7, 8]. A genuine relativity of simultaneity eﬀect arising in observations of muon decays,
occuring in diﬀerent inertial frames, is, however, described in the following section. The
clocks A’, A and B, discussed in an abstract fashion above, are physically realised by
introducing the muons µA′ , µA and µB . Each muon constitutes an independent clock
whose proper time, T , is signalled in an arbitary inertial frame by observation of the muon
decay event: µ

3 Muons are clocks that demonstrate time dilatation

and relativity of simultaneity

Muon decays constitute an excellent laboratory for testing the predictions of special
relativity. For example, the TD eﬀect of Eqn(2.7) was experimentally conﬁrmed at the
per mille level of relative precision in the ultrarelativisic domain (γv ≃
30) by observation
of the decay of muons in the storage ring of the last CERN muon g
2 experiment [18].
−
In the present paper, it is shown that thought experiments involving muons provide a
graphic illustration of the predicted space-time behaviour, in special relativity, of clocks
in diﬀerent inertial frames.

Unlike most other unstable particles, muons are particularly suitable for precise tests
of the TD eﬀect because of the ease of their production from pion decay and long mean
lifetime of 2.2 µs. The former yields high events statistics and the latter the possiblity of
precise time interval measurements using accurate clocks in the laboratory frame [18].

The thought experiment developed in the present paper is an elaboration of the well-
known demonstration that the very presence of cosmic muons at the Earth’s surface is,
by itself, suﬃcient to demonstrate the existence of the TD eﬀect [19, 20, 21, 22]. Muons
are produced predominantly by the weak decay of charged pions π±
µ±ν. The velocity
of the muon, vµ, depends upon that of the parent muon, vπ, and the centre-of-mass decay
angle, θ⋆. If the pion has the same velocity, v⋆
µ), as the muon in
the pion rest frame, (corresponding to a pion momentum of 49.5 MeV/c) and cos θ⋆ =
1,
the muon is produced at rest in the laboratory system. The maximum muon decay energy
Emax
correponds to cos θ⋆ = 1 and is given, in terms of the parent pion energy Eπ, and
µ
the pion velocity vπ = cβπ, by the relation:

cosmic protons, that produce the parent pions of cosmic muons, occur at high altitude,

decaying, when the TD eﬀect is taken into account.

In the thought experiment considered here it is assumed that two muons µA and µA′
are produced simultaneously at the same point A (see Fig.1a) by decay of pions from a
primary cosmic ray interaction with the nucleus of a gas atom of the atmosphere. The
muon µA is produced at rest in the atmosphere (inertial frame S) while µA′ is produced
with velocity v = cβv = √3/2, so that γv = 2. It happens that both muons decay after
time T in their proper frames. Because of the TD eﬀect, the muon µA′ will then be seen
by an observer at rest in the atmosphere to decay after time τ = γvT = 2T at a point
B at a distance L = 2T v = 2.28km from A. It is also supposed that at the same time,
τ = 0, that µA and µA′ are created another muon, µB , (also with proper decay lifetime
T ) is created at rest in the atmosphere at the point B, by decay of pion from another
primary cosmic ray interaction. This is highly unlikely, but not impossible. Since µA and
µB are at rest in the atomsphere and have no TD eﬀect they will decay simultaneously at
τ = T (Fig.1b) in the frame S. At this instant the muon µA′ is still undecayed and is at
the point M, midway between A and B, When µA′ decays (Fig.1c) µA and µB no longer
exist, however the centres of mass of their, by now distant, decay products e, ν and ¯ν still
remain at the points A and B.

The sequence of events that would be seen by an observer in the rest frame, S’, of µA′
is shown in Fig.2. In S’, µA and µB move to the left with velocity v. The conﬁguation
at τ = τ ′ = 0 is shown in Fig.2a. At time τ ′ = T = L/(2v) (Fig.2b) µA′ decays when it
has the same x′ coordinate as the point M. The muons µA and µB are still undecayed. At
time τ ′ = γvT = L/v (Fig.2c) µA and µB are observed to decay simultaneously. At this
time A’(the centre of mass of the µA′ decay products) has the same x-coordinate as the
point B in the atmosphere. Note that µA and µB are observed to decay simultaneously in
S’ as well as in S. In fact their decays will be observed to be simultaneous in any inertial
frame. In this case, there is no RS eﬀect as predicted by a conventional (but incorrect)
text book application of the LT [5, 6, 7, 8].

Finally, in Fig.3, is shown the same sequence of muon decay events as they would
be seen by an observer at rest in the frame S” that is moving parallel to the direction
of motion of µA′ with velocity w = c2(γv −
1)/(vγv) relative to the atmosphere. In S”,
µA′ moves with speed w in one direction, while µA and µB move with speed w in the
opposite one (see Fig.3a). Since the TD eﬀect is now the same for all three muons they
will observed from S” to decay simultaneously at the time τ ′′ = γwT = 0.613L/v as shown
in Fig.3b.

The muon decay events thus exhibit a genuine ‘relativity of simultaneity’ eﬀect. The
simultaneous decays of µA and µB in their proper frame S (ﬁg.1b) are also seen to be
simultaneous in the frames S’ (Fig.2c) and S” (Fig.3b). However, the decay times τD, τ ′

A similar pattern of events is seen in a variant of Einstein’s train/embankment thought

Table 1 shows the decay times and relative spatial separations of the muons µA′ and
µB (or the centres of mass of their decay products) in the frames S (the atmosphere, or
the proper frame of µB ), S’ (the µA′ proper frame) and S” (a frame moving with velocity

Inspection of, and reﬂection upon, Figs.1-3 shows behaviour greatly at variance with
intuition derived from Galilean space-time. The same muon decay events appear dif-
ferently ordered in time and at diﬀerent spatial separations depending on the frame of
observation. These eﬀects are the space-time analogues of the distortions produced by
linear perspective in visual perception. Just as the latter are unique for every observer,
so the former are unique to every diﬀerent inertial frame.

A particular problem about special kind of two light pulses propagation
has been considered in cases of inertial motion, constant homogeneous gravi-
tation ﬁeld and progressive non-inertial motion with constant acceleration. A
contradiction between the causality principle and relativity theory has been
revealed.

1. Introduction
It is well-known that two Einstein’s postulates form a basis of special theory

of relativity (STR):

In order to overcome the restrictions, ref.

1. All inertial reference frames are equivalent to each other.
2. A light velocity in vacuum does not depend on a velocity of emitter.
At present time one can see some restrictions on application of these pos-
tulates. For example, the second postulate formally is not valid in arbitrary
[1] proposes a rel-
co-ordinates.
ativistic postulate in the following short form: a geometry of empty physical
space-time is pseudo-Euclidean. Indeed, such a postulate allows to operate with
any arbi-trary co-ordinates of inertial reference frames and additionally includes
into STR a case of non-inertial motion. The latter statement follows from the
obvious fact that any arbitrary motion does not inﬂuence on a properties of
geometry of physical space-time, it continues to be pseudo-Euclidean. (From
a formal point of view it means that the curvature tensor is equal to zero in
both inertial and non-inertial frames). According to the author’s opinion, such
a formulation of relativistic postulate allows to deeper understand a physical
essence of relativity theory. For example, it allows to advance a problem about
correspondence of STR to the causality principle. At the ﬁrst sight, this prob-
lem seems to be trivial due to a ﬁniteness of light velocity in STR. Nevertheless,
the present paper ﬁnds some additional questions in this topic in the following
particular physical problem.

2. A special case of two light pulses propagation: in inertial ref-
erence frame, in constant homogeneous gravitation ﬁeld, and in rigid
non-inertial frame

2.1. Case of inertial motion
Let us consider the following problem in Cartezian inertial reference frame.
Let a short light pulse be emitted from the point x = 0 along the axis
x. Let a number of re-emitters of light RLm be located along the x-axis in

1

some points xm (RL0 is located in the point x = 0 and, for simplicity, all
xm are equal to each other). When a light pulse arrives at each
∆xm = xm+1 −
re-emitter, it is absorbed by it, and after a ﬁxed interval of its own time ∆τ0 is
emitted by RL along the x-axis again.

Further, let the second light pulse be emitted from the point x = 0 at
such moment of time (taken as t = 0), when the ﬁrst light pulse has a coordinate

≤

x1.

0 < ∆x
One requires to ﬁnd the times t1 and t2, where t1 is the moment of time
when the ﬁrst (right) light pulse is emitted by RLn, while t2 is the moment of
time when the second (left) pulse is reaching RLn, and n is some number.

Due to the condition (1), the most general expression for t1 can be

written as
t1 = tx1

is it possible to implement the equality
t1 = 0? It is obvious, such an equality would mean an absolute event: a

t2 −
meeting of both light pulses considered in the spatial point xm.

This problem has a trivial solution in inertial reference frame. Here
tm = t′m, ∆tm = ∆t′m, and all ∆tm are equal to each other for any m. Hence,
t1 = ∆t, and the equality of t1 and t2 is impossible. This result means that
t2 −
at the moment of time when the second (left) pulse is reaching RLn in xn point,
the ﬁrst (right) pulse already has a space coordinate xn + ∆x.

in this approximation. Substituting (7) and (5) into (4), one gets:

Hence, the equality of t1 and t2 is implemented under the condition

Thus, we conclude that for appropriate choice of the parameters in (9), we
are able to observe the absolute event: a meeting of two short light pulses in
the spatial point xn.

2.3. Case of rigid non-inertial frame
In this Section we will consider the problem in rigid non-inertial frame mov-
ing along the axis x at constant (in relativistic meaning) acceleration a, and we
will perform the exact calculations due to importance of the results obtained.

By deﬁnition, in a rigid frame the proper distance between two spatial points
(measured by means of a scale being at rest in this frame) does not de-pend on
time. Let us deﬁne such a rigid frame by the relationships [3]

α; t′ = 0; t = τ ,

xα = x′
where the primer space and time coordinates belong to successive instantane-
ously co-moving inertial reference frames, while τ stands for the proper time at
the origin of coordinates. In such deﬁnition, for the case of constant (in instanta-
neously co-moving inertial frames) acceleration a along the axis x, a relationship
between space-time coordinates in a ﬁxed inertial reference frame (T, X, Y, Z)
and (t, x, y, z) takes the form [3]:

Thus, an observer in an accelerated frame will detect the absolute event:
the left and right light pulses will meet in the point deﬁned by (23) (under
negative sign of the acceleration a). This conclusion is in agreement with the
result of Section 2.2 and the equivalence principle. However, here we meet a
quite diﬃcult problem: for observer in external inertial frame both light pulses
will never intersect.

Indeed, let the process of light pulses propagation in the accelerated
frame be observed from some inertial reference frame. Furthermore, let us
choose for observing the light pulses propagation process an inertial frame K,
such that at the time moment when an observer sees the appearance of the left
light pulse in the point x = 0, he simultaneously sees an arriving right pulse
to RL1 (such a choice is always possible due to (1)). For this time moment,
let us introduce into consideration the second inertial frame Ks shifted along
the axis x at such a distance (with respect to K) which is equal to the distance
between RL0 and RL1. (The relative velocity of K and Ks is equal to zero).
Due to the space homogeneity in inertial frames, such a shift is equivalent to
re-numeration of the re-emitters in Ks: the RLm (in K) be RLm
1 (in Ks).
1 for the left pulse is exactly
Hence, the propagation time from RL0 to RLn
equal to the propagation time from RL1 to RLn for the right pulse in both K
and Ks frames (since the RL1, RLn in K are the RL0, RLn
1 in Ks). Hence, at
the moment of time (in K) when the right pulse is emitted by RLn, the left one
1 for any n. Therefore, the light pulses considered will never
is emitted by RLn
meet in the inertial frame K, that means a contradiction with the causality
principle.

Conclusions

Thus, a consistent relativistic consideration of the problem about special
kind of two light pulses propagation in a non-inertial reference frame contradicts
with the causality principle. One can show that a resolution of this contradiction

4

is possible only under supposition that a geometry of empty space-time is not
pseudo-Euclidean [4]. However, it is in a deep disagreement with the relativity
theory. It seems that a full resolution of this contradiction within the scope of
relativity theory is impossible.

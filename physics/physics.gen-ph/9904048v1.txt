Abstract

It is pointed out, that in the light of recent results on the semionic
or anomalous behaviour of electrons below the Fermi temperature, the
solid core of the earth which has been ignored so far, would contribute
signiﬁcantly to Geomagnetism and help explain the puzzling magnetic
reversals.

1 Introduction

In 1905 Albert Einstein described Geomagnetism as one of the ﬁve unsolved
problems of physics[1]. After nearly a century,
inspite of a tremendous
amount of work which has culminated in the dynamo model of Geomag-
netism, [2], it cannot be said with conﬁdence that the problem has been
solved. From time to time, simulations are developed which improve upon
earlier models[3, 4, 5], but several unexplained features persist. These in-
clude the problems of Geomagnetic reversals[6, 7, 8, 9]. In particular it may
be mentioned (cf.ref.[9] and [1])that Muller and Morris have attributed the
reversals to asteroid impacts, which in turn have been related to mass ex-
tinctions.
We will point out in what follows that in the light of recent work on semionic
and anomalous behaviour of Fermions under special conditions, the solid core
of the earth which has hitherto not been considered could contribute signif-
icantly to Geomagnetism, and could even facilitate an explanation for the
magnetic reversals.

2 Magnetism of the Solid Core

It is well known[10, 11] that the earth has a solid core with a radius of
about 1200 kilometers, composed mostly of Iron (90%) and Nickel (10%), at
a temperature of about 6000 degrees centigrade and with a relative density
around 10. This in turn is surrounded by the liquid core which it is believed
gives rise to the dynamo model of Geomagnetism.
Given the above data, using the atomic weight of iron, we can easily calculate
that the number of atoms in the solid core, N is given by,

N ≈ 1048

where the symbol ≈ denotes, ”of the order of”.
We next calculate the Fermi temperature of the conduction electrons in the
solid core. This is given by[12],

kTF =

6π2
(cid:26)

(cid:18)

N
V (cid:19)(cid:27)

2/3 ¯h2
2m

C

where V is the volume of the solid core, k is the Boltzmann constant ¯h is the
reduced Planck constant and m the electron mass.
It follows from (2) that

TF ≈ 105o
Thus one can see that the temperature of the solid core is below the Fermi
temperature of the conduction electrons.
In recent years it has been realized that under special conditions like low
dimensionality or temperatures, conduction electrons do not strictly obey
Fermi-Dirac statistics, but rather they are semionic, that is they obey statis-
tics between the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics [13, 14]. In par-
ticular, this is true below the Fermi temperature [15]. The implications are
interesting:
Given Fermi Dirac statistics, at temperatures below the Fermi temperature
we would have (cf.ref.[12]) for the magnetisation M per unit volume the
formula

(3)

where µ is the electron magnetic moment and ¯N+ is the average number of
electrons with spin up, say, where ¯N+ ≈ N
2 , so that M in (4) is very small.

M =

µ(2 ¯N+ − N)
V

However if the behaviour is not Fermionic, but rather Bosonic, then

In our case,

With this input (4) becomes,

¯N+ ≈ N

r3 ≈ 1G

From (5) we can easily deduce that the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld H is given
by,

(5)

The above order of magnetic calculation thus gives the correct order of the
terrestrial magnetism. Moreover, this would have the added advantage that it
could explain geomagnetic reversals: The semionic behaviour of the electrons
in the solid core is sensitive to external magnetic inﬂuences and could thus
ﬂip or reverse polarity. On the other hand, the explanation in the case of the
convective dynamo model would be contrived in comparison.

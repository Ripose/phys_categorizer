ON AN ELEMENTARY DERIVATION OF
THE HAMILTON-JACOBI EQUATION FROM
THE SECOND LAW OF NEWTON.

Alex Granik∗

Abstract

It is shown that for a relativistic particle moving in an electromagnetic
ﬁeld its equations of motion written in a form of the second law of Newton
can be reduced with the help of elementary operations to the Hamilton-
Jacobi equation. The derivation is based on a possibility of transforming
the equation of motion to a completely antisymmetric form. The anal-
ogous procedure is easily extended to a general relativistic motion of a
charged relativistic particle in an electromagnetic ﬁeld. It sis also shown
that the special-relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a free particle
allows one to easily demonstrate the wave-particle duality inherent to this
equation and, in addition, to obtain the operators of the four-momentum
whose eigenvalues are the classical four-momentum 03.20.+i, 03.30.+p

In analytical mechanics we arrive at Newton’s second law (the experimentally
veriﬁed phenomenological equations with the observable parameters) by postu-
lating the principle of least action. In turn, the action S obeys the Hamilton-
Jacobi equation. The latter is a partial diﬀerential equation of the ﬁrst order.
A transition from Newton’s second law to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation can be
achieved with the help of the algorithm for transforming a system of ordinary
diﬀerential equations into a partial diﬀerential equation. Despite the fact that
such transformation algorithm is well-known (e.g., [1]) the actual transformation
of the equations of motion of a charged relativistic particle in the electromag-
netic ﬁeld into a respective PDE (the Hamilton-Jacobi equation) is not quoted
in the physical literature to the best of our knowledge.The usual approach to
the problem of derivation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is to heuristically
introduce classical action S and to vary it (for ﬁxed initial and ﬁnal times).

Here we provide an elementary derivation of the Hamilton-Jacobi where the
concept of action emerges in a natural way by considering the momentum as
a function of both temporal and spatial coordinates. This can be seen by con-
sidering ﬁrst a non-relativistic classical particle moving from p.A to p.F (see

Fig.1). The particle can do that by taking any possible paths connecting these
two points. Therefore for any ﬁxed moment of time, say t = 1 the momentum
would depend on the spatial coordinate, that is ~p = ~p(~x, t). In a sense we have
replaced watching the particle evolution in time by watching the evolution of
its velocity (momentum) in space and time.This situation is analogous to the
Euler’s description of motion of a ﬂuid (an alternative to the Lagrange descrip-
tion). The other way to look at that is to consider a ”ﬂow” of an ”elemental”
path and describe its ”motion” in terms of its coordinates and velocity (deter-
mined by a slope of the path at a given point).

This allows us to represent Newton’s second law for a particle moving in a
conservative ﬁeld U (~x) as follows

One obvious solution to Eq.(4) is

similar to an irrotational motion in Euler’s picture of a ﬂuid motion.

Eq.(4) implies

curl~p = 0

~p = ∇S

where S(~x, t) is some scalar function. Generally speaking, we can choose the
negitive value of ∇S. The conventional choice is connected with the fact that
the resulting isUpon substitution of Eq.(5) into Eq.(1) we obtain with the help
of Eq.(3) the following equation

Now we can arrive at the principle of least action (without postulating it a
priori) directly from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. To this end we subject the
action S to small perturbations δS ≪ S and (by dropping the term (∇δS)2)
get from (8) the equation with respect to δS

(∇S) · (∇δS) = 0

Since ∇S/m = ~v Eq.(11) represents the substantial derivative of δS:

This means that

= 0

δS = const

To ﬁnd the value of const in (13) we consider the deﬁnition of the action S
according to (10) where it is deﬁned on a set of all possible paths connecting
point A and point F . Therefore perturbations δS correspond to perturbations
of these paths. Since at the ﬁxed points A and F the paths are also ﬁxed, this
means that their perturbations at these points are 0. But according to (13)
δS = const. Therefore δS = 0 yielding the principle of least action:

The above derivation serves as a guide for a derivation of the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation for a relativistic particle of charge q and mass m moving in the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. Our approach is to reduce the respective equations of motion to
the form which would be analogous to an irrotational motion in Euler’s picture.
The very structure of the space-time metric allows one to arrive at the required
result in a natural way.

Therefore we begin with the second law of Newton for a relativistic charged
particle of a charge q and mass m moving in the electromagnetic ﬁeld:

dpα

= q[Eα + ǫαβγvβBγ]

(15)

where Greek indices α, β, γ, ... take the values 1, 2, 3, ǫαβγ is the absolutely an-
tisymmetric tensor of the third rank, pα = mvα/(1 − vδvδ)1/2 is the momentum
of the particle, Eα is the electric ﬁeld , vα = ~v is the velocity of the particle and
Bα is the magnetic ﬁeld.

For the subsequent analysis we cast Eq.(15) into the standard co - and contra-
variant forms. To this end we use the metric gik = gik = [1, −1, −1, −1] and
In this metric x0 = x0 = t,
use units where the speed of light is c = 1.

xα = ~x = −xα, the four- potential Ai(A0, Aα) whose scalar part A0 = φ (where
φ is the scalar potential) and Aα ≡ ~A is the vector potential, and the roman
indices i, j, k ,. . . take the values 0, 1, 2, 3,. From the Maxwell equations then
follows (e.g.[2]) that the electric ﬁeld Eα intensity and the magnetic induction

Adding Eqs.(24) and (21) and using the deﬁnition of F ik, Eq.(20), we arrive at
the equation of motion in the contra-variant form:

The respective co-variant form follows from raising and lowering indices in (25):

Now we reduce these equations to a form similar to the condition deﬁning an
irrotational ﬂow in ﬂuid mechanics. To this end we rewrite (25) and (26) in the
following form

uk[

(mui + qAi) −

∂

∂xk (mui + qAi) −
and add to the third term the identity

(28)

(29)

The expressions in square brackets represent a four-curl of the four-vector mui +
qAi (or mui + qAi). Both equations are identically satisﬁed if this four-curl is 0.

Once again, this can be interpreted as the fact that the respective vector ﬁeld
is irrotational, that is the four-vector m~u + q ~A (here we use notation ~a for a
four-vector) is the four-gradient of a scalar function, say −S

This scalar function S ( a ”potential function”) is the classical relativistic ac-
tion, and our choice of the sign is dictated by the consideration that expressions
(30) must become the expressions for the momentum and energy in the non-
relativistic limit.

To ﬁnd the explicit expression for S we integrate Eq. (30) [ or (31)] and obtain:

S = −

where a and b are points on the world line of the particle, ds = (dxidxi)1/2, and
ui = dxi/ds. Expression (32) coincides ( as it should be) with the conventional
deﬁnition of the action (introduced on the basis of considerations not connected
to the second law of Newton). It is interesting to note that in a conventional
approach to the action, the term Aidxi ”cannot be ﬁxed on the basis of general
considerations alone” [2]. Here however this term is ”ﬁxed” by the very nature
of the equations of motion.

Eqs. (30) and (31) yield the determining PDE for the function S (the relativistic
Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a charged particle in the electromagnetic ﬁeld) if
we eliminate ui and ui from this equations with the help of the identity uiui = 1:

(33)

where we have to retain ( in the classical region) only one sign, either plus or
minus.1

The usual way to derive the equations of motion (25) [or (26)] from the action,
Eq.(32) is to vary it. Here we follow the well-known procedure of reducing the
integration of the partial diﬀerential equation of the ﬁrst order to the integration
1We would like to point out that a uniﬁed way to to describe wave and particle phenomena
inherent to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation ( which was the main motivation of Hamilton) is
conventionally demonstrated by comparing it and the eikonal equation and by showing that
they are identical. On the other hand, as we show in the Appendix, there exists a simple
way to do that directly from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation without resorting to the eikonal
equation.

of a system of the respective ordinary diﬀerential equations [1]. In particular,
given the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (33) we derive (25). To this end we subject
action S to small perturbations δS

S = S0 + δS

(34)

and ﬁnd the equation governing these perturbations. Here S0 must satisfy the
original unperturbed Hamilton-Jacobi equation (33) , and δS ≪ S0.

Upon substitution of (34) into (33) we get with accuracy to the ﬁrst order in

Equation (36) is a quasi-linear ﬁrst-order PDE whose characteristics are given
by the following equations

Here the repeated indices do not represent summation, and α = 1, 2, 3. It is
immediately seen that the characteristics of linearized Hamilton-Jacobi equation
(37) are the four- velocity ui:

ten in a form of the second law of Newton. To demonstrate that we divide both

This means that δS = const along a certain world line, singled out of a contin-
uous set of possible world lines according to this condition. Without any loss of
generality we can take the above const = 0.

If we apply the above condition δS = 0 to the expression of the action S, Eq.
(30), the former would ”choose” out of all possible world lines the only one
satisfying that condition, that is we arrive at the classical principle of least
action.

Finally, we demonstrate in an elementary fashion how the same technique of
transforming the equations of motion in the Newtonian form to the Hamilton-
Jacobi equation can be applied to a motion of a charged particle in general
relativity. The equations of motion of a charged particle in gravitational and
electromagnetic ﬁeld are [3].

Equation (43) is identically satisﬁed if we set

where S is the action and we use the negative sign, representing a conventional
choice of positive energies in classical mechanics. Raising and lowering the
indices in (44), expressing the respective 4-velocities uk and uk in terms of
∂S/∂xk, and using the identity gikuiuk = 1, we arrive at the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation:

gik(

We have shown that with the help of elementary operations one can arrive at
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation from the phenomenological second law of Newton,
without using of a priori deﬁned action S. The latter arises in a natural way
as a consequence of the existence of the ”irrotational” solutions to the second
law of Newton.The procedure follows from the fact that for forces determined
by the potential energy U , the second law of Newton has a symmetry which
allows us to reduce it to an antisymmetric form analogous to the form observed
in the potential ﬂow of an ideal ﬂuid. This form lends itself to the introduction
of a certain potential function (action), whose gradient represent a generalized
momentum. Upon introduction of the action back into the second law of Newton
we arrive at the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We also show in an elementary
fashion the wave-particle duality inherent in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. As
a result of this derivation we obtain the energy-momentum operators of quantum
mechanics.

Let us consider a motion of a free relativistic particle of a mass m, whose
Hamilton-Jacobi equation (30)

corresponding to the energy-momentum relation pipi = m2 of the special rela-
tivity.

On the other hand, if we introduce the function 2

( where h is some constant having the dimension of the action S) the Hamilton-
Jacobi equation (46) yields:

This equation admits the wave solution

where ki(ω, ~k) is the wave four-vector. The respective dispersion relation is

Thus, on one hand the Hamilton-Jacobi equation describes a free particle with
the momentum-energy four vector pi(E, ~p) and, on the other hand, the same
equation describes a monochromatic wave with the wave four-vector ki

Returning back to function S ( Eq.48) we obtain from(49)

Comparing Eqs.(46) and (51) we obtain the well-known relation between the
wave four-vector and the four-momentum vector:

Moreover, relation (52) allows us to reinterpret the four-momentum vector in
terms of the eigenvalues of the certain diﬀerential operators. In fact, from (49)
and (52) follows

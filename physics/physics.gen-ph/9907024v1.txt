Abstract

We examine the fractal structure of the physical universe from the large
scale to the smallest scale, including the phenomenon of fractal scaling.
This is explained in terms of a stochastic underpinning for the laws of
physics. A picture in pleasing agreement with experiment and observation
at all scales emerges, very much in the spirit of Wheeler’s ”Law Without
Law”. It is argued that our depiction of the universe is akin to a broad
brush delineation of a jagged coastline, the Compton wavelength being
comparable to the thickness of the brush strokes.

Key Words: Fractal, Universe, Planck, Hubble

Introduction

The universe is fractal and inhomogeneous on the scale of galaxies and clusters of
galaxies[1, 2]. However whether this is true at even greater scales is debatable[3].
At the other end of space scales, it appears that the dimension at the Planck
length is less than that of the embedding space[4]. Staying purely in the realm
of physics, it appears that the three dimensionality of space is valid at the scale
of the earth and the solar system[5]. Infact as Nicolis and Prigogine put it[6],
”Our physical world is no longer symbolised by the stable and periodic planetary
motions that are at the heart of classical mechanics”. Even at these scales, if
we step out of the realm of physics, the usual concepts of dimensionality are no
longer valid.
In the words of Dyson[7] ”Classical mathematics had its roots in the regular
geometric structures of Euclid and the continuing dynamic structures of Newton.
Modern mathematics began with Cantor’s Set Theory and Peano’s Set-Filling

Curve.... The same pathological strucutres that the mathematicians invented
to break loose from 19th Century naturalism turn out to be inherent in familiar
objects all around us”.
We will conﬁne ourselves strictly to the domain of physics and argue in this
condensed communication that the fractal characteristic, whether it be in the
large scale structure of the universe or in the behaviour of quarks or Planck
masses are symptomatic of an underpinning Brownian behaviour and what has
been called by Mandelbrot, scaling fractals[8].

2 The Fractal Universe

As is known the distribution of galaxies is highly inhomogeneous, displaying
at large scales, structures in the form of long ﬁlaments, chains and cellular
structures: The distribution has fractal properties[9]. though, as pointed out in
the introduction it is still debatable whether this is true at the largest scales[2,
3, 1]. Infact at large scales, the mass distribution at distance R is given by,

M (R)

([2, 3]).
It was pointed out by Sidharth and Popova that[10] this is suggestive of asymp-
totic two dimensionality of space and explains cosmological puzzles like the age
of the universe and age of stars anamoly and dark matter.
In other words the universe on a large scale resembles the Fournier or Charlier
model of the universe[8]. Physically, this had been explained by Hoyle (cf.ref.[8])
in terms of the formation of galaxies and stars by a cascading process in which
a primordeal homogeneous gaseous cloud becomes unstable and contracts and
in the process splits into ﬁve clouds of equal size and so on.
We would now like to point out that this is explained by the fact that there is a
Brownian underpinning to the above fractal structure. As noted by Mandelbrot[8],
”the most useful fractals involve chance and both their regularities and their ir-
regularities are statistical. Also the shapes described here tend to be scaling,
implying that the degree of their irregularity and / or fragmentation is identical
at all scales”. He goes on to quote Nobel Laureate Jean Perrin, to cite Brownian
motion as an example of a natural fractal.
Indeed, as is well known in the case of Brownian motion, we have the relation[11],

l√N

where R is the overall size of the system and N is the number of steps and l is
the length of a typical step.

ural consequence of a ﬂuctuational cosmology by Sidharth [12, 13]. We will
return to this point later in Section 4.
We now observe that the following relations hold:

The equations (3),(4) and (5) bear striking resemblance to the equation from
Brownian motion, (2) and tell the whole story including fractal scaling. They
also explain the low dimensional structures of galaxies and superclusters. Fur-
thermore in the ﬂuctuational cosmological scheme referred to above (cf. also
Section 4), we have,

we get, as required, v
300 kilometers per second: Rotational velocities, do
not tend to zero as one would expect from (7) for example, but rather tend to
the above constant value, thus explaining this observational puzzle.
It must also be emphasized that within this framework[13] puzzling equations
like (1) and (2) also follow as a consequence of the theory, as will be seen in
Section 4.
Thus the underlying Brownian character in the universe is brought out, con-
sistently with observed data, and this explains the observed large scale fractal
structure of the universe. However it is interesting to note that an equation like
(2) or (5) does not hold for individual stars. This is because the gravitational
force within a star is large enough to inhibit the Brownian motion.

3 Elementary Particles

Starting with the Brownian or Random Walk relation (2), we now argue that it
is possible to deduce the Dirac equation and thence a model for all fundamental
particles namely the quarks and the leptons. A step in the direction of such

3

a stochastic description for the Schrodinger and Klein- Gordon equations was
taken by Nelson, Gaveau, De Pena and others [15, 16, 17]. While Ord[18] tried
a low dimensional formulation of the Dirac equation.
We ﬁrst observe that the Compton wavelength ¯h/mc which comes from (2) leads
to the Compton time ¯h/mc2[19, 20]. Indeed if ∆x does not tend to zero, but
∆t could, then, velocities of inﬁnite magnitude would be possible. So from (2),
using the fact that R = cT , where T is the age of the universe, we get

T = √N τ,

(8)

where τ = l/c is the pion Compton time. Equation (8) is ofcourse consistent
with data and will be deduced alternatively in Section 4. Equations (2) and
(8) show that the Compton scale is a fundamental unit of space time. Indeed
it was shown that if there is an ultimate break to the scaling, the Compton
scale emerges as this ultimate scale. This will be discussed in Section 5. One
could then easily show that quantized space time could be considered to be more
fundamental than Planck’s energy quanta[19]. Quantized space time itself has
a long history[21, 22, 23]. As T.D. Lee observes, ”space time continuum is but
an approximation.” Snyder[21] showed that discrete space time is compatible
with Special Relativity and deduced equations like

2
[x, px] = ı¯h[1 + (a/¯h)

2
x],

p

(9)

where pµ denotes the four momentum and a is the fundamental length, the
Compton wavelength in our case. We observe that as a
0, (9) leads to the
usual quantum mechanical commutation relations.
We now brieﬂy indicate how the origin of the Dirac equation lies in the equation
(9)[24, 25]. We consider a linear transformation of the wave function, under an
inﬁnitesimal coordinate shift in Minkowski space. As is well known, this gives

provides a representation for the coordinates x and t apart from any scalar
factors. Substitution of (11) in (10) now leads to the Dirac equation,

(10)

(11)

(12)

Thus we obtain a rationale for spin and the Dirac matrices in a simpler and more
physical manner. Once the Dirac equation (12) is deduced, it is well known that

(γµpµ −

the Schrodinger equation follows as a non relativistic approximation[26].
Further, at the Compton scale, the negative energy two spinor χ of the full four
rowed Dirac spinor begins to dominate. Moreover under reﬂections, χ behaves
like a psuedo-spinor[26],

that is as a density of weight n = 1, so that[27],

We can easily identify the electromagnetic four potential in (13). The fact that
n = 1 explains why the charge is discrete. We can also immediately see the
emergence of the metric tensor and the resulting potential.
We now use the fact that the metric tensor gµν resulting from (13) satisﬁes an
inhomogenous Poisson equation[28], whence

where now we require the volume of integration to be the Compton volume.
As shown elsewhere[27, 13, 29, 30], given the linearized equation of General
Relativity, (14) was the starting point of a geometrized formulation of Fermions
leading to the Kerr-Newman metric and which explains the remarkable and
supposedly coincidental fact that the Kerr-Newman metric describes the ﬁeld
of an electron including the anomalous gyro magnetic ratio g = 2.
All this was also shown to lead to a uniﬁed description of electromagnetism,
gravitation and strong interactions[29, 30].
We now show how a uniﬁed description of quarks and leptons can be obtained
from (14) and how the concept of fractal dimensioinality is tied up with it.

ρuµuν. Equation (17) can lead to a reconciliation of electromag-
where Tµν ≡
netism and strong interactions [30]. For this we need to obtain a formulation for
quarks from the above considerations. This is what we will brieﬂy recapitulate.
The doubleconnectivity or spin half of the electron leads naturally to three di-
mensional space[31], which however breaks down at Compton scales and so we
need to consider two and one dimensions. Using the well known fact that each
of the ρuıuj in (15) is given by 1
3 ǫ [14], ǫ being the energy density, it follows im-
3 e or 1
mediately that the charge would be 2
3 e in two or one dimensions, exactly
as for quarks. At the same time as we are now at the Compton scale, these
fractionally charged particles are conﬁned as is expressed by the conﬁning part
of the QCD potential (17). Further, at the Compton scale, as noted earlier we
encounter predominantly the negative energy components of the Dirac spinor
with, opposite parity. So these quarks would show neutrino type handedness,
which indeed is true.
Thus at one stroke, all the peculiar empirical characteristics of the quarks for
which as Salam had noted[32], there was no theoretical rationale, can now be
deduced from theory. We can even get the correct order of magnitude estimate
for the quark masses [30]. On the other hand neutrinos have vanishingly small
mass. So their Compton wavelength is very large and by the same argument
as above, we encounter predominantly the negative energy components of the
Dirac spinor which have opposite parity, that is the neutrinos display handed-
ness.
Thus handedness and fractional charge are intimately tied up with dimension-
ality.

4 Cosmological Considerations

We will now brieﬂy consider a ﬂuctuational cosmological scheme which leads
back to equations (1) and (2), which were so far empirical starting points. We
consider what has been called a pre universe or quantum vaccuum, which is a
Zero Point Field type of medium, of the kind used in considerations of stochas-
tic electrodynamics[17]. Such a medium was the starting point in Prigogine’s
cosmology[33, 34] and in Steady State Cosmology[14], and particles are irre-
versibly created by instability or ﬂuctuation. As Prigogine put it [34], ”The
Big Bang was an event associated with an instability within the medium that

6

produced our universe... We consider the Big Bang an irreversible process par
excellence from a pre universe that we call quantum vaccuum.”
Given N particles in the universe, at an instant, we use the well known fact that
√N particles are ﬂuctuationally created. In our case the ”instant” is ofcourse
the minimum time interval τ , the Compton time. So we have,

On integration we get (8) which was deduced from a diﬀerent viewpoint in
Section 3. By a similar argument we can deduce (2) and also [12, 13]:

where H is the Hubble Constant and m is the pion mass.
The model describes an over expanding universe, as infact latest observations
conﬁrm [35]. It deduces from the theory, the mass of the universe in terms of
microphysical parameters like the mass of the pion and Planck’s Constant[36],
since, consistently M = N m
Further equation (18) gives the correct value of the gravitational constant from
theory while (19) also deduces the Hubble constant correctly, and moreover gives
the otherwise adhoc and empirical relation between the Hubble constant and
the pion mass, which was termed mysterious by Weinberg and others. Moreover
O(H 2) [37] in
the above scheme is consistent with a cosmological constant Λ
agreement with observations. Finally the famous Large Number relations like
(2), all follow.
We next observe that the background Zero Point Field gives the correct spectral
ω3, whence from the total intensity of radiation from the
density[17], ρ(ω)
ﬂuctuating ﬁeld due to a single star it follows that over large scales the total
mass of the universe is given approximately by[13]

≤

in agreement with equation (1). So the fractal low dimensionality is a conse-
quence.
We have thus been lead in this scheme of random ﬂuctuations to our starting
point of a fractal universe as reﬂected by equations (1) and (2).

5 Discussion

As we indicated in Section 3 there is a scaling symmetry but these scaling
Infact the dynamical
fractals [8] are to be considered in a statistical sense.

origin of mass in a self similar chain was considered by Sidharth and Altaisky[5]
and it was deduced that there would be a constant, say, ¯h if scale invariance
was broken at the step lbreak given by

1/2

¯h = 2

moloc

3−2lbreak

(20)

What is very interesting here is that identifying the constant ¯h as being propor-
tional to the Planck constant, we recover from the (20) the Compton wavelength.
Beyond this however it would not be possible to probe further - indeed that
would lead to a contradiction in view of Heisenberg’s Uncertainity Principle, as
we would have to deal with arbitrarily large energies and momenta. This contra-
diction has been recognized, but Physics has lived with it[38, 13]. All this brings
us back to the Random Walk equation (2) and the quantized space time picture
described above. Indeed these minimum space time cut oﬀs are very much in
the spirit of Wheeler’s Law Without Law [39]. As he put it, ”all of Physics in
my view, will be seen someday to follow the pattern of thermodynamics and
statistical mechanics, of regularity based on chaos, of ”law without law”. Spe-
cially, I believe that everything is built higgledy-piggledy on the unpredictable
outcomes of billions upon billions of elementary quantum phenomena, and that
the laws and initial conditions of physics arise out of this chaos by the action
of a regulating principle, the discovery and proper formulation of which is the
number one task...” It may be mentioned that Wheeler’s travelling salesman
problem leads to a statistical minimum length [40] which can be shown to be
the Compton wavelength itself[19].
What we are doing here is, ﬁnding a thick brush in the spirit of the Richard-
son eﬀect of measuring a jagged coastline, which length would in the limit of
arbitrarily small lengths become inﬁnite [8]. The thickness of the brush, the
Compton wavelength is Wheeler’s or Mandelbrot’s optimum scale [8, 38].
Finally it may be mentioned that the (20) leads to the fundamental relation
(16) It is interesting to observe that in the cosmological scheme described in
Section 4, at the epoch with N
1, (16) gives the Planck mass. At that stage
all energy was gravitational as can be seen from (16) with the right side put
equal to 1. This would describe the Planck mass, which indeed is a minimum
Schwarschild Black Hole.
So the Planck particles were created in the very early epoch reminiscent of the
Prigogine cosmology. At the present epoch however we have electromagnetism
and gravitation as given by (16).

Abstract:

The structure of electrodynamics based on the variational principle to-

gether with causality and space-time homogeneity is analyzed. It is proved

that in this case the 4-potential is deﬁned uniquely. Therefore, the approach

where Maxwell equations and the Lorentz law of force are regarded as cor-

nerstones of the theory is not equivalent to the one described above.

One may regard the equations of motion of a physical system as the fun-

damental elements of a theory. Thus, the equations of motion can be used

for deriving useful formulas that describe properties of the system. How-

ever, it is now acceptable that other principles take a more profound role.

Using this approach, the variational principle, causality and homogeneity of

space-time are regarded here as the basis of the discussion.

In particular,

the fundamental equations of motion of classical electrodynamics, namely,

Maxwell equations and the Lorentz law of force can be derived from the

variational principle [1,2]. The discussion carried out here proves that in the

case of electrodynamics, the two approaches are not equivalent and that the

variational principle imposes further restrictions on the theory’s structure.

It is proved in this work that if one adheres to the variational princi-

ple together with causality and space-time homogeneity then the 4-potential

of electrodynamics is deﬁned uniquely. Therefore, in this approach, gauge

transformations are no more than useful mathematical tricks applied in a

process of solving speciﬁc problems.

The Lagrangian density used for a derivation of Maxwell equations is (see

In the present work, units where the speed of light c = 1 and ¯h = 1

are used. Thus, one kind of dimension exists and the length [L] is used for

this purpose. Greek indices run from 0 to 3. The metric is diagonal and its

entries are (1,-1,-1,-1). The symbol ,µ denotes the partial diﬀerentiation with

respect to xµ. Aµ denotes the 4-potential and F µν denotes the antisymmetric

For the simplicity of the discussion, let us examine the ﬁelds associated

with one charged particle e whose motion is given. This approach can be

justiﬁed because, due to the linearity of Maxwell equations, one ﬁnds that the

ﬁelds of a system of charges is a superposition of the ﬁelds of each individual

charge belonging to the system. Let us examine the electromagnetic ﬁelds

at a given space-time point xµ. Using Maxwell equation and the principle of

causality, one can derive the retarded Lienard-Weichert 4-potential (see [1],

pp. 160-161; [2], pp. 654-656)

Here vµ is the charge’s 4-velocity at the retarded time and Rµ is the 4-vector

from the retarded space-time point to the ﬁeld point xµ. This 4-potential

deﬁnes the ﬁelds uniquely.

A gauge transformation of (3) is (see [1], pp. 49-50; [2], pp. 220-223)

µ = Aµ + Φ,µ.

In the following lines, the form of the gauge function Φ(xµ) is investigated.

Relying on the variational principle, one ﬁnds constraints on terms of the

Lagrangian density. An examination of the Lagrangian density (1), proves

that every term of this expression is a Lorentz scalar having the dimensions

[L−4]. Thus, the action is a Lorentz scalar and is dimensionless in the unit

system used here. In particular, the 4-potential Aµ must be a 4-vector whose

dimension is [L−1]. This requirement is satisﬁed by the Lienard-Weichert 4-

potential (3). Thus, also Φ,µ of (4) is a 4-vector and Φ must be a dimensionless

Lorentz scalar function of space-time coordinates.

Now, the coordinates are entries of a 4-vector. Therefore, the general

form of a homogeneous function which is a Lorentz scalar depending on the

coordinate must be a sum of power functions of the form

fa,p(xµ) = [(xµ − xµ

a)(xµ − xaµ)]p.

(5)

Here 2p denotes the order of the homogeneous function and xµ

a denotes a

speciﬁc space-time point. Relying on the homogeneity of space-time, one

ﬁnds that in the case discussed here there is just one speciﬁc point xµ

a, which

is the retarded position of the charge. Thus, in order to be a dimensionless

Lorentz scalar, Φ must take the form

Φ(xµ) =

c1[(xµ − xµ
c2[(xµ − xµ

a)(xµ − xaµ)]p
a)(xµ − xaµ)]p = const.

(6)

Here the factors, ci denote numerical constants.

These arguments complete the proof showing that the gauge function Φ

is a constant and the gauge 4-vector Φ,µ vanishes identically. Hence, the

Lienard-Weichert 4-vector (3) is unique.

The foregoing result indicates the diﬀerence between an electrodynamic

theory where Maxwell equations and the Lorentz law of force are regarded

as the theory’s cornerstone and a theory based on the variational principle

together with causality and space-time homogeneity.

Indeed, if Maxwell

equations are the theory’s cornerstone then it is very well known that one is

free to deﬁne the gauge function Φ(xµ) of (4) (see [1], pp. 49-50; [2], pp. 220-

223). For this reason, the result of this work proves that the two approaches

are not equivalent.

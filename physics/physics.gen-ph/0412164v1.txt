AN IMMEDIATE PROOF
OF THE NON-EXISTENCE OF GW’S

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. In general relativity (GR) no observer is physically privi-
leged. As a strict consequence, it can be shown that the physical gene-
ration of gravitational waves (GW’s) is quite impossible.

1. - As it is well known, the notion of GW came forth as a by-product
of the linear approximation of GR [1]. Now, this approximation – which
resembles Maxwell e.m. theory – is fully inadequate to a proper study of
the hypothetic GW’s (see [2], [3]). On the other hand, in the exact (non-
approximate) formulation of GR no “mechanism” exists in reality for the
physical generation of the GW’s, as it can be proved [3]. The undulatory
solutions of Einstein ﬁeld equations have a mere formal character.

I give here another proof of the real non-existence of physical GW’s,
which is so straightforward that even the physicist in the street will under-
stand it.

2. - There is a radical diﬀerence between Maxwell e.m. theory and Ein-
stein general relativity: Maxwell theory is Lorentz invariant, the set of the
inertial observers is physically privileged – Einstein theory has an invariant
character with respect to all transformations of general co-ordinates, and no
observer is physically privileged [4]. All observers are on an equal physical
footing just like the inertial observers in Maxwell theory. (Strictly speaking,
in GR the concept “observer” requires a particular speciﬁcation [5]).

3. - An electric charge C which is at rest for a given inertial observer I0
cannot emit e.m. waves. Any inertial observer I for whom C is in motion
does not possess physical privileges with respect to I0. Accordingly, both
observer I0 and observer I do not register any e.m. wave sent forth by C.

In GR the expression at rest must be deﬁned precisely every time, speci-
fying the interested spacetime manifold, because the co-ordinates are mere
“labels” of point events [5]. Let us consider for instance the Einsteinian
gravitational ﬁeld generated by a homogeneous sphere of an incompressible
ﬂuid as it was investigated by Schwarzschild [6]. In Schwarzschild’s system
of co-ordinates S0 the sphere is at rest, and no GW is emitted. Now, any
observer S – very far, in particular, from observer S0 –, for whom the sphere
of ﬂuid is in motion does not possess any physical privilege with respect to

S0. Accordingly, both observer S0 and observer S do not register any GW
sent forth by the sphere of ﬂuid. It is evident that this argument can be
extended to any celestial body B, which can be considered at rest for a given
observer S0 and in motion for any observer S, who is very far, in particular,
from S0. Q.e.d. –

APPENDIX

α) I have repeatedly emphasized in my papers that the notion of GW was
originally (1916-1918) a by-product of the linearized version of the exact
(nonlinear) formulation of GR. This circumstance has unduly inﬂuenced
almost all the subsequent researches (both theoretical and experimental)
concerning the GW’s. The great majority of the physicists have considered
their existence as an obvious fact, not deserving the proof given by a real
existence theorem. Even today the overwhelming majority of the experi-
mentalists know only Einstein’s old papers [1]. The superﬁcial (and false)
analogy with Maxwell e.m.
theory has generated ruinous consequences.
Thus, since forty years the GW hunters persist in their vain eﬀorts aimed
at the experimental detection of GW’s. In the last years the inconclusive
conclusions of their papers have assumed a pathetic character of the fol-
lowing kind: – No gravitational wave was observed; however, the search
provided us with an encouraging upper limit on the gravity wave strain at
our apparatuses. –

β) I reproduce here the abstract and the third paragraph of the Introduc-
tion of a recent paper by S.D. Mohanty, Sz. M´arka, et alii, entitled “Search
algorithm for a gravitational wave signal in association with Gamma Ray
Burst GRB030329 using the LIGO detectors” [7]. The abstract is as fol-
lows: “One of the brightest Gamma Ray Burst ever recorded, GRB030329,
occurred [on 29 March 2003] during the second science run of the LIGO
detectors. At that time, both interferometers at the Hanford, WA LIGO
site were in lock and acquiring data. The data collected from the two Han-
ford detectors was [sic!] analyzed for the presence of a gravitational wave
signal associated with this GRB. This paper presents a detailed description
of the search algorithm implemented in the current analysis.” And the third
paragraph of the Introduction tells us that: “The search algorithm is the
component which acts on pre-processed data and produces a list of candidate
events or the value of a statistics which is then used in drawing a statistical
inference. A ﬁrst version of a full analysis pipeline was reported in Mohanty
S.D. et al. 2004 Class. Quantum Grav. 21 S765-S774 and the pipeline used
for the present analysis will be described in LIGO Science Collaboration:
Abbott B. et al. 2004 To be submitted.”

Now, a report on INTERNET (13 January 2004) by the second author of
the above paper (Sz. M´arka) has informed us that “We did not observe a
gravity burst, which can be associated with GRB030329.” Any comment is
superﬂuous. –

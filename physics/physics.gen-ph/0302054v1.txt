Energy

Abstract

We consider two situatiions that can be modeled by oscillators.
First we show that the universe itself is a normal mode of Planck
scale oscillators. Next we show that a background Zero Point Field
or dark energy can be modeled by electromagnetic oscillators. This in
turn leads to an observable “ﬂuctuational” current in a solenoid.

1 Planck Scale Oscillators

In an earlier communication [1], it was argued that a typical elementary
particle like a pion could be considered to be the result of 1040 evanescent
Planck scale particles. The argument was based on random motions and also
on the modiﬁcation to the Uncertainity Principle. We will now consider the
problem from a totally diﬀerent point of view, which not only reconﬁrms the
above result, but also enables an elegant extension to the case of the entire
universe itself.
We ﬁrst consider an array of N particles, spaced a distance ∆x apart, which
behave like oscillators, that is as if they were connected by springs. We then
have [2, 3]

We now identify the particles with Planck masses, set ∆x
a = lP , the
Planck length. It may be immediately observed that use of (3) and (2) gives
mP c2, which ofcourse agrees with the temperature of a black hole of
kBT
Planck mass. Indeed Rosen had shown that a Planck mass particle at the
Planck scale can be considered to be a universe in itself [4].
We now use the fact alluded to that a typical elementary particle like the pion
1040 Planck masses (Cf.ref.[1]).
can be considered to be the result of N
Using this in (1), we get r
l, the pion Compton wavelength as required.
Further, using (2), (3) and (4), we get for a pion,

kBT =

= mc2,

which ofcourse is the well known formula for the Hagedorn temperature for
elementary particles like pions. In other words, this conﬁrms the conclusions
in [1], that we can treat an elementary particle as a series of some 1040 Planck
mass oscillators.
However it must be observed from (2) and (3), that while the Planck mass
gives the highest energy state, an elementary particle like the pion is in the
lowest energy state. This explains why we encounter elementary particles,
rather than Planck mass particles in nature. Infact as already noted [5, 6],
a Planck mass particle decays via the Bekenstein radiation within a Planck
10−42secs. On the other hand, the lifetime of an elementary particle
time
would be very much higher.
1080 elementary particles
Using the fact that the universe consists of n
like the pions, the question is, can we think of the universe as a collection of
10120 Planck mass oscillators? This is what we will now show. Infact if we
use equation (1) with

itself can be considered to be a normal mode of Planck scale oscillators.

In other words the universe

2 Oscillators and Dark Energy

The existence of the Zero Point Field (ZPF) was realised even by Max Planck.
In its later version it has come to be known as Quantum Vaccuum, and lately
it has been possible to identify it with the mysterious dark energy. The Zero
Point Field arises because of the fact that though classically, an oscillator
in the ground state has zero energy, Quantum Mechanically, owing to the
uncertainity principle, there is an energy ﬂuctuation about the zero energy
level.
Interestingly there have been two schools of thought. Zero Point Field, ac-
cording to Quantum theoriests is a secondary eﬀect arising from the already
present oscilaltors. However according to what has come to be known as
Stochastic Electrodynamics, the ZPF is primary, and infact Quantum Me-
chanics can be deduced therefrom. This is a chicken and egg situation.
Recently the ZPF has come into focus once again because of the observed
ever expanding, accelerating feature of the universe. In other words there is a
large scale repulsion represented by a cosmological constant Λ once invented
and then rejected by Einstein, and this cosmic repulsion could be attributed
to a mysterious all pervading dark energy, which can be identiﬁed with the
ZPF: this could be the mechanism which drives the cosmic expansion and
acceleration (Cf.ref.[7]) for a review).
Two of the earliest realisations of the ZPF were in the form of the Lamb shift
and the Casimir eﬀect.
In the case of the Lamb shift, as is well known, the motion of an orbiting
electron gets aﬀected by the background ZPF. Eﬀectively there is an addi-
tioinal ﬁeld, over and above that of the nucleus. This additional potential,
as is well known is given by [8]

The additional energy

contributes to the observed Lamb shift which is
The essential idea of the Casimir eﬀect is that the interaction between the
ZPF and matter leads to macroscopic consequences. For example if we con-
sider two parallel metallic plates in a conducting box, then we should have a
Casimir force given by [9]

1000mc/sec.

∼

where A is the area of the plates and l is the distance between them. More
generally, the Casimir force is a result of the boundedness or deviation from
a Euclidean topology of or in the Quantum Vaccuum. These Casimir forces
have been experimentally demonstrated [10, 11, 12, 13].
Returning to the ZPF as the ubiquitous dark energy, we observe that [14], a
ﬂuctuating electromagnetic ﬁeld can be modelled as an inﬁnite collection of
independent harmonic oscillators. Quantum Mechanically, the ground state
of the harmonic oscillators is described by

ψ(x) =

1/4

mω
π¯h (cid:19)

(cid:18)

e−(mω/2¯h)x2

which exhibits the probability for the oscillator to ﬂuctuate, mostly in the
region given by

An inﬁnite collection of such oscillators can be modelled by

∼

ψ(ξ1, ξ2,

) = const. exp[

· · ·

(ξ2

1 + ξ2

−

)],

· · ·

which gives the probability amplitude for an electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgu-
ration B(x, y, z), ξ1, etc. being the Fourier coeﬃcients. Finally, as a conse-
quence there is a ﬂuctuating magnetic ﬁeld given by

where l is the extent over which the ﬂuctuation is measured. Further these
ﬂuctuations typically take place within the time τ , a typical elementary par-
ticle Compton time (Cf.ref.[1]). This begs the question whether such ubiquo-
tous ﬁelds could be tapped for terrestrial applications or otherwise.

We now invoke the well known result from macroscopic physics that the
current in a coil is given by

where N is the numer of turns of the coil, A is its area and R the resistance.
Introducing (6) into (7) we deduce that a coil in the ZPF would have a
ﬂuctuating electric current given by

In principle it should be possible to harness the current (8). While this
current is small, if we have a superconductor, then R would be very small
and the current would be much larger. The question is, whether such an
application is possible, on the earth or in an orbiting space craft, for example.
Finally, it may be remarked that the usual ZPF of Quantum Theory leads to
an unduly large cosmological constant [15]. However, in the model described
in [5, 7], we get the observed small cosmological constant.

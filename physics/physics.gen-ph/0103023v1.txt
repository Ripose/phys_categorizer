We propose a formalism which makes the chaos to be quan-
tized. Quantum mechanical equation is derived for describing
the chaos for a particle moving in electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Consider a particle of charge q and mass m moving
a electromagnetic ﬁeld. Suppose the particle revolves
about a nucleus and runs into a chaos state. It is con-
venient to consider the bunch of its paths to be a ﬂow
characterized by a 4-velocity ﬁeld u(x1, x2, x3, x4 = ict)
in a Cartesian coordinate system (in a laboratory frame
of reference). The particle will be aﬀected by the 4-force
due to in electromagnetic interaction. According to rel-
ativistic Newton’s second law, the motion of the particle
satisﬁes the following governing equations

duµ
dτ

= qFµν uν

m
uµuµ = −c2

where Fµν is the 4-curl of electromagnetic vector poten-
tial A. Since the reference frame is a Cartesian coordinate
system whose axes are orthogonal to one another, there is
no distinction between covariant and contravariant com-
ponents, only subscripts need be used. Here and below,
summation over twice repeated indices is implied in all
case, Greek indices will take on the values 1,2,3,4, and
regarding the mass m as a constant. Eq.(1) and Eq.(2)
stand at every point for the particle in the ﬁeld. As is
mentioned above, the 4-velocity u can be regarded as a
4-velocity vector ﬁeld, then

duµ
dτ

=

∂uµ
∂xν

∂xν
∂τ

= uν∂ν uµ

qFµν uν = quν(∂µAν − ∂νAµ)

Substituting them back into Eq.(1), and re-arranging
their terms, we obtain

uν∂ν(muµ + qAµ) = uν∂µ(qAν )

we have

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν) − uν∂µ(muν)

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν) −

∂µ(muνuν)

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν) −

∂µ(−mc2)

= uν∂µ(muν + qAν)

Using the notation

Kµν = ∂µ(muν + qAν ) − ∂ν(muµ + qAµ)

(6)

Eq.(5) is given by

uνKµν = 0

(9)

Because Kµν contains the variables ∂µuν, ∂µAν , ∂νuµ
and ∂νAµ which are independent from uν, then a solution
satisfying Eq.(7) is of

Kµν = 0

∂µ(muν + qAν ) = ∂ν(muµ + qAµ)

The above equation allows us introduce a potential func-
tion Φ in mathematics, further set Φ = −i¯h ln ψ, we ob-
tain a very important equation

(muµ + qAµ)ψ = −i¯h∂µψ

(10)

We think it as an extended form of the relativistic New-
ton’s second law in terms of 4-velocity ﬁeld. ψ repre-
senting the wave nature may be a complex mathematical
function, its physical meanings will be determined from
experiments after the introduction of the Planck’s con-
stant ¯h.

Multiplying the two sides of the following familiar

equation by ψ

− m2c4 = m2uµuµ

(11)

which stands at every points in the 4-velocity ﬁeld, and
using Eq.(10), we obtain

− m2c4ψ = muµ(−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)ψ

= (−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)(muµψ) − [−i¯hψ∂µ(muµ)]
= (−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)

2ψ − [−i¯hψ∂µ(muµ)]

(12)

According to the continuity condition for the particle mo-
tion

∂µ(muµ) = 0

− m2c4ψ = (−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)2ψ

Its is known as the Klein-Gordon equation.

On the condition of non-relativity, the Schrodinger
equation can be derived from the Klein-Gordon equation
[2](P.469).

However, we must admit that we are careless when
we use the continuity condition Eq.(13), because, from
Eq.(10) we obtain

∂µ(muµ) = ∂µ(−i¯h∂µ ln ψ − qAµ) = −i¯h∂µ∂µ ln ψ (15)

N = 4

where we have used the Lorentz gauge condition. Thus
from Eq.(11) to Eq.(12) we obtain

− m2c4ψ = (−i¯h∂µ − qAµ)2ψ + ¯h2ψ∂µ∂µ ln ψ

(16)

This is of a perfect wave equation for describing accu-
rately the motion of the particle. In other wards, The
Klein-Gordon equation is ill for using the mistaken con-
tinuity condition Eq.(13). Comparing with the Dirac
equation result, we ﬁnd that the last term of Eq.(16)
corresponds to the spin eﬀect of particle. In the follow-
ing we shall show the Dirac equation from Eq.(10) and
Eq.(11).

In general, there are many wave functions which satisfy
Eq.(10) for the particle, these functions and correspond-
ing momentum components are denoted by ψ(j)and
Pµ(j) = muµ(j), respectively, where j = 1, 2, 3, ..., N,
then Eq.(11) can be given by

0 = Pµ(j)Pµ(j)ψ2(j) + m2c4ψ2(j)

= δµν Pµ(j)ψ(j)Pν (j)ψ(j) + mc2ψ(j)mc2ψ(j)
= (δµν + δνµ)Pµ(j)ψ(j)Pν (j)ψ(j)(µ ≥ ν)

+mc2ψ(j)mc2ψ(j)

= 2δµνPµ(j)ψ(j)Pν (j)ψ(j)(µ ≥ ν)

+mc2ψ(j)mc2ψ(j)

= 2δµνδjkδjlPµ(k)ψ(k)Pν (l)ψ(l)(µ ≥ ν)

+δjkδjlmc2ψ(k)mc2ψ(l)

where δ is the Kronecker delta function,
j, k, l =
1, 2, 3, ..., N . Here, specially, we do not take j sum over;
P represents momentum, not operator. Suppose there
are two matrices a and b which satisfy

aµjkaνjl + aνjkaµjl = 2δµνδjkδjl

aµjkbjl + bjkaµjl = 0

bjkbjl = δjkδjl

then Eq.(17) can be rewritten as

0 = (aµjkaνjl + aνjkaµjl)Pµ(k)ψ(k)Pν (l)ψ(l)(µ ≥ ν)

+(aµjkbjl + bjkaµjl)Pµ(k)ψ(k)mc2ψ(l)
+bjkbjlmc2ψ(k)mc2ψ(l)

= [aµjkPµ(k)ψ(k) + bjkmc2ψ(k)]
·[aνjlPν (l)ψ(l) + bjlmc2ψ(l)]
= [aµjkPµ(k)ψ(k) + bjkmc2ψ(k)]

2

Consequently, we obtain a wave equation:

aµjkPµ(k)ψ(k) + bjkmc2ψ(k) = 0

There are many solutions for a and b which satisfy

Eq.(18-20), we select a familiar set of a and b as [2]:

(26)

where αn are the Pauli spin matrices, n = 1, 2, 3. Sub-
stituting them into Eq.(22), we obtain

[(−i¯h∂4 − qA4) + αn(−i¯h∂n − qAn) + βmc2]ψ = 0 (27)

where ψ is an one-column matrix about ψ(k). Eq.(27) is
known as the Dirac equation.

Of course, on the condition of non-relativity, the
Schrodinger equation can be derived from the Dirac equa-
tion [2](P.479).

It is noted that Eq.(27), Eq.(22), Eq.(17) and Eq.(16)
are equivalent despite they have the diﬀerent forms, be-
cause they all originate from Eq.(10) and Eq.(11).

It follows from Eq.(10) that the path of a particle is
analogous to ”lines of electric force” in 4-dimensional
space-time. In the case that the Klein-Gordon equation
stands, i.e. Eq.(13) stands, at any point, the path can
have but one direction (i.e. the local 4-velocity direction),
hence only one path can pass through each point of the
space-time. In other words, the path never intersects it-
self when it winds up itself into a cell about a nucleus.
No path originates or terminates in the space-time. But,
in general, the divergence of the 4-velocity ﬁeld does not
equal to zero, as indicated in Eq.(15), so the Dirac equa-
tion would be better than the Klein-Gordon equation in
accuracy.

The condition of the appearance of spin structure for
the chaos is that Eq.(15) is un-negligeable. The mecha-
nism profoundly accounts for the quantum wave natures
such as spin eﬀect [4] [5]. Its interpretation in physical
terms remains to be discussed further in the future.

In conclusion, in terms of the 4-velocity ﬁeld, the rela-
tivistic Newton’s second law can be rewritten as a wave
ﬁeld equation. By this discovery, the Klein-Gordon equa-
tion, Schrodinger equation and Dirac equation can be
derived from the Newtonian mechanics on diﬀerent con-
ditions, respectively. Quantum mechanical equation is
dominant in describing chaos for a particle moving in
electromagnetic ﬁeld.

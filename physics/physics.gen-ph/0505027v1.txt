Abstract

We study the eﬀects of warm water on the local penguin population.
The major ﬁnding is that it is extremely diﬃcult to induce penguins to
drink warm water. The success factor is approximately −e−iπ − 1.

2.5 Dogmatic Opinions and Objective Thoughts of the

Editor. colemana@post.queensu.ca

It was the opinion of Professor Synge in 1951 - probably until his death -, as
it is my opinion in 2005 that the evidence for the validity of Einstein’s and of
Whitehead’s theories of Gravitation is roughly of equal value. Neither Synge
nor I would claim that either is “Correct” . Certainly, Whitehead would be the
last to do so.

I refer to these theories as GRT and PR.

1

Since GRT is the dominant faith among current relativists, am I not, in
the words of Synge’s Introduction, “attempting to exhume a corpse” by men-
tioning Einstein’s and Whitehead’s Theories in the same breath? Has not our
Sacred College1 spoken, dismissing Whitehead with faint praise and a passsing
reference, in 1970?

Both PR and GRT presuppose the validity of Einstein’s Special theory(SRT ).
C.M. Will, in his discussion2 of PR, states in foot-note (3) that, as regards
theAdvance of the perihelion, the Bending of light and the Retardation of elec-
tromagnetic signals, the two theories are both within the limits of observation.
However, he also claimed , by a complicated argument concerning the local
gravitational constant, G, that he had administered the coup de grace to PR
just as, in my opinion, QM has done to GRT.

2.5.1 (i) John Lighton Synge (1897-1995)

Synge wrote 13 books and over 200 papers exemplifying the lucidity and sense
of drama that all of us who had the privilege of attending his lectures knew and
admired. Most notable perhaps were his treatises3 on Relativity: SRT in 1956,
and GRT in 1960. Although these are widely regarded as the logically clearest
available presentations of Einstein’s Theory, a careful reading of his text reveals
that he explicitly refuses to say that he considers GRT to be “correct”.

Indeed, in essence, on pp. IX/X of the Preface of his volume on GRT,
he says that while the Principle of Equivalence played a useful role in ﬁring
imagination it makes no sense and that by 1960 should have been abandoned!.
It was because Whitehead explicitly rejects this “Principle” that in 1922 he
was able to predict the solar limb-eﬀect noted by Halm in 1907.

In my senior year, 1938/9, as an undergraduaate at the University of
Toronto I had the good fortune to audit Synge’s Graduate Course on GRT. At
one point, I asked ”Sir, what do you make of Whitehead’s criticism of Einstein’s
theory of measurement?” . He brushed me aside curtly, saying “I never heard
of it!” and went on, leaving me in embarrassed silence. By 1950 , Synge and his
former co-author, Alfred Schild, were the centre of a minor revival of interest
in PR. Later, in a Public Lecture in Toronto he stated that he had become
disenchanted with GRT, my question came to his mind and he decided to look
seriously at W.’s theory. As far as I am aware he was the ﬁrst conpetent
Mathematical Physicist to do so except, possibly, Eddington.

In 1952 he invited me to give eight lectures to his seminar at theDublin
Advanced Institute to a small group which included Schroedinger - a challenging
task for a 34-year Assistant Professor! These dealt with my thesis, boldy
entitled “Relativistic Quantum Mechanics” , which was based on the late
work of Eddington about the Comstants of Nature.

2

Although I became Synge’s “walking companion” and, later, his friend ,
unfortunately I never discussed Whitehead with him since I did not learn of his
Maryland Lectures until after his death.

I feel that Synge’s Lectures are of great importance in the current discussion
about Relativity, Quantum Mechanics and the Theory of Everything. I decided
to make them more easily available.

2.5.2 (ii)

The Lectures

What follows is a Portable Latex version of a hard copy of the original
duplicated notes of Synge’s three Lectures given at the University of Maryland
in 1951. Mathematical symbols had been entered by hand so occasionally were
diﬃcult to read. There was one serious error which made two pages unintelligi-
ble. I hope, but cannot guarantee, that my revision is correct.

In three lectures it was impossible for Synge to do justice to the subtlety
of thought about space, time and matter set forth in Whitehead’s writings
on physics, beginning in 1905, with a profound essay for the Aristotelian Soci-
ety, to 1922, culminating in his three books4, The Principles of Natural Knowl-
edge(PNK), The Concept of Nature(CN), and The Principle of Relativity(PR).
Synge gives a clear elegant summary , in modern tensor notation, of the
mathematical arguments in seven of the 13 chapters of Part II of PR . But
he makes no allusion to the 4 Chapters of Part I which attempt to explain
what scientists in general and astronomers in particular mean by terms such as
“metre” or “second”. Nor did Synge have time to discuss Part III in which
Whitehead explains his use of Tensors. For me as an undergraduate , Part
III was a revelation of the real signiﬁcance of tensors and their relation to the
theory of Group Representations.

The chapters which Synge chose to discuss provide the immediate material
needed to compare the implications of PR for the tests which were advanced for
GRT and for which PR and GR are equal but he makes only a brief allusion
to PR, Ch. XIV on the Limb Eﬀect.

Synge’s discussion is correct though condensed. However, I regard it as a mis-
take of exposition that he replaced ANW’s notation, dJ2 for the“gravitational
potential” by ds2
g. It could encourage the casual reader to miss tANW’s main
criticism of GRT stated on p. 83 of PR, to which I return in in (iv) below.

I am grateful to Cathleen Synge Morawetz - Professor at the Courant In-
stitute, former President of the American Mathematical Society, Synge’s only
child and his Literary Executor - for encouraging me to complete this project in
order to spread knowledge of a little-appreciated aspect of her father’s work.

2.5.3 (iii) Alfred North Whitehead (1860 -1947)

2.5.4

ANW, as I shall refer to him , is now chieﬂy renowned as a philosopher whose
famous book5 - subtitled “An Essay in Cosmology” was the focus of the new
movement known as Process Philosophy. This occurred after 1923 when he
became a Professor at Harvard. From 1884 to 1910, his position at Trinity
College, Cambridge required him to prepare students for the Tripos in the whole
range of Pure and Applied Mathematics. Even so, in that period he created a
new branch of mathematics with his Universal Algebra6. Then with his student
, Bertrand Russell, wrote the three volume Principia Mathematica. Thoughout
this extraordinary creative period however, it seems that his favourite subject for
lectures was Maxwell’s Theory! This conﬁrms my interpretation of Whitehaed
as, at heart, a mathematical physicist attempting to understand the Universe
in all its aspects.

2.5.5 (iv) WILL’S “coup de grace”

I have not succeded in understanding Will’s argument2 so, while I have strong
reservations about its validity, I cannot say that it is incorrect. The paper
was put together during a period when Will was ﬁnishing Ph. D. studies. He
mentioned that PR is a diﬃcult theory which is not in the category of
the
“metric” theories to which the parameterized post-Newtonian( PPN) notation is
applicable. Yet it is PPN that he uses to dismiss PR. I ﬁrst became suspicious
of Will’s argument on reading his Foot- Note(10) which ascribes to Whitehead
the opposite of my understanding of Whitehead’s clear assertions.

The only responsible critical discussion of Will’s paper2 of which I am
aware is that of D.R.Fowler 7 who claimed that it contains both physical and
philosophical errors.

(a) Fowler points out that Will assumes in his critique of PR that the
mass of our Galaxy is concentrated at the centre of the Galaxy whereas, by
smearing the mass uniformily, Will’s estimate of the error predicted by PR is
reduced by a factor of 100! The force of Fowler’s argument is enhanced by the
presence of Dark Matter which was unknown when Fowler or Will wrote.

.

(b) Fowler states further that Synge and, following him, Will have quite
failed to understand the real meaning of Whitehead’s theories. Whitehead re-
marked in PR that it would be helpful to read the two previous books4 in which
he developed his concept of space and time and the role of Lorentz Transforma-
tions. Indeed, I found this essential in the sporadic sallies that I took since 1937,

4

to penetrate the thought of Whitehead re. Physics. Yet I found no reference
to CN or PNK in the writings of Synge, Will or MTW!

If Fowler is correct it would imply that PR was banished from serious
conisderation by mainstream Physics because of a paper which estimated its
discrepancy as 100 times the actual amount. This suggests the desirability of
a careful review of rhe papers of Will and of Fowler by an independent critical
study.

Whitehead stated that Einstein’s theory of measurement involves a basic in-
consistency: one does not know the meaning of “distance” between two events,
speciﬁed initially by physically meaningless co-ordinates, until Einstein’s Equa-
tions have been solved with initial conditions given in terms of “metre” and
“second” which cannot be deﬁned until the equations have been solved! I have
never seen this criticism directly addressed in the Literature of GRT. Possibly
MTW thought they did so with their cute story of the student, the ant and the
apple in the opening pages of their famous treatise. But what this story implies
is that you can give a meaning to “distance” if you are an ant (or astronomer)
who has solved the equation for geodesics - which you are unable to formulate.
Only if you are born with a God-given intuitive ability to follow geodesics in
space-time would you be able to measure anything!

This is such a clear simple inconsistency that I see no way to avoid it.

2.5.6 (v) LIMB-EFFECT

The average of frequencies of a line in the solar spectrum at extreme ends of
the equator should remove the Doppler Shift. One expects this average to
equal the frequency observed at the centre of the Disk for the same line. The
is
ﬁrst observation that this is seldom the case, now named the “limb-eﬀect”,
attributed to Halm in 1907.
I have been unable to discover anything about
Halm and would appreciate enlightenment!

IF one accepts GRT including the Strong Equivalence Principle(SSEP ) , it
follows that spectral shifts due to gravity are proportional to the frequency of
the line . Thus GRT can throw no light on the limb-eﬀect.

Synge, like Whitehead, does not accept the Equivalence Principle.
“Whitehead’s theory of relativity implies that there is an interaction between
the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds such that for an atom at the surface
of a star, the Coulomb potential r−1between two charges must be replaced by

1
r

(1 − αcos2θ).

((1))

Here, θ is the angle between the radius vector joining the two interacting
charges and the direction of the stellar radius passing through the atom; α is

5

a small constant depending on the strength of the gravitational ﬁeld. At the
surface of the sun, α = 2.12x 10−6 approximately.

The eﬀect of (1) is to perturb the normal energy levels by the term

−α

cos2 θ
r

((2))

which has axial symmetry about the stellar radius through the atom. An eﬀect
of precisely this symmetry is what is needed to explain the limb-eﬀect in the
solar spectrum. One might also hope that this perturbation could account for
the striking diﬀerences which have been observed in shifts within the same solar
multiplet.”

This long quotation is fron my 1968 paper reproduced in the Appendix to

which the reader is referred.

I am not aware of any serious attempt to explore the consequences of PR in
this connection. Yet a huge eﬀort at great expense is devoted to theories about
the solar atmosphere which are based on the GRT formula.

It has frequently been remarked that Solar Spectral shifts depend not only
on Doppler and pressure eﬀects but also on the energy levels of the terms of the
transition of which the line gives evidence. Miss Adam8 noted that shifts within
one multiplet frequently diﬀer by amounts of the order of the basic prediction
of Einstein’s formula.

I therefore propose, as a ﬁrst step in unravelling the apparent complex
confusion in observed Solar spectral shifts, that an extensive precision study be
made of shifts within single Multiplets and that an eﬀort be made to obtain a
theoretical understanding of them, using Whitehead’s formula above or other-
wise. It is conceivable but highly unlikely that the results of Adam could be
explained as a pressure eﬀect so their veriﬁcation might well sound the death
knell for SEP and even for GRT in its present form. Certainly, such would be
the case if they are explicable by the above formula of Whitehead.

This issue is highly signiﬁcant since it bears not only on our speculations
re motions in the solar atmosphere but also on all the cosmological theories for
which spectral shifts are frequently the ONLY available relevant data. It may
well happen that the α, in Whitehead’s formula (2) ,
is quite important for
small dense stars.

2.5.7 (vi) Re lativity and Quantum Mechanics

It is widely, perhaps even universally ,
recognized that the most important
unsolved problem in physics is how to reconile these two great theories or,
at least to harmonize them.
In my (dogmatic) opinion no signiﬁcant progress
has occurred since the work of Eddington in the mid 1930’s His ideas were
dismissed as “speculative” or “philosophical”. In those days ,this latter word
In fact, the ideas of Eddington were dull traditional
was the kiss of death!

physics , compared with the wild speculations and wonderful TV to which String
and M-theory have given rise.

Eddington had a very simple idea. Assume, as he did , that GRT and QM
are both correct, Choose a pproblem which can be solved by both. He
chose a ﬁnite uniform universe. Equate the two solutions leading to a relation
between
and λ This was the basic step which led him to calculate seven
Constants of Nature accurately to 1 in 104. Perhaps the stongest observational
support any Theory ever had. It was rejected immediately because it was too
one or both GRT
“philsophical” but the logical conclusion was not noticed:
and QM is/are invalid!

In the preface, to the second edition(1958) of his famous reatise on GRT ,

W. Pauli, one of tthe principal creators of QM, wrote

“ .... a clear connexion between the general theory of relativity and quantum

mechanics is not in sight.” .

In my opinion,

in the past three decade the hope of ﬁnding such a con-
nection has disappered in a murky fog created by the many conﬂicting claims
,and coounter-claims and wild speculation of proponents of Gauge, String and
M theories. An attractive counter opinion to mine can be found in the 1998
Cambridge treatise: STRING THEORY , by Joseph Polchinski or in MATH-
EMATICAL PHYSICS, 2000, Imperial College Press, the preparatory volume
for the International Mathematical Congess at Imperial College, in 2000.

I came awayfrom the Comgress , with the feeling that the ablest physics
Graduate Students were being led into wasting their minds on a misdirected
course chasing a chimera. Over beer, two very competent Cambridge Graduate
students bemoaned the fact that they had gone to Cambridge hoping to learn
some exciting Physics but were struggling with exotic mathematics with no
connection to Physics.

I taught GRT enthusiastically for eight years but am now disenchanted. It is
an all-or-nothing Theory. Whitehead is more modest. He proposed PR as a ﬁrst
step beyond Newtonian Physics taking acccount of SRT. This is what QM needs
and may well be comfortable in PR. There is need for a follow-up of Rayner’s
paper exploring the cosmological implications of PR - (cf. Rayner,1954, Proc.
Roy. Soc., London A 222, 509; and Synge, Proc.Roy. Soc., London A 226,
336)J. I assume that such has not been pursued hitherto because of the common
obsession with GRT.

she also took great interest in the Limb Eﬀect to which two of her widely
quoted papers were devoted: Mon. Notices RAS, 119, 460-470(1959) ;

shifts for various multiplets.

eﬀect were due to a perturbation proportional to the line frequency, shifts
lines of a multiplet would be equal . This is not observed.

I therefore visited the Oxford Observatory to discuss these observations
with Miss Adam. She was paarticularly keen on the observations for iron
lines since she felt that for these her results were quite reliable.

This conversation together with the fact, already noted by St John in the
twenties,
the shift depends on the excitation potential associated
with the line, redoubled my conviction that observed shifts within a ingle
multiplet could be the key to understanding the solar spectrum.

3 Synge’s Lectures

3.1 Lecture I: BASIC HYPOTHESES

3.1.1

3.1.2 1.1 Introduction

In 1922 there appeared a book by the late Professor Alfred North Whitehead
entitled The Principle of Relativity (Cambridge University Press). His book
contains a clearly formulated theory of gravitation and of electromagnetism in
a gravitational ﬁeld, and so invites comparison with Einstein’s General Theory
of Relativity which had appeared six or seven years earlier.

In attempting such a comparison, one becomes aware of certain psychological
factors. The philosophy of science, being on the whole very little discussed
among active physicists, is naive in the sense that many things are taken for
granted subconsciously. One may believe, for example, that the laws of nature,
including the ones of which we today know nothing, lie locked in blueprints in
a ﬁling cabinet, and that the achievement of the human mind in theoretical
physics is less an act of creation than a successful burglary performed on this
ﬁling cabinet.

If that view is accepted, then once the real blueprint has been exhibted to
the world, any further blueprints for the same structure brought forward at a
later date must be dismissed as forgeries. There is no room for two diﬀerent
theories covering the same phenomena; if one is right, then the other must be
wrong. That, it may be claimed, is a fair statement of a view widely, if silently,
held. It is a view very diﬃcult to dismiss from our minds, trained as they are
in an old and little-discussed tradition.

Anyone who attempts to describe Whitehead’s theory of gravitation has to
face this attitutde on the part of physicists, and if he is a physicist himself his
own thughts are not immune from it. He cannot help feeling that he may be
swimming against the tide, or (to change the metaphor) exhuming a mummy
instead of trying to contribute to the growth of the living body of physics. To
bolster his own conﬁdence, he may be tempted to create an artiﬁcial enthusiasm
as a device of propaganda in order to win a hearing for a theory which has slipped
away into a fairly complete oblivion.

There is another diﬃculty in describing Whitehead’s theory. Whitehead was
a philosopher ﬁrst and a mathematical physicist second. How can one who is
not a philosopher attempt to describe the work of a philosopher? Certainly he
cannot, if the work of the philosopher is philosophy. But if the philosophy is
only a wrapping for physical theory, then the mathematical physicist can take a
savage joy in tearing oﬀ this wrapping and showing the hard kernel of physical
theory concealed in it. Indeed there can be little doubt that the oblivion in which
this work of Whitehead lies is due in no small measure to the eﬀectiveness as

9

insulation of what a physicist can in his ignorance describe only as the jargon
of philosophy. The account of Whitehead’s theory given in these lectures is
emphatically one in which the philosophy is discarded and attention is directed
to the essential formulae. And this, it may be claimed, is as it ought to be. No
student of Newtonian mechanics should be asked to reconstruct it in the form
in which it appeared to Newton himself.

The practical physicist who lives among the facts of observation is natu-
rally impatient of theories except in so far as they assist him in understanding
those facts. He is entitled to ask, of Einstein’s theory of gravitation and of
Whitehead’s, whether they adequately explain the facts.

In the case of Einstein’s theory, the answer might be put like this: For
slowly moving bodies and weak gravitational ﬁelds, the Einstein equations yield
a close approximation to Newtonian gravitation. Since the velocities of celestial
bodies are for the most part slow (in comparison with the velocity of light) and
the gravitational ﬁelds are weak, we are to expect only minute deviations from
what is predicted by Newtonian mechanics. Three small deviations in the solar
ﬁeld are predicted and veriﬁed by observation within the limits of the errors of
observation; these are rotation of the perihelion of Mercury, deviation of a light
ray passing close to the sun, and spectral shift towards the red in a gravitational
ﬁeld.

In the case of Whitehead’s theory, all the above statements hold. By what
appears to be a rather extraordinary coincidence, there is a formal agreement
between the two theories in the matter of particle orbits and light rays, and we
ﬁnd ourselves in the strange position of having two theories which both appear
adequate on the basis of observation.

Such a situation is rather unusual in physics. The facts of observation are so
numerous that it would appear easy to ﬁnd the crucial observation which would
decide in favor of the one theory or the other, or perhaps controvert them both.
The diﬃculty here lies in the close agreement of both theories with Newtonian
mechanics, with the result that the critical diﬀerences are necessarily very small.
There is however a diﬀerence in the character of the two theories. Einstein’s
theory is based on a set of non-linear partial diﬀerential equations involving
a somewhat ill-deﬁned term, the energy tensor, and speciﬁc applications are
exceedingly diﬃcult to work out. The diﬃculties are not merely those of math-
ematical manipulation. There are deeper diﬃculties in the sense that one is
hardly convinced that certain problem are clearly formulated; thus in spite of
the ingenious manipulations used in handling the n-body problem,1 the ques-
tion remains as to whether these “bodies” are singularities in the ﬁeld, and,
if so, what is meant by a singularity in a Riemannian space with indeﬁnite
line-element.

In respect of clarity, Whitehead’s theory has much to recommend it, because
it is not a ﬁeld theory in the technical sense. The problem of n-bodies can be
unequivocally formulated, and the diﬃculties of solving it are purely mathemat-

ical. Or to take a terrestrial example, it is possible to formulate mathematically
the problem of a fast-moving particle in the presence of heavy ﬁxed masses on
the earth’s surface, a relativistic reﬁnement of the problem of geodetic obser-
vations. In fact Whitehead’s theory of gravitation has an applicabilitiy which
the General Theory of Relativity lacks by virtue of the fact that the latter is a
non-linear ﬁeld theory.

This would appear an opportune occasion to venture an expression of dis-
agreement with what may be called the “Filing-Cabinet Theory of Scientiﬁc
Theories” (as discussed earlier) and to suggest that scientiﬁc theories might be
viewed as statues or models of which there may be several representing one
thing, but deﬁnitely man-made and subject to rejection, destruction, modiﬁca-
tion and cannibalisation.

What is given in these lectures is a very free translation of Whitehead’s
theory. As indicated above, there is no attempt at all to reconstruct Whitehead’s
philosophy. I have not thought it necessary to keep his notation. But I hope
that I have not tampered with the essentials of the theory, namely, the choice
of the axiomatic formulae from which everything else follows.

3.1.3 1.2 The Minkowskian Background

The ﬁrst essential thing to observe about Whitehead’s theory is that it uses the
space-time of the Special Theory of Relativity, or, more correctly, the space-time
of Minkowski. Mathematically, this means that we consider a four-dimensional
contiuum of events and in it certain privileged systems of coordinates (x,y,z,t)
related to one another by Lorentz transformations. Given any two adjacent
events, their “separation” has a value

dx2 + dy2 + dz2 − c2dt2

independent of the particular system of coordinates used. These special co-
ordinates we may call Galileian. We shall not consider the generalisation of
Whitehead’s theory to curved space-time.

The constant c occuring above is a universal constant with a value depending
on the chosen units of space and time. We do not say here that c is the velocity
of light, since light is to be regarded as an electromagnetic phenomenon, and as
such will be discussed later.

In this Minkowskian space-time the history of a particle is a curve, as we
are accustomed to think of it in the Special Theory of Relativity. At this point
we come to the essential hypotheses of the Whitehead theory, which may be
presented as answers to the following two questions:

(a.) What is the gravitational ﬁeld due to a particle?
(b.) How does a particle move in the gravitational ﬁeld due to itself and to

other particles?

11

3.1.4 1.3 The ﬁeld due to a particle or to a set of particles and the

equations of motion

Let us use the following notation:

space coordinates xα(α = 1, 2, 3) for x, y, z

time coordinate x4 = ict.

Throughout we shall give Greek suﬃxes the range 1,2,3 and Latin suﬃxes the
range 1,2,3,4, with summation on repetition in both cases. Thus our space-
time coordinates are xr and the fundamental form, invariant under Lorentz
transformation, is

dxrdxr.

(3.1)

Except for special use of curvilinear coordinates on occasion, tensorial prop-
erties are with respect to Lorentz transformations only. In terms of the Minkowskian
coordinates xr, there is no distinction between covariant and contravariant ten-
sors; we shall in general use subscripts to indicate the components, rather than
superscripts.

For any element dxr we write

ds2 = ǫdxrdxr,

(3.2)

ǫ = 1 for space-like directions,

ǫ = −1 for time-like directions,
the sign being chosen to make ds2 positive. For a time-like element, ds is

the measure of proper time. The unit tangent vector to a world line is

λn = dxn/ds.
Consider now a time-like world line L′ (Fig.

I.1) and a point-event P which
does not lie on it. From P draw the null cone into the past, cutting L′ at P ′,
say. Let xn be the coordinates of P and x′

n those of P ′. Write for brevity

(3.3)

so that from the null property,

If L′ is straight, and if it is taken as the time axis, then λ′

α = 0, λ′

4 = i, and

w = −iξ4 = c(t − t

).

′

Thus if r is the spatial distance of P from L′, we have

r = c(t − t′) = w,

when we use the fact thatP ′P is a world line corresponding to velocity c. In
general, when L′ is not straight, the invariant w, as deﬁned in (3.11), plays the
role of “distance” of P from L′, and it is in terms of w that Whitehead deﬁnes
the gravitational ﬁeld due to a particle.

Consider now two adjacent events P and Q, with coordinates xn, and xn +
dxn, and a time-like world line L′, representing the history of a particle (Fig.
I.2).

From P and Q draw null cones into the past, intersecting L′ at P ′, Q′ re-
n + dx′
spectively, with coordinates x′

of proper time P ′Q′, which depends only on the events P, Q and the world line
L′.

(3.19)

With these formal preliminaries cleared away, we come to Whitehead’s def-
inition of the ﬁeld due to a particle of mass m and world line L′: the ﬁeld at P
is given by the tensor gmn, where gmn is symmetric and such that

gmndxmdxn = dxndn + (mk/w)ds

′2,

(3.20)

for arbitrary dxr, where ds′2 is as in (3.19)and k is a universal constant.
We recognize in mk/w the analogue of the Newtonian potential.
An equivalent expression of (3.20) is

gmn = δmn +
gmn = (mk/w3)ξmξn,

(3.21)

This “derivation” of (3.20) or (3.21) is in the old tradition of theoretical
physics, in which one seeks to lure on the reader step by step from the simple
to the complicated. This is interesting historically, because it shows how the
ﬁnal result was built up in the mind of author, but the bald fact is that (3.21)
is Whitehead’s deﬁnition of the ﬁeld due to a particle, and it must stand or fall,
irrespective of the way in which it was built up, on its merits as a predictor of
correct observational results.

The ﬁeld of one particle is then set down as in (3.21). If we have a set of
g(1)
mnmasses m(1), m(2), . . . and world lines L(1), L(2), . . ., the ﬁeld
particles with
due to them all is deﬁned to be

mn =

the notation being obvious (no summation for p).
Thus, as in Einstein’s theory, the gravitational ﬁeld appears as a symmetric
tensor gmn. But there is an important diﬀerence, because in Einstein’s theory
there is no space-time deﬁned topologically which in the gmn are functions of
position, and the gmn seem to have then the responsibility of determining the
topology. The assumption that there is no measure of separation in space-time
except gmndxmdxn leads to some oddities, for if a particle is a singularity at
which some of the gmn become inﬁnite, it may become inaccessible through

14

the inﬁnite length of world lines drawn to it. This sort of thing cannot hap-
pen in Whitehead’s theory, because the gravitational ﬁeld is displayed against
a ﬂat 4-space with Euclidean topology, and an inﬁnity in the gmn causes no
embarrassment at all (anymore than does an inﬁnite potential in Newtonian
gravitation).

We have now to supplement the hypothesis (3.22) with a further hypothe-
sis regarding the motion of particles. For this Whitehead makes a hypothesis
very like that of Einstein: The world line of a particle satisﬁes the variational
principle

where

d¯sg = 0,

d¯s2

g = −¯gmndxmdxn,

(3.23)

(3.24)

gmn which
is due to the particle itself. In fact the self-ﬁeld is omitted, just as in Newtonian
mechanics.

3.1.5 1.4 The ﬁeld of a particle at rest

If a particle exists alone in the universe, then in (3.23) we are to put

−d

s2
g = δmndxmdxn = dxndxn,

(4.1)

and from this it follows immediately that the world line is straight.

e

We seek the ﬁeld of this particle, and for this ﬁeld we shall get the simplest
expression by using special axes in space-time with the time-axis coincident with
the world line of the particle. We are then to put in (3.21)

(cf. 3.13), where r is the spatial distance of the point of observation P from
the ﬁxed particle, for which x′
α = 0. Now, m being the mass of the particle, we
have

gmn = δmn + (mk/r3)ξmξn,
and so, with Greek suﬃxes for the range 1,2,3 in accordance with our convention,

We now introduce spherical polar coordinates (Fig.I.3), so that

dxµdxµ = dr2 + r2dΩ, dΩ

This may be called the Whitehead form for the ﬁeld of a particle at rest.

Eddington (Nature 113, 192 (1924)) pointed out a remarkable fact: we can
transform the Whitehead form into the Schwarzschild form which occurs in
the General Theory of Relativity! This is certainly surprising in view of the
diﬀerence between Whitehead’s simple deﬁnition of the ﬁeld as in (3.21) and the
Einstein procedure which involves the solution of non-linear partial diﬀerential
equations.

To carry this out, let us make a transformation from (r, θ, φ, t) to (r, θ, φ, τ )

of the form

ct = cτ + f (r),

(4.9)

f being a function to be determined later. We get from (4.8)

(4.13)

which is precisely the Schwarzschild form for the solar ﬁeld, i.e. the case of
radial symmetry.

But can we satisfy (4.12)? We must remember that in the whole of space r
has the range 0 < r < ∞, and on this account a diﬃculty appears. The solution
of (4.12) is in fact discontinuous, with inﬁnite value, for r = mk, since (4.12)
gives on integration

f (r) = mk ln

+ A for r < mk,

(

4.14)

f (r) = mk ln

+ B for r > mk,

mk
mk − r
mk
r − mk

A and B being constants of integration. Thus we can carry out the transforma-
tion to the Schwarzschild form (4.13) either inside the “singularity” r = mk or
outside it, but not for both regions at the same time. Either of (4.14) makes τ
inﬁnite for r = mk.

The value r = mk corresponds to the so-called “Schwarzschild singularity”
of the General Theory of Relativity, for we shall later identify the universal
constant k with 2G/c2 where G is the constant of gravitation. We note that the
Whitehead form (4.8) is free from singularity, except of course at r = 0, where
we expect it. The Schwarzschild singularity makes its appearance through the
attempt to carry out a transformation to get rid of the product term in drdt; it
is, from the Whitehead standpoint, an artiﬁcial mathematical singularity which
it is .unnecessary to introduce. Nevertheless the value r = mk is critical in the
Whitehead Theory, as we shall see in Lecture III.

3.2.2 2.1 Equations of orbits

form, and on account of the fact that the equations of particle orbits are essen-
tially the same, viz., in our notation

Z

(1.1)

it is to be concluded that planetary orbits in the Whitehead ﬁeld of a ﬁxed
central particle are transforms of the orbits in the Schwarzschild ﬁeld. That is
in fact true, but it seems worth while to discuss the Whitehead orbits directly.
Note that for the present we are dealing with the ﬁield of a massive particle;
later we shall consider the ﬁeld of a sphere of ﬁnite size.

(1.14)

f (u) = β2/α2 − (1 − mku)/α2 − u2(1 − mku).

Since this is a cubic in u, (1.13) gives u as an elliptic function of φ, so the orbits
are determined.

To compare with Newtonian theory, we diﬀerentiate (1.13) and obtain

we may write (1.16) approximately as

d2u/dφ2 + u =

(1.17)

in which the last term is relatively very small. This is to e compared with the
Newtonian equation

d2u/dφ2 + u = Gm/h2,

(1.18)

where G is the gravitational constant, and we bring the Whitehead theory into
limiting coincidence with Newtonian theory for slow motion and weak ﬁelds by
making the following choice of the universal constant k:

k = 2G/c2.

(1.19)

3.2.3 2.2. Rotation of the perihelion

Since (1.13) and (1.14) are formally the same as the equations which occur in
the Einstein theory, we can investigate the rotation of the perihelion of an orbit
in the same way for both theories. The following seems to be simplest.

The apsides of an orbit (stationary values of r) occur for du/dφ = 0, or

equivalently f (u) = 0, where f is as in (1.14). Write

f (u) = mk(u − u1)(u − u2)(u − u3),
1
2

c2/(mG),

u1 + u2 + u3 = 1/(mk) =

this last being a large number. We identify u1 and u2 with the reciprocals of
the two apsidal distances of the orbit; then the third zero of f (u), namely u3,
is large.

By (1.13) the apsidal angle is accurately

Thus the advance of perihelion per orbital revolution is

2A − 2π =

πmk(u1 + u2) = 3πmGc

−2(u1 + u2),

(2.6)

and if we denote the semi-axis major of the orbit by a and the eccentricity by
e, so that

1/u1 = a(1 + e),
u1 + u2 = 2/a(1 − e2),

1/u2 = a(1 − e),

(2.7)

then the advance is

If, ﬁnally, we put mG = 4π2a3/t2, where t is the periodic time, we obtain the
now classical formula

2A − 2π =

6πmG
ac2(1 − e2)

.

2A − 2π =

24π3a2
c2t2(1 − e2)

(2.8)

(2.9)

This formula for the rotation of perihelion is common to Einstein’s General The-
ory of Relativity and to Whitehead’s theory of gravitation. The only diﬀerence
lies in diﬀerent interpretations of r and t, and of course these diﬀerences are
signiﬁcant in the case of planetary orbits.

3.2.4 2.3 Circular orbits

Let us discuss circular orbits in the ﬁeld of a ﬁxed particle. We have to use not
only the ﬁrst-order equation (1.13), which reads

(du/dφ)2 = β2/α2 − (1/α2)(1 − mku) − u2(1 − mku),

(3.1)

21

but also the second-order equation (1.15) obtained by diﬀerentiating it:

d2u/dφ2 =

mk/α2 − u + (3/2)mku2.

(3.2)

1
2

Proceeding without approximation, we note the presence of two constants:

an angular momentum constant

′
α = r2φ

,

and an energy constant

β = mkr

/r + (1 − mk/r)ct

,

′

′

where the prime indicates d/dsg.

Circular orbits for given α are found by putting d2u/dφ2 = 0 in (3.2); thus

the radius r = 1/u is to satisfy the quadratic equation

or, since k = 2G/c,

of which the roots are

r2 − 2α2r/(mk) + 3α2 = 0,

r2 − α2c2r/(mG) + 3α2 = 0,

r =

1
2

[

α2c2
mG

± r

α4c4
m2G2 − 12α2].

α2 ≥ 12m2G2/c4 = 3m2k2.

Thus there exists circular orbits only for values of α satisfying

So there is a lower bound for possible angular momentum in a circular orbit.

By (3.6) we also have

which tells us that

α2 =

r2
rc2
mG − 3

,

r > 3mG/c2 = (3/2)mk.

For any r satisfying this inequality there exists a circular orbit, with α2 given
by (3.9). For any α2 satisfying (3.8) there exist two circular orbits except that
for any α2 = 12m2G2/c4 there is only one, with radius r = 6mG/c2.

The general form of the graph connecting r and α for circular orbits is shown

If we use (3.3) and (3.4), with r′ = 0 in the latter, the angular velocity in a

When we substitute this in (3.11) we ﬁnd that the angular velocity in a circular
orbit satisﬁes precisely the Newtonian equation

ω2 = mG/r3.

In Whitehead’s relativity, as in Einstein’s General Theory, the concept of
force is abandoned in favor of a variational principle as in (1.1). We can how-
ever introduce it in Whitehead’s theory in a rather special way in connection
with circular orbits, by taking an analogy with Newtonian mechanics. For in
Newtonian mechanics the force per unit mass on a particle describing a circular
orbit of radius r with angular velocity admits two “deﬁnitions”:

(a) by means of angular velocity: Fω = ω2r; (b) by means of angular
momentum: Fh = h2/r3.

Since h = ωr2, we have Fω = Fh.
If we carry the analogy into Whitehead’s relativity, and use αc instead of h,

we get the following deﬁnitions:

(a) by means of angular velocity: Fω = ω2r = mG/r2 by (3.14); (b)
by means of angular momentum: Fα = α

r2 (1 − 3mG

c2r )−1.

r3 = mG

c

Thus Fω agrees with the Newtonian value, whereas Fα tends to inﬁnity as
r tends to 3mG/c2, which is the radius of the smallest possible circular orbit.

3.2.5 2.4. The gravitational ﬁeld of a sphere

Suppose we have a ﬁnite body at rest. Then, referring to (3.22) and (4.4) of
Lecture I, the ﬁeld at the point xµ is given by

gµν = δµnu + k

(4.1)

where k = 2G/c2 and the summations are over all the particles forming the body,
m′ being a typical mass, x′

where f, g, h are three functions (which we have to evaluate) and rO is the

The integral for g44 in (4.2) is of course elementary when ρ is a constant,

and thus ,the evaluation of (4.2) is complete, for we have

gµν = δµν + kρIµν ,

gµ4 = ikρIµ,

g44 = 1 − km/rO,

We have then in (4.21) the quadratic form expressing the gravitational ﬁeld
of a sphere of uniform density, at rest. It should be compared with (4.8) of

26

Lecture I, which gives the gravitational ﬁeld of a particle. We see at once that
the ﬁeld does not depend solely on the total mass (m) of the sphere, as it does in
Newtonian gravitation, for the radius a of the sphere appears in the coeﬃcients
A, B, C above. The radius does not, however, appear in the coeﬃcients of dt2 in
(4.21), and since this term is the most important dynamically, the eﬀects due to
appearance of the radius in the other coeﬃcients will be very small. We note
that A and B diﬀer from the corresponding coeﬃcients for the ﬁeld of a particle
by quantities of the order kma2r−3 and this diﬀerence is very small unless the
point of observation is close to the surface of the sphere. This is also true of C,
which has a curiously complicated form; expansion in powers of a/r gives

C =

Planetary orbits in the ﬁeld of a ﬁnite spherical sun of constant density can
of course be worked out. The method is that of Section 1, and instead of (1.13)
we ﬁnd, for u = 1/r, the diﬀerential equation

(du/dφ)2 = F (u)

where

F (u) =

It is possible also to ﬁnd the gravitational ﬁeld of a rotating sphere and
discuss the orbits of planets in this ﬁeld. In this case however retardation plays
a part, and it is necessary to have recourse to approximations which make the
work somewhat clumsy. No further account of this problem will be given here.

3.2.6 2.5. The two-body problem

In Whitehead’s theory it is possible to set up without diﬃculty the equations
governing the motion of two particles under the inﬂuence of their mutual gravita-
tional interaction. On account of the retardation involved, they are diﬀerential-
diﬀerence equations, such as one meets in the electromagnetic two-body prob-
lem.

Let L and L′ be the two world lines (Figure II.2). We take any event P on
L and any event P ′ on L′ and draw from them null cones into the past. Then

wP ′ = −(ξn)P ′ (λn)PO
(ξn)P ′ = (xn)P ′ − (xn)PO ,

[]This equation and its companion corresponding to the second of (5.8), are not
easy to handle, and anything in the nature of a “general solution” is out of
the question. However, there are two problems of special simplicity to which
attention might be given.

The ﬁrst of these problems is the quasi-Kepler problem, in which one of the
two particles is much more massive than the other. The orbit of the lighter par-
ticles approximates the Kepler orbit discussed in Sections 1 and 2. It should be
possible to push the approximation further without too great labor, particularly
if the relative velocity is assumed small.

The second problem is the symmetric two-body problem, in which not only
are the masses of the two particles assumed to be equal but a further symmetry is
imposed by suitable initial conditions- viz., as judged by some Galileian observer,
the straight line joining simultaneous positions of the two particles lies in a ﬁxed
plane and has its middle point ﬁxed. It seems likely that under these conditions
the distance between the two particles steadily increases; it would be interesting
to have a solution.

3.3 Lecture III:

ELECTROMAGNETISM

3.3.1

3. 1. The ﬁeld quantities

As always in the Whitehead theory, the background is the ﬂat space-time of
Minkowski; in it we use the imaginary time-coordinate x4 = ict. In this ﬂat
space-time there is a gravitational ﬁeld speciﬁed by gmn, but we are not now
concerned with the way in which this ﬁeld is produced– it is a given ﬁeld as far
as electromagnetism is concerned.

We shall discuss only electromagnestism in vacuo, with special references to

the propagation of light.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld is described by two skew-symmetric tensors, or

six-vectors; we shall denote them by

Fmn = −Fnm, F mn = −F nm.

(1.1)

Here the subscript-superscript notation has no particular meaning– it is simply
a notation to distinguish one set of quantities from another set, the two sets
being for the present quite unrelated.

We now make the following “physical identiﬁcation”:

F23 = B1, F31 = B2, F12 = B3( ~B = magnetic induction)
F14 = −iE1, F24 = −iE2, F34 = −iE3( ~E = electric ﬁeld strength)
F 23 = H1, F 31 = H2, F 12 = H3( ~H = magnetic ﬁeld strength)
F 14 = −iD1, F 24 = −iD2, F 34 = −iD3( ~D = dielectric displacement)

(1.2)

We may also include a 4-vector J +, with

J α = (4π/c)jα(~j = current density)
J 4 = 4πiρ(ρ = charge density)

As previously, Latin suﬃxes have the range 1, 2, 3, 4 and Greek suﬃxes the
range 1, 2, 3.

3.3.2 3.2. Maxwell’s equations

We now accept the following partial diﬀerential equations (Maxwell’s Equa-
tions):

,s = J r.
F rs
Here the comma denotes partial diﬀerentiation, and

F[mn,r] = 0,

F[mn,r] = Fmn,r + Fnr,m + Frm,n.

(1.3)

(2.1)

30

With the identiﬁcations (1.2) and (1.3), it is easy to see that these are in fact
the usual Maxwell’s equations:

F[23,1] = 0 is equivalent to div ~B = 0;

(2.2)

F[23,4] = 0, etc. are equivalent to c

3.3.3 3. Structural equations

The number of equations in (2.1) is less than the number of ﬁeld quantities (1.1)
(J τ being supposed given). To complete the system, we introduce what may be
called strucrural equations as follows, involving the gravitational ﬁeld:

These are linear equations expressing ~B and ~E in terms of ~H and ~D. If there
is no gravitational ﬁeld, then gmn = δmn, and (3.1) become

Fmn = gmrgnsF rs.

Fmn = F mn,

~B = ~H,

~D = ~E,

or

as of course is proper.

The gravitational ﬁeld plays the part of dielectric constant and magnetic
permeability, but more generally, since (3.1) does not separately express ~D in
terms of ~E and ~B in terms of ~H.

A word with regard to tensor character. In Whitehead’s theory we do not
seek invariance of form with respect to general transformations in space-time,
but only with respect to Lorentz transformations. For the Minkowskian co-
ordinates xn, the Lorentz transformation leaves dxndxn invariant, and so is
(formally) an orthogonal transformation. This implies that the transformation
laws for covariant and contravariant tensors are the same, and we do not need
the notation of subscripts and superscripts to distinguish them. Thus in gen-
eral symbols such as Amn and Amn will denote tensors unrelated to one another
except for whatever connection we may deliberately set up, just as we set up in
(3.1) a connection between Fmn and F mn.

We now deﬁne gmn by

Then (3.1) may be written equivalently

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

gmrgms = δr
s

F mn = gmrgnsFrs.

31

We may collect our formulae as follows:

We ﬁnd it convenient to introduce another tensor deﬁned by

F[mn,r] = 0, F rs

,s = J r,

F mn = gmrgnsFrs.

∗rs

F

iǫrsmnFmn,

where ǫrsmn (we may also write it ǫrsmn) is the usual permutation symbol, with
value 0 unless the suﬃxes are distinct, 1 if the suﬃxes form the set 1234 or an
even permutation thereof, -1 if the suﬃxes form an odd permutation of 1234.
Explicitly, (3.7) read

We have then identically

F[23,1] = F23,1 + F31,2 + F12,3 = −iF

∗4r
,r

with similar results for other suﬃxes, and hence the equations F[mn,r] = 0 of
(3.6) are equivalent to F ∗rs
,s = 0. Thus we may rewrite our basic equations (3.6)
in the following form, which shows only ﬁeld quantities with superscripts:

3.3.4 3.4. Geometrical optics

We consider now the propagation of electromagnetic waves (light waves), putting
J r = 0 in (3.11). However we shall pass at once to geometrical optics, using the
plans described in the lectures on Hamilton’s method. In other words, we shall
deal with the characteristics.

Plan A: We assume a solution of (3.11) of the form

F mn = Gmn exp iS, F

= H mn exp iS,

∗mn

(4.1)

where Gmn and H mn are skew-symmetric and “slowly varying”, whereas S is
“rapidly varying”. We get then, approximately,

,n = iS,nGmn exp iS, F
F mn

∗mn
,n = iS,n H mn exp iS,

(4.2)

32

and so from (3.11) we derive the system

GmnS,n = 0, H mnS,n = 0,

Gmn =

igmrgnsǫrspqH pq.

1
2

Now S = const. is the history of a phase-wave, and the partial diﬀerentiation
equation satisﬁed by S is to be found by eliminating Gmn and H mn from (4.3),
an algebraic problem. Before attempting it, let us take up a second plan.

Plan B: Now we study the propagation of a discontinuity in the ﬁeld, such
as the propagation of light into darkness. It is true that the “shock conditions”
across a discontinuity are not prescribed by the partial diﬀerential equations
(3.11), but they are suggested by them, as a limit of the continuous case.

From (3.11) (in which we put J r = 0) we have F rs

,s = 0, and so, integrating

through any region of space-time,

Hence, by Green’s theorem,

F mn

,n dV4 = 0.

F mnd

Xn

Z

Z

n is a directed element of the 3-space bounding V4. Let us now ﬂatten
where d
V4 down on a 3-space with equation S = const., and at the same time allow a
discontinuity in F mn to develop in the limit; we get then from (4.5) as shock
condition across S = const.

P

δF mnS,n = 0,
(4.6)
where δF mn represents the jump in F mn on crossing S = const. We have
n become in the limit direction ratios of the normal to
used the fact that d
S = const., and so proportional to S,n.

P

Thus, from the whole set (3.11), we get the set of shock conditions

δF mnS,n = 0,
1
2

δF mn =

∗mn

δF

S,n = 0,

igmrgnsǫrspqδF

∗pq

.

To get the partial diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by S, we have to eliminate the
quantities δF mn and δF ∗mn
, an algebraic problem precisely the same as that
involved in (4.3).

To emphasize the purely algebraic nature of our problem, let us rewrite it
in new notation: It is required to eliminate Amn and Bmn from the equations

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.7)

(4.8)

AmnTn = 0, BmnTn = 0,

Amn =

(Amn = −Amn, Bmn = −Bmn).

33

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

It may be observed that if these equations are satisﬁed with non-zero Tn,

then

det Amn = 0,

det Bmn = 0.

(4.9)

These are skew-symmetric determinants of even order, and so they are perfect
squares; in fact

det Amn =

B23B14 + B31B24 + B12B34 = 0.

so that (4.9) imply

We carry out the elimination in (4.8) in two steps. First take the case of no

gravitational ﬁeld. Then gmn = δmn and our equations read

AmnTn = 0, BmnTn = 0,

Amn =

iǫmnpqBpq.

1
2

These equations are invariant under a Lorentz transformation, if Tn transforms
as a vector and Amn and Bmn as tensors. If Tn exists (not zero in all compo-
nents), it must be space-like, time-like, or null. If it is space-like, we can choose
our frame of reference so that

T1 6= 0, T2 = T3 = T4 = 0,

(4.13)

and hence by the ﬁrst line of (4.12)

A21 = A31 = A41 = 0, B21 = B31 = B41 = 0.

(4.14)

By the last of (4.12) these imply the vanishing of all the components of Amn
and Bmn, and so we get no wave. Similarly the case of time-like Tn must be
ruled out, and we are left with the sole possibility that Tn is a null vector, so
that

TnTn = 0.

(4.15)

This, then, is the result of eliminating the A’s and B’s from (4.12).

We now return to the general case (4.8) and carry out the elimination by
a trick, using the preceding result. Consider the application of a non-singular
linear transformation, not orthogonal. Let us agree that Tn is to transform as
a covariant vector, gmn like a covariant tensor, gmn like a contravariant tensor,
and Bmn also like a contravariant tensor. If g denotes det gmn, then it is known

34

Now we know that there exists a linear transformation L(x → x′) which
makes g′mn = δmn, g′ = 1. As a result of L, (4.16) takes on the same form as
(4.12), but marked with primes. But we know that from these primed equations
we obtain, as in (4.15),

or, equivalently,

But this is an invariant equation, and so if we now apply the transformation
L−1(x′ → x) we get

This, then, is the result of eliminating the A’s and B’s from (4.18).

Restoring the original notation, we see that the phase-wave of (4.1), of the
shock wave of (4.7), is propagated according to the partial diﬀerential equation

3.3.5 3.5. Light rays

Equation (4.20) may be regarded as the tangential equation of a surface, S,n
being direction ratios of its normal. All surfaces satisfying (4.20) at an event
envelope an elementary cone having its vertex at that event (Figure III.1). To
ﬁnd the equation of the cone, we denote by ξn an elementary generator. Then
we have

and from the envelope condition,

ξnS,n = 0,

Hence

and so

by (4.20). Thus

ξnδS,n = 0,

provided gmnS,mδS,n = 0.

ξn = θgmnS,m(θ undetermined inﬁnitesimal)

gnrξnξr = θ2gmpS,mS,p = 0,

is the equation of the elementary cone.

At each event on a wave-surface S = const. there is an elementary cone
which touches this wave-surface, and the directions of tangency deﬁne space-
time curves (bicharacteristics). These curves we call rays. It follows then from
(5.3) that for some parameter u a ray satisﬁes

dxr/du = grmS,n or grndxn/du = S,r.

Hence we can derive the diﬀerential equations of a light ray. We have

3.3.6 3. 6. Light rays in the solar ﬁeld

We note that the diﬀerential equations (5.10) for a light ray agree formally
with those used in the General Theory of Relativity. Further, we have seen
that the Whitehead fundamental form for the ﬁeld of a massive particle can be
transformed into the Schwarzschild form. It is clear then that the usual formula
will be obtained for the bending of a light ray in the ﬁeld of a massive particle,
except for the reinterpretation of constants, of no physical interest on account
of the smallness of the eﬀect.

We can however open up new ground by investigating the behavior of light
rays in the ﬁeld of a ﬁnite sphere, for which we obtained the form (4.21) of
Lecture II.

For this it is more convenient to use Lagrangian equations equivalent to

(5.10). The Lagrangian is

(6.6)

{A(1 − kmu) + C2}(du/dφ)2 + Bu2(1 − kmu) = (β2/α2)B2.

(6.7)

Thus we have the equation which gives the form of the ray in space:

(du/dφ)2 = F (u),
(β2/α2)B2 − Bu2(1 − kmu)
A(1 − kmu) + C2

F (u) =

of closest approach; then F (u1) = 0, so that

3.7. Red shift in a gravitational ﬁeld The Einstein prediction of a shift
toward the red in the spectrum of an atom radiating in a gravitational ﬁeld
is based on the assumption that the ds of the General Theory of Relativity
measures proper time for the atom, in the sense that the number of vibrationas
of a certain spectral type occurring in an interval ds is a universal constant,
independent of the situation of the radiating atom. Suppose we make the same

38

assumption in the Whitehead theory viz. that measures proper time in this
sense. Then, for an atom at rest in the ﬁeld of a uniform sphere, we have by
(4.21) of Lecture II,

ds2 = (1 − km/r)c2dt2,

where r is the distance of the atom from the center of the sphere and m is the
mass of the sphere. We note that the radius of the sphere does not appear.

On the other hand, for the Schwarzschild form we have; as in (4.13) of

Lecture I,

ds2 = (1 − km/r)c2d2

(7.1)

(7.2)

By (4.9) of Lecture I we have dt, and so (7.1) and (7.2) agree. Thus if we take
the view expressed above, the red shift is the same in Whitehead’s theory as in
the General Theory of Relativity.

Actually, Whitehead used a simple model of an atom (Principle of Relativity,
Chap. XIII) and obtained a slightly diﬀerent result. And, again using a model,
he worked out the limb eﬀect. But it would seem that this, being a question
of the frequency of radiation emitted by an atom, cannot be eﬀectively handled
without a formulation in terms of quantum mechanics.

3.3.7 3.8. Wave velocity and ray velocity of light

Since, for any Galileian observer, there exists a well deﬁned spatial background,
we can in Whitehead’s theory speak of wave velocity and ray velocity of light
much more deﬁnitely than we can in the General Theory of Relativity, where
the splitting of space-time into space-like sections is a very arbitrary procedure.
Consider the history of a phase wave or shock wave with equation S = 0,
S being a function of the space-time coordinates. If we solve for t, this history
may be written

S = t − φ(x) = 0,

where x here stands for the three spatial coordinates. This wave advances in
space in the sense of φ increasing, and the unit normal in the direction of this
advance is

nρ = φ,ρ(φ,µφ,µ)

−1/2,

the comma denoting partial diﬀerentiation.
ﬁnitesimal step dxρ following the wave for a time dt is

If w is the wave velocity, an in-

dxρ = wnρdt.

But by (8.1) we have

and so the wave velocity is

dt = φ,ρdxρ = wφ,ρnρdt = w(φ,ρφ,ρ)1/2dt,

(8.1)

(8.2)

(8.4)

(8.5)

w = (φ,ρφ,ρ)

−1/2.

(8.6)

(8.7)

(8.8)

The components of normal slowness, in the sense of Hamilton, are

Now we have by (8.1)

σρ = nρ/w = φ,ρ.

S,ρ = −φ,ρ, S,4 = (ic)

and we may substitute these values in (4.20), viz. gmnS,mS,n = 0, to obtain

gµνφ,µφ,ν − 2(ic)

−1gµ4φ,µ − c

−2g44 = 0.

Substitution from (8.6) gives Hamilton’s equation, satisﬁed by the components
of normal slowness:

Ω(x, σ) = gµνσµσν + 2ic

−1gµ4σµ − c

−2g44 = 0.

(8.9)

This is the equation of the reciprocal wave surface at each point of space-time.
The wave velocity w in the spatial direction with direction cosines nρ must

then satisfy, by (8.6),

−2g44w2 − 2ic

c

−1gµ4nµw − gµνnµnν = 0,

(8.10)

a quadratic equation with the solutions

w/c = (g44)

−1[gµ4nµ ± {−(gµ4nµ)2 + g44gµνnµnν}1/2].

(8.11)

This equation appears to give two values of w corresponding to each given
normal direction nρ. But we must reject as extraneous any negative root, w
being by deﬁnition positive by (8.5).

The ray velocity is also easily found, for by (5.5) we have, for a space-time

displacement along a light ray,

gµνdxµdxν + 2igµ4dxµcdt − g44c2dt2 = 0.

(8.12)

We put dxρ = v1ρdt, v being the ray velocity and 1ρ the direction cosines of
the ray. Then v satisﬁes the quadratic equation

c2g44v

−2 − 2igµ41µcv

−1 − gµν1µ1ν = 0,

(8.13)

and so

c/v = (g44)

−1[igµ41µ ± {−(gµ41µ)2 + g44gµν1µ1ν}1/2].

(8.14)

Here also a negative value is to be rejected as extraneous.

The formulae (8.11) and (8.14) give wave velocity and ray velocity for light
in any gravitational ﬁeld. let us consider now the gravitational ﬁeld of a massive
particle at rest, so that, as in (4.4) of Lecture I, we have

gµν = δµν + kmr
g44 = 1 − km/r.

−3xµxν ,

gµ4 = ikmr

−2xµ,

gµν = δµν − kmr
g44 = 1 + km/r.

−3xµxν

gµ4 = −ikmr

−2xµ,

(8.16)

If ψw is the angle between the radius vector xρ (drawn from the massive
particle to the point of observation) and the direction nρ normal to a wave,
then xρnρ = r cos ψw and (8.11) combined with (8.16) gives

w/c = (1 + km/r)

−1[kmr

−1 cos ψw ± {1 + kmr

(8.17)

and if ψv is the angle between xρ and the direction 1ρ of a wave, we have by
(8.14) and (8.15)

c/v = (1 − km/r)

−1[−kmr

−1 cos ψv ± {1 − kmr

−1sin ψv

(8.18)

or

v/c = (1 + km/r)

−1[kmr

−1 cos ψv ± {1 − kmr

−1sin ψv

2}1/2].

(8,19)

For propagation in a radial direction, the ray direction coincides with the
wave nrmal; sinψw = sinψv = 0, and ((8.17)) is the same as (8.19) . For outward
propagation we have ψw = ψv = 0 and so, if rikm, the single value

Limb Eﬀect

(NOTE. For many years, I assumed that the paper below had appeared in
the Proceedings of the International Conference on Relativity and Gravitation
in the USSR which R. M. Erdahl and I attended in 1968 and where it was
delivered and accepted. Only in 2003, when my old interest in Whitehead’s
theory was reviving, did Prof. V. I. Yukalov inform me that the Proceedings
of the Conference were never published. AJC ).

WHITEHEAD’ S PERTURBATION OF ATOMIC ENERGY LEVELS
A. J. Coleman
Department of Mathematics, Queen’s University,
Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

Whitehead’s theory of relativity implies that there is an interaction between
the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds such that for an atom at the surface
of a star, the Coulomb potential r−1between two charges must be replaced by

Here, θ is the angle between the radius vector joining the two interacting
charges and the direction of the stellar radius passing through the atom; α is
a small constant depending on the strength of the gravitational ﬁeld. At the
surface of the sun, α = 2.12x 10−6 approximately.

The eﬀect of (1) is to perturb the normal energy levels by the small term

which has axial symmetry about the stellar radius through the atom. An eﬀect
of precisely this symmetry is what is needed to explain the limb-eﬀect in the
solar spectrum. One might also hope that this perturbation could account for
the striking diﬀerences which have been observed in shifts within the same solar
multiplet.

The eﬀect of the perturbation (2) acting between all pairs of charge is to

nucleus; 1<i, j<N , where N is the number of electrons in the atom; θi is the
angle between ri and the“vertical” ; θij is the angle between rij and the vertical.
By ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, the shift in energy of a J,M level is

∆EJM = hJM |V ‘|JM i

For a Term with total orbital momentum L and spin S ,

|JM i = Σµ+ν=M hLµSν|JM iϕLµUSν

where hLµ Sν|JMi is the vector coupling coeﬃcient, and ϕLµ and USν are,
respectively, the appropriate pure orbital and pure spin functions. Since

ccs2ϑ =

by using the indistinguishability of the electrons, the perturbation (4) can be
expressed in the form

The advantage of this decomposition is that with respect to simultaneous

AL = hϕLL|V0|ϕLLi, BJ = hJJ|V2|JJi.

It follows from the Virial Theorem that

BL = hϕLL|V2|ϕLLi.

AL = −2αEL

((13))

((14))

where E:L is the total energy of the state ϕLL which is given with suﬃcient
accuracy for the present purposes by the mean observed energy of the Term.
Thus for a Fraunhofer line, the V0 tern gives rise to a red-shift which is pro-
portional to the wavelength of the line and equal to 2/3 of that predicted by
Einstein.

We have thus reduced the problem of calculating the Whitehead shift in the
levels of a Term to that of evaluating the one constant BL. Consequently, the
shifts in the lines of a multiplet depend on two constants Bi , Bf associated
with initial and ﬁnal levels.

Dr. R M. Erdahl has suggested that in attempting to check this theory
against observations we should treat Bi and Bf as phenomenological constants.
In certain cases BJ = 0 , so that for these the predictions are particularly simple.
For example, from (13) it follows immediately that BL = 0 if L = 0, that is
for an S-term. But it follows from (12) that BJ also vanishes for states such as
4P1/2 , 6D1′2, ... 10F11/2 and many others.
It may also be worth looking at
Terns for which BJ is small.

To test the usefulness of Whitehead’s perturbation in explaining the actual
complex observations of shifts in the solar spectrum, it would be particularly
valuable to have reliable measurements for the absolute shifts at various points
in the solar disc for all lines of a multiplet and especially for multiplets which
include one or more transitions between energy levels with symmetry type ap-
pearing in the list described above.

In addition to possible perturbation of energy levels by a gravo-electric in-
teraction, the Fraunhofer lines are undoubtedly shifted by Doppler and pressure
eﬀects. To this must be added the classic Einstein shift which has been con-
ﬁrmed by the Pound-Rebka experiment and which follows from Newton’s theory
and the conservation of energy. The Einstein and Doppler shifts are proportional
to the wave-length of the line and by themselves certainly cannot explain the
observed shifts in the solar spectrum.

If Whitehead’s perturbation combined with reasonable assumptions about
pressure shift is unable to explain the observations, all is not lost. If the astron-
omers can obtain reliable observations, especially at the limb, of a large number
of multiplets of diverse symmetry, it should be possible, using the techniques of
the present paper, to obtain a good approximation for a perturbation of atomic
energy levels which would explain the observations by employing a multipole
analysis.

Since in the solar spectrum, the observed deviations from Einstein’s pre-
dicted shift are as large or larger than his prediction, it is clearly of great
interest to establish the source of this deviation in order to be able to interpret
spectral shifts from other stars with any conﬁdence.

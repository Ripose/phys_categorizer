Abstract

A heuristic approach is proposed to estimate the average speed of particles during binary
encounters by using the macroscopic variables with their extended gradient-type which are
the fundamental independent variables in extended thermodynamics theory. We also address
the missing contribution in conventional Bremsstrahlung.

Introduction

The rough approximations to the velocity of particles for a speciﬁc distribution have been a

fundamental issue in the kinetic theory of gas [1]. Normally the molecular speed varies with

the molecular weight and absolute temperature if we only consider the translation part of the

kinetic energy [2] for a gas in a uniform steady state.

We shall discuss the approximate estimate of average particle speed (in 1-D. sense, cx) from

the stationary equations of wave-breaking-like conservation laws [3-4]. The ﬂow is assumed to

be uniformly bounded and avoid the vacuum state. Since a conservation law is an integral

relation, it may be satisﬁed by functions which are not diﬀerentiable (like the discrete particle-

or molecule-based ﬂow using Boltzmann approach for dilute gas), not even continuous, merely

measurable and bounded.

We noticed that steady shocks can occur in an ideal case [5-6] or in a microscopic way [7-9]. In

this short paper, we will investigate this kind of 1D ﬂow in a heuristic way. The ﬂow ﬁeld (if in

terms of the ﬂow velocity) depends on the pressure gradient and density gradient only.

here, [ ] relates to the jump [10]; f , g can be the density and ﬂux of mass, or the density and ﬂux

of momentum, and we neglect the source-term eﬀects, e.g., body force in the momentum-balance

analogy. We assume that u has continuous ﬁrst derivatives and f , g are functions of x, t, u.

Thus, together with jump condition [10] and entropy condition for a weak solution [3,4], (1)

Let f be the density and ﬂux of mass, g be the ﬂux of mass and momentum, then we have

in the limit as the shock strength approaches zero, which is just the generalization of 1D sound

speed. Up to now, the internal energy e or the enthalpy h = e + p/ρ, which for the ideal gas is

a function of temperature alone, are still not speciﬁed yet. Besides, we neglect the viscous and

heat-conducting eﬀects in general. Thus, this kind of stationary shock can only exist either in

discrete sense [11-12] or in microscopic way (e.g., induced by molecular collisions) [9,13]. Con-

sidering the time scale of collisions, e.g., the mean collision time , since it is much shorter than

the relaxation time, so, once we neglect the high-frequency behavior or relaxation eﬀects and

only take the low-frequency limit into account, then the stationary shock concept is valid.

2.2 Application to Bremsstrahlung

The conservation equations obtained after we impose weak formulations from the integral forms

which are similar to the treatments of weak-shock problems [3] are constructed from the collision

diagram as shown in Fig. 1 with respect to the axes x and y. The one-dimensional velocity

c (in average) for particles during a binary encounter is in the x-direction for simplicity. The

stationary equations, if we neglect the time-dependent eﬀects, are

(ρc)x = 0,

2
(ρc

+ p)x = 0.

(7)

c has been spatially and locally homogenized [14] with c ∈ C 1. Thus, similar to the derivation

of u (cf. the equation (5)) we can get the average estimate of c as

c = (

1/2
)

.

Note that this velocity could be linked to the sound speed by the extended thermodynamics theory

[15-16] and might be related to the neglected (energy) contributions during Bremsstrahlung (or

collisions of particles) since it is rather weak (however, it should not be neglected considering

the strong and weak interactions of particles) compared to the photon emission or others!

3 Results & Discussions

From Fig. 1 we know that, if we transform the coordinate system into the one based on the

mass-center of these two colliding particles or molecules, as the particles are assumed to be

hard-sphere ones and have equal mass, so, the mass-center (located at the contact point or the

cross of x & y-axis) will move with the speed (cav) of total momentum divided by the total

mass [17]. The collisions are assumed to be elastic. In fact, cav is equivalent to the speed of

one-dimensional shock front. The energy associated to this velocity is rather weak (in inter-

mediate regime) and thus was neglected in conventional Bremsstrahlung (emission of photons

or other radiations) but, as mentioned above, it should be considered in the weak and strong

interactions. The remaining question is how to detect this kind of energy in the test section for

particles subjected to collisions.

Fig. 1 A head-on collision; after homogenization.

As in the kinetic theory of gas, the thermal creep and plane Poiseuille ﬂows near the boundary

are either driven by temperature gradient or pressure gradient along the wall. With eqn. (5)

and the phenomena of Mach reﬂection or Mach stem near the wall, we may say that this kind

of stationary shock can be induced by both compression and rarefaction eﬀects. That’s because

the pressure gradient and density gradient have the same sign in both cases. Then, there are

4

no diﬀerences. Besides, the microreversibility makes sense in this situation. Before we end this

discussion, we would like to mention some of the stationary shocks which appear very frequently

along the gas-surface interactions in the microscopic ways [8]: velocity-slip (or pressure-jump)

and temperature-jump. Some of the reasoning for this kind of phenomena comes from the

incomplete momentum/energy transfer during the gas-solid collision processes. How this can be

linked to macroscopic stationary shock will be our future investigations.

This work was the extension part of the author’s PhD thesis (dated 1997-Dec.) [16].

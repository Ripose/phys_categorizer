Abstract. Various Hamiltonian models have been derived for chemical
structures belonging to living organisms while the Hamiltonian concept was
not applied to life as a whole. However, Hamiltonian components were re-
cently deﬁned for living organisms on the condition to take in consideration
their evolutionary implications (Bounias, 2001: CASYS’0l). This paper iden-
tiﬁes diﬀerential elements of Spacetime, from which it delimits a probabilistic
fuzzy-like invariance standing for conservativity of biological Hamiltonians.
The distributions of potential and kinetic components in a individual bio-
Hamiltonian, and the distribution of such individual Hamiltonians of living
organisms interacting in more complex systems are shown to behave as a
non-linear generalized convolution of functions.

Introduction

While living organisms do not behave independently from the proper-
ties of matter (Bounias, 1990), for long, no Hamiltonian, nor wave function
nor Schr¨odinger equation was considered for living systems (Rosen, 1989).
The concept of a Hamiltonian of a system was originally deﬁned for phys-
ical systems in classical and quantum mechanics, them for simple chemical
systems.
In the recent past years, Hamiltonian treatment has been tried
for components of living organisms. Structures were addressed in proteins,
for solitons in Raman scattering (Xiao-Feng, 1998) and beta sheet to alpha

1

helix conformations (Ito, 1999), in DNA helix-coil transition (Morozov et
al., 2000), in plant light-harvesting chromoprotein complexes (Tretiak et al.,
2000). Functions were considered in electron transfer tunneling (Balabin et
al., 1998), and energy storage for cellular motion (Nakagawa et al., 2000).
All such works have been dealing with Hamiltonian treatment of structures
involved in living organisms, that is concerning chemical molecules rather
than the living phenomenon in its whole.

However, while Hamiltonian and wave equations are used in Physics to
try to predict the evolution of a system, up to the evolution of universe,
if similar parameters were to be identiﬁed for living organisms, they would
contribute to predict the behavior of ecosystems in connection with the sta-
tus of their embeding medium, namely Planet Earth. The main components
of the Hamiltonian of life have recently been shown to include: (i) kinetic
components as the manifold WK={WKm, WKM, WKE} of microstructural
and metabolic interactions, macroscopic activity and anticipatory behavior
leading to homeostatic and evolutionary adaptation; (ii) potential compo-
nents WP={WPm, WPM, WPE}∪ (WPg), the latter including the selection
of expressed characters from DNA existing structures, and the construction
of new genomic components by evolutionary processes (Bounias, 2001).

Since living organisms are interacting in more complex systems and ecosys-
tems, where they are embedded it was necessary to examine by which kind of
relations their respective Hamiltonians, which may be only partly conserva-
tive, could themselves be connected within more conservative supersystems.
This study will address ﬁrst the distribution of kinetic and potential compo-
nents of an individual Hamiltonian throughout the time-related sequence of
conﬁgurations, and then the distribution of interacting Hamiltonians inside
a more complex system.

1 On diﬀerential elements of spacetime

Former works have demonstrated that our observable spacetime can be
formally identiﬁed with a ordered sequence {S i} of 3-D Poincar´e sections
embedded in a 4-D topological space (Bonaly and Bounias, 1995). Mappings
of one into the next section wear the form of a momentum and stand for
inﬁnitesimal increments of time and space (Bounias, 1997). The embedding
topological 4-space is provided with a natural metrics as the set distance,

2

i.e. the symmetric diﬀerences between sets (Bounias and Bonaly, 1996; Bou-
nias, 1997), which is compatible with the deﬁnition of a topology on a space.
Each section is mapped to the next one by a moment of junction (MJ) which
connects either the distances or the objects, i.e. their complementaries or
”instans” (Bounias, 1997). In short, space is subdivided into sets intersec-
tions, standing for objects (or ”instans”) denoted by m <A, B, ...> and their
complementaries, i.e. the set distances denoted by ∆(A, B, ...).

Deﬁnition 1. The Moments of Junction are deﬁned as follows for G =

(m or ∆) and X={A,B,...}:

MJG(i,j) = Gi[X]⊥ f(i,j)(X)
where function f takes values 06 f(i,j)(X)6l (Bounias, 1997), depending on
the indicatrix functions l(x) of each point x of a section (S i) mapped into the
topologies of the next (S i+1), or generally to any further one (S j). For any
closed and open subparts Pi(X) in (S i), one has for any x:

(1)

1i (x) =

1 iﬀ x ∈ (Pi) ,
0 iﬀ x /∈ (Pi) ,

then:

spacetime.

f(i,j) (x) =

1 iﬀ 1i(x) = 1j(x),
0 iﬀ 1i(x) 6= 1j(x).

(2)

Theorem 1. The Moment of Junction provides a diﬀerential element of

Proof. Let a space increments from (S i) to (S i+1) be as small as a dif-
ference in one point. Thus, for the mapping of (S i) into (Si+1) the Moment
of Junction MJ( i,i+1) diﬀers by a distance deﬁned by d(x′
i is
the projection of xi on (Si+1). Two such points can be adjacent though
nonequal, that is the distance d(x′
i, xi+1) can be as small as needed, while
MJ( i,i+1) remains the same mathematical object. Therefore, MJ( i,i+1) stands
for a diﬀerential element of space.

i, xi+1) where x′

Then, as far as there exists at least one point xi such that d(x′

i, xi+1),
then (S) ∩ (S) 6= ∅ and the Moment of Junction is positive. Hence, MJ( i,i+1)
represents in this case the smallest interval separating two states of the con-
sidered space. This interval exists, it is non-null, though it has no measurable
duration. This denotes a diﬀerential element of time.

3

Gathered together, these two statements deﬁne a diﬀerential of both space

and time, that is of spacetime, which completes the proof.

Lemma 2.1.1. The moment of junction of the Hamiltonian of a conservative
system is distributive for its components.

Proof. Let W denote the kinetic component and V the potential one in
H=(W+V). A variation (W−dW) is accompanied by a correlated (V+dV). In
the spacetime sequence, f(.i)(Xi − dXi) 7→ f(.j)(Xj − dXi) = f(.j)(Xj) + f(.j)(dXi)
for objects composing the set X in which W and V can ultimately be mea-
sured. Then:

MJ(W ∪ V) = MJ[(W\dW) ∪ (V ∪ dV)]

= MJ(W) ∪ MJ(V) ∪ (dV\dW)]

with (dV\dW) = ⊘ iﬀ dV = dW.

(Note that the denotation A\B above signiﬁes the complementary of B in
A.)

Thus:

MJ(W ∪ V) = MJ(W) ∪ MJ(V)

iﬀ the system is conservative.

boundary of invariance.

Lemma 2.1.2. The Hamiltonian of a individual organism is aﬀected a

Proof. Let H(W,V) be the Hamiltonian of an organism A∈(X) and ϕ a
function such that: MJ(W ∪ V) = ϕ(MJ{A}). Then, H(W ∪ V) = ϕ(H{A}).
Assuming that the system A is measured by continuous variables, the mo-
ment MJ of ϕ(W,V) can be written using the joined probability density of
W and V, i.e. f(W,V) (Ruegg, 1988):

MJ[ϕ(W, V)] =

ϕ(W, V)f(W, V)dWdV

Assume the particular case where ϕ(W,V) = W∪V. Then:

The repartition function of H = W ∪ V is F(h), for H = {h1, ... , hn} is:

where h appears as a boundary delimiting the range of invariance of H.

Remarks.
(i) The distribution function f(i,j)(A) is valued in [0,1] and such is val-
ued the distribution of components giving the measure of W and V. There-
fore, the invariance boundary introduces the notion of a fuzzy invariance for
the Hamiltonian of a biological organism whose components are provided a
apparent stability by ﬂows of matter and energy from exchanges with the
surrounding milieu.

(ii) Function f(i,j)(A) deﬁnes the balance of system (A) between W and

V forms:

At extrema of global values, f(i,j)(A) = 1 denotes a absolutely motionless

state (W=0) while f(i,j)(A) = 0 depicts a state of absolute motion (V=0).

2.2 Distributions of Hamiltonian functions for two in-

teracting organisms

Deﬁnitions 2.2.1. Denote by X={A,B,Q} the set of species, habitat and re-
sources, respectively. The global ecosystem is a space of magmas [4] E={(X),
(Φ)}, where (φ) is a functional. Call (O) and (⊥) two kinds of mappings con-
necting Hamiltonians H(xi) and H(xj) for any two members of (X) and (T⊥)
the family of mappings from (⊥) to some (O). Call (ϕ) the speciﬁc kind of re-
lationship which maps two components H(xi) and H(xj) contained in H{(xi),
(xj)}. Let H[(xi) ∪ (xj)]7→ ϕ[H(xi), H(xj)] be a function (approximated as
H(xi) ∪ H(xj) in section 3.1). Note that dH(xi) 6= 0, dH(xi) 6= 0 during
interaction, with dH(xi, xj ≈ 0 for ϕ(xi, xj) ⊆ {xi, xj} ⊆ (X) ⊆ (E) ⊆ (etc.).
Repartition functions still are denoted by F and distribution functions by

f .

Theorem 2.2.2. Hamiltonians of individual components of a invariant
pair in a system with higher order of complexity are mapped by non-linear
convolution-like functions.

Proof. For continued variables, let H(z) = ϕH(xi), H(xj)). Then:

F(H(z) =

f (H(xi), H(xj)) dH(xi) · dH(xj)

(6)

Z
ϕ(H(xi),H(xj))⊆H{xi,xj})

where H{xi, xj} stands for the former fuzzy invariant boundary h of relation
(4).

For discrete variables one would have the following distribution of prob-

abilities:

ϕ(H(xi), H(xj))

=

k∈(X)
∪
k∈(⊘)

ϕ(H(xi) = k

(cid:0)

= ∁xϕ(H(xj))}
where ∁A(B) denotes the complementary of B in A, also denoted by A\B.

ϕ(H(xj)

(cid:1)

(7)

Reducing relations (6) and (7) to the particular case where one would

have: ϕ(H(xi), H(z))=(H(xi) + (xj)) would give for a discrete variable:

P(H(xi) + H(xj)) =

{P(Hxi = k) ∩ (Hxj = Hz − k)}

(8)

and for a continuous variable the repartition function:

F(Hzi) =

f (Hxi) · F(Hz − Hxi)dHxi

(9)

that is also the distribution, with commutativity between Hxi and Hxj:

f (Hzi) =

f (Hxi) · f (Hz − Hxi)dHxi

(10)

which denotes the convolution f (Hxi) ∗ f (Hxj).

This allows an extension of the general case of the functional (Φ).

2.3 Boundaries of the system

Now, some preliminary consideration should be added about the area of

validity of the above functionals.

Deﬁnitions 2.3.1. We will call ”canonic functions” the conditions for
the functionality of ecosystems which apply to all members as equivalence
relations or in a commutative way (which includes the Abelian groups for all
binary relations operating with relevant kinds of mappings). Examples are
the founding conditions (Bonaly and Bounias, 2000) of continuity, comple-
mentarity and mutualism.

We will call ”speciﬁc functions” those which connect interspeciﬁc relations
as order relations. An example is the relation ”feeding on” in predator-to-
prey relations.

Proposition 2.3.2. The domain of the convolution of Hamiltonians
[equation (13)] belongs to the set of canonical functions, and its range belongs
to the complete system of canonical plus speciﬁc functions.

How speciﬁc functions are involved will be matter of further develop-

ments.

All these results provide a perspective for further exploration of relation-
ships connecting Hamiltonian components of the Hamiltonian of a global
system.

3 Discussion and Conclusion

3.1 Outside components in potential and kinetic ener-

gies

The bio-Hamiltonian has been shown to be under inﬂuence of external
factors, though it represents an internal sum of energy. A potential energy
WP or is the product of a scalar µ (characteristic of components of mass
of an object) by a distance of functions d[ζ(xi), ζ(xj)] of its positions, where
ζ maps a causality factor applying on µ.
It is noteworthy that EPot of a
system involves the work that forces (i.e. causality components) acting on a
system are able to perform, taking into account the parameters of position,
shape, conﬁguration, of this system. Thus, components outside the system
are involved.

The kinetic energy wk or Ekin is a function of some expression of the
mass M of a system (M=∪mi) and of the square of the velocities (vi)2 of its
components, in a Newtonian, a relativistic and related forms. Importantly,
the theorem of the kinetic energy states that the variation of kinetic energy of
a system during a time lapse is the sum of all works of all forces (i.e. causality
parameters) acting on the system during this interval, thus including internal,
external and connection or interaction forces. Since vi = dxi/dt, the position
of objects is again involved.

3.2 Wave function for macroscopic objects

In classical quantum mechanics, the wave function ψ is determined by
the frequency ν and by the de Broglie wavelength (λde Broglie) of a particle
(Krasnoholovets, 2001b). So far, no physical interpretation was possible
for ψ as the root of a probability of localization. However, recently the
wave function of a macroscopic object has alternatively been shown to be
conceivable in terms of speciﬁc deformations of space, by Krasnoholovets
(2001a,b). The period and amplitude of a system composed of a peculiar form
of deformation of space (standing for a particle whose mass is proportional
to the deformations) periodically communicated partly to the surrounding
space (giving a ”inerton cloud”) and then back to the particle. During this
cycle, the velocity of a moving particle oscillates between an initial value and
zero, and its mass components oscillate between the particle and its inertons
cloud (Krasnoholovets, 1997).

8

This approach provides a physical meaning to the de Broglie and Comp-
ton wavelengths as well as to the frequency of the system, and the correspond-
ing formalism has been shown to reach a classical form. Let {π} be a set of
vector parameters describing all of the mass components of the corpuscular
system and ˆc π a limit in the velocity of transmission of space deformations;
then, ¨π − ˆc 2
π∇π = 0 (Krasnoholovets, 2002). Wave function components of
one particle can thus be extended to those of an entire organism and to all
massive objects. Furthermore, the theory consistently allows gravity and rel-
ativity to be deduced from submicroscopic properties (Krasnoholovets, 1997,
2000, 2001a). Therefore, a deterministic macroscopic wave function ψ(X,t)
becomes conceptually accessible and it can be associated with the Hamilto-
nian of living organisms. In a preliminary work (Bounias, 2001) it has been
pointed out that the trace of the macroscopic wave function of a ecosystem
in the sequence {S i} of Poincar`e sections stands for the historical of the
ecosystem, a non-linear causality factor identiﬁed by Landis (1996).

3.3 Speciﬁc conservativity status
of the bio-Hamiltonian

Studying the Hamiltonian of a living organism rather than just biochem-
ical components raises a property of fuzzy-like conservativity which contrasts
with the status of physical objects. However, no physical structure is strictly
conservative: the ceaseless motion does not exist, and all corpuscles have
limited duration of life. In a molecule, atoms have diﬀerent Hamiltonians,
and the Hamiltonian of the molecule itself is subjected to the nature of in-
teractions with its environment.

In a more complex system like a ecosystem, all components of individ-
ual Hamiltonians are interacting in a dynamical steady state. It has been
demonstrated (Bounias and Bonaly, 2000) that the state of such an ecosys-
tem is determined by the properties of the orbit of each component (which
includes species, habitat and resources) by the manifold of functions. All
combinations of these parameters are timely non-linear and the evolution of
the system is logically determined by a non-linear convolution: this supports
the result obtained here from a more fundamental approach involving the
moments of junction as diﬀerential elements of spacetime.

The fuzzy-invariance component appearing in biological systems repre-
In eﬀect, the convolution of bio-

sents a term with topological meaning.

Hamiltonians correlates all their components in a compact space since it is
ﬁnite and discrete. The Heine-Borel-Lebesgue theorem states that a ﬁnite
subcover can exist from any ﬁnite subcover: the latter is necessarily ﬁnite and
it involves all possible correlations, of which some actually are reﬂected in a
ﬁnite section of spacetime. This lets a choice about which components are
selected in a redundant system as Life, and therefore the presence of a fuzzy
operator is justiﬁed. On the other hand, while the invariance of moments
originates in empirical observations, and remains to be formally proved from a
completely independent theory, conservativity has been shown to be fulﬁlled
through a continuum of the geometry of physical objects in a 4-manifold,
where only their traces in 3-D sections have a physical meaning.

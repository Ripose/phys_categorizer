The relationship between geometry and physics is probably stronger in General Relativity (GR)
than in any other physics ﬁeld. It is the author’s belief that a perfect theory will eventually be for-
mulated, where geometry and physics become indistinguishable, so that the complete understanding
of space properties, together with proper assignments between geometric and physical entities, will
provide all necessary predictions.

+ + + +), together with its associated geometric algebra

We don’t have such perfect theory yet, however the author intends to show that GR and Quantum
Mechanics (QM) can be seen as originating from properties of the null subspace of 5-dimensional
G4,1. The space
space with signature (
so deﬁned is really 4-dimensional because the null condition effectively reduces the dimensionality
by one. Besides generating GR and QM, the same space generates also 4-dimensional Euclidean
space where dynamics can be formulated and is quite often equivalent to the relativistic counterpart.
Euclidean relativistic dynamics resembles Fermat’s principle extended to 4 dimensions and is thus
designated as 4-Dimensional Optics (4DO).

−

In this presentation the author starts with the geometric algebra

G4,1 with imposition of the null
displacement length condition and derives the method to transpose between the metrics of GR and
4DO; this transition is proven viable for stationary metrics. It is hopeless to apply Einstein type
equations in 4DO, for the simple reason that a null Ricci tensor always leads to a metric diverging to
inﬁnity. The author uses geometric arguments to establish alternative equations which are solved for
the case of a stationary mass and produce a solution equivalent to Schwarzschild’s metric in terms
of PPN parameters.

As a further development, the author analyses the case of a monogenic function in

G4,1. The
monogenic condition produces an equation that can be conveniently converted into Dirac’s, with the
added advantage that it has built in standard model gauge group symmetry.

1 Introduction

According to general consensus any physics theory is
based on a set of principles from which predictions
are derived using established mathematical derivations;
the validity of such theory depends on agreement be-
tween predictions and observed physical reality. In that
sense this paper does not formulate physical theories
because it does not presume any physical principles;
for instance it does not assume speed of light constancy
or equivalence between frame acceleration and gravity.

This is a paper about geometry; all along the paper, in
several occasions, a parallel is made with the physical
world by assigning a physical meaning to geometric en-
tities and this allows predictions to be made. However
the validity of derivations and overall consistency of
the exposition is independent of prediction correctness.

The only postulates in this paper are of a geomet-
rical nature and can be summarised in the deﬁnition
of the space we are going to work with; this is the 4-
dimensional null subspace of the 5-dimensional space
+ + + +). The choice of this geo-
with signature (

metric space does not imply any assumption for physi-
cal space up to the point where geometric entities like
coordinates and geodesics start being assigned to phys-
ical quantities like distances and trajectories. Some of
those assignments will be made very soon in the ex-
position and will be kept consistently until the end in
order to allow the reader some assessment of the pro-
posed geometric model as a tool for the prediction of
physical phenomena. Mapping between geometry and
physics is facilitated if one chooses to work always
with non-dimensional quantities; this is done with a
suitable choice for standards of the fundamental units.
From this point onwards all problems of dimensional
homogeneity are avoided through the use of normalis-
ing factors listed below for all units, deﬁned with re-
course to the fundamental constants: ~

stant divided by 2π, G

This normalisation deﬁnes a system of non-
dimensional units (Planck units) with important con-
sequences, namely: 1) All the fundamental constants,
~, G, c, e, become unity; 2) a particle’s Compton fre-
quency, deﬁned by ν = mc2/~, becomes equal to the
particle’s mass; 3) the frequent term GM /(c2r) is sim-
pliﬁed to M/r.

4-dimensional space can have amazing structure,
providing countless parallels to the physical world; this
paper is just a limited introductory look at such struc-
ture and parallels. The exposition makes full use of an
extraordinary and little known mathematical tool called
geometric algebra (GA), a.k.a. Clifford algebra, which
received an important thrust with the works of David
Hestenes [1]. A good introduction to GA can be found
in Gull et al. [2] and the following paragraphs use basi-
cally the notation and conventions therein. A complete
course on physical applications of GA can be down-
loaded from the internet [3]; the same authors pub-
lished a more comprehensive version in book form [4].
An accessible presentation of mechanics in GA formal-
ism is provided by Hestenes [5].

2 Introduction to geometric

algebra

We will use Greek characters for the indices that span
1 to 4 and Latin characters for those that exclude the 4

value; in rare cases we will have to use indices span-
ning 0 to 3 and these will be denoted with Greek char-
acters with an over bar. Einstein’s summation conven-
tion will be adopted as well as the compact notation for
partial derivatives ∂µ = ∂/∂xµ. The geometric alge-
bra of the hyperbolic 5-dimensional space we want to
G4,1 is generated by the frame of orthonormal

Note that the symbol i is used here to represent a vector

imaginary, which we don’t usually need. Note also that
the pseudoscalar I commutes with all the other basis
elements while being a square root of
1 and plays the
role of the scalar imaginary in complex algebra.

The geometric product of any two vectors a = a0i +
aµσµ and b = b0i + bνσν can be decomposed into a
symmetric part, a scalar called the inner product, and
an anti-symmetric part, a bivector called the exterior
product.

When a vector is operated with a multivector the in-
ner product reduces the grade of each element by one
unit and the outer product increases the grade by one.
There are two exceptions; when operated with a scalar
1 but grade
the inner product does not produce grade
1 instead, and the outer product with a pseudoscalar is
disallowed.

3 Displacement and velocity

Any displacement in this 5-dimensional hyperbolic
space can be deﬁned by the displacement vector

dx = idx0 + σµdxµ;

and the null space condition implies that dx has zero
length

dx2 = dx

dx = 0;

·
which is easily seen equivalent to either of the relations

(dx0)2 =

(dxµ)2;

X

(dx4)2 = (dx0)2

(dxj )2.

− X

These equations deﬁne the metrics of two alterna-
tive 4-dimensional spaces, one Euclidean the other
one Minkowskian, both derived from the null 5-
dimensional subspace.

A path on null space does not have any afﬁne param-
eter but we can use Eqs. (10) to express 4 coordinates
in terms of the ﬁfth one. We will assign the letter t and
physical time to coordinate x0 while the letter τ and
physical proper time are assigned to coordinate x4; to-
tal derivatives with respect to t will be denoted by an
over dot while total derivatives with respect to τ will be
denoted by a ”check”, as in ˇf . Dividing both members
of Eq. (8) by dt we get

The velocity vector can be obtained by a suitable rota-
tion of any of the σµ frame vectors, in particular it can
always be expressed as a rotation of the σ4 vector; we
will make use of this possibility later on.

At this point we are going to make a small detour for
the ﬁrst parallel with physics. In the previous equation
we replace x0 by the Greek letter τ and rewrite with ˙τ 2
in the ﬁrst member

˙τ 2 = 1

( ˙xj )2.

(13)

− X
The relation above is well known in special relativity,
see for instance Martin [6]; see also Almeida [7] and
Montanus [8] for parallels between special relativity
and its Euclidean space counterpart.1 We note that the
operation performed between Eqs. (12) and (13) is a
perfectly legitimate algebraic operation since all the el-
ements involved are scalars. Obviously we could also
divide both members of Eq. (8) by dτ

ˇx = iˇx0 + σj ˇxj + σ4.

(14)

P

Squaring the second member and noting that it must
be null we obtain (ˇx0)2
(ˇxj)2 = 1. This means
−
that we can relate the vector iˇx0 + σj ˇxj to relativistic
4-velocity, although the norm of this vector is symmet-
ric to what is usual in SR. The relativistic 4-velocity is
more conveniently assigned to the 5D bivector σ4iˇx0 +
σ4j ˇxj , which has the necessary properties. The method
we have used to make the transition between 4D Eu-
clidean space and Minkowski spacetime involved the
transformation of a 5D vector into scalar plus bivector
through product with σ4; this method will later be ex-
tended to curved spaces.

We will now deﬁne a new vector ds related to dis-

placement by the scale factor n

˙x = i + σµ ˙xµ = i + v.

(11)

ds = idt + nσµdxµ.

(15)

This is the deﬁnition for the velocity vector v; it is im-
portant to stress again that the velocity vector deﬁned
here is a geometrical entity and its possible relation to
physical velocity is a direct result of the coordinate as-
signments made above; if later we were to ﬁnd that the
velocity vector bears no relation to physical velocity
only the assignments would have to be reviewed but
the mathematical deductions would retain their validity.
The velocity has unit norm because ˙x2 = 0; evaluation
of v

v yields the relation

same lines.

In this way we are including the 4-dimensional ana-
logue of a refractive index; the previous equation is
a generalisation of the 3-dimensional deﬁnition of re-
fractive index for an optical medium, which relates the
optical path of light in that medium to the geomet-
ric path. The factor n used here scales the 4D dis-
placement vector σµdxµ and so it deserves the des-
ignation of 4-dimensional refractive index; from now
on we will drop the ”4-dimensional” qualiﬁcation be-
cause the confusion with the 3-dimensional case can al-
ways be resolved easily. The material presented in this

paper is, in many respects, a logical generalisation of
optics to 4-dimensional space; so, even if the paper is
only about geometry, we will frequently use the desig-
nation 4-dimensional optics (4DO) when dealing with
Euclidean 4-space.

Further generalisation of Eq. (11) makes use of a ten-
sor, similar to the non-isotropic refractive index of op-
tical media

ds = idt + nµ

ν σµdxν .

(16)

The velocity is accordingly deﬁned by v = nµ
ν ˙xν σµ.
The same expression can be used with any orthonormal
frame, including for instance spherical coordinates, but
for the moment we will restrict our attention to those
cases where the frame does not rotate in a displace-
ment in order to avoid having to derive frame vectors
when taking derivatives. This restriction poses no lim-
itation on the problems to be addressed but it is obvi-
ously inconvenient when symmetries are involved and
shall later be relaxed.

The velocity can be given the more familiar form

v = gν ˙xν if we deﬁne the refractive index frame

gν = nµ

ν σµ.

(17)

Obviously Eq. (16) implies that the velocity is still a
unitary vector and we can express this fact with through
the internal product with itself

v

v = nα

µ ˙xµnβ

ν ˙xν δαβ = 1.

(18)

·

Using Eq. (16) to evaluate ds2 = 0, considering the
deﬁnition (17) and denoting gµν = gµ ·
(dt)2 = gµνdxµdxν .

(19)

gν

This equation deﬁnes the metric of 4D space with sig-
nature (+ + ++), where t is the geodesic arc length;
this will be designated as 4DO metric because it applies
to 4-dimensional optics space.

In a similar way to what allowed us to derive 4DO
and Minkowski spaces from the null subspace condi-
tion, we will now show that general relativity (GR)
metric can also be derived from the same condition
when the refractive index is considered. In order to do
such that
this we deﬁne the reciprocal frame

i, gµ

{−

}

gµ

gν = δµ

ν.

·

where the big wedge symbol is used to make the ex-
terior product of the gµ. The reciprocal frame vectors
can then be found using the formula [4]

gν = (

1)ν

−

^ν6=µ

gµV −1.

(22)

Use the reciprocal frame to multiply both members
of Eq. (16) ﬁrst on the right then on the left by g4, si-
multaneously replacing x4 by τ

dsg4 = ig4dt + gjg4dxj + g4g4dτ ;
g4ds = g4idt + g4gjdxµ + g4g4dτ.

(23)

(24)

Performing the inner product between the two equa-
tions and setting ds2 to zero we get

(dτ )2 =

(dt)2

dxjdxk;

(25)

1
g44

gjk

−

which is recognizably a GR metric. Equation (16)
can then generate both 4DO and GR metrics, provided
some conditions are met; naturally the gµ must be in-
dependent of t if Eq. (19) is to be taken as 4DO metric
deﬁnition and conversely they must not depend on τ if
Eq. (25) deﬁnes a GR metric. However we can say that
for static metrics at least we can convert between GR
and 4DO.

4 The sources of space

curvature

Equations (19) and (25) deﬁne two alternative 4-
dimensional spaces 4DO and GR respectively; in the
former t is an afﬁne parameter while in the latter it is
τ that takes such role. Provided the metric is static the
geodesics of one space can be mapped one to one with
those of the other and we can choose to work on the
space that best suits us.

The procedure to write the geodesic equations is the
same in any curved space; if we choose to work in 4DO
this involves consideration of the Lagrangian

L =

gµν ˙xµ ˙xν
2

=

.

Following the procedure outlined in [4] to determine
the reciprocal frame vectors we deﬁne the 4-volume
tetravector

The justiﬁcation for this choice of Lagrangian can be
found in several reference books but see for instance
Martin [6]. From the Lagrangian one deﬁnes immedi-
ately the conjugate momenta

Notice the use of the lower index (vµ) to represent mo-
menta while velocity components have an upper index
(vµ). The conjugate momenta are the components of
the conjugate momentum vector v = gµvµ and from
Eq. (20)

v = gµvµ = gµgµν ˙xν = gν ˙xν .

(28)

The conjugate momentum and velocity are the same
but their components are referred to the reciprocal and
refractive index frames, respectively.

The geodesic equations can now be written in the

form of Euler-Lagrange equations

Velocity is a vector with very special signiﬁcance in
4DO space because it is the unitary vector tangent to
a geodesic; we therefore attribute high signiﬁcance to
velocity derivatives, since they express the characteris-
tics of the particular space we are considering. When
the Laplacian is applied to the velocity vector this cor-
responds to the product of a scalar and a vector and the
result is necessarily a vector

(cid:3)2v = T.

(33)

Vector T is called the sources vector and can be ex-
panded into sixteen terms as

˙vµ = ∂µL;

(29)

T = ((cid:3)2nµ

ν )σµ ˙xν = T µ

νσµ ˙xν .

(34)

these equations deﬁne those paths that minimise t when
displacements are made with velocity given by Eq.
(16). Considering the parallel already made with gen-
eral relativity we can safely say that geodesics of 4DO
spaces have a one to one correspondence to those of
GR in the majority of situations.

We are going to need geometric calculus which was
introduced by Hestenes and Sobczyk [1] as said ear-
lier; another good reference is provided by Doran and
Lasenby [4]. The existence of such references allows
us to introduce the vector derivative without further ex-
planation; the reader should search the cited books for
full justiﬁcation of the deﬁnition we give below. We de-
ﬁne two vector derivatives: the ﬁrst one is represented
by the symbol (cid:3) and is referred to the reciprocal frame
gµ while the second one uses the symbol
and is re-
ferred to the Euclidean frame σµ = σµ

∇

(cid:3) = gµ∂µ;
= σµ∂µ;

∇

(30)
(31)

the two vector derivatives are obviously related since
gµ can be expressed in terms of σµ.

a + (cid:3)

The vector derivatives are vectors and as such they
can be operated with any multivector using the estab-
lished rules; in particular the geometric product of (cid:3)
with a multivector can be decomposed into inner and
outer products. When applied to vector a the result is
((cid:3) a = (cid:3)
a); the inner product term is the
divergence of vector a and the outer product term is the
exterior derivative, related to the curl but contrary to
the latter it is usable in spaces of arbitrary dimension
and is expressed as a bivector. We also deﬁne curved
and Euclidean Laplacian as a result of multiplying each
vector derivative with itself; the result is necessarily a
scalar

The tensor T µ
ν contains the coefﬁcients of the sources
vector and we call it the sources tensor; it is very sim-
ilar to the stress tensor of GR, although its relation to
geometry is different. The sources tensor inﬂuences the
shape of geodesics as we shall see in one particularly
important situation.

v + (cid:3)

∧
G + (cid:3)

Before we begin searching solutions for Eq. (33) we
note that it can be decomposed into a set of equations
similar to Maxwell’s. Consider ﬁrst the velocity deriva-
tive (cid:3) v = (cid:3)
v; the result is a multivector
·
with scalar and bivector part G = (cid:3) v. Now derive
again: (cid:3) G = (cid:3)
G; we know that the exte-
∧
rior derivative of G vanishes and the divergence equals
the sources vector. Maxwell’s equations can be writ-
ten in a similar form, as was shown in Almeida [9];
here the velocity was replaced by the vector potential
and multivector G was replaced by the Faraday bivec-
tor F ; Doran and Lasenby [4] offer similar formulation
for spacetime.

·

Let us now concentrate on isotropic space, charac-
terised by orthogonal refractive index vectors gµ whose
norm can change with coordinates but is the same for
all vectors. Normally we relax this condition by ac-
cepting that the three gj must have equal norm but g4
can be different. The reason for this relaxed isotropy
is found in the parallel usually made with physics by
assigning dimensions 1 to 3 to physical space. Isotropy
in a physical sense need only be concerned with these
dimensions and ignores what happens with dimension
4. We will therefore characterise an isotropic space by
the refractive index frame gj = nrσj, g4 = n4σ4. In-
deed we could also accept a non-orthogonal g4 within
the relaxed isotropy concept but we will not do so in
this work.

We will only investigate spherically symmetric solu-
tions independent of x4; this means that the refractive
index can be expressed as functions of r if we adopt

The search for solutions of Eq. (33) must necessarily
start with vanishing second member, a zero sources sit-

this is a wrong assumption as we will show. Zeroing
the second member implies that the Laplacian of both
nr and n4 must be zero; considering that they are func-

When applied to n4 and equated to zero we obtain solu-
tions which impose n4 = nr and so the space must be
truly isotropic and not relaxed isotropic as we had al-
lowed. The solution we have found for the refractive in-
dex components in isotropic space can correctly model
Newton dynamics, which led the author to adhere to it
for some time [10]. However if inserted into Eq. (25)
this solution produces a GR metric which is veriﬁably
in disagreement with observations; consequently it has
purely geometric signiﬁcance.

The inadequacy of the isotropic solution found above
for relativistic predictions deserves some thought, so

that we can search for solutions guided by the results
that are expected to have physical signiﬁcance.
In
the physical world we are never in a situation of zero
sources because the shape of space or the existence of
a refractive index must always be tested with a test par-
ticle. A test particle is an abstraction corresponding to
a point mass considered so small as to have no inﬂu-
ence on the shape of space; in reality a point particle is
a black hole in GR, although this fact is always over-
looked. A test particle must be seen as source of refrac-
tive index itself and its inﬂuence on the shape of space
should not be neglected in any circumstances. If this is
the case the solutions for vanishing sources vector may
have only geometric meaning, with no connection to
physical reality.

The question is then how should we include the test
particle in Eq. (33) in order to ﬁnd physically meaning-
ful solutions. Here we will make an ad hoc proposal,
without further justiﬁcation, because the author has not
yet completed the work that will provide such justiﬁ-
cation in geometric terms. The second member of Eq.
(33) will not be zero and we will impose a sources vec-
tor based on the Euclidean Laplacian

When nr is given the exponential form found above,
the solution is n4 = √nr. This can now be entered into
Eq. (25) and the coefﬁcients can be expanded in series
and compared to Schwarzschild’s for the determination
of parameter a. The ﬁnal solution, for a stationary mass
M is

nr = e2M/r, n4 = eM/r.

(43)

Equation (41) can be interpreted in physical terms
as containing the essence of gravitation. When solved
for spherically symmetric solutions, as we have done,
the ﬁrst member provides the deﬁnition of a stationary
gravitational mass as the factor M appearing in the ex-
ponent and the second member deﬁnes inertial mass as
2n4. Gravitational mass is deﬁned with recourse to
∇
some particle which undergoes its inﬂuence and is an-
imated with velocity v and inertial mass cannot be de-
ﬁned without some ﬁeld n4 acting upon it. Complete

relation to physical quantities is not yet done; it is be-
lieved that the 16 terms of this tensor have strong links
with homologous elements of stress tensor in GR but
this will have to be veriﬁed.

5 Wave optics in 4D

In the previous paragraphs we have seen how relativis-
tic dynamics can be derived from an extension of geo-
metric optics into 4D Euclidean space and the question
naturally arises if a similar extension of wave optics can
provide any new insight into physics; this section will
give us some idea of the possibilities opened by such
approach.

Any 4D wave must verify the general wave equation

We expect waves to somehow represent elementary
particles; for this to be possible they must be compati-
ble with the velocity deﬁnition (28) and Dirac’s equa-
tion. The latter is a ﬁrst order differential equation,
consequently we must establish a ﬁrst order wave equa-
tion from which one can derive the second order one,
velocity and Dirac equation. One possible ﬁrst order
equation is

((cid:3)

−

i∂t)ψ = 0.

(45)

This produces Eq. (44) if we multiply on the left by
((cid:3)
i∂t). Equation (45) is also the condition for ψ to
be a monogenic function [4].

−

The wave equation allows for harmonic solutions

and consequently we try the following solution

ψ = ψ0eu(±p0t+pµxµ);

(46)

here u is a square root of
1 whose characteristics we
−
shall determine, p0 is the wave angular frequency and
pµ are components of a generalised wave vector. When
this solution is inserted in the 1st order equation (45)
we get

(gµpµ ∓

ip0)ψ0u = 0.

(47)

The ﬁrst member can only be zero if ψ0 is a multiple of
the vector in parenthesis and is nilpotent, i.e.
gµνpµpν −

(p0)2 = 0.

(48)

We note here that Rowlands has been proposing a
nilpotent formulation of Dirac equation for some years,
albeit with a different algebra [11].

The velocity deﬁnition is incorporated in Eq. (47)
sufﬁcing for it to assign the conjugate momentum com-
ponents to the wave vector by the relation

vµ =

pµ
p0

.

In order to recover Dirac’s equation from Eq. (45)
we have to consider the ﬁeld free situation, which
amounts to replacing the curved vector derivative (cid:3) by
its Euclidean counterpart
; the equation then becomes
i∂t)ψ = 0. Multiplying on the left by σ4 we get
(
∇ −

∇

σ4i∂t + σ4j∂j + ∂4)ψ = 0.

(50)

(
−

Now note that σ4i squares to unity and σ4j squares to
minus unity, so it is legitimate to make assignments to
the Dirac matrices: γ0
σ4j . The last
≡ −
term in the previous equation must be examined with
consideration for the proposed solution; deriving ψ
with respect to x4 we get ∂4ψ = p4ψ0u exp[u(
p0t +
pµxµ)]. Since u will always commute with the expo-
nential, this simpliﬁes to

σ4i, γj

≡

±

(51)

(52)

We can then make the further assignments p0 = E,
p4 = m and write

γ ¯µ∂¯µψ =

mψu.

−

Dirac’s equation has been written in a similar form
by Hestenes [12, 13], Doran et al. [14] and Doran and
Lasenby [4]; in all cases the authors chose u = σ12
but we feel this to be a rather restricting option.
In
fact there is no reason why one should not be able
to use any of the 12; 23; 13 choices for the bivec-
tor index or even bivector combinations; for instance
u = (σ12 + σ23 + σ13)/√3 seems a perfectly reason-
able choice, with the advantage that it is symmetric in
the 3 spatial coordinates. Pending further studies we
propose the following associations for the elementary
particles:

down quarks: u = σ32 and permutations;

up quarks: u = (σ23 + σ31)/√2 and permuta-
tions;

electron: u = (σ21 + σ32 + σ13)/√3.

•

•

•

Electric charge is obviously encoded by 1/3 the num-
ber of basis bivectors intervening in u with charge sign
being given by the direct or reverse order of the vectors.
Consistently with the former assignments we propose
that anti-particles use the basis bivectors symmetric to
those listed above. For instance u = σ32 is a down
1/3 and u = σ23 is its anti-particle
quark with charge
sign
with charge +1/3. Spin is associated with the
in the exponent of ψ, one of the signs for up spin and
the other for down spin.

6 Conclusion

Our point of departure is the assumption that physics
will one day become indistinguishable from geome-
try, once uniﬁcation and true understanding of physics
has been achieved. The exposition was essentially ge-
ometric, demonstrating that the 4-dimensional space
that can be obtained from 5-dimensions with signature
++++) by imposition of null displacement length,
(
−
incorporates relations that are the same as found in the
main physical theories.

It was shown that general relativity metrics can be
derived in such space, as well as the metrics of 4D Eu-
clidean space; a conversion formula between the two
spaces’ metrics was derived for stationary metric cases.
The equations relating space curvature to its sources
were investigated for Euclidean space and solved for
the case of spherically symmetric mass. The solution

that was found is PPN equivalent to Schwarzschild’s,
although it will produce very different predictions for
large M/r.

The study of geodesics in 4D Euclidean space is
equivalent to the extension of geometric optics to 4 di-
mensions, justifying the designation 4-dimensional op-
tics. This extension would not be complete is it did
not apply to wave optics. It is shown that a 4D wave
equation can be obtained from the monogenic condi-
tion applied in 5D. The latter is also shown to produce
Dirac equation and to be compatible with the dynamics
equations established before.

A somewhat speculative encoding for the seven el-
ementary particles of the ﬁrst generation is also pro-
posed, based on the multiple square roots of
1 present
in the algebra. This is a subject to be developed in
forthcoming publications.

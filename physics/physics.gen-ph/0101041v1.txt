Abstract

It is pointed out that the hierarchy of fractal dimensions characterizing transﬁnite heterotic string spacetimes

bears a striking resemblance to the sequence of the number of lines lying on Del Pezzo surfaces.

Employing the notion and properties of the so-called Cantorian fractal space, E (∞), El Naschie has
recently demonstrated [1–5] that the transﬁnite heterotic spacetimes are endowed with the following ﬁve
characteristic dimensions

Dκ =

(α−1

=

¯α0

φ2+κ,

where κ = 0, 1, . . . , 4, ¯α0 is the mean value of the ﬁne structure constant and φ stands for the Hausdorﬀ
dimension of the zero Cantor set. Taking ¯α0 = 137 and φ = 0.618034, he found the following remarkable
series [1]

D0 ≃ 26 → D1 ≃ 16 → D2 ≃ 10 → D3 ≃ 6 → D4 ≃ 4.

The aim of this short contribution is to show that this sequence can almost exactly be reproduced by the
arrangement of the multiplicities of the conﬁgurations of lines lying on Del Pezzo surfaces.

A Del Pezzo surface [6], FN , is a normal surface of order N sitting in an N -dimensional projective
space, where N =3,4,. . . ,9. Taken together, these surfaces form a single simple series F9 → F8 → . . . → F3,
such that FN (3 ≤ N ≤ 8) is always the projection of FN +1 from a point of itself. In addition, all of them
are represented on a projective plane by means of systems of non-singular cubic curves having 9 − N
points in common – the latter being usually referred to as the base points. A line of FN is mapped on
the plane into a base point, a line joining two base points, or a conic passing through ﬁve of the base
points (see, e.g. [7]); hence, the number of lines lying on FN , Θ(N ), is simply

Θ(N ) = (9 − N ) +

with the understanding that

(cid:18)

Θ(3) = 27 → Θ(4) = 16 → Θ(5) = 10 → Θ(6) = 6 → Θ(7) = 3,

which, indeed, parallels so closely the sequence given by Eq. (2). It is worth noticing that

Θ(3) − Θ(4) = 27 − 16 = 11 = 10 + 1 = Θ(5) + 1

and

Θ(5) − Θ(6) = 10 − 6 = 4 = 3 + 1 = Θ(7) + 1.

In order to better understand the origin of this hierarchy, as well as to see how intricate the connection
between the individual Del Pezzo surfaces is, we project FN , N ≥ 4, into a three-dimensional projective
F3, and the
space, denoting these projected surfaces as
twenty-seven lines on it [8]. If we disregard any one line and the ten lines which are incident with it,

FN . We ﬁrst take our familar cubic surface F3 ≡

And thus, since the cubic surface F3 is a boundary member of the Del Pezzo series, all the above-

of the following intriguing extension and generalization: the hierarchy of characteristic dimensions exhib-
ited by the transﬁnite heterotic string spacetimes has its algebraic counterpart in the relationship between
the conﬁgurations of lines lying on Del Pezzo surfaces of order three to seven.

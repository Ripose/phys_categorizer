Abstract: Using the accepted methods to extract natural system behavior from the
Einstein-Hilbert gravitational ﬁeld tensor equation, a new coordinate transforma-
tion is analyzed. It is demonstrated that these extraction methods yield speciﬁc
contradictions. Two such contradictions are that for an electrically neutral (non-
rotating) Schwarzschild conﬁguration there is an inﬁnite redshift surface that is not
an event horizon and for a speciﬁc Schwarzschild conﬁrguration, no dustlike particle
external to this conﬁguration will, with respect to proper time, ever gravitationally
collapse radially to the surface of the conﬁguration.

Einstein’s Equivalence Principle

Within our universe, is it possible to diﬀerentiate physically between the force
eﬀects of a gravitational ﬁeld and the apparent force needed to produce a bodies
accelerated motion, where the only observations that can be made are behavior of
test bodies aﬀected by these forces? Notice that this question is relative to properties
associated with “forces” and not the equivalence of initial and gravitational mass.
With the help of his famous “elevator analogy,” Einstein wrote:

[Let K ′ be a system of reference such that] relative to K ′ a mass suf-
ﬁciently distant from other masses has an accelerated motion such
that its acceleration and direction of acceleration are independent
of its material composition and physical state.

Does this permit an observer at rest relative to K ′ to draw the
conclusion that he is on a “really” accelerated system of reference?
The answer is negative; for the above mentioned behavior of freely
moving masses relative to K ′ may be interpreted equally well in the
following way. The system of reference K ′ is unaccelerated, but the
space region being considered is under the sway of a gravitational

ﬁeld, which generates the accelerated motion of the bodies relative
to K ′. (Ohanian and Ruﬃni, 1994, p. 53)

However, Fock wrote:

As was mentioned, Einstein considered that from the point of view
of the Principle of Equivalence it is impossible to speak of absolute
acceleration just as it is impossible to speak of absolute velocity.
We consider this conclusion of Einstein’s to be erroneous .
.
(1959, p. 208)

.

Fock gives an example for his claim that uses a rotating noninﬁnitesimal (i.e. non-
local) physical structure and that contradicts the above Einstein statement.
It
seems that under most conditions experienced within our universe such eﬀects, for
macroscopic entities, can be diﬀerentiate one from another. This lead Fock and
most theorists to modify, at the least, Einstein’s original hypothesis so as not to
forget “that the nature of equivalence of ﬁelds of acceleration and of gravitation is
strictly local.” (Fock, 1995, p. 369)

This is not the last word on this principle, however. The mathematical model
chosen to model the Einstein theory of gravity uses the inﬁnitesimal calculus. The
methods of corresponding physical behavior to the mathematical structure were
speciﬁcally ignored. One needs to approximate physical inﬁnitesimal measures be-
fore such a structure can be considered as a meaningful mathematical model. Grav-
itational tidal eﬀects are the eﬀects that a gravitational ﬁeld has upon macroscopic
physical objects. Because of the existence a special instrument called a gravity
gradiometer, an instrument that can measure the local diﬀerences in the tidal ef-
fects or what is termed the tidal ﬁelds, the principle requires a further adjustment.
The gravity gradiometer can be reduced to a comparatively small size and, since
it can be so reduced, it represents an approximate physical “inﬁnitesimalizing pro-
cess.” Apparently, as this instrument is reduced in size it is less likely to measure
a diﬀerences between tidal forces and the forces associated with pure acceleration.
This has lead Ohanian and Ruﬃni to make a further adjustment to this principle;
an adjustment in which I concur.

The following is still a general statement relative to all possible gravitational
ﬁelds within our universe. For this theory, the term point particles intuitively refers
to physical entities that are very small, but not small enough to be controlled by
pure quantum mechanical properties. Further, such entities are, usually, restricted
to behavior within very small “distances” and are assumed not to have a signif-
icant gravitational ﬁeld themselves so that they do not measurably inﬂuence the
“stronger” gravitational ﬁeld being investigated. It is the diﬀerential equation model

2

that, by a special type of summation of these eﬀects, allows one to describe behavior
of point particles over macroscopic “distances.”

Gravitation and acceleration are only equivalent as far as the trans-
lational motion of point particles is concerned (this amounts to
what we call the Galileo principle of equivalence, sometimes also
called the “weak” principle of equivalence.) (Ohanian and Ruﬃni,
1994, p. 53)

The discussion in this section indicates how, by means of further reﬂection or
experimentation, an original hypothesis is altered without substantially eﬀecting
a physical theory’s conclusions. However, with respect to the Einstein’s General
Theory, the following sections of this article demonstrate that some of the most
basic hypotheses used to deduce physical conclusions may need to be altered in
order to avoid absolute contradictions.

Further Basic Hypotheses

Einstein rejected the concept of the privileged observer. Intuitively, this means
an actual entity that can take measurements and represent these measurements in a
speciﬁc manner. Further, a privileged observer would describe a privileged form of
physical law by representing physical law only in this speciﬁc manner. Speciﬁcally,
Einstein rejected:
.
absolute space. . . (Lawden, 1982, p. 127)

. the Newtonian concept of a privileged observer, at rest in

.

This concept also is intended to imply that there is no privileged position within
our universe from which to observe.
In order to model mathematically the “no
privileged observer” concept, we need to model for this Einstein theory the concept
of “observer.”

(1) An observer is modeled by a speciﬁc coordinate system, where
a coordinate system is a deﬁnable process that will measure each
member of an “ordered 4-tuple” (x1, x2, x3, x4).

Thus whenever you read the term “observer” it signiﬁes mathematically “a
speciﬁc coordinate system.” But not all deﬁnable process are allowed in the deﬁni-
tion of what constitutes a coordinate system. And, on the other hand, the concept
of “deﬁnable” depends intuitively upon the language and logic one applies. So we
cannot actually known what is or is not “deﬁnable.” But, physically, it is usually
required that for any two intuitively diﬀerent physical events, at least one of the
members of the two representing 4-tuples is diﬀerent. The diﬀerence in 4-tuple co-
ordinates depends upon the objects used. Usually, the coordinates themselves are
real or complex numbers and we conﬁne these remarks to this case.

3

In the physical sciences, coordinate measures for physical events are used in an
attempt to glean from the relations between these measures what has been termed
as natural law. Under the assumption of no privileged observer, if two diﬀerent
modes of coordinate measure as modeled by the concept of “coordinate systems”
are used to express relations between the 4-tuples that represent diﬀerent events,
then one should be able to glean from these relations the same physical law. As
mentioned, in order to model this idea, the concept of the no physically preferred
coordinate system is introduced. Ohanian (1976, p. 253) states this as follows:

It must be possible to express physical laws in any coordinate sys-
tem. This is obvious since ultimately these laws express nothing
but relationships between spacetime coincidences. The result of
any experiment can always be reduced to a statement of the form
‘. . . when the ends of the two wires coming out of instrument A
are made to coincide with the two terminals of instrument B, then
the pointer on the face of instrument A will coincide with the third
mark on the scale, etc.,’ that makes no reference to coordinates.

4, and further suppose that we have four other variables xi, 1

There are actually inﬁnitely many mathematical theories where equations can
be considered invariant in form under coordinate transformations. For example,
consider the expression Auv, where u and v vary independently from 1, . . . , 4. Sup-
pose that these 16 “components” are expressed in terms of real valued variables xi,
4 and
1
that these new variables are related to the original ones by four real valued equations
xi = fi(x1, x2, x3, x4), 1
4. Consider a ﬁxed relation R = R(xi, xi) deﬁned in
terms of the 8 variables. Require that the only acceptable objects that can be used
must have the following transformation law. That when we substitute for all the
xi variables that appear in R and Auv, the transformed result A
satisﬁes the rule
= RAuv. It follows easily that if we have three such collections of components
A
Auv, Buv, Cuv, then equations such as Auv = Buv + Cuv and CuvBuv = BuvCuv

Since the concepts of the calculus and diﬀerential equations are used in the
Einstein theory, the transformation law R that is used for the components is based
upon how one usually writes the diﬀerential of each of the new variables. Due to
this and other concerns, the mathematical model used does not satisfy the idea of
any coordinate system, but restricts such systems to the set of all proper coordinate
systems.

In the Einstein theory, the proper coordinate systems are related to two diﬀer-

4

ent modes of coordinate measurement used to characterize the same physical event
by what appear to be two diﬀerent 4-tuples. The two diﬀerent systems used should
be related so that the two diﬀerent 4-tuples can be associated uniquely one with an-
other and this association would indicate that the physical event is the same event
but is simply being observed in diﬀerent ways. In order to model mathematically
this concept, the idea of the proper coordinate transformation is used.

(2) For the 4-tuple’s, proper coordinate systems are related by four
equations, called coordinate transformations so that, at least within
a local real spacetime region, the coordinates of one of the 4-tuples
can be used to calculate uniquely the coordinates of the other 4-
tuple, and conversely.

But can one actually write down all of the coordinate transformations that
satisfy (2)? The answer is no since there are inﬁnitely many of them.
In the
Einstein theory, the actual coordinate systems used to glean physical behavior are
obtained by “trial and error” (Misner, Thorne and Wheeler, 1973, p. 832). Further,
in order to have a structure that might be used to “express physical laws in any
coordinate system,” although the actual set is a restriction to proper systems as
mentioned, Einstein selected the absolute diﬀerential calculus or tensor analysis
(Ricci-Curbastro and Levi-Civita, 1901) as the appropriate mathematical structure.
The use of the absolute diﬀerential calculus, however, further restricts the proper
coordinate systems to those that can be transformed by means of regular coordinate
transformations.

(3) We add to (2) the requirement that the four transforma-
tion equations must satisfy a special set of partial diﬀerential
expressions, at the least, in a region called a neighborhood “about”
a speciﬁc 4-tuple.

In order to minimize the technical aspects of this article, the relations required
by (3) will not be speciﬁcally stated. Fock (1956) argued that there would need to
be an additional constraint placed upon the coordinates used. His work incorpo-
rates what are called the harmonic coordinate conditions and he shows that under
this constraint there is, apart from a Lorentz transformation, a privileged (unique)
coordinate system called the harmonic system. However, Misner et. al. (1973)
reject this contention.

. . . to make a choice among coordinate systems is exactly what
the geometrodynamic law cannot and must not have the power to
do. (p. 409)

Indeed, Ohanian and Ruﬃni (1994) also make the same observation. Note that,

In ordinary non-coordinate geometry, there are certain intuitive concepts that
appear to be related. No coordinate system, as such, should alter these geometric
relations. One application of the absolute diﬀerential calculus allows some concepts
from diﬀerential geometry to be stated in a form that is independent from coordi-
nate systems of type (3). For example, under the restrictions stated above, if all
components of the Riemann-curvature tensor are zero (i.e. Rα
βµν = 0) through-
out all of geometric space, then the space is Euclidean (i.e. ﬂat) and distances
can be measured by a simple Pythagorean relation. This ﬂatness is thought to be
independent of the coordinate system used and, hence, we have this tensor expres-
sion. This mathematical structure was devised so that the form of this equation
does not change when coordinate transformation of the type (3), with the special
transformation law R, are applied. Apparently, this is the basic reason Einstein
selected this structure as the one that would model physical law and preserve the
no privileged observer hypothesis. Further, he could use, as a model, the previous
language of Riemannian geometry with its reliance upon diﬀerential equation so-
lutions to geometric problems. However, confusion lies in the fact that Einstein’s
theory is but a physical model that predicts the behavior of physical entities but
does not speciﬁcally deﬁne any physical entity that comprises space[time]. Patton
and Wheeler (1975) state:

Five bits of evidence argue that geometry is as far from giving an
understanding of space as elasticity is from giving a understanding
of a solid. . . . Tied to the paradox of the Big Bang and collapse
is the question, what is the substance out of which the universe is
made? (p. 539, 543)

The Major Hypothesis

For purposes of simplicity, in all that follows, “light units” will be used for our
measurements. That is: we set the famous constant c = 1. [Note: due to the use of
light units, if a unit analysis is applied to the following expressions in this paper,
then the unit statements will appear to be inconsistent.] Einstein’s General theory
is a generalization of his Special theory. For his Special theory, it was observed by
Minkowski that the famous Lorentz transformation equations expressed in terms of

6

t, x, y, z and t′, x′, y′, z′ coordinates, which are regular, satisfy the diﬀerential
expression

(Although it will not be discussion further, I mention that this equation can also be
arrived at by considering the behavior of electromagnetic radiation. Indeed, there
is a derivation from ﬁrst-principles that shows explicitly that the variables in (1)
are actually physical measures made by “inﬁnitesimal” light-clocks and should not
be considered as any other possible mode of measurement if consistency is to be
maintained (Herrmann,1994b).)

The expression (1) is denoted by ds2 and is called the spacetime interval or the
more descriptive inﬁnitesimal Chronotopic interval. Further, (1) is called a “metric”
but, so as not to confuse this term with that used in other mathematical theories, it
will be termed, in all the follows, as the Minkowski line element. Now the equality in
(1) holds for those many transformations that comprise the “Lorentz ( or Poincar´e)
group.”

In four-dimensional diﬀerential geometry, we have a similar expression for any

four variables x1, x2, x3, x4.

We then have a general reason why the tensor structure is used for the classical

theory.

The gravitational theory of Einstein is based upon the following
postulate: Principle of general invariance: All laws of physics must
be invariant under general coordinate transformations. (Ohanian
and Ruﬃni, 1994, p. 374)

The Coordinate Method

The Einstein-Hilbert gravitational ﬁeld equation, without the cosmological

constant, is expressed in tensor form as

Rµν −

gµν R =

8πGTµν ,

(4)

where the tensor Rµν and scalar R on the left side are expressed completely in terms
of the gµν and their derivatives, and the components on the right expressed by the
tensor Tµν are components of the physical “energy-momentum” tensor. The G is
the universal constant of gravitation. It is now obvious why a geometric language is
used as a model since all the corresponding terminology from diﬀerential geometry
that involves the gµν may be utilized.

Our major concern is a solution to (4) in the exterior regions of a universe
that contains but one centrally symmetric homogeneous nonrotating distribution
of matter. We begin this investigation with the following general result, where we
have substituted ρ for the variable r.

If we use “spherical” space coordinates ρ, θ, φ, then the must
general centrally symmetric expression for ds2 is

2
ds2 = h(ρ, t)dr2 + k(ρ, t)(sin

l are certain functions of the “radius vector” ρ
where a, h, k,
and “time” t. But because of the arbitrariness in the choice of
a reference system in the general theory of relativity, we can still
subject the coordinates to any transformation that does not destroy
the central symmetry of ds2; this means that we can transform the
coordinates ρ and t according to the formulas

where f1, f2 are any functions of new coordinates r′, t′.” (Landau
and Lifshitz, 1962, p. 324)

I point out that such transformations are often confused since, after the substi-
tutions are made, the “prime” notation is often dropped from the new expression.
The standard procedure now continues in the following manner. One usually choices
k′(ρ, t)ρ2, where
ﬁrst, a(ρ, t) = 0, Then k(ρ, t) can be chosen so that it appears as
k′(ρ, t) is to be determined. When k′(ρ, t) = 1, the usual θ, φ portion of the stan-
dard spherical coordinate transformation is obtained. The gravitational ﬁeld is one
produced by a centrally symmetric homogeneous nonrotating distribution of matter.
Since physically this line element is a generalization of equation (1), a choice
for k′(ρ, t) is made so that the line element will become asymptotically ﬂat. This
means that as ρ
this new element will correspond to the Minkowski line
element as it is expressed in spherical coordinates. Application of this boundary
condition implies that k′(ρ, t)

functions h and l. Hence, letting x1 = t, x2 = ρ, x3 = θ, x4 = φ, we have that

For the physical electrically neutral case considered here (the Schwarzschild
conﬁguration), where we include the static condition that the ﬁeld is time in-
dependent and time symmetric (i.e. unchanged by time reversal), Schwarzschild
(1916) found the following values for the functions and, hence, for the correspond-
ing gµν that satisfy the Einstein-Hilbert equation for the gravitational ﬁeld ex-
ternal to the mass and that satisfy the “Minkowski condition at inﬁnity.” Let

.”(Misner, et. al, 1973, p. 820) near these points. However, the
standard claim is that these values for the gµν satisfy the Einstein-Hilbert equation
for ρ > rs and for positive ρ < rs. (Lawden, 1982, p. 155) Further, if the actual
Schwarzschild conﬁguration has ρ > rs, then the line element only applies for a
vacuum condition exterior to the conﬁguration and any anaylsis for ρ < rs as no
physical meaning. (Lawden, 1982, p. 146) Also, Lemaˆitre (1933) claims that the
“Schwarzschild singularity” at ρ = rs is not a physical singularity since, following
the above major hypothesis on coordinate transformations, it can be removed by a
coordinate transformation. Thus it is claimed that it is but a coordinate singularity.

.

.

Ohanian and Ruﬃni are emphatic when they write, “It is important to recog-
nize that the Schwarzschild ‘singularity’ at ρ = rs is not a physical singularity. The
‘singularity’ in Eqs. (2) and (3) is spurious, or a pseudosingularity; it arises from
an inappropriate choice of coordinates and can be eliminated by a change of coordi-
nates.” (Ohanian and Ruﬃni, 1994 p. 440) Lemaˆitre’s transformation and all other
coordinate transformations that have appeared since 1933 in accepted treatises on
this subject claim that for this explicit physical scenario ρ = 0 is a physical singu-
larity and is not simply a coordinate singularity. A physical singularity is deﬁned
descriptively in various ways such as spacetime behaves in an unusual manner or
the theory brakes down completely or the known laws of nature are suspended and
other such statements. It also has a lengthy technical deﬁnition. Although ρ = rs
represents what is claimed to be but a coordinate singularity, this does not pre-
clude further analysis since spacetime may still have some interesting and unusual
properties alone the Schwarzschild surface ρ = rs. The ﬁrst basic analysis assumes
that the Schwarzschild conﬁguration is interior to ρ = rs where, except on this
surface, the metric coeﬃcients satisfy the Einstein-Hilbert equation exterior to the

10

conﬁguration. What method has been used to glean physical statements from line
elements that only involve statements associated with coordinates and statements
that appear to be relative only to the local (inﬁnitesimal) environment?

The Classical Global Method

Ohanian and Ruﬃni (1994) state speciﬁcally the physical interpretation for the

geometric concept called the geodesic.

Furthermore, the motion of a particle in the ﬁeld of the gravi-

Further, Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1973, p. 334) state that

“Curva-
Speciﬁcally, the
ture is the simplest local measure of geometric properties.”
Riemann-curvature tensor yields the behavior of the tidal forces. The classical
global method is to investigate the behavior of the Riemann-curvature tensor as a
test particle in free-fall approaches various positions within the Schwarzschild ﬁeld.
Such a free-fall may be characterized at a point by a special set of coordinates called
the geodesic coordinates. Using this technique, it is found after some tedious calcu-
lations (Misner et. al. 1973, p. 820-823; Ohanian and Ruﬃni, 1994, p. 440-441),
using the Schwarzschild coordinates, that each of the components of the Riemann
tensor at points on the Schwarzschild surface ρ = rs is ﬁnite. This is stated physi-
cally by Ohanian and Ruﬃni (1994, p. 440) as meaning that “An astronaut falling
through and crossing the surface ρ = rs will not feel anything unusual” and this is
considered as a “local event.” On the other hand, the same type of analysis shows
at least one of the Riemann-curvature components is unbounded at ρ = 0 and this
local event is described as meaning that as an astronaut approaches this position
the tidal force will destroy the individual.

For reference purposes, a singularity that results in unbounded tidal forces is
called a D-type singularity. There are signiﬁcant reasons way a D-type physical sin-
gularity needs a type of external shield. Without such a shield a D-type singularity,
if it actually forms due to gravitational collapse, is called a “naked singularity.”

.

. the formation of a naked singularity during collapse would
.
be a disaster for general relativity theory.
In this situation, one
cannot say anything precise about the future evolution of any
region of space containing the singularity since new information
could emerge from it in a completely arbitrary way. (Shapiro and
Teukolsky, 1991, p. 994)

The usual name given for the shield that would surround a D-type singularity

11

is called the event horizon.

Although the region ρ < rs [ρ = r] has no unusual properties of a
local kind (except at ρ = 0, where there is a singularity), it does
have some unusual properties of a global kind. As we will see from
a careful analysis of the spacetime geometry, the region ρ < rs
is a black hole. By this is meant that no signal of any kind can
emerge from the region ρ < rs and reach the region ρ > rs. The
surface ρ = rs (regarded as a surface in spacetime .
. ) is the
boundary between spacetime points that will become observable at
some time, and those that will never be observable by outsiders.
This boundary of the black hole is called the event horizon.
.
. The surface ρ = rs acts as a “one-way membrane,” through
which signals can be sent in, but not out. This is a global (or
nonlocal) property because in order to test it, we must examine
the propagation of light signals and other signals and check what
happens to them in the long run. (Ohanian and Ruﬃni, 1994, p.
443-444)

.

.

The event horizon is often confused with a surface of inﬁnite redshift and they
need not be the same (Ohanian and Ruﬃni, 1994, p. 438, 466-468). But, they
coincide for the Schwarzschild ﬁeld as expressed by the following line element (5)

One way to determine, with respect to coordinate measures (ρ, t), the existence of
inﬁnite redshift surfaces is to consider g11 = 0. As Ohanian and Ruﬃni (1994, p.
464) state “The vanishing of g11 merely tells us that a particle cannot be at rest
(with dρ = dθ = dφ = 0) at these surfaces; only a light signal emitted in the radial
direction can be at rest.” This surface can also be determine by the discussion of
“clocks.” In all that follows, rs has been substituted for 2GM .

The surface ρ = rs is a surface of inﬁnite redshift. A clock placed at
rs/ρ dt which
rest near to ρ = rs shows a proper time dτ =
approaches zero as ρ
rs; that is the clock runs inﬁnitely slow
compared with a clock at a larger distance. (Ohanian and Ruﬃni,
1994, p. 439)

The simplest way to analyze this event horizon is to consider but radial

for light signals moving towards the Schwarzschild surface from a far distance and
towards the center, and dρ/dt > 0 for light signals moving from the center outward
towards the surface. Note that Ohanian and Ruﬃni, (1994, p. 466) state that to
ﬁnd possible event horizons one puts dρ/dt = 0. Equation (5) yields two results, in
terms of the (ρ, t) coordinate measures, dρ/dt =
rs/ρ). A very useful pro-
cedure is the “light-cone” analysis (Ohanian and Ruﬃni, 1994, p. 446). External

interior signature of spacetime changes to (
and the character of the light-cone diagrams change. The light-cones are orientated
in a complementary direction throughout the interior region, and this orientation
is interpreted to mean that, at the least, electromagnetic signals cannot leave the
region interior to the Schwarzschild surface. The same type of conclusion is reached
if one investigates the behavior of “material” particles. Also note that if the interior
Schwarzschild ﬁeld were extended to inﬁnity, then the corresponding Minkowski line
element would have g11 =
1 and g22 = +1. It would seem as if “time” and “dis-
tance” reverse their character with respect to radial movement. Indeed, coordinate
arguments relative to “light” signals that lead to the conclusion that a surface is an
event horizon use this alteration in the character of spacetime and corresponding
light-cone analysis.

In order to investigate the possibility within General Relativity (GR) that
photons and particles can actually pass through the Schwarzschild surface in one
direction, what are called “well-behaved” coordinate systems are introduced, coor-
dinate systems that lead to line elements that can be deﬁned at ρ = rs and retain
the D-type singularities for the transformed ρ = 0. One of the less unusual transfor-
mations is the Eddington-Finkelstein transformation (EFT) (Misner et. al. 1973,
p. 828-830). However, the EFT is not deﬁned at ρ = rs and, indeed, diverges
there. Another is the Kruskal-Szekeres transformation (KST) (Misner, et. al. 1973,
p. 831-835; Ohanian and Ruﬃni 1994, p. 449-459). Once again the KST is not
deﬁned at ρ = rs since it is not regular at that point.

deﬁned in terms of the original ρ, t and rs, and a second coordinate u in teams

coordinates are dimensionless. Further, the same coordinate free description can be
given relative to the “relationship” between the behavior of photons “within” the
transformed Schwarzschild surface and the D-type singularities. But, since the line
element may now be deﬁned at what is the transformed Schwarzschild surface, this
additional aspect, that could not be analyzed in Schwarzschild coordinates, may
be investigated. The investigation leads to the additional statement that “photons
can actually pass through the Schwarzschild surface in one direction and towards
the center of the mass.” The KST coordinates also add other major features that
appear to be missing when viewed in the Schwarzschild system. This is explained
as follows:

How can this be? . . . The answer must be that the Schwarzschild
coordinates cover only a part of the spacetime manifold; they must
be only a local coordinate patch on the full manifold. Somehow, by
means of the coordinate transformation that leads to the Kruskal-
Szekers coordinates, one has analytically extended the limited
Schwarzschild solution for the metric to cover all (or more nearly
all) of the manifold (Misner et. al. 1973, p. 833)

The above contention is illustrated by means of the well-known KST coordinate
diagram where various t and r coordinates are graphed within the KST system
(Misner et. al. 1973, p. 834; Ohanian and Ruﬃni, 1994, p. 452). The diagram is
partitioned into sections I, II, III, IV. This KST spacetime is said to be maximal
and this is interpreted to mean that physical particles can appear and disappear
only at physical singularities. The Schwarzschild solution only occupies or covers
the regions I, II. The physical descriptions for the KST coordinates is what has
inspired many science ﬁction stories. The full KST space is the object that has
introduced the “white hole” and “Einstein-Rosen bridge (i.e. wormhole)” into a
cosmology. However, one scientist writes:

Through Kruskal’s work is undoubtedly of high theoretic interest,
does it have practical application? At present, perhaps not.
Kruskal space would have to be created in toto:
. There
is no evidence that full Kruskal spaces exist in nature. (Rindler,
1977, p. 164)

.

As mentioned, Fock (1959, p. 194) shows that there does exist a unique coor-
dinate system if you require the harmonic restriction. Misner et. al (1973) reject
this additional condition. However, one can use a regular coordinate transformation
and obtain Fock’s line element. Simply let α = rs/2 and then ρ = r + α. When this
is substituted into the Schwarzschild equation (5), one obtains

According to the rules, these metric coeﬃcients satisfy the Einstein-Hilbert
equation for the regions 0 < r < 0.25 and 0.25 < r. Note that for the region
r > 0.25 there is no spacetime signature change. However, there is such a signature
change within the region 0 < r < (√2
1)/2. Our analysis will mainly be concerned
with the behavior in the vacuum region r > 0.25. When the absolute value and
signum operators are eliminated from the metric coeﬃcients, it appears necessary
to present the line element in two forms, one for r > 0.25 and one for 0 < r < 0.25.
The g11 has two distinct forms that are, of course, equal and continuous at r = 0.25.
The expressions for g33 and g44 are identical. The expressions for the two g22 are
diﬀerent in that one is multiplied by the extra factor f (r) = (2r

but they are both not deﬁned at r = 0.25. Indeed,

It is obvious from (7b) that the asymptotic behavior about r = 0.25 for these
two diﬀerent g22 is essentially identical and, indeed, very well behaved. This not the
case with the Schwarzschild line element (5) which is not well behavior in neigh-
borhoods about r = 0.25 where it has divergent asymptotic behavior. However,
stated rules such as

might express a transformed line element. Indeed, we are told that the behavior of

The ﬁrst obvious and remarkable aspect of these static components is that they all
converge to 0 as r
0.25 and can be so deﬁned in order to maintain continuity at
r = 0.25. The next obvious aspect is that the components for r < 0.25 all diverge as
0 + . Although one could analyze these components for r < 0.25, our interest is
r
to investigate physical behavior for r
0.25. For example, these static components
have no other zero values for any r > 0.25 and they are maximal, in the absolute
sense, at r = 0.5. [Note: An additional factor called the Lorentz boost does not
appear to alter the physical behavior associated with these static components.]

For all of the following analysis, it is assumed that we are concerned with a
r < 0.5. To ﬁnd the inﬁnite
conﬁguration with material radius r such that 0.25
redshift surfaces, consider the argument of Ohanian and Ruﬃni (1994, p. 439). We
assume that dr = dθ = dφ = 0 and since we are measuring in light unites, the
proper time expression dτ 2 = ds2. This yields that

(8)

The exact same argument given by Ohanian and Ruﬃni in terms of the “time”
dilation of t yields that r = 0.5 is an inﬁnite redshift surface. But, of course, this
is in terms of the (r, t) coordinates. Although in accordance with the rules for
interpreting coordinate transformations, the question should not be investigated,
we can ask whether r should be considered as a true “distance” measure. For
large values of ρ and r, say, 1, 000 and beyond, the ρ and r are approximately
linearly related. Such a relation appears always to be acceptable. Further, from

ρ < .2565 and converges to .25. According
r = 10 and beyond the diﬀerence r
to quotations
a physically described property such as inﬁnite
,
redshift of a light signal should not depend upon the coordinate measure ρ or r. An
observer at a large ρ and r “distance,” that when compared are “approximately” the
same and linearly related, would notice the increasing redshift for either coordinate
representation (r, t) or (ρ, t). If such a physical description does not depend upon
an individual’s deﬁned ρ coordinate, then it cannot depend upon an individual’s
corresponding r coordinate according to the rules.

One of the most basic coordinate methods used to locate an event horizon
is to analyze the “one-way membrane” concept relative to the geodesic path of
light. Consider the geodesic of a “light signal propagating in the radial direction”
(Ohanian and Ruﬃni, 1994, p.445). Hence, let ds = 0, where dθ = dφ = 0. In (r, t)

As stated in
, the existence and location of event horizons is not dependent upon
a coordinate system. Further, as argued above, whether we use r or ρ measures
should not make any diﬀerence in the gleaned physical behavior at r = 0.5. The
analysis used sets dr/dt = 0.
In this case, we have two possibilities, r = 0.5 or
r = 0.25. Unfortunately, referring back to the metric coeﬃcients, one notices that
there is no signature change within the region r > 0.25. Analysis of the light-cones
shows there is no alteration in their orientation relative to the surface r = 0.5,
and, hence, this surface is not an event horizon as described by the (r, t) system.
But, it is an inﬁnite redshift surface. This contradicts the requirement that for
the Schwarzschild conﬁguration being considered both of these surfaces should have
the physical property of coinciding.
[Indeed, note that for r = 0.5, we have that
ρ = 1; the surface for which it is claimed they coincide.] If one wishes to analysis
the surface r = 0.25, then it is also not an event horizon.

Technically, comparing this coordinate system with another system in order
to “explain” this apparent contradiction is forbidden for it would assume that
the methods used are consistent. But, an argument that might eliminate this
contradiction, using this forbidden method of comparison, is that you should not
3
use r as a “distance” coordinate although the general rules stated in
}
don’t include such an ad hoc requirement. Indeed, the KST suﬀers from a “physi-
cal” diﬃculty when its coordinates are considered as “real” measures. If the above
arguments relative to (r, t) are not suﬃcient, then one cannot argue for any physical
concept using the KST (u, v) coordinates. Please note that, in the KST (u, v), v

method in Rindler (1977, p. 152) is applied. In order to solve the free-fall geodesic
equation for a material particle, the ﬁrst constant of integration is obtained by
considering the particle at an extreme distance from the center of attraction. In
this case, the space is approximately ﬂat and, in terms of proper time, dr/dτ

Since this is a diﬀerential equation model, this model would only apply, in this
exact manner, to inﬁnitesimal particles. Hence, when one discusses the behavior
of actual natural objects, the equations only give approximate behavior and the
description used should be somewhat general in character. This discussion is only
relative to the region r > 0.25. The term “time” refers to proper time and terms
relative to the “speed” of motion refer to proper speed. From a far away location, the
material particle starts slowly on its journey towards the center of attraction. The
speed increases until the particle reaches the inﬁnite redshift surface. It passes this

19

surface at its greatest speed and this corresponds to where the gravitional eﬀects, for
this region, are maximal. Once it passes this surface, the speed decreases. Assume
that speciﬁc Schwarzschild conﬁguration with material “radius” r = 0.25. [Note:
Notwithstanding Rindler’s comments relative to such a “radial” measure, there is
in the next section a discussion indicating what would occur if such a measure
is rejected.]
In order not to introduce a physical concept of “inﬁnity” into this
description, one can proceed as follows: Starting from any speciﬁc radial position
exterior to the inﬁnite redshift surface (say a = 1, 000) this real material particle
takes a ﬁnite amount of time (
21, 089) to reach the inﬁnite redshift surface.
Consider any natural number n. The particle will require more than na proper time
units before it can ever reach the surface of the conﬁguration.

The above description contradicts quotation

and also contradicts a descrip-
tion for the behavior of the objects speed as represented by the diﬀerential equation
on page 448 of Ohanian and Ruﬃni (1994). This physical description comes from
an assurance by Rindler (1977, p. 153) that by “continuity it [the material parti-
cle’s geodesic] evidently represents one path.” Further, the description in the above
paragraph is in terms of physical concepts that are but gleaned from the coordinate
system used. Note that the stated meaning of the geodesic path of a particle implies
that if the particle like behavior of a material is used as a means to investigate the
gravitational collapse of a Schwarzschild conﬁguration within such a gravitational
ﬁeld, then after the exterior surface of the conﬁguration collapses through the inﬁ-
nite redshift surface, the collapse could essentially stop and no actual “black hole”
formed although a “black hole” would “appear” to exist under the usual obser-
vations. Such an appearance is due to the behavior of an inﬁnite redshift surface,
which is not an event horizon, and what are the maximal gravitational eﬀects within
this region.

Countering These Contradictions

There are additional procedures that one might use in an attempt to counter
these contradictions. Although it is not relevant to the contradictions presented
here, if one calculates the “proper distance” d(r) (Misner, et. al. 1973, p. 824),
taking into account the increasing or decreasing nature of “proper velocity,” then
it follows that as r
. Hence, in physical terms,
the proper distance becomes exceedingly great after the particle passes through the
inﬁnite redshift surface. This can be explained as simply the result of using proper
time and proper speed to calculate the proper distance. Of course, it could also be
0.25+
but another “physical” contradiction. Moreover, one might note that as r

rs then the
any less strange than that which occurs in the KST, where as r

. Should an attempt be made to embed, informally or
rigorously, this new coordinate system into the KST system? This would amount
to considering other types of transformations that would “paste” portions of the
manifold obtained from these new coordinates onto the KST manifold. Once again,
this is entirely unacceptable for it assumes the logical consistency of the GR methods
used to argue for the KST physical scenarios and that the KST scenarios are the
only correct ones. If one were to ignore this prohibition, then the simplest identity
transformation (i.e. the “r” in this new coordinate system corresponds to the “ρ”
used in the KST) shows that this new coordinate system does completely cover the
KST system and leads to the conclusion that the region of diﬃculty between the
r = 0.25 surface and inﬁnite red shift surface will be, in the KST system, a region
. This also would tend to lead to the rejection of the “radius” of the
where u
conﬁguration as being measured by r = 0.25 since such a measure corresponds to the
Schwarzschild radius of ρ =
. Using this “forbidden” transformation comparison
approach or an approach that claims that the “radius” measurement of r = 0.25
has no physical meaning, one might claim that this is why the particle “never”
reaches the r = 0.25 surface since the particle is actually “moving towards” totally
ﬂat space. However, this conclusion would contradict the basic interpretation that
a particle’s continuous geodesic represents a free “fall” within a gravitational ﬁeld.

→

The reason this previous approach is forbidden is a purely logical one. It is well-
known that if you do not add to or adjust the hypotheses used that the following
is a correct logical argument. Consider statements P, Q written in the appropriate
manner and using only the predicates associated with GR. Suppose that we have
logically established that the statement “P and not P” holds. Then we know that,
in general, the statement “P and not P implies Q” holds logically. Hence, the
statement “Q” holds. But “Q” can be any statement whatsoever.

The easiest method that could be used to counter these results is to simply
give an ad hoc rejection based upon the “obviously absurd” physical predictions.
Such coordinate system interpretations as here discussed would be called “patho-
logical” by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1973, p. 934). However, applying the
Ferris comment, the correct term is “contradictory” and this leads to all of the logi-
cally unacceptable diﬃculties inconsistency entails. In general, these contradictions
can be avoided in the same manner as is done within informal mathematics. As
previously outlined, informal mathematics is inconsistent if one is not careful as to
how one deﬁnes entities. Mathematicians have learned how to do this by “staying
away” as far as possible, so to speak, from such deﬁnitions. A similar Bergmann

21

(1965) ad hoc philosophy of science could be applied. “There exists a subset of
physical variables, the ‘observables,’ whose values are independent of the choice
of the coordinate system employed. Thus, any relationship between observables is
‘meaningful,’ and, conversely, these are the only relationships that are legitimate”
(p. 346). But, using the Bergmann philosophy, then the entire black hole scenario
would be rejected. The arguments given in this paper indicate that it may be the
methods used to glean physical behavior from coordinate system relationships, using
an inappropriate mathematical structure or not using a preferred coordinate system
that might be the cause for these contradictions. Indeed, the very Einstein-Hilbert
equation with its correspondence between the energy-momentum tensor and Rie-
mannian geometry could be totally in error. There are many present day theories
that might be used to replace the Einstein theory. For example, the very basic con-
cepts of black hole theory need not be abandoned if these concepts are obtained by
diﬀerent means. Such a means and a corresponding theory does exist (Herrmann,
1994b).

Conclusions

Relative to cosmology, these research ﬁndings are of signiﬁcance if the calcu-
lations are found to be valid. These ﬁndings would aﬀect the relationship between
GR cosmological models for how our universe develops, and the methods utilized
to obtain such models. Clearly, a signiﬁcant scientiﬁc concept associated with cos-
mological models is strict consistency relative to scientiﬁc logic. Such cosmological
models would be worthless if contradictions should occur. The results of this re-
search should be kept in mind when such models are constructed using scientiﬁc
logic applied to secular theories, theories which may rely upon methods or hypothe-
ses that lead to inconsistencies.

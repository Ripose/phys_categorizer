Spatially Diﬀerential Forms of Lenz Law

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Two sets of spatially diﬀerential formulas of Lenz law on electromagnetic inductance are presented.
They are a cut-magnetic ﬂux induced voltage, which instantaneously results from cutting magnetic
ﬂux as a conductor moving with respect to an external magnetic ﬁeld, and a wave-induced voltage
due to the interaction of a conductor or charged particles with the arriving electromagnetic wave,
which is originated from a changing magnetic ﬂux source. Upon the Lenz diﬀerential forms, the
induced electrical ﬁeld strength, relevant properties and their application are discussed.

Lenz law, as an empirical rule, sums production and
property of inductive electromotive force in a conductor
loop when an interaction occurs between the circle loop
and a steady magnetic ﬁeld or changeable magnetic ﬁeld.
It is expressed in an integral formula of induced electro-
motive voltage on whole conductor loop and can be ap-
plied for a totally induced electrical voltage calculation
in steady-symmetric circumstances [1],

Upon Eq.(2), for having diﬀerently physical proper-
ties the cut-magnetic ﬂux induced ﬁeld and wave-induced
ﬁeld on the conductor are classiﬁed into two categories.
The former is related to energy conversion from mechan-
ical kinetic energy to electrical energy, and the latter re-
lated to the conversion from an electromagnetic wave ki-
netic energy to an associated energy carried or possessed
by a conductor or charged particles.

The spatial diﬀerential Form of the cut-magnetic ﬁeld

induced voltage can be given below,

However in physical practice there are variety of in-
duction phenomena which occur in a non-steady status
with asymmetric circumstances; or the induced electrical
strength are needed to be calculated upon an interestedly
particular point, segment of conductor on diﬀerently spa-
tial condition as such where the integral form Eq.(1) can
not be in use [2, 3]. Moreover the integrated form
will cover some explicit details of physical prop-
erties that can be revealed and applied through its
spatially diﬀerential forms. Like the important role
of Biot-Savart theorem (or diﬀerential form of Ampere
theorem) on magnetic ﬁeld calculation[ [1, 4], therefore,
the presentation of the diﬀerential form of Lenz law will
be signiﬁcant to time-dependent calculation of induced
electrical ﬁeld.

Actually electromagnetic inductances occur on a spa-
tial conductor element or charged particles much more
often than on a whole conductor loop. Mathematically
the integral form is merely an accumulated sum of spa-
tial diﬀerential inductance results along the whole loop.
And in viewpoint of physics, the causes of all electro-
magnetic inductance phenomena could be divided into
two categories: cut-magnetic ﬂux induced electrical ﬁeld
and wave-induced electrical ﬁeld. The integral form is
given as

with respect to B(t), vdℓ·b = vdℓ − vb;

Ec(t) — induced electrical ﬁeld strength in conductor
element by cutting magnetic ﬂux; or induced electrical
force per unit length along vdℓ·b(t) × B(t) direction by
cutting B(t) ﬁeld.

As conductor element dl moves in external magnetic
ﬁeld the Lorentz action will cause an energy conversion
from a non-electrical energy (such as kinetic energy) to
an electrical energy. It is the action that results in an
induced electrical ﬁeld strength Ec(t) inside of the con-
ductor, or an elemental induced electromotive force or
voltage dεc(t) in conductor, its value depends upon in-
duced electrical ﬁeld strength, and size and orientation
of the conductor. The derivation is following:

Eq.(5,6) reveal that at spatially diﬀerent points of the
conductor, Lorentz action exerted on the positive and
negative charges within the conductor, the separately
electromotive force in the opposite directions, is the only
cause to form the cut-induced electrical ﬁeld within a
conductor.

Another type of electromagnetic inductance results
from the interaction of the conductor or charged particles
as electromagnetic load with the arriving electromagnetic
wave. The energy of the electromagnetic radiation, orig-
inated from a changing magnetic ﬂux source or a source
of magnetic ﬂux rate, will induce an associated electrical
ﬁeld at the conductor location and be transferred into an
associated energy of the conductor or charged particles

Eq.(7,8) manifest a general explicitly formula of purely
wave-induced electrical ﬁeld strength at a detector posi-
tion where the charged particles or a conductor serve as
a electromagnetic load to interact with an arriving elec-
tromagnetic wave.
In the process an energy exchange
will occur among the electromagnetic energy possessed
by the load and wave respectively. It is known that the
associated induced electrical strength is related to spatial
propagating distribution, attenuation and time delay of
the wave-energy.

For a steady wave-induction circumstance, the induced

voltage element can be expressed:

Eq.(11, 12) testiﬁes that the calculated results are con-
sistent by using any one among the diﬀerential form of
wave-induced electrical ﬁeld and Lenz integrated form
along a closed circular loop in a steady-symmetry induc-
tion situation with even-radial electromagnetic radiant
wave from center of the loop.

Combining the two types of inductance together, there
are the consequences on the total inductance forms as

following.

The spatial diﬀerential forms can be applied mainly to

two aspects.

1. Calculation of induced electrical ﬁeld strength will
be conducted on any particular point, segment
or non-closed loop of conductor with asym-
metry circumstance where Lenz integral form
can not be applied in purpose, such as the calcu-
lation of wave-induced electrical ﬁeld strength at
center point of a toroid source of changing magnetic
ﬂux; the calculation of wave-induced electrical ﬁeld
(Ew) could be applied to a time-dependent spatial
(Ew) ﬁeld distribution.

2. Explicit and quantitative analysis on the energy
conversion, spatial orientation or polarization of in-
duced electrical ﬁeld strength on a conductor ele-
ment and their time rate in a dynamic process of
electromagnetic inductance. In addition, the time
delay of the wave-induced signal, due to the wave
propagating from the source of magnetic ﬂux rate
to the conductor element, can be analyzed upon
the spatial diﬀerential form.

Lenz experimental law can be reduced to two funda-
mentally spatial diﬀerential forms: cut-magnetic ﬁeld in-
duced electrical ﬁeld and wave-induced electrical ﬁeld on
a conductor element.
In both cases a relative velocity
between the conductor and a contact magnetic ﬁeld or
magnetic ﬂux rate ﬁeld is necessary preposition for in-
ductance occurrence. The spatial diﬀerential forms
not only manifest explicitly the physical essence
of electromagnetic inductance but also can be ap-
plied as the calculating formulas in variety of cal-
culation and analysis of electromagnetic induc-
tance phenomena where Lenz integral form can not
oﬀer the relevant explicit solution as its mathematical
limit.

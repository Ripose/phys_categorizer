Abstract

It is considered neutrino ﬂux in the rotating reference frame. Due to the rotation of
the frame, neutrino is observed as a superposition of two states P-transformed one from
another. Since P-transformation is forbidden for neutrino, in the rotating reference
frame one can detect a half of neutrino ﬂux. Due to the rotation of the earth, the
detector of neutrinos can measure a half of the solar neutrino ﬂux predicted by the
SSM that may provide a solution for the solar neutrino puzzle.

Weak interactions violate P-invariance and C-invariance but conserve CP-invariance [1].
The operations of C-transformation and of P-transformation are forbidden for neutrinos, but
the operation of CP-transformation is allowed for neutrinos.

Take the rotating reference frame. Turnover of the frame at the angle π corresponds to
P-transformation of the frame. Under rotation, the positions of the frame in the range from
π to 2π are P-transformed from the positions of the frame in the range from 0 to π. Neutrino
in the rotating frame is observed in the superpositional state

(|ν > +P|ν >).

However P-transformation is forbidden for neutrino thereforer it is forbidden to detect neu-
trino in the state P|ν >. Hence when measuring neutrino ﬂux in the rotating frame it is
forbidden to detect a half of neutrino ﬂux.
As known [2], [3] experiments measured solar neutrino ﬂuxes signiﬁcantly smaller than
those predicted by the standard solar model (SSM), e.g. [4], [5]. Discrepancy between the
theoretical and experimental neutrino ﬂux from the sun presents the solar neutrino puzzle.
The Homestake experiment measured [6] an average 37Ar production rate by solar neu-

trinos in 37Cl of

Rate (Chlorine) = 2.55 ± 0.17(stat) ± 0.18(syst) SN U

(2)

The Kamiokande II and III experiment reported [7] the data consistent with 8B solar

−1.2 SN U predicted by the SSM [5].

which is 32 ± 5% of the 8.1+1.0
neutrino ﬂux of

φν⊙ = [2.9 ± 0.2(stat) ± 0.3(syst)] × 106cm−2s−1

(3)

which is 51% ± 9% of that predicted by the SSM [5].
of

The GALLEX experiment measured [8] a 71Ge production rate by solar neutrinos in 71Ga

Rate (Gallium) = 79 ± 10(stat) ± 6(syst) SN U

The SAGE experiment measured [9] an average 71Ge production rate by solar neutrinos

−6 SN U predicted by the SSM [5].

which is 60% ± 10% of the 131.5+7
in 71Ga of

Rate (Gallium) = 74+13

−12(stat)+5

−7(sys) SN U

(5)

−6 SN U predicted by the SSM [5].

which is 56% ± 11% of the 131.5+7
Due to the rotation of the earth, the detector of neutrinos can measure a half of the solar
neutrino ﬂux predicted by the SSM. This is consistent with the data of the Kamiokande,
GALLEX, SAGE experiments and signiﬁcantly reduces the discrepancy between the theoret-
ical and experimental data for the Homestake experiment. So the eﬀect under consideration
may provide a solution for the solar neutrino puzzle.

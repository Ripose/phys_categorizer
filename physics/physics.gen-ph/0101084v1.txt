Abstract

The paper discusses some aspects of real physical space and time: struc-
ture of electrodynamics; structure of gravitational-inert theory in the real
world; formation of the real matter; Mach’s principle and the radiational
cosmic mass; spread and transmission of information in the space of the real
world; fundamental and main physical constants, protostar or 3+1-dimensional
matter; and some philosophical and general physical approaches to solutions
of physical problems.

1. In the real 4-dimensional space the 3-dimensional and 1-dimensional
subspaces are distinguished with the coeﬃcient of imaginary relativity ci
between their dimensions. That is why it is thought of as 3+1-dimensional
and relativistic space.

2. Electrodynamics - To the 3-dimensional subspace, determined by 3-
dimensional polar vector ﬁeld (electrical), axial (magnetic) vector is added
in the form of a relativistic addition. The union of these vector ﬁelds creates
the polar-axial (electromagnetic) anti-symmetric tensor of the fourth order.
Lagrange’s vector equation, which is obtained on the basis of Lagrangian,
becomes Maxwell’s equations of electrodynamics.

For such a space, as a consequence, the communicational wave equation

is obtained which is determined by d’Alembert’s operator

3. Earlier we showed that an equation is added to Einstein’s equation
determined by the counter-projection of tensor [1]. Also an expression was
received which presented the geometric interpretation of the active principle
of equivalence:

1

(−) Pik = Pik

(2)

Just like the magnetic ﬁeld is added to the electric ﬁeld in electrody-
namics, here the inert ﬁeld is added to the gravitational ﬁeld in the form of
equation Gik = 2Pik . These ﬁelds are associated with each other through
the principle of active equivalence [1].

4. On the basis of the principle of active equivalence in [1] we received
an algebraically transcendental equation, the core of which is illustrated in
ﬁg 1.

Fig. 1a presents the equilibrial main state of a virtual particle with real
mass equal to zero. On ﬁg. 1b, after deformation of 3+1-dimensional space,
another equilibrial state is created, which determines the real, stable matter
with a ﬁnite mass. The surface of integration is determined from point 1, in
the direction of increase of x, as well as in the direction of decrease of 1/x.
The mass obtained this way is the source of gravitational and inert ﬁelds,
and the electric charge is a necessary attribute during formation of the usual
matter [1]. However, it must be noted that the divergence from the real value
is approximately 10%, which is due to the spin of the object.

5. In [1] we received and formulated Mach’s principle. Mi = mi + mi
is the eﬀective mass eﬀecting the test body. Relative to the test body, on
the leverage i on both sides, there will always be compensating each other
masses mi and mi . Then the eﬀective impact on that leverage is equal to
zero, and therefore Mi = mi + mi = 0. Naturally, the summation by i is also
equal to zero.

Mi = 0

The average value of mass (3) is equal to zero, and the shift from the
average value is diﬀerent from zero. Then M =
represents the
radiational cosmic mass. It creates oscillations in the Metagalactic environ-
ment (vacuum oscillations). We think that the real radiation (three-degree
equilibrial radiation) is responsible for this phenomenon.

perpetuum motion of the second type. Virtual particles, which are members
of non-excited environment, are in one main state, and the union of these

2

particles creates macroscopically non-excited vacuum. That is why entropy,
which is determined as the logarithm of statistical weight of macroscopic
states of subsystems, is equal to zero, S = 0.

On the basis of Nernst’s theorem, we conclude that the non-excited vac-
uum can be viewed as a thermodynamic system at the absolute zero. For
information transmission it is necessary to excite the environment (vacuum),
by ﬁlling it with excited particles (create ﬂuctuations).

7. The fundamental constants are G, c, h . Their combinations can
create hc, c4/G, the fundamental charge and force respectively, formed from
the combination of two constants. In [1] the non-measure constant α2 = hc
e2
(with 10% accuracy) is received, which associates the real matter with the
fundamental constant of space (environment).

Let us consider energy e2/r along the entire accessible length (from r to

R). It is assumed that the integral represents the fundamental charge, i.e.

The measures of the Metagalaxy are estimated at the same value through
astrophysical observations. If the fundamental length in the formula is sub-
stituted by the fundamental value of mass, then we receive

M = m0 exp

M ∼ 1055gr

The value of the mass of the Metagalaxy is also in accordance with as-

trophysical estimations.

is equal to zero outside of the atom.

mc2 (classical radius of

the proton).

Another fundamental constant c4/G represents Coulomb’s, as well as
Newton’s forces for fundamental physical values.
It is assumed that after
formation of the Real World, Newton’s force between the Metagalaxy and
the hydrogen atom, does not change on the distance equal to the classical
radius of the hydrogen atom.
Let us introduce R =

c2 - the value of the classical hydrogen atom
radius (analogous to that of charged particles). For Newton’s force between
the Metagalaxy and the hydrogen atom we receive:

represents the ratio of Coulomb force to Newton’s force in the hydrogen

atom.

The numerical results received here surprisingly accurately coincide with
experimental data. Thus, main dimendsionless physical constants like α2 =

r0 exp α2, M = m0 exp α2 - the size and mass of Metagalaxy, and Hubble’s

8. On the basis of generalization of the theory of non-stationar starts, and
the analysis of activity of the nuclei of galaxies, and galaxies with blue excess,
allowed V. Ambartsumian to conclude that the process of star formation
and non-stationar state of some formations are connected with protostar
substance [2], which degrades and becomes usual matter. This process is
accompanied by release of enormous amount of energy. There have not been
any direct observations of objects with protostar substance.

We think that such protostar substance may be the 3 + 1-dimensional
substance, which decomposes into smaller unstable fragments until reach-
ing the state of stable particles (electron, proton, photon), releasing energy.
Then these particles form the usual 3-dimensional substance, the most ba-
sic of which is the hydrogen atom. Stable conﬁgurations, such as white
dwarfs, neutron stars (Oppenheimer, Volkov), hyperonic stars (Ambartsum-
ian, Saakian, Vartanian) etc, can not be protostar objects. However, there is
one interesting work by Muradian [3,4], which describes the morphology of
the macroscopic hadron (two-dimensional heavy hadron), which, due to being
unusual (application of nuclear physics laws in astrophysics), may possibly
be the protostar substance.

If the proton and the electron are the stable ”relic” substance (3 + 1-
dimensional), then in order to understand the protostar macroscopic sub-
stance, it is necessary to build the internal electrodynamics of the charged
particle. The physical presentation of their microscopic forms (electron and
proton), may serve as protostar macroscopic substance (one possibility is
the ball lightning). Therefore it is necessary to build the electrodynamics
of charged particles, or receive Maxwell’s equations (non-traditional), which
describe the internal structure of electromagnetic ﬁeld.

9. a) Let us consider equality

P + P = 1

(13)

The sum of probabilities of a phenomenon and its counter-phenomenon

is equal to one.

Example: n number of shooters have a hypothetical probability of to hit
the target pi. It is necessary to ﬁnd the probability of hitting the target in the
case of simultaneous shooting. Due to factorization of the counter-probability

6

P =

(1 − pi) , we receive P = 1 −

(1 − pi)

Problem is solved.
This method allows to solve if not all, then the majority of problems in

the theory of probabilities and statistics (for big n).

b) Deﬁnition

If a function with a counter-argument becomes its own counter-function,

such a function is called a counter-odd function.

f (x) = f (x)

f (x) + f (x) = 1

One of the particular solutions of the functional equation is

f (x) = sin2 x,

x + ¯x =

x + ¯x = 1

,

The simultaneous happening of the phenomenon and the counter-phenomenon

takes place in anti-phase. If we imagine the electric and magnetic ﬁelds to be
the phenomenon and the counter-phenomenon respectively, then Maxwell’s
electrodynamics can be presented through the model of the example.

c) In [1] we received

where Pik is the tensor of counter-projection, and for scalars the tensor

equation becomes equation (14).

We received that the sum of scalar curvature G and curvature G is equal
to one. In the framework of this model we received the equation of the inert
ﬁeld.

Cases a) and c) can be brought to case b) if we assume that the object
and the counter-object change and depend on the parameter of state. More

Gik + Gik = 2Pik

G + G = 1

examples can be brought which are described by this model. Based on these
examples, the general law can be formulated.

The core of the law of dialectics on ”struggle and unity of opposites” lies
not so much in the ”struggle”, rather it lies in their unity. This means that in
the process of the ”struggle”, one opposition becomes enriched at the account
of the other one. Thus, oppositions struggle, and in this process they turn
into each other either partially or completely. These changes happen in the
anti-phase. The process of opposing may be stationar, like in examples a) and
c), or non-stationar, as in b). If we assume that objects described in examples
a) and c) are non-stationar, then they also can be brought to example b).
Electrodynamics is described by the model of example b), where the object
is the electric ﬁled, and the counter-object is the magnetic ﬁeld. Maxwell’s
equations form a uniﬁed system where the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds
oppose to each other and change in the anti-phase. As a consequence of the
uniﬁed system the wave equation is received.

If we assume that in examples a) and c) the objects are non-stationar,
then for the ﬁrst example the wave equation of amplitudes of probabilities
is expected, while for the third example the wave equation of the symmetric
tensor gik is expected.

Similarly to equations for 4-dimensional vector potential, the electromag-
netic ﬁeld can also be generalized into a 10-component tensor equation like
(16). Rules of d’Alambertian eﬀect on tensor are not yet completely clear. It
is necessary that construction (cid:3) be some kind of general diﬀerential operator
of the second order, which contains a member like

(15)

(16)

This operator requires further mathematical work.

In [1] we used ex-
treme values of the object and the counter-object and received two pairs of
equivalent equations:

Gik + 2

= 0, Gik = 0, F irst equivalent pair

(gik − δik)
ξiξi

(cid:3)A = 0

(cid:3)gik = 0

∂2gik
∂xµ∂xυ = 0

8

Gik − 2

(gik − δik)
ξiξi

= 0, Gik = 0, Second equivalent pair

which describes gravitational and inert ﬁelds.
Examples used in point 9 demonstrate that the object and the counter-
object coexist and form a uniﬁed system. The real physical space and time
are described by such general physical aspects.

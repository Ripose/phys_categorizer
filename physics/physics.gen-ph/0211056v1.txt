Uniﬁcation of classical and quantum mechanics

(Dated: November 12, 2002)

This paper is a serious attempt at reconciling quantum and classical mechanics through the
concept of dynamic space and the acceptance of non-zero Ricci tensor for vacuum. Starting with
scalar particles, the paper shows that with those two points allow predictions of General Relativity to
be made with an equation which includes Kein-Gordon as a special case; this equation is designated
the source equation. The paper then moves on to show that Dirac equation is compatible with the
source equation written in a more general form. 4-dimensional optics is introduced as an alternative
to space-time, which is shown to allow similar predictions except in extreme situations, but has the
great advantage of ascribing both gravity and electro dynamics to space curvature.

Keywords: Uniﬁed theories; quantum mechanics; general relativity

INTRODUCTION

of the equation that were found in purely mathematical
grounds.

General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are the
two most successful theories in Physics; each in its own
ﬁeld of application seems to be the ultimate theory, yet
every eﬀort to merge them together has encountered un-
surmountable diﬃculties. Particle physics is reasonably
explained by the Standard Model, in spite of this theory’s
uncomfortable number of parameters. It has frequently
been said that the uniﬁcation of General Relativity with
Quantum Mechanics and the Standard Model can only
arise from a new paradigm which drastically departs from
some of the present day assumptions setting Physics in a
new framework. Some people believe that String Theory
provides this new way of thinking and is the road to uni-
ﬁcation [1]. In spite of some success we feel that String
Theory is not yet the answer everybody is waiting for,
not the least because it is an extremely complex theory
while intuitively one prefers theories that are simple, at
least in their basic principles.
Inevitably mathematics
will always become more involved as complex problems
are attacked. This paper makes a contribution for a uni-
ﬁed theory based on simple equations but it does use
concepts that are unusual and may be diﬃcult to accept
due to long established habits. The paper introduces a
generalization of Dirac’s equation such that not only elec-
trodynamics but also gravitation can be accounted for.
Full compatibility with the Standard Model is not ex-
plored in this work but the path that must be followed
is delineated.

The author has previously made some attempts at for-
mulating a uniﬁed theory of physics, namely through the
use of the 4-Dimensional Optics (4DO) concept [2, 3]; the
present work presents a more fundamental approach, de-
parting from a mathematical equation deprived of phys-
ical interpretation. The concept of space is used as a
purely geometric concept and the notions of distance,
space or mass are introduced in connection to solutions

∗Electronic address: bda@ﬁsica.uminho.pt

In this paper we use the concept of dynamic space
which is entirely linked to some dynamics under study
and not preexisting. Dynamic space exists for the dy-
namics and the latter occupies the former completely.
Ultimately all dynamics are part of the grand Universe
dynamics and this supports a universal space; when we
choose to consider some dynamics isolated from the Uni-
verse we also deﬁne a dynamic space which contains and
is contained by the dynamics. Consider as examples a
planetary system or a galaxy; in either case the study
of their dynamics in isolation involves the deﬁnition of a
particular dynamic space which does not extend outside
the edges of each particular system. The observation of
some dynamics by a non-interfering observer is impossi-
ble; the observer has to participate in the dynamics in
such a way that dynamic space is extended to include
him. We will ﬁnd ways to deal with non-interfering ob-
servers by a suitable change of coordinates between dy-
namic space and observer space; this is seen as a useful
approximation, frequently more manageable than the ex-
act solution which would involve including the observer
as one element of the dynamics.

Our strategy for this work involves showing that Klein-
Gordon equation and gravitation can be made compati-
ble through the dynamic space concept associated with
a rejection of empty space and consequent zeroing of the
Ricci tensor for vacuum. We will then show that the
same assumptions can be applied to Dirac equation and
propose its generalization such that electrodynamics and
gravitation become eﬀectively integrated. 4-dimensional
optics with its associated space appear as a consequence
of this process, which could not be achieved with conven-
tional space-time. We will also suggest that the source
equation may have some solutions which explain the exis-
tence of elementary particles as dynamic systems in their
own right.

II. CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND
KLEIN-GORDON EQUATION

The list of non-zero Christoﬀel symbols is

In this section we examine how Kein-Gordon equation
and gravity can be merged into a single equation, des-
ignated the source equation; later on we will show this
to be a consequence of a more fundamental equation in-
cluding Dirac’s as a special case. The source equation is
a 4-dimensional diﬀerential equation with respect to the
four variables xµ, which should be seen as pure numbers
without any physical meaning; the concepts of distance or
time are absent at this stage and are later deﬁned within
the theory. The simplest form of the source equation is

gµν

ψ,

(1)

∇µν ψ =
where gµν is a metric tensor and ψ is a function of the
4 variables with some general characteristics that will
be deﬁned below. Einstein’s summation convention is
∇µ means covariant
used in the equation; the notation
derivative with respect to the variable xµ. Throughout
this note greek indices and superscripts take values be-
tween 0 and 3 and roman indices run from 1 to 3. For
the moment the elements gµν are treated as real and the
function ψ as complex, although further along the equa-
tion will have to be generalized to accept other entities;
in every situation gµν incorporates some form of feedback
from the function ψ, characterizing what we will desig-
nate by dynamic space. Equation (1) can be associated
with the Lagrangian density

In a large number of situations we will not have to dis-
tinguish between covariant and partial derivatives, but
the cases we analyze at the end of the paper make this
distinction necessary.

We are not in a position to give a general solution to
this equation but will instead discuss various particular
solutions in order to understand how it becomes funda-
mental in generating the basic laws of physics. As a
starting point we discuss the solution ψ = exp(ipαxα).
Notice that if gµν is replaced by the metric ηµν /m2,
with ηµν = diag(1,
1) the Minkowski metric,
1,
the equation is equivalent to the Klein-Gordon equation,
so that we need only to verify that gravitation is also
comprehended. The solutions of Klein-Gordon equation
include m in the exponent of ψ so that there feedback
from the solution of the equation to the space metric, a
characteristic of dynamic space. We will look at a more
general situation, assuming that the metric has the form

The pµ in Eq. (5) are the conjugate momenta in a space
whose metric is gµν; we call this space the dynamic space.
This designation is entirely appropriate since the space
metric includes the factor 1/m2, which will be associ-
ated with a particular dynamics. The concept of dynamic
space will become clearer further along, when we make
the transition to the more conventional observer space.

The relation between the conjugate momenta and the

coordinates is given as usual by [4]

pµ = gµνxν .

We stress that all the elements in the equations above
are pure numbers to which we have not attributed any
physical meaning. All the operations done so far are
purely mathematical,
including the concept of space;
there are no dimensions of any sort attributed to the
space characterized by the the metric just deﬁned.

The geodesic equations of any space can be found by

deﬁning a Lagrangian with constant value 1/2

and writing the associated Euler-Lagrange equations

Applying to dynamic space we get its geodesic equations

There is not much more we can do to the geodesic
equation without particularizing the form of n; we will
do that in the following paragraphs.

We will now consider the situation where n is sym-
metric in all three xi coordinates; this will be done by
(x1)2 + (x2)2 + (x3)2. We will

We are dealing here with a one body problem; we an-
ticipate that m is somehow linked to inertial mass. In a
more general situation, when multiple bodies participate
in the dynamics, the scaling parameter m will vary ac-
cording to which body is being considered. The use of
m as scaling parameter in Eq. (15) means that points of
the new space, which we will designate by observer space,
= 0;
can only be mapped to points in dynamic space if m
there will be points of observer space where m = 0; these
points will necessarily map to inﬁnity in dynamic space.
Anticipating the physical interpretation of the equations,
we will say that points of observer space where there is
no mass necessarily map to inﬁnity in dynamic space.

Now we can write the Lagrangian in the new coordi-

The last equation is still written on pure numbers but
we are now in position to bring in physical meaning and
units. Let us start with the concepts of length and time
and assume that we want to associate some length units
to the values of coordinate r and time units to the values
of coordinate t; we can do this by introducing arbitrary

dimensional factors such that r =

At this point it is important to link c to the speed of
light in vacuum. Photons have no mass and classically do
not participate in the dynamics; it comes as no surprise
that dynamic space is not applicable to photons, as long
as they are excluded from the dynamics. We can study
photon dynamics as a limiting case where the mass tends
to zero. Recalling Eq. (5), consider the special case where
m = 0 and (p0)2 = n2δij pipj; the 4-dimensional equation
becomes undetermined but we can write a 3-dimensional
counterpart

n2δij
(p0)

2 pipj = 1.

(24)

Proceeding as before to convert into observer space’s co-
ordinates but using p0 instead of m as the scaling param-
eter we get

Since both members are dimensionless we can choose
to express the ﬁrst member in terms of time dimensions
while the second member is expressed in distance dimen-

Equation (26) deﬁnes the worldline of a particle char-
acterized by (p0)2 = n2δijpipj; notice, though, that by
simultaneously making m = 0 Eq. (5) generates an inde-
termination and so we can say that Eq. (26) deﬁnes the
worldline of a massless particle. When both members are
divided by (dt)2, the ﬁrst member becomes the squared
velocity of a massless particle in the space whose metric
is given by Eq. (7).

Physical interpretation of Eqs. (19 to 21) becomes now
possible. The ﬁrst of these equations guarantees dt/ds
is ﬁnite and so dr/dt = (dr/ds)/(dt/ds) cannot grow
to inﬁnity; hence the velocity remains below the local
velocity of light. The second equation is almost Kepler’s
second law but the presence of n2 in the ﬁrst member
introduces a small perturbation which induces the well
known relativistic advance of the perihelium in closed
orbits.

≫

The last equation deserves more detailed analysis. As-
sume, for a start, that r
M so that the exponentials
become eﬀectively unity. The ﬁrst term in the second
member provides the compatibility with Newton’s dy-
namics by making the acceleration inversely proportional
to the second power of the distance between masses m
and M . The second term, however, introduces a short
distance correction which manifests itself only if J
= 0,
i.e.
if there is angular momentum. If r is of the same
order of magnitude as M or smaller there is strong de-
viation from Newton’s law but then other points have to
be considered. First of all we must realize that r = M is
the horizon of a black hole, so we are now discussing sit-
uations where physics is largely untested. On the other
hand, in the derivation of Eq. (8) it was assumed that
n was a slowly varying function, which is not clearly the
case for small values of r; in this situation the Christoﬀel
symbols cannot be neglected and a diﬀerent analysis is
called for.

One very important point results from the exponen-
tial form of n in Eq. (22) where the Newton potential
appears as exponent of the metric coeﬃcient g00; as a
consequence Schr¨odinger’s condition of zero Ricci tensor
in vacuum is not veriﬁed. This may mean that zero point
ﬁeld must be considered in the construction of the metric
for vacuum in the Universe’s dynamic space. In Ref. [2]
the author shows that the exponential form is related to
the evanescent ﬁeld of 4-dimensional waveguides; the fact
that the cited work uses pseudo-Euclidean space is of no
consequence in this respect, as we shall see later on. The
origin of the exponential dependence does not need to
be considered in the remainder of the present work if the
reader accepts it based on results rather than on physical
explanation.

III. DIRAC EQUATION

We want to show that the dynamic space concept is
entirely compatible with Dirac equation; the aim is to en-
sure that quantum mechanics and dynamic space merge
together ﬂawlessly, thus merging Quantum Mechanics
and gravitation.

We will start with the following form of Dirac equation

IV. THE POINT OF VIEW OF
4-DIMENSIONAL OPTICS

In Refs. [2, 3], 4DO is developed in 4-space with sig-
nature (+, +, +, +) and dt is deﬁned as being the line
element in that space. Here we take a more fundamental
standing, considering the source equation (1) in the case
where the metric deﬁnes a pseudo-Euclidean space, i.e.
with Euclidean tangent space; since at this stage we are
dealing with geometrical concepts, deprived of any phys-
ical interpretations, we are allowed to try any metric we
decide to choose and any space signature we like. Later
we will have to check if the geometrical concepts can be
given physical interpretations, similarly to what has been
done in section II.

Let us assume a metric of the form

proceeding as before, we arrive at the following Euler-
Lagrange equations:

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
Physical interpretation of Eq. (52) follows a line similar
to what was used in section II. Comparing to Eq. (23) it
becomes clear that we now have a negative acceleration
term which can become as important as the Newtonian
term when the radial velocity approaches c/√2, unless
the factor exp(2M/r) has become so large as to provide
compensation for the negative acceleration. This is a
situation that will only be found near a black hole, where
M and r have the same order of magnitude.

It is important to verify that Poisson equation is not
violated if the covariant Laplacian is used in place of the
usual one. The covariant Laplacian of a scalar function
f is evaluated as [6]

gµν

µνf =

∇

∂µ (√ggµν∂ν f ) .

(53)

gµν =

n2
m2 δµν ;

Using gµν deﬁned by Eq. (43) and evaluating the covari-
ant Laplacian of n given by Eq. (22) one gets

(43)

and insert this into Eq. (1). As before assume that m is a
constant and n is a slowly varying function of coordinates
1, 2 and 3; after simpliﬁcation it is

n2
m2 δµν ∂µν ψ =
Now we can try a solution ψ = exp(ipαxα), resulting in

ψ.

Neither Klein-Gordon or Dirac equation is compatible
with 4DO, basically due to the diﬀerent space signature.
With respect to Klein-Gordon equation, its 4DO counter-
part is obviously obtained from Eq. (1) when gµν = δµν .
In order to obtain a 4DO equation which accounts for
λµ in Dirac equation (33) such
spin we replace γκ
that

λµ by ακ

λµ∂µψλ = ψκ.

A procedure similar to what is used in textbooks to derive
Dirac equation’s solutions for a particle at rest [5] would
show that Eq, (55) has solutions of the form

that diﬀers substantially from the relativistic approach,
the latter being synthesized in the substitution pµ

4-dimensional waveguide [2]; if we compare Eq. (65) to
the radial equation obtained for gravity (51) we can im-
mediately ﬁnd obvious similarities. The electric potential
has a typical 1/r rule and consequently we will consider
V0 = 1 far away from any electric charges.

The two examples show that the deﬁnition in Eq. (58)
generates a metric whose geodesics are the worldlines of
particles under electromagnetic ﬁeld. Electrodynamics
is associated to space curvature, in much the same way
as gravity. In general one can deﬁne an electromagnetic
tensor akin to its relativistic counterpart

The exponential factor eqA0 will normally be too near
unity to be of any practical consequence in everyday situ-
ations. Note that Fµν has been deﬁned in observer space;
the transition between dynamic and observer spaces oc-
curs when we divide by q. Similarly to what we com-
mented about inertial mass, mapping between observer
and dynamic spaces implies the presence of an electric
charge.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK

7

The dynamic space concept, introduced in this paper
allows quantum mechanics and gravitation to be recon-
ciled under the umbrella of the same equations; this was
ﬁrst checked with Klein-Gordon equation, through the
deﬁnition of a gravitational law, already presented in
previous work.
It was shown that Klein-Gordon equa-
tion presumes dynamic space, while classical mechanics
is normally set in observer space. The compatibility of
Dirac equation with dynamic space and the new gravita-
tional law was also established.

4-dimensional optics was shown to be an alternative
dynamic space where both quantum and classical me-
chanics could be set with equivalent predictions to those
made in the more usual space-time for all but extreme
situations, implying a modiﬁcation of Dirac equation;
in this alternative space the new gravitational law was
shown to obey Poisson equation. The electrodynamics
of a charged particle was analyzed in 4-dimensional op-
tics and was shown to verify the modiﬁed Dirac equation
but also to be amenable to space curvature, similarly to
gravity.

The work presented in this paper is largely incomplete.
Several years and great eﬀort are needed to extrapolate
the conclusions to cases of mass and charge distribu-
tions, to draw cosmological consequences and to work
out the compatibility with the standard model of particle
physics. In this respect we believe that elementary par-
ticles must be seen as dynamic spaces on their own and
the space metrics generated by the solutions of the funda-
mental equations must then be converted into observer
space through suitable coordinate changes; suggestions
in this respect have already been made in Ref. [2] and
prior to that work mass has been shown to emerge from
4-dimensional guidance of a particle’s wavefunction [7].
The author believes that all physics must be revised un-
der the new perspectives and hopes to contribute to this
revision in future papers but this is task too big for a sin-
gle person to tackle; the present work, albeit incomplete,
should set the bases for anybody who feels motivated to
join in the eﬀort.

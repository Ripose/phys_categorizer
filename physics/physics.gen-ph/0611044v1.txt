THE CLAUSIUS INEQUALITY DOES NOT FOLLOW FROM THE
SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

ALEXEY GAVRILOV

Abstract. The example of macroscopic thermodynamical system violating
the Clausius inequality is presented.

1. The gap in the proof of the Clausius inequality

The well-known Clausius inequality

dQ
T

I

≤ 0

dS ≥

T

is supposed to be valid for any closed system undergoing a cycle. The more general
formulation of this inequality

is actually less clear because the deﬁnition of entropy for nonequilibrum systems is
a subject of controversa. The rigirous version of (2) is the so-called Clausius-Duhem
inequality

dQ
T
where A and B are equilibrum states.

The proof of (1) may be found in any textbook on thermodynamics. Consider a
system connected to a thermal energy reservour at a constant absolute temperature
of TB through a reversible cyclic device. It is also connected to a work consumer
(this system is necessary but usually not mentioned) (ﬁg. 1).

to the work. But the Kelvin-Plank statement of the second law states that it is
impossible to take heat from one system, to give work to another system and to
make no changes in any other system. Thus we have a contradiction.

In this proof it is implicitely assumed that we may complete the cycle without
making any changes in any system except for the four systems shown in ﬁg.1.
However, as we shall see, this assumption may be wrong.

2. The adiabatic process should not be an isentropic one

The xenium is a gas whose molecules may be in two diﬀerent states with the
same energy levels. The spontaneous transitions between this states are very rare.
However two suﬃciently close molecules may exchange their states. It does’n matter
whether the xenium exists. The question is whether the existance of a gas with
these properties violates some law of nature or not. In author’s opinion, it does
not.

If in xenium the number of molecules in one of states is more then in another
state then we may consider this metastable gas as a mixture of, say, xenium-1 and
xenium-2. Let us consider the vessel of xenium-1 and another one of equilibrum
xenium at the same temperature. Two vessels are separated by the membrane
which is thin and don’t prevent molecules from interacting (ﬁg. 2).

Then the equilibrum xenium will be enriched with xenim-1 and entropy of this
gas will decrease without any heat ﬂow. The only explanation of this paradox
is the conclusion: entropy may be transferred from one system to another system
adiabatically.

Taking into account this process, the inequality (2) should be replaced by

dQ
T
where dI is entropy absorbed by the system ”by the direct way”. The inequality
(1) takes the form

+ dI,

dS ≥

≤ 0.

If I < 0 then (1) may be violated.

3. Semiperpetuum mobile

To build a system violating (1) we have to use some extra tricks. The most
simple is a selective membrane which is permeable for xenium-1 only (it may be
replaced by a substance reacting with xenium-1, this is less convenient but more
realistic). This membrane is thick and don’t allow molecules to interact through it.

THE CLAUSIUS INEQUALITY DOES NOT FOLLOW FROM THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS3

Our perpetuum mobile of the second kind is a cylinder with a piston on one
side, closed with a thin membrane on the other side. The cylinder is divided into
two parts by a selective membrane. The volume between two membranes is ﬁlled
by xenium (ﬁg. 3). This device has a straight connection to a heat reservour and
works isothermically. Besides, we have two large reservours with xenium-1 one and
with xenium-2 another.

At the begining of the cycle the piston is pushed to the selective membrane and
the gas is in equilibrum. Then the device is connected to the reservour with xenium-
1 for some time, so the gas in the cylinder becames enriched with xenium-1. Then
the isothermic expansion follows. After the expansion ends the device is connected
to the reservour with xenium-2 until the number of molecules in two states in all
the cylinder becames equal. The isothermic compression completes the cycle.

Note that the working gas is the xenium-1 only. The expansion takes place
at higher (partial) pressure of xenium-1 then the compression. Hence this device
produces the work and consumes the heat, violating the inequality (1). However,
no contradiction to the second law arises because entropy of reservours increases.

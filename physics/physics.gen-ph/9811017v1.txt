Abstract

We consider several models with metrics type FRW, with k = 0 and
with a generic equation of state, p = ωρ, furthermore, we take into
account the conservation principle of the energy-momentum tensor,
div(Tij ) = 0, but with G and Λ variable. We ﬁnd trivially, a set
of solutions through dimensional analysis. We emphasize that, G ∝
t1+3ω, i.e. it depend on the state equation and Λ ∝ t−2 in any case.

Introduction.

Recently have been studied several models with metrics FRW in those which
are considered to the ”constants” G and Λ as dependent functions of the
time t.([1]). In this paper we want to emphasize as the use of the dimensional
analysis permits us to ﬁnd in a trivial way a set of solutions to this type of
models, but with k = 0, and taking into account the conservation principle.
To emphasize furthermore, that the variation of G that is obtained in this
type of solutions is always proportional to the time (depending on the state
equation) and that Λ is always inversely proportional to t−2 independently
of the state equation that we impose (p = ωρ / ω = const.).

The paper is organized as follows: In the second paragraph we present
the equations of the model and are made some small considerations on the
followed dimensional method (address to reader to the classic literature on
the topic ([2])).
In the third paragraph we make use of the dimensional
analysis ( Pi theorem) to obtain a solution to the principal quantities that
appear in the model and ﬁnally in the fourth paragraph we end with a short
recapitulation and succinct conclusions.

The modiﬁed ﬁeld equations are:

8πG(t)

Tij

(1)

and we impose that

div(Tij) = 0

where Λ(t) represents the cosmological constant. The basic ingredients of
the model are:

1. The line element is deﬁned by:

ds2 = −c2dt2 + f 2(t)

dr2
1 − kr2 + r2

"

dθ2 + sin 2θdφ2
(cid:16)

#

(cid:17)

here only we will consider the case k = 0

2. The energy-momentum tensor is deﬁned by:

Tij = (ρ + p)uaub − pgij

p = ωρ

The ﬁeld equations, already developed, in function of the metric g ∈
T 0
2 (M) of type FRW are (provided that the energy-momentum tensor repre-
sent to a perfect ﬂuid):

integrating the equation (4) we obtain the following equation.

ρ = Aωf −3(ω+1)

where f represents the scale factor that appears in the metrics and Aω is the
constant of integration that depends on the state equation that is imposed.
The dimensional analysis that we apply needs to make the following dis-
tinctions. We need to know beforehand the set of fundamental quantity, in
this case it is solely the cosmic time t as is detached of the homogeneity
and isotropy of the model and to distinguish the set of constants, universal
and unavoidable or characteristic, that in this case, they are respectively the
speed of the light c and the constant of integration Aω that depending on the
state equation that is imposed, it will have diﬀerent dimensions and physical
meaning.

In a previous paper ([3]) was calculated the dimensional base of this type
of models, being this B = {L, M, T, θ} where θ represents the dimension
of the temperature. The corresponding dimensions of each quantity (with
respect to this base B) are

[t] = T

[c] = LT −1

[Aω] = L2+3ωMT −2

All the quantities that we go to calculate we will make it exclusively in
function of the cosmic time t and of the unavoidable constants, c and Aω
with respect to a dimensional base B = {L, M, T, θ} .

3 Solutions through D.A.

We go to calculate through dimensional analysis D.A. the variation of G(t)
in function so much of t as of the temperature θ, G(θ) ([4]), the energy
density ρ(t), the radius of the universe f (t), the temperature θ(t), as well as
to entropy s(t) and the entropy density S(t) and ﬁnally Λ(t).

3.1 Calculation of G(t)

As we have indicated more up, we go to accomplish the calculate applying the
Pi theorem. The magnitude that we consider are G = G(t, c, Aω) with respect
to a dimensional base B = {L, M, T, θ} . We know that [G] = L3M −1T −2

the cases more well-known are:

1. radiation predominance ω = 1

2. matter predominance ω = 0

If we consider ρ as bulk density then Aω represents the bulk of the uni-

verse, the formulation (6) remains therefore

this formulate verify the kwon Sciamas formulate: ρGt2 ≈ 1 (about the
Mach‘s principle). Furthermore if we take into account the numerical values
of the constant and of the magnitude t we obtain the current value of G ≈
10−10.1757m3kg−1s−2 i.e. t ≈ 1020s, c ≈ 108.5ms−1 and Aω ≈ 1056kg.

If ω = − 1

3 then G = const. though this possibility is physically unrealistic.

If ω < − 1

3 then G will vary in a way inversely proportional to the time.
If we want to relate G with θ (ver [4]) the solution that the D.A. provide
is: G = G(t, c, Aω, a, θ). We need to introduce a new constant, in this case

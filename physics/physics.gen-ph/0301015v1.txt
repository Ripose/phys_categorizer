Abstract

It is argued that a noncommutative geometry of spacetime leads to
a reconciliation of electromagnetism and gravitation while providing
an underpinning to Weyl’s geometry. It also leads to a cosmology con-
sistent with observation. A few other ramiﬁcations are also examined.

1 Introduction

The Theory of Relativity (Special and General) and Quantum Theory have
been often described as the two pillars of twentieth century physics. Yet it
was almost as if Rudyard Kipling’s ”The twain shall never meet” was true for
these two intellectual achievements. For decades there have been fruitless at-
tempts to unify electromagnetism and gravitation, or Quantum Theory and
General Relativity. As Wheeler put it [1], the problem has been, how to incor-
porate curvature into Quantum Theory or spin half into General Relativity.
At the same time it is also remarkable that both these disparate theories share
one common platform: An underlying diﬀerentiable space time manifold, be
it the Reimannian spacetime of General Relativity or the Minkowski space-
time of Relativistic Quantum Theory (including Quantum Field Theory).
However this underlying common feature has been questioned by Quantum
Gravity on the one hand and Quantum SuperStrings on the other, which
try to unify these two branches (Cf.ref.[2] and several references therein).
We will now argue that uniﬁcation and a geometrical structure for Quantum
Theory are possible if diﬀerentiable spacetime is discarded in favour of fuzzy

1

spacetime. At the same time this has many ramiﬁcations and leads to a
cosmology which is consistent with the latest iconoclastic observations, for
example that the universe is accelerating and expanding for ever while the
ﬁne structure constant seems to be changing with time.

2 Quantum Geometry

One of the earliest attempts to unify electromagnetism and gravitation, was
Weyl’s gauge invariant geometry. The basic idea was [3] that while

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν

Φµdxµ

was invariant under arbitrary transformations in General Relativity, a further
invariant, namely,

which is a linear form should be introduced. gµν in (1) would represent the
gravitational potential, and Φµ of (2) would represent the electromagnetic
ﬁeld potential. As Weyl observed, ”The world is a 3 + 1 dimensional metrical
manifold; all physical ﬁeld - phenomena are expressions of the metrics of
the world. (Whereas the old view was that the four-dimensional metrical
continuum is the scene of physical phenomena; the physical essentialities
themselves are, however, things that exist ”in” this world, and we must
accept them in type and number in the form in which experience gives us
cognition of them: nothing further is to be ”comprehended” of them.)
This was a bold step, because it implied the relativity of magnitude multiplied
eﬀectively on all components of the metric tensor gµν by an arbitrary function
of the coordinates. However, the uniﬁcation was illusive because the gµν and
Φµ were really independent elements[4].
A more modern treatment is recapitulated below [5].
The above arbitrary multiplying factor is normalised and we require that,

”

For the invariance of (3), gµν transforms now as a tensor density of weight mi-
nus half, rather than as a tensor in the usual theory. The covariant derivative
now needs to be redeﬁned as

This ﬁnally leads to (Cf.ref.[5] for details).

Φµ in (5) is identiﬁed with the electromagnetic potential, while gµν gives the
gravitational potential as in the usual theory. The aﬃne connection is now
given by

(6)

The essential point, and this was the original criticism of Einstein and others,
is that in (6), gµν and Φµ are independent entities.
Let us now analyze the above from a diﬀerent perspective. Let us write
the product dxµdxν of (1) as a sum of half its anti-symmetric part and half
the symmetric part. The invariant line element in (1) now becomes (hµν +
¯hµν)dxµdxν where h and ¯h denote the anti-symmetric and symmetric parts
respectively of g. h would vanish unless the commutator

[dxµ, dxν]

l being some fundamental minimum length. In this case, under reﬂection,
hµν as in the case of the tensor density metric tensor above.
hµν → −
To proceed further, we observe that the noncommutative geometry given in
(7) was studied by Snyder and others. In this case it has been shown in detail
by the author [6, 7] that under an inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation of the
wave function,

we get

ψ′ >= U(R)

ψ >

∂
∂xj

ψ′(xj) = [1 + ıǫ(ıǫljkxk

) + 0(ǫ2)]ψ(xj)

Equation (9) has been shown to lead to the Dirac equation when l is the
Compton wavelength. Indeed, Dirac himself had noted that his electron equa-
tion needed an average over spacetime intervals of the order of the Compton
scale to remove zitterbewegung eﬀects and give meaningful physics. This
again has recently been shown to be symptomatic of an underlying fuzzy
spacetime described by a noncommutative space time geometry (7) [8].

γ(µ)x(µ)
The point here is that under equation (7), the coordinates xµ
where the brackets with the superscript denote the fact that there is no sum-
mation over the indices. Infact, in the theory of the Dirac equation it is well
known [9].that,

represented by

where σ’s are the Pauli matrices. As noted by Bade and Jehle (Cf.ref.[9]), we
could take the σ’s or γ’s in (10) and (11) as the components of a contravariant
world vector, or equivalently one could take them to be ﬁxed matrices, and
to maintain covariance, to attribute new transformation properties to the
wave function, which now becomes a spinor (or bi-spinor). This latter has
been the traditional route, because of which the Dirac wave function has its
bi-spinorial character. In this latter case, the coordinates retain their usual
commutative character. It is only when we consider the equivalent former
alternative, that we return to the noncommutative geometry (7).
That is in the usual commutative spacetime the Dirac spinorial wave func-
tions conceal the noncommutative character (7).
Indeed we can verify all these considerations in a simple way as follows:
First let us consider the usual space time. This time the Dirac wave function
is given by

ψ =

χ
Θ !

,

 

where χ and Θ are spinors. It is well known that under reﬂection while the
χ, χ being the
so called positive energy spinor Θ behaves normally, χ
so called negative energy spinor which comes into play at the Compton scale
[10]. Because of this property as shown in detail [7], there is now a covariant
derivative given by, in units, ¯h = c = 1,

Aµ in (13)is now identiﬁed with the electromagnetic potential, exactly as in
Weyl’s theory.
What all this means is that the so called ad hoc feature in Weyl’s uniﬁcation
theory is really symptomatic of the underlying noncommutative space time
geometry (7). Given (7) we get both gravitation and electromagnetism in a
uniﬁed picture.
Let us now consider the above ideas in the context of the deBroglie-Bohm
formulation [11]. We start with the Schrodinger equation

Using the theory of ﬂuid ﬂow, it is well known that (16) and (17) lead to the
Bohm alternative formulation of Quantum Mechanics. In this theory there
is a hidden variable namely the deﬁnite value of position while the so called
Bohm potential Q can be non local, two features which do not ﬁnd favour
with physicists.
It must be noted that in Weyl’s geometry, even in a Euclidean space there is
a covariant derivative and a non vanishing curvature R.
Santamato [12, 13, 14] exploits this latter fact, within the context of the
deBroglie-Bohm theory and postulates a Lagrangian given by

L(q, ˙q, t) = Lc(q, ˙q, t) + γ(¯h2/m)R(q, t),

5

He then goes on to obtain the equations of motion like (14),(15), etc. by
invoking an Averaged Least Action Principle

As can be seen from the above, the Quantum potential Q is now given in
terms of the scalar curvature R.
We have already related the arbitrary functions Φ of Weyl’s formulation with
a noncommutative spacetime geometry (7).
This legitimises Santamato’s postulative approach of extending the deBroglie-
Bohm formulation.
At an even more fundamental level, this formalism gives us the rationale for
the deBroglie wave length itself. Because of the noncommutative geometry
in (7) space becomes multiply connected, in the sense that a closed circuit
cannot be shrunk to a point within the interval. Let us consider the simplest
case of double connectivity. In this case, if the interval is of length λ, we will
have,

In (22), the circuit integral was over a circle of diameter λ. Equation (23)
shows the emergence of the deBroglie wavelength. This follows from the
noncommutative geometry of space time, rather than the physical Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle. Remembering that Γ in (22) stands for the angular
momentum, this is also the origin of the Wilson-Sommerfeld quantization
rule, an otherwise mysterious Quantum Mechanical prescription.
What we have done is to develop a Quantum Geometry, based on (7).

3 Cosmology

In recent years the work of Perlmutter and co-workers has shown that the
universe is not only not descelerating, it is actually accelerating, and would
continue to expand for ever. The work of Webb and co-workers on the other
hand brings out an equally iconoclastic observation: The hallowed ﬁne struc-
ture constant is actually slowly decreasing with time. Suddenly dark matter
has been discarded in favour of dark energy and a cosmological constant.
We ﬁrst observe that the concept of a Zero Point Field (ZPF) or Quantum
Vacuum (or Ether) is an idea whose origin can be traced back to Max Planck
himself. Quantum Field Theory attributes the ZPF to the virtual Quantum
Eﬀects of an already present electromagnetic ﬁeld. There is another ap-
proach, sometimes called Stochastic Electrodynamics which treats the ZPF
as primary and attributes to it Quantum Mechanical eﬀects [15, 16]. It may
be observed that the ZPF results in the well known experimentally veriﬁed
Casimir eﬀect [17, 18]. We would also like to point out that contrary to pop-
ular belief, the concept of Ether has survived over the decades through the
works of Dirac, Vigier, Prigogine, String Theorists like Wilzeck and others
[19]-[27]. It appears that even Einstein himself continued to believe in this
concept [28].
We would ﬁrst like to observe that the energy of the ﬂuctuations in the
background electromagnetic ﬁeld could lead to the formation of elementary
particles.
Infact it is known that this energy of ﬂuctuation in a region of
length l is given by [1]

B2

¯hc
l4

∼
In the above if l is taken to be the Compton wavelength of a typical ele-
mentary particle, then we recover its energy mc2, as can be easily veriﬁed.
It may be mentioned that Einstein himself had believed that the electron
was a result of such condensation from the background electromagnetic ﬁeld
(Cf.[11] for details). Infact this formation of particles could be likened to the
formation of Benard cells in a phase transition [29], as we will see brieﬂy in
the next section. We also take the pion to represent a typical elementary
particle, as in the literature.
To proceed, as there are N

1080 such particles in the universe, we get

(24)

∼

Nm = M

7

where M is the mass of the universe.
In the following we will use N as the sole cosmological parameter.
Equating the gravitational potential energy of the pion in a three dimensional
isotropic sphere of pions of radius R, the radius of the universe, with the rest
energy of the pion, we can deduce the well known relation [11]

where M can be obtained from (24).
We now use the fact that given N particles, the ﬂuctuation in the particle
number is of the order √N [30], while a typical time interval for the ﬂuctua-
¯h/mc2, the Compton time. We will come back to this point later.
tions is
So we have

∼

whence on integration we get,

We can easily verify that equation (26) is indeed satisﬁed where T is the age
of the universe. Next by diﬀerentiating (25) with respect to t we get

where H in (27) can be identiﬁed with the Hubble Constant, and using (25)
is given by,

Equation (24), (25) and (26) show that in this formulation, the correct mass,
radius and age of the universe can be deduced given N as the sole cosmolog-
ical or large scale parameter. Equation (28) can be written as

Equation (29) has been empirically known as an ”accidental” or ”mysterious”
relation. As observed by Weinberg[31], this is unexplained: it relates a single

cosmological parameter H to constants from microphysics. We will touch
upon this micro-macro nexus again. In our formulation, equation (29) is no
longer a mysterious coincidence but rather a consequence.
As (28) and (27) are not exact equations but rather, order of magnitude

This is consistent with observation and shows that

has been a puzzle, the so called cosmological constant problem [32]. But it
is explained here.

ZPF), there is an excess electrical potential energy of the electron, which
infact we have identiﬁed as its inertial energy. That is [30],

On using (25) in the above, we recover the well known Gravitation-electromagnetism

or without using (25), we get, instead, the well known so called Eddington
formula,

we get,

where in (32), we have used (26). Following Dirac (cf.also [33]) we treat G as
the variable, rather than the quantities m, l, cand¯h (which we will call micro
physical constants) because of their central role in atomic (and sub atomic)
physics.
Next if we use G from (32) in (28), we can see that

(30)

(31)

(33)

Thus apart from the fact that H has the same inverse time dependance on
T as G, (33) shows that given the microphysical constants, and N, we can

(34) and (35) are consistent with observation.
The above model predicts an ever expanding and possibly accelerating uni-
verse whose density keeps decreasing. This seemed to go against the accepted
idea that the density of the universe equalled the critical density required for
closure.
The above cosmology exhibits a time variation of the gravitational constant
of the form

Indeed this is true in a few other schemes also, including Dirac’s cosmology
(Cf. [34]). Interestingly it can be shown that such a time variation can ex-
plain the precession of the perihelion of Mercury (Cf.[35]). It can also provide
an alternative explanation for dark matter and the bending of light while the
Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation is also explained (Cf.[11]).
It is also possible to deduce the existence of gravitational waves given (36).
To see this quickly let us consider the Poisson equation for the metric gµν

2gµν = Gρuµuν

(37)

∇
The solution of (37) is given by

gµν = G

Indeed equations similar to (37) and (38) hold for the Newtonian gravita-
tional potential also. If we use the second time derivative of G from (36)
in (38), along with (37), we can immediately obtain the D’alembertian wave
equation for gravitational waves, instead of the Poisson equation:

(38)

where D is the D’alembertian.
Recently a small variation with time of the ﬁne structure constant has been

detected and reconﬁrmed by Webb and coworkers [36, 37]. This observation
is consistent with the above cosmology. We can see this as follows. We use
an equation due to Kuhne [38]

which is the same as Webb’s result.
We give another derivation of (42) in the above context wherein, as the num-
ber of particles in the universe increases with time, we go from the Planck
scale to the Compton scale.
This can be seen as follows: In equation (30), if the number of particles in
the universe, N = 1, then the mass m would be the Planck mass. In this
case the classical Schwarzschild radius of the Planck mass would equal its
Quantum Mechanical Compton wavelength. To put it another way, all the
energy would be gravitational (Cf.[11] for details). However as the number
of particles N increases with time, according to (26), gravitation and elec-
tromagnetism get diﬀerentiated and we get (30) and the Compton scale.
It is known that the Compton length, due to zitterbewegung causes a cor-
rection to the electrostatic potential which an orbiting electron experiences,
rather like the Darwin term [10].

(44) is an equivalent form of (42) (Cf.ref.[38, 39]), and is the result originally
obtained by Webb et al (Cf.refs.[39, 40]).
Infact there is another test for the variation of G.We would now like to show
that this model also explains the observed decrease in the orbital period of
the binary pulsar PSR 1913 + 16, otherwise attributed to as yet undetected
gravitational waves [40].
In general in schemes in which G the universal constant of gravitation de-
creases with time, it is to be expected that gradually the size of the orbit
and the time period would increase, with an overall decrease in energy. In
any case all this becomes more relevant in the light of the above latest ob-
servations about the ﬁne structure constant.
But in the present case as we will show, the gravitational energy of the binary
system, GM m
remains constant, where M is the mass of the central object
and L the mean distance between the objects. This is because the decrease
in G is compensated by an increase in the material content of the system,
according to the above model.
In fact the energy lost is given by GM
T L (per unit mass of the orbiting object -
in any case the mass of the orbiting object does not feature in the dynamical
equations). Further from what we saw 1
T particles appear from the
√N τ
Quantum Vacuum per second, per particle in the universe. So the energy
gained in this process is GM
m,
where n is the number of typical elementary particles in the central body and
m their mass.
As can be seen from the above the energy lost per second is compensated
by the energy gained and thus the total gravitational energy of the binary
system remains constant.
Let us now consider an object revolving about another object, as in the case
of the binary pulsar. The gravitational energy of the system is now given by,

T L per second. This follows, if we write M = n

the orbital period. Before proceeding further we note that such a decrease
in the orbital period has been observed in the case of binary pulsars [40, 41].

It may be remarked that this same eﬀect has been interpreted as being due
to gravitational radiation, even though there are some objections to the cal-
culation in this case (Cf.ref.[41]).
We will now try to explain the Pioneer spacecrafts’ large anomalous acceler-
ation which has been studied for several years by Anderson and co-workers
and has remained a long standing puzzle [42].
From the energy conservation in central orbits, viz.,

It has also been argued that these scaled Compton wavelengths and scaled

For example from (66) it follows that

Whence we get (57).
While equations (60)-(63), resemble the Random Walk relations, this is not
accidental.
Let us start with Nelson’s well known equation of diﬀusion

∆k2 = ν∆t,

ν =

h
m

where ν is the diﬀusion constant, h the Planck constant and m the mass of
a typical elementary particle like pion. We can see immediately from (67)
that for velocities

We recover the Compton wavelength (or more generally the deBroglie wave-
length). Further it can be shown that from (67) we can recover the Random
Walk equation (63) [45] deﬁne scaled diﬀusion constant to be νı. Using (67)

(68) is a diﬀusion equation at diﬀerent scales. This in turn leads to equations
(60) - (64), a similar one for the KBO, which were to start with empirical
relations. The interesting point is that starting from (67) (or (68)), we can
infact deduce the Schrodinger equation - either by using the Lagrangian, as
is known, or even without invoking a Lagrangian (Cf.Appendix):

(69)

This provides a rationale for the scaled Compton lengths or scaled deBroglie
lenghs referred to above.
Let us investigate the above considerations in a little more detail.
For this, we observe that the creation of particles from a Quantum vacuum
(or pre space time) has been described in the references cited [46, 47].
It
can be done within the context of the above Nelsonian Theory, in complete
analogy with the creation of Benard cells at the critical point. The Nelsonian-
Brownian process as described in (67) deﬁnes, ﬁrst the Planck length, the
shortest possible length and then the random process leads to the Compton
scale (Cf.ref.[45]). This process is as noted (Cf.ref.[47]) a complete analogue
of the phase transition associated with the Landau-Ginsburg equation [48]

The parallel is not yet fully apparent, if we compare (70) and the Schrodinger

infact the correlation length from (70) is given by

which can be easily reduced to the Compton wavelength. In other words,
the Schrodinger equation (69), via (71) describes the creation of particles, a
la Benard cells in a Landau-Ginsburg like phase transition.
As is known, the interesting aspects of the critical point theory (Cf.ref.[48,

ξ = (

49]) are universality and scale. Broadly, this means that diverse physical
phenomena follow the same route at the critical point, on the one hand, and
on the other this can happen at diﬀerent scales, as exempliﬁed for example,
by the course graining techniques of the renormalization group. To highlight
this point we note that in critical point phenomena we have the reduced order
parameter ¯Q and the reduced correlation length bar ¯ξ. Near the critical point
we have relations like (Cf.ref.[49])

In other words the scaled Planck eﬀects and the scaled Random Walk eﬀects
as typiﬁed by equations like (56)-(64) are the result of a critical point phase
transition and subsequent course graining.

5 Discussion

1.In some ways the General Relativistic gravitational ﬁeld resembles the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, particularly in certain approximations, as for example
when the ﬁeld is stationary or nearly so and the velocities are small. In this
case the equations of General Relativity can be put into a form resembling
those of Maxwell’s Theory, and then the ﬁelds have been called Gravitoelec-
tric and Gravitomagnetic [50]. Experiments have also been suggested for
measuring the Gravitomagnetic force components for the earth [51].
We can ask whether such a consideration can be applied to elementary parti-
cles, if in fact they can be considered in the context of General Relativity. It
may be mentioned that apart from Quantum Gravity, there have been three
diﬀerent approaches for studying elementary particles via General Relativity

18

[52, 53, 11] and references therein. We will now show that it is possible to
extend the Gravitomagnetic and Gravitoelectric formulations to elementary
particles within the framework of the theory developed in [11].
In [11], the linearized General Relativistic equations are seen to describe the
properties of elementary particles, such as spin, mass, charge and even the
very Quantum Mechanical anomalous gyromagnetic ratio g = 2, apart from
several other characteristics [54, 55, 56, 57].
We merely report that the linearized equations of General Relativity, viz.,

where as usual,

lead to the mass, spin, gravitational potential and charge of an electron, if
we work at the Compton scale (Cf.ref.[11] for details). Let us now apply
the macro Gravitoelectic and Gravitomagnetic equations to the above case.
Infact these equations are (Cf.ref.[50]).

The subscripts g in the equations (75), (76), (77) are to indicate that the
ﬁelds E and H in the macro case do not really represent the Electromagnetic
ﬁeld, but rather resemble them. Let us apply equation (76) to equation (73),
keeping in mind equation (77). We then get, considering only the order of

We now observe that (80) does not really contain the mass of the elementary
particle. Could we get a further insight into this new force?
Indeed in the above linearized General Relativistic characterisation of the
electron,
it turns out that the electron can be represented by the Kerr-
Newman metric (Cf.[11] for details). This incidentally also gives the anoma-
lous gyromatgnetic ratio g = 2. This result has recently been reconﬁrmed
by Nottale [58] from a totally diﬀerent point of view, using scaled relativity.
It is well known that the Kerr-Newman ﬁeld has extra electric and magnetic
terms (Cf.[59]), both of the order 1
It may be asked if there is any candidate as yet for the above short range
force. There is already one such candidate - the inexplicable B(3) [60] force
mediated by massive photons and of short range, ﬁrst detected in 1992 at
Cornell and since conﬁrmed by subsequent experiments. (It diﬀers from the
usual B(1) and B(2) ﬁelds of special relativity, mediated as they are, by mass-
less photons.)
Interestingly, if we work with a massive vector ﬁeld we can recover (79) and
(80)[61].
In this case there is an upper limit on the mass of the photon

r3 , exactly as indicated in (80).

A Final Comment: It is quite remarkable that equations like (75), (76) and
(77) which resemble the equations of electromagnetism, have in the usual
macro considerations no connection whatsoever with electromagnetism ex-
cept in appearance. This would seem to be a rather miraculous coincidence.
In fact the above considerations of section 2 and linearized General Rela-
tivistic theory of the electron as also the Kerr-Newman metric formulation,
demonstrate that the resemblence to electromagnetism is not an accident,
because in this latter formulation, both electromagnetism and gravitation
arise from the metric (Cf.also refs.[62, 54, 55, 11]).
2. Newman deduced the now famous Kerr-Newman metric alluded to nearly
40 years ago [63, 64]. There were two inexplicable features. The ﬁrst was,

48g.

20

the use of complex coordinates, and why such coordinates somehow represent
spin.
The second puzzling feature was, why should this General Relativistic metric
so closely describe the anomalous gyro magnetic ratio, g = 2 [65, 1].
The diﬃculty is best brought out by the fact that the Kerr-Newman met-
ric when applied to the electron throws up a naked singularity, when the
distances become complex which is a reversal of the above situation, where
complex coordinates were introduced in the ﬁrst place.
We will now ﬁrst see, why complex coordinates arise at all, and what the
ramiﬁcations are: In the process we will get the answers to the above two
puzzling questions.
To elaborate the above considerations, the horizon of the Kerr-Newman met-
ric becomes, for the electron complex:

r =

GM
c2 + ıb, b

G2Q2
c8 + a2

≡  

G2M 2

1/2

−

c4 !

However it should be noticed that the coordinates for a Dirac particle is given
by

x = (c2p1H −

1t) +

cp1H −

1)H −

1

ı
2

c¯h(α1 −

Interestingly the imaginary terms in both (81) and (82) are of the same or-
¯h
mc of the electron. For the complex
der, namely the Compton wavelength,
or non-Hermitian coordinate in (82) Dirac had argued [66, 67] that our mea-
surements of space time intervals are imprecise and infact averaged over the
order of the Compton scale, and once such averages are taken, the imaginary
or zitterbewegung term disappears, and we return to real or Hermitian co-
ordinates.
Infact in Dirac’s theory the operator dx ≡
and is given by

d
dx is a purely imaginary operator,

δx(dx + ¯dx) = δx2dx ¯dx = 0

if

as is tacitly assumed. However if

(81)

(82)

(83)

then the operator dx becomes complex, and therefore, also the momentum
ı¯hdx and the position operator. In other words if (83) holds
operator, px ≡

0(δx2) = 0

0(δx2)

= 0

21

6
good then we have to deal with complex or non-Hermitian coordinates. The
implication of this is that (Cf.[54] for details) space time becomes non- com-
mutative as we saw in (7).
We also saw that this leads directly to the Dirac equation at the Compton
scale.
In any case here is the mysterious origin of the complex coordinates and spin.
The complex coordinates lead to the Kerr-Newman metric and the electron’s
ﬁeld including the anomalous gyro magnetic ratio which are symptomatic of
the electron’s spin. It also means that the naked singularity is shielded by the
fuzzy spacetime (Dirac’s original averages over the zitterbewegung interval
or equivalently the noncommutative geometry (7).
i) It may be noticed that while the original General Relativistic and Kerr-
Newman formulations were for the macro universe, we on the other hand
have applied it to the micro world.
ii). Once complex coordinates are introduced, as noted by Newman there is
a change of character [65]: ”Notice that the magnetic moment µ = ea can
be thought of as the imaginary part of the charge times the displacement of
the charge into the complex region.... We can think of the source as having
a complex center of charge and that the magnetic moment is the moment of
charge about the center of charge....In other words the total complex angular
momentum vanishes around any point za on the complex world-line. From
this complex point of view the spin angular momentum is identical to orbital,
arising from an imaginary shift of origin rather than a real one... If one again
considers the particle to be ”localized” in the sense that the complex center
of charge coincides with the complex center of mass, one again obtains the
Dirac gyromagnetic ratio...”
Infact this above complexiﬁcation of coordinates has also been worked out by
Kaiser [68, 69], but for the Dirac electron. Kaiser found that such a complex-
iﬁcation eliminates the unphysical zitterbewegung. Dirac himself had noted
that zitterbewegung was a manifestation of the fact that while in a physical
sense our space time intervals cannot be made arbitrarily small, in theory we
consider point intervals, so that as noted above, once an averaging over the
Compton scale is performed, zitterbewegung disappears.
What we would like to stress here is that, the complexiﬁcation carried out
by Newman or Kaiser were mathematical devices - the physical motivation
or ramiﬁcation was unclear. We argue that complexiﬁcation is symptomatic
of the fuzzy nature of spacetime at the micro scale.
iii). Interestingly the complexiﬁcation of coordinates can also be related to

22

an underpinning of a Nelsonian-stochastic process [70].
3. Interestingly we can purse the reasoning of section 4, equations (57) ﬀ to
the case of terrestrial phenomena. Let us consider a gas at standard tem-
1023 per
perature and pressure. In this case, the number of molecules n
cubic centimeter, so that r
1cm and with the same l, we can get a ”scaled”
Planck constant ˜h
In this case, a simple application of the WKB approximation, leads im-
mediately from the Schrodinger equation at the new scale to the classical
Hamilton-Jacobi theory, that is to classical mechanics.

APPENDIX

As mentioned on using the double Weiner process and Newtonian mechan-
ics, it is possible to derive the Schrodinger equation - this is the derivation
of Quantum Mechanics from the Nelsonian stochastic theory. Let us brieﬂy
review the steps in this derivation. We ﬁrst start with the backward and
forward time derivatives in the double Weiner process,

Next we use the fact that if ρ(~r, t) is the probability density at ~r(t), then
as demonstrated by Kolmogorov, for the above Weiner process and more
generally any Markov process, we have forward and backward Fokker-Planck
equations

In the usual approach we deﬁne the complex velocity

and on using a suitable Lagrangian derived from Newtonian Mechanics we
deduce the Schrodinger equation for details). In any case it is to be noted
that if the velocity U as given in (86) or (88) vanishes, that is the backward
and forward time derivatives become equal, there is no double Weiner process
and we have the usual Classical Theory, with ν = 0. So Quantum Mechanics
is contained in U).
Let us now not take recourse to Newtonian Mechanics, but merely deﬁne a
function S such that

Using equations (88) and (89) it is possible to deﬁne a complex velocity
potential ψ given by

We get the same ψ in the usual stochastic theory (as also in the hydrodynam-
ical formulation), as can be easily veriﬁed. We now observe that substitution
of V in terms of ψ from (90) in the equation of continuity (87) immediately
leads to

2m∇
(91) can be seen to be the free particle Schrodinger equation. We have not
however used Newtonian Mechanics in the derivation of (91). In the usual
Nelsonian Theory also, (91) is deduced, though via a Lagrangian.

If we now specialise to energy momentum eigen states, in the Quantum Me-

(92)

which expresses Newtonian Mechanics, as obtained from stochastic consid-
erations. (For example a time derivative of both sides of (92) and a little
algebraic manipulation, leads to Newton’s ﬁrst and second laws.)

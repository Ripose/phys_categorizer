the quantized space.

Abstract

It is shown, that the space quantum existence ( SQE ) non-ambiguously
determines the metrical form for the space without a time, using weak con-
dition of metrical additivity. The hypothesis is proposed, Riemann metric
is only possible for quantized space classes. This statement probably can
close the problem of metrical form.

During long time the space problem is discussed in many works from the point
of view of connection between space and time coordinates[1]. It is reckoned, the
metrical space form is proved by experimental data and this question was not
discussed. But now many virtual spaces exist ( see, for example [2] ) and there
is not guaranty, that space metrical form is unique.

The following approach probably closes the metrical form problem. Cer-
tainly, all spectrum of this problem is not discussed in this article , particularly
, in cases, when global constants can be changed, etc, but the proposed method
can be useful in future.

As known, Fermat’s theorem is formulated1 as the follow statement: For
2 and natural α ≥ 3, it is not possible the follow

any integer nonzero Nx, Ny, NL
equality:

Using Plank’s hypothesis [4]about space quantum3: The minimal value of

x + N α

y = N α
L

N α

space length exists:

L = N lP l

(2)

where N is natural, lP l is space quantum.
For the spaces having natural metrical degree the follow theorem can be

proved:

Theorem. If ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are correct, then the space metrical degree of

quantized space have value α ≤ 2:
1 See information about proof in [3] .
2 In the most part, it’s written”for natural number ”, but for “ nonzero integer number ”

theorem is correct too.

3 The space quantum is q = p
Planck’s constant, c is light beam speed.

kxiki

The proof is made by the substitution kxik = NxilP l to ( 3 ), then equation

( 3 ) reduces to ( 1 ).

For Lp Banach’s space the theorem is proved.
Unfortunately, this approach has one shortcut: the metrics is limited by the

form ( 3 ) only.

Let the vector L, which be decomposed as

L = xi + yj

and the metric be some function of kxk,kyk: M = F (kxk , kyk) .
In the begin, we make the assumption, which should be deﬁnitelty natural

for the physical space: the “coordinate spliting”.

Axiom. A coordinate system exists, where metric is additive:

F (kx + yk = F (kxk) + F (kyk)

or

F (kLk) = F (kxk) + F (kyk)

Assuming Tailor’s decomposition is possible for metric

F (kLk) = X
i

ai kLki = X aiN i

P l,

and using Borh’s statement about the equivalence of continuous and discrete

approaches and accounting ( 7 ), we can rewrite ( 6 ) as:

L = a2N 2

L = aiN i

x + aiN i

( the grouping is made for degrees of lP l , taking into account that kxk, kyk

are arbitrary ).

But 8 is possible only if i ≤ 2 ( see previous theorem ) or for ai = 0.
This means that:

M (kLk) = a kxk

+ b kxk

(9)

For our case b = 0 .
So we nearly proved
Hypothesis.. Any additive metric in quantized space is quadratic.
Remark 1
It is interesting, that a can be zero. One-dimensional space does not have
decomposition ( 4 ). However, for any a , b in this space and c=a+b expression
( 6 ) is valid too: ( 6 ) does not rigoursly demand the decomposion ( 4 ), ( 5 )
is enough.

Remark 2.
In the framework of Borh’s conception [5] we used ( 1 ), ( 2 ) and ( 8 ), that
is not quite consistent , if one follows formal mathematical logic ( N x, N y are
not generally arbitrary for discrete approach). This contradiction is escaped,
because the numbers N x, N y take ”almost” all values: almost for any great
value N L we can ﬁnd N x, N y which satisfy to ( 1 ). Their number is inﬁnite,
furthermore, they have the very dense spectrum of values, that is enough for
the space construction. In this case, ( 9 ) can be used.

Remark 3.
The proposition, that linear operator exists, was not used: we did not inro-
duce scalar multiplicity deﬁnition, only special system, where metrics is additive.
This indicates , our space needs not be Hilbert’s.

Conclusion.
For the quantized space it is enough to assume that the space system, having
the additive metric, exists. Then we can conclude, that our space is Hilbert’s.
So for the space coordinates the connection between SQE and the metric

form is proved.

For the space, which includes the time, the problem is known can be solved on
the basis, that space coordinates’ metric is quadratic [1] . This deﬁnitely means
that pseudoeuclidic metric for inertial coordinate systems and, consequently,
Riemann’s metric for non-inertial system[1] is only possible for quantized spaces
classes.

These theorems are also the additional indirect proof of SQE.
Author would like thank I.Koganov for the discussion.

On Relativistic Generalization of Gravitational

Anatoli Andrei Vankov

IPPE, Obninsk, Russia; Bethany College, KS; anatolivankov@hotmail.com

The problem of point particle in the 1/r gravitational ﬁeld was

studied in SR-based Mechanics. Equations of motion under assump-

tion of ﬁeld dependent proper mass were obtained in the relativis-

tic Lagrangean framework. The dependence of proper mass on ﬁeld

strength was derived from the equations of particle motion. The re-

sult was the elimination of 1/r divergence. It was shown that a pho-

ton in a gravitational ﬁeld may be described in terms of a refracting

massless medium. This makes the gravity phenomenon compatible

with SR. New results concerning gravitational properties of particle

and photon are discussed. The conclusion is made that the approach

of ﬁeld-dependent proper mass is perspective for further studies on

divergence-free gravitational ﬁeld development.

Key words: Relativity, gravity, particle, photon, speed of light,

proper mass variation.

Introduction

The central question of this work is the one of Special Relativity mechanics:

is a gravitational force compatible with SR? When investigating it, we do

not use arguments from a quantum ﬁeld theory, and do not question Gen-

eral Relativity. The objective of this work is to show how a gravitational

force can be included in SR Mechanics framework. Though we use the term

“ﬁeld”, it has a classical mechanics meaning of 1/r potential ﬁeld, or the

corresponding Minkowski force ﬁeld. Occasionally we refer to some com-

parable results of “conventional theories” as far as it concerns problems of

particle motion discussed in conventional SR Mechanics as well as in GR or

classical ﬁeld theories under assumption of proper mass constancy. A nov-

elty of our approach is that the proper mass varies under the force action,

and its dependence on ﬁeld strength is found from the equations of motion.

At some historical stage of GR development, there were numerous at-

tempts to incorporate the Newton’s formulation of the gravitational law

into SR as a starting point to a ﬁeld theory development. A Newtonian ﬁeld

propagates with inﬁnite velocity, and one could expect that this assumption

would be automatically corrected in the covariant formulation of the gravita-

tional law. Approaches were based on the concept of proper mass constancy

and the concept of a photon coupling to the gravitational ﬁeld: the latter

was thought a necessary condition for explaining the observed bending of

light (see [1] and elsewhere). Not surprisingly, the attempts failed, ﬁrst of

all, because the stress-energy tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld has a van-

ishing trace. Thus, SR Mechanics of a point particle under gravitational

force action has never been developed.

We revisited this problem in the SR framework and studied the role of the

2

proper mass in SR dynamics. The conclusion was made that the commonly

used concept of the proper mass constancy is neither required in theory

physical foundations nor it is justiﬁed by observations: so far, this is an

arbitrary assumption, subject to theoretical examination and experimental

veriﬁcation.

In our SR-based methodology of a variable proper mass, the world line is

curved, while the metric remains the Minkowskian one: diagonal elements

are functions of dynamical variables, oﬀ-diagonal terms identically equal

zero. The equations of particle motion were derived, solutions to which un-

der weak-ﬁeld conditions were found similar to those in conventional theories

(GR and its modiﬁcations). New results were predicted concerning gravita-

tional properties of a particle under strong-ﬁeld conditions. As for photon,

the conclusion was made that it can be treated in a relativistic model, in

which a ﬁeld acts on the photon as an optically active medium. In other

words, this is the gravitational refraction rather then force attraction that

causes the bending of light. Thus, the issue of SR incompatibility with the

gravity phenomenon took a new turn: the inclusion of gravitational forces

into SR was justiﬁed.

It is shown that the concept of variable proper mass leads to a La-

grangean conservation symmetry and an elimination of the 1/r divergence

through the mechanism of proper mass “exhaustion”. This is a new impor-

tant result, which needs to be further investigated. Our idea of singularity

elimination was presented earlier in ([2]), and here we study diﬀerent aspects

of it in more details.

2 Lagrangean Formulation of Relativistic Mechan-

ics of Point Particle in Gravitational Field

2.1 Variable proper mass concept

The following deﬁnitions and denotations are used.

In Minkowski space

of metric ηµν , any 4-vector xµ (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3) is characterized by a time
(temporal) component x0 and a space (spatial) part, that is the 3-vector xi

(i = 1, 2, 3) in 3-space. The inner scalar product is deﬁned x · x = ηµνxµxν =
i(xi)2. The position vector in the 4-coordinate Minkowski
xµxµ = (x0)2 −
space is xµ = (c0t, xi); the vector traces the trajectory of motion (the world

P

line), which is not a straight line if a ﬁeld is present. The corresponding

proper velocity vector, which is tangent unit one, is a generalization of 3-

velocity vi: uµ = dxµ/ds, where ds =

dsµdsµ = c0dτ is the arc length

interval of world line s, c0 is the speed of light in the absence of ﬁeld, and

p

dτ = γt is related to the so-called coordinate time interval t in the formula

vi = dxi/dt.

The 4-momentum vector is introduced as a generalization of the 3-

momentum: P µ = muµ = m(dxµ/ds) with the obvious connection to vi:

P µ = (mγ, mγvi/c0). From this, the 4-momentum magnitude equals the

proper mass

P µPµ = m.

p

An important stage in Relativistic Mechanics is the introduction of

Minkowski force K µ (so far not speciﬁed) acting on a test particle of the

proper mass m. In GR and conventional Relativistic Mechanics the proper

mass is assumed to be constant m = m0, so the dynamics equation has the

form

dP µ/ds = d(m0uµ)/ds = m0duµ/ds = K µ

(1)

4

We change the above assumption and consider the proper mass being ﬁeld-

dependent m = m(s) to allow for a non-zero tangent Minkowski force com-

ponent uµ(dm/ds)

K µ = dP µ/ds = uµ(dm/ds) + m(duµ/ds)

(2)

The question arises: how does one know whether the proper mass is

constant (as mostly assumed in current ﬁeld theories) or ﬁeld dependent (as

suggested in this work)? Our viewpoint is that the proper mass constancy

assumption is the issue of theory physical foundations and subject to exper-

imental falsiﬁcation. It should be noted that the proper mass variability is

not a new idea: it was discussed in classical books on relativity theory by

Synge [3] and Moller [4] and occasionally later on in connections with ﬁeld

theories but did not draw much attention among physics community. We are

going to conﬁrm that the introduction of the ﬁeld-dependent proper mass

in the relativistic Lagrangean framework leads to a consistent relativistic

mechanics.

2.2 A relativistic generalization of static gravitational force

Consider a test particle characterized by a ﬁeld-dependent proper mass m.

Let the particle be slowly moved at a constant speed along the radial direc-

tion in the 1/r static gravitational potential ﬁeld due to a spherical source

of a radius R and a mass M0 >> m0, where m0 is a particle proper mass

at inﬁnity. Such an imaginary experiment can be done by means of an

ideal transporting device provided with a recuperating battery. Work on

the particle of a variable proper mass is given by:

2
0d(rg/r),
F (r)dr = m(r)c

(r ≥ R)

(3)

5

where rg = GM0/c2

0 is a gravitational interaction radius. Since the gravita-

tional force is compensated by a reaction from the transporting device, the

particle must exchange energy with the battery in a process of mass-energy

transformation. So the change of potential energy is related to the proper

mass change:

dm(r) = −m(r)d(rg/r), r ≥ R

and the proper mass of the particle is a function of r:

m(r) = m0 exp(−rg/r), r ≥ R

In a weak ﬁeld approximation r ≥ R >> rg, we have a Newtonian limit,

and still can retain the proper mass variation:

m(r) ∼= m0(1 − rg/r),

As is seen from (5), the proper mass tends to exhaust as (rg/r) rises, while

a gravitational potential energy takes the form:

2
W (r) = −m0c

[1 − exp(−rg/r)]

and the force work is given by

2
0· exp(−rg/r)d(rg/r)
F (r)dr = dW (r) = m0c

The potential energy changes within the range −m0c2 ≤ W (r) ≤ 0. There-
fore, it is limited by the factor c2, and a divergence of gravitational energy

is naturally eliminated. The same will be shown true for a particle in free

fall.

It is interesting to note that in the time of GR development, Finnish

physicist G. Nordstroem [5] tried to develop an alternative gravitational

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

6

mechanics and ﬁeld theory. Obviously, he was aware of option (2), in which

the proper mass depends on a gravitational potential φ(r). In 1912-13 he

considered a formulae m(r) = m0 exp(−gφ) with some “adjusting factor” g.

Having troubles with gravitational properties of light and inertial mass, he

did not come to a consistent theory and abandoned work after Einstein’s

GR was published in 1915.

From (5) it follows that a predicte deviation from 1/r potential is notice-

able near a source of high mss density, and it is not realistic yet to observe the

eﬀect in laboratories. Nevertheless, challenging experiments are in progress.

In one of them, an alleged test of a supersymmetry theory prediction of the
1/r2 law violation is attempted with the use of a symmetric torsion pen-

dulum [6]. The authors look for a quite large correction [1 + α exp (−r/λ)]

in a direction, which is opposite to what we predict. Their assessment of

the eﬀect was obtained by conventional mechanics methods based on the

gravitational force concept, in fact, similar to that of mechanical force: the

kinetic energy gain (γ − 1)m0 is taken from an “inexhaustible” source. For

this reason, potential energy is subject to 1/r divergence. We are motivated

by the prediction of a new phenomenon, the proper mass exhaustion (5) un-

der strong ﬁeld conditions. The phenomenon leads to a natural elimination

of the divergence.

2.3 Relativistic Lagrangean formulation of the problem

For a particle of variable proper mass m(s), s = s(xµ), in a gravitational 1/r

potential ﬁeld, it is convenient to introduce a proper Lagrangian L(s) in order

to exploit the Minkowski force concept K µ = −∂W/∂xµ. (In fact, we cannot

formulate the Lagrangian in terms of coordinate time t since a relationship

7

of Minkowski and “ordinary” forces is not known prior to proper Lagrangian

study). A relativistic analog to the diﬀerence of kinetic and potential energy

in our case is (m0 − m) with muµuµ = P µuµ. Because of the identity
uµuµ = 1 and the source being stationary, the Lagrangian should not an
explicit function of uµ or s. The proper mass must monotonously decrease

as the particle approaches the source since a mass defect is associated with

a growing binding energy. Yet, the potential ﬁeld concept requires that

m → m0, W → 0 at inﬁnity.

In terms of the Noether’s theorem, the s-

translation symmetry, or the t-translation in (t, xi) coordinate system, is

a manifestation of relativistic total energy conservation of a particle in a

potential ﬁeld.

We are going to study the time translation symmetry in Euler-Lagrange

equations derived from the Hamilton’s action principle. A relationship be-

tween any type of symmetry of a dynamical system with a conservation

of corresponding quantity (Noether’s current) is elegantly follows from the

famous Noether’s theorem. Her method works in a spirit of Hamilton’s

reformulation of Lagrangean mechanics. A trivial example is a classical sys-

tem characterized by a set of generalized dynamical variables [q(t),

˙q(t)]

and a Lagrangian L[(q(t),

˙q(t)], a system evolution is determined by the

Euler-Lagrange equations

d
dt

[∂L/∂ ˙q] = ∂L/∂q

(9)

If the r.h.s.

of (9) is zero (the system has a q-symmetry), a quantity

∂L/∂ ˙q is conserved.

If the system additionally has the time symmetry,

then dL(q, ˙q)]/dt − [∂L/∂q) ˙q + (∂L/∂ ˙q)(∂ ˙q)/∂t))] = 0. From this, in com-

bination with (9), the conserved Noether’s current j = [ ˙q(∂L/∂ ˙q) − L] is

derived. It characterizes a sum of kinetic and potential energy, the Hamil-

8

tonian H = (T + W ).

Back to our problem: having the term T = P µuµ = m in the proper

Lagrangian, one gets the Noether’s conserved current j = m0 − m + W = 0

(a change of kinetic energy equals a change of potential energy, their sum

equals zero). It satisﬁes the requirement (m0 − m) → 0, W → 0 at inﬁnity

(W ≤ 0). With the inclusion of rest mass, the conserved current is total

energy, the Hamiltonian

H = m0 + T + W = m0

(10)

We shall return to this issue later in discussions of relativistic Euler-Lagrange

equations.

2.4 Equations of motion

As was explained, the stationary Lagrangian is given by

L(s) = −m(s) − W (s)

(11)

where s = s(xµ) is a world line (arc)length, and a ﬁeld is characterized by

potential energy W (s) (it is negative for an attractive force). The Euler-

Lagrange equations of motion follow from Hamilton’s principle of the ex-

tremal action S

δS = δ

L(s)ds =

(δL)ds +

Ld(δs) = δS1 + δS2 = 0

with a set of dynamical variables xµ (the s is not the one). Obviously, the

proper mass m(s) should not be considered an additional dynamical variable

in a sense of the ﬁfth degree of freedom. Thereafter, m(s), W (s), u(s), s,

and ds are subject to variation through independent variations of xµ. The

9

proper velocity uµ(s) as a function of dynamic variables xµ will appear in

the variational procedure, as well.

It should be noted that the relativistic Lagrangean problem for a free

particle motion was discussed in [7], [8] with W (s) = 0, the Lagrangian

L(s) = −m0 (in our denotations) and the action variation δS = m0δ

Because variations δxµ between the end points are independent for diﬀerent

With the Lagrangian (11) substituted into (15), we have Euler-Lagrange

equations of motion

uµuµ = 1, uµ(duµ/ds) = 0

needs to introduce Minkowski force K µ = −uµ (∂W /∂s) to get the desired

equation of motion in terms of 4-momentum rate and Minkowski force

There are, actually, two orthogonal (vector) equations in (19)

tan, m(duµ/ds) = K µ

(20)

where uµ(dm/ds) = K µ

m(duµ/ds) = K µ

tan = −uµ∂W /∂s is a tangential component, and
per = −W (duµ/ds) is due to a Minkowski force component

acting perpendicularly to the world line. The two equations are coupled in

a feedback manner through a varying proper mass. From the scalar product

P µuµ and (18), the following useful formulae are obtained:

K µuµ = dm/ds, K 0u0 = dm/ds + K iui

(i = 1, 2, 3)

(21)

which express an energy balance (a current in 4-space). The existence of two

orthogonal solutions is a consequence of proper mass variability under force

action. This is a new result, signiﬁcance of which is seen in applications.

3 The 1/r Gravitational Potential

3.1 Equations of motion

For the practical use of results obtained in previous sections, one should

express (19) in terms of time-dependent 3-space coordinates xi(t) using a

connection of proper/improper quantities ds = c0dt/γ and the deﬁnition of

P µ. The t is a “wristwatch” time measured by an observer at rest with

respect to the source but far away from it (ideally, at inﬁnity), as discussed

later.

The spatial part of (19) is given by

d

(γmvi) = F i

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

with the relationship between Minkowski and ordinary forces acting on a

test particle in 3-space

The second independent equation follows from the temporal part of (19):

F i =

which expresses the total energy rate of the particle in the ﬁeld. By deﬁ-

nition of a conservative ﬁeld, K0, being a total energy rate, must be zero,

hence, γm = C. For the particle starting free fall from rest at inﬁnity,

C = m0, γm = m0. This result will be later substantiated by considering

the Noether’s conservative current, which is recognized in (21) or, equiva-

lently

Further we are to restrain ourself to the problem of free radial fall; an

orbital motion is subject to a separate work. Thus, dr(t) = c0β(t)dt, and

2
2
0dm
0) = γF (r)dr + c
γd(γmc

(26)

which is the total energy balance in a diﬀerential form. In fact, this is the

Noether’s conservative current discussed earlier in terms of proper quantities

and now expressed in the (r, t) coordinates in the diﬀerential form. It man-

ifests a total energy conservation law for a particle in a spherical symmetric

potential ﬁeld: “the conserved total energy” equals a sum of “the potential

energy change due to gravitational force work” and the corresponding “ki-

netic energy change”, where the total energy is γm = m0 in the considered

case of free fall from rest at inﬁnity. Therefore, the l.h.s. of (26) is zero.

12

Next step is to substitute the gravitational force expression (3) into (22)

(or equivalently (26)) to ﬁnd the proper mass function m(r) taking into

account the conservation γm = m0. With a denotation γr = m0/m(r), the
equation for radial motion takes the form m0c2

0γβdβ = m0c2

0d(rg/r) with

the dynamical solution to it

1/γr = m(r)/m0 = 1 − rg/r, m(r) = m0(1 − rg/r)

(27)

where r = r(t), γr(t) = γ[r(t)] that is, γm = m0 with m[r(t)] as a function

of r in (27). It looks like a linear approximation (6) of the static relation

(5) and consequently has a range restriction (r ≥ R > rg), discussed later.

From this solution, kinetic energy as a diﬀerence of total and proper energy

is

2
2
2
0(rg/r)
0 = mc
0 − m(r)c
Ekin = m0c

(r ≥ R > rg)

(28)

while the sum of kinetic and potential energy equals zero what makes the
total energy Etot = m0c2

0. By ﬁnding the speciﬁc function m(r) (27), we

conﬁrmed the Noether’s current concept (10) and the constancy γm = m0.
If the particle in radial fall has kinetic energy at inﬁnity E0 = γ0m2
0

then, due to the total energy conservation, m0 should be replaced by γ0m0;

correspondingly, the equality γ(t) = γr(t) should be replaced by γ(t) =
0)−1/2, v0 is
γ0γr(t), where γr = m0/m(r), r = r(t) as before, γ0 = (1 − v2

0/c2

the radial speed at inﬁnity. Then (28) becomes

2
0(γ0 − 1) + rg/r
Ekin = mc

(29)

However, this is not a ﬁnal result because we need to take into account the

mass defect in the gravitational force expression (considered next).

13

3.2 Correction for the source mass defect, and ﬁnal results.

Our requirement of (rg < R) in (28) precludes the proper mass from reaching

a zero value in the exterior region when m → 0 at r → rg. The problem is
caused by the simpliﬁed concept of the gravitational radius rg = GM/c2

0, in

which a binding energy of the sphere (a mass defect) was ignored because

the interior solution for r < rg was not studied. We need to take into

account the fact that M 6= M0 =

i m0i, where mi0 are proper masses “at

inﬁnity” of particles comprising the sphere. The diﬀerence is a self-binding

P

energy ∆M = M0 − M . One needs to reformulate the problem in terms
of rg0 = GM0/c2

0 with the correction for the mass defect. An approximate

way to do it would be to introduce a spacial factor M0/M = m0/m = γr(r).

Then, the gravitational force takes the form

F (r)dr = GM0(m

2

2
2
0(m/m0)
/m0)dr(1/r) = m0c

d(rg0/r)

(30)

The correction ensures physical requirement (m(r) > 0) in the whole range

(r > R) and a boundary junction of exterior solution m(r) at (r ≥ R)

with that at the surface r = R without actual ﬁnding the interior solution.

Further on, we drop the lower zero index in rg0 and use the previous de-
notation rg = GM0/c2

0 for the gravitational radius having a new meaning.

The introduction of the additional factor γr = m0/m in the source term is

an approximate way to account for the source self-binding eﬀect in order to

correct a radial dependence of an exterior ﬁeld under strong ﬁeld conditions.

All things considered, the equation (22) takes the form

2

γ

βdβ = d(rg/r)

and the dynamical solution is:

1/γr = m/m0 = exp (−rg/r),

(r ≥ R)

14

(31)

(32)

It coincides with the static solution (5). Having kinetic energy term γ0 been

accounted for from the condition at inﬁnity, we have a ﬁnal set of formulae:

γ = γ0γr = γ0 exp(rg/r), β(r) =

1 − (1/γ2

(cid:2)

0 ) exp(−2rg/r)
(cid:3)

1/2

(33)

and squared norms of the 4-momentum P µ = m(γ, γβ, 0, 0) and the 4-

coordinate vector ∆xµ = c0∆τ (γ, γβ, 0, 0)

(c0m)

2

2

− p

2
(∆s)

2
= (c0γ∆τ )

2
− (∆r)

Relations will be used further: γ = γrγ0, γm = γ0m0, γ∆τ = γ0∆t0,

p = c0γβm = c0γ0βm0, ∆s = c0∆τ , ∆r = c0γβ∆τ = c0γ0β∆t0 (t0 is the

“coordinate” time measured by the rest observer at inﬁnity; it is usually

denoted t, as discussed later).

Formulae for total, kinetic, and potential energy are:

2
+ (mc0)

0 = m0c
Ekin(r) = Etot − mc

2
0 [1 − exp (−rg/r)] ,
W (r) = −m0c

(r ≥ R)

It is seen that −m0c2

0 ≤ W ≤ 0. When m0 << M0, the kinetic energy

emerges solely due to the change of the proper mass of a test particle in a

ﬁeld, and the proper mass “exhaustion” under strong ﬁeld conditions takes

place. We want to emphasize again that the divergence is eliminated for an

arbitrary mass density of the source and a however strong ﬁeld.

Under weak-ﬁeld conditions rg/r << 1, we have

γ = γ0(1 + rg/r), β = [1 − (1 − rg/r)/γ0)]

(40)

(41)

and the Newtonian limit Ekin = mv2/2.

Clearly, our results and conventional ones diﬀer due to the diﬀerence

in concepts of relativistic mass and, correspondingly, potential energy. A

particle to be accelerated by a force at distance needs to be bound. The

binding energy in our philosophy is a real mass defect (m − m0) limited by

the proper mass value.

It makes the force weaken as r → rg so that no

inﬁnities arise. In the concept of proper mass constancy, the particle gets
bound while acquiring kinetic energy from ﬁeld energy m0c2

0(rg/r), so both

the binding and kinetic energy, in principle, are unlimited.

4 Lagrangian symmetry, Noether’s theorem, and

energy conservation

4.1 Time-translation symmetry, and energy conservation

In order to study the Noether’s current in more details, let us go back to

(34), (35) to consider a world line in the 4-momentum space in a manner as

we do in the 4-coordinate space, and compare 4-vector norms: ∆S(r) = |∆x|

and ∆Sp(r) = |∆P| of the coordinate vector ∆xµ = c0∆t(1, β, 0, 0) and
the momentum one c0P µ = c0m0(1, β, 0, 0), respectively. In the case of a

radial motion from rest at inﬁnity, the Lorentzian norms are:

∆S(r) =

i

= c0∆t0/γr = c0∆τ (r)

(42)

= c0m0/γr = m(r)

(43)

16

where r = r(t), c0β(r) = ∆r/∆t = ∆r′/∆τ (r). The operational meaning

is, as next. ∆r = c0β∆t0 is measured by a “far-away observer” at rest with

respect to the source. She determines β from measured ∆r per a constant

time interval ∆t0 by the time-of-ﬂight technique with the use of standard

clocks and rods. Thus, we term t = t0 with zero subscript “a far-away time”,

also called “a coordinate time”. Next quantities are the contracted radial
interval ∆r′ = ∆r/γ, and the world line interval ∆s(r) = c0∆τ (r) both

measured by a comoving observer. The contraction is a pure SR kinematical

eﬀect. It is seen that ∆s(r) = c0∆τ (r) is not invariant. Notice that β =
∆r/∆t0 = ∆r′/∆τ .

From measurements of the speed β, the gravitational time dilation eﬀect

can be obtained. The latter is associated with the proper mass dependence

on the gravitational potential m(r) = m0 exp(−rg/r). The corresponding

frequency of atomic clock of the proper mass m(r) is proportional to the
proper mass: m(r)c2

0 = hf (r), where f (r) = 1/T (r) is a relationship of f (r)

with the proper period T (r) = γr∆t0 recorded by a local standard clock at

rest at point r. Hence, T (r) = ∆t0 at inﬁnity. The clock put at a deeper

potential level r2 → r1, r2 > r1 will slow down by the factor γr in agreement
with observations. Therefore, one needs the factor γr = (1 − β2)1/2 =

exp (rg/r) from measured values of β for γ0 = 1 to ﬁnd m(r) = m0/γr,
f (r) = f0/γr. There is a useful relationship ∆τ (r)T (r) = ∆t2

0. It becomes

clear that the assumption of the proper mass constancy in the SR-based

mechanics would result in a failure of a gravitational time dilation prediction.

This is one of the reasons to discard the assumption of proper mass constancy

in the SR framework. Changing the assumption makes a desired diﬀerence.

One can recognize a new conservation symmetry by examining 4-vector

components in (42), (43) and rearranged in (44); γ0 is put equal to unit for

17

simplicity there. Given conditions at inﬁnity, conserved quantities are seen

on the l.h.s. of each equation in (44):

2
[c0∆t0]

2
= [∆S(r)]

2
+ [∆r]

,

2
(c0m0)

2
= [∆Sp(r)]

2
+ [p(r)]

(44)

Instead of hyperbolic rotation in metric (+, -, -, -), a real rotation symmetry

emerged in the 4-vector representation in a quasi-Euclidean geometry of

signature (+, +, +, +). The constant radius of rotation is c0∆t0 and c0m0

in coordinate and momentum space, correspondingly. The rotation angle

θ is determined by sin θ = β[r(t)], or identically cos θ = 1/γ = γ[r(t)].

Compare it with an imaginary angle ψ of hyperbolic rotation: cosh ψ = γ,

sinh ψ = γβ, tan ψ = β. Hence, sin θ = tanh ψ = β.

4.2 Total energy conservation law and dynamical comple-

mentarity principle

The new (real rotation) symmetry ensures the total energy conservation law

in the approach of the variable proper mass concept. It can be shown that

a similar symmetry takes place under general conditions at inﬁnity when

(γ0 > 0) or (γ0 < 0); the case of a negative initial kinetic energy at inﬁnity

means that the test particle is dropped at some ﬁnite point r > R where

the potential is not zero. The energy conservation is interpreted in terms

of Nether’s conserved mass-energy current in the momentum space. Our

ﬁnding is that there is a similar conserved current in the coordinate space.

It corresponds to the constant time rate recorded by a far-away atomic clock.

Therefore, there are equivalent symmetries in P µ and xµ spaces. This fact is

known and used in the SR Kinematics, when the Klein-Gordon equation is

derived in the SR Kinematics framework with the relativistic generalization

of the de Broglie wave concept. The latter includes such quantities as the

18

4-phase φ = (ωt − k · r), the 4-wave vector (E/c0, p) = ¯h/c0(ω, k), where
E = mc2

0 = ¯hω = hf ; consequently, P µ ∼ f µ ∼ K µ in SR Kinematics. The

following scalar product is Lorentz invariant:

K µ∆xµ = c0P µ∆xµ = h or c0P µxµ = N h

(45)

where N is a number of wavelength (clock ticks). It is not surprising that

the generalized de Broglie concept is valid in our gravitational dynamical

problem in the quasi-Euclidean representation (44), the invariance of the

scalar product (45) in the quasi-Euclidean metric takes place as well. The

operational meaning of it is clear: all observers agree to use standard atomic

clocks of the proper mass m0 at inﬁnity. The clock is considered a quan-

tum oscillator in the de Broglie wave concept (∆t0 and m0 are reciprocal

quantities) in the ﬁeld-dependent proper mass approach.

The fact of invariance (44) in the quasi-Euclidean dynamical metric is

called further ”the dynamical complementarity principle” due to its signiﬁ-

cance in our study. The quantum de Broglie concept is seen to be naturally

embedded in our SR-based gravitational dynamics before a ﬁeld theory de-

velopment. Some other issues relevant to the problem are discussed in [9].

We believe that the real rotation symmetry is a true gravitational mechanics

law to be conﬁrmed by observations; it reﬂects the idea of mass and time

unity and enables us to gain into a new insight of physical and philosophical

concepts of matter and time.

4.3 Graphical illustrations, and lessons

A brief comment is needed before discussing graphical illustrations of the free

fall problem. In SR textbooks, the Lorentz kinematical transformation is

usually illustrated by a straightforward picture of hyperbolic rotation. This

19

would be a trigonometrical rotation in a complex plane by an imaginary

angle ψ, tan ψ = ıβ; optionally, it can be shown as a hyperbolic rotation in

a real plane so that tanh φ = β, hence, tan ψ = tanh φ. The idea in both

variants is to show in the graph the invariant Lorentz norm ∆s as a rotating

radius.

Our graphic presentation is diﬀerent and has more physical sense for us.

There are three terms depicted in each graph in a real plane: “spatial part”

versus “Lorentzian norm”. The picture presents the Lorentzian quadratic

metric: “squared Lorentzian norm” = “squared temporal part” - “squared

spatial part”, and at the same time the quasi-Euclidean one: “squared tem-

poral part” = “squared Lorentzian norm”+ “squared spatial part”. In the

second case, a “temporal part” (not the Lorentzian norm) rotates in a real
plane by a real angle θ = tan−1(γβ).

It is possible now to illustrate the

norm invariance in usual Lorentz-boost transformations (the case of inertial

motion) as well as a real rotation in the case of free radial fall. In Fig.1 each

graph is presented equivalently in (p, m) and (r, τ ) planes of P µ and xµ

Minkowski spaces, correspondingly.

Let us start with the case of the pure (no ﬁeld) Minkowski space. There

are three graphs a), b), and c), which are diﬀerent in a type of constraints

imposed on Lorentz kinematical transformations in the 4-coordinate and

4-momentum spaces.

Graph c) presents a family of world lines with the parameter β in pure

(no ﬁeld) Minkowski space. This is the case when observers travel with dif-

ferent speed provided the travel proper time ∆τ0 measured by the traveling

observer is ﬁxed. “The staying at home” and traveling observers agreed to

use standard atomic clocks to verify ∆τ constancy. Consequently, both the

proper time and the proper mass in the family of world lines are Lorentz

situations, as seen next.

invariant. Lorentz invariance does not takes place in other than case c)

Graphs b) describes the problem of travel with a speed β (as a parameter)

from O to A of a ﬁxed distance, a constraint, OA = ∆r = ∆r0 = c0β∆t in a

pure Minkowski space. Graph a) is the case of the constraint ∆t = ∆t0 (the

travel time ∆t = ∆t0 is ﬁxed in the far-away observer’s coordinate system).

In both cases, it is not possible to make an agreement to use standard clocks:

both the proper time and the proper mass depend on β (they are not Lorentz

invariant, and the kinematical complementarity does not hold).

Now, let us discuss our SR-based dynamical problem of free radial fall

21

in the graph a), m(r) = m0/γr, r = r(t). The graph illustrates the quasi-

Euclidean representation of Minkowski 4-vectors. The family is produced in

a single experiment with one freely falling particle, the world line of which

is divided into small adjacent intervals (partitions), the Lorentzian norm

∆s = c0∆τ . Conditions at inﬁnity are ﬁxed: θ = 0, ∆τ = ∆t = ∆t0;

(γ0 = 1 for simplicity). The dynamical complementarity principle and the

time translation symmetry hold. The Lorentzian norm and the proper mass

are functions of β, while the vector OP is a conserved temporal component.

The graph shows a real rotation of OP with a constant radius of rotation

(the Noether’s current) OP = c0γβ∆τ = c0β∆t0 in xµ space and OP =

γm = m0 in P µ space. The angle θ(β) is a function of dynamic variables

xµ. It characterizes an instantaneous state of a freely falling particle at an
instant t: θ(r) = sin−1 β(r), r = r(t). Obviously, graphs b) and c) are not

relevant to the problem.

Some lessons are drawn from graphs.

1. There are two categories of constant physical quantities. The ﬁrst

category relates to the hyperbolic rotation in pure Minkowski space. The

constancy is due to constraints imposed on the Lorentzian vector representa-

tion. Only the constraint c) leads to the kinematical complementarity prin-

ciple and Lorentz invariance under β-boost transformations in 4-coordinate

and 4-momentum complementary spaces. The Lorentz invariance is due to

the translation symmetry of a 4-point in Minkowski xµ and P µ space at the

same time. An attempt to construct an “extended” Lorentz group with-

out respecting the complementarity principle would mean the abuse of the

Minkowski space concept.

2. One should distinguish the ﬁrst (kinematical) category of Lorentz

invariant quantities from the second (dynamical) category of conserved (un-

22

changed in time) quantities in a Lagrangian system, the Noether’s theorem

deal with (as in case a). Our object under investigation is a 4-vector under-

going an evolution in the Lagrangian dynamical system in the Minkowski

space. One can think of ∆s as an “instantaneous image” of the proper

4-position vector OP tracing a small linear interval s → (s + ∆s) on the

curved world-line s in the 4-coordinate space or m → (m + ∆m) in the

4-momentum space. In the picture a), the interval is a P -projection on the

τ -axis, (or on the m-axis) and it is not constant: it gets smaller as the par-

ticle approaches the source. However, the interval ∆t = OP is preserved.

To ﬁnd the proportion ∆t0/∆τ (r) = T (r)/∆t0 and the time interval T (r)

referred to the gravitational time dilation, one needs to draw the tangent

line at the point P to the intersection with the horizontal axis.

3. The picture a) illustrates SR-based gravitational dynamics, essential

part of which is the ﬁeld-dependent proper mass concept. The conservation

takes the form of rotation symmetry in a real plane in a quasi-Euclidean

4-space, and it is associated with the Noether’s conserved current due to

the time translation symmetry, as in classical mechanics.

Descriptions of free fall in space-time and in the 4-momentum space are

formally identical. Indeed, the ﬁnal equation of motion (31) does not con-

tain a mass of a test particle (as in classical mechanics). The parameter of

physical importance is the gravitational interaction radius rg in the gauge

factor γr = rg/r: the factor determines Minkowski space deformation via

space-time and mass-energy rescaling. On the one hand, the source causes

proper mass variation under Minkowski force action (the momentum space

curvature). On the other hand, it makes the world line curved (the coor-

dinate space curvature). Certainly, the two currents would follow from the

Noether’e theorem, provided the complementarity principle was stated in

23

the Lagrangean problem formulation.

4. “Two currents” means that in our originally formulated relativistic

Lagrangian, the proper mass m can be replaced by the complementary quan-

tity ∆τ to allow the Minkowski force coming to the scene in the momentum

K µ

m representation (aﬀecting the proper mass), or coordinate K µ

τ represen-

tation (aﬀecting the proper time) with the equivalent outcome. To agree on

this proposition, one has to think about acted by force particles in a broader

concept of atomic clocks, or interacting quantum oscillators, probing both

mass/energy and space/time local (generally evolving) metric in compari-

son with the constant background at inﬁnity (this is simply a suggestion to

consider the de Broglie wave propagation in a gravitational ﬁeld). Conse-

quently, we deal with a complementary (double) Lagrangean formulation of

the problem. As a result, there are two complementary solutions:

m = m0 exp (−rg/r), ∆τ = ∆t0 exp (−rg/r)

(46)

obtained in Sections 2 and 3 without emphasizing the fact of a double for-

mulation. To check if it is true, just put m = m0/γ and uµ = (γ, γβ, 0, 0)

for Km in (19), and do the same with ∆τ = ∆τ0/γ for Kτ .

In the next Section, we discuss the photon problem in the Minkowski

(deformed) space. Instead of GR “curved space-time ﬁeld”, the more ap-

propriate in SR Mechanics term is used: “gravitational refracting medium”.

5 A photon in the gravitational ﬁeld

Unlike the particle, the photon does not have a proper mass; its total mass

is solely a kinetic one. One has to look for conserved quantities in the

photon metric taking into account the photon SR kinematics [10]. Instead

24

of detailed analysis, we simplify the problem by considering the photon

emitter/detector at rest with the respect to the source and making use of

the fact that any photon in ﬂight in a gravitational ﬁeld is characterized

by the two conserved quantities: an energy (frequency) and an angular

momentum (the latter is out of consideration here).

Thus, we assert that the energy (frequency) of the photon emitted at any

point does not change during its travel in a gravitational ﬁeld. From the

concept of the atomic clock, it follows that the frequency fph at the instant

of emission must be proportional to the frequency of an atomic clock-emitter
f (r) = m(r)c2

0/h = f0 exp(−rg/r), that is, the emission frequency is ﬁeld

dependent. Therefore, the momentum (or the wavelength) and the speed

of light will proportionally change with respect to those values measured

by the far-away observer in experiments with the standard photon from her

clock-emitter. All said above is suﬃcient for the determination of photon

gravitational properties in the model, in which Minkowski space ﬁlled with

ﬁeld is considered a transparent refracting medium.

The next set of formulae describe characteristics of the photon detected

at a point r, if emitted at a point r′.

fph(r

→ r) = f0 exp(−rg/r

)

′

(47)

where f0 is the photon frequency at inﬁnity; the photon does not change the

initial (emission) frequency during its ﬂight. The photon speed (the speed

of light) is

cph(r

→ r) = c0 exp(−rg/r)

(48)

So far, we consider results valid for all frequencies (there is no dispersion);

hence, a photon and light propagate similarly. The speed of light at detection

25

point r does not depend on a point of emission r′. Consequently, the photon

λph(r

→ r) = λ0 exp(rg/r

− rg/r)

′

(49)

It follows that the photon wavelength at any point of emission equals the

wavelength at inﬁnity λ0. Finally, the proper period of a resonance line of

wavelength is

atomic clock is

′

Tres(r

) = 1/fres(r

)

′

′

(50)

All quantities with “zero” subscript are measured at inﬁnity. The speed of

light is inﬂuenced by the gravitational potential according to (48); further

a dimensionless form is used

βph(r) = c(r)/c0 = exp(−rg/r)

(51)

This is the speed of light wave propagation. Physical processes described by

the above formulae are time reversal in accordance with the energy conser-

vation. Thus, the gravitational time dilation and the red shift are due to the

ﬁeld dependence of the emission frequency and the speed of light, provided

the photon energy being conserved.

It is seen that the speed of light is constant on the equipotential surface

r = r0, and it may be termed a tangential, or arc speed. One can deﬁne
also the radial (“coordinate”) speed ˜βph(r)

˜βph(r) = βph(r)(dr/dλ) = exp(−2rg/r)

(52)

Under weak-ﬁeld conditions, it coincides with the corresponding GR for-

mula.

We conclude that the photon propagates in a gravitational ﬁeld as in
a refracting medium with the index of gravitational refraction ng = 1/ ˜βph.

26

The refraction concept was discussed in the GR literature (see, for example

[4], [11], [12]). It should be noted that there is no evidence that a static

electric or magnetic ﬁeld alone would aﬀect the speed of the photon.

6 Predictions and Observations

GR tests are related to weak-ﬁeld conditions and usually presented in liter-

ature as a solid GR gravitodynamics conﬁrmation of the curved space-time

concept [13, 14]. In fact, under those conditions of “near-Newton” limit, a

behavior of a photon and atomic clock in our approach is similar to that in

GR (in spite of diﬀerent space-time philosophy). How well our approach ﬁts

all observations is a special issue; many details need to be further investi-

gated. Here we are able to make only a brief review of basic facts.

1. The gravitational red-shift and time dilation

The term “red-shift” means that the wavelength of a photon emitted by

an atomic clock at some point of lower potential appears to be increased

when detected at some point of higher potential. Our interpretation of the

red-shift was explained earlier: the eﬀect is due to a combination of the

gravitational shift of the emission-detection resonance line and the depen-

dence of the speed of light on ﬁeld strength while a frequency of a photon

in ﬂight being constant and equal to the emission frequency (47-50). The

latter is proportional to the ﬁeld dependent proper mass f ∼ m what causes

the gravitational time dilation. This interpretation is consistent with to-

tal energy and angular momentum conservation laws in the ﬁeld-dependent

proper mass concept.

2. The bending of light

27

The bending of light is due to the “gravitational refraction”. We con-

ducted diﬀerent calculations of the bending eﬀect: using a refraction model,

and using the angular momentum conservation; in both cases, the result was

the same and similar to that in GR.

3. The time delay of light ﬂight

The time delay eﬀect was measured in radar echo experiments with elec-

tromagnetic pulses passing near the Sun. The eﬀect can be calculated by

integrating the time of light travel over the path with the ﬁeld-dependent

coordinate speed (52); the result will be equivalent to GR predictions.

4. Planetary perihelion precession and other astronomical observations

This problem is related to a particle orbital motion in a gravitational

ﬁeld. It adds nothing new to our conclusion about absence of numerical dif-

ference in predictions of weak-ﬁeld eﬀects in the alternative versus conven-

tional theory. The perihelion precession can be assessed in GR by comparing

radial and orbital frequencies in the Schwarzschild metric under weak-ﬁeld

approximation or in the post-Newtonian parameterization model.

In the

alternative approach, the corresponding physical treatment is equivalent to

that in the eﬀective potential model, in which dynamical quantities of or-

bital motion are inﬂuenced by the ﬁrst-order ﬁeld dependence of the proper

mass in the Minkowski space.

5. A particle in free fall in a gravitational ﬁeld

This is the case when we can compare predictions under high energy

conditions. According to GR [1], a relative speed of a particle in a radial fall
0 ]1/2. It shows that from
is described by β(r) = (1 − 2rg/r)[1 − (1 − 2rg/r)/γ2

the viewpoint of the observer at inﬁnity a particle dropped from rest begins

to accelerate, then at some point starts decelerating and eventually stops

28

at r = 2rg. The bigger initial kinetic energy, the greater a ”resisting” force

arising so that the speed of the particle cannot exceed the coordinate speed

of light. Strangely enough, if γ0 ≥

3/2, the particle will never accelerate

in a gravitational ﬁeld, (see ([15, 16], and elsewhere).

p

The GR formula should be compared with our result (39): β(r) =

1 − (1/γ2

(cid:2)

0 ) exp(−2rg/r)
(cid:3)

1/2

, which does not indicate any “resisting force”.

6. “Black holes” and other “strong ﬁeld” observations

There are astrophysical observations related to strong-ﬁeld eﬀects (the

so-called black holes, radiating binary star systems, and others). Of course,

there should be strong-ﬁeld eﬀects around astrophysical objects of super-

high density. Practically, they might look like circumstantial evidence of

“black holes” manifesting “gravitational collapse” and the corresponding

“light trap”. However, the idea of matter collapse into a singularity point

in space seems to be an unnecessary “new physics” speculation.

In our

alternative approach, the gravitational time dilation could be however great;

physical processes involving particle and photon motion in a strong ﬁeld

remain time-reversal and free of singularities. We predict an existence of

extremely dense ordinary material formations of a strong gravitational pull

without collapsing.

7 Summary and Conclusion

- The problem of relativistic motion in a gravitational ﬁeld was studied in the

Special Relativity dynamics of point particle. The novelty of our approach to

the problem is an introduction of the ﬁeld dependent proper mass concept,

as opposed to conventional assumption of the proper mass constancy. His-

torically, the SR-based gravitational dynamics has never been developed. It

29

was believed that the gravity phenomenon and Special Relativity are incom-

patible. Gravitational properties of relativistic particles are also not easy to

explain. General Relativity did explain the observed gravitational proper-

ties of particles and photons. As for to-day, GR has been thoroughly tested

under weak-ﬁeld conditions; however, strong-ﬁeld eﬀects still have not been

veriﬁed in direct measurements. The long-standing, not thoroughly under-

stood problem is the GR non-quantizibility. Another problem is associated

with the strong-ﬁeld 1/r divergence, which cannot be removed by a means

of renormalization procedure. That is why alternative approaches to the

gravitational problem are often speculated in literature.

- We studied conservation properties of the 1/r gravitational potential in

the relativistic Lagrange framework in the context of Noether’s currents as-

sociated with the time and mass translation symmetry. A quantum connec-

tion of the theory via the generalized de Broglie wave concept was established

and the complementarity principle in relativistic dynamics was formulated.

The proper mass and time are scalars, which determine the temporal part

of coordinate and momentum (complementary) 4-vectors characterizing the

particle as a standard quantum oscillator, or a standard atomic clock. The

complementarity principle requires that all observers use standard atomic

clocks in the metric determination comparing to the time pace at inﬁnity.

The principle enables us to gain an insight into a unity of mass and time

concepts and quantum connections of relativistic gravitational dynamics due

to the relationship m0c02∆τ0 = h.

- One of our ﬁndings is that a photon propagation may be described in

terms of refraction in a gravitational ﬁeld medium. This is not an unusual

approach to the photon problem: a similar photon concept was from time

to time considered in the GR framework. It means that the photon may

30

not be energetically coupled to the gravitational ﬁeld but be inﬂuenced by

another (refraction) mechanism of gravitational interaction. We concluded

that the inclusion of the photon refraction concept along with a revised

proper mass concept into SR-based mechanics makes predictions consistent

with existing gravitational (weak-ﬁeld) observations. New predictions in

strong ﬁeld domain were made.

- The photon does not have the proper mass. Consequently, it gives

rise to the null Lorentzian metric. In SR methodology, the photon plays an

important role in determination of both temporal and spatial parts of com-

plementary 4-vectors by a means of information (photon) exchange between

observers. One of our ﬁndings is that the relativistic Lagrangean problem

has a dual formulation in terms of complementary quantities. This makes

the concept of a gravitational ﬁeld as a refracting medium more understand-

able but still does not give a clue about the mechanism of changing the speed

of light (permittivity and permeability of space) in the ﬁeld. The question

of “refracting” properties of a gravitational ﬁeld must be challenging for

quantum gravity researchers.

- The motivation of this work is new results in a strong ﬁeld domain, in

particularly, the 1/r divergence elimination through a natural mechanism

of mass defect rising with ﬁeld strength (the predicted “mass exhaustion”

eﬀect). We believe that the approach developed in the SR-based frame-

work will be perspective for further studies on developing a divergence-free

gravitational ﬁeld theory.

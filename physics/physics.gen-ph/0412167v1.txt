In this paper we present an axiomatic, geometric, formulation of electromagnetism with only one axiom: the ﬁeld
equation for the Faraday bivector ﬁeld F . This formulation with F ﬁeld is a self-contained, complete and consistent
formulation that dispenses with either electric and magnetic ﬁelds or the electromagnetic potentials. All physical
quantities are deﬁned without reference frames, i.e., they are geometric four dimensional (4D) quantities or, when
some basis is introduced, every quantity is represented as a 4D coordinate-based geometric quantity comprising both
components and a basis. The observer independent, expressions for the stress-energy vector T (n) (1-vector), the
energy density U (scalar), the Poynting vector S and the momentum density g (1-vectors), the angular momentum
density M (bivector) and the Lorentz force K (1-vector) are directly derived from the ﬁeld equation for F . The
local conservation laws are also directly derived from the ﬁeld equation. We also brieﬂy consider the corresponding
Lagrangian formulation that exclusively deals with F . It is shown that this geometric formulation is in a full agreement
with the Trouton-Noble experiment.

Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed
to fade away into mere shadows and only a kind of union of
the two will preserve an independent reality. H. Minkowski

I. INTRODUCTION

In the usual Cliﬀord (geometric) algebra treatments of the classical electromagnetism, e.g., with multivectors [1-3]
(for a more mathematical treatment of the Cliﬀord algebra see also [4]), one starts with a single ﬁeld equation using
the Faraday bivector ﬁeld F and the gradient operator ∂ (1-vector), see eq. (8) below. In order to get the more
familiar form the bivector ﬁeld F is expressed (in [1,2]) in terms of the sum of a relative vector EH (corresponds to
the three-dimensional (3D) electric ﬁeld vector E) and a relative bivector γ5BH (BH corresponds to the 3D magnetic
ﬁeld vector B, and γ5 is the (grade-4) pseudoscalar for the standard basis {γµ}) by making a space-time split in the
γ0 - frame, which depends on the observer velocity cγ0; the subscript H is for “Hestenes.” Both EH and BH are, in
fact, bivectors. Then the following relations (from [1-2])

F = EH + cγ5BH , EH = (F · γ0)γ0, γ5BH = (1/c)(F ∧ γ0)γ0

are understood as that they deﬁne F in terms of the sum of EH and γ5BH and the components of F are considered
to be determined by EH and BH , i.e., by the components of the 3D E and B. Similarly in [3] F is decomposed in
terms of 1-vector EJ and a bivector BJ ; the subscript J is for “Jancewicz,”

F = γ0 ∧ EJ − cBJ , EJ = F · γ0, BJ = −(1/c)(F ∧ γ0)γ0.

It is supposed in [1-3] that the right hand sides (EH , BH and EJ , BJ ) of the ﬁrst equations in (1) and (2) determine
the left hand sides (F ). We remark that it is generally accepted in the geometric algebra formalism (and in the
tensor formalism as well) that the usual Maxwell equations (ME) with the 3D vectors E and B and the ﬁeld equation
written in terms of F , eq. (8) below, are completely equivalent. Further both in the tensor formalism, e.g., [5], and
in the geometric algebra formalism it is assumed that the components of the 3D E and B deﬁne in a unique way the
components of F according to the relations

Ei = F i0, Bi = (−1/2c)εiklFkl.

In (3) the components of the 3D ﬁelds E and B are written with lowered (generic) subscripts, since they are not
the spatial components of the 4D quantities. This refers to the third-rank antisymmetric ε tensor too. The super-
and subscripts are used only on the components of the 4D quantities. Greek indices run from 0 to 3, while latin

indices i, j, k, l, ... run from 1 to 3, and they both designate the components of some geometric object in some
system of coordinates. (It is worth noting that Einstein’s fundamental work [6] is the earliest reference on covariant
electrodynamics and on the identiﬁcation of components of F αβ with the components of the 3D E and B.) All this
means that the 3D E and B and not the F ﬁeld are considered as primary quantities for the whole electromagnetism.
Even in the very recent geometric approaches to classical electrodynamics [7-9] the 3D E and B are considered as
primary quantities. Thus it is stated in [7]: “The electromagnetic ﬁeld strength Fij = (E, B) (in [7] i, j, k, ... =
0, 1, 2, 3, my remark) is composed of the electric and magnetic 3-vector ﬁelds.” In order to get the wave theory of
electromagnetism the vector potential A (1-vector) is usually introduced and F is deﬁned in terms of A as F = ∂ ∧ A.
In that case the F ﬁeld appears as the derived quantity from the potentials. Thence in all usual treatments of the
electromagnetism, both in the tensor formalism and in the geometric algebra formalism, the theory is presented as
that the F ﬁeld does not have an independent existence but is deﬁned either by the components of the 3D E and B
or by the components of the electromagnetic potential A.

In this paper we present an axiomatic formulation of the classical electromagnetism that uses the bivector ﬁeld F
(an observer independent 4D quantity) and in which only the ﬁeld equation with F (eq. (8) below) is postulated. The
presented formulation with the F ﬁeld is a self-contained, complete and consistent formulation that does not make
use either electric and magnetic ﬁelds or the electromagnetic potential A (thus dispensing with the need for the gauge
conditions). In such formulation the F ﬁeld is the primary quantity for the whole classical electromagnetism both in
the theory and in experiments; F is a well-deﬁned 4D measurable quantity. In the ﬁeld view of particle-to-particle
interaction the electrodynamic interaction between charges is described as two-steps process; ﬁrst ﬁelds are seen as
being generated from their particle sources and then the ﬁelds so generated are perceived as interacting with some target
particle. The description of the ﬁrst step in the F formulation of electrodynamics is given in Secs. IV. A. and IV. B.
after we have presented a short review of the geometric algebra in Sec. II. and a short review of the invariant special
relativity (SR) in Sec. III..The invariant SR is developed in [10-15] and the F formulation is a part of that theory.
In Sec. IV. B. the general solution for F is applied to the determination of the electromagnetic ﬁeld F of a point
charge and that F is compared with the corresponding expressions given in terms of geometric 4D quantities that
represent electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In Sec. IV. C. the integral form of the ﬁeld equation for F is constructed which
is equivalent to the local ﬁeld equation (8). The second step of the description of the interaction process requires the
determination of the Lorentz force in terms of F and its use in Newton’s second law. This is at the same time the way
in which the components of F are measured in the chosen reference frame. It is described in Sec. IV. D. We also give
the expressions for the observer independent stress-energy vector T (n) (1-vector), the energy density U (scalar, i.e.,
grade-0 multivector), the Poynting vector S (1-vector), the angular momentum density M (bivector) and the Lorentz
force K (1-vector). They are all directly derived from the postulated ﬁeld equation with F (eq. (8)) and presented in
Sec. IV. E. The local charge-current density and local energy-momentum conservation laws are also directly derived
from that ﬁeld equation with F and there is no need to introduce the Lagrangian and the Noether theorem. These
laws are presented in Sec. IV. F. (Of course the integral conservation laws can be similarly derived but it will not be
done here.) In contrast to our theory with one postulated equation (eq. (8)) the recent theory [8] (also a geometric
approach) deals with three postulated equations. It will be shown here that all three axioms from [8] simply follow
from our axiom (8). Furthermore, as we already said, it is considered in [7,8], as in all other treatments, that F is
determined by the 3D E and B; see also [9] for the axiomatic formulation similar to [8]. As it is said the exposed
formulation with the ﬁeld equation for F does not need the Lagrangian. However in Sec. V. a brief exposition of the
Lagrangian formulation with the F ﬁeld is presented; the interaction term is also written in terms of F and not, as
usual, in terms of A. In Sec. VI. we give the comparison with the experiments, particularly with the Trouton-Noble
experiment. It is shown that the approach with geometric 4D quantities is in a full agreement with the Trouton-Noble
experiment. The explanation for the null result is very simple and natural. Namely in our approach all quantities
are invariant 4D quantities, which means that their values are the same in the rest frame of the capacitor and in the
moving frame. We have calculated that the torque (as a geometric 4D quantity) is zero for the stationary capacitor.
Then automatically it follows that the torque is zero for the moving capacitor as well. In the last section, Sec. VII.,
the discussion and conclussions are presented.

II. SHORT REVIEW OF GEOMETRIC ALGEBRA

First we provide a brief summary of geometric algebra. We write Cliﬀord vectors in lower case (a) and general
multivectors (Cliﬀord aggregate) in upper case (A). The space of multivectors is graded and multivectors containing
elements of a single grade, r, are termed homogeneous and written Ar. The geometric (Cliﬀord) product is written by
simply juxtaposing multivectors AB. A basic operation on multivectors is the degree projection hAir which selects
from the multivector A its r− vector part (0 = scalar, 1 = vector, 2 = bivector ....). We write the scalar (grade-0)
part simply as hAi . The geometric product of a grade-r multivector Ar with a grade-s multivector Bs decomposes
into ArBs = hABi r+s + hABi r+s−2 ... + hABi |r−s| . The inner and outer (or exterior) products are the lowest-grade

3

and the highest-grade terms respectively of the above series Ar · Bs ≡ hABi |r−s| , and Ar ∧ Bs ≡ hABi r+s . For
vectors a and b we have ab = a · b + a ∧ b, where a · b ≡ (1/2)(ab + ba), and a ∧ b ≡ (1/2)(ab − ba). Reversion is an
a = a, for any vector a, and it reverses the order of
B
invariant kind of conjugation, which is deﬁned by
vectors in any given expression.

e
In such a geometric approach physical quantities in the 4D spacetime are represented by Cliﬀord multivectors.
They are deﬁned without reference frames (when no basis has been introduced), the absolute quantities (AQs), or,
equivalently, they are written as coordinate-based geometric quantities (CBGQs) comprising both components and a
basis (when some basis has been introduced). Thus these quantities are independent of the chosen inertial frame of
reference and of the chosen system of coordinates in it, i.e., they are observer independent quantities.

In the treatments, e.g., [1-3], one usualy introduces the standard basis. The generators of the spacetime algebra
(the Cliﬀord algebra generated by Minkowski spacetime) are taken to be four basis vectors {γµ} , µ = 0...3, satisfying
γµ · γν = ηµν = diag(+ − −−). This basis, the standard basis {γµ}, is a right-handed orthonormal frame of vectors
in the Minkowski spacetime M 4 with γ0 in the forward light cone. The γk (k = 1, 2, 3) are spacelike vectors. The γµ
generate by multiplication a complete basis for the spacetime algebra: 1, γµ, γµ ∧ γν , γµγ5,γ5 (24 = 16 independent
elements). γ5 is the pseudoscalar for the frame {γµ} .

We remark that the standard basis corresponds, in fact, to the speciﬁc system of coordinates, i.e., the Einstein
system of coordinates, of the chosen inertial frame of reference. (In the Einstein system of coordinates the Einstein
synchronization [16] of distant clocks and Cartesian space coordinates xi are used in the chosen inertial frame of
reference.) However diﬀerent systems of coordinates of an inertial frame of reference are allowed and they are all
equivalent in the description of physical phenomena. For example, in [10] (and the second and third paper in [11])
two very diﬀerent, but completely equivalent systems of coordinates, the Einstein system of coordinates and ”radio”
(”r”) system of coordinates, are exposed and exploited throughout the paper.

µ = .... = x′µ

Thence instead of the standard basis {γµ} , µ = 0...3, for M 4 we can use some basis {eµ} (the metric tensor of M 4
is then deﬁned as gµν = eµ · eν) and its dual basis {eµ} , where the set of basis vectors eµ is related to the eµ by the
conditions eµ · eν = δν
µ. The pseudoscalar e5 of a frame {eµ} is deﬁned by e5 = e0 ∧ e1 ∧ ∧e2 ∧ e3. Then, e.g., the
position 1-vector x can be decomposed in the S and S′ frames and in the standard basis {γµ} and some non-standard
basis {eµ} as x = xµγµ = x′µγ′
µ. The primed quantities are the Lorentz transforms of the unprimed
ones. Similarly any multivector A can be written as an invariant quantity with the components and a basis, i.e., as a
CBGQ. In such interpretation the Lorentz transformations (LT) are considered as passive transformations; both the
components and the basis vectors are transformed but the whole geometric quantity remains unchanged. Thus we
see that under the passive LT a well-deﬁned quantity on the 4D spacetime, i.e., a CBGQ, is an invariant quantity.
In the usual Cliﬀord algebra formalism, e.g., [1-4], the LT are considered as active transformations; the components
of, e.g., some 1-vector relative to a given inertial frame of reference (with the standard basis {γµ}) are transformed
into the components of a new 1-vector relative to the same frame (the basis {γµ} is not changed). (We note that a
coordinate-free form for the LT is presented in [13] and [10] and it can be used both in an active way, when there is
no basis, or in a passive way, when some basis is introduced.)

e e′

In this paper, for the sake of brevity and of clearness of the whole exposition, we shall work only with the standard
basis {γµ}, but remembering that the approach with 4D quantities that are deﬁned without reference frames holds
for any choice of the basis.

III. SHORT REVIEW OF THE INVARIANT SPECIAL RELATIVITY

The presented formulation of electromagnetism with the F ﬁeld exclusively deals with well-deﬁned 4D quantities,
AQs or CBGQs. The SR that exclusively deals with AQs or, equivalently, with CBGQs, can be called the invariant
SR. The reason for this name is that upon the passive LT any CBGQ remains unchanged. The invariance of some 4D
CBGQ upon the passive LT reﬂects the fact that such mathematical, invariant, geometric 4D quantity represents the
same physical object for relatively moving observers. It is taken in the invariant SR that such 4D geometric quantities
are well-deﬁned not only mathematically but also experimentally, as measurable quantities with real physical meaning.
Thus they have an independent physical reality. The invariant SR is discussed in [10-12] in the tensor formalism and
in [13] in the Cliﬀord algebra formalism. In [14,15] both formalisms are used. It is explicitly shown in [11] that the
true agreement with experiments that test SR exists when the theory deals with such well-deﬁned 4D quantities, i.e.,
the quantities that are invariant upon the passive LT. The principle of relativity is automatically included in such
formulation with observer independent quantities, i.e., in the invariant SR, whereas in the traditional formulation of
SR [16] this principle acts as the postulate established outside the mathematical formulation of the theory. The F
formulation of the electromagnetism that is presented here is a part of the invariant SR.

In the invariant SR one can formulate classical electromagnetism not only with the F ﬁeld but also with well-
deﬁned 4D quantities representing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Let us brieﬂy describe the connection between the

4

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

formulation with the Faraday bivector ﬁeld F (presented here) and the formulations with the geometric 4D quantities
representing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Such latter formulations are considered in [13] (and [15]). One of them
uses the decomposition of F into 1-vectors E and B

F = (1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v,
E = (1/c)F · v, B = −(1/c2)I(F ∧ v),

where I is the unit pseudoscalar. (I is deﬁned algebraically without introducing any reference frame, as in [4] Sec.
1.2.) It holds that E · v = B · v = 0 (since F is skew-symmetric). v in (4) can be interpreted as the velocity (1-vector)
of a family of observers who measures E and B ﬁelds. The velocity v and all other quantities entering into (4) are
deﬁned without reference frames; they are AQs. v characterizes some general observer. Thus the relations (4) hold for
any observer. (For the equivalent relations with v in the tensor formalism see also [17].) The relations (4) actually
establish the equivalence of the formulation of electromagnetism with the ﬁeld bivector F (that is presented here and
partially in [13]) and the formulation with 1-vectors of the electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds (that is presented in [13]).
Both formulations, with F and E, B ﬁelds, are equivalent formulations, but every of them is a complete, consistent
and self-contained formulation.

In [15] the shortcomings of the usual (e.g., [5]) identiﬁcation (3) of components of F αβ with components of the 3D
E and B are discussed. Similarly in [15] (see also the second paper in [14]) it is shown that the relations (1) from
[1,2] have to be replaced by the relations

F = EHv + cIBHv, EHv = (1/c2)(F · v) ∧ v

BHv = −(1/c3)I[(F ∧ v) · v].

Namely in (1) a space-time split in the γ0 - frame is used and, as it is already said, it depends on the velocity cγ0
of the speciﬁc observer, the γ0 - observer. Thus in (1) the observer independent quantity F is decomposed into the
observer dependent quantities EH, BH deﬁned only in the γ0 - frame. A space-time split is not a Lorentz invariant
procedure. On the other hand in (5) the velocity cγ0 of the speciﬁc observer is replaced by the velocity v of some
general observer. v is an AQ and thence the relations (5), in the same way as the relations (4), hold for any observer.
(Of course the same procedure, the replacement of cγ0 by v, has to be undertaken in (2).) Then, instead of formulating
the whole electromagnetism by 1-vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B respectively, one can formulate
it by bivectors EHv and BHv. The only diﬀerence is that the decomposition of F into 1-vectors E and B (4) is
much simpler and, in fact, closer to the classical formulation of the electromagnetism with the 3D E and B, than the
decomposition of F into bivectors EHv and BHv (5).

(It is worth noting that in [13] we also presented the formulations of electromagnetism in terms of some real and
complex combinations of 1-vectors E and B; the formulations with the real multivector Ψ = E − cIB and with the
complex 1-vector Ψ = E − icB. The relations that connect the F formulation and the real Ψ formulation are

The multivector Ψ is not a homogeneous multivector but a mixed-grade multivector; it is the sum of grade-1 and
grade-3 multivectors. Similarly the F formulation and the complex Ψ formulation are connected by the relations

Ψ = (−1/c)(vF ), F = (−1/c)(vΨ),

Ψ = (1/c)F · v + (i/c)I(F ∧ v),
F = (1/2c)(Ψ + Ψ) ∧ v + (i/2c)

I(Ψ − Ψ)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

· v,

where i is the unit imaginary and Ψ is the complex reversion of Ψ. In contrast to the real Ψ, which is a multivector
of a mixed grade, the complex Ψ is a homogeneous, grade-1, multivector. This fact facilitates the calculation in some
cases, particularly when one considers the relativistic quantum mechanics. Notice also that for the complex Ψ it holds
that v · Ψ = v · Ψ = 0 as for 1-vectors E and B.)

All these formulations with the electric and magnetic ﬁelds represented by diﬀerent multivectors are equivalent to
the formulation with the F ﬁeld, but every of them is an independent, consistent and complete formulation. (However
it has to be remarked that in the formulations of electromagnetism in [13] with E, B, the real and complex Ψ the
expressions for the stress-energy vector T (v) and all quantities derived from T (v) are written for the special case
when v, the velocity of observers who measure E and B ﬁelds is v = cn, where n is the unit normal to a hypersurface
through which the ﬂow of energy-momentum (T (n)) is calculated. The more general case with v 6= n will be reported
in detail elsewhere.)

From the above consideration we conclude that, in contrast to the formulation with F , all formulations with the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds, or their combinations, as AQs require the introduction of v, the velocity of observers

who measure ﬁelds. This is the reason why the formulation with the bivector ﬁeld F will be ﬁrst investigated and
presented in this paper.

It is important to mention that the observer independent quantities introduced here and the ﬁeld equations written

in terms of them are of the same form both in the ﬂat and curved spacetimes.

IV. THE F FORMULATION OF ELECTROMAGNETISM

A. The determination of the electromagnetic ﬁeld F

We start the exposition of classical electromagnetism by the description of the ﬁrst step in the ﬁeld view of particle-
to-particle interaction; the determination of F for the given sources. As it is already said this is an axiomatic
formulation of the electromagnetism with only one postulated equation; it is the ﬁeld equation written in terms of
F [1-3] (a single ﬁeld equation for F is ﬁrst given by M. Riesz [18]). In that equation an electromagnetic ﬁeld is
represented by a bivector-valued function F = F (x) on the spacetime. The source of the ﬁeld is the electromagnetic
current j which is a 1-vector ﬁeld. Using that the gradient operator ∂ is a 1-vector ﬁeld this equation can be written
as

∂F = j/ε0c,

∂ · F + ∂ ∧ F = j/ε0c.

(8)

The trivector part is identically zero in the absence of magnetic charge. Notice that in [18], [19] and [1-3] the ﬁeld
equation (8) is considered to encode all of the ME. Thus it is assumed in all usual approaches in the Cliﬀord algebra
formalism that the ﬁeld equation (8) and the usual ME with the 3D E and B (i.e., with EH , BH or EJ , BJ from
[1-3]) are physically equivalent. However it is proved in [15] that, contrary to the general belief, such equivalence does
not exist. It is shown in [15] that the ﬁeld equation with F (8) is equivalent to the ME with the 3D E and B (i.e.,
with EH , BH or EJ , BJ from [1-3]) in an arbitrary chosen inertial frame of reference. Namely in that frame with
the Einstein system of coordinates in it (the {γµ} basis) v, in (4) or (5), is speciﬁed to be in the time direction, i.e.,
v = cγ0 (it is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, for this name see [20]). This means that in that frame the observers
who measure electric and magnetic ﬁelds, e.g., EHv, BHv from (5), or E, B from (4), are at rest, “ﬁducial” observers,
i.e., for them v = cγ0. In that frame of “ﬁducial” observers all results of the classical electromagnetism with the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds are recovered; (5) becomes (1), and (4) transforms to the relations in which v is replaced
by cγ0 and E and B become the 1-vectors Ef and Bf (f stands for “ﬁducial”)

F = Ef ∧ γ0 + c(γ5Bf ) · γ0,
Ef = F · γ0, Bf = −(1/c)γ5(F ∧ γ0).

(γ5 is the unit pseudoscalar I for the {γµ} basis.) However this equivalence between the F formulation with the ﬁeld
equation (8) and the usual formulation with the ME written in terms of the 3D E and B does not hold for all other
relatively moving observers. The reason is that, as proved in [15], the ME with the 3D E and B (i.e., with EH ,
BH (1) or EJ , BJ (2) from [1-3]) are not covariant upon the LT but upon the standard transformations, whereas the
ﬁeld equation (8) is not only covariant but invariant upon the LT. Really when (8) is written as a coordinate-based
geometric equation (CBGE) then every CBGQ in (8) is invariant upon the LT. On the other hand it is proved in the
ﬁrst paper in [14] (the tensor formalism) and in the second paper in [14] (the Cliﬀord algebra formalism) that the
standard transformations of the 3D E and B, see, e.g., [5], Jackson’s book Sec. 11.10., or [5], Gravitation, eqs. (3.5)
and (3.24), (i.e., of EH , BH or EJ , BJ from [1-3], see, e.g., [1], Space-Time Algebra, eq. (18.22), New Foundations
for Classical Mechanics, Ch. 9 eqs. (3.51a,b)) drastically diﬀer from the LT. All this together shows that the ﬁeld
equation (8) is, in fact, a relativistically correct generalization of the usual ME with the 3D E and B.

When (8) is written as a CBGE in the γ0-frame with the {γµ} basis it becomes

∂αF αβγβ − (1/2)εαβγδ∂αFγδγ5γβ = (1/ε0c)jβγβ,

where εαβγδ is the totally skew-symmetric Levi-Civita pseudotensor. In (10) AQs from (8) are written as CBGQs in
the {γµ} basis; F = (1/2)F αβγα ∧γβ (the basis components F αβ are determined as F αβ = γβ ·(γα ·F ) = (γβ ∧γα)·F ).
From the CBGE (10) one easily ﬁnds the usual covariant form (thus only the basis components of the 4D geometric
quantities in the {γµ} basis) of the ﬁeld equation as

where the usual dual tensor is introduced ∗F αβ = (1/2)εαβγδFγδ.

∂αF aβ = jβ/ε0c,

∂α

∗F αβ = 0,

(10)

(11)

It is shown in [13] that when the ﬁeld equation (8) is written in terms of 1-vectors E and B from (4) it becomes

Similarly when (8) is written in terms of the real multivector Ψ from (6) it becomes

and with the complex 1-vector Ψ from (7) it is

∂ [(1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v] = j/ε0c.

∂(vΨ) = −j/ε0,

∂ · (v ∧ Ψ) − iI [∂ ∧ (v ∧ Ψ)] = −j/ε0.

This form of the ﬁeld equation (14) (in which Ψ does not appear) is achieved separating vector and trivector parts
and then combining them to eliminate Ψ.

The ﬁeld bivector F yields the complete description of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and, in fact, there is no need to
introduce either the ﬁeld vectors or the potentials. For the given sources the Cliﬀord algebra formalism enables one
to ﬁnd in a simple way the electromagnetic ﬁeld F. Namely the gradient operator ∂ is invertible and (8) can be solved
for

F = ∂−1(j/ε0c),

see, e.g., [19] and [1] Spacetime Calculus. We brieﬂy repeat the main points related to (15) from these references.
However, the important diﬀerence with respect to the usual approaches [1-3] is that for us, as proved in [14] and [15],
the ﬁeld equation (8) is not equivalent to the usual ME with the 3D E and B (i.e., with EH , BH or EJ , BJ ). ∂−1 is
an integral operator which depends on boundary conditions on F and (15) is an integral form of the ﬁeld equation (8).
If the charge-current density j(x) is the sole source of F, then (15) provides the unique solution to the ﬁeld equation
(8). By using Gauss’ Theorem an important formula can be found that allows to calculate F at any point y inside
m-dimensional manifold M from its derivative ∂F and its values on the boundary ∂M if a Green’s function G(y, x)
is known,

F (y) =

G(y, x)∂F (x) | dmx | −

G(y, x)n−1F (x) | dm−1x |,

(16)

ZM

Z∂M

n is a unit normal, n−1 = n if n2 = 1 or n−1 = −n if n2 = −1, and G(y, x) is a solution to the diﬀerential equation
∂yG(y, x) = δm(y − x). ((16) is the relation (4.17) in [19].) If ∂F = 0, i.e., j = 0, the ﬁrst term on the right side of
(16) vanishes but not the second term. This general relation can be applied to diﬀerent examples.

B. The electromagnetic ﬁeld of a point charge

An example is the determination of the expression for the classical Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld that is given, e.g., in
[19] and [1] Spacetime Calculus. The usual procedure ([19] and [1]) is to utilize the general relation (16), in which all
quantities are deﬁned without reference frames (Geometric calculus), and to specify it to the Minkowski spacetime
(m = 4). Then a space-time split is introduced by the relation

ct = x · n = x · γ0.

(n in (16) is taken to be γ0 and (17) is the equation for a 1-parameter family of spacelike hyperplanes S(t) with normal
γ0; S(t) is a surface of simultaneous t when the Einstein synchronization is chosen.) For simplicity, M is taken to be
the entire region between the hyperplanes S1 = S(t1) and S2 = S(t2). We shall not discuss this derivation further
but we only quote the result for the classical Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld. The charge-current density for a particle with
−∞ dτ uδ4(x − z(τ )), where u = u(τ ) = dz/dτ . Then
charge q and world line z = z(τ ) with proper time τ is j(x) = q
the classical Li´enard-Wiechert retarded ﬁeld for q (see, e.g., Sec. 5 in [19]) is

where r = x − z satisﬁes the light-cone condition r2 = 0 and z, u,
u = du/dτ are all evaluated at the intersection
of the backward light cone (with vertex at x) and world line of that charge q.
It is worth noting that from the
general expression (16) one can derive not only the retarded interpretation for F of a charge q but also the advanced
interpretation and the present-time interpretation, i.e., an instantaneous action-at-a-distance interpretation. (This

present-time interpretation will be reported elsewhere. In the tensor formalism the expressions for F ab and the 4-
vectors Ea and Ba in the present-time interpretation for an uniform and uniformly accelerated motion of a charge q
are given in [21].)

All quantities in (18) are geometric 4D quantities, the AQs, and for more practical use they can be written as

CBGQs, usually in the {γµ} basis. Thus, the general expression for F for an arbitrary motion of a charge is

F = (1/2)F αβγα ∧ γβ, F αβ = (kq/ζ3)

In (19), rµ = xµ − zµ(τ ), xµ and zµ(τ ) are the ﬁeld and the source basis components of x and z respectively (in
the {γµ} basis), k = 1/4πε0 and ζ ≡ rσuσ. The right-hand side has to be evaluated at τ0 such that xµ − zµ(τ0) is
light-like, i.e., τ0 is determined by the above mentioned light-cone condition, which in the component form becomes
(xσ − zσ(τ0))(xσ − zσ(τ0)) = 0, and it holds that x0 − z0(τ0) =| r |≻ 0. The expression for F αβ from (19) is the
standard result, e.g., Jackson’s book [5]. The ﬁrst term in F αβ (19) represents the velocity part and the second one
represents the acceleration or radiation part. (However we note that such decomposition of F αβ into velocity and
acceleration parts is the consequence of the used retarded representation and does not exist for, e.g., the present time
representation [21].) We see that from (18) one can simply ﬁnd the well-known result for F αβ given in (19).

The components F αβ are measurable quantities; they can be measured using the Lorentz force and Newton’s second

law as will be discussed in Sec. IV. D.

Let us specify the above relations to the case of a point charge with constant velocity u, see for the comparison
Sec. 7.3.2 in [2]. Then the trajectory is z(τ ) = uτ (taking that z(0) = 0), r · u/c = |x ∧ (u/c)|, r ∧ (u/c) = x ∧ (u/c).
Substituting these relations into (18) one ﬁnds the ﬁeld strength F

F (x) = kq(x ∧ (u/c))/ |x ∧ (u/c)|3 = N (x ∧ (u/c)),

where N = kq/ |x ∧ (u/c)|3. As correctly argued in [2] this solution for F (20) (it is eq. (7.94) in [2]) could be obtained
R.
by transforming (with the LT) the Coulomb ﬁeld F0 (for the charge at rest in the γ0-frame) via F0 → F = RF0(

β is the scalar velocity in units of c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2, see, e.g., [1-3]. For the charge at rest in the γ0-frame F0 is

R = (1 + γ − γβγ0γ1)/(2(1 + γ))1/2,

F0 = N (x ∧ γ0) = N (xkγk ∧ γ0) = N x,

where x′1 = γx1 − βγx0, x′2 = x2 and x′3 = x3. Now the basis components F ij are also diﬀerent from zero.

In all usual formulations of the electromagnetism both in the Cliﬀord algebra [1-3] and tensor formalisms [5] the
results (18) or F αβ from (19) are considered only as formal, mathematical results that are necessary to ﬁnd the
components of the “physical” quantities, the 3D E and B. But the relations (15), (16) and (18) show that F has an
independent physical reality and the whole electromagnetism can be treated with F without even mentioning the 3D
E and B. Consequently, in contrast to the usual approaches [1-3], and all other previous approaches, we assume that
the 4D geometric quantity F can be considered as the primary physical quantity and not the 3D vectors E and B.
Then from the known F one can ﬁnd diﬀerent 4D quantities that represent electric and magnetic ﬁelds and compare
these results with the traditional ones.

1. Constant velocity. AQs EHv, BHv and E, B from F

As an example we shall use (20) and (5) to determine the electric and magnetic ﬁelds EHv and BHv respectively

and compare it with the results in [2]. Thence we ﬁnd

EHv = (N/c3)[(u · v)(x ∧ v) − (x · v)(u ∧ v)]
BHv = (N/c4)I[(x · v)(u ∧ v) − (u · v)(x ∧ v) + c2(x ∧ u)].

Both EHv and BHv from (24) are AQs, i.e., they are deﬁned without reference frames. Remember that v is the
velocity (1-vector) of a family of observers who measures EHv and BHv ﬁelds and u is the velocity (1-vector) of a
point charge.

Using (4) and F from (20) we get physically equivalent but simpler expressions

E = (N/c2)[(u · v)x − (x · v)u]
B = (−N/c3)I(x ∧ u ∧ v),

in which the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are represented by 1-vectors E and B.

We note that EHv, BHv (E, B) from (24) ((25)) and F from (20) contain the same amount of physical informations.
The expressions with AQs EHv, BHv from (24) (E, B from (25)) were not found in any previous approach including
[1-3]. The usual results can be recovered simply taking that the observers who measure EHv, BHv (E, B) ﬁelds are
at rest, “ﬁducial” observers (the γ0-frame with the {γµ} basis), for which v = cγ0 in (24) ((25)). Then the relations
(24) become

H,st = [F · γ0] ∧ γ0 = γN (−Ut + x)
H,st = −(1/c)γ5{F ∧ γ0} · γ0 = (1/c2)N γ5(xsp ∧ usp),

where the relative vector u =u ∧ γ0 = ukγk ∧ γ0, U = u/γ corresponds to the 3-velocity, xsp = xkγk and usp = uiγi
denote the spatial parts of x and u (the subscript sp is for “spatial part”), and in the standard basis {γµ} the
pseudoscalar I is denoted as γ5. E′
H,st (the subscript st is for “standard”) from (26) correspond to the
usual expressions for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a charge in uniform motion. They are the expressions (7.97)
from [2].

H,st and B′

In the same way the relations (25) become

Ef = N (γx − ut), Bf = (−N/c2)γ5(x ∧ u ∧ γ0).

Notice that E0
Ef , Bf contain only spatial components.

f = B0

f = 0 which means that in the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, the γ0-frame with the {γµ} basis,

Particularly for a charge at rest in the γ0-frame with the {γµ} basis, v = u = cγ0. Then from (24), or from (5) and

the expression for F0 (22), we ﬁnd that only E0H , the Coulomb electric ﬁeld, is diﬀerent from zero

Similarly from (25), or from (4) and the expression for F0 (22), we ﬁnd

E0H = [F0 · γ0] ∧ γ0 = F0 = N x, B0H = 0.

E0f = N xsp, B0f = 0,

which shows that only E0f , the Coulomb electric ﬁeld, is diﬀerent from zero.

An important remark is at place here. It refers to the diﬀerence between the F formulation of electromagnetism
and the formulations with 4D quantities representing electric and magnetic ﬁelds. It is shown above that F (20) for
the uniform motion is obtained by the LT of F0 (22) for the charge at rest. However it can be easily seen that when
the LT are applied to E0H and B0H (28) they yield E′
H,st given by
(26). Thus

H,st (26) (Ef , Bf (27)) for a charge moving with constant velocity u, are
obtained using (24) ((25)) and taking that the frame of “ﬁducial” observers (for which v = cγ0) is the frame in which
that charge is at rest (u = cγ0) for the ﬁrst case and in uniform motion for the second case. At the same time this

C. The integral form of the ﬁeld equation (8)

Instead of dealing with the axiomatic formulation of electromagnetism that uses only the local form of the ﬁeld
equation (8) one can construct the equivalent integral form. Such form is constructed by Hestenes and nicely presented
in [19] and [1] Space-Time Calculus, though, Hestenes does not consider it as an axiomatic formulation. Here only
the main results from [19] and [1] will be brieﬂy repeated and applied to the determination of F (and E, B) for some
simple cases.

The trivector part of (8) ∂ ∧ F = 0 can be transformed to an equivalent integral form as

d2x · F = 0,

I∂M

where in the directed integral (31), in general, dmx is the directed measure and ∂M is any closed 2-dimensional
submanifold in spacetime. dmx can be resolved into its magnitude |dmx|, which is the usual “scalar measure,” and its
direction represented by a unit m-blade Im: dmx = Im |dmx|, or in terms of CBGQs dmx = d1x ∧ d2x ∧ ... ∧ dmx =
e1 ∧ e2 ∧ ...emdx1dx2...dxm, where dxµ is a scalar diﬀerential for the scalar variable xµ and eµ is the basis 1-vector for
some basis {eµ}. In order to ﬁnd the corresponding integral forms with the electric and magnetic ﬁelds Hestenes, [19]
and [1], uses the space-time split given by (1) and shows that (31) is equivalent to Faraday’s law or “the absence of
magnetic poles,” or a mixture of the two, depending on the choice of ∂M . However, as we have said, the use of such
procedure, a space-time split in the γ0-frame, transforms the integral ﬁeld equation (31) written in terms of AQs into
observer dependent integral ﬁeld equation written in terms of observer dependent EH and BH from (1). Instead of
using such procedure we express F in (31) in terms of AQs EHv, BHv from (24) or E, B from (4) to ﬁnd equivalent,
coordinate-free, integral forms with electric and magnetic ﬁelds as AQs, e.g., with E and B

d2x · ((1/c)E ∧ v + (IB) · v) = 0.

I∂M

Then going to the frame of “ﬁducial” observers (for which v = cγ0), the γ0-frame with the {γµ} basis, E and B
become Ef and Bf , which contain only spatial components, and we recover the usual integral form of Faraday’s law
and Gauss’ law for a magnetic ﬁeld or a mixture of the two, depending on the choice of ∂M .
Hestenes also derived an integral formula for the vector part of the local ﬁeld equation (8)

where n = n(x) is a unit outward normal and M is any 3-dimensional submanifold in spacetime that is enclosed by
∂M . In [19] and [1] the equation (33) is also written in the less familiar form

where h...iI selects only the “invariant (= scalar+pseudoscalar) parts.” Of course the whole discussion that led from
(31) to (32) applies in the same measure to the equations (33) (or (34)) and (35) and the corresponding expressions

with AQs EHv, BHv from (24) or E, B from (4). We notice that when F is decomposed in terms of electric and
magnetic ﬁelds then the equation (33), or (34), in the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, becomes the Amp`ere-Maxwell
law, the Gauss law for an electric ﬁeld or a mixture of the two, depending on the choice of ∂M .

In the usual approach with the 3D E and B and for some simple cases one can determine, e.g., the 3D E, directly
from the integral version of the Gauss law. Similarly instead of to ﬁnd F from (16) one can get it, e.g., from the
equation (33) (or (34)). Let us consider a ﬂat sheet inﬁnite in extent, with the constant surface charge density σ.
We can use (4) to connect the F formulation with the formulation that deals with the electric and magnetic ﬁelds E
and B respectively. For the sake of easier comparison with the common approach with the 3D E and B we introduce
the γ0-frame (with the {γµ} basis) in which the ﬂat sheet is at rest and situated in the γ1 ∧ γ2 plane. In the usual
application of Gauss’ law with the 3D E a convenient Gaussian surface in the 3D space is chosen to be a “pill box”
piercing a cross-sectional area S on the ﬂat sheet and whose height is 2a. In the 4D spacetime ∂M in the equation
(33) is chosen to be the same closed 2-dimensional surface as above (a “pill box”) that is instantaneously taken, i.e.,
it is at rest, in the γ0-frame. When F is written as a CBGQ in the {γµ} basis it becomes

F = F i0γi ∧ γ0 + (1/2)F klγk ∧ γl.

This is a decomposition of F into “electriclike” (the ﬁrst part) and “magneticlike” (the second part), but we note that
such decomposition of F as in (36) is not a Lorentz invariant decomposition. From (4), i.e., from (36) and (9) (the
chosen γ0-frame is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, v = cγ0), and by analogy with the corresponding 3D formulation,
we conclude that only F 30 6= 0 and it is of constant magnitude. Then the equation (33) becomes 2SF 30 = S(σ/ε0)
whence

F = F 30γ3 ∧ γ0 = (σ/2ε0)γ3 ∧ γ0

This example will be used in comparison with experiments that is considered in Sec. VI.

In our axiomatic formulation of electromagnetism there is only one postulated equation, either the local ﬁeld equation
(8) or its equivalent integral version (35), whereas, as we have already mentioned, in the recent axiomatic formulation
of electromagnetism [8] there are three postulated equations; (1) electric charge conservation, (2) the Lorentz force,
(3) magnetic ﬂux conservation. Using these three postulated equations and foliation of spacetime (what is nothing
else than the space-time split) the authors of [8] derive the usual form of ME with the 3D E and B. Their axiom 3
simply follows from the equation (31) and in the next sections, IV. F and D, we shall show that not only axiom 3 but
also the axioms 1 and 2 from [8] simply follow from our equation (8), or (35).

D. The Lorentz force and the motion of a charged particle in
the electromagnetic ﬁeld F

As we said in the ﬁeld view of particle-to-particle interaction the electrodynamic interaction between charges is
described as two-steps process; ﬁrst ﬁelds are seen as being generated from their particle sources and then the ﬁelds so
generated are perceived as interacting with some target particle. The description of the ﬁrst step in the F formulation
of electrodynamics is given by the above relations (8) (or (35)), (15), (16) and for a point particle with charge q with
(18). The second step requires the determination of the Lorentz force in terms of F and its use in Newton’s second
law. This will be undertaken below.

In the Cliﬀord algebra formalism one can easily derive the expressions for the stress-energy vector T (n) and the
j/ε0c

Lorentz force density K directly from the ﬁeld equation (8) and from the equation for
∂ diﬀerentiates to the left instead of to the right). Indeed, using (8) and from the equation for
(

F , the reverse of F,

∂ =

T (∂) = (−ε0/2)(F ∂F ) = j · F/c = −Kj,

where in (F ∂F ) the derivative ∂ operates to the left and to the right by the chain rule. The stress-energy vector T (n)
[1-3] for the electromagnetic ﬁeld is then deﬁned in the F formulation as

T (n) = T (n(x), x) = −(ε0/2) hF nF i1 .

We note that T (n) is a vector-valued linear function on the tangent space at each spacetime point x describing the
ﬂow of energy-momentum through a hypersurface with normal n = n(x).

The right hand side of (38) yields the expression for the Lorentz force density K(j),

K(j) = F · j/c.

(44)

The Lorentz force in the F formulation for a charge q is K = (q/c)F · u, where u is the velocity 1-vector of a charge
q (it is deﬁned to be the tangent to its world line).

It is worth noting that the equation (40) is the second postulate, axiom 2, in the axiomatic formulation of elec-
tromagnetism [8]. As seen from the above consideration in our approach (40) simply follows from the ﬁeld equation
(8).

In the approaches [1,2] the Lorentz force is discussed using the space-time split and the corresponding decomposition
of F into the electric and magnetic components. However in the analysis of the motion of a charged particle under
the action of the Lorentz force we utilize only those parts of the usual approaches [1-3] that are expressed only in
terms of F and not those expressed by EH, BH or EJ , BJ . We shall only quote the main results from [1-3] for the
motion of a charged particle in a constant electromagnetic ﬁeld F but without using EH , BH or EJ , BJ . Actually,
as shown in Sec. IV. B1, instead of dealing with the decomposition of F as an AQ into the observer dependent EH ,
BH (1) or EJ , BJ (2) as in [1-3] one has to make the decomposition of the AQ F into AQs EHv, BHv (24) or E, B
(25). Then going to the frame of “ﬁducial” observers, v = cγ0, one recovers in that frame the usual results [1-3] with
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

The particle equation of motion, i.e., Newton’s second law is

where

•
u = du/dτ ; the overdot denotes diﬀerentation with respect to proper time τ . Usually [1,2] the equation (41)

•
R = (q/2m)F R and using the invariant canonical form for F,

is not solved directly but solving the rotor equation
which is

•
u = qF · u,

m

F = f eIϕ = f (cos ϕ + I sin ϕ);

f 2

this holds for F 2 6= 0. In that form f 2 =
, which shows that f is a “timelike bivector,” but If is a “spacelike
bivector,” since (If )2 = −
. The equation (42) is the unique decomposition of F into a sum of mutually commuting
timelike and spacelike parts. As shown in, e.g., [1] Space-Time Calculus, both f and ϕ can be written in terms of F ,
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
i.e., invariants under the LT that are constructed from F ; α = F · F , Iβ = F ∧ F . Thus eIϕ = (α + Iβ)1/2/(α2 + β2)1/4
and f = F (α − Iβ)1/2/(α2 + β2)1/4. The same invariant decomposition of F is given in [3] Chap. 6 par.3, where F
is written as F = F1 + F2 and it can be shown that F1 (F2) from [3] is exactly equal to f cos ϕ (f I sin ϕ) from [1].
Note the diﬀerence between the decomposition of F presented in (36) and that one given in (42); the ﬁrst one is a
coordinate-dependent presentation whereas the second one is given in terms of AQs.

Let us consider that F is an uniform electromagnetic ﬁeld and let us apply the decomposition (42). Then denoting
(q/m)F = Ω, Ω1 = f (q/m) cos ϕ, Ω2 = f (q/m) sin ϕ, and making an invariant decomposition of the initial velocity
u(0) into a component u1 in the f -plane and a component u2 orthogonal to the f -plane, u(0) = f −1(f ·u(0))+ f −1(f ∧
u(0)) = u1 + u2, we get

u = e(1/2)Ω1τ u1 + e(1/2)Ω2τ u2.

As stated in [1], Spacetime Calculus, this is an invariant decomposition of the motion into ”electriclike” and ”mag-
neticlike” components. The particle history is obtained integrating (43)

x(τ ) − x(0) = (e(1/2)Ω1τ − 1)Ω−1

1 u1 + e(1/2)Ω2τ Ω−1

2 u2.

(For more details see [1-3].) This result applies for arbitrary initial conditions and arbitrary uniform electromagnetic
ﬁeld F . Diﬀerent special cases of the equation (44) that correspond to the motion of a charge in uniform electric
or magnetic ﬁelds are already considered, using only F , in, e.g., [3], and will not be considered here. Of course all
other special cases, e.g., a charge in an electromagnetic plane wave, can also be investigated exclusively in terms of F
without introducing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The solutions for the motion of a charged particle in a constant
electromagnetic ﬁeld that are similar to (43) and (44) are already considered in the usual covariant approach (thus
with F µν and not with AQ F ) in [22].

It is already mentioned that the expression for the Lorentz force in terms of F determines the way in which F ,
i.e., the components of F in some reference frame are measured. First let us assume that in the chosen reference
frame with the {γµ} basis the considered charge is at rest, u = cγ0 (in components uµ = (c, 0, 0, 0)). Then from the
expression for the Lorentz force K = (q/c)F · u and the decomposition (36) (that holds in the {γµ} basis) we ﬁnd
that only “electriclike” part of F is relevant in that case

Kui=0 = qF i0γi.

(45)

Thence we see that the relation

F i0 ≡ lim
q→0

K i

ui=0/q

deﬁnes experimentally the components (in the {γµ} basis) of “electriclike” part of F as the ratio of the measured
force Kui=0 on a stationary charge to the charge in the limit when the charge goes to zero. Having F i0γi so deﬁned
the charge can be given a convenient uniform velocity u with uk 6= 0, from which the components (in the {γµ} basis)
of “magneticlike” part of F in the decomposition (36) are deﬁned from the limit

F ikuk ≡ lim
q→0

K i/q,

i 6= k.

It is worth noting that in the usual approaches the components of the 3D E and B are deﬁned experimentally in
exactly the same way through the 3D Lorentz force.

Instead of such coordinate-dependent formulation we can generalize relations (46) and (47) comparing them with
the results for measuring E and B from [13]. Let us introduce as in (4) the velocity 1-vector v of a family of observers
who measures F ﬁeld and consider a special case, the Lorentz force acting on a charge as measured by a comoving
observer (v = u). Then from the deﬁnition of K and (4) one ﬁnds that K = (q/c)F · u = (q/c)F · v = qE. Thence we
can say that the Lorentz force ascribed by an observer comoving with a charge is purely electric and we deﬁne

where FE is “electriclike” part of F . In the γ0-frame with the {γµ} basis (48) reduces to (45) and (46) since v = cγ0.
Having FE so deﬁned the charge can be given a convenient uniform velocity u 6= v from which “magneticlike” part of
F can be deﬁned from the limit

FE · v/c ≡ lim
q→0

Kv=u/q,

F · u/c ≡ lim
q→0

K/q.

In the γ0-frame with the {γµ} basis and when the deﬁnitions (45) (or (46)) are also used then the relation (49)
reduces to (47). This completely deﬁnes the manner in which F is measured by an arbitrary observer. All this
together explicitly shows that F is a measurable quantity with a well-deﬁned physical procedure for the measurement.

E. The stress-energy vector T (n) and the quantities derived from T (n)

The most important quantity for the momentum and energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is the observer independent

stress-energy vector T (n) (39). It can be written in the following form

We present a new form for T (n) (50) writing it as a sum of n-parallel part (n− k) and n-orthogonal part (n− ⊥)

T (n) = −(ε0/2) [(F · F )n + 2(F · n) · F ] .

T (n) = −(ε0/2)

n

The ﬁrst term in (51) is n− k part and it yields the energy density U. Namely using T (n) and the fact that n · T (n) is
positive for any timelike vector n we construct the expression for the observer independent energy density U contained
in an electromagnetic ﬁeld as U = n · T (n) = hnT (n)i , (scalar, i.e., grade-0 multivector). Thus in terms of F and
(51) U becomes

The second term in (51) is n− ⊥ part and it is (1/c)S, where S is the observer independent expression for the Poynting
vector (1-vector),

U = (−ε0/2) hF nF ni = −(ε0/2)

(F · F ) + 2(F · n)2
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

.

and, as can be seen, n · S = 0. Thus T (n) expressed by U and S is

S = −ε0c

(F · n) · F − (F · n)2n
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

,

T (n) = U n + (1/c)S.

Notice that the decompositions of T (n), (50), (51) and (54), are all observer independent decompositions, thus with
AQs. Further the observer independent momentum density g is deﬁned as g = (1/c2)S, i.e., g is (1/c) of the n− ⊥
part from (51)

(F · n) · F − (F · n)2n
(cid:2)
From T (n) (51) one ﬁnds also the expression for the observer independent angular-momentum density M

g = −(ε0/c)

(cid:3)

.

M = (1/c)T (n) ∧ x = (1/c)U (n ∧ x) + g ∧ x.

It has to be emphasized once again that all these deﬁnitions are the deﬁnitions of the quantities that are independent
of the chosen reference frame and of the chosen system of coordinates in it; they are all AQs. As I am aware they are
not presented earlier in the literature.

All these quantities can be written in some basis {eµ} , which does not need to be the standard basis, as CBGQs.
The ﬁeld bivector F can be written as F = (1/2)F αβeα ∧ eβ where the basis components F αβ are determined as
F αβ = eβ · (eα · F ) = (eβ ∧ eα) · F . Then the quantities entering into the expressions for T (n), U, S, g and M are
F · F = −(1/2)F αβFαβ , F · n = F αβnβeα, (F · n)2 = F αβFαν nβnν and (F · n) · F = F αβFαν nβeν. Thence T (n) (50)
becomes

the energy density U (52) is

T (n) = −(ε0/2)

(1/2)F αβFβαnρeρ + 2F αβFαρnρeβ

In some basis {eµ} we can write the stress-energy vectors T µ as T µ = T (eµ) = (−ε0/2)F eµF. The components of the
T µ represent the energy-momentum tensor T µν in the {eµ} basis T µν = T µ · eν = (−ε0/2) hF eµF eνi, which reduces
to familiar tensor form

T µν = ε0

F µαgαβF βν + (1/4)F αβFαβgµν

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

In the usual Cliﬀord algebra aproach, e.g., [1,2], one makes the space-time split and considers the energy-momentum
density in the γ0-system (with the standard basis {γµ}) T 0 = T (γ0) = T (γ0); the split T 0γ0 = T 0γ0 = T 00 + T0,
separates T 0 into an energy density T 00 = T 0 · γ0 and a momentum density T0 = T 0 ∧ γ0. Then from the expression
for T µ and the relations (1) one ﬁnds [1,2] the familiar results for the energy density T 00 = (ε0/2)(E2
H) and the
Poyinting vector T0 = ε0(EH ×cBH ), where the commutator product A × B is deﬁned as A × B ≡ (1/2)(AB − BA).
However, as already said, the space-time split and the introduction of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds EH and BH
are not only unnecessary but, as shown above and in [14,15], they are are not equivalent to our general formulation
with AQs. The space-time split is not a Lorentz invariant procedure and if one wants to use the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds instead of the bivector feld F then the decompositions of F into AQs, e.g., EHv, BHv from (24), or E, B from
(4) have to be used and not the decompositions of F into the observer dependent quantities EH, BH from (1), or EJ ,
BJ from (2).

F. The local conservation laws in the F - formulation

It is well-known that from the ﬁeld equation in the F - formulation (8) one can derive a set of conserved currents.
Thus, for example, in the F - formulation one derives in the standard way that j from (8) is a conserved current.
Simply, the vector derivative ∂ is applied to the ﬁeld equation (8) which yields

(1/ε0c)∂ · j = ∂ · (∂ · F ).

Using the identity ∂ · (∂ · M (x)) ≡ 0 (M (x) is a multivector ﬁeld) one obtains the local charge conservation law

In the axiomatic formulation [8] the equation (61), the electric charge conservation, is axiom 1. We again see that
in the axiomatic formulation with the F ﬁeld the electric charge conservation is not an independent axiom but it
simply follows from the single axiom for our theory, the ﬁeld equation (8).

∂ · j = 0.

(61)

In a like manner we ﬁnd from (38) ) (which is obtained from (8)) that

∂ · T (n) = 0

for the free ﬁelds. This is a local energy-momentum conservation law. In the derivation of (38) we used the fact that
T (a) is symmetric, i.e., that a · T (b) = T (a) · b. Namely using accents the expression for T (∂) (T (∂) = (−ε0/2)(F ∂F ),
where ∂ operates to the left and to the right by the chain rule) can be written as T (∂) = ´T ( ´∂) = (−ε0/2)( ´F ´∂F +
F ´∂ ´F ) = 0, since in the absence of sources ∂F = ´F ´∂ = 0 (the accent denotes the multivector on which the derivative
acts). Then from the above mentioned symmetry of T one ﬁnds that ´T ( ´∂) · a = ∂ · T (a) = 0, ∀ const. a, which proves
the equation (62).

Inserting the expression (54) for T (n) into the local energy-momentum conservation law (62) we ﬁnd

(n · ∂)U + (1/c)∂ · S = 0.

The relation (63) is the well-known Poynting’s theorem but now completely written in terms of the observer indepen-
dent quantities. Let us introduce the standard basis {γµ} , i.e., an inertial frame of reference with the Einstein system
of coordinates, and in the {γµ} basis we choose that n = γ0, or in the component form it is nµ(1, 0, 0, 0). Then the
familiar form of Poynting’s theorem is recovered in such coordinate system

∂U/∂t + ∂iSi = 0,

i = 1, 2, 3.

It is worth noting that although U (52) and S (51), taken separately, are well-deﬁned observer independent quantities,
the relations (54), (62) and (63) reveal that only T (n) (54), as a whole quantity, i.e., the combination of U and S,
enters into a fundamental physical law, the local energy-momentum conservation law (62). Thence one can say
that only T (n) (54), as a whole quantity, does have a real physical meaning, or, better to say, a physically correct
interpretation. An interesting example that emphasizes this point is the case of an uniformly accelerated charge. In
the usual (3D) approach to the electrodynamics ([5]; Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, Sec. 6.8.) the Poynting
vector S is interpreted as an energy ﬂux due to the propagation of ﬁelds. In such an interpretation it is not clear
how the ﬁelds propagate along the axis of motion since for the ﬁeld points on the axis of motion one ﬁnds that S = 0
(there is no energy ﬂow) but at the same time U 6= 0 (there is an energy density). Our approach reveals that the
important quantity is T (n) and not S and U taken separately. T (n) is 6= 0 everywhere on the axis of motion and the
local energy-momentum conservation law (62) holds everywhere.

In the same way one can derive the local angular momentum conservation law, see [1], Space-Time Calculus.

V. 1-VECTOR LAGRANGIAN WITH F

In this section we only brieﬂy consider the Lagrangian formulation. Instead of starting and constructing the whole
theory of electromagnetism using the ﬁeld equation (8) one can formulate the whole theory in terms of the 1-vector
Lagrangian written with AQs

When L (65) is written in terms of CBGQs in the standard basis {γµ} it becomes

L = (F · ∂) · (IF ) − (IF · ∂) · F − 2(IF ) · j.

where Lα is Sudbery’s Lagrangian [23].
The variational principle is applied to

L = Lαγα, Lα = F µν (∂ν

∗Fµα) −

∗F µν (∂ν Fµα) + 2∗Fαµjµ,

The most important fact in such Lagrangian approach is that the interaction term in (65) and (66) is written
directly by means of the measurable electromagnetic ﬁeld F , and not, as usual, in terms of potentials. This will have
important consequences in many branches of physics and they will be discussed in future publications.

Using (65) and the relations that connect F with diﬀerent 4D AQs that represent electric and magnetic ﬁelds, e.g.,
E and B (4), the real Ψ (6), the complex Ψ (7), or EHv BHv from (24), one can derive the equivalent Lagrangians
with such 4D AQs.

VI. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS. AN EXPLANATION
OF THE TROUTON-NOBLE EXPERIMENT

The usual formulation of SR [16], which deals with the “apparent” transformations, the Lorentz contraction and
the dilatation of time, and the invariant SR from [10] (given in terms of geometric 4D quantities, abstract tensors) are
compared with the experiments in [11]. It is found in [11] that the usual formulation [16] shows only an ”apparent”
agreement (not the true one) with the traditional and modern experiments that test SR, e.g., the Michelson-Morley
type experiments, the “muon” experiments, the Ives-Stilwell type experiments, etc., whereas the invariant SR from
[10] is in a complete agreement with all considered experiments. Similarly it is proved in [14] that the standard
transformations of the 3D E and B are also “apparent” transformations and that they signiﬁcantly diﬀer from the
correct LT of 4D quantities representing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The comparison with experiments on
motional electromotive force (emf) given in the second paper in [14] and also in [15] (the Faraday disk) shows that the
geometric approach with geometric 4D quantities, 4D AQs or equivalently with 4D CBGQs, and with the LT of the
4D quantities representing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds always agrees with experiments for all relatively moving
observers, whereas it is not the case for the usual approach with the 3D E and B and their standard transformations.
Indeed it is obtained in [15] that the standard formulation yields diﬀerent values for the emf of the Faraday disk for
relatively moving inertial observers, see the eqs. (55) and (58) in the ﬁrst paper in [15]. (For the description and the
picture of the Faraday disk see, e.g., [24] Chap. 18 or the ﬁrst paper in [25].) On the other hand in our geometric
approach the emf is deﬁned as a Lorentz scalar and consequently the same value for that emf is obtained for all
relatively moving inertial frames, see the eqs. (61-63) in the ﬁrst paper in [15].

It is worth noting that in these proofs, e.g., in the second paper in [14], we could equivalently use the bivector ﬁeld

F through the relation (4) instead of 1-vectors E and B, and similarly in [15].

In this paper we shall discuss the Trouton-Noble experiment [26], see also [27], comparing the usual explanations
with our geometric approach that explicitly uses AQs, the F ﬁeld. In the experiment they looked for the turning
motion of a charged parallel plate capacitor suspended at rest in the frame of the earth in order to measure the earth’s
motion through the ether. The explanations, which are given until now (see, e.g., [28-32] and references therein) for the
null result of the experiments [26] ([27]) are not correct from the invariant SR viewpoint, since they use quantities and
transformations that are not well-deﬁned in the 4D spacetime; e.g., the Lorentz contraction, the nonelectromagnetic
forces of undeﬁned nature, the standard transformations for the 3D vectors E and B and for the torque as the 3D
In all previous treatments it is correctly found that there is no torque for the stationary capacitor.
vector, etc..
However, the torque is obtained for the moving capacitor and then the above mentioned diﬀerent explanations are
oﬀered for the existence of another torque which is equal in magnitude but of opposite direction giving that the
total torque is zero. In our approach the explanation for the null result is very simple and natural; all quantities are
invariant 4D quantities, which means that their values are the same in the rest frame of the capacitor and in the
moving frame. Thus if there is no torque (but now as a geometric, invariant, 4D quantity) in the rest frame then the
capacitor cannot appear to be rotating in a uniformly moving frame.

Let us discuss the mentioned fundamental diﬀerence between the usual approaches and our geometric approach
considering some recent “explanations” of the Trouton-Noble paradox. First we examine the “explanation” for the
It is shown in [28] that no turning moment exists both in the rest frame of the
null result that is given in [28].
capacitor and in the moving frame. But such correct result is achieved introducing, together with the electromagnetic
forces, some nonelectromagnetic forces, the forces of constraint, whose physical nature is undeﬁned. Thus, when using
the energy arguments, the null result for the torque in the moving frame is obtained taking into account not only the
electromagnetic energy but, [28]: “a contribution of energy from the forces of constraint, due to work done by these
forces during a Lorentz contraction of the system.” There are several objections to such treatment [28] from the point
of view of the invariant SR and they refer in the same measure to all similar treatments given in, e.g., [29-31]. These
objections are the following:

i) The nonelectromagnetic forces and von Laue’s energy current [29] associated with them are not measurable
quantities, see also the discussion of the Poincar´e stresses and the electromagnetic energy-momentum in [33]. As
Aranoﬀ [34] stated in his severe criticism of von Laue’s explanation: ”The energy current idea of von Laue has to go
the way of phlogiston, and the ether. It is interesting how man has to invent very ﬁne ﬂuids which carry energy but
which are otherwise unobservable.”

16

ii) The Lorentz contraction is employed in all “explanations” [28-31] but, as shown in [10] and [11], see also [35],

the Lorentz contraction has nothing to do with the LT and moreover it cannot be measured.

iii) The standard transformations of the 3D E and B are considered, e.g., [25] and [28-32], to be the LT of these
ﬁelds. However it is rigorously proved in [14] that the standard transformations drastically diﬀer from the correct LT
of 4D quantities representing the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

iv) The transformations of the components of a 3D force and torque are commonly used in the mentioned “expla-
nations,” but the correct LT always refer to the 4D quantities. In the invariant SR the theoretical and experimental
meaning is attributed only to geometric 4D quantities and not to their parts. Diﬀerent relatively moving inertial 4D
observers can compare only 4D quantities since they are connected by the LT.

In the recent paper [32] it is argued that the Trouton-Noble paradox is resolved once the electromagnetic momentum
of the moving capacitor is properly taken into account. First it is obtained that there is a mechanical 3D torque on the
moving capacitor and then it is shown that the rate of change of the angular electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum associated
with the moving capacitor completely balances that mechanical torque. We want to show that the appearance of the
3D torque on the moving capacitor in [32] is a consequence of the above mentioned objection iv) and another one:

v) The use of the principle of relativity for physical laws that are expressed by 3D quantities.
It will be seen below that in the geometric approach with 4D quantities the torque will not appear for the moving
capacitor if it does not exist for the stationary capacitor. Thus, actually, the consideration with 4D quantities and
their LT will reveal that there is no need at all either for the nonelectromagnetic forces and their torque, [28-31], or for
the angular electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum and its rate of change, i.e., its torque, [32]. Therefore we shall examine
in more detail the calculation of the torque that is presented in [32], but not of the angular electromagnetic ﬁeld
momentum. In the rest frame of a thin parallel-plate capacitor, the S′ frame, there is no torque. Then it is assumed
in [32] that in the S frame the capacitor moves with uniform velocity V (the 3D vector) in the positive direction of
the x1 - axis. (Fig. 1. from [32] is actually a projection onto the hypersurface t′ = const., which means that x, y
and Θ from that Fig.1. would need to be denoted as x′1, x′2 and Θ′ respectively.) In the S′ frame A denotes the
surface area of the capacitor’s plates, a is the distance between the capacitor’s plates and Θ′ is the angle between the
line joining the axis of rotation (i.e., the middle of the negative plate) with the middle of the positive plate and the
x′2 axis. That line is taken to be in the x′1, x′2 plane (see Fig. 1. in [32]). The torque (the 3D vector) experienced
by the moving capacitor is determined by using “relativistic” (my quotation-marks) transformation equations for the
torque. These “relativistic” transformation equations for the 3D torque given in [32] are

N1 = N ′

capacitor, and r′
i are the components of the lever arm joining the axis of rotation with the point of application of
the resultant force, i.e., the midpoint of the positive plate, see Fig. 1. in [32]. (The equations (69) are the equations
(1)-(3) in [32].) As already said the 3D torque on the stationary capacitor is zero, N ′
cl.k = 0. (Note that
in this equation for N ′
i and in (69) we have used the same notation as in (3), i.e., the components of the 3D quantities
are written with lowered (generic) subscripts, since they are not the spatial components of the 4D quantities. This
refers to the third-rank antisymmetric ε tensor too.) Taking into account that N ′

(70)

This result is commented in [32] in the following way: “We have thus obtained a paradoxical result: contrary to the
relativity principle, although our stationary capacitor experiences no torque, the same capacitor moving with uniform
velocity along a straight line appears to experience a torque. What makes this result especially surprising is that we
have arrived at it by using relativistic transformations that are based on the very same relativity principle with which
they now appear to conﬂict.”

Let us examine the calculation leading to (69) and (70) and the above quoted statements. First N ′

i is deﬁned by
means of the 3D quantities. Then the transformation equations (69) for the components of the 3D torque are derived
considering that the transformations of the components of the 3D force are the LT. Since in S′ the capacitor is at rest
the mentioned transformations of the components of the 3D force are

Kcl.1 = K ′

cl.1, Kcl.2 = K ′

cl.2/γ, Kcl.3 = K ′

cl.3/γ.

(71)

It is assumed in [32], as in many other papers including [28-31], that the transformations (71) (and similarly for (69))
are the relativistic transformations, i.e., the LT, that are based on the principle of relativity. Such opinion implicitly
supposes that 3D quantities, their transformations and physical laws written in terms of them are physically real
in the 4D spacetime and in agreement with the principle of relativity. Actually such opinion prevails already from
Einstein’s fundamental work on SR [16].

17

(72)

The approach of the invariant SR [10-15] is completely diﬀerent. There, as already explained, the physical reality in
the 4D spacetime is attributed only to geometric 4D quantities, AQs or CBGQs, their LT and physical laws written in
terms of them. The principle of relativity is automatically included in such formulation. Thence in the 4D spacetime
we are dealing with the Lorentz force K = (q/c)F · u, where u is the velocity 1-vector of a charge q. The torque, as a
4D AQ, is deﬁned as the bivector

N = r ∧ K, r = xP − xO,

where r is 1-vector associated with the lever arm, xP and xO are the position 1-vectors associated with the spatial
point of the axis of rotation and the spatial point of application of the force K, P and O are the events whose position
1-vectors are xP and xO.

In general the proper velocity u for a point particle is u = dx/dτ , τ is the proper time, p is the proper momentum
p = mu, the proper angular momentum of a particle is the bivector L = x ∧ p and the torque N about the origin is the
bivector N = dL/dτ = x∧K, where in this relation K is an arbitrary force 1-vector. When K is written as a CBGQ in
the standard basis {γµ} then its components are K µ = (γuKcl.iVi/c, γuKcl.1, γuKcl.2, γuKcl.3), and the components of
u in the {γµ} basis are uµ = (γuc, γuV1, γuV2, γuV3). γu = (1 − V 2/c2)−1/2, Kcl.i are components of the 3D force and
Vi are components of the 3D velocity. We see that only when the considered particle is at rest, i.e., Vi = 0, γu = 1 and
consequently uµ = (c, 0, 0, 0), then K µ contains only the components Kcl.i, i.e., K µ = (0, Kcl.1, Kcl.2, Kcl.3). However
even in that case uµ and K µ are the components of geometric 4D quantities u and K in the {γµ} basis and not the
components of some 3D quantities V and Kcl.. The LT correctly transform the whole 4D quantity, which means that
there is no physical sense in such transformations like (71) and (69); these transformations are not relativistic and
they are not based on the principle of relativity. All conclusions derived from such relations as are (71) and (69) have
nothing in common with the special relativity as the theory of the 4D spacetime.

cl.3 = 0, which yields K ′µ = (0, K ′

When N (72) is written as a CBGQ in the standard basis {γµ} then it becomes N = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν, where
N αβ = γβ · (γα · N ) = xαK β − xβK α. Let us prove that N is zero, N = 0, in the rest frame of the capacitor, here the
S′ frame. In that frame we choose that r′0 = x′0
O = 0. The system of coordinates is chosen in such a way that
r′3 = 0 (as in Fig. 1. [32]) giving that r′µ = (0, r′
2, 0). Further, since in S′ we have stationary capacitor, Vi = 0,
γu = 1, and from the chosen system of coordinates we conclude that K ′
cl.2, 0).
Thence we ﬁnd that N ′i0 = N ′13 = N ′23 = 0 and only remains N ′12 = r′1K ′2 − r′2K ′1. Let us prove that N ′12 is also
zero. We shall use the result (37) obtained in Sec. IV.C. for F of a ﬂat sheet with the constant surface charge density
σ, then the chosen system of coordinates, i.e., Fig. 1. from [32], and the relation (4). Taking that in the relation (4)
0, i.e., that the S′ frame is the frame of “ﬁducial” observers,
the velocity v of the observers in the S′ frame is v = cγ′
we have that F ′i0 = E′i and all other F ′µν are zero. Then we can employ the discussion from Sec. 2. in [32]. In that
discussion the electric ﬁeld (as a 3D vector) and the 3D force K′
cl. are determined. The electric ﬁeld is produced by
the negative plate of the capacitor at the location of the positive plate. The 3D force K′
cl. acting on the positive plate
is along the line joining the axis of rotation (i.e., the middle of the negative plate) with the middle of the positive
1 + F ′20γ′
plate. All this together yields that F ′10 = (σ/2ε0) sin Θ′, F ′20 = −(σ/2ε0) cos Θ′ and K ′ = (σA)(F ′10γ′
2)
and also r′1 = −a sin Θ′, r′2 = a cos Θ′, where, as already said, A is the surface area of the capacitor’s plates and a is
the distance between the capacitor’s plates. Thence we ﬁnd that N ′12 = (σ2A/2ε0)a(sin Θ′ cos Θ′ − sin Θ′ cos Θ′) = 0.
Thus all N ′αβ are zero in the S′ frame in which the capacitor is at rest. Since the CBGQ (1/2)N ′µνγ′
ν is an
invariant quantity upon the passive LT we have proved not only that the components N ′αβ are zero but at the same
time that the whole torque N is zero

µ ∧ γ′

N = (1/2)N ′µνγ′

µ ∧ γ′

ν = (1/2)N µνγµ ∧ γν = 0.

Thence the torque is zero not only for the stationary capacitor but for the moving capacitor as well. We see that in
the approach with the geometric 4D quantities there is no Trouton-Noble paradox.

VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The aim of this work is to present an axiomatic, geometric approach to electromagnetism in which the primary
quantity is the electromagnetic ﬁeld F as an observer independent 4D quantity. The whole theory is deduced from
only one axiom: the ﬁeld equation for F (8). This formulation with the F ﬁeld is a self-contained, complete and
consistent formulation that does not make use either electric and magnetic ﬁelds or the electromagnetic potential A.
Such approach conceptually diﬀers from all previous approaches in several respects.

First, it places the electromagnetic ﬁeld F in the centre of the theoretical formulation and not, as usual, the 3D E

and B.

Second, the bivector ﬁeld F is considered to have an independent physical reality as a measurable 4D quantity, see

particularly the end of Sec. IV.D. and Sec. VII.

Third, the whole theory is manifestly Lorentz invariant ; it deals only with 4D AQs or 4D CBGQs and the space-time

split, i.e., the foliation of the spacetime, is not introduced anywhere.

Fourth, the connection with the usual picture that deals with electric and magnetic ﬁelds is given by the relations
(4) or (5). All quantities in these relations are 4D AQs in contrast to the common decompositions of F , e.g., from
[1-3], into observer dependent quantities EH, BH [1,2], or EJ , BJ [3]. Every relation with F can be transformed to
to the corresponding relation with electric and magnetic ﬁelds as 4D AQs using the mentioned equations (4) or (5);
see, for example, Sec. IV.B. in which the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a point charge is considered.

Fifth, many new results are obtained here, which are not yet presented in the literature. However even in the cases
when we used the results already presented in the literature, particularly in [1-3], these results are interpreted and
explained in such a way to be in agreement with our axiomatic formulation given in terms of 4D AQs or 4D CBGQs
and without any use of the space-time split. This diﬀers from all previous approaches, e.g., [1-3] and [7-9].

The observer independent expressions for the stress-energy vector T (n), the energy density U, the Poynting vector
S, the momentum density g, the angular-momentum density M and the Lorentz force K are derived from the ﬁeld
equation (8) and presented in Sec. IV. E. in this paper. Then the second quantization procedure, and the whole
quantum electrodynamics, can be constructed using these geometric, invariant, quantities F , T (n), U , S, g and M.
Note that the standard covariant approaches to quantum electrodynamics, e.g., [36], usually deal with the component
form (in the speciﬁc, i.e., the Einstein system of coordinates) of the electromagnetic 4-potential A (thus requiring
the gauge conditions too) and not with geometric quantities, AQs or CBGQs. The local conservation laws are also
directly derived from the ﬁeld equation (8) and written in an invariant way in Sec. IV. F. The observer independent
integral ﬁeld equation (35) corresponding to the ﬁeld equation (8) is quoted and discussed in Sec. IV. C. In Sec. V. we
have constructed 1-vector Lagrangian L (65), corresponding to the ﬁeld equation (8), with a speciﬁc feature that the
interaction term is written in terms of F and not, as usual, in terms of potential A. When that L (65) is written in the
standard basis {γµ} it becomes Sudbery’s Lagrangian [23]. Such form of the Lagrangian suggests that in the classical
electromagnetism, contrary to the generally accepted opinion, the interaction term can be expressed exclusively by
means of measurable quantities, either F , or electric and magnetic ﬁelds as 4D geometric quantities when, e.g., the
relations (4) or (24) are used. The consequences to the quantum mechanics will be examined elsewhere.

Particularly it has to be emphasized that the observer independent approach to the relativistic electrodynamics
that is presented in this paper is in a complete agreement with existing experiments that test special relativity, which
is not the case with the usual approaches. This is shown in detail in Sec. VII. for the Trouton-Noble experiment.

Furthermore we note that all observer independent quantities introduced here and the ﬁeld equations written in
terms of them hold in the same form both in the ﬂat and curved spacetimes. The formalism presented here will
be the basis for the formulation of quantum electrodynamics and, more generally, of the quantum ﬁeld theory that
exclusively deals with AQs or CBGQs.

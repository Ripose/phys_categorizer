Abstract. The problem of neutrino masses is discussed.
It is assumed that the electron
neutrino mass is related to the structures and masses of the W ± and Z 0 bosons. Using a
composite model of fermions (described by the author elsewhere), it is shown that the massless
neutrino is not consistent with the high values of the experimental masses of W ± and Z 0.
Consistency can be achieved on the assumption that the electron-neutrino has a mass of about
4.5 meV. Masses of the muon- and tau-neutrinos are also estimated.

1. Introduction

The results of recent observations of atmospheric and solar neutrinos aimed at testing the

hypothesis of the neutrino ﬂavour oscillations [1, 2]
Although a very small, but non-zero neutrino mass, can be a key to new physics underlying
the Standard Model of particle physics [3]. The Standard Model consider all three neutrinos
(νe, νµ, and ντ ) to be massless. Thus, observations show that the Standard Model needs some
corrections or extensions.

So far, many models have been proposed in order to explain possible mechanisms for the
neutrino mass generation [4]-[9], and many experiments have been carried out for measuring
this mass. The experiments with tritium β-decay gave controversial results: the neutrino mass
squared appears to be negative [10]-[12]. The current experimental constraints on the neutrino
masses recommended by the Particle Data Group [13]:

Astrophysical data [14] give stronger constraints:

Recently a new composite model of fermions has been proposed by the author [15], in which
the neutrino is described as a Majorana particle, almost massless in free states, but acquiring

an essential mass if bonded to a charged particle. Our model satisfactorily (to an accuracy of
10−6) reproduces masses of the fundamental fermions (quarks and charged leptons) but fails to
predict masses of neutral particles, such as neutrinos or photons, as well as of the weak gauge
bosons (Z 0 and W ±). Here we propose a possible solution of this problem by considering a
hypothetical symmetry between the fermion and boson mass structures.

2. Possible structure of W ±

Our model is based on the idea of compositeness of fermions, supposing that they are formed of
primitive entities with few properties (we refer to these entities as “preons”). The properties of
the preon are limited to its three-colour symmetry known as SU(3), symmetry of charges, U(1),
and mass. For simplicity, we use unit values for the preon mass and charge. Then masses of
the composite particles (fermions) can be calculated as sums of the masses of their constituents
(preons) if the composite particle is “rigid”. Otherwise, the following formulae

can be used for the “non-rigid” structures. Here M = P

masses, N is the number of components, and 1

of the composite system. Qualitatively, the particle is usually considered to be “rigid” if the
combined eﬀective potential of its constituents has a single minimum and “non-rigid” otherwise.
In our model, the ﬁrst family fermions appear to be rigid, while the fermions of the second and
third families are rather clusters of particles.

M ′ = P

Our model assumes a possibility of space inversion in the vicinity of the preon, with reciprocal
distances r and r′ = 1/r, measured from the preon’s centre. By deﬁnition, rr′ = 1. Assigning
also unit values to the local acceleration (a = 1) and to the universal gravitational constant
(G = 1), we obtain from (1) and (2) a simple formula for the fermion masses:

m = (

mi)(

1/mi)−1.

The masses in (3) are expressed in units of the preon’s mass (mΠ = 1; Π stands for the preon).
They can be converted into conventional units, say, proton mass units (mp), by calculating mp
with (3) and dividing all other calculated masses by this value. The calculated masses can be
also converted into MeV /c2 by using a conversion factor kΠ = 0.056777673 [MeV /Π] derived
from the experimental fermion masses [15].

We structure the electron-neutrino as a closed loop composed of twelve preon triplets, each
containing three preons of complementary colour charges. We denote this triplet with the
symbol Y, recalling its geometrical conﬁguration. The triplet has a mass of three preons,
mY = 3, and a charge qY = ±3 preon units. In this notation, the structure of the electron
neutrino can be written as νe = 6(YY). The charges and masses of the adjacent unlike-charged
constituents of the neutrino are supposed to be mutually almost cancelled. The structure of the
electron (positron) can be written as e− = 3Y (e+ = 3Y) with the resulting charge qe = ±9 and
mass me = 9 preon units (9 × kΠ = 0.511 MeV ). In our model, a neutral massless particle, if

“rigidly” coupled to a charged particle, restores its mass. The mass of such a combined system
will be equal to the sum of the masses of its components, and the charge will correspond to
the charge of its charged component. For instance, the mass of the system Y6(YY) is the sum
of mY = 3 and 36 unit masses of the preons constituing νe (mY6(YY) = 39 preon mass units).
Its charge (qY6(YY) = −3) corresponds to the charge of a single Y-particle. We associate the

chain (νeY)νe(Yνe) with the up-quark.
(+6) and its mass is the sum of two mY6(YY) (39 + 39 = 78 mass units or 78 × kΠ = 4.42
MeV ). The up-quark combined with the structure 3Y6(YY) = eνe reproduces the down-quark,
3Y6(YY)(νeY)νe(Yνe), with its charge of −9 + 3 + 3 = −3 units and a mass of 9 + 36 + 78 = 123
units (123 × kΠ = 6.98 MeV ).
The structure 3Y6(YY) = e−νe, which can be associated with the weak gauge boson, (see Table
2 in [15]) consists of 45 preons (9 preons of the electron and 36 preons of νe). It should have
a mass of about 2.6 MeV within the structure of the d-quark, or zero (in a free state). In
contrast, it is known that the experimental mass of the weak gauge boson is neither 2.6 MeV
nor zero, but about 80 GeV . This indicates that expression (3) is not applicable to bosons.
Even if one had taken mνe 6= 0, the mass of W ± would increase very little, still disagreeing with
experiment. We can resolve the problem by using a reciprocal formula

mi)−1(

for bosons, assuming symmetrical relationships between the boson and fermion mass structures.
The physical justiﬁcation for this assumption is not very strong: we suppose that the reciprocal
manifestations of space introduced in [15] are interchangeable for fermions and bosons. But
(4) reproduces the large W ± and Z 0 masses. Actually, had the neutrino mass be taken zero,
the masses of W ± and Z 0 would become inﬁnite. Using mνe 6= 0 in (4), one can calculate a
verisimilar mass for the weak gauge boson, and the following electron-neutrino mass

mνe = (4.453 ± 0.002) · 10−3

[eV ]

corresponds to the experimental ﬁt of mW = 80.43 ± 0.04 GeV [13], with the tolerance interval
translated from mW to mνe.

3. The neutrinos νµ and ντ

In our model, the muon- and tau-neutrinos are hypothetically formed by consecutive additions
of the unlike-charged pairs νeY and νeY to the electron-neutrino. The muon-neutrino would
have one such pair in its structure:

νµ = (νeY)νe(Yνe),

and the tau-neutrino has two such pairs:

ντ = (νeY)νe(νeY)νe(Yνe)νe(Yνe).

Both νµ and ντ are parts of the tau-lepton, forming two components, µνµ and ντ :

The clustered components of this structure are embraced in parenthesis and marked with the
boxed numbers. The number of preons (mass) of the ﬁrst component is

n1 = m1 = nµ + nνµ = nW + nνµ + nνµ = 45 + 78 + 78 = 201.

Using this value in (4) and taking into account the known experimental value for the muon
mass

(m2 = 31297.33 in preon mass units), one can translate mexp

into the mass of ντ :

mντ = (9.0253+0.0018

As for the muon-neutrino, it is more diﬃcult to estimate its mass because there are no particles
containing νµ as a separate component within their structures. For example, the muon can be
structured as:

(see [15] for details), which includes νµ. But here it is shared between two components,
and 2 , having its own substructure. Using the known experimental value for the muon mass:
mexp
µ = 105.658 [MeV ] (1860.9168 preon mass units), we can do as much as to evaluate the
upper limit for the muon-neutrino mass (mνµ ≤ 0.68 eV ). But it should be more logical
to suppose that mνµ lies somewhere between the masses of the electron- and tau-neutrinos
(mνe = 4.4 meV and mντ = 9.0 meV ), that is
mνµ ≈ 6 · 10−3 [eV ].

4. Structure of Z 0

The Z 0-boson is a photon-like particle with high mass. It is quite possible that its structure
resembles that of W ±. We suppose Z 0 to be composed of W + and W −:

Z 0 =

(6)

At a ﬁrst glance, the component e+e− of this structure, (a neutral particle), should be massless.
But in this case, the mass of Z 0 increases inﬁnitely. Since the known experimental mass of Z 0
is ﬁnite (mZ = 91.1876 ± 0.0021GeV [13]), the mass of e+e− is:

me+e− = 0.90140 ± 0.00004 [MeV ],

in accordance with (4), (5) and (6), which means that the electron and positron wave functions
in e−e+ are not overlapped. Of course, the e+e−-particle can exist only for a very short period
of time or at very low temperatures. Normally, the electron (3Y) and its antiparticle (3Y) will
decay into three structures YY (three photons).

5. Conclusions

The hypothetical symmetry between bosons and fermions in our model suggests a method
for estimation of the neutrino masses. Our estimations agree with experiments but, being
obtained for the neutrinos interacting with other particles (W ± and τ ), they should probably
be considered as upper limits for the neutrino masses.

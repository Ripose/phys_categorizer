A Proposed New Test of General Relativity and a Possible Solution to the
Cosmological Constant Problem

Following a conjecture of Feynman, we explore the possibility that only those energy forms that are
associated with (massive or massless) particles couple to the gravitational ﬁeld, but not others. We
propose an experiment to deﬂect electrons by a small charged sphere to determine if the standard
general relativity or this modiﬁed one corresponds to reality. The outcome of this experiment may
also solve the cosmological constant problem.

The equivalence of mass and energy, expressed in his celebrated formula E = mc2, led Einstein to postulate that

the energy-momentum tensor T µν in the ﬁeld equation of general relativity [1]

Rµν

gµνR =

(1)

contains all kinds of energies, such as matter, radiation, electromagnetic, vacuum, etc. Thus assuming that the
vacuum energy is negligible, the ﬁeld equation (1) outside an object of total mass M and static electric charge Q
containg no neutral and charged masses or other ﬁelds around it reduces to

Rµν =

8πG
c4 T µν
EM ,
where T µν
EM is the traceless energy-momentum tensor of the electric ﬁeld due to the charge Q of the object. For
the purpose of this letter we shall classify diﬀerent energy types into two. The ﬁrst class is the set of energy types
with which massive or massless particles are associated. Thus the energy of an already existing mass distribution
is obviously of this class 1 . Since the energy in an electromagnetic wave (electromagnetic radiation) is carried in
packages that behave like massless particles (photons) the electromagnetic radiation energy is also of this class 2 .
Energies associated with other massless particles like neutrinos and gravitons are further examples. Each energy type
in this class may rightly be called ‘mass energy’ or ‘particle energy’. The second class is the set of energy types with
which no particles are associated 3 . The energies in the electric ﬁelds of a static charge distribution and between the
plates of a capacitor as well as the vacuum energy are of the second class.

(2)

There is plenty of emprical proof, such as the successes of the big-bang cosmology and the deﬂection of light by the
sun, that the ﬁrst class energies couple to the gravitational ﬁeld. But there does not exist any emprical proof at present
for the coupling of the second class energies to the gravitational ﬁeld. Therefore, we do not know with certainty if Eq.
(2) corresponds to a fact of nature. It lacks experimental support. There is the intriguing possibility that we shall
consider in this letter, as ﬁrst hinted by Feynman [2] when he said ’...Now gravity is supposed to interact with every
form of energy and should interact then with this vacuum energy. And therefore, so to speak, a vacuum would have
a weight-an equivalent mass energy-and would produce a gravitational ﬁeld. Well, it doesn’t! The gravitational ﬁeld
produced by the energy in the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a vacuum-where there’s no light, just quiet, nothing-should be

1The mass of the distribution may be constantly changing due to its mechanical energy, its absorbtion or loss of heat energy,
etc. Furthermore, while we can estimate how much electromagnetic binding energy of an atom contributes to its rest mass
we do not know, for example, how much weak and gravitational energies contribute to it. We also know from the E¨otv¨os
experiment that electromagnetic binding energy contributes equally to inertial and gravitational massess. We assume this is
the case for the other energy types.
2Recall that though massless, an ‘eﬀective mass’ can be assigned to photons.
3Of course, there is an ‘equivalent mass’ through E = mc2 for such energies too. But the crucial point is that there is no
already existing massive or massless particles associated with them.

enermous, so enermous, it would be obvious. The fact is, it’s zero! Or so small that it’s completely in disagreement
with what we’d expect from the ﬁeld theory. This problem is sometimes called the cosmological constant problem. It
suggests that we’re missing something in our formulation of the theory of gravity. It’s even possible that the cause
of the trouble-the inﬁnities-arises from the gravity interacting with its own energy in a vacuum. And we started oﬀ
wrong because we already know there’s something wrong with the idea that gravity should interact with the energy of
a vacuum. So I think the ﬁrst thing we should understand is how to formulate gravity so that it doesn’t interact with
the energy in a vacuum...’ According to this conjecture of Feynman there is the possibility that the right side of Eq.
(2) may be zero:

Rµν = 0.

The importance of confronting with experiment the predictions of equations (2) and (3) is not merely academic. If
it turns out that Eq. (3) is the one favored by nature, we then have a very simple solution [2] to the cosmological
constant problem [3].
It would mean that being of the second class, the vacuum energy does not couple to the
gravitational ﬁeld. The present value of the vacuum energy density is as large as it had been in the early universe.
The cosmological constant, however, is simply zero, as it has always been.

The purpose of this letter is to propose a deﬂection of electrons by a positively charged sphere experiment to
distinguish between equations (2) and (3). To this end, we shall need the solutions of these equations. The solution
of Eq. (2) for a static and spherical distribution of mass M and electric charge Q located at r = 0 is known as the
Reissner-Nordstrøm solution [4,5]. It is given by

4Eq. (6) can also be obtained intuitively by classical energy considerations. Consider an electron moving radially away from
a sphere of mass M and charge Q. For the electron to escape from this object at a distance r from its center and reach inﬁnity
with zero speed, the escape velocity vesc satisﬁes mv2
esc/2 − GmM/r − ekeQ/r = 0. Replacing vesc with c, the speed of light,
(so that the electron cannot escape from the surface of radius r) and dividing it by mc2/2 the left side of this equation becomes
(1 − 2GM/c2r − 2ekeQ/mc2r), which is the g00 in Eq. (6) .

we indulge in obtaining the orbit equations in experimentally relevant form, we propose the following experiment.
Consider a rectangular vacuum chamber. Let a small metallic sphere of radius R
5 cm positively charged to a
voltage V (R) = keQ/R be hanged freely from an insulating thread. Let an electron gun be located at a distance d
away from the equator (the θ = π/2 plane) of the sphere with an impact parameter b which is the horizontal distance
between the initial path of the ejected electron beam and the center of the sphere. Thus the initial position of the
beam is (xi, yi) = (
b, d) at an angle φi = π/2 + arctan(b/d). Put a calibrated ﬂuorescent screen on the negative y
axis at φ = 3π/2. The initial conditions for solving the diﬀerential equations that we shall obtain (see equations (15)

and (16) ) are u(φi) = r

5Note that charged particles follow the geodesics, Eq. (8), of the metric gµν. This is a consequence of Eq. (3). Note also
that there is a diﬀerent metric for each particle with a diﬀerent charge-to-mass ratio. The resulting theory, therefore, is a
multi-metric theory.

which is the orbit equation in our case which we call modiﬁed general relativity. By using the initial conditions stated
above these equations can be solved numerically for r = 1/u, the predicted position of the electron beam on the screen
from the center of the sphere. By comparing the experimental value with these predictions, the correct theory can
be determined. In Figures 1 and 2 we depict the trajectory of the electrons according to the two theories. It is seen
that the diﬀerence between the two predictions is large enough. Hence the experimentally favored one can be picked
up rather easily.

Before we conclude, we wish to clarify the implications of the E¨otv¨os experiment in regard to the theory presented
here. The electromagnetic energy of the atoms, or any other form of energy, in an object has already been converted to
mass ( and thus belongs to the ﬁrst type in our classiﬁcation of the energy types above). What the E¨otv¨os experiment
tells us is that the electromagnetic energy contributes in equal amounts to gravitational and inertial masses. It does
not tell us that this energy couples to the gravitational ﬁeld independently as energy. Had the electromagnetic energy
coupled to the gravitational ﬁeld independently, a deﬂection in the balance of the E¨otv¨os apparatus would have been
seen when two equal massess having considerably diﬀerent electromagnetic binding energies were used. Of course this
does not happen.

In conclusion, we have explored the conjecture of Feynman on a reformulation of general relativity. In this new
scheme only the ‘mass energy’ couples to the gravitational ﬁeld, but not other energy forms. We have proposed a
deﬂection of electrons by a charged sphere experiment. The signiﬁcance of this experiment is that it not only provides
a new test of general relativity but also may point out to the solution of the cosmological constant problem. Not being
a wave, the energy of the vacuum is not associated with quantized packages and a formula like E
f , with f being
f /c2 cannot be deﬁned. Thus according to the scheme
the frequency, cannot be written and an eﬀective mass mef f
presented here the ﬁeld equation for vacuum is Rµν = 0, implying that the cosmological constant λ = (8πG/c4)ρV of
standard general relativity, with ρV being the vacuum energy density, is λ = 0
ρV = 0 here. λ has always been equal
to zero! Keeping on mind that (i) standard general relativity remains one of the least tested of scientiﬁc theories,
and (ii) the theory presented here oﬀers a very simple solution to the cosmological constant problem, the immediate
performance of the experiment suggested here cannot be overemphasized.

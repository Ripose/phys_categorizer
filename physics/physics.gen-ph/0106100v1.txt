Fluctuations in the Quantum Vacuum

Abstract

We argue that it is a ﬂuctuational underpinning of the Quantum
vacuum which on the one hand gives a stochastic character to the
conservation laws, and on the other is required for explaining the
recently observed acceleration of the universe. This also provides us
with the arrow of time, in a consistent cosmology.

1 Introduction

Classical Physics is based on a deterministic spacetime. It is also true that the
equations of Classical Physics are time reversible. The equations of Quantum
Mechanics too are time reversible, though here it is the probabilities which
are determinable. Irreversible processes are phenomenological, according to
this thinking. That is irreversibility arises due to the role of the observer.
One important diﬀerence which is brought about by Quantum Theory is that
the smaller the spacetime intervals we consider, the greater the Uncertainity
in the energies and momenta wherein the Uncertainity in energy results in
the creation and destruction of particles. As Feynman put it[1], ”created and
annihilated, created and annihilated - what a waste of time”. The Quatum
vacuum is thus an arena of frenzied activity at the micro scale. Nevertheless,
conservation of energy is respected. Particles may appear to be created, but
this energy is returned to the Quantum vacuum within the Uncertainity time
interval. There are wild incessant ﬂuctuations in energy, but these miracu-
lously cancel out on the average. Energy is conserved on the average.
However all of this still respects a smooth spacetime manifold, what Witten
has termed ”Bosonic spacetime”[2].

2 Non Commutative Spacetime

Latest studies for example Quantum SuperString Theory or the author’s
stochastic non commutative spacetime, take us beyond the above approxi-
mate description to what Witten calls Fermionic spacetime[2, 3, 4, 5]. In this
case two spacetime coordinates like x and y do not commute but rather we
have the equation

and similar equations, where l deﬁnes the Compton scale.
Another way of looking at (1) is that the usual Uncertainity Principle is
modiﬁed:

[x, y]

0(l2)

≈

∆x

·

∆p
l2

h′

∼

¯h + h′,
(∆p)2
h

∼

·

∆p

∼

hR
l2

√Nmc2

∆E

∼

2

This is an expression of the well known duality[2, 6], which provides an
interface between the micro world and the macro universe. Infact h′ deﬁnes
this interface. We can now show that h′ results in a non conservation of
energy. Infact from (2) we have

where R = ∆x is the radius of the universe.
We have an equation for energy similar to (3) also. Using the well known
1080 is the number of particles in
Eddington formula, R
∼
the universe, (3) becomes

√N l, where N

∼

∼
and the similar equation for energy is

∆p

√N mc

An interpretation of (4) follows naturally from the model of ﬂuctuational
cosmology[7, 8]. Here the √N particles are created ﬂuctuationally out of the
Quantum vacuum, and equation (4) gives the energy of these particles. It
must be emphasized that the above cosmological model provides an expla-
nation for the otherwise miraculous large number coincidences, apart from

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

predicting an ever expanding, accelerating universe, as indeed the latest ob-
servations conﬁrm.
It must also be emphasized that in the above model the particles are cre-
ated unidirectionally, that is there is no destruction of particles.
It is in
this sense that the above model goes beyond the conventional conservation
laws, as symbolised by the extra Uncertainity term h′ in equation (2). Infact
as argued elsewhere[9], the conservation laws themselves are not iron clad,
but are stochastic in nature. There is a certain resemblance of this model to
Dirac’s large number cosmology[10], wherein also particles are created. How-
ever this latter model has some inconsistencies. What is interesting is that
Dirac, on the one hand brilliantly hypothesized that the large number rela-
tions like the Eddington formula referred to earlier were not mere accidents,
but rather were symptomatic of a profound underlying principle. On the
other hand, Dirac himself vacillated inconclusively between two versions of
his cosmology, one in which energy was not conserved and another in which
energy was conserved[11].
In any case we have here a resolution to the so called time paradox, that
is manifest irreversibility within the framework of reversible equations as al-
luded to at the beginning[12]. In the words of Prigogine (loc.cit)”As is well
known, Albert Einstein often asserted, ”Time is an illusion.” Indeed time, as
described by the basic laws of physics, from classical Newtonian dynamics
to relativity and quantum physics, does not include any distinction between
past and future. Even today, for many physicists it is a matter of faith that
as far as the fundamental description of nature is concerned, there is no ar-
row of time.
”Yet everywhere-in chemistry, geology, cosmology, biology, and the human
sciences-past and future play diﬀerent roles. How can the arrow of time
emerge from what physics describes as a time-symmetrical world? This is
the time paradox...”
Infact the time of conventional physics, as argued elsewhere[6, 13] is an ap-
proximate time, an approximation that fudges the above ﬂuctuations. Such a
time is what may be called a stationary time, or time without time in phrase-
ology a la Wheeler. This is also the stationary time of Quantum Mechanics
in which the three space coordinates and time are on the same footing as
in Special Relativity, and the displacement operators represent the energy-
momenta[14]. It is the ﬂuctuational creation of particles which gives rise to
irreversibility, and infact time itself (Cf.[15]. It is the age old divide between

3

being and becoming.
Another way of looking at this is, that in the above ﬂuctuational cosmological
scheme, we have the analogue of the Eddington formula for time, viz.,

√N τ,

T

≈

where T is the age of the universe and τ the Compton time. Not only is this
relation correct, but it also provides the arrow of time.
We would also like to remark that the vacuum energy, as given in (4) is, ac-
cording to latest observations, required to explain the cosmological constant
and that is, to explain the acceleration of the universe.

3 Fluctuational Cosmology

We now brieﬂy describe the cosmological model referred to in Section 2[7].
Dirac’s Large Number Hypothesis (LNH) has been much written about, ever
since he spelt it out[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. As is well known this
is based on apparently mysterious ratios of certain physical constants which
coincide or show a relationship. Let us start with,

where m is the pion mass, the pion being a typical elementary particle, this
being the ratio of the electromagnetic and gravitational forces, and

where T is the age of the universe and l the pion Compton wavelength.
In this light, the LNH can be stated as (cf.[22]).
”Any two of the very large dimensionless numbers occuring in nature are
connected by a simple mathematical relation, in which the coeﬃcients are of
the order of magnitude unity”
An application of this to (5) and (6) means that their equality is not acci-
dental but rather leads immediately to, Dirac’s well known relation,

N1 =

e2
Gm2 ≈

1040

N2 =

cT
l ≈

1040

G α T −1

(5)

(6)

(7)

Dirac’s approach further leads to

which appears to be inconsistent[18, 25].
Another ”accidental” relation is,

R α T 1/3

2
H
¯h
Gc

(

)1/3

m

≈

ρ α T −1

α T −2

∧

As observed by Weinberg (7), this is in a diﬀerent category and is unex-
plained: it relates a single cosmological parameter H to constants from mi-
crophysics.
In the spirit of LNH, one could also deduce that[23],

and

∧

is the cosmological con-

where ρ is the average density of the universe and
stant.
It may be mentioned that attempts to generalise or modify the LNH have
been made (cf.eg.[25, 26]) but without gaining much further insight.
We now deduce equations (7), (9), (10) and (11) from an alternative stand-
point. Moreover in place of the troublesome equation (9), we will get a con-
sistent equation. Our starting point is the Zero Point Field (ZPF). According
to QFT, this ﬁeld is secondary, while according to Stochastic Electrodynam-
ics (SED), this ﬁeld is primary.
We observe that the ZPF leads to divergences in QFT[27] if no large frequency
cut oﬀ is arbitrarily prescribed, e.g. the Compton wavelength. On the con-
trary, we argue that it is these ﬂuctuations within the Compton wavelength
¯h/mc2, which create the particles. Thus choosing
and in time intervals
the pion again as a typical particle, we get[27, 28]

∼

(Energy density of ZPF)Xl3 = mc2

Further as there are N

1080 such particles in the Universe, we get,

∼

Nm = M

5

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

where M is the mass of the universe.
In the following we will use N as the sole cosmological parameter.
Equating the gravitational potential energy of the pion in a three dimensional
isotropic sphere of pions of radius R, the radius of the universe, with the rest
energy of the pion, we can deduce the well known relation

where M can be obtained from (13).
We now use the fact that the ﬂuctuation in the particle number is of the order
¯h/mc2
√N[29, 30, 8], while a typical time interval for the ﬂuctuations is
as seen above. (That is particles induce more particles by ﬂuctuations). This
leads to the relation[28]

∼

¯h
mc2
where T is the age of the universe, and

T =

√N

while from (16), we get the cosmological constant as,

where H in (16) can be identiﬁed with the Hubble Constant, and is given by,

Equation (14) and (15) show that in this formulation, the correct radius and
age of the universe can be deduced given N as the sole cosmological or large
scale parameter. Equation (17)for
is consistent and exactly agrees with an
upper limit deduced for it[31]. Equation (18) is identical to equation (9).
In other words, equation (9) is no longer a mysterious coincidence but rather
a consequence.
√N (due to the ZPF) leads
To proceed we observe that the ﬂuctuation of
to the empirically well known and apparently mysterious relation (5) [28, 29],
with N1 = √N, whence we get,

If we combine (19) and (14), we get,

Gm
lc2 =

1
√N

If we combine (20) and (15), we get Dirac’s original equation (7). It must
be mentioned that, as argued by Dirac (cf.also ref.[32]) we treat G as the
variable, rather than the quantities m, l, cand¯h (which we will call micro
physical constants) because of their central role in atomic (and sub atomic)
physics.
Further, using (20) in (5), with N1 = √N , as pointed out before (19), we
can see that the charge e also is independant of time or N. So e also must
be added to the list of microphysical constants.
Next if we use G from (20) in (18), we can see that

H =

c
l

√N ≈

Gm3
πc
¯h

Thus apart from the fact that H has the same inverse time dependance on
T as G, (21) shows that given the microphysical constants, and N, we can
deduce the Hubble Constant also, as from (18).
Use of (17) in (21) now gives equation (11).
Using (13) and (19), we can now deduce that

Equation 22) gives the equation (10).
Next (19) and (15) give,

The equation (23) diﬀers from the troublesome Dirac dependence (8).
Finally, we observe that using M, GandH from the above, we get

a relation which is required in the Friedman model of the expanding universe
(and the Steady State model also (cf.refs.[24] and [25])).
We ﬁnally make four comments:

R = cT

M =

Firstly, in our model of particle production through ﬂuctuations of the ZPF,
the equation (15) actually provides an arrow of time, atleast at the cosmo-
logical scale, in terms of the particle number N.
Secondly, in the spirit of the uniform cosmic dust approximation, the newly
created particles are uniformly spread out.
In practice, as the number of
the ﬂuctuationally created particles is proportional to the square root of the
particles already present, more of the new particles are created, for example
near Galactic centres, than in empty voids, reminiscent of the jets which are
observed.
Thirdly, the reason why the Compton wavelength emerges as a fundamental
length has been seen in previous communications[28, 8, 33].
Finally, in this model, while the mass of the universe increases as NorT 2, the
volume increases as T 3 so that the mean density decreases as T −1 (equation
(22)), unlike in the steady state cosmology.

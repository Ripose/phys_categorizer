We studied the formation of omplex patterns using a variational priniple and a standard energy

funtional. These patterns evolve by letting the system to searh for the optimal on(cid:28)guration of

a high ondutivity hannel, that in one dimension is equivalent to tip e(cid:27)et evolution (evolution

towards regions of high eletri (cid:28)eld).

The similarities between omplex patterns produed spontaneously in dieletri

breakdown[1, 2, 3℄, snowrystals[4, 5, 6℄, visous (cid:28)ngers[7, 8℄, et., is suggestive for the

existene of an universal explanation for their appearane, the lak of a general model that

explains the appearane of these patterns and the apparent di(cid:30)ulty of this sub jet, leads

to the ommon belief that no simple general priniple an explain this diversity of omplex

patterns.

Some years ago we started the searh for an universal energy funtional from whih

omplex patterns should appear. After simplifying the typial dynamial equations for

several systems, elimination of mirosopi details, and negleting time dependent variables,

we were left with a simple Laplae equation[9℄.

The most general form of Laplae equation inludes a ondutivity that depends on spatial

oordinates, it turns out that in our model this ondutivity will have di(cid:27)erent values inside

the pattern and in the region outside the pattern. Laplae equation is a good starting point,

beause this equation is a onsequene of a onservation law for the (cid:29)ux of the vetorial

(cid:28)eld. It is well known that Laplae equation an be obtained from a variational priniple,

and the energy funtional an be found in any textbook of eletromagnetism. We found

that this energy funtional an produe a great variety of omplex patterns, when used in a

quasi-stati model that let the system to probe di(cid:27)erent on(cid:28)gurations for the ondutivity

and evolve towards the one where the energy funtional is maximized.

In this work we studied harged apaitors that are in a stati on(cid:28)guration for the salar

(cid:28)eld, but not in a state of minimal energy. For high voltages, the dieletri is able to inrease

loally the permittivity and a onduting hannel an be formed between boundaries. This

would allow the system to equalize the values for the salar (cid:28)eld at the boundaries, releasing

the stored energy. Tip e(cid:27)et and sreening are essential e(cid:27)ets in the study of these systems,

we understand our model as a generalization of tip e(cid:27)et evolution: instead of evolving the

hannel towards the regions of high eletri (cid:28)eld, we evolve the hannel towards regions

that maximize the energy funtional. Tip e(cid:27)et evolution and our model are equivalent

for one-dimensional systems, but for higher dimensions our model an produe omplex

patterns. Other models that use tip e(cid:27)et, must inlude an independent mehanism to pro-

due omplex patterns. Using a diret implementation of our model and di(cid:27)erent numerial

algorithms, we have obtained non-trivial results for dieletri breakdown patterns.

To understand the underlying physis, we explain the model using an eletri salar

(cid:28)eld φ inside a parallel plate apaitor: After imposing boundary onditions and given the

permittivity ǫ, whih in general depends on oordinates, one must solve Laplae equation

to obtain φ in the region of interest. It is well known that this equation an be derived,

using a variational priniple, from the energy funtional

∇ · (ǫ∇φ) = 0,

U =

ǫ(∇φ)dV.

U is also the total energy in the apaitor when the harge Q is maintained onstant.

In the ase of a parallel plate apaitor this energy will be proportional to d/ǫ, where d

is the separation between the plates. Stati physial systems evolve trying to redue the

total energy, this implies a fore between the plates trying to redue the distane d, and

if you insert a slab of a dieletri material having a permittivity ǫ' greater than ǫ, the

slab will be pulled into the apaitor. If instead of maintaining Q onstant, the potential

di(cid:27)erene between the plates V is maintained onstant, the energy U for this system will

be proportional to ǫ/d. In experiments at onstant Q or V there are fores trying to redue

d and to inrease ǫ, then in experiments at onstant V , U is not the total energy of the

system, beause the system evolves trying to inrease U . There is a missing energy term

oming from a rearrangement of harges in the wires to maintain V onstant. When this

term is introdued, the total energy is again proportional to d/ǫ. The previous disussion

justi(cid:28)es that we study systems at onstant V by letting them to evolve towards regions of

higher U .

If V is large enough the dieletri material will break ausing a short iruit, we propose

that for large V there is a new possibility for the system to lower the total energy, a short

iruit. Assuming that ǫ an evolve loally towards bigger values, forming a disharge

hannel, we ould obtain omplex patterns of permittivity by letting the system to evolve

towards higher values of U. Our model is quasi-stati (see below), but there are two impliit

time sales in the problem: a slow evolution for a loal hange in ǫ, and a fast evolution for

the eletri potential φ after a loal hange in ǫ. For these systems, omplex patterns are

produed beause the system is trying to lower the total energy by inreasing loally the

permittivity.

3

Beause the evolution for these systems is highly nonlinear, we have to rely on numerial

methods to study the growing of patterns. We study these systems using a quasi-stati

treatment as follows: First, set the boundary onditions whih are maintained trough all

the steps in our simulation. Seond, assign a (cid:28)xed value ǫ to the permittivity inside the

boundaries. Third, using Laplae equation, obtain φ after hanging the permittivity loally
to a greater value ǫ′

, near one eletrode. Fourth, (cid:28)nd the energy U using the new values

for the permittivity and the salar (cid:28)eld. Fifth, repeat steps 3 and 4 to obtain the energy

values U for eah of the neighbors of one eletrode. These energies are ompared and the

neighbor providing the biggest energy value is added to the hannel. These steps are repeated

inluding the new neighbors for the hannel, until a pattern develops. We used a square

lattie, pattern evolution through the diagonals is not permitted, and the pattern grows

adding only one site to the evolving pattern at eah time step.

The lightning disharge in thunderstorms[1℄ and sparks between harged ondutors,

evolve forming a branhed struture that resembles a fratal[10℄. The presently aepted

model of lightning[2, 3℄ was developed by Niemeyer, Pietronero and Wiesmann in 1984. They

inlude a stohasti term that weights a probability, that is a funtion of the value of the

loal eletri (cid:28)eld. This is known as the Dieletri Breakdown Model (DBM) and produes

a branhed struture whose fratal dimension is similar to the ones obtained experimentally

for the same geometry, Pietronero model is based on the Di(cid:27)usion Limited Aggregation

(DLA) model, developed by Witten and Sander in 1981[11℄.

Our results show that it is possible to obtain a branhed struture of lightning that

follow from a deterministi treatment[12℄, that only relies in minimizing the total energy

in the system and loal hanges in the permittivity of the medium (not the geometry of

the inner eletrode) at eah step of iteration. We note that our model is almost all of the

time deterministi, but for some on(cid:28)gurations there is degeneray for the extreme value of

the energy U , and the numerial noise will be responsible for seleting the next step in the

evolution of our simulated patterns.

We studied dieletri breakdown in the irular geometry of Fig. 1, onsidering a 20 × 20

two-dimensional square lattie, where the entral point is the inner eletrode and the outer

eletrode is modeled as a irle. The boundary onditions, φ = 0 in the inner eletrode

and φ = 1 in the outer eletrode, are maintained trough all the steps in our simulation.

For eah di(cid:27)erent on(cid:28)guration, the numerial solution of Laplae equation was obtained

4

using a Suessive Over Relaxation algorithm and aepted when the numerial residual

was less than 10−2
, the values for the permittivity outside the hannel was ǫ = 1 and inside
the hannel was ǫ′ = 5. The (cid:28)lled boxes represent the disharge hannel (sites where the
permittivity is ǫ′

). The irles show all possible sites where the hannel an evolve, the

diameter of eah of these irles represent the value for the energy U of the system if this

site is added to the hannel.

Beause upward-moving disharges initiated from earth attah with the downward-

moving leader in real lightning, we onsidered two initial branhes: the main branh oming

from the entral lattie site and the return branh oming from the outer eletrode. The

return branh begin to evolve, after 36 steps of evolution of the main branh, at the site

having the blak box inside (at the extreme left of the (cid:28)gure). The site between this point

and the main branh is the next step in the evolution, ompleting the path for this disharge

hannel from the inner eletrode towards the outer eletrode. The return branh obtained

in our numerial simulations is a highly non trivial result and we do not know of any other

work that an obtain this attahment.

Fig. 2 shows the struture of the pattern evolved from the entral lattie site for a

70 × 70 square lattie after 750 iterations. For eah di(cid:27)erent on(cid:28)guration, the numerial

solution of Eq. 1 was obtained using a Suessive Over Relaxation algorithm and aepted

when the numerial residual was less than 10−1
hannel was ǫ = 2 and inside the hannel was ǫ′ = 6. The evolution of the pattern shows that

, the values for the permittivity outside the

opposite branhes are not exatly aligned, it is possible to (cid:28)nd this e(cid:27)et in the experimental

results for snowrystal growth shown in Fig. 3 of ref [4℄. Our example also shows that the

system develops forming initially a entral ompat ore, this ore supports the evolution

of the main venous branhes and diagonal branhes. We expet that seondary branhes,

emerging from the main branhes, would appear after some additional iterations. Beause

we are using a diret implementation of the priniple of least ation, that is niely explained

in the textbook of Rihard Feynman[13℄, we solve Laplae equation for a permittivity hange

of eah neighbor, assigning permanently the value ǫ′

only to the neighbor with biggest U.

This proedure is very time onsuming and several months of omputing time was needed

for ompleting this example.

To redue the omputing time needed for obtaining patterns, we have re-implemented

our model using adaptive grid algorithms[14℄. We used two grids to study the evolution

restrition of solving Laplae equation in retangular domains. We fored the irular ge-

to very high values (ǫ = 1000), when x2 + y2 ≥ 1 and the following boundary onditions:

Figure 3: Energy U as a funtion of neighbor position for a diagonal of length 70 starting at (0,0),

in a setor of a irular domain as shown in the inset. The alulation was done in a 100 × 100

square lattie, using 20000 nodes for the adaptive grid, ǫ = 1, and ǫ′ = 3.

inreases, this alulation begins to slow down.

To gain some insight, we have arried out alulations of the energies U for the neighbors

of a given (cid:28)xed pattern. We fored a one-dimensional line of permittivity ǫ′

and length

70 along the diagonal, starting at (0,0), as shown in the inset of (cid:28)gure 3.

In this (cid:28)gure

we plot the energies U obtained after a loal hange of eah neighbor permittivity towards

, neighbors near position 1 orrespond to the line left lowest neighbors, neighbors near

position 70 orrespond to the line tip neighbors, and neighbors near position 140 orrespond

to the line right lowest neighbors. In this plot we (cid:28)tted 7th grade polynomials for the left

and right branhes. Beause the system evolves towards high values of U, this line would

evolve towards the lowest neighbors and not towards the tip neighbors. This evolution is

8

ontrary to tip e(cid:27)et evolution and is a onsequene of the (cid:28)nite value ǫ′

and geometry.

To investigate the e(cid:27)et of geometry, we studied the evolution of a pattern starting from

the entral site of the bottom boundary in a unit square domain and the following boundary

onditions: φ = 1 at the top, φ = 0 at the bottom, φ = y at the left boundary, and φ = y

at the right boundary. Using a 100 × 100 square lattie to evolve the pattern, 20000 nodes
for the adaptive grid, ǫ = 1, and ǫ′ = 20, the pattern grows as a vertial one-dimensional

line. This is exatly what is expeted from tip e(cid:27)et evolution and shows that the numerial

error is well ontrolled in our simulations.

To show the di(cid:27)erenes between our model and tip e(cid:27)et evolution, we fored a 1-

dimensional vertial line of permittivity ǫ′

and length 70, starting at the entral site of

the bottom boundary, as shown in the inset of (cid:28)g. 4. In this (cid:28)gure, we plot the energies U

obtained after a loal hange of eah neighbor permittivity towards ǫ′

, as a funtion of neigh-

bor position. We used the same boundary onditions mentioned in the previous paragraph,

ǫ = 1 and ǫ′ = 3. In this ase, a permittivity hange in the neighbor just above the tip gives

the pattern of highest U, explaining the previous vertial line evolution. This plot provides

muh more information than just tip e(cid:27)et evolution. If an independent mehanism, like

surfae tension, is introdued to prevent tip evolution, the left and right lowest neighbors

ould begin to evolve.

To summarize: We have obtained non trivial patterns using a simple and well known

energy funtional. Contrary to other models, our model is not stohasti and the generated

patterns are not of dynamial origin. Our model needs muh more omputing time than other

models in the literature, beause the system has to probe di(cid:27)erent possible on(cid:28)gurations and

selet the one minimizing the total energy. We have seen the appearane of a return branh,

whih is typially found in real lightning. We obtained the breaking of hiral symmetry in a

global pattern, as a onsequene of degeneray and time evolution. In irular geometries,

the patterns obtained using our model, show branhes that are roughly idential in length,

we obtained this very important result straightforward by letting the system to evolve loally

towards a on(cid:28)guration of minimal energy. For the same set of parameters we have seen

a pattern to grow (cid:28)rst in a ompat form, and after reahing a ritial size the system

begin to form branhes. For some geometries tip growing is favored, for other geometries

the system try to inrease the width of the hannel. Beause the evolving pattern hanges

the geometry, and the evolution depends on system history, there are many possibilities for

Abstract

A careful study is made of the operational meaning of the time symbols appearing in the
space-time Lorentz transformation. Four distinct symbols, with diﬀerent physical meanings, are
needed to describe reciprocal measurements involving stationary and uniformly-moving clocks.
Physical predictions concern only the observed rate of a clock as a function of its relative speed,
not its setting. How the failure to make this distinction leads to the conventional predictions
of spurious ‘relativity of simultaneity’ and ‘length contraction’ eﬀects in special relativity is
explained.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the physical consequences, for measurements

of space and time intervals, of the Lorentz transformationa (LT):

x′ = γ[x − vt]
vx
t′ = γ[t −
c2 ]
y′ = y
z′ = z

(1)

(3)
(4)

where γ ≡ 1/p1 − (v/c)2 and c is the speed of light in vacuum. For this it is necessary
to establish the exact operational correspondence between the mathematical symbols
representing space-time events (x,y,z,t) and (x′,y′,z′,t′) in two inertial frames S and S’
and actual clock readings and measured spatial intervals. In the LT (1)-(4) the Cartesian
spatial axes of S and S’ are parallel and the frame S’ is in uniform motion, relative to S
along the common x, x′ axis, with velocity v.

In order apply the LT to any experiment, the times t and t′ must be identiﬁed with
those recorded by clocks at rest in either S or S’. The simplest experiment that can
be conceived will use just one clock in each frame, say, C and C’. Using these clocks
two diﬀerent, but reciprocal, experiments may be performed. The two clocks may be
viewed from S, or they may be viewed from S’. In order to describe these experiments,

aThe Lorentz Transformation (1)-(4) was ﬁrst written down in the Literature by Larmor in 1900 [1]. See [2] for
a discussion of the historical priority issues. It was independently derived by Einstein [3] and given by Poincar´e [4]
In Lorentz’s last pre-relativity paper [5]
in 1905. The appellation ‘Lorentz Transformation’ is due to Poincar´e.
another space-time transformation was given, from which the Lorentz Transformation (1)-(4) may be obtained by the
substitution: x → x − vt.

four physically distinct time symbols are required: τ , t′, τ ′ and t. The symbols τ (τ ′)
represent the times recorded by the stationary clocks C (C’) as observed in S (S’), while
the symbols t (t′) represent the times recorded by the moving clocks C (C’) as observed
from S’(S).

To analyse these experiments it will be found convenient to use the invariant interval
relations [6] connecting τ ,t′ or τ ′,t that may be derived from the LT (1)-(4), or its inverse:

c2(∆t)2 − (∆x)2 = c2(∆τ

)2 − (∆x

)2

Eqn(5) describes the experiment where C’ is viewed from S, so that so that the trans-
formed events lie on the world line of C’. Since C’ is at rest in S’, ∆x′ = 0, while its
equation of motion in motion in S is: ∆x = v∆τ . Thus (5) may be written as

or

c2(∆t′)2 = c2(1 −

v2
c2 )(∆τ )2

Similarly, (6) describes the experiment where C is viewed from S’, and the transformed
events lie on the world line of C. In this case ∆x = 0, and ∆x′ = −v∆τ ′ so that Eqn(6)
gives:

The equations (7) and (8) describe the relativistic time dilatation (TD) eﬀect. In may be
succinctly stated as follows:

∆τ = γ∆t′

∆τ ′ = γ∆t

This relation holds for clocks of any construction whatever, and is, as ﬁrst emphasised
by Einstein, of a purely kinematical nature.

In order to discuss length interval measurements in two diﬀerent inertial frames, at
least four clocks are needed, say, CA and CB , at rest in S, and CA′ and CB′ at rest
in S’. Suppose that CA and CB lie along the x-axis, separated by the distance L. The
separation of CA′ and CB′ , L′, is chosen in such a way that when the x-coordinates of CA
and CA′ coincide, so do those of CB and CB′ . At this instant, suppose that the readings
of the clocks in the frame S are: τ0(CA ), τ0(CB ), t′
0(CB′ ). Consider now
the invariant interval relation between an arbitary event on the worldline of CA′ and an
arbitary event on the worldline of CB′ , in an experiment where, as in (5), these clocks
are viewed from S:

0(CA′ ) and t′

(∆s)2 ≡ (L′)2 − c2[t′(CB′) − t′(CA′) − (t′

0(CB′) − t′

0(CA′))]2

= [x(CB′) − x(CA′)]2 − c2[τ (CB) − τ (CA) − (τ0(CB) − τ0(CA))]2

(10)

In this equation the readings of the unsynchroniesd clocks are subsituted directly into
the invariant interval relation. The temporal terms may be understood by considering,
say, the clocks CA and CB . Since the readings of these clocks are τ0(CA ) and τ0(CB )

2

at a particular instant, the readings of the clocks at later times τ (CA ) and τ (CB ) are
simultaneous provided that:

τ (CB) − τ (CA) = τ0(CB) − τ0(CA)

(11)

which correponds, correctly, to ∆τ = 0 on the right side of (10). This assumes only that
the clocks CA and CB run at the same rate. Introducing the time intervals

etc, (10) may be written as:

∆τA ≡ τ (CA) − τ0(CA)

(∆s)2 ≡ (L′)2 − c2[∆t′

B′ − ∆t′
= [x(CB′) − x(CA′)]2 − c2[∆τB − ∆τA]2

A′]2

(12)

(13)

(14)

The separation, L, of CA′ and CB′ in S is deﬁned as x(CB′ )-x(CA′ ) at some ﬁxed instant
of time in S, i.e. the condition (11) is satisﬁed, so that ∆τB = ∆τA. Eqn(12) then gives:

(∆s)2 ≡ (L′)2 − c2[∆t′

B′ − ∆t′

A′]2 = L2

According to the TD formula (7), ∆τA = γ∆t′
then ∆t′
A′. Eqn(13) then gives simply:

B′ = ∆t′

A′ and ∆τB = γ∆t′

B′, so that if ∆τB = ∆τA

′
∆s = L

= L

The spatial separation of the clocks is therefore a Lorentz invariant quantity [7] that has
the same value in all inertial frames –there is no ‘relativistic length contraction’. How
this spurious eﬀect arises in the standard interpretation, in special relativity, of the LT
will be explained below.

In the calculations above, no speciﬁc system of spatio-temporal coordinates was consid-
ered. All the results were obtained from coordinate-frame-independent invariant interval
relations. The same results will now be rederived using directly the LT with a particular
choice of spatial coordinates and ‘clock synchronisation convention’. The latter concept
will be ﬁrst explained. A clock or a watch is intended to record time intervals. Its pre-
cision depends on how well the rate of the clock stays constant as a function of elapsed
time. This requires understanding and control of the physical processes underlying the
operation of the clock. Clocks and watches usually have a knob by which the actual time
indicated may be ‘set’. This setting process may be performed in an arbitary manner
by the clock owner, but is completely unrelated to the physics of the clock mechanism
which determines only the rate at which the clock runs. Sometimes, as in the case of a
stopwatch, there may also be a button that simply resets the indicated time to zero. As
discussed above, when the LT is used to predict the results of space-time experiments
at least one moving and one stationary clock is required. In general, the initial times
displayed by these clocks can be set to arbitary values without aﬀecting any physical
predictions. For concreteness, suppose that both clocks are stopped (i.e. no longer record
time) and the moving and stationary ones are set to the values t′
0 and τ0 respectively.
As previously, the moving clock is conﬁned to the x-axis of the frame S. When the x-
coordinates of the clocks coincide they are both started (i.e. begin to record time). The
two numbers t′
0 and τ0 deﬁne a particular ‘clock synchronisation convention’(CSC). All

3

predictions for physical eﬀects are independent of this convention. This method to syn-
chronise two clocks in diﬀerent inertial frames was termed ‘external synchronisation’ by
Mansouri and Sexl [8].

It is easily seen that the xt LT of Eqns (1) and (2) above, cannot be used to implement
a general CSC as described above. Setting x = x′ = 0, when the clocks in S and S’ have
the same x-coordinate, then (1) gives t ≡ τ = 0, so that, in consequence, (2) gives t′ = 0.
This means that the particular CSC t′
0 = τ0 = 0 is built into the LT (1)-(2) at x = x′ = 0.
It is like a stop watch that can be reset, but not set! Worse, as will be shown below,
it can only be reset at one particular spatial location. The modiﬁcation of the LT (1)-
(2) to enable the implementation of a general CSC (allowing it to describe, not only a
stopwatch, but also a watch with knobs that enable to set the clock hands at any chosen
positions) is straightforward. Eqns(1) and (2) are replaced by:

x′ = γ[x − v(τ − τ0)]
vx
0 = γ[τ − τ0 −
c2 ]

t′ − t′

where, as discussed above, the symbol τ is used for the time indicated by the clock a
rest in S, and t′ for the time indicated by the clock at rest in S’, as viewed for S. At
the expense of adding the two parameters τ0 and t′
0 the general CSC is now applied to
the clocks when their x-coordinates coincide at x = x′ = 0. However, if the clocks are
somewhere else (say at x = x′ = L), or if it is wished to use a diﬀerent coordinate system
to specify the position of the clocks, but to use the same CSC, (15) and (16) will not
work, any more than does the LT (1) and (2). The solution, as in going from (1)-(2)
to (15)-(16), is to make the replacements τ → τ − τ (L) and t′ → t′ − t′(L) in (15) and
(16) where the constants τ (L) and t′(L) are now to be chosen in such a way that the two
clocks at x = x′ = L will have the same CSC as the clocks at x = x′ = 0 described by
(15) and (16). For this τ (L) and t′(L) must satisfy the equations:

The solution of (17) and (18) is

This is the LT appropriate for a clock pair at x = x′ = L that has the same CSC as the
clock pair at x = x′ = 0 that is described by (15) and (16).

Introducing the relative coordinates:

ˆx ≡ x − xC′(τ = τ0)
′ − x
′ ≡ x
ˆx

′
C′

where xC′ and x′
(23),(24) may be written as:

C′ are the coordinates of C’ in S and S’ respectively, both (15),(16) and

ˆx′ = γ[ˆx − v(τ − τ0)] = 0

t′ − t′

vˆx
c2 ]
which is similar to the original LT (1) and (2) when t′
0 = τ0 = 0. except that the origin of
the coordinate system in S’ always coincides with the position of the clock C’, whatever
its spatial position. The LT (27)-(28) has been called elsewhere a ‘local’ LT [9].

0 = γ[τ − τ0 −

(28)

Using (27) to eliminate ˆx from (28) yields:

τ − τ0 = γ(t′ − t′
0)

which is Eqn(7) above. These equations predict the same TD eﬀect for any pair of
clocks with the same synchronistion convention, independently of their spatial positions.
Applying (27) to the clock CA′ at x′ = 0 and CB′ at x′ = L gives:

x′(CA′) = 0,
x′(CB′) = L,

x(CA′) = v(τ − τ0)
x(CB′) = v(τ − τ0) + L

It follows from (30) and (31) that:

x′(CB′) − x′(CA′) = x(CB′) − x(CA′) = L

in agreement with (14) above, showing that there is no ‘relativistic length contraction’
eﬀect. The equations of motion of the clocks CA′ and CB′ in the frame S in (30) and
(31) are the same as in Galilean relativity. Since the correlated length contraction and
relativity of simultaneity eﬀects do not exist (the calculational error from which they
originate is explained below) the sole modiﬁcation of the physics of space-time resulting
from the LT is to replace the relation

τ − τ0 = t′ − t′
0

expressing the absolute (Newtonian) character of time in Galilean relativity by the TD
relation (29). Therefore only the concept of time, not of space, requires modiﬁcation in
the passage from Galilean to special relativity.

The origin of the spurious ‘relativity of simultaneity” and ‘length contraction’ eﬀects of
conventional special relativity theory will now be explained. The LT (1)-(2) corresponds
0 = 0 for a clock CA′ situated at the x′-origin in S’. If exactly the same
to the CSC τ0 = t′
LT is applied to a clock CB′ at x′ = L′ at t ≡ τ = 0 the following equations are obtained:

0 = −vL′/c2 instead of τ0 = t′

Thus the CSC for CB′ is τ0 = 0, t′
0 = 0 when the same LT is
applied at x′ = 0. As mentioned earlier, the resetable-to-zero stopwatch described by the
LT (1)-(2) at x′ = 0 no longer works when x′ 6= 0. In standard special relativity theory,
to date, this trivial diﬀerence in the synchronisation convention given by the LT (1)-(2)
when x′
6= 0 has been interpreted as a real physical eﬀect –‘relativity of simultaneity’
(RS). Introducing the clock CA′ at x′ = 0 for which x(CA′) = x′(CA′) = 0 at τ = 0,
Eqn(34) may be written as:

′
L

′
= x

′
(CB′) − x

(CA′) = γ[x(CB′) − x(CA′)] ≡ γL

(36)

This is the spurious ‘length contraction’ (LC) eﬀect –the distance between the clocks is
predicted to be shorter by the fraction 1/γ in the frame S in which they are in motion.
It is also clear by considering in detail the motion of the clocks in a single frame of
reference [9], or by direct use of the reciprocity postulate [10], that the LC eﬀect of
Eqn(36) is not a genuine physical eﬀect. Both it and the RS eﬀect of Eqn(35) are the
result of misinterpretation of the time symbols in Eqns(1) and (2). These represent clock
settings which are, intially, ﬁxed at t = t′ = 0 by the condition x = x′ = 0, but which may,
in general, be freely chosen to have any values when x = x′ = 0, as in Eqns(15) and (16).
They are not times recorded by synchronised clocks at any values of x and x′, as assumed
in the conventional interpretation of Eqns(34) and (35). The only physical prediction of
the LT concerning moving clocks is the TD eﬀect of Eqn(9). The spurious RS and LC
eﬀects are the result of a confusion between arbitary clock settings and physical time
intervals. Physics determines only the rates of clocks. Their settings are arbitary and
have no physical signiﬁcance.

Although it is clear from the arguments presented above that the RS eﬀect is a spu-
rious one, its existence (or non-existence) is still experimentally testable. Some speciﬁc
experiments have recently been proposed to search for the RS eﬀect [11]. At the time of
writing, there is ample experimental veriﬁcation of TD but none of RS or LC [9].

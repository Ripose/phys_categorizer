Abstract

We consider the puzzle of cosmic voids bounded by two dimensional
structures of galactic clusters as also a puzzle pointed out by Weinberg:
How can the mass of a typical elementary particle depend on a cosmic
parameter like the Hubble constant? An answer to the ﬁrst puzzle
is proposed in terms of “Scaled” Quantum Mechanical like behaviour
which appears at large scales. The second puzzle can be answered by
showing that the Gravitational mass of an elementary particle has a
Machian character.

1 Large Scale Structures

Our view of the universe has been continuously evolving over the centuries.
Thus Newton’s universe was one in which the stars were the building blocks.
These building blocks were stationary in the universe. After about two cen-
turies this view underwent a transformation, with the discovery in the early
twentieth century by Hubble that the so called galactic nebulae were star sys-
tems or galaxies, each containing something like a hundred thousand million
stars, and these galaxies themselves being at distances far far beyond those
of stars. The building blocks were now the galaxies. Then the Red Shift
studies of galaxies by V.M. Slipher showed that the galaxies were all rushing
outwards. Thus was born the precursor of what has come to be known as the
standard Big Bang Cosmology. Soon it was realized that there were clusters

1

of galaxies which would more correctly qualify as the building blocks, and
then super clusters. Within clusters and super clusters, there could be depar-
tures from the Hubble velocity distance law. The law therefore represented
something happening at a very large scale.
A further development that came about in the 1980s threw up a dramatically
diﬀerent scenario. The very large clusters of galaxies seemed to lie on bubble
or balloon like sheets, there being voids or very thinly populated regions in
the interiors. These voids would have dimensions of the order of a hundred
million light years [1, 2, 3, 4]. This has been a puzzle thrown up in the late
twentieth century: Exactly why do we have the voids and why do we have
polymer like two dimensional structures on the surfaces of these voids? The
puzzle is compounded by the fact that given the dispersion velocities of the
galaxies of the order of a thousand kilometers per second, it would still take
periods of time greater than the age of the universe, of the order of 13 billion
years, for them to move out of an otherwise uniform distribution, leaving
voids in their wake. An interesting suggestion was that the galaxies consist-
ing of ordinary matter were ﬂoating on the “voids” which are actually made
up of dark matter. In any case, latest developments have marginalized dark
matter in favour of dark energy.
One of the few explanations for this large scale structure of the universe has
been the pancake model of Zeldovich [5]. Essentially according to this model,
much of the matter of the universe was in the form of a thin pancake which
broke up into pieces, the pieces then forming the clusters of galaxies and
galaxies, which have inherited the two dimensional character. Indeed studies
have suggested this two dimensional character [6].
In the above context we consider the model of “Scaled” Quantum Eﬀects
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. To sum up the main results: It is argued that the struc-
tures of the unvierse at diﬀerent scales mimic Brownian eﬀects, which again
lead to a Quantum behavior with diﬀerent “Scaled” Planck constants. Thus

Infact Equations (1) to (5) correspond to the empirically well known Weyl-
Eddington formula. It was argued that they express Random Walk eﬀects
in a Nelson like approach [13, 14, 15]. The origin of Equations (1) to (5) is,
rather than being empirical, due to gravitational orbits and the conservation
of angular momentum viz.,

where L, M, v represent typical length (or dispersion in length), mass and
velocities at that scale and H denotes the scaled Planck constant.

where m is the mass of an elementary particle like the pion, H ′ the Hubble

parallel with Quantum theory. For example we have for the universe at large

The above considerations lead via the diﬀusion process to the Schrodinger
like equation [15, 16],

for diﬀerent hı given by equations (6) to (9).
Before proceeding further we may point out that (1) to (5) already indicate
the two dimensionality referred to above. Infact alternatively, the theory is
modelled on a phase transition viz., the Landau-Ginzburg theory applied to
an equation like (14). (Such a phase transitioin would also explain what the
movement of galaxies under normal circumstances cannot, that is the large
size of the voids.) Infact to put it brieﬂy, under such phase transitions we
have equations like

( ¯Q) =

β, ( ¯ξ) =

where typically ν

, ¯ξ = (l/R)2

(16)

Whence on using (15) we recover the Weyl-Eddington like equations (1) to
(5). This is yet another derivation.

Let us see if the above model can give an estimate for the size of the voids.
Infact we have to revert to the Schrodinger like equation (14) with a hydro-
gen like atom, except that GM 2 replaces Ze2 of the hydrogen atom. Let
us consider the hydrogen like wave functions at a scale of galaxies with hı
replaced by h2 given above. The radial part of a typical wave functioin would
be given by [17]

It is easy to verify that the expression (17) is a maximum with ρ given by,

Infact (18) gives us back, the Weinberg like formula (11) encountered earlier.
We thus have from (18) after a simple calculation and feeding in the values
for h2 and M
The point is that at radial distances like r given above, there would be a
greater concentration of galaxies while within this value of r the distribution
would be comparatively sparse. We must also remember that there is the
angular part of the “wave function”, which means that each value of r really
corresponds to a spherical shell.
Thus it is a consequence of Scaled Quantum Eﬀects arising due to the gravi-
tational forces (10) that lead to the bubble and void structure of the universe.
Similar arguments could be put forth for the pancake structure of galaxies
themselves.

2 The Puzzle of Gravitation

There is a well known relation, some times referred to as the Weinberg for-
mula, which is (12). Equation (12) has been considered to be a purely acci-
dental relation. However as Weinberg notes [18] “...it should be noted that
the particular combination of ¯h, H, G, and c appearing (in the formula) is
very much closer to a typical elementary particle mass than other random
combinations of these quantities; for instance, from ¯h, G, and c alone one can
form a single quantity (¯hc/G)1/2 with the dimensions of a mass, but this has
1022MeV /c2, more than a typical particle mass by about 20
the value 1.22
orders of magnitude!
“In considering the possible interpretations (of the formula), one should be

×

5

careful to distinguish it from other numerical “coincidences”... In contrast,
(the formula) relates a single cosmological parameter, H, to the fundamental
constants ¯h, G, c and m, and is so far unexplained.”
We will now argue that (12) represents a Machian or holistic eﬀect.
Let us consider the gravitational self interaction of a particle (Cf.
ref.[19]). Our starting point is the action functional

where φ is some potential whose nature is not as yet speciﬁed, G being some
coupling constant. The extremum conditions of action with respect to Ψ∗

Thus, the equations (19) and (20) describe a self-interacting particle. It is
well known that an exact solution to (20) is given by

φ(~r, t) =

G

dΩ(~r)

Z

ρ(~r, t)

where Ω is the three dimensional region which conﬁnes the particle, and we
have deﬁned

ρ(~r, t) = mΨ∗(~r, t)Ψ(~r, t)

From (21), we can immediately see that for distances far outside the region
Ω, that is

, the potential φ has the form

<<

(19)

(21)

(23)

where r =

M =

dΩ(~r)Ψ∗(~r, t)Ψ(~r, t)

(24)

The integral on the right hand side of (24) is conserved in time due to (19):

∂
∂t Z

Ω

dΩ(~r)Ψ∗(~r, t)Ψ(~r, t) = 0

Thus the quantity M is constant, and we can interpret (23) and (24) as
follows. The attractive potential (23) is now the classical gravitational po-
tential, M is the gravitational mass, G being the gravitational constant. If
we prescribe the unit value to the above conserved functional and interpret
it as the norm square, I 2, or the full probability

I 2 =

Ω

Z

dΩ(~r)Ψ∗(~r, t)Ψ(~r, t) = 1,

then the gravitational mass coincides with the inertial mass,

m = M,

(25)

and the quantity (22) now can be interpreted as the mass probability denslity.
The source term on the right side of (20) is equal to the particle probability
density itself.
Now, let us consider the self-consistent problem - the particle in its own po-
tential well. We cannot obtain an exact solution. However, we can approx-
imately describe some features of such a solution. The ﬁrst assumption will
be that we deal only with a spherically symmetric wave function: Ψ = Ψ(r, t)
where r is a radial coordinate. Then the mass probability density has the
same dependence: ρ = ρ(r, t). It can be easily shown that for any spherical
mass distribution, the potential (21) is reducible to a simple form

φ(r, t) = G

where we denote

and m(r, t) is just the mass inside a ball of radius r. Certainly, the solu-
tion (26) gives an exact formula (23) with the mass (25) for the point mass
distribution. Further, we shall use the value Φ instead of the potential φ:

φ(r, t) = mGΦ(r, t)

The coeﬃcient of Φ in (27) has the dimensionality of inverse length. Thus,

Equation (28) is nothing but (12) the Weinberg formula again if we identify
lG with the radius of the Universe and rememeber that,

All this shows that the mass m of an elementary particle is very Machian,
rather than being microphysical, if G is microphysical.
However in a ﬂuctuational model of cosmology, which correctly predicted in
advance a dark energy driven accelerating Universe with a small cosmological
constant, (12) and several other, so called Large Number Relations made
famous by Dirac [20, 10, 21] were actually deduced from the theory. In this
model it turns out that

∼

1080 is the number of elementary particles in the Universe. Indeed
where N
(29) was shown to be an alternative form of (12). Moreover it was argued
[22, 16] that (29) or equivalently (12) shows up gravitation as a distributional
eﬀect over the N elementary particles which constitute the Universe. In this
case G would not be a microphysical constant.
The following argument throws further light on the above considerations. We
identify the inertial energy of a typical elementary particle with its gravita-
tional energy due to all the remaining N elementary particles in the Universe.
This gives

Using the well known so called Weyl-Eddington formula,

which infact was deduced in the cosmological model referred to (Cf.ref.[20,
10]), the above becomes identical to (29) or (12).

It is ofcourse well known that attempts to unify gravitation and electromag-
netism, starting with the attempt of Hermann Weyl to present day Quantum
Gravity approaches have not been very successful [16]. Indeed While Pauli
had remarked in this context that one should not try to unite what God
had intended to be asunder, as Witten put it, [23] “The existence of gravity
clashes with our description of the rest of physics by quantum ﬁelds”. The
above considerations show that gravitation has a diﬀerent, indeed distribu-
tional character. However, (29), on using e2

Abstract

The results of long-term (two-year) experimental observations of frequencies of two
quartz resonators, one of which is placed in special magnetic system that creates vec-
tor potential ﬁeld, another (calibration one) is placed outside this system, have been
presented. Changes with diﬀerent periodicity: 24 h, high-deﬁnite 7 days complex-
form period, 27 days and year periods were detected during the observation of
diﬀerences of these quartz resonators frequencies. The tangents which have been
drawn to a terrestrial parallel at the moment of near-daily observation of measured
quantity minima form the basic, most powerful subset of directions of tangents hav-
ing a sharp corner with dipole component of vector potential of the Sun’ magnetic
ﬁeld in a range from 50◦ up to 80◦ at annual rotation of laboratory around the Sun
together with the Earth. Also there are three subsets of directions similarly drawn
tangents ﬁxed in physical space that coincide with similar subsets of tangents di-
rections drawn in the same way to points of radioactive elements β-decay count
rate minimum under the long β-decay research during daily and annual rotation of
laboratory together with the Earth. It is necessary to point out that the form of the
curves of quartzes frequencies diﬀerence changes in scales of the 7-day’s period with
reliability coincides next year, and observable minima of frequencies in co-phase
points of space coincide to within several tens minutes. It is shown that the ampli-
tude of the signal was 5 ÷ 10 times lesser in the period from 20-th, July, till 20-th,

1 Introduction.

In Refs.[1-6] the experiments are described in which, with the use of high-
current magnets, torsion and piezoresonance balances, the new phenomena
were for the ﬁrst time detected. These phenomena may be interpreted as a
new interaction of objects in nature, distinct from the known strong, electro-
magnetic, and gravitational interactions. The main distinctive property of this
interaction is its spatial anisotropy. The new interaction is associated, from
our viewpoint, with the existence of a new fundamental vectorial constant-
cosmological vector potential Ag substantiated in Refs.[5,6] where the pro-
cesses of formation of charge numbers of elementary particles are studied
and hence, the gauge invariance is violated. Thus the potentials of physi-
cal ﬁelds acquire a physical sense in such a theory and become measurable
on the set of formation of charge numbers of elementary particles (the elec-
tric charge, particularly). According to Refs. [4-6], the anisotropic interac-
tion is nonlinear, nonlocal, and representable by a series in a change (dif-
ference) of some summary vector potential AΣ at the location points of a
”sensor” and ”test” body. The summary vector potential includes the vecto-
rial potentials from all the sources of currents and magnetic ﬁelds (for exam-
ple, from the Sun A⊙, the Earth AE, the solenoids, etc). Therewith always
|AΣ| ≤ |Ag| ≈ 1, 95 × 1011Gs · cm.

The nonlocality of the new interaction manifests itself in that its magnitude
depends on the diﬀerence of values of AΣ determined at the points of location
of the ”sensor” and the ”test” body. If, for example, both are at the same
AΣ, the new force will be zero [5,6]. The property described manifests itself
as when the ”sensor” and ”test” body are ”conﬂuenced” at one point of space,
so when the values of AΣ are equal at diﬀerent spatial points. The latter is
easily seen from the analysis of the ﬁrst term of expansion of the expression

Here x – is the spatial coordinate of the observable physical space R3. The
same anisotropic properties of the new interaction manifest themselves in a
huge range of scales: from 10−17cm up to 1028cm, as well as in various phe-
nomena. For example, it is shown in Ref.[7] that the observed variations in the
count rate of β-decay of radioactive elements 60Co, 137Cs up to ∼ (0.7 − 0.8)%
when the tangent line to the earth’s parallel of latitude drawn at the mo-
ment of observation of the minimum decay rate at the place of location of
the laboratory during its rotation together with the Earth, passes through
certain spatial directions. In Refs. [8,9] the results of long-term (∼ 1 year)
experimental investigations of the heat release in plasma devices of plasma
generator-type in dependence on the spatial orientation of their discharge cur-
rents, are presented. The experiments have shown that the maximum action
of the new force is observed at each point of space along the generatrix of a
cone formed by this generatrix around the vector Ag with an opening angle of
∼ (90 − 100)◦ when the vector potential A of any current (magnetic) system
is directed oppositely to the vector Ag at an angle of ∼ (130 − 135)◦. At that
the vector Ag has the following coordinates in the second equatorial system:
right ascension α ≈ 293◦ ± 10◦, declination δ ≈ 36◦ ± 10◦.

The spatial directions found in the above mentioned work [7] and in the earlier
works on investigating the variations of the rate of β-decay of various radioac-
tive elements [10-13], are aligned with the generatrix of the above mentioned
cone (with an accuracy of ±10◦), or correspond to the direction of the vector
Ag. It should be noted that the variations in the α and β-decay rates of ra-
dioactive elements observed also in Ref.[14] may be qualitatively explained in
the context of Refs.[5,6].

In the Refs. [5,6,15,16] while using quartz gravimeters Sodin and an attached
magnet, the signals of unknown nature were detected, too. They cannot be
explained within the scope of existing physical views. The axes of sensitivity
of gravimeters (normal to the Earth) at the moments of appearance of signals,
were also directed along the genetatrix of the above indicated cone with an
accuracy of ±10◦. The amplitude of the signal reached up to 15 moon tides in
some cases. The phenomenon discovered obtains an explanation on the basis
of the new anisotropic force.

It should be noted that the attempts to detect a ”nonelectromagnetic cosmo-
physical interaction” were undertaken not only in the listed works [5-7,15,16]
but also earlier [17,18]. In Ref. [17], a system of quartz resonators was used
for this purpose. In Ref. [18], when analyzing the results of long-term work

3

of atomic frequency standards, an action of external disturbances was de-
tected which had a gravitation-wave character (by the authors’ meaning). In
Ref. [18], in a run of measurements of diﬀerential frequency in the system
of quartz resonators, there were revealed: a daily period; a correlation with
the radioradiation of the Sun and with the gleam intencity of photobacterial
culture; an advancing correlation with the geomagnetic activity. These results
were also interpreted as having a gravitation-wave nature, but in the form of
an abstract hypothesis without consideration of speciﬁc mechanisms.

The aim of the present work is an experimental study of a new quantum in-
formation channel (QIC) in nature, associated with the presumed anisotropic
interaction of objects with the physical vacuum, by a system of quartz res-
onators.

2 The scheme of experiment.

The experiment was carried out at TsNIIMASH during two years uninterrupt-
edly. The ﬁrst results (over six months) are presented in Ref. [19].

Fig. 1. The experimental setup (all notes see in the text).

Figure 1 outlines the experimental setup. The element sensitive to the quan-
tum information channel is the quartz resonator 1 of the quartz generator
QG1 placed within the magnetic system 2 of permanent magnets 3 creating a
magnetic ﬁeld of about 3500G in the magnetic circuit. The quartz resonator 1
is mounted on a conducting base 4 that allows it to be positioned in the space
region with the minimal ﬁeld of B ∼ 1G. The magnetic system 2 is the source
of the vector potential ﬁeld 5 and of the gradient of the change in the modulus
∂∆AΣ
of a certain sum potential AΣ (i.e.,
, see (1)) that comprises the above-
∂x
mentioned cosmological vector potential Ag and the potentials of all natural

4

and artiﬁcial magnetic sources. System 2 acts as an ampliﬁer of signals pass-
ing through the structure of physical vacuum. Such signals, i.e. any changes
in ∆AΣ , by themselves may have negligibly small amplitudes because of the
immense cosmic scale of the regions of ∆AΣ changes and, therefore, may be
practically unobservable without the magnetic system 2. The system register-
ing the new signals includes a reference quartz resonator 6 of generator QG2
situated outside the magnetic system, about 1m away from QG1. Both quartz
resonators and the electronic unit 7 are housed in a closed thick-wall metal
chamber 8, which signiﬁcantly screens the external electromagnetic interfer-
ence and also acts as a thermal damper and shield against various extraneous
inﬂuences (such as air convection). Beside the chamber is a personal computer
(PC) 9 registering the experimental parameters.

Fig. 2. Block-diagram of the electronic devices.

Figure 2 is a block diagram of the electronic devices for monitoring the oper-
ation of the system. For precise measurement of the changes in the frequency
f1 of the QG1 quartz resonator, as indicated above, use is made of the ref-
erence generator QG2 with frequency f2. The measured frequency diﬀerence
∆f = f2 − f1 between QG2 and QG1 characterizes, in the framework of our
concept, the change in AΣ and hence the value of the new force. When the
phase shift between the QG2 and QG1 oscillations reaches ∆ϕ = 2π, the
synchronous phase detector unit generates a pulse. The sequence of pulses
produced by the electronic scheme is fed to the PC where the time intervals
between the pulse trains are determined to an accuracy of about ∼ 5 · 10−7s.
To ensure such accuracy, the measuring board has a quartz resonator with a
frequency of 10 MHz that sets a continuous sequence of time strobes of 10−7s
duration. The results of measurements and the current time are displayed at
the PC terminal and simultaneously recorded on hard disk for storage and
further processing.

3 The results of experimental observations.

In Fig.3 the results of two-year experiment started on August 03, 2000, are
shown. The heavy line corresponds to the behavior of 1/∆f , the thin line does
to the variation of temperature. The latter was measured daily in the morning
by a mercury thermometer accurate to 0.1 degree which was positioned in the

5

chamber with quartzs. It is seen from the Figure that both dependencies have
very close yearly cycles.

Fig. 3. The results of two-year experiment started on August 03, 2000. Bold line
corresponds to the behavior of 1/∆f , the thin line does to the variation of temper-
ature.

The results of Fourier - analysis for the whole number of data in the hour’s
and daily ranges are presented in Figs.4-6. As evident from the Figures, a
near-hour’s, near -weekly, and near - 27-dayly periods stand out.

In Fig. 7, the changes in 1/∆f (or, what is the same, changes in the phase run
between two quartzs) for time intervals from 02.10.2000 till 10.10.2000 and
from 02.10.2000 till 09.10.2001, are shown. The striking similarity of Figures
as to the form of signals so to the time points of minimum observations (with
the maximum discrepancy between those being no more than several tens of
minutes) argues for the non-randomness of the process in observation. The
weekly complex-shaped cycle shown (Fig. 7) was observed in the course of the
whole experiment.

At ﬁrst sight it would seem from the Fig.3 that the phenomenon observed was
caused by temperature oscillations. To check that possibility, we have taken
special measurements of temperature each hour during two and half days. The
results are given in Fig.8. It is clear that the near-daily oscillations of 1/∆f
cannot be explained by the changes in temperature.

from Fig.3. To study the response of the system, it is shown in Fig.9 that the
linear part of the temperature (t) dependence of ∆f can be approximated by
the regression f = 5, 49 − 0, 25 ∗ t. The results subtraction of this dependence
from the values of two-year observation of changes in ∆f , are presented in
Fig.10. The more than two - fold outliers of ∆f above the standard deviation,
are numbered.

In Fig.11 the trajectory curve of Earth’s motion around the Sun is shown.
At a stable position of the Sun’s dipole this curve is very close to the line
of the vectorial potential of the Sun’s magnetic dipole. Shown are also the
trajectories of the motion of the laboratory during its rotation together with
the Earth (those are very close to the lines of the vectorial potential of terres-
trial magnetic ﬁeld) as well as the positions of the laboratory at time points
of observation of minimum 1/∆f . Large crosses denotes in Fig.11 the spatial
location of the outliers numbered in Fig.10. As is seen from Fig.11, the time
interval between the outliers (2,3) and (6,7) practically repeats after the year.
The rest of outliers (1,4,5,8) will be discussed below. In the present paper we
consider in more detail only several time intervals as to observation of changes
in 1/∆f .

In Fig.12 are shown such changes (more exactly, the phase run in seconds)
within the span from 01.11.2000 till 26.11.2000, as well as the changes in tem-

Fig. 10. Changes in ∆f reducing by linear temperature regression f = 5,49 - 0,25*t
(Fig.9) during two-years experiment. More than two-fold outliers of ∆f above the
standard deviation, are numbered.

As is seen from the Figure, the tangent lines form three well deﬁned spatial
directions with an accuracy of ±10◦. In Fig.13 are shown the changes of 1/∆f
over the period from 01.04.2002 till 19.04.2002. The similar tangents can be
seen in Fig.11. As is evident from this Figure, the directions of arrows are near
- alike (with the spread of ±10◦). The changes of 1/∆f from 01.08.2002 till
14.08.2002 are given in Fig.14, and the corresponding tangents are in Fig.11.
Most of the arrows have the same but new direction with the spread of ±10◦ .
One arrow is directed similarly to those (7,11,12,18,19) from the above shown
experimental series (from 01.11.2000 till 26.11.2000). To obtain the general
estimation of the role of the technogenic factor (in the workdays), in Fig.15
are presented the changes of 1/∆f observed in the holidays from 30.04.2002
till 06.05.2002. The tangent lines drawn in the above manner at the instants
of time when the correspondent numbered minimums of 1/∆f were observed,
are presented in Fig.11. It is seen from that Figure that the tangents have
approximately the same common direction. That has an angle of ∼ 30◦ with
the common direction in the series of measurement of 1/∆f changes over the
period from 01.04.2002 till 18.04.2002. An analysis of directions of above dis-
cussed tangents have shown that the major set of them is always directed at
an angle of 50◦ ÷ 80◦ to the line of the vectorial potential of the Sun A⊙.
That is, this set of directions is constantly turned in accordance with the mo-
tion of the Earth along its trajectory around the Sun. The less representative

set of directions of tangent lines considered simply does not respond to the
motion of the Earth and is always positioned on the above mentioned cone
of direction of the new force. In the process of motion around the Sun, the
basic set of tangents practically coincides with the directions of the axis or
the generatrix of the cone considered during a third of the year (see Fig.11).
It is notable that the vector Ag is directed along the axis of the cone in con-
sideration. At the period from 11.10.2002 till 26.10.2002, the inﬂuence of the
magnetic system on the change of 1/∆f was investigated. The magnetic sys-
tem (2) in Fig.1 was withdrawn from the chamber but the quartzs remained
in the same position. The general character of the signal was shown to be
not changed, it corresponded to that in Figs.12-15, but the amplitude of the
signal was 25% lesser. The inﬂuence of the distance between quartzs on the
character of signal in the absence of magnetic system, was investigated, too.

Fig. 12. Changes in 1/∆f, temperature and pressure from 01.11.2000. to 26.11.2000.

The quartz resonator 6, remaining in the same plane, was connected to the
quartz resonator 1 (Fig.1), and the character of changes in 1/∆f was observed
over the period from 26.10.2002 till 06.11.2002. In the result, the amplitude of
the signal was decreased by further 25%, i.e. the change in 1/∆f was halved
as compared with the basic experiment. In Fig.16 the sequence of observation
of the time instants corresponding to minimum 1/∆f in dependence on the
starting point of the experiment, is presented. As is seen, the time points of
minimum observations intersect the regression line. The distinction between
the obtained distribution and the regression line was calculated to be con-
ﬁdent at the signiﬁcance level at least P < 0.001 using run test [21]. This
phenomenon was repeatedly observed in the experiment.

4 The analysis of experimental errors.

The errors of determining the direction of the vector Ag and the properties
of QIC with the aid of a system of quartz resonators can be subdivided into
systematic and random (statistical) ones. The systematic errors are those due
to the inﬂuence of changes in temperature, atmospheric pressure, supply-line
voltage, magnetic ﬁeld, and possible of the human factor. The statistic errors
are caused by noises in the quartz resonators and in the electronics, by ex-
actness of instrumentation (computer, voltage regulator, etc.), inaccuracy of

geometric constructions, incontrollable electromagnetic noise, and power in-
duction. Consider the systematic errors. As is seen from Fig.3, the change in
temperature plays an important role in the change of signal shapes during
many-days observation of that. Nevertheless, due to the nonlinear response of
the system of quartz resonators to the change of temperature (see Fig.3), we
succeeded, with the use of a special mathematic procedure (Fig.9), in identi-
fying its inﬂuence on the valid signal and obtaining the result shown in Fig.10.
The analysis of this result is given below. To show the independence of the
shape of the near-daily signal from the temperature, we measured its changes
hourly during the course of two and half days with the aid of an exact mer-
cury thermometer (having an accuracy of ±0, 1◦ at the place of the system
of quartz resonators). The results of that experiment are given in Fig.8. As is
seen from this Figure, the shape of temperature does not correlate with that
of the basic signal and therefore cannot be used for explanation of the main
result obtained - i.e. the shape of change of phase diﬀerence of two quartz
generators in the course of a day as well as the arrangement of the set of
directions of tangents to the Earth’s parallels of latitude drawn at the time
instants of minimum phase diﬀerences of quartz generators, in the range of
angles between 50 and 80 degrees relative to the vector A⊙ (Fig.11). The
atmospheric pressure was shown to have practically no inﬂuence on the ex-
perimental results (see Fig.12). Consider a systematic error connected with
possible voltage deviations in the system of powering quartz generators. This
error was investigated in the range of voltages between 180 and 230V at the

nominal supply-line voltage of 220V. It was shown that the voltage regulator
in the power unit of electronic equipment was not beyond the tolerance lim-
its of stabilization. The voltage of the power unit was equal to 5V±0.025V
which did not led to the change in the phase run time more that 0.5%. The
magnitude of magnetic ﬁeld below of 2000Gs is shown to act, even if insignif-
icantly (10−6f), on the change of frequency of quartz resonators [20]. There
fore the magnetic system used in the experiment considered was constructed
in such a manner that the ﬁeld magnitude at the location of quartzs to be
no more that 1Gs and hence cannot act upon the deviation of 1/∆f more
than 1%. The periodicity of the main signal (∼24 hours), appearance of the
major part of minimums at morning hours (near 10 hs), and the presence of
a seven-day period seem to indicate to the possible role of the human factor
in the experimental results. However those obtained in holydays (not work-
days!) do not conﬁrm the role of that factor (see Fig.15). As is seen from
the Figure, the periodicity and the shape of 1/∆f - changes are the same in
holydays and in workdays. Consider the random errors now. As was above
said, the frequency of thermostable quartz generators remained constant with
an accuracy of 10−7 at the standard frequency of quartzs 106Hz. Moreover,
because of diﬀerential connection of those the accuracy of measurements of
1/∆f was even more than 10−7. Thus the noise in QG could not stand out
above some percents of the amplitude of 1/∆f -deviation over the near-daily
period. The use of PCs for processing and recording the experimental results
also leads to systematic (drift of clocks of PC’s quartzs) and random errors

(malfunctions of PCs and of power units). The drift of clocks (as of thermal
so of other origin) leads to an insigniﬁcant error in time referencing of results
of measurements of quartzs’ frequency diﬀerence. That drift was equal, on the
average, to no more than several minutes per month and was corrected by
PC-operator according to the signals of Moscow time. PC was powered from
the same stabilized power-line as the QG-system. It is very diﬃcult to explain
the results of the experiment by the electromagnetic noise and corresponding
stray pick-up since the obtained periodicity (24-hour’s, weekly, 27-daily, and
yearly periods) completely contradicts to such an assumption. Nevertheless it
should be noted that in the vicinity of 1/∆f -minimums there were frequently
observed outliers with duration between ∼ 0.3 ÷ 1 sec and with amplitudes
of tens times more than the periodic f-oscillations of not yet known nature.
The geometric constructions in Fig.11 were made with the accuracy of ≈ 1◦
and could not inﬂuence on the ﬁnal conclusions as to the results of the whole
experiment.

5 Discussion of experimental results and some conclusions.

Consider the periods of 1/∆f observed in the experiment. As was said above,
we failed in attempts to explain the near-24 hour’s period in variations of 1/∆f
by the thermal factor. The ﬂuctuations of supply-line voltage (see above)

also cannot be used for explanation of the said period. As the tangents to
the Earth’s parallels of latitude drawn for time instants of minimum 1/∆f
observations always form nearly the same angle of 50◦ ÷ 80◦ with the direction
of the vectorial potential of the dipole component of the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld,
we may aﬃrm that, in all likelihood, the inﬂuence of the process of addition
of vectorial potentials of the Sun’s and Earth’s magnetic ﬁelds is observed
here because at those extremum points the angle between the said potentials
is equal to 100◦ ÷ 130◦ in the course of the total two-yearly experiment and
hence the changes in fundamental scales as well as, accordingly, in dimensions
of crystalline lattices associated with the changes of AΣ, are always much
the same at said points. The near-weekly period observed is connected, in
all probability, with some unknown technogenic factor since that cannot be
explained by the variations of voltage (which is suﬃciently stabilized), but it
is seen at the same time from Fig.7 and Fig.15 that the ”block” in the near-
weekly period (its last three days) starts always or form Friday or from the day
before holyday. The 27-daily period can be explained, as in Ref.[12], by the
period of rotation of the Sun and of vectorial potential of Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld
since in this case changes in AΣ , fundamental scales, and crystalline lattice
dimensions take place. The yearly period is also explained by the ”inﬂuence”
of the vector A⊙ on the vector AΣ during the yearly rotation of the Earth
around the Sun.

17

In all likelihood, the outliers 1,4,5 shown in Fig.10 are not random since the
corresponding tangents to the line of vector A⊙ drawn at time points of ob-
servation of those outliers, are aligned with the axis of the cone of action of
the new force (outlier 1) or with the generatrix of this cone (outliers 4,5) (see
Fig.11 and [9]). The outlier 8 (Fig.10) is practically opposite to the outliers
2,3 and 6,7 which were repeatedly observed after the year and therefore can
be also explained by the ”inﬂuence” of A⊙ on AΣ, i.e. by not yet known law
of addition of said vectors.

Before the experiments the authors anticipated that the magnetic system will
act as a peculiar ampliﬁer of signals of new nature as was observed earlier
in the experiments with the gravimeter [15,16]. However the inﬂuence of the
magnetic system was found to be less signiﬁcant (no more than 25% changes
of signal amplitude). Therefore the system of quartzs in consideration may be
thought to respond, most likely, not to the gradient of ∆AΣ but simply to
the change of ∆AΣ in time during the rotation and motion of the Earth being
accompanied by the smooth variation of fundamental scales at an insigniﬁcant
value of the gradient ∂∆AΣ
∂x .

According to Refs.[5,6], ∆AΣ = 0 at full junction of quartzs in one region
of space, and hence the amplitude of the signal should not be changed. At
the maximum convergence of quartzs in the experiment, the amplitude of
the signal was halved in magnitude, which may be reasonably explained by
approximation of ∆AΣ to zero. Really two quartzs can by no means be brought
to a point.

Thus the analysis of the results of the experiment carried out shows, that the
signals of new nature were detected. These results, for the most part, cannot be
explained on a basis of commonly acknowledged standard physical views but
may be qualitatively interpreted with the aid of the byuon model of formation
of the surrounding physical space [5,6].

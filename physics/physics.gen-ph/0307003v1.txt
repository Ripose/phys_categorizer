Abstract

The new information-theoretic Process Physics provides an explanation of space as a
quantum foam system in which gravity is an inhomogeneous ﬂow of the quantum foam
into matter. The older Newtonian and General Relativity theories for gravity are anal-
ysed.
It is shown that Newtonian gravity may be written in the form of an in-ﬂow.
General Relativity is also analysed as an in-ﬂow, for those cases where it has been tested.
An analysis of various experimental data demonstrates that absolute motion relative to
space has been observed by Michelson and Morley, Miller, Illingworth, Jaseja et al, Torr
and Kolen, and by DeWitte. The Dayton Miller and Roland DeWitte data also reveal the
in-ﬂow of space into matter which manifests as gravity. The experimental data suggests
that the in-ﬂow is turbulent, which amounts to the observation of a gravitational wave
phenomena. A new in-ﬂow theory of gravity is proposed which passes all the tests that
General Relativity was claimed to have passed, but as well the new theory suggests that
the so-called spiral galaxy rotation-velocity anomaly may be explained without the need
of ‘dark matter’. Various other gravitational anomalies also appear to be explainable.
Newtonian gravity appears to be strictly valid only outside of spherically symmetric
matter systems.

Introduction

The new information-theoretic Process Physics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
provides for the ﬁrst time an explanation of space as a quantum foam system in which
gravity is an inhomogeneous ﬂow of the quantum foam into matter. An analysis [1, 2]
of data from various experiments demonstrates that absolute motion relative to space
has been observed by Michelson and Morley [14], Miller [15], Illingworth [16], Jaseja et
al [17], Torr and Kolen [18], and by DeWitte [19], contrary to common belief within
physics that absolute motion has never been observed. The Dayton Miller and Roland
DeWitte data also reveal the in-ﬂow of space into matter which manifests as gravity.
The experimental data suggests that the in-ﬂow manifest turbulence, which amounts to
the observation of a gravitational wave phenomena. The Einstein assumptions leading to
the Special and General Theory of Relativity are shown to be falsiﬁed by the extensive
experimental data.

Contrary to the Einstein assumptions absolute motion is consistent with relativistic
eﬀects, which are caused by actual dynamical eﬀects of absolute motion through the
quantum foam. Lorentzian relativity is seen to be essentially correct. Vacuum Michelson
interferometer experiments or its equivalent [20, 21, 22, 23, 24] cannot detect absolute
motion, though their null results are always incorrectly reported as evidence of an absence
of absolute motion.

A new in-ﬂow theory of gravity in the classical limit is proposed. It passes all the
standard tests of both the Newtonian and the General Relativity theories of gravity.
However it appears that this new theory may explain the spiral galaxy rotation-velocity
anomaly without invoking dark matter. As well this new theory is expected to predict
turbulent ﬂow, and such behaviour is manifest in the existing experimental observations
of absolute motion. Other gravitational anomalies also now appear to be capable of
being explained.

This paper is a condensed version of certain sections of Cahill [1].

2 A New Theory of Gravity

2.1 Classical Eﬀects of Quantum Foam

We begin here the analysis that will lead to the new theory and explanation of gravity.
In this theory gravitational eﬀects are caused solely by an inhomogeneous ﬂow of the
quantum foam. The new information-theoretic concepts underlying this physics were
discessed in [1, 3, 4]. Essentially matter eﬀectively acts as a ‘sink’ for that quantum
foam. To begin with it should be noted that even Newtonian gravity is suggestive of a
ﬂow explanation of gravity. In that theory the gravitational acceleration g is determined
by the matter density ρ according to

∇.g = −4πGρ.

(1)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

For ∇ × g = 0 this gravitational acceleration g may be written as the gradient of the
gravitational potential Φ

(2)
g = −∇Φ,
where the gravitational potential is now determined by ∇2Φ = 4πGρ. Here, as usual, G
is the gravitational constant. Now as ρ ≥ 0 we can choose to have Φ ≤ 0 everywhere if
Φ → 0 at inﬁnity. So we can introduce v2 = −2Φ ≥ 0 where v is some velocity vector
ﬁeld. Here the value of v2 is speciﬁed, but not the direction of v. Then

g =

∇(v

) = (v.∇)v + v × (∇ × v).

2

2

For irrotational ﬂow ∇ × v = 0. Then g is the usual Euler expression for the acceleration
of a ﬂuid element in a time-independent or stationary ﬂuid ﬂow.
If the ﬂow is time
dependent that expression is expected to become

This equation is then to be accompanied by the ‘Newtonian equation’ for the ﬂow ﬁeld

g = (v.∇)v + v × (∇ × v) +

∂v
∂t

.

∇

(v

) = −4πGρ.

While this hints at a ﬂuid ﬂow interpretation of Newtonian gravity the fact that the
direction of v is not speciﬁed by (5) suggests that some generalisation is to be expected
in which the direction of v is speciﬁed. Of course within the ﬂuid ﬂow interpretation
(4) and (5) are together equivalent to the Universal Inverse Square Law for Gravity.
Indeed for a spherically symmetric distribution of matter of total mass M the velocity
ﬁeld outside of the matter

satisﬁes (5) and reproduces the inverse square law form for g using (4):

v(r) = −

2GM
r

ˆr,

s

g = −

GM
r2 ˆr.

The in-ﬂow direction −ˆr in (6) may be replaced by any other direction, in which case
however the direction of g in (7) remains radial.

Of the many new eﬀects predicted by the generalisation of (5) one is that this ‘Inverse
Square Law’ is only valid outside of spherically symmetric matter systems. Then, for
example, the ‘Inverse Square Law’ is expected to be inapplicable to spiral galaxies. The
incorrect assumption of the universal validity of this law led to the notion of ‘dark matter’
in order to reconcile the faster observed rotation velocities of matter within such galaxies
compared to that predicted by the above law.

To arrive at the new in-ﬂow theory of gravity we require that the velocity ﬁeld v(r, t)
be speciﬁed and measurable with respect to a suitable frame of reference. We shall use
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) frame of reference for that purpose [25]. Then

an ‘object’ has velocity v0(t) = dr0(t)/dt with respect to that CMB frame, where r0(t)
is the position of the object wrt that frame. We then deﬁne

vR(t) = v0(t) − v(r0(t), t),

as the velocity of the object relative to the quantum foam at the location of the object.
Process Physics appears to be leading to the Lorentzian interpretation of so called
‘relativistic eﬀects’. This means that the speed of light is only ‘c’ wrt the quantum-
foam system, and that time dilation eﬀects for clocks and length contraction eﬀects for
rods are caused by the motion of clocks and rods relative to the quantum foam. So
these eﬀects are real dynamical eﬀects caused by the quantum foam, and are not to be
interpreted as spacetime eﬀects as suggested by Einstein. To arrive at the dynamical
description of the various eﬀects of the quantum foam we shall introduce conjectures
that essentially lead to a phenomenological description of these eﬀects. In the future we
expect to be able to derive this dynamics directly from the QHFT formalism. First we
shall conjecture that the path of an object through an inhomogeneous and time-varying
quantum-foam is determined by a variational principle, namely the path r0(t) minimises
the travel time (for early investigations of the in-ﬂow approach to gravity see Ives[26]
and Kirkwood[27, 28]),

an eﬀective ‘force’ caused by the inhomogeneities and time-variation of the ﬂow. This is
essentially Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion in the case of gravity only. That m0 cancels is
the equivalence principle, and which acquires a simple explanation in terms of the ﬂow.

which is the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form of the metric gµν [29, 30] for GR. All of the above is
very suggestive that useful information for the ﬂow dynamics may be obtained from GR
by restricting the choice of metric to the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form. We emphasize that the
absolute velocity vR has been measured, and so the foundations of GR as usually stated
are invalid. As we shall now see the GR formalism involves two phenomena, namely
(i) the use of an unnecessarily restrictive Einstein measurement protocol and (ii) the
Lorentzian quantum-foam dynamical eﬀects. Later we shall remove this measurement
protocol from GR and discover that the GR formalism reduces to explicit ﬂuid ﬂow
equations. One signiﬁcant implication of this is that the whole spacetime formalism
introduced by Einstein evaporates - it is nothing more than an epicycle eﬀect, that is,
like Ptolemy’s epicycles, it is an artifact and arises from not being aware of the inﬂuence
of certain features of a measurement procedure.

However to understand the GR formalism we need to explicitly introduce the trou-
blesome Einstein measurement protocol and the peculiar eﬀects that it induces in the
observers historical records, namely that they have a curved spacetime form. Again we
emphasize that experimentally this measurement protocol is unnecessarily restrictive -
one can do measurements of absolute motion, and then the curvature disappears.

2.2 The Einstein Measurement Protocol

The quantum foam, it is argued, induces actual dynamical time dilations and length
contractions in agreement with the Lorentz interpretation of special relativistic eﬀects.
Then observers in uniform motion ‘through’ the foam will on measurement of the speed
of light obtain always the same numerical value c. To see this explicitly consider how
various observers P, P ′, .. moving with diﬀerent speeds through the foam, measure the
speed of light. They each acquire a standard rod and an accompanying standardised
clock. That means that these standard rods would agree if they were brought together,
and at rest with respect to the quantum foam they would all have length ∆l0, and
similarly for the clocks. Observer P and accompanying rod are both moving at speed vR
relative to the quantum foam, with the rod longitudinal to that motion. P then measures
the time ∆tR, with the clock at end A of the rod, for a light pulse to travel from end
A to the other end B and back again to A. The light travels at speed c relative to the
quantum-foam. Let the time taken for the light pulse to travel from A → B be tAB and
from B → A be tBA, as measured by a clock at rest with respect to the quantum foam1.
The length of the rod moving at speed vR is contracted to

∆lR = ∆l0

c2 .

In moving from A to B the light must travel an extra distance because the end B travels
a distance vRtAB in this time, thus the total distance that must be traversed is

ctAB = ∆lR + vRtAB,
1Not all clocks will behave in this same ‘ideal’ manner.

(20)

Similarly on returning from B to A the light must travel the distance

Hence the total travel time ∆t0 is

ctBA = ∆lR − vRtBA.

Then for the moving observer the speed of light is deﬁned as the distance the observer
believes the light travelled (2∆l0) divided by the travel time according to the accompa-
nying clock (∆tR), namely 2∆l0/∆tR = c. So the speed vR of the observer through the
quantum foam is not revealed by this procedure, and the observer is erroneously led to
the conclusion that the speed of light is always c. This follows from two or more observers
in manifest relative motion all obtaining the same speed c by this procedure. Despite
this failure this special eﬀect is actually the basis of the spacetime Einstein measurement
protocol. That this protocol is blind to the absolute motion has led to enormous confu-
sion within physics. Later we shall see how to overcome the ‘blindness’ of this procedure,
and so manifestly reveal an observer’s vR.

To be explicit the Einstein measurement protocol actually inadvertently uses this
special eﬀect by using the radar method for assigning historical spacetime coordinates
to an event: the observer records the time of emission and reception of radar pulses
(tr > te) travelling through the space of quantum foam, and then retrospectively assigns
the time and distance of a distant event B according to (ignoring directional information
for simplicity)

TB =

(tr + te), DB =

where each observer is now using the same numerical value of c. The event B is then
plotted as a point in an individual geometrical construct by each observer, known as
a spacetime record, with coordinates (DB, TB). This is no diﬀerent to an historian
recording events according to some agreed protocol. Unlike historians, who don’t confuse
history books with reality, physicists do so. We now show that because of this protocol
and the quantum foam dynamical eﬀects, observers will discover on comparing their
historical records of the same events that the expression

so long as both are suﬃciently small compared with the scale of inhomogeneities in the
velocity ﬁeld.

To conﬁrm the invariant nature of the construct in (25) one must pay careful attention
to observational times as distinct from protocol times and distances, and this must be
done separately for each observer. This can be tedious. We now demonstrate this for
the situation illustrated in Fig.1.

While so far we have only established the invariance of the construct (25) when one
of the observers is at rest wrt to the quantum foam, it follows that for two observers
P ′ and P ′′ both in motion wrt the quantum foam it follows that they also agree on the
invariance of (25). This is easily seen by using the intermediate step of a stationary
observer P :

Hence the protocol and Lorentzian eﬀects result in the construction in (25) being indeed
an invariant in general. This is a remarkable and subtle result. For Einstein this in-
variance was a fundamental assumption, but here it is a derived result, but one which
is nevertheless deeply misleading. Explicitly indicating small quantities by ∆ preﬁxes,
and on comparing records retrospectively, an ensemble of nearby observers agree on the

for any two nearby events. This implies that their individual patches of spacetime records
may be mapped one into the other merely by a change of coordinates, and that collectively
the spacetime patches of all may be represented by one pseudo-Riemannian manifold,
where the choice of coordinates for this manifold is arbitrary, and we ﬁnally arrive at the

2.3 The Origins of General Relativity

Above it was seen that the Lorentz symmetry of the spacetime construct would arise if the
quantum foam system that forms space aﬀects the rods and clocks used by observers in
the manner indicated. The eﬀects of absolute motion with respect to this quantum foam
are in fact easily observed, and so the velocity vR of each observer is measurable. However
if we work only with the spacetime construct then the eﬀects of the absolute motion are
hidden. Einstein was very much misled by the reporting of the experiment by Michelson
and Morley of 1887, as now (see later) it is apparent that this experiment, and others
since then, revealed evidence of absolute motion. The inﬂuence of the Michelson-Morley
experiment had a major eﬀect on the subsequent development of physics. One such
development was the work of Hilbert and Einstein in ﬁnding an apparent generalisation
of Newtonian gravity to take into account the apparent absence of absolute motion.
Despite the deep error in this work the ﬁnal formulation, known as General Relativity,
has had a number of successes including the perihelion precession of mercury, the bending
of light and gravitational red shift. Hence despite the incorrect treatment of absolute

In the next
motion the formalism of general relativity apparently has some validity.
section we shall deconstruct this formalism to discover its underlying physics, but here
we ﬁrst brieﬂy outline the GR formalism.

The spacetime construct is a static geometrical non-processing historical record, and
is nothing more than a very reﬁned history book, with the shape of the manifold encoded
in a metric tensor gµν (x). However in a formal treatment by Einstein the SR formalism
and later the GR formalism is seen to arise from three fundamental assumptions:

(1) The laws of physics have the same form in all inertial

reference frames.

(2) Light propagates through empty space with a deﬁnite

speed c independent of the speed of the source or observer.

(3)

In the limit of low speeds the new formalism should

agree with Newtonian gravity.

(30)

There is strong evidence that all three of these assumptions are in fact wrong, see
[1, 2]. Nevertheless there is something that is partially correct within the formalism,
and that part needs to be extracted and saved, with the rest discarded. From the above
assumptions Hilbert and Einstein guessed the equation which specify the metric tensor
gµν (x), namely the geometry of the spacetime construct,

which is exactly the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form of the metric gµν [29, 30] in (17) with the
velocity ﬁeld given exactly by the Newtonian form in (6). In which case the trajectory
equation (34) of test objects in the Schwarzschild metric is equivalent to solving (14).
Thus the minimisation (35) is equivalent to that of (9). This choice of coordinates
corresponds to a particular frame of reference in which the test object has velocity vR =
v − v0 relative to the in-ﬂow ﬁeld v, as seen in (9).

It is conventional wisdom for practitioners in General Relativity to regard the choice
of coordinates or frame of reference to be entirely arbitrary and having no physical
signiﬁcance: no observations should be possible that can detect and measure vR. This
‘wisdom’ is based on two beliefs (i) that all attempts to detect vR, namely the detection of
absolute motion, have failed, and that (ii) the existence of absolute motion is incompatible
with the many successes of both the Special Theory of Relativity and of the General
Theory of Relativity. Both of these beliefs are demonstrably false.

The results in this section suggest, just as for Newtonian gravity, that the Einstein
General Relativity is nothing more than the dynamical equations for a velocity ﬂow ﬁeld
v(r, t). Hence the non-ﬂat spacetime construct appears to be merely an unnecessary
artifact of the Einstein measurement protocol, which in turn was motivated by the mis-
reporting of the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment. The successes of General
Relativity should thus be considered as an insight into the ﬂuid ﬂow dynamics of the
quantum foam system, rather than any conﬁrmation of the validity of the spacetime

formalism.
possible form for this dynamics.

2.4 Deconstruction of General Relativity

Here we deconstruct the formalism of General Relativity by removing the obscuriﬁcation
produced by the unnecessarily restricted Einstein measurement protocol. To do this
we adopt the Panlev´e-Gullstrand form of the metric gµν as that corresponding to the
observable quantum foam system, namely to an observationally detected special frame
of reference. This form for the metric involves a general velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) where for
precision we consider the coordinates r, t as that of observers at rest with respect to the
CMB frame. Note that in this frame v(r, t) is not necessarily zero, for mass acts as a
sink for the ﬂow. We therefore merely substitute the metric

into (31) using (33) and (32). This metric involves the arbitrary time-dependent velocity
ﬁeld v(r, t). This is a very tedious computation and the results below were obtained by
using the symbolic mathematics capabilities of Mathematica. The various components

In vacuum, with Tµν = 0, we ﬁnd from (31) and (40) that Gµν = 0 implies that Gµν = 0.
It is then easy to check that the in-ﬂow velocity ﬁeld (6) satisﬁes these equations. This

simply expresses the previous observation that this ‘Newtonian in-ﬂow’ is completely
equivalent to the Schwarzschild metric. We note that the vacuum equations Gµν = 0
do not involve the speed of light; it appears only in (40). It is therefore suggested that
(40) amounts to the separation of the Einstein measurement protocol, which involves c,
from the supposed dynamics of gravity within the GR formalism, and which does not
involve c. However the details of the vacuum dynamics in (41) have not actually been
tested. All the key tests of GR are now seen to amount to a test only of δτ [x]/δxµ = 0,
which is the minimisation of (9), when the in-ﬂow ﬁeld is given by (40), and which is
nothing more than Newtonian gravity. Of course Newtonian gravity was itself merely
based upon observations within the Solar system, and this may have been too special to
have revealed key aspects of gravity. Hence, despite popular opinion, the GR formalism
is apparently based upon rather poor evidence.

2.5 Gravity as Inhomogeneous Quantum-Foam Flow

Despite the limited insight into gravity which GR is now seen to amount to, here we
look for possible generalisations of Newtonian gravity and its in-ﬂow interpretation by
examining some of the mathematical structures that have arisen in (41). For the case
of zero vorticity ∇ × v = 0 we have Ωij = 0 and also that we may write v = ∇u where
u(r, t) is a scalar ﬁeld, and only one equation is required to determine u. To that end we
consider the trace of Gij. Note that tr(D) = ∇.v, and that

d(∇.v)

= (v.∇)(∇.v) +

This is seen to be a possible generalisation of the Newtonian equation (5) that includes
a time derivative, and also the new term C(v) = 1
4 ((trD)2 − tr(D2)). First note that
for the case of the Solar system, with the mass concentrated in one object, namely
the Sun, we see that the in-ﬂow ﬁeld (6) satisﬁes (47) since then C(v) = 0. As we
shall see later the presence of the C term is also well hidden when we consider the
Earth’s gravitational eﬀects, although there are various known anomalies that indicate
that a generalisation of Newtonian gravity is required. Hence (47) in the case of the
Solar system is indistinguishable from Newtonian gravity, or the Schwarzschild metric
within the General Relativity formalism so long as we use (9), in being able to determine

16

(48)

(49)

(50)

trajectories of test objects. Hence (47) is automatically in agreement with most of the so-
called checks on Newtonian gravity and later General Relativity. Note that (47) does not
involve the speed of light c. Nevertheless we have not derived (47)) from the underlying
QHFT, and indeed it is not a consequence of GR, as the G00 equation of (41) requires that
C(v) = 0 in vacuum. Eqn.(47) at this stage should be regarded as a conjecture which
will permit the exploration of possible quantum-ﬂow physics and also allow comparison
with experiment.

However one key aspect of (47) should be noted here, namely that being a non-linear
ﬂuid-ﬂow dynamical system we would expect the ﬂow to be turbulent, particularly when
the matter is not spherically symmetric or inside even a spherically symmetric distribu-
tion of matter, since then the C(v) term is non-zero and it will drive that turbulence.
In the following sections we shall see that the experiments that reveal absolute motion
also reveal evidence of turbulence.

Because of the C(v) term (47) would predict that the Newtonian inverse square
law would not be applicable to systems such as spiral galaxies, because of their highly
non-spherical distribution of matter. Of course attempts to retain this law, despite its
manifest failure, has led to the spurious introduction of the notion of dark matter within
spiral galaxies, and also at larger scales. From

which is (4) for irrotational ﬂow, we see that (47) gives

g =

∇(v

) +

2

1
2

∂v
∂t

,

∇.g = −4πGρ − C(v),

and taking running time averages to account for turbulence

∇.<g>= −4πGρ− <C(v)>,

and writing the extra term as <C(v)>= 4πGρDM we see that ρDM would act as an
eﬀective matter density, and it is suggested that it is the consequences of this term which
have been misinterpreted as ‘dark matter’. Here we see that this eﬀect is actually the
consequence of quantum foam eﬀects within the new proposed dynamics for gravity, and
which becomes apparent particularly in spiral galaxies. Note that (47) is an equation for
v, and now involves the direction of v, unlike the special case of Newtonian gravity (5).
Because ∇ × v = 0 we can write (47) in the form

(51)

which allows the determination of the time evolution of v.

The new ﬂow dynamics encompassed in (47) thus accounts for most of the known
gravitational phenomena, but will lead to some very clear cut experiments that will dis-
tinguish it from the two previous attempts to model gravitation. It turns out that these
two attempts were based on some key ‘accidents’ of history. In the case of the Newtonian

17

modelling of gravity the prime ‘accident’ was of course the Solar system with its high de-
gree of spherical symmetry. In each case we had test objects, namely the planets, in orbit
about the Sun, or we had test object in orbit about the Earth. In the case of the General
Relativity modelling the prime ‘accident’ was the mis-reporting of the Michelson-Morley
experiment, and the ongoing belief that the so called ‘relativistic eﬀects’ are incompati-
ble with absolute motion. We shall consider in detail later some further anomalies that
might be appropriately explained by this new modelling of gravity. Of course that the
in-ﬂow has been present in various experimental data is also a signiﬁcant argument for
something like (47) to model gravity. Key new experimental techniques will be intro-
duced later which wil enable the consequences of (47) to be tested. If necessary these
experiments will provide insights into possible modiﬁcations to (47).

2.6

In-Flow Superposition Approximation

We consider here why the presence of the C(v) term appears to have escaped attention
in the case of gravitational experiments and observations near the Earth, despite the fact
that the presence of the Earth breaks the spherical symmetry of the matter distribution
of the Sun.

First note that if we have a matter distribution at rest in the space of quantum foam,
and that (47) has solution v0(r, t), then when the same matter distribution is uniformly
translating at velocity V, that is ρ(r) → ρ(r − Vt), then a solution to (47) is

v(r, t) = v0(r − Vt) + V.

(52)

This follows because (i) the expression for the acceleration g(r, t) gives

g(r, t) =

+ ((v0(r − Vt) + V).∇)(v0(r − Vt) + V),

=

+ g0(r − Vt) + (V.∇)v0(r − Vt),

= −(V.∇)v0(r − Vt) + g0(r − Vt) + (V.∇)v0(r − Vt),

∂v0(r − Vt)
∂t
∂v0(r − Vt)
∂t

= g0(r − Vt),

(53)

as there is a cancellation of two terms in (53), and where g0(r) is the acceleration
ﬁeld when the matter distribution is not in translation, and (ii) clearly C(v0(r − Vt) +
V) = C(v0(r − Vt)), and so this term is also simply translated. Hence apart from the
translation eﬀect the acceleration is the same. Hence the velocity vector addition rule in
(52) is valid.

Now for Earth based gravitational phenomena the motion of the Earth takes place
within the velocity in-ﬂow towards the Sun, and the velocity sum rule (52) is only ap-
proximately valid as now V → V(r, t) and no longer corresponds to uniform translation,
and may manifest turbulence. To be a valid approximation the inhomogeneity of V(r, t)
must be much smaller than that of v0(r − Vt), which it is4. Nevertheless turbulence
4The Earth’s centripetal acceleration about the Sun is approximately 1/1000 that of the

gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth.

18

associated with the C(v) term is apparent in experimental data. The validity of this ap-
proximation plays a special role in explaining why the entrainment hypotheses regarding
the detection of Earth’s absolute motion was unnecessary.

2.7 Measurements of G

As noted in Sect.2.1 Newton’s Inverse Square Law of Gravitation may only be strictly
valid in cases of spherical symmetry. The theory that gravitational eﬀects arise from
inhomogeneities in the quantum foam ﬂow implies that there is no ‘universal law of
gravitation’ because the inhomogeneities are determined by non-linear ‘ﬂuid equations’
and the solutions have no form which could be described by a ‘universal law’. Funda-
mentally there is no generic ﬂuid ﬂow behaviour. The Inverse Square Law is then only an
approximation, with large deviations expected in the case of spiral galaxies. Nevertheless
Newton’s gravitational constant G will have a deﬁnite value as it quantiﬁes the eﬀective
rate at which matter dissipates the information content of space.

From these considerations it follows that the measurement of the value of G will be
diﬃcult as the measurement of the forces between two of more objects, which is the usual
method of measuring G, will depend on the geometry of the spatial positioning of these
objects in a way not previously accounted for because the Newtonian Inverse Square Law
has always been assumed, or in some case a speciﬁed change in the form of the law has
been used. But in all cases a ‘law’ has been assumed, and this may have been the ﬂaw
in the analysis of data from such experiments. This implies that the value of G from
such experiments will show some variability as a systematic eﬀect has been neglected in
analysing the experimental data, for in none of these experiments is spherical symmetry
present. So experimental measurements of G should show an unexpected contextuality.
As well the inﬂuence of surrounding matter has also not been properly accounted for. Of
course any eﬀects of turbulence in the inhomogeneities of the ﬂow has presumably never
even been contemplated.

The ﬁrst measurement of G was in 1798 by Cavendish using a torsional balance. As
the precision of experiments increased over the years and a variety of techniques used the
disparity between the values of G has actually increased. In 1998 CODATA increased
the uncertainty in G from 0.013% to 0.15%. One indication of the contextuality is that
measurements of G produce values that diﬀer by nearly 40 times their individual error
estimates [32]. It is predicted that these G anomalies will only be resolved when the new
theory of gravity is used in analysing the data from these experiments.

2.8 Gravitational Anomalies

In Sect.2.7 anomalies associated with the measurement of G were brieﬂy discussed and
it was pointed out that these were probably explainable within the new in-ﬂow theory of
gravity. There are in-fact additional gravitational anomalies that are not well-known in
physics, presumably because their existence is incompatible with the Newtonian or the
Hilbert-Einstein gravity theories.

19

The most signiﬁcant of these anomalies is the Allais eﬀect [33]. In June 1954 Allais5
reported that a Foucault pendulum exhibited peculiar movements at the time of a solar
eclipse. Allais was recording the precession of a Foucault pendulum in Paris. Coinci-
dently during the 30 day observation period a partial solar eclipse occured at Paris on
June 30. During the eclipse the precession of the pendulum was seen to be disturbed.
Similar results were obtained during another solar eclipse on October 29 1959. There
have been other repeats of the Allais experiment with varying results.

Another anomaly was reported by Saxl and Allen [34] during the solar eclipse of
March 7 1970. Signiﬁcant variations in the period of a torsional pendulum were observed
both during the eclipse and as well in the hours just preceding and just following the
eclipse. The eﬀects seem to suggest that an “apparent wavelike structure has been
observed over the course of many years at our Harvard laboratory”, where the wavelike
structure is present and reproducible even in the absence of an eclipse.

Again Zhou and Huang [35] report various time anomalies occuring during the solar
eclipses of Sepetmber 23 1987, March 18 1988 and July 22 1990 observed using atomic
clocks.

All these anomalies and others not discussed here would suggest that gravity has
aspects to it that are not within the prevailing theories, but that the in-ﬂow theory
discussed above might well provide an explanation, and indeed these anomalies may
well provide further phenomena that could be used to test the new theory. The eﬀects
associated with the solar eclipses could presumably follow from the alignment of the Sun,
Moon and the Earth causing enhanced turbulence. The Saxl and Allen experiment of
course suggests, like the other experiments analysed above, that the turbulence is always
present. To explore these anomalies detailed numerical studies of (47) are required with
particular emphasis on the eﬀect on the position of the Moon.

2.9 Galactic In-ﬂow and the CMB Frame

Absolute motion (AM) of the Solar system has been observed in the direction (α =
17.5h, δ = 650), up to an overall sign to be sorted out, with a speed of 417 ± 40 km/s [1].
This is the velocity after removing the contribution of the Earth’s orbital speed and the
Sun in-ﬂow eﬀect. It is signiﬁcant that this velocity is diﬀerent to that associated with the
Cosmic Microwave Background 6 (CMB) relative to which the Solar system has a speed
of 369 km/s in the direction (α = 11.20h, δ = −7.220), see [25]. This CMB velocity
is obtained by ﬁnding the preferred frame in which this thermalised 30K radiation is
isotropic, that is by removing the dipole component. The CMB velocity is a measure

5Maurice Allais won the Noble Prize for Economics in 1988.
6The understanding of the galactic in-ﬂow eﬀect was not immediate: In [9] the direction was
not determined, though the speed was found to be comparable to the CMB determined speed.
In [10] that the directions were very diﬀerent was noted but not appreciated, and in fact thought
to be due to experimental error. In [11] an analysis of some of the ‘smoother’ Michelson-Morley
data resulted in an incorrect direction. At that stage it was not understood that the data showed
large ﬂuctuations in the azimuth apparently caused by the turbulence. Here the issue is hopefully
ﬁnally resolved.

20

of the motion of the Solar system relative to the universe as a whole, or aleast a shell
of the universe some 15Gyrs away, and indeed the near uniformity of that radiation in
all directions demonstrates that we may meaningfully refer to the spatial structure of
the universe. The concept here is that at the time of decoupling of this radiation from
matter that matter was on the whole, apart from small observable ﬂuctuations, at rest
with respect to the quantum-foam system that is space. So the CMB velocity is the
motion of the Solar system with respect to space universally, but not necessarily with
respect to the local space. Contributions to this velocity would arise from the orbital
motion of the Solar system within the Milky Way galaxy, which has a speed of some 250
km/s, and contributions from the motion of the Milky Way within the local cluster, and
so on to perhaps larger clusters.

On the other hand the AM velocity is a vector sum of this universal CMB velocity
and the net velocity associated with the local gravitational in-ﬂows into the Milky Way
and the local cluster. If the CMB velocity had been identical to the AM velocity then the
in-ﬂow interpretation of gravity would have been proven wrong. We therefore have three
pieces of experimental evidence for this interpretation (i) the refractive index anomaly
discussed previously in connection with the Miller data, (ii) the turbulence seen in all
detections of absolute motion, and now (iii) that the AM velocity is diﬀerent in both
magnitude and direction from that of the CMB velocity, and that this velocity does not
display the turbulence seen in the AM velocity.

That the AM and CMB velocities are diﬀerent amounts to the discovery of the
resolution to the ‘dark matter’ conjecture. Rather than the galactic velocity anomalies
being caused by such undiscovered ‘dark matter’ we see that the in-ﬂow into non spherical
galaxies, such as the spiral Milky Way, will be non-Newtonian [1]. As well it will be
interesting to determine, at least theoretically, the scale of turbulence expected in galactic
systems, particularly as the magnitude of the turbulence seen in the AM velocity is
somewhat larger than might be expected from the Sun in-ﬂow alone. Any theory for the
turbulence eﬀect will certainly be checkable within the Solar system as the time scale of
this is suitable for detailed observation.

It is also clear that the time of obervers at rest with respect to the CMB frame is
absolute or universal time. This interpretation of the CMB frame has of course always
been rejected by supporters of the SR/GR formalism. As for space we note that it has a
diﬀerential structure, in that diﬀerent regions are in relative motion. This is caused by
the gravitational in-ﬂow eﬀect locally, and as well by the growth of the universe.

2.10

In-Flow Turbulence and Gravitational Waves

The velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld equation (47) is expected to have solutions possessing turbulence,
that is, random ﬂuctuations in both the magnitude and direction of the gravitational
in-ﬂow component of the velocity ﬂow-ﬁeld.
Indeed all the Michelson interferometer
experiments showed evidence of such turbulence. The ﬁrst clear evidence was from the
Miller experiment, as shown discussed in [1]. Miller oﬀered no explanation for these
ﬂuctuations but in his analysis of that data he did running time averages. Miller may
have in fact have simply interpreted these ﬂuctuations as purely instrumental eﬀects.

21

While some of these ﬂuctuations may be partially caused by weather related temperature
and pressure variations, the bulk of the ﬂuctuations appear to be larger than expected
from that cause alone. Even the original Michelson-Morley data, plotted in [1] shows
variations in the velocity ﬁeld and supports this interpretation. However it is signiﬁcant
that the non-interferometer DeWitte [1] data also shows evidence of turbulence in both
the magnitude and direction of the velocity ﬂow ﬁeld. Just as the DeWitte data agrees
with the Miller data for speeds and directions the magnitude ﬂuctuations are very similar
in absolute magnitude as well.

It therefore becomes clear that there is strong evidence for these ﬂuctuations being
evidence of physical turbulence in the ﬂow ﬁeld. The magnitude of this turbulence ap-
pears to be somewhat larger than that which would be caused by the in-ﬂow of quantum
foam towards the Sun, and indeed following on from Sect.2.9 some of this turbulence
may be associated with galactic in-ﬂow into the Milky Way. This in-ﬂow turbulence is
a form of gravitational wave and the ability of gas-mode Michelson interferometers to
detect absolute motion means that experimental evidence of such a wave phenomena has
been available for a considerable period of time, but suppressed along with the detection
of absolute motion itself. Of course ﬂow equations do not exhibit those gravitational
waves of the form that have been predicted to exist based on the Einstein equations, and
which are supposed to propagate at the speed of light. All this means that gravitational
wave phenomena is very easy to detect and amounts to new physics that can be studied
in much detail, particularly using the new 1st-order interferometer discussed in [1].

2.11 Absolute Motion and Quantum Gravity

Absolute rotational motion had been recognised as a meaningful and obervable phenom-
ena from the very beginning of physics. Newton had used his rotating bucket experiment
to illustrate the reality of absolute rotational motion, and later Foucault and Sagnac pro-
vided further experimental proof. But for absolute linear motion the history would turm
out to be completely diﬀerent. It was generally thought that absolute linear motion was
undetectable, at least until Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory appeared to require it. In
perhaps the most bizarre sequence of events in modern science it turns out that absolute
linear motion has been apparent within experimental data for over 100 years.
It was
missed in the ﬁrst experiment designed to detect it and from then on for a variety of
sociological reasons it became a concept rejected by physicists and banned from their
journals despite continuing new experimental evidence. Those who pursued the scientiﬁc
evidence were treated with scorn and ridicule. Even worse was the impasse that this
obstruction of the scientiﬁc process resulted in, namely the halting of nearly all progress
in furthering our understanding of the phenomena of gravity. For it is clear from all
the experiments that were capable of detecting absolute motion that there is present in
that data evidence of turbulence within the velocity ﬁeld. Both the in-ﬂow itself and the
turbulence are manifestations at a classical level of what is essentially quantum gravity
processes.

Process Physics has given a uniﬁcation of explanation and description of physical
phenomena based upon the limitations of formal syntactical systems which had never-

22

theless achieved a remarkable encapsulation of many phenomena, albeit in a disjointed
and confused manner, and with a dysfunctional ontology attached for good measure. As
argued in [1, 2] space is a quantum system continually classicalised by on-going non-local
collapse processes. The emergent phenomena is foundational to existence and experien-
tialism. Gravity in this system is caused by diﬀerences in the rate of processing of the
cellular information within the network which we experience as space, and consequen-
tially there is a diﬀerential ﬂow of information which can be aﬀected by the presence of
matter or even by space itself. Of course the motion of matter including photons with
respect to that spatial information content is detectable because it aﬀects the geometri-
cal and chronological attributes of that matter, and the experimental evidence for this
has been exhaustively discussed in [1, 2]. What has become very clear is that the phe-
nomena of gravity is only understandable once we have this uniﬁcation of the quantum
phenomena of matter and the quantum phenomena of space itself. In Process Physics the
diﬀerence between matter and space is subtle. It comes down to the diﬀerence between
informational patterns that are topologically preserved and those information patterns
that are not. One outcome of this uniﬁcation is that as a consequence of having a quan-
tum phenomena of space itself we obtain an informational explanation for gravity, and
which at a suitable level has an emergent quantum description. In this sense we have an
emergent quantum theory of gravity. Of course no such quantum description of gravity
is derivable from quantising Einsteinian gravity itself. This follows on two counts, one
is that the Einstein gravity formalism fails on several levels, as discussed previously, and
second that quantisation has no validity as a means of uncovering deeper physics. Most
surprising of all is that having uncovered the logical necessity for gravitational phenom-
ena it also appears that even the seemingly well-founded Newtonian account of gravity
has major failings. The denial of this possibility has resulted in an unproductive search
for dark matter. Indeed like dark matter and spacetime much of present day physics has
all the hallmarks of another episode of Ptolemy’s epicycles, namely concepts that appear
to be well founded but in the end turn out to be illusions, and ones that have acquired
the status of dogma.

If the Michelson-Morley experiment had been properly analysed and the phenomena
revealed by the data exposed, and this would have required in 1887 that Newtonian
physics be altered, then as well as the subsequent path of physics being very diﬀerent,
physicists would almost certainly have discovered both the gravitational in-ﬂow eﬀect
and associated turbulence.

It is clear then that observation and measurement of absolute motion leads directly to
a changed paradigm regarding the nature and manifestations of gravitational phenomena,
and that the new 1st-order interferometer described in [1] will provide an extremely
simple device to uncover aspects of gravity previously denied by current physics. There
are two aspects of such an experimental program. One is the characterisation of the
turbulence and its linking to the new non-linear term in the velocity ﬁeld theory. This is
a top down program. The second aspect is a bottom-up approach where the form of the
velocity ﬁeld theory, or its modiﬁcation, is derived from the deeper informational process
physics. This is essentially the quantum gravity route. The turbulence is of course
essentially a gravitational wave phenomena and networks of 1st-order interferometers

will permit spatial and time series analysis. There are a number of other gravitational
anomalies which may also now be studied using such an interferometer network, and so
much new physics can be expected to be uncovered.

3 Conclusions

It passes all the key existing tests,
Here a new theory of gravity has been proposed.
and also appears to be capable of explaining numerous gravitational anomalies. The
phenomena present in these anomalies provide opportunities for further tests of the new
gravitational physics. This new theory is supported by the Miller abolute motion experi-
ment in that it reveals the turbulent in-ﬂow of space associated with gravity, as well as the
existence of absolute motion itself. This clearly refutes the fundamental postulates of the
Einstein reinterpretation of the relativitsic eﬀects that had been developed by Lorentz
and others. Indeed these experiments are consistent with the Lorentzian relativity in
which reality displays both absolute motion eﬀects and relativistic eﬀects. As discussed
in detail in [1] it is absolute motion that actually causes these relativistic eﬀects. Both
General Relativity and the Newtonian theory, for which GR was constructed to agree
with in the low speed limit, are refuted by these experiments. These developments are
discussed more extensively in [1]. As well the dynamical structure of stars needs to be
reexamined in the light of this new theory, and this may have some relevance to the
neutrino ﬂux problem.

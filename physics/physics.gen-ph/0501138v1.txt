6-dimensional Kaluza-Klein Theory for Basic Quantum Particles and Electron-Photon
Interaction

Xiaodong Chen∗
(Dated: February 20, 2014)

By extending original Kaluza-Klein theory to 6-dimension, the basic quantum ﬁeld equations
for 0-spin particle, 1-spin particle and 1/2 spin particle with mass >0 are directly derived from 6-
dimensional Einstein equations. It shows that the current quantum ﬁeld equations of basic particles
become pure geometry properties under 6-dimension time-space. The ﬁeld equations of electron and
photon can be uniﬁed in one 6-dimensional extended Maxwell equation. The equations containing
interactions between electron and photon will be derived from Einstein equation under 6-dimension
time-space. It shows that the interactions in QED can be considered as the eﬀect of local geometry
curvature changing instead of exchange virtual photons.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Kaluza [1] ﬁrst developed his method in 1919 in an at-
tempt to unify Electromagnetism and General Relativity.
In fact, Kaluza’s idea showed the possibility to unify not
only gravity and electromagnetism, but also matter and
geometry [2].
It gave physicists the hope of extending
Einstein’s vision of nature as pure geometry to quantum
level. The original Kaluza metric can be written as fol-
lows:

(1)

−

(ˆgAB) =

gαβ

φAαAβ
φAβ

−
−

(cid:18)

φAα

where the αβ-part of ˆgAB with gαβ (the four-dimensional
metric tensor), the α4-part with Aα (the electromagnetic
potential), and the 44-part with φ (a scalar ﬁeld). The
four-dimensional metric signature is taken to be (+

)

− −

The metric above contains a massless scalar ﬁeld and
a massless 1-spin vector ﬁeld. The method did not in-
clude the mass part of quantum ﬁeld (although people
believes that the metric (1) describe a spin-2 graviton,
a spin-1 photon and a spin-0 boson which is thought to
be connected with how particles acquire mass.); it also
can not be used to describe the particle with half integer
spin. To completely extend Einstein’s vision of nature (as
pure geometry) to quantum level, we need include quan-
tum ﬁelds for particles of mass > 0, and the particles of 1
2
spin into the theory. In other eﬀorts, a possible “theory of
everything”– Superstring theory extended Kaluza’s idea
to ten-dimension, which contains all kinds of ﬁelds. But
superstring theory is much complicate, it lost the beauty
of simplicity in original Kaluza-Klein theory.

In this paper, one will ﬁnd that by extending Kaluza-
Klein theory to 6-dimension time-space, the ﬁeld equa-
tions of 0-spin particle with mass > 0 (Klein-Gordon

equation), equations of 1-spin particle with mass > 0
and equations of half integer spin particle (Dirac equa-
tion) can be derived directly from 6-dimensional Ein-
stein equations under new 6-dimensional metric, espe-
cially the equations of electron and photon can be uniﬁed
in one 6-dimensional Maxwell equation when we expand
the components of ﬁelds of electron and photon to 6-
dimension. It indicates that the current quantum ﬁeld
equations of basic particles are pure geometry properties
of 6-dimension time-space. The coupling equations be-
tween electron and photon will be obtained from Einstein
equation under 6-dimension time-space.
It shows that
the interactions in QED can be considered as the eﬀect
of local geometry curvature changing instead of exchange
virtual photons.

now we will see that if we let ˆA5 <> 0, we will get ﬁeld

so the AB-, A4-, and 44-components of 6-dimensional

For free particle, it is reasonable to assume that each

components of ˆK satisﬁed plane-wave condition:

∂C∂C ˆKA = 0

(26)

The second equation of equations (24) become

i.e. ∂C ˆKC does not depended on x0, x1, x2, x3, x5, so it
is reasonable to let ∂C ˆKC equals zero (Not likely equals
a constant other than zero becaues ˆK contains a plane-
wave function part of condition (26)). Together with the
third equation of equations (24), we have

∂C ˆKC = 0 ,

ˆEAB ˆEAB = 0

where C is constant to be determined, gαα is element of

equation of (28) becomes

∂0φ0 + ∂1φ3 −

i∂2φ3 + ∂3φ2 + im0φ0 = 0

(30)

It is ﬁrst Dirac equation in x3 representation. The two
equations in (28) plus normalization condition of φ0, φ2,
φ3 keep the solution unique, plus we need choose constant
C to make the energy momentum tensor ˆTAB reasonable.

sion, equations (24) is general ﬁeld equations for parti-

then the above equation (35) turns into Maxwell equa-
tion. So 1-spin particle (both massless and mass > 0), 1

spin particle are satisﬁed the same equations – extended
6-dimensional Maxwell equation (35) in 6-dimensional
time-space. The ﬁeld of 1

V. EQUATIONS OF ELECTRON-PHOTON

The similarity between the metric of single electron
and the metric of single photon makes us easier to com-
bine eletron and photon into one metric, The metric ˆgAB
of the coupling of electron-photon is:

dimension) which we deﬁned in previous section for elec-
tron. κ is constant for coupling with gravity; κ = 4√πG
where G is gravational constant. To describe interactions
between electron and photon, we impliment Klein’s idea
[4] to make the derivative of 5th dimension <> 0 , we
can understand that in two ways: 1) the interaction of
Electron-Photon changed curvature of local time-space.
2) An Electron always associate with electromagnetic
ﬁelds which cause non-zero derivative of 5th dimension.
Let

where γ is a very small constant, n is integer, and there

i(∂2 + ieA2)φ3

+(∂3 + ieA3)φ2 + im0φ0 = 0 (41)

This is Dirac equation for electron-photon interaction.
The second equation of (39) is Klein-Gordon equation in
electromagnetic ﬁeld that each components of electron
ﬁeld should satisﬁed individually. The 3rd equation of
(39) is Maxwell equation.

Now let’s look at energy momentum tensor (40). The
ﬁrst two parts are combined energy momentum tensor
of electron and photon. The third item ie ˆBB ˆK C FAC is
related to Lorenz force. The third item is electric current
density.

duces in the simple manner:

VI. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

The kinetic energy part of (44) 1

ˆLAB ˆLAB contains the
combination of electron ﬁeld and photon ﬁeld. Actually,
metric (36) can be used to describe:

1) Eletron associate with its own static electromagnetic
ﬁeld. Eletron is always accompany with photon (static
electromagnetic ﬁelds), that’s why it can absort photon
to gain energy, emits phton and lost energy, annihilation
with positron and turns into two photons, so it is rea-
sonable to say that there is always Aα ﬁeld in electron’s
local geometry metric.

2) Electron absorb a photon and gains energy.

If a
free photon A0 at time t0, location X(x01, x02, x03) which
local geometry metric is (16), it is absorted by an electron
at time t, then the local metric at time t becomes metric
(36) with ˆB′ = A′
0 + Ae + ˆK, where photon A0 turns to
A′
0 after interaction and Ae is initial photon contained in
electron, and ﬁnally electron gain the energy.

3) The intermediate state of a photon interacts with
electron.
location
If a free photon A0 at time t0,
X(x01, x02, x03) which local geometry metric is (16), it
interacts with electron at time t, then the local metric
at time t becomes metric (36) with ˆB′ = A′
0 + Ae + ˆK,
after interaction, the photon and electron will be sepa-
rate. Of couse the energy and momentum of both particle
changed.

In the discussion above, we only dealing with curvature

changes. We do not need use any “virtual” photons.

In addition, here we see a symmetry between gravity
and electromagnetism: Mass is the source of gravity, it
comes from the derivative of 6th dimension; Charge is
the source of electromagnetic interaction, it comes from
the derivative of 5th dimension. We can also use Klein’s
original idea that, the 5th and 6th have circular topology
and periodic conditions, that can make quantization of

electric charge and quantization of mass (or energy).

As the conclusion, in this paper, we derived above
equations directly from Einstein equations under 6-
dimensional time-space metric. The energy momentum
tensor is the products of extended 6-dimensional momen-
tum vector pA (where p5 = m0, p4 = 0, no 5 dimen-
sional momentum); Planck constant ~ plays the similar
role as the role of gravational constant G in gravity equa-
tions. The interactions between photon and electron can
be treated as the eﬀects of local time-space geometry
curvature changing. It indicates the pure geometry na-
ture of quantum ﬁelds. Indeed, by using metric (4), one
can ﬁnd that the geodesic path of single free particle in
6-dimensional time-space is exact plane-wave function,
the interpretion of basic quantum physics by using 6-
dimensional time-space is discussed in another paper [3].

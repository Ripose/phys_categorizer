Gravitation from electrodynamics

Abstract.
Maxwell’s equations and the Einstein equation are derived from vari-
ation of the new action for the locally paired cone-particle and cone-
ﬁeld emitted by the same point source. The electrodynamic references
make Einstein’s relativity a self-contained theory, which independently
reproduces Machian mechanics in its nonrelativistic limit. Becoming
free from the Newtonian references, general relativity explains the mea-
sured gravitational phenomena in ﬂat three-space, overcomes the con-
ventional diﬃculties for electromagnetic origin of gravitation, and leads
to the gauge-invariant electrogravity. Laboratory tests might be used
to verify the proposed covariant uniﬁcation with the electromagnetic
dilation and compression of time.

1. Introduction

Covariant equations for matter were originally derived for independent carri-
ers of mass and charge [1]. But one elementary object N can carry both electric,
qN , and gravitomechanical (mass), mN , charges. Gravity or acceleration can
lead, for example, to a separation of opposite electric charges within an elec-
troneutral medium with free electrons [2,3]. The induced electromagnetic ﬁelds
under such separation depend essentially on the mass - charge ratio of carriers,
while the mass of a carrier is not relevant in Maxwell’s equations. The joint
carrier for formally separated gravity and electromagnetism suggests that it is
necessary to search for new variables for the classical Lagrangian of charged
matter. The immediate task may be to derive at least one dynamic equation
including the ratio of electric and gravitomechanical charges of material carriers.

By its natural involvement into various physical problems, the canonical
four-momentum ought to be used as a dynamical variable for the action of a
collisionless object N. But the classical theory of ﬁelds and particles, for example
[4-8], does not employ the canonical four-momentum as a dynamical variable.
The known approaches, for example [7], to combine mechanical and electric
charges under a joint geodesic motion were associated with the complicated
modiﬁcations of space geometry and with the discussions about the structure
of charges in general relativity. For well known reasons the classical theories of
ﬁelds and particles, including the non-dualistic approaches [9-12], look incom-
plete and do not overcome some internal diﬃculties.

We examine once again a non-dualistic way by trying to evacuate point
sources from ﬁeld equations in agreement with Einstein’s intention. The par-
ticle integration into the very structure of the ﬁeld was assumed in his last
constructions, for example, ”We could regard matter as being made up of re-
gions of space in which the ﬁeld is extremely intense... There would be no room
in this new physics for both ﬁeld and matter, for the ﬁeld would be the only
reality” (translation [11]). This program is not accomplished yet in a classical
approach and it may be considered as a motivation for our eﬀorts.

In order to reveal the new opportunities of the classical theory we replace
the point charge by the elementary charged continuum emanating from a point
source in parallel with the Coulomb and the Newton ﬁelds. This elementary ﬁeld
continuum with the homogeneous charge densities at the ”light cone” points
may be called (conventionally) a cone-particle. At ﬁrst glance this alterna-
tive approach would seem unreasonable in any practical treatment because ev-
ery inﬁnite charged continuum of matter would have inﬁnite energy. But it
will be shown below that the emanating cone-particle and the paired emanat-
ing cone-ﬁeld form together a uniﬁed material complex (called an elementary
particle-ﬁeld object) with only zero components of the energy-tensor density.
Einstein’s concept of cone-charges integrated into ”the very ﬁeld structure” be-
comes free from inﬁnite self-energies and can propose a clear mechanism for
particle’s action-at-a-distance [12].

Again, we start from the assumption that every elementary charge or par-
ticle may be considered in terms of an inﬁnite material continuum (emanating
with a zero four-interval from a moving point source). Each of the two mir-
ror cones with joint vertex in four-space contains its own particle matter to
counterbalance its own elementary ﬁeld. This assists us in removing from the

2

theory the unreasonable advanced ﬁeld solutions of classical electrodynamics,
where only one point particle-source (rather than two mirror particle-sources)
in a joint vertex was wrongly associated with both Minkowski’s cones.

The retarded relations appear in the theory with locally bound particle-ﬁeld
matter (at all cone points x) only with respect to its source at cone’s vertex
ξ.
It will be veriﬁed (after deriving the dynamical equations) that the four-
dimensional material ﬂows of any cone-particle and its cone-ﬁeld are mutually
compensated at every local point of the elementary object, which holds insep-
arably the particle and ﬁeld fractions of matter at its family of ”light cone”
points. Actually, after Mach’s general ideas [13], there is nothing new in com-
pensating the motion of particles and ﬁelds. The emitting material cone object
(excluding its vertex) may be treated as one multifractional ﬁeld in the non-
dualistic terminology, but we shall refer traditionally to the elementary particle
and to the elementary ﬁeld fractions in order to trace their contributions into
the pure ﬁeld equations (derived below). But now particles (fractions) are not
elementary objects as they cannot move independently without the Machian
counterbalance within every elementary object, i.e. within the multifractional
ﬁeld cone.

N , aN µ, and gN

We shall introduce a uniﬁed particle-ﬁeld action for one elementary cone ob-
ject N, for which we choose four proper variables, PN µ, xµ
µν . The
four Euler-Lagrange equations will involve only ﬁnite physical magnitudes, and
these equations will correspond to the known demands for collisionless motion
of charges. Electrodynamics and general relativity appear as a uniﬁed theory,
where Maxwell’s equations and the Einstein equation follow directly from vari-
ation of the same action. The inseparably bound particle and ﬁeld fractions
of matter will assist us in overcoming the classical problem of electric charge
self-acceleration after replacing the incomplete Minkowski equation by its non-
stationary generalization for the complete cone object.
It will be derived that the energy-tensor density T µν

N at every material point
x of the elementary particle-ﬁeld object N takes only zero components, i.e.
the elementary ﬁeld energetically compensates (or screens) the particle frac-
tion within their joint geometrical hypersurface. The Einstein equation may
T µν
N = 0, for an ensemble of
be represented via the linear algebraic sum,
elementary particle-ﬁeld objects.

N

After deriving the classical equations not through the collective ﬁelds but
in the Machian terms of the proper and external ﬁelds for every selected cone
object (”body versus the rest of the Universe”) we shall verify the symmetrical
involvement of external electric charges and masses (associated with a joint
forming-up ﬁeld aK µ) into the proper canonical four-momentum PN µ. This will
reveal new (electromagnetic) references for the metric tensor gN
µν of the proper
pseudo-Riemannian four-space. General relativity will become a self-contained
theory, which will exhibit Machian mechanics in its nonrelativistic limit, rather
than the Newtonian approximation.

P

We shall employ the accepted tetrad formalism to demonstrate the hidden

symmetry for matter - the ﬂat three-space geometry for every selected object N,
ij = δij, despite that every component of the proper pseudo-Riemannian
i.e. γ N
metric tensor, gN
= ηµν , depends on gravity in full agreement with the Einstein
It will be particularly remarkable to derive that the application of
theory.
Euclidean three-space for gravitation is consistent with the main tests (light
deﬂection, redshift, perihelion precession) of general relativity. The ﬂat three-
space admits the gauge-invariant constructions by tracing in (1) the proper

duced cone-charges for the solid states. One could select the other experimental
indications against the point treatment of elementary charges, including the
celebrated Aharonov - Bohm phenomenon [15].

New opportunities of general relativity with the ﬂat 3D subspace allow the
theory to incorporate electrical charges into the standard covariant scheme with
the proper pseudo-Riemannian four-spaces. External charges and masses cannot
change Euclidean geometry of the common (for all objects) three-space, but they
aﬀect the proper time of every charged object. The predicted electromagnetic
time dilation and compression are available for simple laboratory tests.

2. Action of the cone particle-ﬁeld object

It is common knowledge that the covariant electrodynamic equations with a
current density and with the Lorentz force may be obtained from the variational
principle in four-space. Both relativistic methods, developed by M. Born [16] or
H. Weyl [17], declare that it is possible to ﬁx electromagnetic ﬁelds under path
variations for charges as well as to ﬁx four-coordinates of free charges under
ﬁeld variations. But such assumptions cannot be valid in general. Sometimes a
coordinate displacement of charges is the only reason for creation of macroscopic
electromagnetic ﬁelds within an electroneutral system (a rotating conductor, for
example).

The particular purpose of this section is to introduce the universal dynamical
variables in order to remove the preliminary assumptions one uses when varying
the action of charged matter. Only for this goal we consider for a moment the
pure particle action-at-a-distance

an introduction of the common space-time,

objects after an appropriate selection of the common time parameter t (deﬁned

all objects). Below there will appear two opposite parametric time intervals,

Unlike the formal interaction-at-a-distance between point sources, a real

of the emitted cones at joint material points x = xN = xK . The basic operator

One ought to exclude the source point ξ (and ξ) from an elementary cone-
particle in order to avoid a twofold account of the conjugated notions (the
charged source and the charged cone-particle) under description of one elemen-
tary object. To operate with two diﬀerent kinds of coordinates for point sources
of matter and for matter itself (i.e.
inﬁnite particle-ﬁeld cones excluding the
vertexes), we have to distinguish the conjugated characteristics. For example, a
function ˆPN µ(ξ[p]) represents a canonical four-momentum of a point source N.
A function-density PN µ(x)s=o

The particle-source action (2) is independent from the emitted ﬁeld fraction
of matter and can be associated only with the pure particle fraction of the cone
object. By following Mach’s ideas any particle matter has to be completed by an
inﬁnite material system to create a self-contained physical object. In agreement
with his consideration, every particle is only a fraction of an inﬁnite particle-ﬁeld
system. For collisionless matter one may try Mach’s approach at the level of
one elementary self-contained system - an elementary particle-ﬁeld cone object.

The arbitrary variations are not necessarily compatible [18] with any re-
stricting conditions for the path parameter p, for example s[p]
= 0 for virtual
variations in (3b). But after variation of the action, one may specify the appro-
priate path parameter in the derived equations of motion due to some additional
restrictions for real matter (or for real antimatter). In equation (5) we operate
with the family of material points x which correspond to the real cone object N.
A selection of any one point x for consideration provides an appropriate selection
of the path parameter p = τ1,2 due to the material restriction s[τ1,2] = 0 with
two possible solutions τ1 and τ2 for the mirror cones in our metric four-space.
Even though the covariant equations are four-dimensional in the proper four-
space, dynamics of matter depends on the development parameter, and there
must be a three-dimensional picture as seen by an observer. This motivates
us to introduce a new parametric interval (a time diﬀerential dt) in order to
describe the evolution of matter (or antimatter) in three-space x. One can
therefore perform the line integration over p in the deﬁnition (4) to introduce
the material four-ﬂow densities of two mirror cone-particles via appropriate time
diﬀerentials dt1 and dt2 ,

Every considered point x with coordinates xi in three-space can be related
to two reference points ξ[τ1,2 ] , ξ[τ1 ]
= ξ[τ2 ] , by the two zero-interval conditions,
s(x, ξ[τ1 ]) = 0 and s(x, ξ[τ2 ]) = 0. Both these conditions provide dxo = dζo[τ1,2],
where dζo[τ1,2] = dτ1,2∂ζo[τ1,2]/∂τ1,2 for the mirror cones with matter or anti-
matter. By making use of this fact we introduced in (6) the opposite parametric

material objects that both these diﬀerentials (common time rate) are indepen-
dent from proper parameters of diﬀerent objects.

The direct, with τ1 , (the inverted, with τ2 ) four-ﬂow density (6) of a cone-
particle and the direct (the inverted) time interval (7) are associated with the
direct (the inverted) elementary cone-ﬁeld in (5) (Appendix 1). By applying
three-space and the time parameter from (7), one ﬁnds a coincidence of a dy-
namical three-dimensional picture for direct particle-ﬁeld objects (matter) and
for inverted ones (antimatter) under appropriate applications of the direct and
the inverted time intervals, dt1 =

The mirror elementary cone-particles N1 and N2 occupy the direct and the
inverted cones with matter and antimatter, respectively, within one metric four-
space. But a particle (or antiparticle) fraction from one cone is not bound with
an antiﬁeld (or ﬁeld) fraction from the mirror cone. By trying to relate one
point charged particle in the joint vertex of two pure ﬁeld cones to both these
ﬁelds, the Minkowski theory resulted in the unreasonable advanced solutions for
emitted ﬁeld matter.

There are neither retarded nor advanced relations of the cone-particle with
the paired cone-ﬁeld in the concept of inﬁnite cone charges. The cone-ﬁeld
and cone-particle elementary densities are locally bound (without any delay) at
every material point in four-space. By choosing appropriately the space-time
metric systems for matter or for antimatter, one obtains only retarded emission
from point sources. We omit below the ”1” or ”2” subscript in dτ or dt by
dealing, for simplicity, only with matter and the direct space-time manifold
dt, xi

, dt = +

Again, the choice of the time parameter t for matter or antimatter is ir-
relevant. The important point is that the cone-particle four-ﬂow density may
be divided in (5) into the direct and the inverted components, as well as the
elementary cone-ﬁeld at the left hand side of the equation (5). Note, that the

Every considered point x with four-coordinates xν can be related to sources

material cone objects can cross one common point x
or gravity of distant stars cross the Earth at any ﬁxed time. Superposition
of diﬀerent elementary cone objects in one common three-dimensional space
x may be described under the common time rate dt (the diﬀerentials (7) are
independent from values τN of the individual path parameters). We shall prove

Note that (11) coincides formally with the Maxwell-Lorentz equation with
the electric current density. But equations (9)-(11) were obtained for inﬁnite
cone-particles and cone-ﬁelds in space-time, rather than for point particle-
sources and cone-ﬁelds. The physical densities no(x), µo(x), and ρo(x), for
example, are associated with material cone objects rather than with point ob-

density jν
of the space-time manifold.

In turn, the electric current density jν

q (x), which is speciﬁed for cone-charges
excluding the hole peculiarities, might be formally conjugated to a sum of mov-
ing point charge-sources, ˆqN , distributed over these peculiarities. But contrary
to the density of the material continuum, the density of the point sources at
one ﬁxed point x is meaningless. One should not neglect this obvious fact by
trying to formulate a self-consistent theory in the classical way of point carriers
of electric charge or mass. One may operate at least with a ﬁnite number of
peculiarities within a ﬁnite volume rather than within a single point.

Requirements of ﬁnite physical magnitudes at all space points for all ma-
terial objects additionally motivate us to put into consideration an elementary
electric charge (and mass) in terms of an elementary continuum (cone) with
one reference point (source in cone’s vertex) and with a homogeneous charge
density qN (and mN ) at all points of this elementary continuum. It seems very
unlikely that it is possible to overcome the problem of divergences in classical
electrodynamics without changing the accepted paradigm of point charges (but

12

not point sources for the inﬁnite charges). ”A coherent ﬁeld theory,” stated
Einstein (translation [11]), ”requires that all its elements be continuous ... And
from this requirement arises the fact that the material particle has no place as a
basic concept in a ﬁeld theory. Thus, even apart from the fact that it does not
include gravitation, Maxwell’s theory cannot be considered a complete theory.”
The above introduced separation of the material particle with a source of matter
and the transformation of the point particle into the charged cone continuum is
simply a probe way to complete the theory.

Contrary to classical theory, which admits bulk (free of particles) three-
space regions, the equation (9), for example, can not be applied with zero
density of particle matter at any point x. Charged cone matter of the same
elementary particle-ﬁeld object is emitted from diﬀerent positions of its source
and this elementary matter crosses all diﬀerent three-space points x at the
same time parameter. The elementary cone-particle (and cone-charge) density
takes place simultaneously at all three-space points (the same is true for the
elementary cone-ﬁeld density). For these reasons, a total superposition of cone-
particles (and cone-charges) always has to be present at any three-space point,
i.e. no(x)
= 0 for all x (while ρo(x) could be equal to zero at some
three-space points only due to the opposite signs of the electric charge densities
in the material superposition). Three-space is actually a material space-charge
manifold without bulk regions, and source peculiarities are not included in this
material continuum.

4.2. Stationary states

physics, for example, we consider only one kind of dynamical partial solutions of
(15) and (16), when WN µν (x)s=0
x6=ξ = 0 at all material points x of the elementary
cone N. Such solutions satisfy stationary states of elementary cone objects (as it
will be seen from the relativistic generalization of the Newton law (34), derived
below) and they are associated with potential motion of cone-charges. The
canonical four-momentum density PN µ(x)s=0
x6=ξ can be written in this special case
via a scalar potential ΥN (x)s=0

a superconductor.

The potential states, which are associated with equations (24) - (28), may
be applied to many stationary problems, such as the ﬁeld description of the
Cooper pairs within a superconductor, the dissipationless motion of free elec-
trons within a conductor, the bound electron states in atoms, etc. All these
elementary carriers are not involved in collisions and can be characterized by
the individual potentials ΥK (x)s=0
x6=ξ (corresponding to the phases of wavefunc-
tions for elementary matter in quantum theory).

Now we shall consider a uniformly rotating conductor (the Faraday disk) in
order to analyze the relativistic experiment of Ref. 14 in terms of the approach,
developed herein. Rotation leads to the metric-velocity ﬁelds (18) and (19) in
every frame of reference. The induced stationary electric and magnetic ﬁelds
within the conductor create compensating Lorentz forces that allow free cone-
charges to rotate synchronously with the ion lattice without collisions. One may
say that stationary cone-charges (electrons) take potential states and satisfy (24)
- (28).

We ﬁnd the electric and magnetic ﬁelds within a uniformly rotating conduc-
tor with an angular frequency ω in an inertial frame (chosen for simplicity, as
r) by averaging (27) and (28),

As to superelectrons, they are exclusively responsible for the collective quan-
tization of the London magnetic moment due to the nonvanishing macroscopic
potential < χs
= 0, contrary to the unquantized Barnet mag-
netic moment of rotating normal metals. Each normal electron possesses a
stationary superﬂuid state with an individual potential χn
K (x). However, any
ensemble of normal electrons cannot exhibit macroscopic superﬂuid properties
in space-time because < χn
K (x) >K = 0 after averaging over the Fermi volume,
rather than over the equipotential Fermi surface in the case of paired supercon-
ducting electrons.

Thus, the developed treatment of collisionless electrons in terms of the super-
ﬂuid cone-charges in (15) or (27)-(28) can explain the relativistic mass-charge
ratio of carriers for the London moment that is hitherto unexplained by the
currently available theories.

5. Bound motion of the cone-charge and its cone-ﬁeld

The new interpretation of particles in terms of charged cones emanating from
point sources should not be inconsistent with the laws of motion for these sources
which were tested in diﬀerent experiments. For comparison with classical theory
we could study the dynamics of an elementary source by neglecting for a moment
the inseparable particle-ﬁeld relation within the uniﬁed elementary object. The
path variations δξλ[p] in the particle-source action (2) are related to deviations
of the path parameter δp with δξλ[

But the Minkowski equation (32) or (32b) seems incomplete in our approach,

This equation is a generalization of the second Newton law for the elemen-
tary cone objects. It replaces the incomplete equation (32a) conjugated to the
Minkowski equation of motion, (32) or (32b), for the charged point source. The
nonstationary equation (34) might be simpliﬁed into the stationary equation
(32a) only for the potential motion of cone charges, when dPN ν (x)/dt = 0 and
WN νλ(x) = 0.

One can derive from (33) and (34) a conjugated equation for nonstationary

to be sure that changes of the canonical energy-momentum ˆPN ν (ξ[θ]) along the

the cone object is free from self-acceleration, contrary to the Minkowski equa-
tion (32b), which is valid (and may be used) only for stationary motion of
charged sources under the mutual compensation of the gravitomechanical and
the electrodynamic four-forces.

Notice from (34) that

x6=ξ[τ ] = 0 for any stationary state of ele-

6. Zero energy-tensor density vs the Einstein equation

There is no well deﬁned procedure in classical theory to separate energy-
tensor densities of a particle system from the collective electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Moreover, collisions of elementary objects may be accompanied by a heat energy
release. Only a collisionless system of elementary objects can be considered in
terms of the Lagrangian density without introduction of temperature and other

19

thermodynamic characteristics. But according to (5) there is no way at all to
separate the paired four-ﬂow densities of elementary ﬁeld and particle matter
within the same elementary cone, and we shall use below this fundamental
statement eﬃciently.

In agreement with (33), the Hilbert variation procedure [19] for (3b) with
respect to the proper variational form of the metric tensor (¯δgµν(x) = δgµν(x)
under δxλ = 0) provides the used above symmetric energy-tensor density,
TN µ(x)s=o
x6=ξ, of the elementary particle-ﬁeld object N. One may ﬁx under this
variation the contravariant coordinate vectors dxµ (but not the covariant ones,
δdxν = δ(gµνdxµ) = dxµδgµν), the universal scalars mN (x) and qN (x), the co-

Note that symmetric components of gµν are not independent one from an-
other, δgµν = δgνµ. Furthermore, iµδPµ=mN iµδ[gµνdxν (gρλdxρdxλ)−1/2] =
[(δgµν )mN iµdxν /2ds] + [(δgνµ)mN iνdxµ/2ds] = mN (iµdxν + iνdxµ)δgµν /2ds,

It is obvious from (5) that the energy-tensor density (35) has zero compo-
nents under potential states, when WN µν(x)s[τ ]=0
x6=ξ[τ ] = 0, and that this tensor is
traceless under any general motion of matter, gµν(x)T µν
0. Further-
more, there are no special reasons in our approach to involve artiﬁcially a scalar
metric curvature R into the complete action (3b) for the collisionless particle-
ﬁeld object. The curvature ought to appear naturally in any self-contained
theory. Moreover, the Rainich - Misner criterion, RRM =0, for uniﬁed theories
[20,21] dismisses scalar curvatures in the initial dynamical equations. In other
words, variation of the action (3b) with respect to ¯δgµν leads to recognizing that
the energy-tensor density (35) takes only zero components in the most general
case,

N (x)s=0

x6=ξ ≡

N (x)s[τ ]=0

i.e. the paired cone-ﬁeld and cone-particle fractions energetically compensate
(or screen) each other for collisionless motion of the elementary object.

By applying (5) for (35), one reads a fourth Euler-Lagrange equation of

motion (36) for the elementary particle-ﬁeld object in the following form,

Until this moment there are no real innovations in the theory. The known
classical equation are simply rewritten in the Machian form (due to (5), (15),
(34), (36)), in order to study Einstein’s intention to integrate the particle into
the inﬁnite ﬁeld structure. But this new representation separates the proper and
external classical ﬁelds that may open the gates for modernization of gravity
within Einstein’s covariant mechanism as well as for uniﬁcation of gravitation
and electromagnetism. Below we study the symmetrical involvements of exter-
nal masses and charges into the proper metric tensor and develop Einstein’s
type of relativity with the ﬂat three-interval in the proper pseudo-Riemannian
four-interval.

7. Einstein’s relativity under Euclidean three-space

7.1. Newtonian and Machian options in gravitomechanics

The above developed covariant constructions depend essentially on space-
time geometry for matter. This geometry cannot be derived from a theory
and may be accepted only on the basis of experiments with material objects.
General relativity, while refereed by Newtonian gravitation in the nonrelativis-
tic limit, operates with curved three-spaces in agreement, for example, with
Schwarzschild’s solution [22] for point masses. But Einstein’s universal theory
can ﬂuently operate, as known, with diﬀerent solutions for space metric under
the pseudo-Riemannian four-interval.

There are no point masses in our constructions and Schwarzschild’s solu-
tions cannot be appropriate for inﬁnite cone-particles. Nevertheless, would the
statements of Newtonian gravitation be adopted by our approach in the nonrela-
tivistic limit, the above derived equations could reproduce the known relativistic
formalism in the new form, but without any reasonable contributions neither
into electrodynamics nor into gravitation.

22

Below we departure from Newtonian gravitation as a postulated reference
limit for general relativity. The universal application of (5) to both masses
and charges provides the new model references (electrodynamic ones) for me-
chanical systems. The theory becomes self-contained and the derived (but not
postulated) nonrelativistic limit corresponds to Mach’s ”Science of Mechanics”,
rather than to Newton’s ”Principia”.

Before the declared program will be accomplished, we independently examine
(goal of this section) what’s wrong with Newton’s gravitomechanics. One should
not silently bypass the Standard Model for nonrelativistic mechanical systems,
despite the fact that there is a formal (electrodynamic) way to do it correctly
from the mathematical point of view.

The Machian formalism for mechanical motion of the simplest two-body sys-
tem is summarized in the Appendix 2. Both Newtonian and Machian approaches
lead to the measured acceleration of free fall, g = GM/r2, for example. But
energy exchange between falling bodies is absent in Newton’s gravitomechan-
ics (only three-momentum exchange takes place), while Machian nonstationary
motion admits energy redistribution between bodies.

Einstein’s covariant formalism in (42) exhibits that there is no stationary
conservation, dpo/ds
= 0, for energy under a free fall in gravitational ﬁelds in
spite of the observable condition ∂po(r, t)/∂r = 0. Space and time are bound
notions for both relativistic and nonrelativistic material objects, and nonstation-
ary equations for matter are reasonable only in partial derivatives. In Machian
= const for free fall, for example, and this nonrelativistic motion
mechanics po 6
is in full agreement with Einstein’s relativity. Below we return to this point.

Now we examine the diﬀerence in geometrical consequences associated with
Newton’s and Machian’s options of motion. We start from the Fermat vari-
ational principle [8] of general relativity in order to study light rays in com-

In general, the total Universe is the only closed system because all material
objects are involved in gravitational interactions. The conservation law (46)
corresponds to Mach’s mechanics (with the mutual motion of the selected mass
and ”the rest of the Universe” [13]), where the proper and external material
ﬁelds are separated. There are no ﬁxed or static external gravitation ﬁelds for
photons or freely moving particles in principle, and one cannot use the options
ko(θ) = const or po(θ) = const without determining an appropriate level of
approximations for any particular problem.

According to the universal conservation (46) one can ﬁnd nonstationary

Contrary to Schwarzschild’s approach [22], we found the nonrelativistic four-
interval (57) without referring to Newton’s (or Mach’s) gravitation, that was
expected for the self-contained constructions. Our gravitational time dilation

By taking into account these conservation laws in (57) one obtains an equation

by keeping only the oldest nonlinear terms. This equation may be solved in
two steps, when a linear solution, uo = µL−2(1 + ǫcosϕ), is substituted into the
nonlinear terms on the right hand side of (59).

The most important correction (which is summed over century rotations
of the planets) is related to the ”resonance” (proportional to ǫcosϕ) nonlinear
terms. We therefore ignore in (59) all corrections, apart from u2
2µ2L−4ǫcosϕ

It is important to emphasize that the measured result, ∆ϕ, for the planet
perihelion precession in weak Sun’s ﬁeld was derived from the nonlinear four-
interval (56) under the ﬂat three-space, rather than from the linear four-interval
under the curved three-space [8,23,24]. The mass dependent coeﬃcient at the
three-interval dl in (58) does not mean violation of Euclidean three-space ge-
ometry in gravitational ﬁelds.

Thus, the Euclidean three-space geometry provides the alternative way to
explain the main gravitational tests (planet perihelion precession, gravitational

31

light bending, redshift and time dilation), to construct self-contained relativity,
to adopt Machian mechanics and to overcome the known conceptual diﬃculties,
associated with Schwarzschild’s solutions for point material objects. Covari-
ant form of general relativity can hold universal ﬂat three-space, which remains
common for all material objects, contrary to their proper four-dimensional man-
ifolds.

Could this approach predict something new or it is simply a self-consistent
reconsideration of only known phenomena? One may note that ﬂat three-space
is able to remove the conventional objections (space curvature) for accepting
the hypothesis [29] of electromagnetic origin of gravity in order to expect some
contributions into the current developments through the zero-point ﬁeld [30-32
]. The zero energy tensor density (36) of the introduced inﬁnite cone-objects
can be employed for superﬂuid vacuum states and for studying ways of vacuum
energy extraction [33]. Machian motion of charged matter in external ﬁelds (34)-
(34a) may be useful for the search [34] of new mechanisms of space propulsion of
sources, for example, due to separation of charges within electoneutral systems.
By way of illustration of some applications in more detail, we predict from
our approach a new phenomenon (proper time dilation and compression), which
cannot be proposed by the conventional and alternative developments of rela-
tivity, for example [35-38]. The selected innovation is available for prompt
laboratory tests and may be interesting for practical applications.

The observable motion of matter is three-dimensional in spite of that various
high dimensional manifolds can be employed for self-consistent dynamical states
of material objects. Geometries of the proper high dimensional manifolds diﬀer
from the universal (for all objects) geometry of the common 3D subspace. The
proper metric tensor gµν ≡
ν of pseudo-Riemannian 4D-space may take
only nonzero components, but always must hold (in the developed construc-
tions) Euclidean geometry for 3D subspace, due to the hidden degeneration,
goigojg−1

portunity for implementation of electric charges into the conventional covariant

By considering joint roots for the electric and gravitomechanical external
ﬁelds, one can introduce (for a selected charged object N) a proper canoni-
cal four-dimensional space xµ

electric and gravitomechanical external charges. The proper canonical four-

One can verify from (60) that the canonical metric tensor is consistent with
the same ﬂat three-space, goigojg−1
gij = δij , as the pure mechanical ana-
log (55). The sole diﬀerence between the proper four-intervals in the canonical
and mechanical pseudo-Riemannian four-spaces is related to the diﬀerent proper
times for charged and for uncharged objects in external ﬁelds. But the proper
times are always diﬀerent even among pure mechanical objects and the ad-
ditional contribution of electrical charges into the proper time notion cannot
change Einstein’s covariant mechanism for relativistic motion.

In the general case the proper time of the selected charged object N, dτN ≡

Again, any curved proper four-space (which is personal for every neutral
or charged object) is only auxiliary notion. Evolution of matter takes place in
three-space with the universal Euclidean geometry for all charged and uncharged
objects. There are no common curved Universe or curved four-space for all
objects as their proper four-intervals depend on diﬀerent proper times (61).
Nevertheless one may consider a common space-time manifold
, because
the universal time rate (7) is independent from personal parameters for both
charged and uncharged objects.

pure mechanical space-time relations, VµV µ =1, for electrically charged objects.
This fact prevented to a reasonable introduction of the carrier canonical four-
momentum as an independent variable in the classical theory, which operates
with the collective classical ﬁeld, rather than with the proper and external
notions for every object under its moving versus ”the rest of the Universe”.

9. Conclusion

Our approach to the elementary objects was initiated by the introduction
of the elementary cone-particle and the elementary cone-ﬁeld in terms of a
uniﬁed material continuum emanating from a point source. Every object with
a rest-mass contains these two inseparable fractions of matter. The fractions
are speciﬁed at the same points of the proper four-space xµ = xµ
N , which are
related to the zero four-intervals with respect to each other and the vertex
ξ. The particle and ﬁeld cone fractions can be represented by WN µν(x) =

Initially general relativity bypassed, as known, the Mach principle. Nev-
ertheless this covariant theory in its nonrelativistic limit corresponds to the
Machian ideas for gravitomechanics and disagrees with some conventional state-
ments of Newtonian gravitation. Being uniﬁed with electrodynamics, general
relativity becomes a self-contained theory, which may be compared with prac-
tice, without references from the other theories. The available practice does not
disagree with Euclidean geometry of three-space for all known kinds of interac-
tions.

The developed linear synthesis of external electromagnetic and gravitational
ﬁelds (under the nonlinear proper four-interval), and the integration of the cone-
particle into the accompanying cone-ﬁeld structure satisfy the predicted dou-
ble uniﬁed criterion [11], as well as the other known criteria [20,21] for the
uniﬁed ﬁeld theory. The point sources (i.e. peculiarities of matter) are ex-
cluded from the ﬁeld equations in agreement with Einstein’s approach [42] to
the continuum theory. General relativity in the present form is consistent with
Sakharov’s hypothesis about the electromagnetic origin of gravitation [29], while
Schwarzschild’s three-space curvature in the accepted approach to gravitation
cannot be derived from the electromagnetic vacuum radiation or the zero-point
ﬁeld [30-33].

As to experiments, the gravitational redshift, light bending and planet peri-
helion precession correspond to the introduced cone model for matter under ﬂat
3D subspace. The continual treatment of the elementary electric charge is con-
sistent with the celebrated Aharonov-Bohm phenomenon [15] and provides the
way to understand the relativistic experiments with rotating superconductors
[14]. A simple opportunity to verify the proposed approach to electrogravity
under the electromechanical proper 4D spaces is to test in a laboratory the
predicted electromagnetic time compression or dilation for charged objects in
external electric ﬁelds.

The cone concept of the inﬁnite elementary particle with the cone charges
rejects the classical three-space with bulk (particle matter free) regions. Any
ensemble of cone particle-ﬁeld objects holds zero energy tensor components, but
can provide sophisticated ways for information and energy transfer within the
charged three-space continuum of matter. New mechanisms of energy redis-
tribution and extraction from this material continuum may be considered as
applied goals for studies.

ﬁelds under the developed concept of proper and external notions, including the
proper metric tensor gN
µν . One might assume, for a moment, that
the same energy of gravitational interaction,
Gm1m2/R12, is accounted twice
in the two-body problem, based on the conservation of the sum (46) with proper
relativistic four-momentum. This is not the case in the employed Machian con-
cept of the mutual (body versus the rest of the Universe) motion under the
proper and external gravitational ﬁelds. Below we prove that our approach
leads to the measured (Newtonian) free fall acceleration, despite admits energy
exchange between falling bodies.

in particularly, Newton’s accelerations, g1(2) ≡
∂tv1(2) =
1(2), for a joint radial fall. For general
kinds of motion the equations (B1) - (B3) disagree with the Newton dynamical
laws, which neglect the diﬀerence between total and partial time derivatives.
Nonrelativistic dynamics (B1) - (B3) corresponds, for example, to the enhanced
Lunar and Solar tides in comparison with the Newtonian results.

By making use of (B3) and (B2) one can calculate the energy exchange rate,

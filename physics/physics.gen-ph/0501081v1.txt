Abstract

We present a theory based upon the treatment of the gravitational ﬁeld
as a sea of gravity quanta, as deﬁned elsewhere. The resultant model for
the Universe is a static one, like Einstein ﬁrst saw, with a new feature:
a local shrinking quantum world that completely explains the Hubble red
shift under a new point of view. The presently accepted expansion of the
Universe is interpreted here as an apparent eﬀect, as seen from the Lab sys-
tem of reference. The static Universe has immersed in it a local shrinking
atomic world: a fundamental change in the interpretation of the Hubble’s
observations. The conservation principles (momentum, angular momentum
and energy) can be dealt with under 2 diﬀerent points of view:
local (ap-
parent) and COSMOLOGICAL (”real”). The 2 are in complete agreement
with observation. They are also free of well known contradictions or para-
doxes/incoherencies (i.e. in the Big Bang model). By dealing now with very
well known ﬁrst principles (Heisenberg, Mach, de Broglie, Weinberg’s rela-
tion) under the same 2 points of view, we arrive at the conclusion that our
new approach is in accordance with the Einstein’s ﬁeld equations of General
Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics. We consider this to be a promising
ﬁrst step towards the way of dealing with the gravitational ﬁeld coherently
both from the General Relativity and from the Quantum Mechanical theo-
ries. The agreement with the present values of the cosmological parameters
is very satisfactory.

1 Introduction

The point of view of considering the gravitational ﬁeld as a sea of gravity quanta
[1] has been dealt with elsewhere. The published result there for the mass mg
of this quantum is given by the relation mg = ~/(c2t), where t is the age of the
Universe (then today mg is of the order of 2 × 10−66 grams).

The ﬁrst important consequence of the above approach is the need to intro-
duce a new concept, that we call the Mass Boom, [2], [3], [4] and [5]. In essence it
expresses the property of any gravitational mass that, due to the emission of these
gravity quanta, having a negative energy, its mass increases linearly with cosmo-
logical time. This linear dependence between mass and time makes it possible to

identify the mass of the Universe M with the cosmological time t. A philosophical
statement like we are made of time obviously follows and merits a deep reﬂexion.
Clearly this approach is of the Machean type.

The second important consequence of this approach is that the speed of light
must decrease with time. In fact it can be equated to the inverse of t, c = 1/t
[4] and [5] Then the resultant model for the Universe is a static one, as Einstein
ﬁrst proposed, and mathematically stated as a(t) = ct = constant, i.e. a constant
cosmological scale factor. The expansion of the Universe, a generally accepted
interpretation of the red shift, is interpreted here as an apparent eﬀect seen from
the laboratory system of reference. The reinterpretation of the Hubble red shift
is that the quantum world is shrinking, an eﬀect coming directly from the time
variation of Planck’s constant [3], proportional to 1/t2 or equivalently to c2.

The work we present here is based upon the above results. We analyze, from
this new point of view, the conservation principles, and solve both: the Schr¨odinger
equation together with the Einstein cosmological equations, which represents a
ﬁrst step in the harmonization of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity. The con-
clusion is that the whole approach is very promising and liberates present theories
(like the Big Bang) from contradictions ands paradoxes. The agreement with the
known numerical values for the cosmological parameters, as accepted today, is very
satisfactory.

2 New concepts in the conservation principles

A summary of the new concepts is as follows:

• The mass of the gravity quanta, mg = ~/(c2t).
• The Mass Boom eﬀect: any gravitational mass m has a time dependence as

m = constant t (t the age of the Universe).

• The decrease of the speed of light with time, c = 1/t.
• The G = c3 relation, following the Action Principle.

• Heisenberg and the De Broglie wavelength (perhaps the Compton wavelength

as an alternative), ~/mc = constant in the Lab.

• The v/c constancy as seen from the LAB system in order to conserve the

constancy of the relativistic relations at any time.

• The Mass Boom is always present (as long as gravity is present).

• The decrease of the speed of light with time as c = 1/t, always present as
a consequence of the constancy of momentum (in the absence of mechanical
perturbations).

• The apparent interpretation of the cosmological expansion, following the

Hubble’s observations.

• The h = c2 relation (which explains the contraction of the quantum world).

• Weinberg’s relation under a new point of view: not only explains the quan-
tum of mass at the local Lab. It explains the Universe as a quantum black
hole whose mass increases linearly with time.

• The introduction of H = 1, the cosmological Planck’s constant, given by
the relation H = ~t2 = 1, which is the essence of the quantum approach to
cosmology.

• The Cosmological Planck’s units using H, instead of ~, deﬁning the cosmo-
logical quantum given by the whole Universe (mass, size and time M = t,
and size ct = 1 = 1028 cm with the constant homogeneous tic given by
Planck’s time).

• The ﬂuctuation of the whole Universe, seen as a quantum black hole (cor-

roborated by the Weinberg’s relation using H).

• The determination of the age of the Universe as t = 1061 units of time (the
age of the Universe today) and given by the ratio of Planck’s length at t = 1
(the constant length 1028 cm) and the present value of 10−33 cm).

• The solution to the cosmological Schr¨odinger equation coupled with the
Einstein’s cosmological equations (harmonization of General Relativity and
Quantum Mechanics).

• The new entropy concept, that includes the gravitational entropy: S =

kM/mg = M = t (for the Universe, [6]).

3 The solution to the Schr¨odinger cosmological
equation coupled to the Einstein cosmological
equations

The Schr¨odinger equation can be formulated from a cosmological point of view by
using the ”cosmological” Planck’s constant H = ~t2 = 1 (a real constant). The
resultant equation is then:

H 2
2m

∂2Ψ
∂x2 + V Ψ = iH
We see that all the terms in this equation vary as 1/t. Then multiplying by
t we have both members of the equation constant, as in the normal quantum
mechanical treatment. The solution is then, assuming the wave function to be
represented by a product of two functions: one depending on space and the other
depending on time only, in the usual way one has:

∂Ψ
∂t

Ψ(x, t) = const (sinx) t2

On the other hand the Einstein cosmological equations have the solution a(t) =
t2 [5] which coincides with the above time dependence, as seen from the Lab
reference system. Hence we have the same time dependent solution for both:
General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

4 Conclusions

The main implications of this work are: a change in basic paradigms, perhaps the
most important one is the new explanation for gravitation, in quantum mechanical
terms, and coherent with general relativity. Also a new approach to the entropy
concepts, in particular to the Hawking-Bekenstein treatments, where the entropy
of a black hole is here deﬁned as linear with mass [7]. A return to the Einstein
initial cosmological model is the most signiﬁcant change in the formulation of
cosmological models.

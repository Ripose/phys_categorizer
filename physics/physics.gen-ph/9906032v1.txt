ABSTRACT: It is shown that the traditional conservation laws for total charge, energy,
linear and angular momentum, hold jointly in classical electron theory if and only if classical
electron spin is included as dynamical degree of freedom.

I. INTRODUCTION

‘Classical electron theory’ aims at a consistent description of the dynamics of electro-
magnetic ﬁelds and charged particles. While already equipped with some heuristic rules
to the eﬀect that charged particles occur in stable, ‘quantized’ atomic units, classical elec-
tron theory is dynamically a pre-quantum theory, built on Maxwell’s electromagnetism,
Newton’s or Einstein’s classical mechanics, and the Lorentz force law [20]. It originated
around the time of J.J. Thomson’s discovery of the corpuscular nature of cathode rays [37]
with the work of H. A. Lorentz [21], just before the advent of relativity [23,8,28,25], and
is most prominently associated with the names of Lorentz [21,22] and Abraham [1] (see
also [2,24,33]). Since the simplest classical mathematical structure for an atomic charge,
the point charge, produces inﬁnite Lorentz self-forces and electromagnetic self-energies as-
sociated with the singularities of the Li´enard-Wiechert electromagnetic ﬁeld [19,40] of a
moving point charge, Abraham and Lorentz were led to consider models with extended
microscopic charges that experience a volume-averaged Lorentz force. While problems of
how to bring classical electron theory in line with special relativity still persisted [28,24,11],
quantum mechanics was invented, and classical electron theory dropped from the list of
contenders for a fundamental theory of electromagnetic matter and ﬁelds. Nowadays clas-
sical electron theory has degenerated into a subject of mere historical value — so it would
seem, especially in view of the impressive range of electromagnetic phenomena covered
with spectacular precision by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) [13,5]. However, classi-
cal electron theory has continually been revisited by physicists, an incomplete list being
[11,7,30,26,31,32,41,12]. One reason, apparently, is that the perturbative series deﬁning
QED, while renormalizable in each order [9], is most likely to be merely asymptotic in
character rather than convergent [10], such that precision results are achieved only when
computations are terminated after a few iterations, with no rules as to what is meant by
‘few’. As R. Peierls put it, [27]: “because the use, as basic principle, of a semiconvergent
series is unsatisfactory, there is still interest in theories that avoid singularities.”

Recently, considerable advances have been made in controlling the type of dynamical
equations that govern classical electron theory. A mechanical particle coupled to a scalar
wave ﬁeld has been treated in [14,15,18]. The equations of a classical electron coupled
to the Maxwell ﬁelds are considered in [6,16,17,34]. All these papers deal with a semi-
relativistic theory. This means that, while the wave ﬁeld satisﬁes relativistic equations and
the ‘material’ particle momentum is given by Einstein’s rather than Newton’s expression,
with Abraham [2] one assumes that the particle rigidly retains its shape. A fully relativistic
model, ﬁrst devised in a monumental work by Nodvik [26] and most recently completed in
[3], is considerably more involved but has begun to yield to a mathematical onslaught as
well [3]. As a result, classical electron theory is about to become established as the ﬁrst
mathematically well posed, fully relativistic theory of electromagnetism that consistently
describes the dynamics of discrete charges and the continuum electromagnetic ﬁeld.

In view of the continued interest in classical electron theory it seems worthwhile to
draw attention to a small observation regarding conservation laws which, to the author’s
knowledge, has not been made before, and which seems to be suﬃciently interesting in its
own right to warrant publication in this separate note.

To be speciﬁc, [6,16,17,34,14,15,18] and most earlier works on classical electron theory
only take translational degrees of freedom of the particles into account. Already Abraham
[2] and Lorentz [23] insisted on the possibility of additional degrees of freedom of the
extended charged particles associated with particle spin (not to be confused with the
“rotation of the electrons” in Lorentz’ theory of the Zeeman eﬀect [24], which refers to
circular motion of the electron’s center of charge inside a Thomson atom), though it seems
that only Abraham wrote down corresponding dynamical equations. However, neither of
these authors pursued such a spinning particle motion any further. As a consequence, it
seems to have gone completely unnoticed that omitting particle spin generally leads to a
violation of the law of conservation of total classical angular momentum! The discrepancy
term has the form of an internal torque on the particles. This strongly suggests to add
classical spin to the degrees of freedom of the charge distribution.

In this note we will show that, if classical particle spin is included as degree of freedom
in semi-relativistic classical electron theory, with Abraham’s spherical charge distribution,
then all classical conservation laws are satisﬁed. We will also demonstrate that the arbi-
trary setting to zero of the internal angular velocities of the particles is incompatible with
the classical law of angular momentum conservation. Interestingly, though, the classical
expressions for total charge, energy, and linear momentum are conserved during the motion
even if classical particle spin is omitted.

In a fully relativistic formulation [26,3] the kinematical eﬀect of Thomas precession
[35] enforces additional self rotation of the particle. However, it is the law of angular
momentum conservation which compels us to introduce a ‘classical particle spin’ already
at the level of a semi-relativistic formulation of classical electron theory, i.e. independendly
of Thomas precession.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst present the dynamical equations
(section II), next we prove that the traditional conservation laws are satisﬁed (section III),
then we show (section IV) that angular momentum is not conserved if spin is omitted. In
section V, we conclude with a brief historical musing.

II. THE EQUATIONS OF SEMI-RELATIVISTIC ELECTRON THEORY

We denote by E(x, t) ∈ R3 the electric ﬁeld, and by B(x, t) ∈ R3 the magnetic
induction, at the point x ∈ R3 at time t ∈ R. Let I be a ﬁnite subset of the natural
numbers N, of cardinality |I| = N . We consider N particles indexed by I. With Abraham,
0 (R3),
we assign to particle k a rigid shape given by a nonnegative form function fk ∈ C∞
R3 fk(x)d3x = 1. The total charge qk of particle
having SO(3) symmetry and satisfying
k is distributed in space around the point yk(t) ∈ R3 by ρk(x, t) = qkfk(x − yk(t)),
and rigidly rotating with angular velocity wk(t). We also assign to the particle a ‘bare
inertial mass’ mk (‘material mass’ in [24]) and a ‘bare moment of inertia’ Ik. Moreover, ∇
denotes the gradient operator with respect to x, and a dot on top of a quantity will signify
derivative with respect to time, e.g.

˙yk(t) is the linear velocity of particle k.

Both Newtonian [2,24] and Einsteinian [24,6,16,17,34,14,15,18] momenta have been used
in semi-relativistic variants of classical electron theory. We therefore discuss both cases of
(2.11), but only the nonrelativistic Euler form (2.10) for spin.

Naturally, we want to treat these equations as a Cauchy problem, with initial data
posed at time t = t0. For the mechanical variables of the particles, the data are yk(t0),
˙yk(t0), and wk(t0); and for the ﬁelds, B(x, t0) satisfying (2.3), and E(x, t0) satisfying (2.4)
at t = t0. Actually, one should also think of (2.3) and (2.4) rather as initial conditions, to
be imposed only at t = t0, on the initial data B(x, t0) and E(x, t0), for the above set of
equations is slightly redundant. In fact, (2.3) and (2.4) are automatically satisﬁed for all t
if they are satisﬁed at t = t0. For (2.3) this is seen by taking the divergence of (2.1). For
(2.4) this is seen by taking the divergence of (2.2) and the time-derivative of (2.4), then
using the continuity equation for the charge, which is proven below to hold as consequence
of (2.5), (2.6), and (2.7) alone.

Finally, a few remarks are in order regarding the bare inertias, mk and Ik. By following
up on Thomson’s discovery [36] that the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a particle contributes to
its inertia, Abraham [2] in particular, but also Lorentz [24,23], suggested that inertia is
entirely due to electromagnetic eﬀects, and consequently proposed to set mk = 0 = Ik in
(2.11) and (2.10). However, setting mk = 0 and/or Ik = 0 is in serious conﬂict with the
mathematical structure of a Cauchy problem, see [3] for more on this. In another vein, ever
since Dirac’s work [7] there has been quite some interest in letting mk → −∞ associated
with the mass-renormalized point particle limit fk(x − yk) → δ(x − yk), see [4,29,34].
However, stability problems emerge when mk < 0 and/or Ik < 0, cf. [6] for mk < 0 when
only translational motions are considered. All these problems together suggest that one
should choose the bare inertias strictly positive, i.e. mk > 0 and Ik > 0. Formally though,
as can be seen upon inspection of our proofs below, the conservation laws hold for all
regular solutions of (2.1)–(2.11), with any values of mk ∈ R and Ik ∈ R.

III. CONSERVATION LAWS

We assume that the initial conditions correspond to ﬁnite charge, total energy, linear
and angular momentum. Then, because of the ﬁnite propagation speed for the electro-
magnetic ﬁelds and the non-singular shape function, it is reasonable to expect (but not
proven here) that the particle speeds remain bounded and the motions and ﬁelds regular,
so that all surface integrals over the ﬁelds at inﬁnity vanish at all times. We now prove
that, as a consequence of these hypotheses, the traditional expressions of total charge,
total energy, total linear and total angular momentum, are conserved quantities for the
dynamical equations (2.1)-(2.11).

under the dot product with ˙yk in (3.9). Similarly, inserting X = x − yk, Y = wk and
Z = B in the vector identity X ×

IV. NON-CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM WHEN w ≡ 0

It is now easily seen that, upon setting wk ≡ 0 everywhere in the equations of motion,
the traditional expressions for charge, energy and linear momentum are still conserved, but
the one for angular momentum is not. Indeed, if in the equations of motion we set wk ≡ 0
for all k, and then follow through the computations of section III step by step, with wk ≡ 0
in place everywhere, we easily verify that the conclusions of subsections III.a, III.b, and
III.c still hold. However, if we go through the steps of subsection III.d, with wk ≡ 0 in
place everywhere, we obtain

˙J = −

The right side in (4.1) is, in general, an uncompensated sum of torques. Hence, except for
some special highly symmetric situations, there will be a non-vanishing rate of change of
total angular momentum.

V. CLOSING REMARK

Our observation could have been made at the beginning of the 20th century, by Abra-
ham, Lorentz or Poincar´e, but apparently it wasn’t. So it was left to Uhlenbeck and
Goudsmit [39] to re-invent particle spin for the interpretation of spectral data. It is amus-
ing to contemplate that the story of spin [38] could have been a diﬀerent one.

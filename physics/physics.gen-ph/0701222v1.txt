INTRODUCTION

Reﬂection of light from a plane mirror in uniform recti-
linear motion is a century-old problem, intimately related
to the foundations of special relativity.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
The reﬂection formula is usually obtained by referring
to the Lorentz transformation to switch from the mir-
ror’s rest frame to the frame where the mirror moves at
a constant velocity.4,12,13,14,15,16 The reﬂection formula
also follows from the constancy of the speed of light, by
using Huygens’ construction17 or Fermat’s principle of
least time18.

In this paper, I introduce a derivation of the reﬂection
formula by comparing the geometry of the problem in the
frame where the mirror is moving to the one in the frame
where the mirror is stationary. I analyze three distinct
cases of the mirror’s motion, when the mirror is moving:
a) parallel to its surface; b) perpendicular to its surface;
and c) in an arbitrary direction. The derivation requires
nothing but a simple plane geometry and an elementary
understanding of the postulates of special relativity, and
does not use Lorentz transformation or any additional
tools of classical wave optics.

II. REFLECTION FROM A PLANE MIRROR
MOVING UNIFORMLY PARALLEL TO ITS
SURFACE

A plane mirror of length 2ℓ = LR is placed horizontally
in its rest frame (see Fig. 1). A photon is emitted from a
source A located at a vertical distance h from the left edge
L of the mirror. The photon bounces oﬀ the midpoint
O from the mirror, and it is absorbed by the detector
B located at the same vertical distance h from the right
edge R of the mirror. Evidently, the angle of incidence
and the angle of reﬂection of the photon are equal.

We now transfer to the frame in which the mirror, the
source and the detector are all moving at a constant speed
v to the right (see Fig. 2). Since the point of reﬂection in
the mirror’s rest frame divides its length into two equal
halves, it must also divide the mirror in two equal halves
with respect to any other inertial frame.19 By making this
claim, we implicitly invoked the principle of relativity,
according to which one cannot distinguish one inertial
frame from another. Also, at each instant of time, the

moving source and the moving detector are located at a
vertical distance h above the left and the right edges of
the moving mirror, respectively, as they were in the frame
where the mirror was stationary. Here, we again appealed
to the principle of relativity which directly implies the
invariance of the lengths measured perpendicularly to the
direction of relative motion between the frames.20

In Fig. 2 we see that the photon was emitted from
the moving source at the time when the source was lo-
cated at A1. At this instant, the left edge of the mirror
was located at point L1 at a vertical distance h below
A1, and O1 is the location of the midpoint of the mir-
ror. The photon bounces oﬀ the midpoint O2 a time t1
from its emission at A1. During this time t1, the photon
has traveled the path A1O2 = ct1, and the mirror, the
source and the detector have moved the distance vt1 to
the right. We have used Einstein’s second postulate that
the photon will move at a speed of light c with respect
to every inertial frame of reference.

During the time t2 from the reﬂection, the photon has
traversed the path O2B3 = ct2 being absorbed by the
detector at point B3. Accordingly, the mirror, the source
and the detector have moved the additional distance vt2
to the right. At the time of the absorption, the right edge
of the mirror was located at point R3 at a distance h ver-
tically below B3, and O3 is the location of the midpoint

of the mirror. If we denote by α the angle of incidence,
and by β the angle of reﬂection of the photon, and note
the triangle similarities in Fig. 2, we may write:

α = ∡A1O2C = ∡L1A1O2

= ∡L1A1O1 + ∡O1A1O2,
β = ∡CO2B3 = ∡O2B3R3

= ∡O2B3O3 + ∡O3B3R3.

Obviously, △A1L1O1 = △B3R3O3, and thus:

∡O3B3R3 = ∡L1A1O1.

Applying the sine theorem to △O1A1O2, we obtain:

sin ∡O1A1O2 =

sin ∡A1O1O2.

A1O2

Since O1O2 = vt1 and A1O2 = ct1, we get:

sin ∡O1A1O2 =

sin ∡A1O1O2.

Analogously, for △O2B3O3 we obtain:

sin ∡O2B3O3 =

sin ∡O2O3B3,

where we have taken into account that O2O3 = vt2 and
O2B3 = ct2. But ∡A1O1O2 = ∡O2O3B3, which we use
into Eqs. (5) and (6) to get:

∡O2B3O3 = ∡O1A1O2.

From Eqs. (1), (2), (3) and (7) we deduce α = β, that
is, the incident angle of the photon equals the reﬂected
angle. Thus, the motion of the mirror in its plane will not
aﬀect the reﬂection of the photon, and the photon will
be reﬂected in accordance with the usual law of reﬂection
as if the mirror were stationary.

where the mirror is stationary.

III. REFLECTION FROM A PLANE MIRROR
MOVING UNIFORMLY PERPENDICULAR TO
ITS SURFACE

In this section we consider the reﬂection of the photon
when the velocity of the mirror is normal to its surface.
The schematic of the reﬂection with respect to the mir-
ror’s rest frame is shown in Fig. 3. The photon is emit-
ted from a ﬁxed source at A, bounces oﬀ the mirror at
its midpoint O, and eventually hits the ﬁxed detector at
B. The source A and the detector B are located at a
vertical line ACB parallel to the mirror’s surface, being
equally distant, but at the opposite sides, from the line
OC normal to the mirror’s surface (AC = BC = ℓ). The
source A is horizontally aligned with the upper edge of
the mirror, and the detector B with its lower edge. A
simple trig reveals that the photon will be reﬂected oﬀ
the mirror at the same angle at which it was incident.

The situation with respect to the frame where the mir-
ror, the source and the detector are moving at a constant
speed v to the right is shown in Fig. 4. We will apply
the same arguments as in the previous section to derive
the formula for reﬂection of the photon in this case.

After being emitted from the moving source at time
when the source was located at A1, the photon is re-
ﬂected from the moving mirror oﬀ its midpoint O2 and
then absorbed by the moving detector at the point B3.
If t1 is the photon’s transit time from A1 to O2, and
t2 the time from O2 to B3, we have A1O2 = ct1 and
O2B3 = ct2, where we have taken into account the con-
stant speed of light postulate. At time when the photon
reaches the detector at B3, the detector has moved the
distance B1B3 = v(t1 + t2) to the right from its posi-
tion B1 when the photon was emitted from A1. From

frame moving at a constant speed v to the left.

where α and β are the incident angle and the reﬂected
angle of the photon, respectively, and b = C1O2. We
eliminate b from Eqs. (8) and (9) to get:

cos β = (cid:16)cos α − v
c (cid:17)

.

We apply the Pythagoras theorem to △A1C1O2 and
△B3C3O2 to obtain:

(ct1)2 = ℓ2 + b2,
(ct2)2 = ℓ2 + [b − v(t1 + t2)]2 ,

where ℓ = A1C1 = B3C3. By subtracting Eq. (12) from
Eq. (11) to eliminate ℓ, we obtain:

(ct1)2 − (ct2)2 = b2 − [b − v(t1 + t2)]2 .

(13)

The last equation can be factored into the form:

c2(t1 − t2)(t1 + t2) = v(t1 + t2) [2b − v(t1 + t2)] ,

(14)

which upon division by (t1 + t2) and using Eq. (8) can
be recasted into:

FIG. 5: The reﬂection angle β versus the incident angle α of
the photon for diﬀerent values of the speed v of the mirror
moving perpendicularly to its surface.

We substitute the last expression for t1/t2 into Eq. (10)
to obtain:

cos β =

−2v/c + (1 + v2/c2) cos α
1 − 2(v/c) cos α + v2/c2 .

(16)

The result gives the angle of reﬂection β of the photon
in terms of the incident angle α and the speed v of the
mirror when the mirror is moving perpendicularly to its
surface.
It exactly matches the reﬂection formula ob-
tained otherwise.4,12,16,17,18

The behavior of the reﬂected angle β as a function of
α for diﬀerent values of the speed v of the mirror is given
in Fig. 5. Note that the negative values of v correspond
to the motion of the mirror in the opposite direction to
the one given in Fig. 4. From Fig. 5 it is evident that
the reﬂected photon no longer obeys the usual law of
reﬂection, except when v = 0 which is the case when the
mirror is stationary. It is also evident that β < α when
v < 0, and β > α when v > 0.

An interesting property of the formula (16) is observed
for the case v > 0. Namely, for a given positive value for
the speed v of the mirror, there exist an interval of values
for the incident angle α of the photon (αc < α < 90◦),
for which the photon is reﬂected at angles larger than
90◦. Hence, the photon, instead of moving away from
the mirror, moves in the same general direction as the
mirror. The critical angle αc can be calculated from the
formula:

t1
t2

=

1 − v2/c2
1 − 2(v/c) cos α + v2/c2 .

(15)

cos αc =

2v/c
1 + v2/c2 ,

(17)

4

which follows from Eq. (16) by applying the condition
β = 90◦. The eﬀect is known as ”the forward reﬂection
of light”.21

this case follows from Eq. (16) in Sec. III if we simply
replace v by v cos ϕ, which is the velocity component of
the mirror that is normal to its surface:

IV. REFLECTION FROM A PLANE MIRROR
MOVING IN AN ARBITRARY DIRECTION AT
A CONSTANT VELOCITY

We may generalize the above approach to the case
when the reﬂection occurs oﬀ the mirror moving at a
speed v directed at an angle ϕ from its surface normal.
Since the motion of the mirror in its plane does not af-
fect the reﬂection (see Sec. II), the reﬂection formula in

cos β =

−2(v/c) cos ϕ + [1 + (v2/c2) cos2 ϕ] cos α
1 − 2(v/c) cos α cos ϕ + (v2/c2) cos2 ϕ

. (18)

When ϕ = 0, the motion of the mirror is perpendicular
to its surface, and Eq. (18) reduces to Eq. (16). Also,
when ϕ = 90◦, the mirror moves parallel to its surface,
and the reﬂection formula simpliﬁes to α=β.

The detailed analysis of Eq. (18) for diﬀerent values

of ϕ is left to the student as an exercise.

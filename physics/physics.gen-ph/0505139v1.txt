Abstract. A purely geometrical relativity theory results from a construction that produces
from three-dimensional space a happy uniﬁcation of Kaluza’s ﬁve-dimensional theory and
Weyl’s conformal theory. The theory can provide geometrical explanations for the following
observed phenomena, among others: (a) lifetimes of elementary particles of lengths inversely
proportional to their rest masses; (b) the equality of charge magnitude among all charged
particles interacting at an event; (c) the propensity of electrons in atoms to be seen in discretely
spaced orbits; and (d) ‘quantum jumps’ between those orbits. This suggests the possibility that
the theory can provide a deterministic underpinning of quantum mechanics like that provided
to thermodynamics by the molecular theory of gases.

This presentation is intended to show that some of the phenomena thought to be explainable
only through the process of
‘quantizing’ a classical relativistic theory can be explained,
qualitatively and to some degree quantitatively, by a purely geometrical relativity theory based
on and derived solely from the geometry of three-dimensional space.2 A simple geometric
construction applied iteratively generates new dimensions beyond the basic three of space. The
ﬁrst application produces space-time, the second produces space-time–time, and so on. Space-
time is a generalized de Sitter space. Space-time–time, in which quantum eﬀects show up, is a
happy hybrid of two notable attempts at a uniﬁed theory of gravity and electromagnetism: the
Kaluza ﬁve-dimensional geometry [3] and the Weyl conformal geometry [4]. Brought together in
this way those theories lose their undesirable properties while retaining their useful ones. That
the space-time–time geometry both induces quantum eﬀects and includes gravity (along with
other ﬁelds) calls into question the rationale behind the search for a quantum theory of gravity.
This presentation and its author might therefore be regarded as intruders from a school devoted
to “Escapes from Quantum Gravity”, conducted in a parallel universe.

The geometric construction in question can be understood initially by reference to Fig. 1,
which shows in cross section two neighboring spheres S and S′ in euclidean 3-space E3 with
centers C and C ′ the distance ds apart, and with radii R and R + dR. The angle dα in which
they intersect is found, by application of Pythagoras’ theorem to the inﬁnitesimal right triangle
in the middle, to be given by dα2 = (1/R2)(ds2 − dR2), which shows dα to be the line element
of a metric of diagonal signature + + + − on the four-dimensional manifold M4 whose points

are the 2-spheres of E3. Note that dα is invariant under conformal transformations of E3.

A more general version of the construction is exhibited in Fig. 2. Here, instead of E3 there is
a three-dimensional manifold M3 with a positive-deﬁnite riemannian metric G, whose geodesic
2-spheres are the points of M4; S and S′ are two such spheres, Q′QCC ′P P ′ is the geodesic
through their centers C and C ′, and the line element is generated as the product of the distances
(relative to a scaled radius R/ ˆR) by which P and Q are displaced when S is magniﬁed radially
by the factor 1 + dR/R and its center C is shifted a distance ds along the geodesic to C ′, which
in eﬀect converts S to S′. The line element that results is given by dτ 2 = ( ˆR/R)2(dR2 − ds2).

Deﬁning a new coordinate t by t := − ln(R/ ˆR) makes

dτ 2 = ˆR2dt2 − e2tds2,

(1)

a generalization of the de Sitter space-time metric for an empty expanding universe of uniform
radius of curvature ˆR, to which metric it reduces when M3 = E3. Thus, by means of a simple
geometric construction we have produced from (more aptly, discovered within) the geometry of
three-dimensional space the geometry of a four-dimensional space-time.
The tensor product version of the metric speciﬁed by equation (1) is

ˆG = ˆR2(dt ⊗ dt) − e2tG = ˆR2(dt ⊗ dt) − e2t(dxm ⊗ gmndxn),

(2)

where G is the metric of M3. For this space-time metric ∂t is a ‘conformal semi-Killing’ vector
ﬁeld, in the sense that L∂t ˆG = −2 e2tG, where L∂t denotes Lie diﬀerentiation along ∂t. Observing
that −e2tG = ˆG − ( ˆG∂t∂t)−1( ˆG∂t ⊗ ˆG∂t), one sees that to capture least restrictively in a generic
space-time metric ˆG on a manifold M4 the essence of the geometrical construction in question
it is suﬃcient to subject ˆG to the constraint that there exist on M4 a time-like vector ﬁeld ξ
such that Lξ ˆG = 2 [ ˆG − ( ˆGξξ)−1( ˆGξ ⊗ ˆGξ)]. It is then easy to see that, in a coordinate system
[[ xm, t ]] adapted to ξ so that ξ = ∂t, ˆG takes the form

ˆG = φ2(A + dt) ⊗ (A + dt) − e2tG

= φ2(Amdxm + dt) ⊗ (Andxn + dt) − e2t(dxm ⊗ gmndxn),

(3)

with φ, Am, and gmn independent of t.

Quantum eﬀects from a purely geometrical relativity theory

Having arrived at the space-time geometry described by the metric ˆG on the manifold
M4, we can repeat the construction, applying it this time to the geodesic 3-spheres of M4
to produce a metric on the ﬁve-dimensional manifold M5 whose points are those geodesic
3-spheres. Generalizing that metric in the manner that produced (3) we obtain

ˆG = e2ζG + ˆǫφ2(A + dζ) ⊗ (A + dζ)

= e2ζ(dxµ ⊗ gµν dxν) + ˆǫφ2(Aµ dxµ + dζ) ⊗ (Aν dxν + dζ),

referred to a coordinate system [[ xµ, ζ ]] such that ξ = ∂ζ, where now G is the space-time metric
and φ, Aµ, and gµν , the counterparts of the previous φ, Am, and gmn, are independent of ζ.
The factor ˆǫ enters because there are two kinds of spheres (hyper-hyperboloids, actually) in
space-time. Those whose points lie in spacelike directions from their centers require that ˆǫ = 1,
those whose points lie in timelike directions from their centers require ˆǫ = −1. In either case,
because the construction that produced ˆG from space-time is the same one that produced space-
time from space, it is justiﬁed, indeed unavoidable, to label the manifold M5 with the metric
ˆG a space-time–time, and to identify ζ as a temporal coordinate, albeit of a secondary nature
distinct from that of the primary time coordinate t. Ultimately the ˆǫ = ±1 distinction should
be resolved by allowing ζ to be a complex coordinate. For present purposes, however, ζ will be
kept real and ˆǫ will be 1, the points of M5 being therefore the spacelike spheres of M4.

The geometry of space-time–time is the previously mentioned happy hybrid of the Kaluza
and the Weyl geometries. As in Kaluza’s theory, A is the space-time covector potential of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld 2-form F deﬁned by F := −2 d∧A. The coordinate transformation
ζ ′ = ζ − λ, with λ independent of ζ, generates in one stroke both the electromagnetic gauge
transformation A′ = A + dλ and the Weyl conformal transformation G′ = e2λG. The geodesic
paths of ˆG are taken to be the histories of test particles. To analyze these histories for physical
content one introduces the frame system {eµ, e5} := {∂µ − Aµ ∂ζ, φ−1∂ζ} and its dual coframe
system {ωµ, ω5} := {dxµ, φ(Aµ dxµ + dζ)}, for which ˆG = e2ζ (ωµ ⊗ gµν ων) + ω5 ⊗ ω5 and e5 is
orthogonal to the eµ. The velocity ˙p of a path p : R → M5 then is expressed by ˙p = ˙pµeµ + ˙p5e5,
and one can introduce the following deﬁnitions for a test particle whose history is p:

P := ˆG ˙p = (e2ζ ˙pκgκµ)ωµ + ˙p5ω5 =: Pµωµ + P5ω5
˚m := (Pµ gµν Pν )1/2 = e2ζ ( ˙pµgµν ˙pν)1/2
q := φP 5 = φ ˙p5 = φ2(Aµ ˙pµ + ˙ζ)

Of these P and q are gauge-invariant and the others are not, although the condition ˚m = 0 is
gauge-invariant.

Taking p to be a secondarily timelike geodesic parametrized by arclength, that also is
primarily timelike in that ˙pµgµν ˙pν > 0, one has that | ˙p|2 = ˆG(p) ˙p ˙p = e2ζ ( ˙pµgµν ˙pν) + ( ˙p5)2 =
e−2ζ ˚m2 + (q/φ)2 = 1 and that ¨p = ¨pµeµ + ¨p5e5 = 0. The equation ¨pµ = 0 is equivalent to

Equation (10) shows the rate of change of the particle’s space-time momentum ˚muµ
with respect to its proper time to be governed by four ‘forces’: the Einstein–Newton force
−(˚muκ)Γκ
λuλ, the ‘Weyl force’ −˚mAµ, and the ‘Kaluza force’
(˚m)−1(q/φ)2(ln φ).µ. Equation (11) produces generic behavior of q that is exempliﬁed in
the solution q(ˆτ ) = φ tanh(ˆτ /φ), where ˆτ is secondary proper time and φ is taken to be
constant. From e−2ζ ˚m2 + (q/φ)2 = 1 follows ζ(ˆτ ) = ln(˚m(ˆτ ) cosh(ˆτ /φ)). If also Aµ = 0, then
equation (12) tells that ˚m is constant, and (8) yields τ (ˆτ ) = ˚m R e−2ζ(ˆτ ) dˆτ = (φ/˚m) tanh(ˆτ /φ),
which shows the particle’s proper lifetime to be conﬁned to the open interval (τ (−∞), τ (∞))
(= (−φ/˚m, φ/˚m)), thus associates longer lifetimes with smaller rest masses, shorter lifetimes with
larger rest masses. Noting in passing the equivalence of inertial mass and passive gravitational
mass implied by the two appearances of ˚m in the lefthand member of (10), one divides by ˚m to
obtain duµ/dτ + uκΓκ
λuλ = 0, which says that the particle’s space-time track is a geodesic of
the Einstein geometry. The particle’s coordinates xµ will in general have ˆτ dependence similar
to that of τ , in consequence of which the particle’s space-time track will have an endpoint event
E1 at which it appears suddenly, traveling with velocity (dxm/dt)(−∞) (if dt/dτ > 0), and an
endpoint event E2 at which it disappears just as suddenly, traveling with velocity (dxm/dt)(∞).
Essential features of this behavior will persist in the generic case where φ and Aµ are not
restricted. In particular, the space-time track will end at events E1 and E2, and q will grow from
−φ(E1) to 0 and on to φ(E2) and ζ will depart from and return to ∞, as ˆτ goes from −∞ to ∞.
Figure 3 is a schematic representation of a geodesic exhibiting such behavior.

In [5] the analogous equations for space-time are shown to have spherically symmetric
solutions of the ‘traversable wormhole’ type, similar to those in [6].
In the space-time–time
case, with G describing a nongravitating, static, spherically symmetric, traversable wormhole,
with A = V (r) dt, and with ln φ = U (r), numerical integration yields a variety of solutions for
which, as r → ∞, V (r) is asymptotic to a Coulomb potential Q/r. For one of these, typical of
a large class, U (r) has, for r ≥ 0, the shape shown in Fig. 4. The spacing of successive bottoms
of the potential wells of U (r), located at r = rn, n = 1, 2, 3, · · ·, is asymptotic to 2n, consistent
with rn’s growing asymptotically as n2. Figure 5 is a graph of an artiﬁcial version ¯U (r) of ln φ
with rn = n2 and potential wells of uniform depth, to be used for illustrative purposes.

Now comes a most remarkable aspect of a test particle’s space-time behavior: both as
ˆτ → −∞ and as ˆτ → ∞ the factor e2ζ that in equation (10) couples the Kaluza force to the
momentum rate becomes inﬁnite, which causes that force to inﬁnitely dominate the other three,
and to push each of the terminal events E1 and E2 toward a bottom of one of the potential wells of
ln φ. Thus a scatter plot of E1 and E2 generated by random choices of initial conditions p(0) and
˙p(0) for the test particle’s path p would show high densities near those potential well bottoms,
low densities elsewhere. Figure 6 illustrates this behavior, which clearly suggests the possibility
of a (for the present, only qualitative) deterministic underpinning of quantum mechanics like
that provided to thermodynamics by the molecular theory of gases.

As illustrated in Fig. 3, neither of the events E1 and E2 is a projection of a point on the
geodesic path p: they are only limits of such projections as ˆτ → ±∞ and ζ → ∞. This suggests
that the particle whose space-time track the projection is exists neither at or before E1 nor at or
after E2, rather exists only between E1 and E2. Think back, however, to the original conception
of events in space-time as 2-spheres in space, with t = − ln(R/ ˆR). Under this interpretation the
projection of p is a one-parameter family of spheres which converges at either of these events E

Figure 6. Sample tracks of test particles following space-time–time geodesics governed by the
artiﬁcial potential ln φ = ¯U (r) of Fig. 5 and a Coulomb potential ¯V (r) = Q/r. The particles
appear at E1, follow the track in the counterclockwise direction, and disappear at E2. In each
case E1 is at r = 1, ϕ = 0, with q = −φ(E1) = −1 and ˚m = 1. The initial angular velocities
dϕ/dt are: (a) 0.0050; (b) 0.0101; (c) 0.0151; (d) 0.0352; (e) 0.0502; (f) 0.0602. The numbers
of complete revolutions in the orbits, and the locations of E2, are (a) 1, r = 0.995545, ϕ = 212˚;
(b) 3, r = 0.992591, ϕ = 51˚; (c) 4, r = 0.993775, ϕ = 240˚; (d) 5, r = 4.00752, ϕ = 204˚;
(e) 7, r = 3.97478, ϕ = 224˚; (f) 8, r = 9.09021, ϕ = 170˚. In each case at the end q = φ(E2) ≈ 1.
Such deterministic geodesics of space-time–time can model (qualitatively, at least) quantum
behavior of electrons in atoms, of ‘quantum jumps’ between electron orbits in particular.

to the sphere S(E) centered at the spatial location of E and with the nonzero radius ˆRe−t(E).
By deﬁnition E = S(E), and therefore every test particle track that has E as one of its endpoints
would include S(E) by continuity. What is more, the full geodesic path is itself a one-parameter
family of space-time–time points, thus of (hyper-hyperboloidal) ‘spheres’ of space-time. The
3-‘sphere’ Sζ that is the point at [[ xµ, ζ ]] has as its center the spatial 2-sphere that is the event
at [[ xµ ]] in space-time. The radius of Sζ is ˆRe−ζ, which goes to zero at E. According to the
space-time metric constructed in Fig. 1, Sζ is the set of all 2-spheres that lie an angular distance
ˆRe−ζ from the central 2-sphere. This set is a union of disjoint subsets each of which is a one-
parameter family of 2-spheres all mutually tangent to one another at a single point of the central
2-sphere, which they all intersect in an angle of radian measure ˆRe−ζ. These families, which
in the conventional sense are null generators of the hyper-hyperboloid that is the 3-sphere Sζ,
are null geodesics of space-time which broadcast the location and size of the central 2-sphere,
both forward in time and backward. As ζ → ∞ the 2-spheres all become tangent to the central
sphere. Conventionally put, the hyperboloid Sζ collapses to a null cone, whose vertex is the

event corresponding to (i. e., equal to by deﬁnition) the limiting central sphere S(E). The events
on or interior to the past null cone of E1 and the future null cone of E2 receive no information
about the particle, but every other event is notiﬁed of the particle’s existence (by being an event
on a null generator of one of the hyperboloids Sζ in the space-time–time geodesic, thus by being
a 2-sphere in one of the families of mutually tangent 2-spheres whose union is Sζ). If we now
consider the test particle following the path p to in fact be a 2-sphere in space, going forward
in (primary) time by shrinking, then, because it has nonzero spatial radius at E1 and E2, the
particle can be deemed to exist there, even though it is visible only between E1 and E2.

A second test particle whose track shared with that of the ﬁrst an endpoint E would have
in common with the ﬁrst the 2-sphere S(E), thus would be, for an instant at least, the same
particle. The two particles could be thought of as extensions of one another, as well as of all
other particles that shared the endpoint E. Such an event would be an ‘interaction’ event, not
unlike a vertex in a quantum mechanical Feynman diagram. Built in to the interaction would
be that all participating charged particles have the same charge magnitude |q| = φ(E).

There is much left unreported here, but I trust that what has been reported is suﬃcient
to lend credence to the proposition that some measure of the physics of quantum phenomena
can be extracted, qualitatively and to some degree quantitatively, from the geometry of three-
dimensional space.

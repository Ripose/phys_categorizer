Dirac’s Large Number Hypothesis
and Quantized Friedman Cosmologies

James G. Gilson j.g.gilson@qmul.ac.uk ∗

July 30, 2013

Abstract

This paper contains applications of the quantum the-
ory for gravity developed in the paper A Sketch for
a Quantum Theory of Gravity. Firstly, it is shown
that the theory gives a direct derivation of the im-
plications of Dirac’s large number hypothesis. The
three dimensionless large numbers are obtained as
three closed formulae with deﬁnite coeﬃcients con-
structed from known physical constants. Secondly,
the theory is used to derive two quantum Friedman
cosmologies. The ﬁrst of these Cosmologies is a very
simple ﬁrst approximation involving a key angular
parameter being zero and the second is a more accu-
rate one involving the same key parameter not being
zero. The cosmological constant plays a basic and
fundamental part in the formalism with very accu-
rate agreement with measurement pertaining.

1 The Three Large Numbers

The paper A Sketch for a Quantum Theory of
Gravity[1], will referred to as A in this paper. The
three large numbers that appeared in the works of
Dirac[3], Eddington[6] and others[7] have been ex-
tensively discussed their meanings, possible relations
between them and their signiﬁcance has been studied
in great detail by many workers[11]. Many attempts
have been made to explain their physical philosophi-
cal position in the natural world. Generally they have
been regarded as presenting us with a great mystery
that needs to be resolved, if we are ever to under-
stand the relation between the very small world of
atoms and the very large cosmological world. The
quantum-gravitation theory developed in A does ex-
plain just how and why they occur and how they are
related. The noted three large numbers are the nu-
merical values of the quantities that are often called
the relative strength of the electrical and gravitational

forces between an electron and a proton, ξ ; the ra-
tio of the length scale associated with the universe,
c/H, [4], and the classical radius of the electron, re;
and lastly, N, the number of particles in the universe.
They are listed below in the order just mentioned.

where H is Hubble’s constant. The ﬁrst of these ξ can
be calculated from the given formula in the ﬁrst en-
try to equation (1.1) and on the basis of present day
measured values for the constants α, mp, me and G
it assumes a value of order 1039. The ﬁrst three of
these constants are from quantum measurements and
are known very accurately. The fourth, G is from as-
tronomical and other macroscopic measurements and
its value is not known to anything like the same order
of accuracy as the quantum constants. Nevertheless
the calculated value of ξ is the value cited on the
ﬁrst line of equation (1.1). I can only assume that
the suggested order of magnitude often quoted, 1040,
and displayed in the second line with a ! is wishful
thinking in attempting to see a close relation between
ξ and (c/H)/re. There seems little reason to expect
these quantities to be equal just because they have
the same large order of magnitude. On the same tack,
I cannot see that there is any reason to expect that
N is the numerical square of (c/H)/re. However,
it will next be shown that the orders of magnitude
of these quantities are derivable from the quantum-
gravitation theory in A. Thus demonstrating that
their relationships are indeed physical and not acci-
dental as some workers believe. Dirac’s large number
hypothesis, LNH, is essentially the conclusion that
these three large number valued relations between
quantum and cosmological quantities are not acci-
dental. They rather represent relations that hold for
all time throughout the whole history of the universe.
On the main interpretation of (LNH), it is implied
that G must vary inversely with epoch. Using the

2 THE FRIEDMAN METRIC

quantity ξ, we get the approximate value of NG from
experimental numerical values together with gravita-
tion theory as

ment for the current value of NG, we have

NG ≈ 3.11 × 1041.

(1.17)

Here also we get the clear representation for the num-
ber Np of protonic sized rest masses in the universe
as determined by the square of the key state quantum
number NG.

All three large numbers can thus be identiﬁed as
deﬁnite functions of the microscopic constants α, me
and mp together with c and the key quantum cos-
mological state quantum number NG. This state pa-
rameter is the source of the large numbers and the
basis of Dirac’s large number hypothesis.

The model quantum system developed in A con-
forms exactly to the Dirac large number hypothesis
and at the same time ﬁlls in the detailed construction
for the quantum theory necessary to fulﬁl that role.
All the coeﬃcients of the powers of NG involved with
the large numbers are obtained as explicit functions
of microscopic, measurable and recorded[8] experi-
mental numerical values of these physical parameters.
In the next section of this paper, it will be shown
that the theory developed in A is consistent with the
mathematical structure of the Friedman Cosmologi-
cal models. A speciﬁc quantized oscillating model is
obtained using the epoch dependent gravitation func-
tion G(t∗ cos(χG)) and the mass of the universe, MU
derived from quantum gravity theory in A.

2 The Friedman metric

The quantum theory for gravity developed in A
was formed from quantum theory based on concepts
from Bohr’s work, from Sommerfeld’s work[2], from a
theory[5] for quantum coupling constants and a time
dependent formula[9] for Newton’s gravitation con-
stant G. Thus here the term constant for G is a mis-
nomer. However, the two quantities radius and mass,
of the universe come out of that theory together with
the conclusion that the graviton has a rest mass neg-
ligibly greater than zero. An explanation for the rest
mass value for the proton as being due to graviton
kinematics also comes out of that theory. However,
apart from the input of the formula for G(t), no gen-
eral relativity theory in the form of ﬁeld equations
or metric is used as input. Thus the main question

NG = α−1ξ cos(χG(NG))
≈ 3.11 × 1041.

ξ = αNG/ cos(χG(NG)).

(1.4)

(1.5)

(1.6)

The factor cos(χG(NG)) on the right hand side of
equations (1.4) and (1.6) does not detract from the
evaluation of NG because it is so close to unity as
to be measurably indistinguishable from it. This is
because of the largeness of NG. Equation (1.4) is
just the inverse of equation (1.6) under the same un-
derstanding about the factor cos(χG(NG)). It shows
how the observed large value order of ξ is determined
by the key state integer or eigen-number, NG. Let us
now consider the second of the three observed large
numbers (c/H)/re. Within the theory we have, from
equations (3.22A) and (2.5A), its deﬁnition is,

(c/H ∗)/re = mec2t∗/(α~)

(1.8)

(1.9)

Thus here again we ﬁnd that the largeness of
(c/H)/re is determined by the key quantum integer
NG, the order of largeness of (c/H)/re is brought
down into line with ξ by the relatively small factor
in equation (1.9). Let us now consider the last large
number N , the number of particles in the universe.
This is related to the mass of the universe MU from
the theory and is given by equation (3.4A),

that arises is how does this all reﬂect on relativis-
tic cosmology theory. It will be shown here that the
quantum theory structure integrates perfectly with
standard Friedman cosmology theory.

The standard cosmological Friedman metrics are

of the form

ds2 = (cdt)2 − R2(t){

(2.1)

where R(t) is the length dimensioned scale function of
time, t and k = +1, 0, −1 is the curvature parameter
with the three indicated allowable values. The rather
simplistic meanings of these three cases are universes
that are closed , open and ﬁnite, open and inﬁnite re-
spectively, See Rindler[10] page 367 for more detail
about the parameter k. The scale factor, R(t), often
called the expansion factor is the only function that
needs to be found from the general relativity ﬁeld
equations to produce a cosmological theory. How-
ever, the form and physical structure of the theory
generated depends on input to the ﬁeld equation.
The quantum theory of gravity from A has given
the main requirements for input into the ﬁeld equa-
tions. They are the mass of the universe MU (NG), at
the present epoch as represented by the key quantum
number NG or by t∗, the gravitation constant G as a
function G(r′∗) of the radius r′∗ of a general proton’s
gravitional orbit and how this orbit with radius, r′∗,
depends on the radius of the universe, r∗. This input

The ﬁrst move is to solve the general relativity ﬁeld
equations to ﬁnd the two equations that are often
called the Friedman equation and the second equa-
tion for r(t) as a function of the time t. These equa-
tions have the forms (2.4) and (2.5),

where the quantity G on the left hand side of these
equations is the usual constant gravitation constant,
G. k is the curvature parameter that can take on the
values −1, 0, +1 and Λ is the cosmological constant.
The last equation here (2.6) is the assumption that

(2.4)

(2.5)
(2.6)

the density function ρ is capable of exerting the pres-
sure P ′. The three equations (2.4), (2.5) and (2.6)
form the usual basis for the non-quantal cosmolo-
gies that are discussed in great detail, in Rindler’s
book[10]. Other assumptions can be made at this
point which will render these equation more suitable
for describing a cosmology based on the quantum
gravity theory which was outlined in A. This will
be dealt with in the next section.

3 Expansion Process

In the quantum system developed earlier, mass is gen-
erated over time inside the expanding universe. In A,
I showed how conservation of energy for the quantum
expansion process can be seen to hold by regarding
any increase δM of mass within the outer expand-
ing boundary over some time δt, say, as arising from
mass enveloped from outside the expanding bound-
ary over the time δt, δM = cδt4πR2ρ where ρ is the
mass density just outside the expanding boundary.
It follows that the process occurring in this system
is not to be thought of as continuous creation.
It
is necessary for this development that there are two
mass densities involved ρi and ρo, ρi inside the mov-
ing spherical boundary and ρo outside the moving
boundary. In principle they can exert positive pres-
sures Pi, Po away from their regions of location, if
they are physically suitably constituted by formulae
such as Pi = c2ρi/3 and Po = c2ρo/3. Thus the
eﬀective pressure exerted outward from the expand-
ing universe on to its expanding boundary will be
Po,e = Pi − Po if the contributions from both den-
sities are taken into account. The mass density dis-
tribution, ρo outside the expanding universe, I shall
call the universe’s mass halo. It is not observationally
accessible from within the universe. The expanding
universe consumes it own halo. On the basis of these
remarks about inside and outside mass densities, we
can give a clear qualitative explanation of the nature
of the expansion process.
It can be regarded as a
spherically expanding change of state or phase tran-
sition in which the material outside the moving spher-
ical boundary in state So is continuously consumed
to reappear within the boundary in state Si. The
state inside and the state outside having characteris-
tics reﬂected in the form of equation of state. I shall
take it to be the case that the external state is that
of a continuous mass density satisfying Po = c2ρo/3
and the internal state is that of a dust distribution
with a mass density ρi = ρo, the same as the external
density at the boundary but unable to exert pressure,
Pi = 0. The change of state does not involve a change
of density. Thus the total eﬀective outwards pressure

will be the negative pressure Po,e = −Po so that we
need to replace equations ((2.4)), (2.5) and (2.6) with
the prime on P ′ now dropped,

8πGρr2/3 = ˙r2 + (k − Λr2/3)c2

−8πGP r/c2 = 2¨r + ˙r2/r + (k/r − Λr)c2,

to give a relation between r and t which is physi-
cally very good provided we do not interpret it for
the smaller values of r. This is the course that will
be taken in this article while the more involved situ-
ation for smaller values of r will be dealt with in the
next section. Thus under this restriction our integral
becomes

P = −c2ρ/3

4 The Quantum Model

I shall conﬁne the discussion in this paper to the
cases when the cosmological constant is negative,
that is Λ = −|Λ|. Using a radius variable version
of the gravitation constant, G(r′) ← G(r′/c), the
mass of the universe MU = ρ4πr3/3 and the quan-
tization projection formula, (4.2) for R, the quantity
8πG(R cos(χ))ρR2/3 on the left hand side of (2.4)
can be expressed in the form,

8πG(R cos(χ))ρR2/3 = 2(c cos2(χ))2. (4.1)

The function of r, a(k, χG(NG)), in the denomi-
nator of equation (4.8) makes for some diﬃculty in
evaluating the integral because it is not a simple func-
tion. However, for larger values of r, a(k, χG(NG)) is
indistinguishable from the pure constant a(k, 0) be-
cause the angle χG(NG) is very small for large r so
that the integration is easily performed in that case

RΛ = |3/Λ|1/2
R(t) = R0, when t = t0

(4.14)
(4.15)

(4.16)

As this solution is rigorously cyclical, while not for-
getting that the true physical case would involve
the function a(k, χG(NG)) rather than a(k, 0), we
might just as well discuss this for the simplest case
R(0) = R0, a(1, 0) = 1 and with only the plus sign in
the sine function. Then

R(t) = RΛ sin(ct/RΛ)
˙R(t) = c cos(ct/RΛ)
RΛ = |3/Λ|1/2
R(t) = 0, when t = t0 = 0

(4.17)

(4.18)
(4.19)

(4.20)

and we see that everything depends on the value as-
signed to Λ as this will determine the maximum value
for R(t) which is given by RΛ through (4.19) accord-
ing to (4.17). Thus the cosmological constant as-
sumes prime importance for this quantum cosmology
but it still remains a numerical value that does not
come out of the theory but remains rather a value
that needs to be found from experiment or observa-
tion and then input into the theoretical construction.
The value of Λ in this construction is directly related
to the ultimate radius of the universe RΛ. A list of
values for important parameters can be found in the
Wheeler book[11] on page 738, (Box 27.4). I shall use
some of this information to determine the viability of
this quantum model as representing the physically
observed or assumed values for describing the uni-
verse after considering the second Friedman equation
and some physically measurable characteristics.

If we take the diﬀerence of (2.4) and (2.5) and take

(3.1) into account we obtain successively,

Λ
¨R(t) = −ω2R(t)

ω = c/RΛ = c|3/Λ|−1/2.

Hence we have a simple harmonic universe with angu-
lar frequency parameter ω determined by the cosmo-
logical constant Λ through (4.24). Thus the accelera-
tion of this universe is negative for positive R(t) and
positive for negative R(t). The values of the three
functions of cosmic time H, Ω, q, Hubble’s constant,
the dimensionless density parameter and the dimen-
sionless deceleration parameter that are used to test
theory against observation are,

H = ˙R/R = c cot(ct/RΛ)/RΛ
Ω = 8πGρ/(3H 2) = 2(cos(χG)RΛ/R)2

(4.26)

q = − ¨R/(RH 2) = tan2(ct/RΛ).

(4.27)

(4.28)

The quantum model cosmology could not be more
simple than that described by the function R(t) above
where the cosmological constant Λ is a free input pa-
rameter not determined through the present theory.
Thus all that remains to be shown is that it can be
assigned a value that gives good agreement for the
values of other cosmological quantities that have been
measured at the present epoch. The most important
of these is the cosmological present day radius of the
universe which is derived in the quantum gravitation
theory to be given by ct∗ = 2.18c × 1017m. However
the present day age of the universe can not now be
taken to be t∗ = 2.18 × 1017s because the relation be-
tween time and radius has now been shown to have
the more involved form (4.17). In order to make this
distinction between possible representations of ages
of the universe let us now denote the cosmological
quantum age or epoch by t† and regard t∗ as a for-
mal age or just the time a light ray at velocity c would
take to transverse the radius if that kept constant at
the value, r∗. The most important physical quanti-
ties of the present day universe at their present day
epoch values are, Hubble’s constant H(t†) and R(t†)
given below with their measured values. We can solve
the two equations (4.29) and (4.30) to obtain the val-
ues for RΛ, Λ and t† given at equations (4.31), (4.32)

and (4.33).

The simple formula (4.17) together with the value
for the constant maximum radius RΛ gives a model
for a quantum cosmology that agrees with the ex-
perimental information available with high accuracy.
The numerical value for RΛ depends only on the value
assumed for the cosmological constant Λ. Thus here
there is no question of whether the cosmological con-
stant is important or not, its value and existence is
fundamental and crucial to this quantum version of
cosmology. The version for the model developed here
has not taken into account the mostly near zero angle
χG which will have more importance for small values
of epoch. This will be dealt with in the next section.
However, the approximate model that has been de-
veloped here does give all the essential feature of a
quantum model for larger epoch values. The main
feature is that the model is cyclical or simple har-
monic with a period of approximately 4.9×1010 years.
It is interesting that the that the ratio of maximum
radius to radius now is RΛ/R(t†) = 1.126 whereas
the ratio time at maximum radius to time now is
tΛ/t† = 1.436. This means that radius-wise now we
are relatively quit near to the turn round point when
contraction begins but time-wise that turn round is
some way in the future.

It has been demonstrated that that the quantum
theory for gravity obtained in A is consistent with the
mathematical structure of the Friedman Cosmologi-
cal models. The speciﬁc quantized oscillating model
was obtained using the epoch dependent gravitation
function G(t∗ cos(χG)) and the mass of the universe,
MU derived from quantum theory. However, that
model was restricted to an unspeciﬁed range of ra-
dius values vaguely called large. This was necessary
because of problems with the evaluation of a key in-
tegral. In the next section this restriction to range
is lifted and the angle χG is taken to be nonzero to
give a model valid over a very large range of values
for the epoch changing universe radius.

5 A SECOND QUANTUM

FRIEDMAN COSMOLOGY

6

5 A Second Quantum

Friedman Cosmology

The quantum theory for gravity developed in A was
formed from quantum theory based on concepts from
Bohr’s work, from Sommerfeld’s work, from a theory
for quantum coupling constants and a time depen-
dent formula for Newton’s gravitation constant G.
The author’s theory for the quantum coupling con-
stants depends on quantum and relativity concepts
introduced via an idea called projection quantization.
Projection quantization is more familiar in quantum
studies in relation to angular momentum. However,
it is used in this work in relation to the ordinary ge-
ometry of spatial lengths and spatial angles and eﬀec-
tively supplies a bridge between length quantization
and relativity length contraction. It comes into the
quantization of gravitation via the formula,

r∗ cos(χG(NG)) = NGl′′
p
p = lp/ cos2(χG(nG))
l′′

(5.1)

(5.2)

r∗ is to be identiﬁed with the present day radius
of the universe and lp is the crossed Compton wave
length of the proton ~/(mpc). The quantity r′∗ =
r∗ cos(χG(NG)) is the radius of the very large radius
gravitational orbit that any proton exists on as a con-
sequence of being part of the universe and subject to
the gravitational inﬂuence of the rest of the universe.
The gravitational orbit of the general proton under
the gravitational attraction of the rest of the universe
is exactly analogous to the orbit of an electron in the
electromagnetic orbit of a hydrogen-like atom under
the Coulomb potential of its nucleus. The analogue
of the quantity cos(χG(NG)) = NGαG is the quan-
tum electromagnetic quantity cos(χ137) = 137α in
the case of hydrogen137. This is all explained in great
detail in A. In the previous section, the Friedman cos-
mological equations from general relativity were used
to derive a quantum cosmological model and it was
shown that the numerical value of the cosmological
constant could be chosen together with identiﬁcations
involving the measured value of G to give very accu-
rate model agreement with present day astronomi-
cal measurement. The steps involved in deriving this
quantum model universe depended on performing an
integration of the Friedman equations which was car-
ried out under the assumption that cos(χG(NG)) = 1.
This assumption is in fact very accurately correct and
increasingly so for values of NG > 137 as can be
seen by using the general coupling constant formula
which gives cos(χ) = 137α ≈ 1 − 0.000263. Thus
the ﬁrst and second models could be said to be reli-
able for NG > 137 or equivalently for r∗ > 137lp ≈

2.9 × 10−14 < 10 × 10−14 = 10−13 meters.
It fol-
lows that for a range of radius values ranging from
the subatomic 10−13 m to the ultimate radius of the
universe the ﬁrst model is valid. However, it still re-
mains very interesting to explore just what the eﬀect
on the model would be by taking the projection co-
sine cos(χG(nG)) not equal to unity but rather taking
it to have an acceptable dependence on r∗ and then
performing the integration in that case. It is also de-
sirable to carry through the more general case just in
case there are unexpected nasty surprises such as sin-
gularities that would have been missed in the simple
case. It turns out that this can be done as will now
be shown. Firstly, for ease of reference here at (5.4)

as χG(NG)) is very small. Using the power 2 rather
than 4 only makes a very small diﬀerence to the con-
stant function B(RΛ) that appears at formula (5.15).
I shall restrict the discussion to what is called the
closed universe case k = 1 so that the ﬁrst need is
to ﬁnd an r variable function to replace the quantity
a(1, χG(NG)). This can be achieved as follows,

a(1, χG(NG)) ≈ (2 cos2(χG(NG)) − 1)

≈ cos(2χG(NG))
≈ cos(2π/NG) ≈ 1 − 2(π/NG)2

NG ≈ r∗/lp

a(1, χG(NG)) ≈ 1 − 2(πlp/r∗)

Four approximation steps are used in getting to the
ﬁnal form (5.9). Each of these approximations are
accurate for all NG and very accurate indeed for
NG > 137. Thus one can have great conﬁdence in
the ﬁnal formula (5.9) as usable in the integral 5.4.

the gravitation constant, r∗(t†) = r(t†), and the ex-
perimental value for Hubble’s constant H(t†) at time
t† can be used in this equation to give an equation,
F Q(t†) = 0 from which the value of RΛ and hence
the value of Λ can be obtained.

6 Conclusions

The formula (5.12) together with the value for the
constant maximum radius RΛ gives a model for a
quantum cosmology that agrees with the experimen-
tal data to high accuracy. RΛ is calculated from the
theory and in turn determines the value of the cosmo-
logical constant, Λ. The second model has taken into
account the mostly near zero projection angle, χG, in
contrast to the ﬁrst model. This more in depth study
has not shown up any dangerous physical or math-
ematical complications such as singularities. Impor-
tantly, there is no big bang. The main feature is that
the model is smoothly cyclical or simple harmonic
with a period of approximately 2.442108 × 1010 years
in contrast with the 4.48888727 × 1010 years from
the ﬁrst model, apparently twice as long to complete
a full cycle. This is in fact not an indication of a
great diﬀerence between the two models.
It partly
arises because we are not comparing like with like.
The radius in the ﬁrst model depends on a sine func-
tion whereas in the second model the radius squared
depend on a similar sine function at twice the fre-
quency. Eﬀectively, this means that the second sine
wave appears as the modulus of the ﬁrst sine wave so
that over the period the negative values of the ﬁrst

sine wave are sign inverted. Thus one complete cy-
cle of the ﬁrst model corresponds to two complete
cycles of the second model. One may view the sec-
ond model as having the physical advantage of only
giving positive values for r over its complete cycle
unlike the situation for the ﬁrst model that allows
negative r for its second half cycle. This factor 2 is
a consequence of diﬀerent mathematical representa-
tions of two similar systems. The physical diﬀerence
associated with this aspect is more reﬂected in the
fact that this factor is not exactly 2. The observa-
tion that the ratio of maximum radius to radius now
is rmax/r(t†) = 1.1255648 whereas the ratio time at
maximum radius to time now is tmax/t† = 1.4359054
is much the same as in the ﬁrst model with the same
implication that radius-wise now we are relatively
quit near to the turn round point when contraction
begins but time-wise that turn round is some way in
the future. The rest of the numerical comparisons in
list (5.31)→ (5.46) show close similarity for the two
models. However, one should recognise that the small
diﬀerences in the decimal parts of the various param-
eter tend rather to hide the great diﬀerences in value
that are really involved. For example, the numerical
diﬀerence between t′† and t† is 1.5505×1013 s ≈ 5463
life-spans. From a human perspective this is a long
time. Perhaps the most interesting result from these
quantum models is that there is no Big Bang and
conservation of energy still rules.

Abstract

In this paper, we argue that the elusive magnetic monopole arises
due to the strong magnetic eﬀects arising from the non commutative
space time structure at small scales.If this structure is ignored and we
work with Minkowski spacetime, then the magnetic eﬀect shows up as
a monopole. This would also explain why the monopole has eluded
detection even after seventy years. We next consider another area in
which Solitons can be applied, viz., Bose Einstein condensation.

1 Introduction

Non linear wave equations and solitons have been studied for a long time.
Let us consider some less well known application of solitons. We start
with monopoles. Ever since Dirac deduced theoretically the existence of the
monopole in 1931, it has eluded physicists [1]. At the same time the possibil-
ity of realising huge amounts of energy using monopoles has been an exciting
prospect. In 1980 when the ﬁftieth Anniversary of the monopole was being
commemorated, Dirac himself expressed his belief that the monopole did not
exist [2]. Some scholars have indeed dismissed the monopole [3, 4], while in
a model based on quantized vortices in the hydrodynamical formulation, the
monopole ﬁeld can be mathematically identiﬁed with the momentum vector
[5]. Monopoles had also been identiﬁed with solitons [6].
In any case, it has been noted that the existence of free monopoles would
lead to an unacceptably high density of the universe [7], which in the light
of latest observations of an ever expanding universe [8, 9] would be diﬃcult

1

to reconcile.
We will now show that monopoles arise due to the non commutative struc-
ture of space time being ignored, and this would also provide an explanation
for their being undetected.

2 The Monopole

Let us start by reviewing Dirac’s original derivation of the Monopole (Cf.ref.[1]).
He started with the wave function

ψ = Aeıγ,

ψ = ψ1eıS,

κµ = ∂µS

He then considered the case where the phase γ in (1) is non integrable. In
this case (1) can be rewritten as

where ψ1 is an ordinary wave function with integrable phase, and further,
while the phase S does not have a deﬁnite value at each point, its four
gradient viz.,

is well deﬁned. We use natural units, ¯h = c = 1. Dirac then goes on to iden-
tify κ in (3) (except for the numerical factor hc/e) with the electromagnetic
ﬁeld potential, as in the Weyl gauge invariant theory.
Next Dirac considered the case of a nodal singularity, which is closely related
to what was later called a quantized vortex (Cf. for example ref.[10]). In this
case a circuit integral of a vector as in (3) gives, in addition to the electro-
magnetic term, a term like 2πn, so that we have for a change in phase for a
small closed curve around this nodal singularity,

2πn + e

~B · d~S

Z
In (4) ~B is the magnetic ﬂux across a surface element d~S and n is the num-
ber of nodes within the circuit. The expression (4) directly leads to the
Monopole.
Let us now reconsider the above arguments in terms of recent developments.

The Dirac equation for a spin half particle throws up a complex or non Her-
mitian position coordinate. Dirac identiﬁed the imaginary part with Zitter-
bewegung eﬀects and argued that this would be eliminated once it is realized
that in Quantum Mechanics, space time points are not meaningful and that
on the contrary averages over intervals of the order of the Compton scale
have to be taken to recover meaningful physics [11]. Over the decades the
signiﬁcance of such cut oﬀ space time intervals has been stressed by T.D.
Lee and several other scholars [12, 13, 14, 15]. Indeed with a minimum cut
oﬀ length l, it was shown by Snyder [16] that there would be a non commu-
tative space time structure, and infact at the Compton scale we would have
(Cf.ref.[15])

[x, y] = 0(l2)

(5)

and similar relations. The Planck scale ofcourse, is the Compton scale for a
Planck mass.
Infact starting from the Dirac equation itself, we can deduce directly the non
commutativity (5) as recently shown [17]. This non commutative feature
has also been recently stressed, both in Quantum Gravity and in Quantum
SuperStrings theory [18, 19].
Let us now return to Dirac’s formulation of the monopole in the light of the
above comments. As noted above, the non integrability of the phase S in (2)
gives rise to the electromagnetic ﬁeld, while the nodal singularity gives rise
to a term which is an integral multiple of 2π. As is well known [20] we have

where ~p is the momentum vector. When there is a nodal singularity, as noted
above the integral over a closed circuit of ~p does not vanish. Infact in this
case we have a circulation given by

Γ =

~∇S · d~r = ¯h

dS = 2πn

I

I

It is because of the nodal singularity that though the ~p ﬁeld is irrotational,
there is a vortex - the singularity at the central point associated with the
vortex makes the region multiply connected, or alternatively, in this region
we cannot shrink a closed smooth curve about the point to that point. Infact
if we use the fact as seen above that the Compton wavelength is a minimum

~∇S · d~r =

~p · d~r = 2πmc

(8)

(l = ¯h
2mc is the radius of the circuit and h = 2π in the above natural units).
In other words the nodal singularity or quantized vortex gives us the mysteri-
ous Quantum Mechanical spin half (and other higher spins for other values of
n). In the case of the Quantum Mechanical spin, there are 2×n/2+1 = n+1
multiply connected regions, exactly as in the case of nodal singularities. In-

deed in the case of the Dirac wave function, which is a bi-spinor

it is well known that far outside the Compton wavelength, it is the usual
spinor Θ, preserving parity under reﬂections that predominates, whereas at
and near the Compton scale it is the spinor φ which predominates, where
under a reﬂection φ goes over to −φ. This double connectivity of the Dirac
spinor was shown to lead immediately to the same electromagnetic potential
we had obtained from the nonintegrability of the phase above, which again
was identical to that from Weyl’s gauge invariant theory (Cf.ref.[21] for de-
tails).
Let us see all this in a little greater detail [22]. We start with a non integrable
inﬁnitessimal parallel displacement of a four vector,

δaσ = −Γσ

µνaµdxν

The Γ’s are the Christoﬀel symbols. This represents the extra eﬀect in dis-
placements, due to curvature. In a ﬂat space, all the Γ’s on the right side
would vanish. Considering partial derivatives with respect to the µ-th coor-
dinate, this would mean that, due to (9),

∂aσ
∂xµ →
The second term on the right side of (10) can be written as

∂aσ
∂xµ − Γσ

µνaν,

(10)

where we have linearised the metric,

µνgν

λaσ = −Γν

µνaσ,

gµν = ηµν + hµν,

ηµν being the Minkowski metric and hµν a small correction whose square is
neglected. From (10) we conclude that,

We can identify

monopole theory.
If we use (11), we will get the commutator relation,

Let us now use (12) in (13): The right side does not vanish due to the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld (12) and we have a non-commutativity of the momentum
components of quantum theory. Indeed the left side of (13) can be written
as

l being the Compton wavelength. In (14) we have utilised the fact that at the
extreme scale of the Compton wavelength, the Planck scale being a special
case, the momentum is mc.

[pλ, pµ] ≈

where B is the magnetic ﬁeld.
Equation (15) is the well-known equation for the magnetic monopole. Indeed
it has been shown by Saito and the author [23, 22] that a non commutative
spacetime at the extreme scale shows up as a powerful magnetic ﬁeld.
To recapitulate, the Monopole was shown by Dirac to arise because of two
separate issues. The ﬁrst was the non integrability of the phase S given in
(2), which gave rise to the electromagnetic potential (3) which was equiva-
lent to the Weyl potential (12) (which latter was dismissed because it was
adhoc). The other issue was that of nodal singularities or alternatively the

5

multiply connected nature of space which gave rise to a term like 2πn as in
(4). In eﬀect there would be free monopoles. However all this was considered
in the context of the usual commutative Minkowski spacetime. Eﬀectively
this means that terms ∼ 0(l2) as in (5) are neglected.
However once such terms are included, in other words once the non commu-
tative structure of spacetime to this order is recognised, ﬁrstly the previously
supposedly adhoc Weyl electromagnetic formulation automatically follows as
in (12) and furthermore the ﬁrst term in the monopole expression (4) im-
mediately gives the Quantum Mechanical spin, and the elusive monopole
appears as the magnetic eﬀect at the Compton (or Planck scale). Indeed in
recent times the fact that non commutative spacetime gives rise to spin has
been recognized [24, 17].

3 Non linear Equations

Let us now come to non linear wave equation. In diverse areas of physical
application a non-linearity leads to what may be called auto catalysis or auto
production. For example in the well known trimolecular model (Brusselator)
a cubic non-linearity is required in the rate equations[25]. In fact the non-
linearity has to be at least of the order three. The rate equations are then of
the form

∂X
∂t

= K1A − (K2B + K4)X + K3X 2Y + D1∇2

rX,

and a companion equation, where the symbols have the usual signiﬁcance.
Such a process is also well known in the upper atmosphere, in the formation
of the triple oxygen molecule, ozone[26]:

O + O2 + m → O3 + m.

It is also known that the rate equations in a number of biochemical reactions
involving enzyme catalysis also exhibit in some limiting cases, cubic terms,
for example the Glycolytic pathway (Cf.[25]).
In fact, in most problems of cooperative phenomena physics, for example
plasmas or lasers, at least cubic non-linearities are required for such cooper-
ative behaviour.

6

In other areas, such as zoology or biology or sociology too non-linearities
cause auto production[27, 28] (Cf.
for a non technical discussion). A very
well-known example is the logistic equation.
There is a similar situation in quantum ﬁeld theory also[29]. It is not sur-
prising that auto catalysis or auto production should be a non-linear feature.
In fact for a linear system not only ψ but also αψ is a solution.
However if the system is non-linear, it can be written as

M(ψ) = L(ψ) + N(ψ) = 0,

where L denotes the linear part and N the non-linear part. In a ﬁrst approx-
imation, we can take

L(ψ0) = 0,
and N can be linearized by suitably substituting ψ0 for ψ to get, say, L(0)(ψ).
The system would now be approximately described by the linear equation

[L + L(0)](ψ) = 0.

This process, if convergent can be continued. At each stage, the coeﬃcients
of ψ would depend on the linear approximation of up to that stage. This
precisely is the characteristic of auto production.
A similar technique has been used recently for a Ricatti equation derived
from the Schrodinger equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics[30].

4 The Non-linear Schrodinger Equation

In the light of the above comments, a non-linear Schrodinger equation was
deduced and used to argue that the origin of inertial mass lies in self inter-
acting amplitudes within, typically the Compton wavelength[31, 32, 33, 34].
A cubic non-linearity associated with auto catalysis is responsible for the
generation of the inertial mass.
In this case the equation is given by

where

If next in an equation like (17), the amplitude for a particle at r′ to be at r
vanishes outside a small interval, so that a δ function can be introduced in
(17), then we have the equation

Eψ = −

∇2ψ + gψ3

Let us now consider partial wave decomposition equation (18) in spherical
symmetry. This gives

[

d2
dr2 + k2 −

l(l + 1

], u = gu3, k2 =

2m
¯h2 E

Further specializing to the case l = 0 and k2 ≈ 0 and in the spirit of the
considerations in Section 1, neglecting the cubic term in (19), we have in the
zeroeth approximation for u, u ≈ r. Now writing in (20), u3 as u2 · u, that is
linearizing equation (20) and using the zeroeth approximation we get

[

(21)

d2
dr2 + (k2 − r2)]u = 0(k2 ≈ 0)
Equation (21) is the well known Harmonic Oscillator equation with de-
generate energy levels[35]. As is well known, a set of Harmonic oscilla-
tors as above represents an assembly of Bosons. Thus we have a collec-
tion of closely packed nearly zero energy Bosons similar to the Bose-Einstein
condensation[36].
Interestingly the link between Solitons arising from the non-linear equa-
tions and Bose-Einstein condensation is being investigated, for example by
Khaykovich and co-workers at the ENS Laboratory in Paris and also at the
European Laboratory for Non-linear Spectrascopy in Italy. In these experi-
ments a Bose-Einstein condensate of a dilute atomic gas of Lithium atoms is
used, the inter atomic interaction providing the non-linearity. This in turn
ensures the Solitonic propagation[37].
All this could have varied applications in ﬁelds ranging from Particle Physics
to Non-linear Optics, including the possibility of high speed ﬁbre optic com-
munication.

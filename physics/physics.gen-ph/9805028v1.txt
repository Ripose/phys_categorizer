ABSTRACT

Since the shape of a free body’s worldline is deter-
mined by the geometry of spacetime a local change
of spacetime geometry will aﬀect a body’s worldline,
i.e. a body’s state of motion. The exploration of this
possibility constitutes a radically new approach to
the idea of how a body can be propelled: instead of
applying a force to the body itself, the geometry of
spacetime is subjected to a local manipulation which
in turn results in the body’s motion.

INTRODUCTION

It is the geometry of spacetime that determines
the shape of a free body’s worldline. If spacetime is
ﬂat, a straight worldline represents a body moving
by inertia - the body is moving with a constant ve-
locity and its motion is non-resistant. If spacetime
is curved, a non-resistant (inertial) motion is repre-
sented by a geodesic worldline. In this case a body
moving along a geodesic worldline (for instance, a
falling body) oﬀers no resistance to moving with ac-
celeration with respect to a given reference frame
(the Earth’s surface, for example). It follows from
here that if we can change the geometry of spacetime
locally, we can change the shape of a body’s geodesic
worldline which is equivalent to making a body move
without subjecting it to any force. Such a force-free
motion is non-resistant no matter whether it is ac-
celerated since the body continues to move along its
geodesic worldline which has a diﬀerent shape in the
locally changed spacetime geometry.

The essential information concerning spacetime
geometry is given by Riemann curvature tensor - if
it is zero the spacetime is ﬂat, otherwise it is curved.

The nature of spacetime curvature, however, has
been an unsolved puzzle in physics. In this paper
an approach based on the classical electromagnetic
mass theory which provides an insight into what the
curvature of spacetime may mean is outlined.

One of the consequences of general relativity is
that the velocity of electromagnetic signals (or sim-
ply the velocity of light) in the vicinity of massive ob-
jects is anisotropic; it is believed that this anisotropy
is caused by the spacetime curvature. Using the
anisotropic speed of light in the calculation of the
self-force with which each non-inertial elementary
charged particle (an electron, for example) acts upon
itself on account of its own electric ﬁeld leads to the
following consequences. Due to the anisotropy of
the speed of light the electric ﬁeld of an electron on
the Earth’s surface is distorted which gives rise to a
self-force originating from the interaction of the elec-
tron’s charge with its distorted electric ﬁeld. This
self-force tries to force the electron to move down-
wards and coincides with what is traditionally called
a gravitational force. The electric self-force is pro-
portional to the gravitational acceleration g and the
coeﬃcient of proportionality is the mass ”attached”
to the electron’s electric ﬁeld which proves to be
equal to the electron’s mass.
In such a way the
electron’s passive gravitational mass turns out to be
purely electromagnetic in origin. This means that
the only intrinsic property of an electron is its charge
(and the resulting electromagnetic ﬁeld). The mass
of an electron is a secondary property correspond-
ing to the energy stored in the electron’s electromag-
netic ﬁeld. Simply put, there is no mass; there are
only charges and electromagnetic ﬁelds.

The anisotropy of the speed of light is compen-
sated if an electron is falling toward the Earth’s sur-

1

face with an acceleration g.
In other words, the
electron is falling in order to keep its electric ﬁeld
not distorted. A Coulomb (not distorted) ﬁeld does
not give rise to any self-force acting on the electron;
that is why the motion of a falling electron is non-
resistant as general relativity predicts. If an electron
is prevented from falling it can no longer compensate
the anisotropy of spacetime, its ﬁeld distorts and as
a result a self-force pulling the electron downwards
arises.

Therefore the anisotropic speed of light around
objects and the electromagnetic mass approach fully
account for the gravitational properties of charged
particles. In fact, this approach fully explains the
gravitational attraction between bodies as well since
the constituents of the neutron are also charged sub-
particles (quarks). This is an indication that the
anisotropy of spacetime (manifesting itself in the
anisotropy in the propagation of electromagnetic sig-
nals) is not caused by a curvature of spacetime (since
no curvature hypothesis is necessary) but itself can
be interpreted as a curvature or as a gravitational
ﬁeld.
In such a way, it turns out that Riemann
curvature tensor, in fact, describes the spacetime
anisotropy.

As an electron’s passive gravitational mass in this
approach is electromagnetic, its active gravitational
mass, being equal to its passive gravitational mass,
is electromagnetic too. And since it is the active
gravitational mass of an electron that produces its
gravitational ﬁeld, i.e. the anisotropy of spacetime
around the electron, it follows that the spacetime
anisotropy originates from the electron’s charge and
electric ﬁeld (since an electron possesses only charge
and electric ﬁeld). This means that the anisotropy
of spacetime and therefore the spacetime geometry
itself are locally in principle controllable since it is
the charge and the electric ﬁeld of an electron that
cause the anisotropy of spacetime in its vicinity∗.

The behaviour of an electron in an accelerated
reference frame is identical to that of an electron in
the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld (the anisotropy in the
speed of light in this case is caused by the frame’s
accelerated motion). The electromagnetic ﬁeld of
an accelerated electron is distorted which results in
an electromagnetic self-force acting upon the elec-
tron and resisting its accelerated motion. It is pro-

∗The controllability of spacetime geometry is a direct con-
sequence of the fact that the sources of spacetime anisotropy
(charges and electric ﬁelds), being electromagnetic phenom-
ena themselves, are in principle controllable.

portional to the electron’s acceleration, the coef-
ﬁcient of proportionality being exactly its electro-
magnetic mass1−10 (i.e. the mass ”attached” to its
electromagnetic ﬁeld). In such a way, like gravita-
tion and the passive gravitational mass, inertia and
the inertial mass of an electron also turn out to be
electromagnetic in nature†. And if we can control
other electromagnetic phenomena nothing in princi-
ple prevents us from doing so to inertia and gravi-
tation as well.

The approach followed in this paper leads to and
conﬁrms the basic results of recent publications by
B. Haisch, A. Rueda and H. Puthoﬀ11−14 regarding
the electromagnetic nature of inertia and gravita-
tion.
In their view inertia and gravitation result
from interactions between the electromagnetic zero-
point ﬁeld and the elementary charged particles of
matter. The fact that Haisch, Rueda and Puthoﬀ’s
zero-point ﬁeld approach and the source-ﬁeld ap-
proach of this paper, which are in fact complimen-
tary, come up with the same interpretation of inertia
and gravitation can hardly be a pure coincidence.

In the sections which follow the anisotropic veloc-
ity of light in a gravitational ﬁeld is calculated and
it is shown that taking it into account in the calcu-
lation of the electric ﬁeld of an electron in a gravi-
tational ﬁeld fully accounts for the electron’s grav-
itational properties. The calculation of the electric
potential, electric ﬁeld and the self-force of a non-
inertial electron is non-covariant since the physics is
more transparent in this case; a covariant formula-
tion is easily obtainable10. At this stage it appears
that quantum mechanical treatment of the electro-
magnetic mass is not possible since quantum me-
chanics does not oﬀer a model for the quantum ob-
ject.

ANISOTROPIC VELOCITY OF LIGHT

In order to determine the expression for the
anisotropic speed of light in the Earth’s vicinity
let us consider three points A, B and C on the x
axis along the radial direction (when the origin of
the Cartesian coordinates coincides with the Earth’s
center all coordinate axes x, y and z have radial di-
rections). Light signals originate from point B and

†What part of the mass is electromagnetic is an open ques-
tion now. It is an accepted fact, however, that at least part of
the mass of every charged particle is electromagnetic in origin.
It has not been realized so far that an immediate consequence
of this fact is that both inertia and gravitation prove to be at
least partly electromagnetic as well.

point C situated bellow B at the same distance r.
To determine the speed of light at A an C as seen
from B we need the ratios of the length intervals at
A, B an C. In Cartesian coordinates the interval in
a gravitational ﬁeld is15:

the light to travel the distance dXA (at A), which is
the proper length of A. Two observers at A and B
agree that the distance at A has the magnitude of
dXA. Using (1) we have for the speed of light at A

GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION
WITHOUT A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD

To demonstrate that the anisotropic speed of light
in the Earth’s vicinity fully accounts for the gravi-
tational properties of an electron, as discussed in
the introduction, let us ﬁrst consider a stationary
electron in a non-inertial frame N g at rest on the
Earth’s surface. The electron’s potential and elec-
tric ﬁeld are distorted due to the anisotropic velocity
of light (3). In order to calculate the force of repul-
sion between two charge elements de and de1 of a
non-inertial electron (at rest in N g) we have to ﬁnd
the potential of a charge element de. The anisotropic

speed of light (3) leads to two changes in the scalar
potential (4) of an inertial charge element de:

can be directly calculated by using only the scalar
potential (7):

The second change in (4) is a Li´enard-Wiechert-
like contribution to the scalar potential which has
not been noticed up to now. It is analogous to the
Li´enard-Wiechert potentials resulting from an ap-
parently larger dimension of a moving charge (in the
direction of its motion) as viewed by an inertial ob-
server I 16−19. In N g the electron is at rest but a
volume element of it is apparently diﬀerent from the
actual volume element dV due to the anisotropic ve-
locity of light (3). The anisotropic volume element
(which contains the Li´enard-Wiechert-like term) in
N g arises from the diﬀerent average velocities of
electromagnetic signals originating from the rear end
and the front end of the charge element de (with re-
spect to the observation point), and is given by10:

(11)

where mg here is interpreted as the electron’s pas-
sive gravitational mass. The self-force Fg
self which
acts upon an electron on account of its own dis-
torted ﬁeld is directed parallel to g and resists its
acceleration arising from the fact that the electron
(at rest on the Earth’s surface) is prevented from
falling, i.e.
from moving by inertia. This force is
traditionally called a gravitational force but as we
have seen Fg
self in (11) is purely electromagnetic in
origin. This result explains why general relativity
predicts that there is no gravitational force. The
spacetime anisotropy around the Earth is suﬃcient
to account for the force an electron on the Earth’s
surface is subjected to; this force, however, is not
gravitational but electromagnetic.

The famous factor of 4/3 in the electromagnetic
mass of the electron does not appear in (11). The
reason is that in (9) we have used the correct vol-
ume element dV g
dV1. This apparent
−
change of the volume element originates from the
anisotropic speed of light in a non-inertial frame and
taking it into account naturally removes the 4/3-
factor without resorting to the Poincar´e stresses (de-
signed to explain the stability of the electron). Since
its origin a century ago the electromagnetic mass
theory of the electron has not been able to explain
why the electron is stable (what holds its charge
together). This failure has been used as evidence
against regarding its entire mass as electromagnetic;
it has been assumed that part of the electron mass
originates from forces holding the electron charge
together (known as Poincar´e stresses). However,
the problem of stability of the electron cannot be
adequately addressed until a quantum-mechanical
model of the electron structure is obtained. On the
other hand, this problem can be successfully avoided
in the case of the electromagnetic mass derived from
the expression for the momentum of the electron’s
electromagnetic ﬁeld8, 9. The stability problem does
not interfere, as we have seen, with the derivation of
the expression for the self-force containing the elec-
tromagnetic mass either. This hints that perhaps
there is no real problem with the stability of the elec-
tron (as a future quantum mechanical model of the
electron itself may ﬁnd); if there were one it would
inevitably emerge in the calculation of the self-force.
General relativity describes an electron falling in a
gravitational ﬁeld by a geodesic worldline. It implies
that it moves by inertia and its Coulomb ﬁeld should
not be distorted which means that there should not
exist any self-force acting on the electron. The elec-

tron’s Coulomb ﬁeld is not distorted as viewed by an
inertial observer I falling with the electron. In or-
der to obtain the electric ﬁeld of an accelerated elec-
tron falling in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld (a = g)
with respect to a non-inertial observer (at rest in
N g) we cannot use the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials
in N g since they are valid only in an inertial refer-
ence frame (N g is a non-inertial frame). Due to the
anisotropic speed of light (3) in N g they must in-
clude the Li´enard-Wiechert-like term, contained in
the potential (7):

(14)

It follows from (14) that both an inertial observer
(falling with the electron) and a non-inertial ob-
server (at rest in N g) detect a Coulomb ﬁeld of the
electron falling in N g.
In other words, while the
electron is falling in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld
its electric ﬁeld at any instant is the Coulomb ﬁeld
which means that no force is acting on the electron,
i.e. there is no resistance to its accelerated motion.
This result sheds light on the fact that in general

‡The only reason for considering the instantaneous electric
ﬁeld is to separate the deformation of the electric ﬁeld due to
the Lorentz contraction from the distortion caused by the
acceleration.

5

relativity the motion of a body falling toward a grav-
itating center is regarded as inertial (non-resistant)
and is described by a geodesic worldline. Now we are
in a position to answer the question why an electron
is falling in a gravitational ﬁeld and no force is caus-
ing its acceleration. As (14) shows, the only way
for an electron to compensate the anisotropy in the
propagation of the electromagnetic signals (respon-
sible for the repulsion force each volume element of
it is subjected to) and to keep its electric ﬁeld not
distorted is to fall with an acceleration g.
If the
electron is prevented from falling its electric ﬁeld dis-
torts due to the anisotropic speed of light and the
self-force (11) appears. It tries to force the electron
to move (fall) in such a way that its ﬁeld becomes
the Coulomb ﬁeld and as a result the self-force dis-
appears.

−

We have, on the one hand, the result (14) which
demonstrates that a Coulomb ﬁeld is associated
with a falling electron by both an inertial observer
I (falling with the electron) and a non-inertial ob-
server at rest in N g. On the other hand, compar-
ing the electric ﬁeld (8) of an electron at rest in
N g(determined in N g) and its ﬁeld19, 20 determined
in I, in which the electron is instantaneously at rest
g) shows that for both
(having an acceleration a =
an observer in I and an observer in N g the elec-
tron’s ﬁeld is equally distorted. This result reveals
that there exists a unique connection between the
shape of the electric ﬁeld of an electron and its iner-
tial state: if an electron is represented by a geodesic
worldline (which means that it moves by inertia) its
ﬁeld is the Coulomb ﬁeld - both an inertial observer
I and a non-inertial observer N g detect the same
(Coulomb) ﬁeld; if the worldline of an electron is not
geodesic (meaning that the electron does not move
by inertia), its electric ﬁeld is deformed - both I and
N g observe the same distorted electric ﬁeld. Stated
another way, the inertial state of an electron is ab-
solute and for this reason the shape of its electric
ﬁeld is also absolute (the same for both an inertial
observer and a non-inertial observer).

CONCLUSIONS

The consequence of general relativity that the ve-
locity of light around massive bodies is anisotropic
and the classical electromagnetic mass theory reveal
that gravitation is electromagnetic in origin:

(i) Due to the anisotropic speed of light the elec-
tric ﬁeld of an electron on the Earth’s surface is dis-

torted which gives rise to an electric self-force try-
ing to force the electron to move downwards. The
self-force, being proportional to g with the coeﬃ-
cient of proportionality representing the mass that
corresponds to the energy stored in the electron’s
electric ﬁeld, is equal to what is traditionally called
a gravitational force. In such a way, the nature of
the force acting on a body on the Earth’s surface
is electromagnetic (since the body’s constituents are
all charged particles at the most fundamental level).
This means that a body’s passive gravitational mass
is electromagnetic in origin too.

(ii) An electron is falling toward the Earth with an
acceleration g in order to compensate the anisotropy
in the propagation of electromagnetic signals (with
which the diﬀerent charged elements of the elec-
tron repel one another) which ensures that its elec-
tric ﬁeld does not distort. The electron is not sub-
jected to any self-force only if its electric ﬁeld is the
Coulomb ﬁeld.
If the electron is prevented from
falling the compensation of the anisotropy of the
speed of light is not possible any more and its elec-
tric ﬁeld gets deformed which gives rise to a self-force
pulling the electron downwards. This mechanism ex-
plains why all bodies fall toward the Earth with the
same acceleration - each of their elementary charged
constituents is falling with an acceleration g in order
to prevent its electric ﬁeld from being distorted.

It is believed that the anisotropy of the speed of
light around a massive body is caused by the cur-
vature of spacetime around the body (i.e. by the
body’s gravitational ﬁeld). The spacetime curvature
itself originates from the body’s active gravitational
mass. As we have seen, however, the mass of a body
is electromagnetic in origin - this is the mass that
corresponds to the energy stored in the electric ﬁelds
of the body’s elementary charged constituents. As
there is no mass but only charges (and their ﬁelds),
it follows that the anisotropy of the speed of light
around a body is caused by the body’s charges and
their ﬁelds.
In such a way, the spacetime curva-
ture proves to be a spacetime anisotropy. And since
charges and electromagnetic ﬁelds are in principle
controllable, the anisotropy of spacetime and space-
time geometry itself are in principle controllable as
well.

The theoretical possibility to manipulate the
spacetime geometry constitutes a radically new ap-
proach to the understanding of how a body can be
propelled. There is no need for any force to be ap-
plied to a body itself in order to propel it. Instead,

the geometry of spacetime can be subjected to a
local manipulation through the application of the
sources of spacetime anisotropy - charges and elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. By changing the anisotropy of
spacetime we are in fact changing the spacetime ge-
ometry. This in turn leads to a change of the shape
of a body’s geodesic worldline and ultimately to a
change of a body’s state of motion. In other words,
a body can be propelled without being subjected to
any direct force. This paper has demonstrated that
this is possible at least in principle. How it can be
done is the subject of ongoing work.

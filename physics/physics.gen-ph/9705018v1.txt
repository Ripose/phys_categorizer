Abstract

In this note we outline the history of q-deformations; indicate their physical short-
comings; suggest their apparent resolution via an invariant formulation based on a new
mathematics of genotopic type; and point out their expected physical signiﬁcance once
formulated in an invariant form.

1 INTRODUCTION

In 1948 Albert [1] introduced the notions of Lie-admissible and Jordan-admissible algebras
as generally nonassociative algebras U with elements a, b, c, and abstract product ab which
are such that the attached algebras U − and U +, which are the same vector spaces as U
equipped with the products [a, b]U = ab − ba and {a, b}U = ab + ba, are Lie and Jordan
algebras, respectively. Albert then studied the algebra with product

(A, B) = p × A × B + (1 − p) × B × A,

(1.1)

where p is a parameter, A, B are matrices or operators (hereon assumed to be Hermitean),
and A × B is the conventional associative product.

It is easy to see that the above product is indeed jointly Lie- and Jordan-admissible
because [A, B]U = (1 − 2p) × (A × B − B × A) and {A, B}U = A × B + B × A. However,
there exist no (ﬁnite) value of p under which product (1.1) recovers the Lie product. As a
result, product (1.1) cannot be used for possible coverings of current physical theories.

In view of the above occurrence, Santilli introduced in 1967 [2] a new notion of Lie-
admissibility which is Albert’s deﬁnition [loc. cit.], plus the condition that the algebras U

1

admit Lie algebras in their classiﬁcation or, equivalently, that the generalized Lie product
admits the conventional one as a particular case.

As an illustration, we introduced the the algebra with product (Ref. [2], Eq.(8), p. 573)

and related time evolution in the inﬁnitesimal and ﬁnite forms (¯h = = 1) [3,4]

(A, B) = p × A × B − q × B × A,

(1.2)

i × dA/dt = p × A × Hq × H × A,

A(t) = {ei×q×H×t} × A(0) × {e−i×p×t×H},

(1.3)

where: p and q are non-null parameters with non-null values p ± q. It is easy to see that
product (1.2) is Lie- and Jordan-admissible and admits the Lie and Jordan products as
particular (nondegenerate) cases.

Structures (1.2) and (1.3) resulted to be insuﬃcient for physical applications because, as
we shall see in Sect. 3, the parameters p and q become operators under the time evolution of
the theory. We therefore introduced in 1978 [5] (see also monograph [6] of 1983) the notion
of general Lie-admissibility which is the notion of ref. [1] plus the conditions that algebras
U admit Lie-isotopic [5,6] (rather then Lie) algebras in their attached antisymmetric form
and admit ordinary Lie algebras in their classiﬁcation.

The latter notion was realized via the generalLie − admissibleproduct (ﬁrst introduced

in ref. [5b], p. 719; see Ref. [6] for a more detailed treatment)

and time evolution in inﬁnitesimal and ﬁnite forms (Ref. [5b], pp. 741, 742, and [6])

(A, B) = A × P × B − B × Q × A,

(1.4)

i × dA/dt = A × P × H − H × Q × A,

A(t) = {ei×H×Q×t} × A(0) × {e−i×t×P ×H},

(1.5)

where H is Hermitean but P and Q are nonsingular, generally nonhermitean matrices or
operators with non-singular values P ± Q admitting of the parametric values p and q as
particular cases. The conventional Heisenberg’s equations are evidently recovered for P =
Q = 1.

Note that the attached products [A, B]U = (A, B) − (B, A) = A × T × B − B × T × A,
T = P +Q, and {A, B}U = (A, B)+(B, A) = A×T ×B +B ×T ×A, T = P −Q, are still
Lie and (commutative) Jordan, respectively, although of a more general type called isotopic
[5,6]. Note also that the P and Q operators must be sandwiched in between the elements A
and B to characterize an algebra as commonly understood in mathematics [5,6]. It should
be ﬁnally indicated that, when properly written, Hamilton’s equations with external terms
possess precisely a Lie-admissible structure.

In 1989 Biedenharn [7] and Macfarlane [8] introduced the so-called q-deformations, with

a structure of the type

A × B − B × A → A × B − q × A × B;

(1.6)

2

which were followed by a number of papers so large to discourage an outline (see, e.g.,
representative papers [9]). More recently, other types of deformations of relativistic quantum
formulations appeared in the literature under the name of k-deformations (see, e.g., Ref.s
[10], quantum groups (see, e.g. Ref.s [11]) and others generalizations.
It is evident that
theories of type(1.6) are a particular case of the broader Lie-admissible theories (1.2) and
(1.4).

Unfortunately, even thouygh mathematically impeccable, all the above theories have re-
sulted to possess a number of physiocal shortcomings investigated in Ref.s [19,23]. As a
necessary condition to exit the class of equivalence of quantum mechanics, Lie-admissible
theories, q-deformations, k-deformations, quantum groups, and all that must have a nonuni-
tary time evolution, U × U †
6= I. When the these theories are formulated on conventional
spaces over conventional ﬁelds, the following physical shortcomings are simply unavoidable:

(1) Lack of invariance of the fundamental unit (that of the enveloping operator algebra),
because under nonunitary transforms we have I → I′ = U × I × U † = U ×
U †
6= I. This implies lack of invariance of the basi= c units of space and time,
with consequential lack of unambiguous application of the theories to experiments,
because it is not possible to conduct a meaningful measurement, say, of a length, with
a stationary meter changing in time.

(2) Lack of conservation of the Hermiticity in time, with consequential lack of physically

acceptable observables (see Sect. 3 for more details).

(3) Lack of invariance of physical laws, e.g., because of the lack of invariance of the de-

formed brackets under the time time evolution of the theory.

(4) Lack of uniqueness and invariance of numerical predictions, because of the lack of
uniqueness (e.g., in the exponentiation) and invariance (e.g., of special functions and
transforms) needed for data elaboration (for instance, the ”q-parameter” becomes a ”Q-
operator” under a nonunitary transform, Q = q × U × U †, with consequential evident
loss of all original special functions and transforms constructed for the q-parameter).

(5) Loss of the axioms of the special relativity, an occurrence of all generalizations under
consideration, evidently because deformed spaces and symmetries are no longer iso-
morphic to the original ones. This creates the sizable problems of: ﬁrst, identifying
new axioms capable of replacing Einstein’s axioms; second, proving their axiomatic
consistency; and, third, establishing them experimentally.

In this note we shall present a conceivable resolution of the above physical shortcomings
based on the use of a new mathematics called genomathematics, as recently identiﬁed in
memoir [12]. To render the note self-suﬃcient, we shall ﬁrst outline in Sect. 2 the rudiments
of the genomathematics and then indicate in Sect. 3 the invariant formulation of (p, q)- and
(P, Q)-deformations.

The reader should keep in mind that the most serious shortcoming of generalized theories
under consideration in this note is the loss of Einstein’s axioms. Our primary objective is
therefore to attempt the formulation of generalized theories in such a way to preserve the
axioms of the special relativity, although in generalized spaces and ﬁelds. If achieved, this
result will be suﬃcient, alone, to resolve all possible physical shortcomings.

2 GENOMATHEMATICS

The main idea of the Lie-admissible theory [6] is that its structure (1.5) is inherent in the
conventional Lie theory. In fact, a one-parameter connected Lie group realized via Hermitean
operators X = X † on a Hilbert space H has in reality the structure of a bi-module (also
called in nonassociative algebras spit-null extension,see, e.g., Ref. [13]).

In nontechnical terms, the structure of a Lie group as a bimodule is essentially character-
ized by an action from the left U > and an action from the right <U with explicit realization
and interconnecting conjugation

A(t) = U > × Q(0) ×< U = {ei×X>×w

} > A(0) < {e−i×w×<X} =
= (I > + i × X > × w + ...) > A(0) < (<I − i × w ×< X + ...),

U > = (<U)† = U >, X > = (<X)† = X,

ˆI > = <I = I,

(2.1)

(where w is a Lie parameter and the multiplications > and < represent conventional asso-
ciative products ordered to the right and to the left, respectively). The inﬁnitesimal version
in the neighborhood of the unit then acquires the familiar form

i[A(dw) − A(0))/dw = A < X − X > A = A × X − X × A,

(2.2)

which clariﬁes that in the product AxX = A < X(X × A = X > A), X in actuality acts
from the right (from the left).

The bimodular structure is generally ignored in the conventional formulation of Lie’s
theory because un-necessary. In fact, in a Lie bimodule {<H, H>}, where <H = H> =
H is a conventional Hilbert space, the modular action to the right and to the left are
interconnected with the simple bimodular rules [14] X × > ψ> = X × ψ = −<ψ <<
X = −ψ × X, where ψ> ∈ H>, <ψ ∈< H, X > is an element of the universal enveloping
associative algebra ξ>(L) of the considered Lie algebra L ≈ [ξ>(L)]− for the action to the
right and <X ∈< ξ(L) [14]. Since H> = <H = H, and ξ>(L) = <ξ(L) = ξ(L).
The bireprsentations of the bimodular structure {<ξ(L), ξ>(L)} over {<H, H>} can then be
eﬀectively reduced to the one-sided representations, or just representations for short, of ξ(L)
over H, as well known. However, as we shall see shortly, the original bimodular structure of
Lie’s theory is no longer trivial for broader realizations of axioms (2.1).

Lie-admissible structure (1.5) was proposed [5b] on the basis of the mere observation
that the abstract axioms of the bimodular structure (2.1) do not necessarily require that
the multiplications > and < must be conventional, because they can also be generalized,
provided that they remain associative. In other word, the abstract axiomatic structure of
the action from the right, U > > A(0) is that of a right modular associative action, with no
restriction on the realization of the associative product, and the same occurs for the action
from the left A(0) << U.

The simplest possible broadening of the Lie version is given by the isotopies of Lie’s
theory, ﬁrst proposed in Ref.s [5], then studied in various works (see Ref. [6] for a compre-
hensive presentation as of 1983), and it is called the Lie-Santilli isotheory (see, e.g., Refs.
[15-18]). It is essentially characterized by the lifting of the conventional right modular as-
sociative product U > > A(0) = U > × T × A(a) with conjugate from the left A(0) << U,

4

where T = T † is a ﬁxed, well behaved, nowhere singular and Hermitean matrix or operator
of the same dimension of the considered representation . Its inverse ˆI = T −1 is then a fully
acceptable, generalized, left and right unit, I × A = A > ˆI = ˆI < A = A < ˆI = ˆI for
all possible elements A.

The isotopies then require, for mathematical and physical consistency, the reconstruction
of the entire Lie theory with respect to the new unit ˆI and isoproduct > = < = ˆ×, including:
numbers and ﬁelds; vector, metric and Hilbert spaces; Lie algebras, groups and symmetries;
[15-18]. This intermediate level of study
transformation and representation theories; etc.
also possesses a trivial bimodular structure, in the sense that its two-sided representations
can be eﬀectively reduced to the one-sided form.

Following the prior achievement of suﬃcient mathematical maturity in Ref.

[12], the
physical proﬁles of the isotopic realization of axioms (2.1) have been studied in details in the
recent memoir [19], including most importantly the resolution of problematic aspects (1)-(5)
of the preceding section. A knowledge of Ref. [19] is useful for a technical understanding of
this note.

Our objective is the realization of the abstract axioms of bimodular structure (2.1) via
the generalized associative laws originally submitted in Ref. [5b] of 1978, under the name of
genoassociative multiplication and unit (or genomultiplication and genounit for short), then
studies in Ref.s [6,20], and more recently studied in details in Ref. [12],

A > B = A × P × B, A < B = A × Q × B,

ˆI > = P −1, I > > A = A > ˆI > = A, <I = = Q−1, <I < A = A << I = A,
ˆI > = P −1 = (< ˆI)† = Q†,

(2.3)

where P 6= Q are well behaved, everywhere invertible, nonhermitean matrices or opera-
tors generally realized via real-valued nonsymmetric matrices of the same dimension of the
considered Lie representation. Moreover, it is requested that that P + Q and P − Q are
nonsingular to preserve a well deﬁned Lie and Jordan content, respectively. To diﬀerentiate
forms (2.3) from the isotopic ones, I called them genotopic in Ref. [5], to denote their char-
acter of inducing a more general realization. I > and <I and then called genotopic units and
P and Q the genotopic elements.

Broader products and units (2.3) characterize the following more general realization of
the abstract axioms (2.1) I tentatively called Lie-admissible transformation group [5,6,12,20]

A(t) = U > > A(0) << A = {ei×X×w

} > A(0) < {< e−i×w×X} =

>

= {ei×X×P ×w} × A(0) × {e−i×w×Q×X} =
= (I + i × X × P × w + ...) × A(0) < (<I − i × w ×< Q ×< X + ...),
= (I > + i × X × w + ...) > A(0) < (<I − i × w ×< X + ...),

U > = (<U)†, X > = (<X)† = <X = X, P > = P = (<Q)† = Q†,
ˆI > = P −1 = (<I)† = (Q†)−1,

(2.4)

with inﬁnitesimal version in the neighborhood of the genounits characterized by the general
Lie-admissible algebra [loc. cit.]

5

i × [A(dw) − A(0))/dw = A < X − X > A = A × P × X − X × Q × A,

(2.5)

where we have used the genoexponentiation to the right and to the left [12,18]

ei×X×w
>

= I > +i × X × w/1! + (i × X × w) > (i × X × w)/2! + ... = {ei×X×P ×w} × I >,

<ei×w×X = <I +i×X ×w/1!+(i×X ×w) > (i×X ×w)/2!+... = <I ×{ei×w×Q×X}, (2.6)

It is at this point where the essential bimodular character of axioms (2.1) acquire their full
light because no longer eﬀectively reducible to a one-sided form. It is evident that realization
(2.4) and (2.5) of the conventional Lie axioms (2.1) coincides with the Lie-admissible equa-
tions (1.5) and (1.4). For this reason, realizations (2.3)-(2.6) are assumed as the foundation
of the Lie-admissible theory under study in this section.

The central assumption we are studying herein is the bimodular lifting of the unit of
Lie’s theory I → {<, ˆI, ˆI >},< ˆI = ( ˆI >)†. To achieve consistency, the entirety of the Lie
theory must be lifted into a dual genotopic form, with no known exception. A rudimentary
review of the emerging genotopic mathematics or genomathematics for short of Ref. [12] plus
unpublished aspects is the following.

DEFINITION 1 [21]: Let F = F (a, +, ×) be a conventional ﬁeld of (reaL R, complex
C or quaternionic Q) numbers a with additive unit 0, multiplicative unit I = 1, sum
a + b and product a × b. The genoﬁelds to the right F > = F >(a>, +>, ×>) are rings
with elements a> = a × I > called genonumbers, where a is an element of F , × is the
multiplication in F , and I > = P −1 is a well behaved, everywhere invertible and non-
Hermitean quantity generally outside F , equipped with all operations ordered to the right,
i.e., the ordered genosum to the right, ordered genoproduct to the right, etc.,

(a>) +> (b>) = (a + b) × I >, (a>) ×> (b>) = (a>) > (b>)(a>) × P × (b>) = (a × b) × I >,
(2.7)
genoadditive unit to the right 0> = 0 and genounit to the right I >. The genoﬁelds to
the left <F = <F (<a,< +,< ×) are rings with genonumbers <a = <I × a, all operations
ordered to the left, such as genosum (<a)< + (<b) = <b) = <I × (a + b), genoproduct
(<a) < (<b) = (<a) × Q × (<b) = <I × (a × b), etc., with additive genounit to the left
<0 = 0 and multiplicative genounit to the left <I = Q−1 which is generally diﬀerent than
than the genounit I > to the right. A bigenoﬁeld is the structure {<F, F >} with corresponding
bielements, biunits, bioperations, etc. holding jointly to the left and right under the condition
ˆI > = (<I)†.

LEMMA 1 [21]: Each individual genoﬁeld to the right F > or to the left <F is a ﬁeld
isomorphic to the original ﬁeld F . Thus, the liftings F → F >, F → <F and {F, F } →
{<F, F >} are axiom-preserving.

REMARKS: In the deﬁnition of ﬁelds (and isoﬁelds [21]) there is no ordering of the
multiplication in the sense that in the products a × b and a ˆ×b = a × T × b, T = T †, one

6

can either select a multiplying b from the left, a < b or b multiplying a from the right a > b,
because a > b = a < b (even for non-commutative isoﬁelds such as the isoquaternions).
A genoﬁeld requires that all multiplications and related operations (division, moduli, etc.)
be ordered either to the right or to the left because now, for a commutative ﬁeld F = R
or C, we have the properties a > b = b > a and a < b = b < a, but in general
a > b = a × P × b 6= a < b = a × Q × b. Note that in each case the genounit is the left and
right unit, Eq.s (2.3). The important advances of Ref. [21] are therefore the identiﬁcation,
ﬁrst, that the axioms of a ﬁeld remain valid when the multiplication is ordered to the right
or to the left, and, second, each ordered multiplication can be generalized, provided that
it remains associative. The above mathematical occurrences permit the axiomatization of
irreversibility beginning with the most fundamental quantities, units and numbers. In fact,
the unit and product to the right, I > and >, characterize motion forward in time while the
conjugate quantities <I and < characterize motion backward in time. Irreversibility is then
ensured under the condition I > 6= <I because all subsequent mathematical structures,
being always built on numbers, must preserve the same axiomatization of irreversibility, as
a necessary condition for consistency.

DEFINITION 2 [12]: Let S = S(r, g, R) be a conventional n-dimensional metric or
pseudo-metric space with local chart r = {rk}, k = 1, 2, ..., n, nowhere singular, real-
valued and symmetric metric g = g(r, ...) and invariant r2 = rt × g × r (where t denotes
transposed) over a conventional real ﬁeld R = R(a, +, ×). The n-dimensional genospaces
to the right S> = S>(r>, G>, R>) are vector spaces with local genocoordinates to the right
r> = r × I >, genometric G> = P × g × I > = (g>) × I >, g> = P × g, and genoinvariant
to the right

(r>)2> = (r>)t > (G>) > r> = [rt × (g>) × r] × I > ∈ R>,

(2.8)

which, for consistency, must be a genoscalar to the right with structure n × I > and be
an element of the genoﬁeld R> with common genounit to the right I > = P −1 where
P is given by an everywhere invertible, real-valued, non-symmetric nxn matrix. The n-
dimensional genospaces to the left <S = <S(<r,< +,< F ) are genospaces over genoﬁelds with
all operations ordered to the left and a common nxn-dimensional genounit to the left <I =
Q−1 which is generally diﬀerent than that to the right but verifying the interconnecting
condition P = Q†. The bigenospaces are the structures {<S, S>} with bigenocoordiantes,
etc, deﬁned over the bigenoﬁeld {<R, R>} under the condition I > = (<I)†.

LEMMA 2 [12]: Genospaces to the right S> and, independently, those to the left <S

(thus bigenospaces {<S, S>}) are locally isomorphic to the original spaces S ( {S, S} ).

PROOF. The original metric g is lifted in the form g → P × g, but the unit is lifted
by the inverse amount I → I > = P −1 thus preserving the original axioms (because the
invariant is (length)2 × (unit)2), and the same occurs for the other cases. q.e.d.

REMARKS. The best way to see the local isomorphism between conventional and geno-
spaces is by nothing that the latter are the results of the following novel degree of freedom
of the former (here expressed for the case of a scalar complex function P )

7

rt × g × r × I ≡ rt × g × r × Q × Q−1 ≡ (rt × g> × r) × I > ≡

≡ P −1 × P × (rt × g × r × I) ≡< I × (r ×< g × rt)

(2.9)

which is another illustration of the structure of the basic invariant of metric spaces [length]2×
[Unit]2.

DEFINITION 3 [12]: The genodiﬀerential calculus to the right on a genospace S >
(r>, R>) over R> is the image of the conventional diﬀerential calculus characterized by the
expressions (where we have ignored for notational simplicity the multiplication to the right
by I >)

drk → d>rk = (I >)k

i × dri, drk → d>rk = P i

k × dri,

∂/∂rk → ∂>/∂>rk = P i

k × ∂/∂ri, ∂/∂rk → ∂>/∂>rk = I k

i × I/∂ri,

(2.10)

with all operations ordered to the right and main properties

∂>ri/∂>rj = δij, ∂>ri/∂>rj = δj

i , etc.

(2.11)

The genodiﬀerential calculus to the left is the conjugate of the preceding one for the genounit
to the left <I 6= I >. The bigenodiﬀerential calculus is that acting on {<S, S>} over {<R, R>}
for I > = (<I)†.

LEMMA 3 [12]: The genocalculus to the right and, independently, that to the left preserve

all original properties, such as commutativity of the second-order derivative, etc.

REMARKS. A important advance of Ref.

[12] is the identiﬁcation of an insidious lack
of invariance where one would expect it the least, in the conventional diﬀerential calculus,
because traditionally formulated without indicating its dependence on the selected unit. As
a result, all generalized equations of motion expressed in terms of conventional derivative,
e.g., dA/dt, are not invariant.

DEFINITION 4 [12]: The genogeometries to the right, or to the left, or the bigenogeome-
tries are the geometries of the corresponding genospaces when entirely expressed via the
applicable geonomathematics, including the genodiﬀerential calculus.

LEMMA 4 [loc. cit.]: The genoeuclidean, genominkowskian, genoriemannian and geno-
symplectic geometries to the right and, independently, to the left and their combined bimod-
ular form, are locally isomorphic to the original geometries (i.e., the verify their abstract
axioms).

REMARKS. Another intriguing property identiﬁed in memoir [12] is that the Riemannian
axioms do not necessarily need symmetric metrics because the metrics can also be nonsym-
metric with structure g> = P × g, P = P t real-valued but nonsymmetric, provided
that the geometry is formulated on a genoﬁeld with genounit given by the inverse of the

8

nonsymmetric part, I > = P −1, and the same occurs for the case to the left. This property
has permitted the ﬁrst quantitative studies on the irreversibility of interior gravitational
problems via the conventional Riemannian axioms [20], e.g., the geometrization of the irre-
versible black hole model by Ellis, Nonopoulos and Mavromatos [21],which has precisely a
Lie-admissible structure, and other models. These remarks are important to begin to see the
physical relevance of Biedenharn’s q-deformations when written in an axiomatically correct
form.

DEFINITION 5 [12]: Let H be a conventional Hilbert space with states |ψ >, |ϕ >,
..., inner product < ϕ| × |ψ > over the ﬁeld C = C(c, +, ×) of complex numbers and
normalization < ψ| × |ψ > = 1. A genohilbert space to the right H> is a right genolinear
space with genostates |ψ> >, |ϕ> >, ..., genoinner product and genonormalization to the
right

< ϕ>| > |ψ> > = < ψ>| × P × |ψ> > ×I > ∈ C >(c>+>, ×>), < ϕ>| > |ψ> > = I >

(2.12)
deﬁned over a genocomplex ﬁeld to the right C >(c>, +>, ×>) with a common genounit
I > = P −1. A genohilbert space to the left <H is the left conjugate of H> with left genounit
<I = Q−1 generally diﬀerent than I >. A bigenohilbert space is the bistructure [<H, H>}
over the bigenoﬁeld {<C, C >} under the conjugation I > = (<I)†.

LEMMA 5: The right-, left- and bi-genohilbert spaces are locally isomorphic to the

original space H.

PROOF. The original inner product is lifted by the amount < | × | > → < | × P × | >,
but the underlying unit is lifted by the inverse amount, 1 → P −1, thus leaving the original
axiomatic structure unchanged. q.e.d.

REMARK. The understanding of genooperator theory requires the knowledge that it is
a consequence of the following, hitherto unknown degree of freedom of conventional Hilbert
spaces (where P is independent from the integration variable for simplicity)

< ϕ| × |ψ > ≡ < ψ| × |ψ > ×P × P −1 ≡< ϕ| × P × |ψ > ×P −1 = < ϕ| < |ψ > ×<I ≡
(2.13)

≡ < ϕ| × |ψ > ×Q × Q−1 ≡< ϕ| > |ψ > ×I >,

which sis evidently the Hilbert space counterpart of the novel invariance (2.9). It should be
noted that new invariances (2.9) and (2.13) have remained undetected since Riemannian’s
and Hilbert’s times, respectively, because they required the prior discovery of new numbers,
those with an arbitrary, generally nonhermitean unit.

DEFINITION 6: Genolinear operators to the right are operators A, B, ..., of a genoen-
veloping algebra to the right verifying the condition of genolinearity (i.e., linearity on H> over
C >), and a similar occurrence holds for the left case. In particular, we have the genounitary
operators to the right and to the left

9

U > > U >† = U >† > U = I >, <U << U † = <U † << U = <I.

(2.14)

When applied on the bistructure {<H, H>} over {<C, C >}, the theory is bigenolinear.

LEMMA 6: Operators X which are originally Hermitean on H over C remains Hermitean

on H> over C >, or on <H over <C (i.e., genotopies preserve the original observables).

PROOF. The condition of genohermiticity on H> reads X †> = Q × Q−1 × X † ×Q ×

Q−1 = X†. q.e.d.

LEMMA 7: Under suﬃcient topological conditions, any conventionally nonunitary oper-

ator on H can be identically written in a genounitary form to the right or to the left.

PROOF. Any operator U of the considered class such that U × U †

written

and properties (2.14) follows. q.e.d.

REMARKS. The reader should be aware that the entire theory of linear operators on
a Hilbert spaces must be lifted into a genotopic form for consistency. For instance, con-
ventional operations, such as TrX, DetX, etc. can be easily proved to be inapplicable for
genomathematics, and must be replaced with the corresponding genoforms. The same hap-
pens for all conventional and special functions and transforms. A systematic study of the
theory of genolinear operators will be conducted elsewhere.

We are now equipped to present, apparently for the ﬁrst time, the central notion of this
note which consists of the old notion of Lie-admissibility upgraded with the systematic use
of genomathematics.

DEFINITION 7: Consider the conventional Lie theory with ordered N-dimensional basis
of Hermitean operators X = {Xk}, parameters w = {wk}, universal enveloping associative
algebra ξ = ξ(L), Lie algebra L ≈ [ξ(L)]−, corresponding, (connected) Lie transformation
group G on a space S(r, F ) with local coordinates r = {rk} over a ﬁeld F .

The Lie-admissible theory (also called Lie-Santilli genotheory [15-18]) is here deﬁned as
a step-by-step bimodular lifting of the conventional Lie theory deﬁned on bigenospaces over
bigenoﬁelds, and includes:

(5.A) The universal genoenveloping associative algebra to the right ξ>(L) of an N-dimen-
sional Lie algebra L with ordered basis X > ≡ X = {Xk}, k = 1, 2, ..., N, genounit
I > = Q−1, genoassociative product Xi > Xj = Xi × Q × Xj and inﬁnite-dimensional
genobasis characterized by the genotopic Poincare’-Birkhoﬀ-Witt theorem to the right

I > = Q−1, Xk, Xi > Xj (i ≤ j), Xi > Xj > Xk(i ≤ j ≤ k), ...
and genoexponentiation (2.16); the universal genoassociative algebra to the left <ξ(L) with
genounit <I = P −1 and genoproduct Xi < Xj = Xi × P × Xj, with inﬁnite-dimensional
genobasis characterized by the genotopic Poincare’-Birkhoﬀ-Witt theorem to the left

(2.16)

10

<I = P −1, Xk, Xi < Xj (i ≤ j), Xi < Xj < Xk (i ≤ j ≤ k), ...
and genoexponentiation to the left (2.6); the bigenoenvelope is the bistructure {<ξ, ξ>} de-
ﬁned on corresponding bigenospaces and bigenoﬁelds under the condition I > = (<I)†.

(2.17)

(5a) A Lie-Santilli genoalgebra is a bigenolinear bigenoalgebra deﬁned on {<ξ, ξ>} over

{<F, F >} with Lie-admissible product

(Xi, Xj) = Xi < Xj − Xj > Xi = Xi × P × Xj − Xj × Q × Xi.

(2.18)

(5c) A (connected) Lie-Santilli genotransformation group is the biset {<G, G>} of bigeno-

transforms on {<S, S>} over {<F, F >} with genounits <I = (I >)†

r>′ = (U >) > r> = (U >) × Q > r × I > = V × r × I >, U > = V × I >,
<r′ = <r < (<U) = <I × r × P × (<U) = <I × r × W, <U <I × W,

(2.19)

verifying the following conditions: genodiﬀerentiability of the maps G> > S> → S> and
<S ← S << G, invariance of the genounits and genolinearity, with realizations U > =
exp>(i × w × X) and <U = exp<(−i × w × X), genolaws

U >(w.> > U >(w>′) = U >(w> + w>′), U >(w>) > U >(−w>) = U >(0>) = I >.

(2.20)

and Lie-admissible algebra in the neighborhood of the genounits {<I, I >} according to rule
(2.4).

LEMMA 8: Lie-admissible product (2.18) veriﬁes the Lie axioms when deﬁned on {<ξ, ξ>}

over {<F, F >}.

PROOF. The genoenvelopes to the left <ξ and to the right ξ> are isomorphic to the
original envelope ξ, thus implying <I(A < B) = (AS > B)I> i.e., the value of the
genoproduct A < B = A × P × B, when measured with respect to the genounit <I = P −1,
is equal to that of the genoproduct A > B = A × Q × B measured with respect to the
genounit I > = Q−1. q.e.d.

The most important property of this section, which is an evident consequence of the

preceding analysis, can be expressed as follows:

THEOREM: Lie-admissible groups as per Deﬁnition 7 coincide at the abstract level with

the original Lie-transformation groups.

REMARKS. Note that the generators of the original Lie algebra are not lifted under
genotopies, evidently because they represent conventional physical quantities, such as energy,
linear momentum, angular momentum, etc. Only the operations deﬁned on them are lifted.
Note also that, when conjugation P = Q† is violated, the Lie axioms are lost. Note also that
the genotheory is highly nonlinear, because the elements P and Q in genotransforms (2.19)
have un unrestricted functional dependence, this including that in the local coordinates.
Nevertheless, genomathematics reconstructs linearity in genospaces over genoﬁelds. The

11

same happens for nonlocality, noncanonicity, nonunitarity and irreversibility [20]. In fact,
on genospaces over genoﬁelds, genotheories are fully linear, local, canonical unitary and
reversible. Departures from these axiomatic properties occur only in their projection over
conventional; spaces and ﬁelds. These are evident fundamental conditions to lift nonlinear,
nonlocal, noncanonical, nonunitary and irreversible theories into a form compatible with the
notoriously linear, local, canonical, unitary and reversible axioms of the special relativity.

Needless to say, we have been able to present in this note only the rudiments of the needed
genomathematics, with the understanding that its detailed study is rather vast indeed. Also,
by no means, genomathematics should be considered as the most general possible form
admitted by the Lie axioms. Mathematics and physics are disciplines which will never admit
”ﬁnal theories”.
In fact, a still broader multivalued hyperrealization of Lie’s theory has
already been identiﬁed in Ref. [12] and cannot be treated here for brevity.

3 INVARIANT FORMULATION OF q - DEFORMA-

TIONS

We are now equipped to submit the suggested invariant formulation of the (p, q)- [2] or
q-deformations [2,7,8]. First, we have to identify the following insuﬃciencies:

(I) No invariant formulation is possible for (p, q)-parameters because, under the nonuni-
tary time evolution of the theory, brackets (1.2) or (??) assume the general Lie-
admissible form (1.4) (for which reason the latter was submitted in the ﬁrst place
[5b,6]),

U ×(A, B)×U † = p×U ×A×B ×U † −q×U ×B ×A×U † = A′×P ×B′−B′×Q×A′,

P = p×(U ×U †)−1, Q = q×(U ×u†)−1, A′ = U ×A×U †. B′ = U ×B×U †. (3.1)

(II) Despite such a generality, the formulation are still not physically acceptable because
they generally violate the crucial conjugation P = Q†, without which there is the loss
of the Lie axioms (Sect. 2) with consequential problems in invariance, causality, etc.
The condition P = Q† is therefore assumed hereon.

(III) Brackets (A, B) = A × P × B − B × Q × A, P = Q† on conventional spaces and
ﬁelds are still not invariant and, therefore, they have all problematic aspects (1)-(5)
of the (p, q)- and q-deformations (Sect. 1). In fact, under an additional (necessarily)
nonunitary transform we have

U × (A, B) × U † = U × A × P × B × U † − U × B × A × U † = A′ × P ′ × B′ − B′ × Q′ × A′,

P ′ = U †−1 ×P ×U −1, Q′ = U †−1 ×Q×U −1, A′ = U ×A×U † B′ = U ×B ×U †. (3.2)
This implies the lack of invariance of the fundamental genounits I > = P −1 and <I = Q−1,
with consequential ambiguous physical applications.

12

The only possible resolution of the above problematic aspects known to this author is the
formulation of the q-parameter deformations in the operator (P, Q)-deformations formulated
via the genomathematics of Sect. 2, i.e., on bigenoﬁeld, bigenospaces, bigenoalgebra, etc.

In fact, it is easy to see that each structure to the right is invariant under the action of
the genogroup to the right, e.g., U > > I > > U >† = I >, U >(A > B) > U >† = A′ > B, the
initial genohermiticity to the right can be proved to remain invariant under the action of a
genogroup to the right, etc.

¿From these grounds, genominkowskian spaces, the genopoincare’ symmetry and the
genospecial relativity are expected to coincide at abstract level with the conventional corre-
sponding structures, with the understanding that the detailed study of this expectation will
be predictably long and cannot possibly be done in this note.

We close with a simple rule for the explicit construction of invariant (P, Q)-deformations
and related genomathematics. It is based on the systematic use of two nonunitary transforms
for the characterization of motion forward and backward in time,

A × A† 6= I, B × B† 6= I, A × B† = I > = Q−1, B × A† = <I = (I >)†.

(3.3)

It is then easy to see that the entire genomathematics of the preceding section follows
via a simple application of the above two transforms. For instance, the genonumbers to
the right are given by the above transforms of conventional numbers A× > a × B† =
a × (A × B†) = A × I >, the genoproduct to the right is given by the same transform
A × (A × B) × B† = A′ × Q × B′, Q = (A × B†)−1 with the correct Hermiticity properties,
etc.

Most importantly, the Lie-Santilli genogroups and genoalgebras can also be derived via
the above dual nonunitary map. In fact, a conventional, right modular Lie group is lifted
under the transform A × B† into the forward genoform

ei×X×w → A × {ei×X×w} × B† =

= A × (I + i × X × w/1! + (i × X × w) × (i × X × w)/2! + ...) × B† =
= I > +> i> > X > > w>/>1!> +

+>(i> > X > > w>) > (i> > X > > w>) > (i> > X > > w>/>2!> +> ...) =

= (I + i × X > × Q × w)/1! +

+(i × X > × Q × w) × (i × X > × Q × w)/2! + ...) × I > =

= {ei×X>×w} × I > ≡ e>i × X × w,

I > = A × B† = Q−1,
X > = A × X × B†, w> = w × I >,

i> > X > > w> ≡ i × X > × w,

(3.4)

with a conjugate lifting for the left modular action. Lie-admissible algebras then follows

in the neighborhood of the genounits {<I, I >}.

In conclusion, Biedenharn’s 1989 paper on q-deformations [7], when expressed in an in-
variant, (P, Q)-operator, Lie-admissible form, deals with one of the most important problems
of the physics of this century, the origin of irreversibility. In fact, the invariant formulation

13

of the deformations permits the identiﬁcation of the origin of irreversibility at the ultimate
level of physical reality, such as a proton in the core of a collapsing star [22]. In this case
all conventional, action-at-a-distance, potential forces are represented via the conventional
Hamiltonian H, while contact, zero-range, nonhamiltonian, irreversible eﬀects are represented
via the forward isounit I > = A × B† with diﬀerent backward from <I = (<I) = B × A†.
When applicable in interior problems, the emerging theory is then structurally irreversible,
that is, irreversible even for reversible Hamiltonians.

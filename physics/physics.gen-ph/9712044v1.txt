DETERMINATION OF THE FINE
STRUCTURE CONSTANT BY π

Abstract

In the present report the author presents a simple and systemat-
ically deﬁned formula for the ﬁne structure constant based only on
the number π. The diﬀerence between the suggested value and the
currently known experimental one is about 60 times smaller than the
uncertainty interval.

The fundamental physical constants have attracted the attention of physi-
cists and mathematicians for long time. Especially challenging is the idea
that they can be reduced to mathematical constants (Hilbert [1], Einstein
[2]).

The greatest is the challenge oﬀered by the dimensionless constant α of
Sommerfeld [3], currently known as the ﬁne structure constant or as electro-
magnetic constant. As it is well known, it is determined by the dimensionless
relation e2/¯hc , where e is the elementary electric charge, ¯h is Plank’s con-
stant divided by 2π, and c - the absolute velocity (the speed of light). Its
reciprocal value 1/α is very closed to the integer 137 and this fact has grown
the attention of many researches starting with Sommerfeld himself. Edding-
ton’s special interest towards this issue is well known, too [4]. Similarly
Dirac assumed that some constants, including the ﬁne structure constant α ,

where build up of simple quantities like 4π [5]. In this line of research were
published interesting formulae such as:

(245!/π5)1/4(8π4/9) = 137, 036 082
108π(8/1843)1/6 = 137, 035 915
4π5/9 + 37/36 = 137, 036 527
(1372 + π2)1/2 = 137, 036 016

considered in more details in [6].

The currently recommended by The National Institute of Standards and
Technology (USA) value of Sommerfeld’s constant and its reciprocal are [7]:

αR = 7, 297 353 08(33) × 10
α−1
R = 137, 035 989 5(61) .

In this note, following Dirac’s idea I will show that α could be presented with
an absolute (for the moment) accuracy in a simple and systematical way
only through the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and π. In order to do that I will
introduce the quantities:

Proposition: the number

has the value

and its reciprocal value is

αρ := α0/ (1 + L − 2S + 3 V /2)

αρ = 7, 297 353 085 4... × 10−3

α−1
ρ = 137, 035 989 392... .

The comparison shows that the number (3) not only is in the limits of
the error of the experimental value (1) but hits its central value. The same
is valid, of course, for the reciprocal values (4) and (2).

It comes to prove that Sommerfeld’s constant can in fact be presented

through simple mathematical quantities, based on the number π.

On ¯Aryabhat.a’s Planetary Constants
Subhash Kak∗

February 2, 2008

Abstract

This paper examines the theory of a Babylonian origin of ¯Aryabhat.a’s
planetary constants. It shows that ¯Aryabhat.a’s basic constant is closer
to the Indian counterpart than to the Babylonian one. Sketching
connections between ¯Aryabhat.a’s framework and earlier Indic astro-
nomical ideas on yugas and cyclic calendar systems, it is argued that
¯Aryabhat.a’s system is an outgrowth of an earlier Indic tradition.

Keywords: ¯Aryabhat.a’s astronomy, Kaliyuga, Mah¯ayuga, synodic

lunar months

Introduction

An old problem in the history of Indian science is whether ideas at the ba-
sis of ¯Aryabhat.a’s astronomy were borrowed from outside or were part of
India’s own tradition. This problem was ﬁrst raised in the context of the
now discredited thesis that sound observational astronomy did not exist in
India prior to India’s encounter with the West. Thus in a recent paper,1 Ab-
hyankar argues that “ ¯Aryabhat.a’s values of bhagan. as were probably derived
from the Babylonian planetary data.” But Abhyankar makes contradictory
assertions in the paper, suggesting at one place that ¯Aryabhat.a had his own
observations and at another place that he copied numbers without under-
standing, making a huge mistake in the process.

In support of his theory, Abhyankar claims that ¯Aryabhat.a used the
Babylonian value of 44528 synodic months in 3600 years as his starting point.
But this value is already a part of the ´Satapatha altar astronomy reconciling
lunar and solar years in a 95-year yuga. In this ritual, an altar is built to an

area that is taken to represent the naks.atra or the lunar year in tithis and
the next design is the same shape but to a larger area (solar year in tithis),
but since this second design is too large, the altar construction continues in
a sequence of 95 years. It appears that satisfactory reconciliation by adding
intercalary months to the lunar year of 360 tithis amounted to subtracting
a certain number of tithis from the 372 tithis of the solar year, whose most
likely value was 89 tithis in 95 years.2

The areas of the altars increase from 7 1

2 in the 95 long sequence
in increments of one. The average size of the altar is therefore 54 1
2 , implying
that the average diﬀerence between the lunar and the solar year is taken to
be one unit with 54 1
2 which is about 6.60 tithis for the lunar year of 360
tithis. This is approximately correct.

2 to 101 1

Considering a correction of 89 tithis in 95 years, the corrected length of
the year is 372 − 89/95 = 371.06316 tithis. Since each lunation occurs in 30
tithis, the number of lunations in 3600 years is 44527.579. In a Mah¯ayuga,
this amounts to 53,433,095. In fact, the number chosen by ¯Aryabhat.a (row
1 in Table 1) is closer to this number rather than the Babylonian number of
53,433,600.

Table 1 presents the Babylonian numbers given by Abhyankar together
with the ¯Aryabhat.a constants related to the synodic lunar months and the
revolutions of the lunar node, the lunar apogee, and that of the planets.
The so-called Babylonian numbers are not actually from any Babylonian
text but were computed by Abhyankar using the rule of three on various
Babylonian constants.

We see that no numbers match. How does one then make the case that
¯Aryabhat.a obtained his numbers from a Babylonian text? Abhyankar says

2

that these numbers are diﬀerent because of his ( ¯Aryabhat.a’s) own obser-
vations “which are more accurate.” But if ¯Aryabhat.a had his own obser-
vations, why did he have to “copy” Babylonian constants, and end up not
using them, anyway?

Certain numbers have great discrepancy, such as those of the lunar
apogee, which Abhyankar suggests was due to a “wrong reading of 6 by 8”
implying–in opposition to his earlier view in the same paper that ¯Aryabhat.a
also had his own observations– that ¯Aryabhat.a did not possess his own data
and that he simply copied numbers from some manual brought from Baby-
lon!

The ¯Aryabhat.a numbers are also more accurate that Western numbers
as in the work of Ptolemy.3 Given all this, there is no credible case to accept
the theory of borrowing of these numbers from Babylon.

Abhyankar further suggests that ¯Aryabhat.a may have borrowed from
(i) the concept of the
Babylon the two central features of his system:
Mah¯ayuga, and (ii) mean superconjunction of all planets at some remote
epoch in time. In fact, Abhyankar repeats here an old theory of Pingree4
and van der Waerden5 about a transmission from Babylon of these two cen-
tral ideas. In this paper, we show that these ideas were already present in
the pre-Siddh¯antic astronomy and, therefore, a contrived connection with
Babylonian tables is unnecessary.

2 The Indic tradition of yugas and superconjunc-

tions

In the altar ritual of the Br¯ahman. as,6 equivalences by number connected
the altar area to the length of the year. The 5-year yuga is described in
the Ved¯a ˙nga Jyotis.a, where only the motions of the sun and the moon
are considered. The ´Satapatha Br¯ahman. a describes the 95-year cycle to
harmonize the solar and the lunar years. The ´Satapatha Br¯ahman. a also
describes an asymmetric circuit for the sun7, which the Greeks speak about
only around 400 BC.

Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd mention of the nominal year of 372 tithis, the naks.atra
year of 324 tithis, and a solar year of 371 tithis. The fact that a further cor-
rection was required in 95 years indicates that these ﬁgures were in them-
selves considered to be approximate.

In the altar ritual, the primal person is made to an area of 7 1

2 purus.as,
when a purus.a is also equated with 360 years leading to another cycle of

3

2700 years. This is the Saptars.i cycle which was taken to start and end with
a superconjunction.

The ´Satapatha Br¯ahman. a 10.4.2.23-24 describes that the R. gveda has
432,000 syllables, the Yajurveda has 288,000 and the S¯amaveda has 144,000
syllables. This indicates that larger yugas in proportion of 3:2:1 were known
at the time of the conceptualization of the Sam. hit¯as.

Since the nominal size of the R. gveda was considered to be 432,000 syl-
lables (SB 10.4.2.23) we are led to the theory of a much larger yuga of that
extent in years since the R. gveda represented the universe symbolically.

Elsewhere, I show8 how the Ved¯a ˙nga Jyotis.a serves as a coordinate sys-
tem for the sun and the moon in terms of the 27 naks.atras. Such a coordinate
system implies a calculation where whole cycles are subtracted from large
numbers. Such modular arithmetic appears to lie at the basis of the idea of
a superconjunction. Traditionally, the Ved¯a ˙nga Jyotis.a has been dated to
around 1350 BC, but a new paper by Narahari Achar9 argues for a much
earlier date of 1800 BC.

Van der Waerden10 has argued that a primitive epicycle theory was
known to the Greeks by the time of Plato. He argued such a theory might
have been known in the wider Indo-European world by early ﬁrst millen-
nium BC. With new ideas about the pre-history of the Indo-European world
emerging, it is possible to push this to an earlier millennium. An old theory
may be the source which led to the development of very diﬀerent epicycle
models in Greece and India.

The existence of an independent tradition of observation of planets and
a theory thereof as suggested by our analysis of the ´Satapatha Br¯ahman. a
helps explain the puzzle why the classical Indian astronomy of the Siddh¯anta
period uses many constants that are diﬀerent from those of the Greeks.

3 More on the Great Year

Since the yuga in the Vedic and the Br¯ahman. a periods is so clearly obtained
from an attempt to harmonize the solar and the lunar years, it appears that
the consideration of the periods of the planets was the basis of the creation
of an even longer yuga.

There is no reason to assume that the periods of the ﬁve planets were
unknown during the Br¯ahman. a age. I have argued that the astronomical
numbers in the organization of the R. gveda indicate with high probability
the knowledge of these periods in the R. gvedic era itself.11

4

Given these periods, and the various yugas related to the reconciliation
of the lunar and the solar years, we can see how the least common multiple
of these periods will deﬁne a still larger yuga.

The Mah¯abh¯arata and the Pur¯an. as speak of the kalpa, the day of Brahm¯a,
which is 4,320 million years long. The night is of equal length, and 360 such
days and nights constitute a “year” of Brahm¯a, and his life is 100 such years
long. The largest cycle is 311,040,000 million years long at the end of which
the world is absorbed within Brahman, until another cycle of creation. A
return to the initial conditions (implying a superconjunction) is inherent
in such a conception. Since the Indians and the Persians were in continu-
ing cultural contact, it is certain that this old tradition became a part of
the heritage of the Persians. This explains how we come across the idea
of the World-Year of 360,000 years in the work of Ab¯u Ma’shar, who also
mentioned a planetary conjunction in February 3102 BC.

The theory of the transmission of the Great Year of 432,000 years, de-
vised by Berossos, a priest in a Babylonian temple, to India in about 300
BC, was advanced by Pingree.12 But we see this number being used in rela-
tion to the Great Year in the ´Satapatha Br¯ahman. a itself, a long time before
Berossos.13

The idea of superconjunction seems to be at the basis of the cyclic cal-
endar systems in India. The ´Satapatha Br¯ahman. a speaks of a marriage
between the Seven Sages, the stars of the Ursa Major, and the Kr.ttik¯as;
this is elaborated in the Pur¯an. as where it is stated that the r.s.is remain for a
hundred years in each naks.atra. In other words, during the earliest times in
India there existed a centennial calendar with a cycle of 2,700 years. Called
the Saptars.i calendar, it is still in use in several parts of India. Its current
beginning is taken to be 3076 BE.

The usage of this calendar more than 2000 years ago is conﬁrmed by the
notices of the Greek historians Pliny and Arrian who suggest that, during
the Mauryan times, the Indian calendar began in 6676 BC. It seems quite
certain that this was the Saptars.i calendar with a beginning which starts
3600 years earlier than the current Saptars.i calendar.

The existence of a real cyclic calendar shows that the idea of supercon-
junction was a part of the Indic tradition much before the time of Berossos.
This idea was used elsewhere as well but, given the paucity of sources, it is
not possible to trace a deﬁnite place of origin for it.

4 Conclusions

More than thirty years ago, Roger Billard showed14 the falsity of the 19th
century notion that India did not have observational astronomy. His analy-
sis of the Siddh¯antic and the practical karan. a texts demonstrated that these
texts provide a set of elements from which the planetary positions for future
times can be computed. The ﬁrst step in these computations is the deter-
mination of the mean longitudes which are assumed to be linear functions
of time. Three more functions, the vernal equinox, the lunar node and the
lunar apogee are also deﬁned.

Billard investigated these linear functions for the ﬁve planets, two for
the sun (including the vernal equinox) and three for the moon. He checked
these calculations against the values derived from modern theory and he
found that the texts provide very accurate values for the epochs when they
were written. Since the Siddh¯anta and the karan. a models are not accurate,
beyond these epochs deviations build up. In other words, Billard refuted
the theory that there was no tradition of observational astronomy in India.
But Billard’s book is not easily available in India, which is why the earlier
theory has continued to do rounds in Indian literature.

¯Aryabhat.a’s constants are more accurate than the one’s available in the
West at that time. He took old Indic notions of the Great Yuga and of
cyclic time (implying superconjunction) and created a very original and
novel siddh¯anta. He presented the rotation information with respect to the
sun which means that his system was heliocentric to a certain extent.15
Furthermore, he considered the earth to be rotating on its own axis. Since
we don’t see such an advanced system amongst the Babylonians prior to the
time of ¯Aryabhat.a, it is not reasonable to look outside of the Indic tradition
or ¯Aryabhat.a himself for the data on which these ideas were based.

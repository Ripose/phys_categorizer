Einstein’s Violation of General Covariance

Einstein rejected the diﬀerential law of energy-momentum conservation
T µν
;ν = 0. In doing so, he violated the principle of general covariance. Here,
we prove the conservation law T µν
;ν = 0 and discuss its physical implications
for general relativity.

Abstract

1

In his founding paper on general relativity, Einstein stated the principle

of general covariance:

“The general laws of nature are to be expressed by equa-
tions which hold good for all systems of coordinates, that is, are
covariant with respect to any substitutions whatever (generally
covariant).” [1]

In that same paper, he rejected the diﬀerential law of energy-momentum
conservation

He writes as follows: the term Γµ
νλT νλ “shows that laws of conservation of
momentum and energy do not apply in the strict sense for matter alone”
[2]. This statement constitutes a direct violation of general covariance. All
textbook authors to date have followed Einstein’s erroneous lead in this
matter. Here are two exceptionally forthright quotations:

(a) the equations T µν
tion laws” [3];

(b) the equation T µν
law whatever” [4].

;ν = 0 “are not what can properly be called conserva-

;ν = 0 “does not generally express any conservation

It is not diﬃcult to prove the conservation law (1).

In ﬂat rectangu-
lar coordinates, xµ = (x0, x, y, z), conservation is expressed by the Lorentz
covariant equation

∂T µν
∂xν = 0
Suppose, instead, that we choose ordinary ﬂat spherical coordinates, xµ′
=
(x0, r, θ, φ). What will be the correct equation in the new coordinate system?
To answer this question, we begin with equation (2) and substitute the
transformed quantities

and arrive at the equation

This proves the diﬀerential law of energy-momentum conservation in the
spherical coordinate system. Because this law is generally covariant, it must
hold true for all systems of coordinates, ﬂat or curved.

The above method of proof makes clear that general covariance is a
purely mathematical requirement, which all laws of nature must satisfy. The
law of energy-momentum conservation is no exception. Einstein’s rejection
of this law had one important consequence: he attributed energy, momen-
tum, and stress to the gravitational ﬁeld. We will now make use of the
conservation law to show that the gravitational ﬁeld is free of energy, mo-
mentum, and stress. This follows immediately from the equation

T µν is the stress-energy-momentum tensor of matter and electromagnetism.
The covariant divergence of the left-hand side is identically zero, therefore

Rµν

gµν R = κ T µν

−

T µν
;ν = 0

This equation means that the energy-momentum of matter and electromag-
netism is conserved, at all space-time points. In other words, there is no
exchange of energy-momentum with the gravitational ﬁeld. Conclusion:
Einstein’s gravitational ﬁeld has no energy, momentum, or stress [5-9].

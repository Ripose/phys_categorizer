Abstract: We propose a new approach to the model of an origin of the universe
built by Oscar Klein and Hannes Alfv´en. Some modiﬁcations of assumptions under-
lying the model result in a possible scenario of the universe creation consistent with
observations. We explain the large scale structre of the universe and we estimate the
Hubble constant value as well as the number of galaxies in the universe. The model
does not require many assumptions made in the model based on the Big Bang idea.

1 Introduction

The Big Bang model has been considered to be the only currently valid one for
many years. However, there are some astronomical observations not explained
well enough what keeps forcing the Big Bang supporters to introduce new assump-
tions. For instance, the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe on large scales
(> 100 Mpc), its spatial ﬂatness, and also the distribution of galaxies as well as the
ﬂuctuations in the cosmic microwave background is explained by inﬂation proposed
by Alan H. Guth [9]. The discrepancy between the predicted and estimated uni-
verse matter density is eliminated by the assumption on an existence of dark barion
matter, exotic particles (WIMP), and dark energy [10]. The increasing universe
expansion rate is supposed to be covered by a non-zero value of the cosmological
constance [5, 13]. Also the problem of the initial conditions of the universe resulted
in many very abstract hypothesis not supported by experimentally veriﬁed physical
theories [3, 8, 14, 15].

Unfortunately, the broad approval of the Big Bang model and its further devel-
opment caused that alternative models sank into oblivion. In particular, the model
built by Oscar Klein and Hannes Alfv´en [1] in the 50-ties and 60-ties of last cen-
tury almost passed out of memory. Their model assumed that the universe evolved

from an ambiplsma cloud, i.e. a mixture of protons and antiprotons (heavy ambi-
plasma) as well as negatons and positons (light ambiplasma). Despite the idea in
a natural way explained the universe expansion it did not gain broad support and
ﬁnally was rejected. It was because the model was based on an assumption that the
matter-antimatter symmetry speciﬁc for the elementary particles scale is valid also
for the universe itself while none of astronomical observations indicated a large scale
antimatter clusters. Moreover, from this point of view the universe is extremely
asymmetric and antimatter exists only in trace amount.

We present a new approach to the model built by Klein and Alfv´en by introduc-
ing few modiﬁcations making the model much better ﬁtting the experimental and
observational facts. The main change is a rejection of the original assumption on the
perfect matter-antimatter symmetry. It results in an alternative to the Big Bang
model explaining our universe evolution without many additional assumptions.

2 Creation of the observed universe

To start building the universe model one should accept an assumption on existence
of a mother space. The space is three-dimensional and Euklidesian at large scale
but locally the space geometry can diﬀer from Euklidesian as well as an energetic
ﬂuctuations can occur. The physics laws result from the mother space properties.

2.1 An ambiplasma cloud creation

As a consequence of energy ﬂuctuations and high energy photons collisions matter-
antimatter particle pairs are created. Unstable particles disintegrate and, ﬁnally,
only few kinds of particles survive: photons, neutrinos and antineutrinos, negatons
and positons, as well as protons and antiprotons. A chaotic movement of the parti-
cles results in macroscopic ﬂuctuations, i.e. regions of increased ambiplasma density.
Gravity force enhances the spatial accumulations creating ambiplasma clouds which
start an independent evolution.

The most probably cloud’s composition is balanced – there should be roughly
the same amount of matter and antimatter. For instance, if the probabilities of
being an antimatter and a matter particle read p and q = 1
p respectively, than
having N particles the expected (or the average) number of particles reads µ = Np
and its standard deviation equals to σ =
p). The relative error reads

Np(1

p)/(Np) so having 1080 particles and p

q

≈

−

(1

σ/µ =
1/2 one has an immediate
result that the statistical ﬂuctuations are of order of 10−40 and they are meaningless.
Nevertheless, the above result is obtained by an assumption, that the probability of
matter (p) and antimatter q = 1
p particle creation is the same. If one takes into
consideration a possible diﬀerence between the probabilities the situation changes
and a cloud with more matter than antimatter can be created. The diﬀerence seems
to be not big but from the other hand it is suggested by CP symmetry breaking
known from the elementary particles physics. So the statistical ﬂuctuation is still
not signiﬁcant but the average number of particles and antiparticles are diﬀerent and
the diﬀerence reads N(2p
1). As a consequence from a large number of created

ambiplasma clouds some of them can be unbalanced and contain more matter than
antimatter (or vice versa).

Despite of an asymmetric matter-antimatter composition a given cloud has to
be electrically (quasi)neutral. If a cloud with a net positive electrical charge was
created it would attract more negatons than antiprotons since negatons are more
mobile. This means that a cloud with more matter than antimatter (i.e. with more
protons) would increase the matter-antimatter asymmetry and a cloud with more
antimatter would evolve toward symmetry. Again, if a cloud with a net negative
electrical charge was created it would attract more positons than protons since
positons are more mobile. As a consequence a cloud with more antimatter than
matter (i.e. more antiprotons) would increase the matter-antimatter asymmetry
and a cloud with more matter would evolve toward symmetry. Finally one can ﬁnd
both symmetric and asymmetric ambiplasma clouds but both kinds should have
zero net charge.

2.2 Evolution of a cloud

One should consider three forces acting on a given volume element of the cloud:

where γ is a gravity ﬁeld intensity, m is a particle mass, n is a number of particles
in the volume element, e is an electrical charge, E is an electrical ﬁeld intensity, k
is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and r is a distance from the
cloud’s center. The net force

F =

results in a particle movement and draws the system to the equilibrium (when
F = 0). The process was analyzed in details by Alfv´en [1] and we present only the
basic steps.

When the cloud is in thermodynamical equilibrium the equation (1) transforms

to

where ν = γm/(kT ) and φ = eE/(kT ). The solution of (2) reads

(1)

(2)

where η denotes the given component density in the could’s centre. The cloud
has to be electrical neutral both globally as well as locally, so the concentrations

For a symmetric ambiplasma cloud we have n+

and

respectively. From the above it follows that there is no separation of matter and
anti-matter, but a light fraction is separated from the heavy one. Regions with the
same density have mp/me = 1836 times diﬀerent depth. The Electrical ﬁeld does
not exist – substituting the above equations to (2) one gets E = 0.

2.2.3 Asymmetric ambiplasma – more matter than anti-matter

In this case the cloud splits into three regions [1]:

1. A central one consisting of symmetric heavy ambiplasma. There is few nega-

tons and even less positons. Electric ﬁeld intensity is 0.

2. A transitional region with both matter and anti-matter, but the concentration
of antiprotons is much less than in the central region and decreases fast towards
the surface of the cloud. The negatons’ and protons’ concentrations are equals
but they are bigger than a concentration of positons. The electric ﬁeld intensity
reads E = γmp/(2e).

3. A surface region with symmetric light ambiplasma and no electric ﬁeld.

The components concentration dependence on depth is presented in Fig. 1. An
asymmetric cloud with more anti-matter splits into analogous regions.

Probability of creation of a cloud composed only of matter or anti-matter is so
small that the cases can be not considered as a possible way of the universe creation.
If one do not exclude a possibility that probabilities of creation of a matter and an
antimatter particle are not perfectly the same then also ideally symmetric cloud
is not very likely to be created. So the possible universe creation scenario should
be developed based on an asymmetric ambiplasma cloud with the three regions
described above.

2.3 Annihilation inside the ambiplasma cloud

Electrons annihilation forced by weak interaction is very little probably and does
not matter for the cloud evolution. As a most probably result of reactions driven by
electromagnetic forces two photons are created. In a non-relativistic approach the
average life time of a positon in negatons gas is given by Dirac formula

τe =

where n−

and r0 is the classic electron’s radius.

Annihilation of protons is mainly driven by strong interaction and results in
pions’ creation. An average life time of an antiproton in a gas of protons is given by

τp =

kp

,

where kp ≈
1 and is almost constant until velocities reaches relativistic region.
Unstable particles created during the protons annihilation disintegrate fast and only
few kinds of particle survive: electrons carrying 16% of the emitted energy, neutrinos
(50% of the energy) and photons (34% of the energy) [16].

Substitution of the parameters’ values to the formulas (10) and (11) results in
the average life time of an antiproton (or a positon) as a function of particles (i.e.
protons or electrons) concentration

and is based on an assumption that the created positons and negatons also annihi-
late.

It follows from the equations (12) and (13) that in a symmetrical ambiplasma
cloud the power of radiation emitted as a result of protons annihilation is about 900
times greater than the power generated by electrons annihilation. For this reason
we neglect the impact of the electrons annihilation. Assuming npmp = ρ the power
of radiation can be given as a function of the cloud density

In the ﬁrst stages of the cloud evolution the number of particles and their con-
centration change very slowly and the annihilation rate is also almost constant. The

The temperature is proportional to the 4-th root of the time so when the cloud
formulates and its density is small and slowly varying the annihilation almost does
not impact the cloud’s evolution.

2.4 Second step of the cloud evolution

Just after the cloud creates in the mother space its radiation and electrostatic ener-
gies are very small so the main factor of its energy is gravity one given by

Since the gravity energy is negative the cloud starts contracting. The contraction
stopps when the radius of the cloud is not smaller than its gravity radius

(15)

(16)

since if the size of the cloud were lower the cloud would collapse. M0 is the initial
mass of the cloud. So the upper limit for the cloud density reads

Ep =

During hel synthesis of two protons 0.7% of the reagents’ mass changes into
energy. Comparing to the annihilation process the hel synthesis one is much less ef-
fective and supplies the cloud with much less energy. For the reason one can assume
that the thermonuclear reactions do not impact the cloud evolution if only there is
enough of heavy ambiplasma. Half of energy created in positon – negaton annihila-
tion is carried by neutrinos so it is in practice lost since the particles do not interact
with matter. Only the second half of the energy is distributed between electrons,

7

positons, and γ quants. In the ﬁrst step of the cloud evolution the processes run
slowly so there is a possibility of annihilation of electrons and positons and an equi-
librium between matter and antimatter is reached. Thanks to this matter reaches
kinetic energy big enough to initiate the could expansion. To get enough kinetic
energy the cloud mass has to be reduced by about 60% of its initial value.

When the cloud keeps contracting the annihilation rate in its interior increases
and as a result temperature and pressure also increase. The conditions are not
suitable for its internal structure formulation. Nevertheless, in its external part
containing almost pure matter the temperature is lower and decreasing diameter of
the cloud is suitable for generation of ﬂuctuations.

The radiation of power P results in momentum transport and its intensity is

given by

The pressure of the radiation results in a force acting on a unit of the cloud volume

where ξ is the radiation absorption coeﬃcient

ne denotes electrons concentration and ζ ranges from 0.1 to 1 since depending on
the radiation energy the interaction with matter is mainly by photoelectrical phe-
nomenon, Compton disperse, or creating of couples negaton-positon.

Combining formulas (14), (17), and (18) we get a force coming from the radiation
pressure and acting on a unit of the cloud volume distant by r from the cloud centre

and the gravity force equals to

The radial acceleration of a unit volume of the cloud is given by

The delay between the radiation creation and the pressure appearance follows

from the limited speed of light and is important for the universe evolution.

Bonnevier made an exact analysis of the equations describing the symmetric
ambiplasma cloud evolution [2]. He got many diﬀerent models depending on values
of the parameters. The models can be split into two main groups (Fig. 2):

1. oscillating until the cloud loses its mass because of its completely annihilation,

2. unlimited expanding after the initial phase of contraction.

In the case of the asymmetric ambiplasma cloud the results mean that in the
central section of the cloud the annihilation process continues until the matter and
antimatter completely vanish changing into energy. The region can oscillate but can
not expand unlimited since it is surrounded by layer of matter. This layer keeps the
central section compressed and depending on how much mass the cloud lost in the
annihilation process it collapses into black hole or expands.

2.5 Third step of the cloud evolution

When the cloud contracts its density increases and the annihilation speeds up. As a
consequence more radiation is created and its pressure makes the cloud contraction
slower. If there is enough energy to stop the contraction the cloud begin to expand.
The total cloud energy has to be at least non-negative to initiate expansion.
It
means that at least 60% of its initial mass M0 has to be annihilated and the emitted
energy has to be absorbed by the layer surrounding the centre. Taking into account
that half of the energy is carried out by neutrinos we have that

From equation (24) it follows that the velocity what can be reached by the external
layer of the could in this stage of the cloud evolution equals to

The speed at which a distance between two parts of the external layers increases

When the cloud stops contracting and starts expanding the transitional region

decreases. It is because of two reasons:

1. Gravity force is bigger for the layers more distant from the centre of the cloud,

and

2. Radiation pressure (so also a force acting on a unit surface) decreases propor-

tional to square of the distance from the centre.

So the net inward force is bigger for layers more distant from the centre.

The phenomena supports increasing of the ﬂuctuations and since the layer is
thinner and thinner the ﬂuctuations should create a set of ﬁbers or sponge-like
structures.

When the cloud switches from contraction to expansion there can still be some
unannihilated symmetrical ambiplasma in its central region. In this case the radia-
tion is still created in the centre of the cloud and the its power changes periodically
as a result of the kernel pulses. So the speed of the external layer expansion can be
slowed down and than again accelerated. Another consequence of the central region
pulses can be creation of a standing wave. When temperature falls dawn below
3000K and atoms are created the velocity of the wave is given by

where Cp/Cv ≈

If one assumes that the average velocity of the pulses reads ˆv = 2r/τ than the
number of the knots equals to

n = πˆv

(27)

The number of knots on a surface of a sphere is of order of n2 and deﬁnes a number
of matter concentrations. The concentrations could be origins of galactics or groups
of galactics, analogous to ours Local Group.

The cloud still expands and after a time long enough it spreads out and vanishes

in the mother space.

3 Observed properties of the universe

Following the model presented in the previous section we can reconstruct the evo-
lution of the universe. An ambiplasma cloud with zero total electric charge and
not symmetrical matter-antimatter composition is created in a mother space as a

10

result of macroscopic ﬂuctuations. Its initial mass and quantity of matter and an-
timatter can be estimated using the currently known values of diﬀerent universe
parameters [6, 7]. Observations of a shining or luminous matter indicate that there
can be over 1078 nucleons. Analysis of galaxies dynamics suggest that there can be
some ﬁve times more of a dark matter which can be detected only by gravity forces.
One does not know what is its composition but it can be just barion matter. So an
assumption that there are over 1079 nucleons in the universe seems to be reasonable
1052 kg. From the model it fol-
and as a consequence its mass equals to Mu = 5
lows that it is not more than approx. 40% of the initial mass of the cloud. So at
the moment of its origins the cloud consisted of 1080 protons and antiprotons and
its mass was about Mu,0 = 1053 kg. Its radius probably was close to the gravity
1026 m and an average density equaled to
radius of the cloud and read rg = 1.5
ρ0 = 10−27 [kg/m3]. Of course the numbers are only an estimation but their order
of magnitude gives an idea on the initial conditions of the universe evolution.

·

·

When the cloud was created gravity forces made it evolving and at the ﬁrst step
of the evolution three layers of the cloud were created: the central one made of
heavy ambiplasma of symmetric matter-antimatter composition and of weight of
Mu,0; a middle layer made of only matter; and the surface layer made
approx. 60%
of symmetric light ambiplasma. All currently observed objects were created of the
matter in the middle layer. The process of ﬂuctuations origination probably started
in the contraction phase of the evolution. At the beginning of the expansion phase
protogalaxies were created and after this ﬁrst stars were born.

·

The oldest observed stars in the universe are aged about 12

109 years so if
one assume that they were created just after the contraction phase switched into
the expansion phase one gets that the R parameter in the formula (25) equals to
1026 m. An analogous result can be obtained if one tries to estimate the R value
R
using the critical density. The density is supposed to read about 10−26 [kg/m3] and
1052 kg
the value of an average density is get for a spherical cloud of a mass of 5
and a radius 1026 m. For the value of R the Hubble constant reads

Comparison of the density value with the value estimated for the initial conditions
shows that the density increased 104 times so the size of the cloud decreased about
20 times. The gravity pressure in this region can be estimated as a weight of the

where rm is a depth of the matter layer. There are not enough data to estimate the

The reaction run also in the opposite direction resulting in neutrons disintegration so
an equilibrium state can be reached between number of protons and neutrons. When
the cloud contraction switches into the cloud expansion the matter temperature
starts to decrease. It results in faster neutrons disintegration than their synthesis

so their concentration begins to decrease. Nevertheless not every neutron vanishes
since at the temperature of 109 K deuter is synthesized and than helium nucleus
are created. It is not clear if the proportion between diﬀerent elements’ nucleous
concentration is in line with observations [11] and answering the question requires
further studies on the model.

5 Conclusion

The presented model can not be called a complete one but it shows an interesting
way competitive to the Big Bang model. Even if the model is diﬃcult to be accepted
since the Big Bang model is considered to be the currently valid one its consideration
can open a door to solution of many problems existing in the Big Band model.
Moreover, the presented model has many advantages comparing to the Big Bang
model:

1. Basing on experimental veriﬁed physical laws it explains the universe expan-

sion.

2. It omits the problem with the original singularity.

3. It does not require an assumption about existence of inﬂation.

4. It explains origins of the background radiation and its power distribution.

5. It explains big scale universe structure consistent with observations.

6. It does not require assumptions on exotic matter components and dark energy.

7. It shows that even before ﬁrst stars were born in the ﬁrst stage of the universe
evolution there had existed conditions necessary for complex atomic nucleus
creation.

For this reason the model deserves to be analyzed and to be considered as a

possible walk around of many existing problems with the universe evolution.

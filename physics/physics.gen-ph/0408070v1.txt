of the mesons, baryons and leptons

The rest masses of the stable mesons and baryons and the rest masses of their
antiparticles, as well as the rest masses of the µ± and τ ± leptons can be explained,
within 1% accuracy, with the standing wave model, which uses only photons,
neutrinos, charge and the weak nuclear force. And we can explain the spin of the
stable mesons and baryons and the spin of the µ± and τ ± leptons without any
additional assumption. We can also determine the rest masses of the e, µ and τ
neutrinos.

Introduction

The so-called “Standard Model” of the elementary particles has, until now,
not come up with a precise theoretical determination of the masses of either
the mesons and baryons or of the leptons, which means that neither the
mass of the fundamental electron nor the mass of the fundamental proton
have been explained. This is so although the quarks, the foundation of the
standard model, have been introduced by Gell-Mann [1] forty years ago.
The masses of the quarks which are considered range from zero rest mass
to values from 1.5 to 4.5 MeV for e.g. the u-quark, according to the Review
of Particle Physics [2], to values on the order of 100 MeV. Suppose one has
agreed on deﬁnite values of the masses of the various quarks then one stands
before the same problem one has faced with the conventional elementary
particles, namely one has to explain why the quarks have their particular
masses and what they are made of. The other most frequently referred to
theory dealing with the elementary particles, the “String Theory” introduced
by Witten [3] about twenty years ago, or its successor the superstring theory,
have despite their mathematical elegance not led to experimentally veriﬁable
results. There are many other attempts to explain the elementary particles

1

or only one of the particles, too many to list them here. There have been,
for example, in the last years, the articles of El Naschie on a general theory
for high energy particles and the spectrum of the quarks [4-7]. Our model
and El Naschie’s mechanical model version of his topological theory are not
far apart.

1 The spectrum of the masses of the particles

As we have done before [8] we will focus attention on the so-called “stable”
mesons and baryons whose masses are reproduced with other data in Tables
1 and 2. It is obvious that any attempt to explain the masses of the mesons
and baryons should begin with the particles that are aﬀected by the fewest
parameters. These are certainly the particles without isospin (I = 0) and
without spin (J = 0), but also with strangeness S = 0, and charm C = 0.
Looking at the particles with I,J,S,C = 0 it is startling to ﬁnd that their
masses are quite close to integer multiples of the mass of the π0 meson. It
is m(η) = (1.0140 ± 0.0003) · 4m(π0), and the mass of the resonance η′ is
m(η′) = (1.0137 ± 0.00015) · 7m(π0). Three particles seem hardly to be
suﬃcient to establish a rule. However, if we look a little further we ﬁnd
that m(Λ) = 1.0332 · 8m(π0) or m(Λ) = 1.0190 · 2m(η). We note that the
Λ particle has spin 1/2, not spin 0 as the π0, η mesons. Nevertheless, the
mass of Λ is close to 8m(π0). Furthermore we have m(Σ0) = 0.9817 · 9m(π0),
m(Ξ0) = 0.9742 · 10m(π0), m(Ω−) = 1.0325 · 12m(π0) = 1.0183 · 3m(η), (Ω−
is charged and has spin 3/2). Finally the masses of the charmed baryons are
m(Λ+
c) = 1.0093 · 18m(π0), m(Ξ0
c)
= 1.0167 · 18m(π0), and m(Ω0

c) = 1.0017 · 20m(π0).
Now we have enough material to formulate the integer multiple rule, ac-
cording to which the masses of the η, Λ, Σ0, Ξ0, Ω−, Λ+
c, and Ω0
c
particles are, in a ﬁrst approximation, integer multiples of the mass of the
π0 meson, although some of the particles have spin, and may also have charge
as well as strangeness and charm. A consequence of the integer multiple rule
must be that the ratio of the mass of any meson or baryon listed above
divided by the mass of another meson or baryon listed above is equal to
the ratio of two integer numbers. And indeed, for example m(η)/m(π0) is
practically two times (exactly 0.9950 · 2) the ratio m(Λ)/m(η). There is also
the ratio m(Ω−)/m(Λ) = 0.9993 · 3/2. We have furthermore e.g. the ratios
m(Λ)/m(η) = 1.019 · 2, m(Ω−)/m(η) = 1.018 · 3, m(Λ+
c )/m(Λ) = 1.02399 · 2,

We will call, for reasons to be explained later, the particles discussed
above, which follow in a ﬁrst approximation the integer multiple rule, the
γ-branch of the particle spectrum. The mass ratios of these particles are in
Table 1. The deviation of the mass ratios from exact integer multiples of
m(π0) is at most 3.3%, the average of the factors before the integer multiples
of m(π0) of the nine γ-branch particles in Table 1 is 1.0066 ± 0.0184. From
a least square analysis follows that the masses of the ten particles on Table
1 lie on a straight line given by the formula

m(N)/m(π0) = 1.0065 N − 0.0043

N ≥ 1,

(1)

where N is the integer number nearest to the actual ratio of the particle mass
divided by m(π0). The correlation coeﬃcient in equation (1) has the nearly
perfect value r2 = 0.999.

The integer multiple rule applies to more than just the stable mesons
and baryons. The integer multiple rule applies also to the γ-branch baryon
resonances which have spin J = 1/2 and the meson resonances with I,J = 0,
listed in [2] or in Tables 2,3 in [8]. The Ω− particle will not be considered
because it has spin 3/2 but would not change the following equation signiﬁ-
cantly. If we combine the particles in Table 1 with the γ-branch meson and
baryon resonances, that means if we consider all mesons and baryons of the
γ-branch, “stable” or unstable, with I ≤ 1, J ≤ 1/2 then we obtain from a
least square analysis the formula

m(N)/m(π0) = 1.0056 N + 0.0610

N ≥ 1,

(2)

with the correlation coeﬃcient 0.9986. The line through the points is shown
in Fig. 1 which tells that 22 particles of the γ-branch of diﬀerent spin and
isospin, strangeness and charm; eight I,J = 0,0 mesons, thirteen J = 1/2
baryons and the π0 meson with I,J = 1,0, lie on a straight line with slope
1.0056. In other words they approximate the integer multiple rule very well.
Searching for what else the π0, η, Λ, Σ0, Ξ0, Ω− particles have in common,
we ﬁnd that the principal decays (decays with a fraction > 1%) of these par-
ticles, as listed in Table 1, involve primarily γ-rays, the characteristic case
is π0 → γγ (98.8%). We will later on discuss a possible explanation for
the 1.198% of the decays of π0 which do not follow the γγ route. After the
γ-rays the next most frequent decay product of the heavier particles of the

γ-branch are π0 mesons which again decay into γγ. To describe the decays
in another way, the principal decays of the particles listed above take place
always without the emission of neutrinos ; see Table 1. There the decays and
the fractions of the principal decay modes are given, taken from the Review
of Particle Physics. We cannot consider decays with fractions < 1%. We will
refer to the particles whose masses are approximately integer multiples of the
mass of the π0 meson, and which decay without the emission of neutrinos, as
the γ-branch of the particle spectrum.

To summarize the facts concerning the γ-branch. Within 0.66% on the
average the masses of the particles of the γ-branch are integer multiples
(namely 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and even 17, 18, 20) of the mass of the π0 meson. It
is improbable that nine particles have masses so close to integer multiples
of m(π0) if there is no correlation between them and the π0 meson. It has,

5

on the other hand, been argued that the integer multiple rule is a numerical
coincidence. But the probability that the mass ratios of the γ-branch fall
by coincidence on integer numbers between 1 and 20 instead on all possible
numbers between 1 and 20 with two decimals after the period is smaller than
10−20, i.e nonexistent. The integer multiple rule is not aﬀected by more than
3% by the spin, the isospin, the strangeness, and by charm. The integer
multiple rule seems even to apply to the Ω− and Λ+
c particles, although they
are charged. In order for the integer multiple rule to be valid the deviation
of the ratio m/m(π0) from an integer number must be smaller than 1/2N,
where N is the integer number closest to the actual ratio m/m(π0). That
means that the permissible deviation decreases rapidly with increased N. All
particles of the γ-branch have deviations smaller than 1/2N.

The remainder of the stable mesons and baryons are the π±, K±,0, p, n,
s particles which make up the ν-branch of the particle spectrum.

D±,0, and D±
The ratios of their masses are given in Table 2.

considers the mass of a particular charged or neutral particle. After the
π mesons, the largest mass diﬀerence between charged and neutral particles
is that of the K mesons (0.81%), and thereafter all mass diﬀerences between
charged and neutral particles are < 0.5%. The integer multiple rule does
not immediately apply to the masses of the ν-branch particles if m(π±) (or
m(π0)) is used as reference, because m(K±) = 0.8843 · 4m(π±). 0.8843 · 4 =
3.537 is far from integer. Since the masses of the π0 meson and the π± mesons
diﬀer by only 3.4% it has been argued that the π± mesons are, but for the
isospin, the same particles as the π0 meson, and that therefore the π± cannot
start another particle branch. However, this argument is not supported by
the completely diﬀerent decays of the π0 mesons and the π± mesons. The
π0 meson decays almost exclusively into γγ (98.8%), whereas the π± mesons
decay practically exclusively into µ mesons and neutrinos, as in π+ → µ+ +
νµ (99.9877%). Furthermore, the lifetimes of the π0 and the π± mesons diﬀer
by nine orders of magnitude, being τ (π0) = 8.4 · 10−17 sec versus τ (π±) =
2.6 · 10−8 sec.

If we make the π± mesons the reference particles of the ν-branch, then
we must multiply the mass ratios m/m(π±) of the above listed particles with
an average factor 0.848 ± 0.025, as follows from the mass ratios on Ta-
ble 2. The integer multiple rule may, however, apply directly if one makes

m(K±) the reference for masses larger than m(K±). The mass of the neutron
is 0.9516 · 2m(K±), which is only a fair approximation to an integer multi-
ple. There are, on the other hand, outright integer multiples in m(D±) =
s ) = 0.9968 · 4m(K±). A least square
0.9954 · (m(p) + m(n)), and in m(D±
analysis of the masses of the ν-branch in Table 2 yields the formula

m(N)/0.853m(π±) = 1.000 N + 0.00575

N ≥ 1,

(3)

with r2 = 0.998. This means that the particles of the ν-branch are integer
multiples of m(π±) times the factor 0.853. One must, however, consider
that the π± mesons are not necessarily the perfect reference for all ν-branch
particles, because π± has I = 1, whereas for example K± has I = 1/2 and S
= ±1 and the neutron has also I = 1/2. Actually the factor 0.853 in Eq.(3)
is only an average. The mass ratios indicate that this factor decreases slowly
with increased m(N). The existence of the factor and its decrease will be
explained later.

Contrary to the particles of the γ-branch, the ν-branch particles decay
preferentially with the emission of neutrinos, the foremost example is π± →
µ± + νµ(¯νµ) with a fraction of 99.9877%. Neutrinos characterize the weak
interaction. We will refer to the particles in Table 2 as the neutrino branch
(ν-branch) of the particle spectrum. We emphasize that a weak decay of the
particles of the ν-branch is by no means guaranteed. Although the neutron
decays via n → p + e− + ¯νe in 887 sec (100%), the proton is stable. There are,
on the other hand, decays as e.g. K+ → π+π−π+ (5.59%), but the subsequent
decays of the π± mesons lead to neutrinos and e±. The decays of the particles
in the ν-branch follow a mixed rule, either weak or electromagnetic.

To summarize the facts concerning the ν-branch of the mesons and bary-
ons. The masses of these particles seem to follow the integer multiple rule if
one uses the π± meson as reference, however the mass ratios share a common
factor 0.85 ± 0.025.

To summarize what we have learned about the integer multiple rule: In
spite of diﬀerences in charge, spin, strangeness, and charm the masses of the
mesons and baryons of the γ-branch are integer multiples of the mass of the
π0 meson within at most 3.3% and on the average within 0.66%. Correspond-
ingly, the masses of the particles of the ν-branch are, after multiplication with
a factor 0.85 ± 0.025, integer multiples of the mass of the π± mesons. The
validity of the integer multiple rule can easily be veriﬁed with a calculator
from the data in the Review of Particle Physics. The integer multiple rule

8

has been anticipated much earlier by Nambu [9], who wrote in 1952 that
“some regularity [in the masses of the particles] might be found if the masses
were measured in a unit of the order of the π-meson mass”. A similar sug-
gestion has been made by Fr¨ohlich [10]. The integer multiple rule suggests
that the particles are the result of superpositions of modes and higher modes
of a wave equation.

2 Standing waves in a cubic lattice and the

particles of the γ-branch

We will now study, as we have done in [11], whether the so-called “stable”
particles of the γ-branch cannot be described by the frequency spectrum
of standing waves in a cubic lattice, which can accommodate automatically
the Fourier frequency spectrum of an extreme short-time collision by which
the particles are created. The investigation of the consequences of lattices
for particle theory was initiated by Wilson [12] who studied a cubic fermion
lattice. This study has developed over time into lattice QCD.

It will be necessary for the following to outline the most elementary as-
pects of the theory of lattice oscillations. The classic paper describing lattice
oscillations is from Born and v. Karman [13], henceforth referred to as B&K.
They looked at ﬁrst at the oscillations of a one-dimensional chain of points
with mass m, separated by a constant distance a. This is the monatomic
case, all lattice points have the same mass. B&K assume that the forces
exerted on each point of the chain originate only from the two neighboring
points. These forces are opposed to and proportional to the displacements,
as with elastic springs (Hooke’s law). The equation of motion is in this case

m¨un = α(un+1 − un) − α(un − un−1) .

(4)

The un are the displacements of the mass points from their equilibrium posi-
tion which are apart by the distance a. The dots signify, as usual, diﬀerenti-
ation with respect to time, α is a constant characterizing the force between
the lattice points, and n is an integer number. For a → 0 Eq.(4) becomes
the wave equation c2∂2u/∂x2 = ∂2u/∂t2 (B&K).

In order to solve (4) B&K set

un = Aei(ω t + nφ) ,

(5)

9

which is obviously a temporally and spatially periodic solution. n is an
integer, with n < N, where N is the number of points in the chain. φ = 0
is the monochromatic case. We also consider higher modes, by replacing nφ
in Eq.(5) with ℓnφ, with integer ℓ > 1. The wavelengths are then shorter by
1/ℓ. At nφ = π/2 there are nodes, where for all times t the displacements
are zero, as with standing waves. If a displacement is repeated after n points
we have na = λ, where λ is the wavelength, a the lattice constant, and it
must be nφ = 2π according to (5). It follows that

λ = 2πa/φ .

(6)

(7)

Inserting (5) into (4) one obtains a continuous frequency spectrum given

by Eq.(5) of B&K

ω = ± 2

α/m sin(φ/2) .

q

B&K point out that there is not only a continuum of frequencies, but also a
maximal frequency which is reached when φ = π, or at the minimum of the
possible wavelengths λ = 2a. The boundary conditions are periodic, that
means that un = un+N , where N is the number of points in the chain. Born
referred to the periodic boundary condition as a “mathematical convenience”.
The number of normal modes must be equal to the number of particles in
the lattice.

The theory of lattice oscillations has been pursued in particular by Black-
man [14], a summary of his and other studies is in [15]. Comprehensive re-
views of the results of linear studies of lattice dynamics have been written by
Born and Huang [16], by Maradudin et al. [17], and by Ghatak and Kothari
[18].

3 The masses of the γ-branch particles

We will now assume, as seems to be quite natural, that the particles con-
sist of the same particles into which they decay, directly or ultimately. We
know this from atoms, which consist of nuclei and electrons, and from nuclei,
which consist of protons and neutrons. Quarks have never appeared among
the decay products of elementary particles. For the γ-branch particles our
assumption means that they consist of photons. Photons and π0 mesons
are the principal decay products of the γ-branch particles, the characteristic

10

example is π0 → γγ (98.8%). Table 1 shows that there are decays of the
γ-branch particles which lead to particles of the ν-branch, in particular to
pairs of π+ and π− mesons. It appears that this has to do with pair pro-
duction in the γ-branch particles. Pair production is evident in the decay
π0 → e+ + e− + γ (1.198%) or in the π0 meson’s third most frequent decay
π0 → e+e−e+e− (3.14·10−3%). Pair production requires the presence of elec-
tromagnetic waves of high energy. Anyway, the explanation of the γ-branch
particles must begin with the explanation of the most simple example of its
kind, the π0 meson, which by all means seems to consist of photons. The
composition of the particles of the γ-branch suggested here oﬀers a direct
route from the formation of a γ-branch particle, through its lifetime, to its
decay products. Particles that are made of photons are necessarily neutral,
as the majority of the particles of the γ-branch are.

We also base our assumption that the particles of the γ-branch are made
of photons on the circumstances of the formation of the γ-branch particles.
The most simple and straightforward creation of a γ-branch particle are
the reactions γ + p → π0 + p, or in the case that the spins of γ and p
are parallel γ + p → π0 + p + γ′. A photon impinges on a proton and
creates a π0 meson. The considerations which follow apply as well for other
photoproductions such as γ + p → η + p or γ + d → π0 + d, but also for
the electroproductions e− + p → π0 + e− + p or e− + d → π0 + e− + d,
see Rekalo et al. [19].

In γ + p → π0 + p the pulse of the incoming electromagnetic wave is in
10−23 sec converted into a continuum of electromagnetic waves with frequen-
cies ranging from 1023 sec−1 to ν → ∞ according to Fourier analysis. There
must be a cutoﬀ frequency, otherwise the energy in the sum of the frequencies
would exceed the energy of the incoming electromagnetic wave. The wave
packet so created decays, according to experience, after 8.4 · 10−17 sec into two
electromagnetic waves or γ-rays. It seems to be very unlikely that Fourier
analysis does not hold for the case of an electromagnetic wave impinging on
a proton. The question then arises of what happens to the electromagnetic
waves in the timespan of 10−16 seconds between the creation of the wave
packet and its decay into two γ-rays? We will investigate whether the elec-
tromagnetic waves cannot continue to exist for the 10−16 seconds until the
wave packet decays.

If the wave packet created by the collision of a γ-ray with a proton consists
of electromagnetic waves, then the waves cannot be progressive because the
wave packet must have a rest mass. However standing electromagnetic waves

11

can have a rest mass. Standing electromagnetic waves are equivalent to a
lattice and the lattice oscillations can absorb the continuum of frequencies
of the Fourier spectrum of the collision. So we assume that the very many

unprecedented that photons have been considered to be building blocks of
the elementary particles. Schwinger [20] has once studied an exact one-
dimensional quantum electrodynamical model in which the photon acquired
a mass ∼ e2. On the other hand, it has been suggested by Sidharth [21] that
the π0 meson consists of an electron and a positron which circle their center
of mass.

We will now investigate the standing waves of a cubic photon lattice.
We assume that the lattice is held together by a weak force acting from
one lattice point to the next. We assume that the range of this force is
10−16 cm, because the range of the weak nuclear force is on the order of
10−16 cm, according to Perkins [22]. The range of the weak force is of the
same magnitude as the uncertainty ∆x = a/π of the location of a wavepacket
whose energy E is ≈ πhν0/2 = π/2·hc/2πa, where the energy E is the average
energy of the photons in a lattice with the lattice constant a, as we will
see later. For the sake of simplicity we set the sidelength of the lattice at
10−13 cm, the exact size of the nucleon is given in [23] and will be used
later. With a = 10−16 cm there are then 109 lattice points. As we will
see the ratios of the masses of the photon lattices are independent of the
sidelength of the lattice. Because it is the most simple case, we assume that
a central force acts between the lattice points. We cannot consider spin,
isospin, strangeness or charm of the particles. The frequency equation for
the oscillations of an isotropic monatomic cubic lattice with central forces is,
in the one-dimensional case, given by Eq.(7). The direction of the oscillation
is determined by the direction of the incoming wave.

According to Eq.(13) of B&K the force constant α is

α = a(c11 − c12 − c44) ,

(8)

where c11, c12 and c44 are the elastic constants in continuum mechanics which
applies in the limit a → 0. If we consider central forces then c12 = c44 which is
the classical Cauchy relation. Isotropy requires that c44 = (c11 − c12)/2. The
waves are longitudinal. Transverse waves in a cubic lattice with concentric
forces are not possible according to [18]. All frequencies that solve Eq.(7)
come with either a plus or a minus sign which is, as we will see, important.

The reference frequency is

or as we will see, using Eq.(11), ν0 = c⋆/2πa.

For a photon lattice that means, since cg must then always be equal to

distribution regardless of the order of the mode of oscillation or it means that
instead of the sine function in Eq.(7) the frequency is given by

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

The frequencies of the corrected spectrum must increase from ν = 0
at the origin φ = 0 with slope 1 (in units of ν0) until the maximum is
reached at φ = π. The energy contained in the oscillations (Eq.14) must be
proportional to the sum of all frequencies. The second mode of the lattice
oscillations contains 4 times as much energy as the basic mode, because
the frequencies are twice the frequencies of the basic mode, and there are

ν = ν0φ .

13

twice as many oscillations. Adding, by superposition, to the second mode
diﬀerent numbers of basic modes or of second modes will give exact integer
multiples of the energy of the basic mode. Now we understand the integer
multiple rule of the particles of the γ-branch. There is, in the framework
of this theory, on account of Eq.(13), no alternative but integer multiples of
the basic mode for the energy contained in the frequencies of the diﬀerent
modes or for superpositions of diﬀerent modes. In other words, the masses
of the diﬀerent particles are integer multiples of the mass of the π0 meson,
assuming that there is no spin, isospin, strangeness or charm.

We remember that the measured masses in Table 1, which incorporate
diﬀerent spins, isospins, strangeness, and charm spell out the integer mul-
tiple rule within on the average 0.66% accuracy.
It is worth noting that
there is no free parameter if one takes the ratio of the energies contained in
α/m
the frequency distributions of the diﬀerent modes, because the factor
in Eq.(7) cancels. This means, in particular, that the ratios of the frequency
distributions, or the mass ratios, are independent of the mass of the photons
at the lattice points, as well as of the magnitude of the force between the
lattice points.

q

It is obvious that the integer multiples of the frequencies are only a ﬁrst
approximation of the theory of lattice oscillations and of the mass ratios of
the particles. The equation of motion in the lattice (4) does not apply in
the eight corners of the cube, nor does it apply to the twelve edges nor, in
particular, to the six sides of the cube. A cube with 109 lattice points is
not correctly described by the periodic boundary condition we have used,
but is what is referred to as a microcrystal. A phenomenological theory of
the frequency distributions in microcrystals, considering in particular surface
waves, can be found in Chapter 6 of Ghatak and Kothari [18]. Surface waves
may account for the small deviations of the mass ratios of the mesons and
baryons from the integer multiple rule of the oscillations in a cube. However,
it seems to be futile to pursue a more accurate determination of the oscillation
frequencies as long as one does not know what the structure of the electron is,
whose mass is 0.378% of the mass of the π0 meson and hence is a substantial
part of the deviation of the mass ratios from the integer multiple rule.

Let us summarize our ﬁndings concerning the particles of the γ-branch.
The π0 meson is the basic mode of the photon lattice oscillations. The
η meson corresponds to the second oscillation mode, as is suggested by m(η)
≈ 4m(π0). The Λ particle corresponds to the superposition of two second

14

modes, as is suggested by m(Λ) ≈ 2m(η). This superposition apparently
results in the creation of spin 1/2. The two modes would then have to be
coupled. The Σ0 and Ξ0 baryons are superpositions of one or two basic modes
on the Λ particle. The Ω− particle corresponds to the superposition of three
coupled second modes as is suggested by m(Ω−) ≈ 3m(η). This procedure
apparently causes spin 3/2. The charmed Λ+
c particle seems to be the ﬁrst
particle incorporating a third oscillation mode. Σ0
c is apparently the super-
position of a negatively charged basic mode on Λ+
c , as is suggested by the
decay of Σ0
c. The easiest explanation of Ξ0
c is that it is the superposition of
two coupled third modes. The superposition of two modes of the same type
is, as in the case of Λ, accompanied by spin 1/2. The Ω0
c baryon is apparently
the superposition of two basic modes on the Ξ0
c particle. All neutral particles
of the γ-branch are thus accounted for. The modes of the particles are listed
in Table 1.

We have also found the γ-branch antiparticles, which follow from the
negative frequencies which solve Eq.(7). Antiparticles have always been as-
sociated with negative energies. Following Dirac’s argument for electrons and
positrons, we associate the masses with the negative frequency distributions
with antiparticles. We emphasize that the existence of antiparticles is an
automatic consequence of our theory.

All particles of the γ-branch are unstable with lifetimes on the order of
10−10 sec or shorter. Born [24] has shown that the oscillations in cubic lattices
held together by central forces are unstable. It seems, however, to be possible
that the particles can be unstable for reasons other than the instability of the
lattice. For example, pair production seems to make it possible to understand
the decay of the π0 meson π0 → e− + e+ + γ (1.198%). Since in our model the
π0 meson consists of a multitude of electromagnetic waves it seems that pair
production takes place within the π0 meson, and even more so in the higher
modes of the γ-branch where the electrons and positrons created by pair
production tend to settle on mesons, as e.g. in η → π+ + π− + π0 (22.6%) or
in the decay η → π+ + π− + γ (4.68%), where the origin of the pair of charges
is more apparent. Pair production is also evident in the decays η → e+e−γ
(0.6%) or η → e+e−e+e− (6.9·10−3%).

Finally we must explain the reason for which the photon lattice or the
γ-branch particles are limited in size to a particular value of about 10−13
cm, as the experiments tell. Conventional lattice theory using the periodic
boundary condition does not limit the size of a crystal, and in fact very large
crystals exist. If, however, the lattice consists of standing electromagnetic

15

waves the size of the lattice is limited by the radiation pressure. The lattice
will necessarily break up at the latest when the outward directed radiation
pressure is equal to the inward directed elastic force which holds the lattice
together. For details we refer to [25].

4 The mass of the π0 meson

So far we have studied the ratios of the masses of the particles. We will now
determine the mass of the π0 meson in order to validate that the mass ratios
link with the actual masses of the particles. The energy of the π0 meson is

E(m(π0)) = 134.9766 MeV = 2.1626 · 10−4 erg.

For the sum of the energies of all frequencies of the lattice in the one-
dimensional case we use the equation

Eν =

f (φ)dφ .

Nhν0
2π

π

Z
−π

(14)

This equation originates from B&K. N is the number of all lattice points.
The total energy of the frequencies in a cubic lattice is equal to the number N
of the oscillations times the average of the energy of the individual frequen-
cies. In order to arrive at an exact value of Eq.(14) we have to use the correct
value of the radius of the proton, which is rp = (0.88 ± 0.015) · 10−13 cm ac-
cording to [23]. With a = 10−16 cm it follows that the number of all lattice
points in the cubic lattice is

N = 2.854 · 109.
The radius of the π± mesons has also been measured [26] and after further
analysis [27] was found to be 0.83 · 10−13 cm, which means that within the
uncertainty of the radii we have rp = rπ. And according to [2] the charge
radius of Σ− is (0.78 ± 0.10) · 10−13 cm.

If the oscillations are parallel to an axis, the limitation of the group
velocity is taken into account, that means if Eq.(13) applies and the absolute
values of the frequencies are taken, then the value of the integral in Eq.(14) is
π2. With N = 2.854 · 109 and ν0 = c⋆/2πa it follows from Eq.(14) that the sum
of the energy of the frequencies corrected for the group velocity limitation
of the basic mode is Ecorr = 1.418·109 erg. That means that the energy is

16

6.56·1012 times larger than E(m(π0)). This discrepancy is inevitable, because
the basic frequency of the Fourier spectrum after a collision on the order of
10−23 sec duration is ν = 1023 sec−1, which means, when E = hν, that one
basic frequency alone contains an energy of about 9m(π0)c2
⋆.

To eliminate this discrepancy we use, instead of the simple form E = hν,
the complete quantum mechanical energy of a linear oscillator as given by
Planck

E =

hν
ehν/kT − 1

.

(15)

This equation was already used by B&K for the determination of the speciﬁc
heat of cubic crystals or solids. Equation (15) calls into question the value of
the temperature T in the interior of a particle. We determine T empirically
with the formula for the internal energy of solids

,

u =

RΘ
eΘ/T − 1
which is from Sommerfeld [28]. In this equation R = 2.854 · 109k, where k is
Boltzmann’s constant, and Θ is the characteristic temperature introduced by
Debye [29] for the explanation of the speciﬁc heat of solids. It is Θ = hνm/k,
where νm is a maximal frequency. In the case of the oscillations making up
the π0 meson the maximal frequency is νm = πν0, therefore νm = 1.5 · 1026
sec−1, and we ﬁnd that Θ = 7.2 · 1015 K.

(16)

In order to determine T we set the internal energy u equal to m(π0)c2
⋆.
It then follows from Eq.(16) that Θ/T = 30.20, or T = 2.38 · 1014 K. That
means that Planck’s formula (15) introduces a factor 1/(eΘ/T − 1 ) ≈ 1/e30.2
= 1/(1.305·1013) into Eq.(14).
In other words, if we determine the tem-
perature T of the particle through Eq.(16), and correct Eq.(14) accordingly
then we arrive at a sum of the oscillation energies of the π0 meson which
is 1.0866·10−4 erg = 67.82 MeV. That means that the sum of the energies
of the one-dimensional oscillations in a cubic lattice consisting of N waves
is 0.502E(m(π0)). We have to double this amount because standing waves
consist of two waves traveling in opposite direction with the same absolute
value of the frequency. The sum of the energy of the lattice oscillations in
the π0 meson is therefore

Eν(π0)(theor) = 2.1732 · 10−4 erg = 135.64 MeV = 1.005E(m(π0))(exp) ,

(17)

17

if the oscillations are parallel to the φ axis. The energy in the mass of the
π0 meson and the energy in the sum of the lattice oscillations agree fairly
well, considering the uncertainties of the parameters involved.

To sum up: We ﬁnd that the energy in the rest mass of the π0 meson
and the other particles of the γ-branch are correctly given by the sum of the
energy of the standing electromagnetic waves, if the energy of the oscilla-
tions is determined by Planck’s formula for the energy of a linear oscillator.
The π0 meson is like an adiabatic, cubic black body ﬁlled with standing elec-
tromagnetic waves. We know from Bose’s work [30] that Planck’s formula
applies to a photon gas as well. For all γ-branch particles we have found
a simple mode of standing waves in a cubic lattice. Since the equation de-
termining the frequency of the standing waves is quadratic it follows auto-
matically that for each positive frequency there is also a negative frequency
of the same absolute value, that means that for each particle there exists
also an antiparticle. For the explanation of the mesons and baryons of the γ-
branch we use only photons, nothing else. A rather conservative explanation
of the π0 meson and the γ-branch particles which does not use hypothetical
particles.

From the frequency distributions of the standing waves in the lattice
follow the ratios of the masses of the particles which obey the integer multiple
rule. It is important to note that in this theory the ratios of the masses of
the γ-branch particles to the mass of the π0 meson do not depend on the
sidelength of the lattice, and the distance between the lattice points, neither
do they depend on the strength of the force between the lattice points nor
on the mass of the lattice points. The mass ratios are determined only by
the spectra of the frequencies of the standing waves in the lattice.

5 The neutrino branch particles

The masses of the neutrino branch, the π±, K±,0, n, D±,0 and D±
s particles, are
integer multiples of the mass of the π± mesons times a factor 0.85 ± 0.02 as we
stated before. We assume, as appears to be quite natural, that the π± mesons
and the other particles of the ν-branch consist of the same particles into
which they decay, that means of neutrinos and antineutrinos and of electrons
or positrons, particles whose existence is unquestionable. Since the particles
of the ν-branch decay through weak decays, we assume, as appears likewise
to be natural, that the weak nuclear force holds the particles of the ν-branch

18

together. The existence of the weak nuclear force is also unquestionable.
Since the range of the weak interaction is only about a thousandth of the
diameter of the particles, the weak force can hold particles together only if
the particles have a lattice structure, just as macroscopic crystals are held
together by microscopic forces between atoms. We will, therefore, investigate
the energy which is contained in the oscillations of a cubic lattice consisting of
electron and muon neutrinos and their antiparticles, and in their rest masses.
It will be necessary to outline the basic aspects of diatomic lattice oscil-
lations. In diatomic lattices the lattice points have alternately the masses m
and M, as with the masses of the electron neutrinos m(νe) and muon neu-
trinos m(νµ). The classic example of a diatomic lattice is the salt crystal
with the masses of the Na and Cl atoms in the lattice points. The theory of
diatomic lattice oscillations was started by Born and v. Karman [13]. They
ﬁrst discussed a diatomic chain. The equation of motions in the chain are
according to Eq.(22) of B&K

where the un are the displacements, n an integer number and α a constant
characterizing the force between the particles. Eqs.(18,19) are solved with

m¨u2n = α(u2n+1 + u2n−1 − 2u2n) ,

M¨u2n+1 = α(u2n+2 + u2n − 2u2n+1) ,

u2n = Aei(ω t + 2nφ),

u2n+1 = Bei(ω t + (2n+1)φ) ,

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

where A and B are constants and φ is given by φ = 2πa/λ as in (6). a is
the lattice constant as before and λ the wavelength, λ = na. The solutions
of Eqs.(20,21) are obviously periodic in time and space and describe again
standing waves. Using (20,21) to solve (18,19) leads to a secular equation
from which according to Eq.(24) of B&K the frequencies of the oscillations
of the chain follow from

4π2ν2

± = α/Mm · ((M + m) ±

(M − m)2 + 4mMcos2φ ) .

6 The masses of the ν-branch particles

The characteristic case of the neutrino branch particles are the π± mesons
which can be created in the process γ + p → π−+π+ + p. A photon impinges
on a proton and is converted in 10−23 sec into a pair of particles of opposite
charge. Fourier analysis dictates that a continuum of frequencies must be in
the collision products. The waves must be standing waves in order to be part
of the rest mass of a particle. The π± mesons decay via π± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ)
(99.98770%) followed by e.g. µ+ → e+ + ¯νµ + νe (≈ 100%). Only µ mesons,
which decay into charge and neutrinos, and neutrinos result from the decay
of the π± mesons.
If the particles consist of the particles into which they
decay, then the π± mesons are made of neutrinos, antineutrinos and e±. Since
neutrinos interact through the weak force which has a range of 10−16 cm
according to p.25 of [22], and since the size of the nucleon is on the order of
10−13 cm, the ν-branch particles must be held together in a cubic lattice. It
is not known with certainty that neutrinos actually have a rest mass as was
originally suggested by Bethe [31] and Bahcall [32] and what the values of
m(νe) and m(νµ) are. However, the results of the Super-Kamiokande [33] and
the Sudbury [34] experiments indicate that the neutrinos have rest masses.
The neutrino lattice must be diatomic, meaning that the lattice points have
alternately larger (m(νµ)) and smaller (m(νe)) masses. We will retain the
traditional term diatomic. The term neutrino lattice will refer to a lattice
consisting of neutrinos and antineutrinos. The lattice we consider is shown
in Fig. 2. Since the neutrinos have spin 1/2 this is a four-Fermion lattice. The
ﬁrst investigation of cubic Fermion lattices in context with the elementary
particles was made by Wilson [12]. A neutrino lattice is electrically neutral.
Since we do not know the structure of the electron we cannot consider lattices
with a charge.

A neutrino lattice takes care of the continuum of frequencies which must,
according to Fourier analysis, be present after the high energy collision which
created the particle. We will, for the sake of simplicity, ﬁrst set the sidelength
of the lattice at 10−13 cm that means approximately equal to the size of the
nucleon. The lattice then contains about 109 lattice points, since the lattice
constant a is on the order of 10−16 cm. The sidelength of the lattice does
not enter Eq.(22) for the frequencies of the lattice oscillations. The calcu-
lation of the ratios of the masses or of the energy of the lattice oscillations
is consequently independent of the size of the lattice, as was the case with
the γ-branch. However the size of the lattice can be explained with the pres-

sure which the lattice oscillations exert on a crossection of the lattice. The
pressure cannot exceed Young’s modulus of the lattice. We require that the
lattice is isotropic.

From the frequency distribution of the axial diatomic oscillations (Eq.22),
shown in Fig. 3, follows the group velocity dω/dk = 2πa dν/dφ at each point
φ. With ν = ν0f (φ) and ν0 =

α/4π2M = c⋆/2πa as in Eq.(9) we ﬁnd

cg = dω/dk = a

α/M · df (φ)/dφ .

(23)

q

q

In order to determine the value of dω/dk we have to know the value of
α/M.
From Eq.(8) for α follows that α = a c44 in the isotropic case with central
forces. The group velocity is therefore

We now set a
follows that

α/M = c⋆ as in Eq.(11), where c⋆ is the velocity of light. It

(25)

as it was with the γ-branch, only that now on account of the rest masses of the
neutrinos the group velocity must be smaller than c⋆, so the value of df/dφ
∼= c⋆, which is a necessity because the neutrinos in
is limited to < 1, but cg

the lattice soon approach the velocity of light as we will see. Equation (25)
applies regardless whether we consider ν+ or ν− in Eq.(22). That means that
there are no separate transverse oscillations with their theoretically higher
frequencies.

From Eq.(24) one can determine the rest mass M with lattice theory,
as we have shown in [11]. We will, however, soon determine the rest mass
of the muon neutrino with Eq.(26), which leads to m(νµ) ≈ 50 meV/c2
⋆. It
can be veriﬁed easily that m(νµ) = 50 meV/c2
⋆ makes sense. The energy of
the rest mass of the π± mesons is 139 MeV, and we have N/4 = 0.7135·109
muon neutrinos and the same number of anti-muon neutrinos. It then follows
that the energy in the rest masses of all muon and anti-muon neutrinos is
71.35 MeV, that is 51% of the energy of the rest mass of the π± mesons,
m(π±)c2
⋆ goes, as we will see, into
the electron neutrino masses, the rest goes into the lattice oscillations.

⋆ = 139.57 MeV. A small part of m(π±)c2

22

We can now determine the rest mass of the π± mesons from the sum of the
oscillation energies and the sum of the rest masses of the neutrinos. For the
sum of the energies of the frequencies we use Eq.(14) with the same N and ν0
we used for the γ-branch. For the integral in Eq.(14) of the corrected axial
diatomic frequencies we ﬁnd the value π2/2 as can be easily derived from the
plot of the corrected frequencies in Fig. 3. The value of the integral in Eq.(14)
for the axial diatomic frequencies ν = ν0φ is 1/2 of the value 2π3 of the same
integral in the case of axial monatomic frequencies, because in the latter case
the increase of the corrected frequencies continues to φ1 = π, whereas in the
diatomic case the increase of the corrected frequencies ends at π/2, see Fig. 3.
We consider cg to be so close to c⋆ that it does not change the value of the
integral in Eq.(14) signiﬁcantly. It can be calculated that the time average
of the velocity of the electron neutrinos in the π± mesons is ¯v = 0.99994c⋆,
if m(νe) = 0.365 meV/c2
⋆ as will be shown in Eq.(31). Consequently we ﬁnd
that the sum of the energies of the corrected diatomic neutrino frequencies is
0.5433·10−4 erg = 33.91 MeV. We double this amount because we deal with
the superposition of two waves of the same energy and ﬁnd that the energy of
the neutrino oscillations Eν(π±) is 67.82 MeV = 1/2·Eν(π0) or 0.486m(π±)c2.
With the help of Eν(π±) we obtain an approximate value of the rest mass

of the muon neutrino, because

m(π±)c2

⋆ − Eν(π±) =

[m(νµ) + m(¯νµ) + m(νe) + m(¯νe)]c2

⋆ = 71.75 MeV .
(26)
If m(νe) ≪ m(νµ) and m(νµ) = m(¯νµ), as we will justify later, we arrive with
N/2 = 1.427·109 at

X

m(νµ) ≈ 50 meV/c2
⋆.
The sum of the energy of the rest masses of all neutrinos plus the oscilla-
tion energy, or the theoretical rest mass of the π± mesons, is then of course
139.57 MeV.

A cubic lattice and conservation of neutrino numbers necessitates that the
lattice contains just as many electron neutrinos as anti-electron neutrinos.
However, in the decay sequence of (say) the π− meson π− → µ− + ¯νµ and
µ− → e− + νµ + ¯νe an electron neutrino does not appear. But since N/4
electron neutrinos νe must be in the π− lattice N/4 electron neutrinos must go
with the electron emitted in the µ− decay. Whether or not this interpretation
is correct can be decided only after the explanation of the structure of the
electron.

The antiparticle of the π+ meson is the particle in which all frequencies of

23

the neutrino lattice oscillations have been replaced by frequencies with the
opposite sign, all neutrinos replaced by their antiparticles and the positive
charge replaced by the negative charge. If, as we will show, the antineutrinos
have the same rest mass as the neutrinos it follows that the antiparticle of the
π+ meson has the same mass as π+ but opposite charge, i.e. is the π− meson.
The primary decay of the K± mesons K± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ) (63.5%), leads to
the same end products as the π± meson decay π± → µ± + νµ(¯νµ). From this
and the composition of the µ mesons we learn that the K mesons must, at least
partially, be made of the same four neutrino types as in the π± mesons namely
of muon neutrinos, anti-muon neutrinos, electron neutrinos and anti-electron
neutrinos and their oscillation energies. However the K± mesons cannot be
solely the second mode of the lattice oscillations of the π± mesons, because
the second mode of the π± mesons has an energy of 4Eν(π±) + N/2·(m(νµ)
+ m(νe)) c2
⋆ ≈ (271.3 + 71.75)MeV = 343 MeV. The 343 MeV characterize
the second or (2.) mode of the π± mesons, which fails m(K±)c2
⋆ = 493.7 MeV
by a wide margin.

Anyway, the concept of the K± mesons being alone a higher mode of the
π± mesons contradicts our point that the particles consist of the particles
into which they decay. The decays K± → π± + π0 (21.13%), as well as K+
→ π0 + e+ + νe (4.87%), called K+
e3, and K+ → π0 + µ+ + νµ (3.27%), called
K+
µ3, make up 29.27% of the K± meson decays. A π0 meson ﬁgures in each
of these decays. If we add the energy in the rest mass of a π0 meson m(π0)c2
⋆
= 134.97 MeV to the 343 MeV in the second mode of the π± mesons then we
arrive at an energy of 478 MeV, which is 96.8% of m(K±)c2
⋆. Therefore we
conclude that the K± mesons consist of the second mode of the π± mesons
plus a π0 meson or are the state (2.)π± + π0. Then it is natural that π0 mesons
from the π0 component in the K± mesons are among the decay products of
the K± mesons.

We obtain the K0 meson if we superpose onto the second mode of the
π± mesons instead of a π0 meson a basic mode of the π± mesons with a charge
opposite to the charge of the second mode of the π± meson. The K0 and
K0 mesons, or the state (2.)π± + π∓, is made of neutrinos and antineutrinos
only, without a photon component, because the second mode of π± as well
as the basic mode π∓ consist of neutrinos and antineutrinos only. Since the
mass of a π± meson is by 4.59 MeV/c2
⋆ larger than the mass of a π0 meson
the mass of K0 should be larger than m(K±), and indeed m(K0) − m(K±) =
⋆ according to [2]. Similar diﬀerences occur with m(D±) − m(D0)

π+ and π− mesons which are part of the (2.)π± + π∓ structure of K0 we have
suggested. The decay K0
S → π0 + π0 (31.4%) apparently originates from the
2γ branch of electron positron annihilation. Both decays account for 100%
of the decays of K0
L → 3π0 (21.1%) apparently comes from
the 3γ branch of electron positron annihilation. The two decays of K0
L called
e3 into π± e∓ νe (38.79%) which together
K0
make up 65.95% of the K0
L decays apparently originate from the decay of
the second mode of the π± mesons in the K0 structure, either into µ∓ + νµ
or into e∓ + νe. The same types of decay, apparently tied to the (2.)π±
mode, accompany also the K± decays where, however, a π0 meson replaces
the π± mesons in the K0
L decays. Our rule that the particles consist of the
particles into which they decay also holds for the K0 and K0 mesons.

The neutron with a mass ≈ 2m(K±) is either the superposition of a K+
and a K− meson or of a K0 meson and a K0 meson. However, as we will
see, the spin rules out a neutron consisting of a K+ and a K− meson. On
the other hand, the neutron can consist of a K0 and a K0 meson.
In this
case the neutron lattice contains at each lattice point a νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrino
quadrupole plus the second mode of the lattice oscillations and a quadrupole
of positive and negative electrical charges. The lattice oscillations in the
neutron must be coupled in order for the neutron to have spin 1/2, just
as the Λ baryon with spin 1/2 is a superposition of two η mesons. With
m(K0)(theor) = m(K±) + 4 MeV/c2 = 482 MeV/c2
⋆ from above it follows
that m(n)(theor) ≈ 2m(K0)(theor) ≈ 964 MeV/c2

⋆ = 1.026m(n)(exp).

The proton does not decay and does not tell which particles it is made
of. However we learn about the structure of the proton through the decay
of the neutron n → p + e− + ¯νe (100%). One single anti-electron neutrino
is emitted when the neutron decays and 1.293 MeV are released. But there
is no place for a permanent vacancy of a single missing neutrino and for a
small amount of permanently missing oscillation energy in a nuclear lattice.
As it appears all anti-electron neutrinos are removed from the structure of
the neutron in the neutron decay and converted into the kinetic energy of the
decay products. This type of process will be discussed again in the following
section. On the other hand, it seems to be certain that the proton consists
of a neutrino lattice carrying a net positive electric charge. Actually, in our
model the proton contains three charges e+e−e+. Each charge has a magnetic
moment, all of them point in the same direction because the spin of the one
e− must be opposite to the spin of the two e+. Each magnetic moment of the
electric charges has a g-factor ∼= 2. All three electric charges in the proton

25

must then have a g-factor ≈ 6, whereas the measured g(p) = 5.585 = 0.93·6.
In the same way we can explain the magnetic moment of the neutron
which has a magnetic moment with a g-factor g(n) = - 3.826 = - 0.956·4.
This magnetic moment must originate from a pair of electric charges since
the g-factor of a single electric charge is ∼= 1.00116·2. At least two electric
charges of opposite sign must be within the neutron to have any magnetic
moment at all. However, in the standing wave model four charges are in the
In order to have a magnetic moment

twice the moment of either e+ or e− the spin of two charges must be parallel,
whereas the spin of the two other charges must be antiparallel so that their
magnetic moments cancel, or there must be two opposite charges with op-
posite spin. As discussed in the preceding paragraph the magnetic moment
of the proton is caused by the parallel spin of two e+ and the opposite spin
of one e−, causing a moment three times the moment of one charge. These
three charges carry N/4 electron neutrinos each, because all anti-electron
neutrinos have been removed from the neutron lattice in its decay, as men-
tioned before. As follows from the decay n → p + e− + ¯νe there must be an
additional e− in the neutron as compared to the proton. The additional e−
carries N/4 anti-electron neutrinos because of conservation of angular mo-
mentum. Consequently this electron has a spin opposite to the spin of the
e− in the proton. The magnetic moments of the two electrons with opposite
spin cancel. However two positive charges e+ having the same spin are also
in the neutron, as they are in the proton. They create the magnetic moment
of the neutron and have a g-factor ∼= 4.

There seems to be an excess angular momentum caused by the parallel
spin of the two e+. However this is taken care of by the spin of the anti-
electron neutrino which comes with the neutron decay and by the spin of
the N/4 electron neutrinos not bound in the electric charges in the neutron.
Summing up, the magnetic moment of the neutron is caused by the parallel
spin of a pair of the four electrical charges which are in the neutron according
to our model. The magnetic moment of the other pair of charges cancel
because their spin is antiparallel.

The D± mesons are the superposition of a proton and an antineutron of
opposite spin or of their antiparticles, whereas the superposition of a proton
and a neutron with the same spin creates the deuteron with spin 1 and a mass
m(d) = 0.9988·(m(p) + m(n)). In this case the proton and neutron interact
with the strong force, nevertheless the deuteron consists of a neutrino lattice
with standing waves. The D±
s mesons seem to be made of a body centered

26

cubic lattice as discussed in [35].

The average factor 0.85 ± 0.025 in the ratios of the particles of the ν-
branch to the π± mesons is a consequence of the neutrino rest masses. They
make it impossible that the ratios of the particle masses are integer multiples
because the particles consist of the energy in the neutrino oscillations plus
the neutrino rest masses which are independent of the order of the lattice
oscillations. Since the contribution in percent of the neutrino rest masses
to the ν-branch particle masses decreases with increased particle mass the
factor in front of the mass ratios of the ν-branch particles must decrease with
increased particle mass.

Summing up: The characteristic feature of the ν-branch particles is the
cubic lattice consisting of νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos. The rest mass of the ν-
branch particles comes from the sum of the rest masses of the neutrinos and
from the energy in the lattice oscillations. The existence of the neutrino
lattice is a necessity if one wants to explain the spin, or the absence of spin,
of the ν-branch particles.

7 The rest masses of the leptons

Surprisingly one can also explain the mass of the µ± mesons with the stand-
ing wave model. The µ mesons are part of the lepton family which is distin-
guished from the mesons and baryons by the absence of strong interaction
with the mesons and baryons. The leptons make up 1/2 of the number of
stable elementary particles. The standard model of the particles does not
deal with the leptons. Barut [36] has given a simple and quite accurate
empirical formula relating the masses of the electron, µ meson and τ meson,
which formula has been extended by Gsponer and Hurni [37] to the quark
masses.

The mass of the µ mesons is m(µ±) = 105.658357 ± 5·10−6 MeV/c2
⋆, ac-
cording to the Review of Particle Physics [2]. The mass of the µ mesons is
usually compared to the mass of the electron and is often said to be m(µ)
= m(e)(1 + 3/2αf ) = 206.554 m(e), (αf being the ﬁne structure constant),
whereas the experimental value is 206.768 m(e). The µ mesons are “stable”,
their lifetime is τ (µ±) = 2.19703 · 10−6 ± 4 · 10−11 sec, about a hundred times
longer than the lifetime of the π± mesons, that means longer than the lifetime
of any other elementary particle, but for the electrons, protons and neutrons.
Comparing the mass of the µ mesons to the mass of the π± mesons m(π±)

27

⋆ we ﬁnd that m(µ±)/m(π±) = 0.757027 = 1.00937 · 3/4
= 139.57018 MeV/c2
or that that the mass of the µ± mesons is in a good approximation 3/4 of
the mass of the π± mesons. We have also m(π±) − m(µ±) = 33.9118 MeV/c2
⋆
= 0.24297m(π±) or approximately 1/4 · m(π±). The mass of the electron is
approximately 1/206 of the mass of the muon, the contribution of m(e±) to
m(µ±) will therefore be neglected in the following. We assume, as we have
done before and as appears to be natural, that the particles, including the
muons, consist of the particles into which they decay. The µ+ meson decays
via µ+ → e+ + ¯νµ + νe (≈ 100%). The muons are apparently composed of
some of the neutrinos, antineutrinos and their oscillations which are present
in the cubic neutrino lattice of the π± mesons according to our standing wave
model.

In the standing wave model the π± mesons are composed of a cubic lattice
consisting of N/4 = 0.7135 · 109 muon neutrinos νµ and the same number of
anti-muon neutrinos ¯νµ, as well as of N/4 electron neutrinos νe and the same
number of anti-electron neutrinos ¯νe, plus the oscillation energy of these
neutrinos. Eq.(26) said that the rest mass of a muon neutrino should be
about 50 milli-eV/c2
⋆, provided that the mass of an electron neutrino is small
as compared to m(νµ). With N = 2.854·109 we ﬁnd that:

(a) The diﬀerence of the rest masses of the µ± and π± mesons is nearly
equal to the sum of the rest masses of all muon, respectively anti-muon,
neutrinos in the π± mesons.

m(π±) − m(µ±) = 33.912 MeV/c2
⋆

versus N/4 · m(νµ) = 35.68 MeV/c2
⋆ .

(b) The energy in the oscillations of all νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos in the
π± mesons is nearly the same as the energy in the oscillations of all ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe,
respectively νµ, νe, ¯νe, neutrinos in the µ± mesons. The oscillation energy is
the rest mass of a particle minus the sum of the rest masses of all neutrinos
in the particle as in Eq.(26). So

Eν(π±) = m(π±)c2

⋆ − N/2 · [m(νµ) + m(νe)]c2

⋆ = 68.22 MeV

(27)

versus

Eν(µ±) = m(µ±)c2

⋆ − N/4 · m(¯νµ)c2

⋆ − N/2 · m(νe)c2

⋆ = 69.98 MeV .

(28)

(a) seems to say that the energy of the rest masses of all muon (respectively
anti-muon) neutrinos of the lattice is consumed in the π± decay. We attribute

28

the 1.768 MeV diﬀerence between the left and right side of (a) to the second
order eﬀects which cause the deviations of the masses of the particles from
the integer multiple rule. There is also the diﬀerence that the left side of (a)
deals with two charged particles, whereas the right side deals with neutral
particles. (b) seems to say that the oscillation energy of all neutrinos in the
π± lattice is conserved in the π± decay, which seems to be necessary because
the oscillation frequencies in π± and µ± must follow Eq.(13) as dictated by
the group velocity limitation. If indeed Eν(π±) = Eν(µ±) then it follows from
the diﬀerence of Eqs.(27) and (28) that m(π±) − m(µ±) = N/4·m(νµ).

We should note that in the π± decays only one single muon neutrino is
emitted, not N/4 of them, but that in the π± decay 33.9 MeV are released.
Since according to (b) the oscillation energy of the neutrinos in the π± mesons
is conserved in the π± decay the 33.9 MeV released in the π± decay can come
from no other source then from the rest masses of N/4 − 1 ∼= N/4 muon
neutrinos in the π± mesons. The energy in the rest masses of these muon
neutrinos is used to supply the kinetic energy in the momentum of the single
emitted muon neutrino (pc⋆ = 30 MeV) and in the momentum of the emitted
µ meson (pc⋆ = 4 MeV).

Inserting m(π±) − m(µ±) = N/4·m(νµ) from (a) into Eq.(27) we arrive at

an equation for the theoretical value of the mass of the µ± mesons. It is

m(µ±)c2

⋆ = 1/2 · [ Eν(π±) + m(π±)c2

⋆ + Nm(νe)c2

⋆/2 ] = 103.95 MeV ,

(29)

which expresses m(µ±) through the well-known mass of π±, the calculated
oscillation energy of π±, and a small contribution (0.4%) of the electron
neutrino masses. A diﬀerent form of this equation is, with Eν(π±) = Eν(µ±),

m(µ+) = Eν(µ±)/c2

⋆ + Nm(νµ)/4 + N[ m(νe) + m(¯νe) ]/4 .

(30)

Eq.(29) shows that our explanation of the mass of the µ± mesons comes close
to the experimental value m(µ±) = 105.658 MeV/c2.

Our model of the µ± mesons means that the neutrino lattice of the µ me-
sons has the same size as the cubic lattice of the π± mesons, namely 0.88·10−13
cm diameter. This contradicts the commonly held belief that the µ mesons
are point particles. However, since in our model the µ mesons consist of a
neutrino lattice plus an electric charge and since neutrinos do not interact,
in a good approximation, with neither charge nor mass it will not be possible
to determine the size of the µ meson lattice through conventional scattering
experiments. Therefore the µ mesons will appear to be point particles.

29

Finally we must address the question for what reason do the muons or
leptons not interact strongly with the mesons and baryons? We have shown
in [8] that a strong force emanates from the sides of a cubic lattice caused by
the unsaturated weak forces of about 106 lattice points at the surface of the
lattice of the mesons and baryons. This follows from the study of Born and
Stern [38] which dealt with the forces between two parts of a cubic lattice
If the muons have a lattice consisting of one type of
cleaved in vacuum.
muon neutrinos, say, ¯νµ and of νe and ¯νe neutrinos their octahedronal lattice
surface is not the same as the surface of the cubic νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe lattice of the
mesons and baryons in the standing wave model. Therefore the muon lattice
does not bond with the cubic lattice of the mesons and baryons.

To summarize what we have learned about the µ± mesons. Eq.(30) says
that the energy in m(µ±)c2 is the sum of the oscillation energy plus the sum
of the energy of the rest masses of the neutrinos in m(µ±). The three neutrino
types in the µ± mesons are the remains of the cubic neutrino lattice in the
π± mesons. Since all νµ respectively all ¯νµ neutrinos have been removed from
the π± lattice in the π± decay the rest mass of the µ± mesons must be ∼=
3/4·m(π±) as the experiments found. The µ± mesons are not point particles
s mesons. It
can be shown readily that the oscillation energies of the lattices in D±
s and
in τ ± are the same. From that follows that the energy in the rest mass of the
τ ± mesons is the sum of the oscillation energy in the τ meson lattice plus the
sum of the energy of the rest masses of all neutrinos in the τ meson lattice,
just as with the µ± mesons. We will skip the details. The tau mesons are
not point particles either.

The mass of the τ ± mesons follows from the decay of the D±

If the same principle that applies to the decay of the π± mesons, namely
that in the decay an entire neutrino type supplies the energy released in the
decay, also applies to the decay of the neutron n → p+e− + ¯νe, then the mass
of the anti-electron neutrino can be determined from the known diﬀerence
∆ = m(n) − m(p) = 1.293332 MeV/c2
⋆. Nearly one half of ∆ comes from the
energy lost by the emission of the electron, whose mass is 0.510999 MeV/c2
⋆.
N anti-electron neutrinos are in the neutron, one-fourth of them is carried
away by the emitted electron. We have seen in the paragraph below Eq.(26)
that the decay sequence of the π± mesons requires that the electron carries
with it N/4 electron neutrinos, if the π± mesons consist of a lattice of equal
numbers of νe, ¯νe, νµ, ¯νµ neutrinos. The electron can also carry N/4 anti-
electron neutrinos as well. Since, as we will see shortly, m(νe) = m(¯νe)
this does not make a diﬀerence energetically. The other 3/4·N anti-electron

30

neutrinos provide the energy ∆ − m(e−)c2
⋆ = 0.782321 MeV released in the
decay of the neutron. After division by 3/4·N, it follows that the rest mass
of the anti-electron neutrino is

Since theoretically the antineutron decays as ¯n → ¯p + e+ + νe it follows from
the same considerations as with the decay of the neutron that

m(¯νe) = 0.365 meV/c2
⋆ .

m(νe) = m(¯νe) .

We note that

N/4 · m(νe) = N/4 · m(¯νe) = 0.51 m(e±) .

Inserting (32) into Eq.(26) it follows that

m(νµ) = 49.91 meV/c2
⋆ ,
Since the same considerations apply for either the π+ or the π− meson it
follows that

(34)

(35)

m(νµ) = m(¯νµ) .
The mass of the τ neutrino can be determined from the decay D±
s →
τ ± + ντ (¯ντ ), and the subsequent decay τ ± → π± + ¯ντ (ντ ), as discussed in
[35]. The appearance of the τ meson in the decay of D±
s and the presence of
νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos in the π± decay product of the τ ± mesons means that
there must be ντ , ¯ντ , νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe neutrinos in the D±
s lattice. The additional
ντ and ¯ντ neutrinos can be accomodated in the D±
s lattice by a body-centered
cubic lattice, in which there is in the center of each cubic cell one particle
diﬀerent from the particles in the eight cell corners. In a body-centered cubic
lattice there are N/4 cell centers, if N is the number of lattice points without
the centers. If the center particles are tau neutrinos there must be N/8 ντ
and N/8 ¯ντ neutrinos, because of conservation of neutrino numbers. From
⋆ and m(τ ±) = 1777 MeV/c2
m(D±

s ) = 1968.5 MeV/c2

⋆ follows that

m(D±

s ) − m(τ ±) = 191.5 MeV/c2

⋆ = N/8 · m(ντ ) .

The rest mass of the τ neutrinos is therefore

(37)

m(ντ ) = m(¯ντ ) = 0.537 eV/c2

31

We can now explain the ratio m(µ±)/m(e±) as well as m(π±)/m(e±) and

m(p)/m(e−). From Eqs.(31,34) we ﬁnd that

m(νµ)/m(νe) = 136.74 ,

(38)

which is 99.8% of the inverse of the ﬁne structure constant αf = 1/137.036.
It does not seem likely that this is just a coincidence. We set N/4·m(νe)
= 0.5 m(e±), not at 0.51 m(e±) as in Eq.(33). Then m(e±) = N/2·m(νe)
or N/2·m(¯νe). We also set Eν(π±) = 0.5 m(π±)c2, not at 0.486 m(π±)c2 as
above Eq.(26). With Eν(π±) = Eν(µ±) from (b) it follows that Eν(µ±) =
N/2·[m(νµ) + m(νe)]. From Eq.(30) then follows that

m(µ±) = 3/4 · Nm(νµ) + Nm(νe) ,

and with m(e±) = N/2·m(νe) we have

m(νµ)

In order to determine m(n)/m(e±) we start with K0 = (2.)π± + π∓ and

To summarize what we have learned about the masses of the leptons: We
have found an explanation for the mass of the µ± mesons and τ ± mesons.
We have also determined the rest masses of the e, µ, τ neutrinos. In other
words, we have found the masses of all leptons, exempting the electron, a
topic which we will deal with later.

8 The spin of the γ-branch particles

It appears to be crucial for the validity of a model of the elementary particles
that the model can also explain the spin of the particles without additional
assumptions. The spin or the intrinsic angular momentum is, after the mass,
the second most important property of the elementary particles. As is well-
known the spin of the electron was discovered by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit
[39] more than 75 years ago. Later on it was established that the baryons
have spin as well, but not the mesons. We have proposed an explanation of
the spin of the particles in [40]. For current eﬀorts to understand the spin
of the nucleon see Jaﬀe [41] and of the spin structure of the Λ baryon see
[42]. The explanation of the spin requires an unambiguous
G¨ockeler et al.
answer, the spin must be 0 or 1/2 or integer multiples thereof, nothing else.
The spin of the particles is, of course, the sum of the angular momentum
vectors of the oscillations plus the sum of the spin vectors of the neutrinos,
antineutrinos and the electric charges in the cubic lattice of the mesons and
baryons. It is striking that the particles which, according to the standing
wave model, consist of a single oscillation mode do not have spin, as the
π0, π± and η mesons do, see Tables 1 and 2. It is also striking that particles
whose mass is approximately twice the mass of a smaller particle have spin
1/2 as is the case with the Λ baryon, m(Λ) ≈ 2m(η), and with the nucleon
m(n) ≈ 2m(K±) ≈ 2m(K0). The Ξ0
c baryon which is a doublet of one mode
has also spin 1/2. Composite particles which consist of a doublet of one
mode plus one or two other single modes have spin 1/2, as the Σ0, Ξ0 and
Λ+
c baryons do. The only particle which seems to be the triplet of a

c , Σ0

c, Ω0

33

single mode, the Ω− baryon with m(Ω−) ≈ 3m(η), has spin 3/2. It appears
that the relation between the spin and the oscillation modes of the particles
is straightforward.

In the standing wave model the π0 and η mesons consist of N = 2.85·109
standing electromagnetic waves, each with its own frequency. Their lattice
oscillations are longitudinal. The longitudinal oscillations of frequency νi in
the π0 and η mesons do not have angular momentum or
i j(νi) = 0, with
the index running from 0 to N. Longitudinal lattice oscillations cannot cause
an intrinsic angular momentum because for longitudinal oscillations ~r × ~p =
0.

P

Each of the standing waves in the π0 and η mesons may, on the other
hand, have spin s = 1 of its own, because circularly polarized electromag-
netic waves have an angular momentum as was ﬁrst suggested by Poynting
[43] and veriﬁed by, among others, Allen [44]. The creation of the π0 meson
in the reaction γ + p → π0 + p and conservation of angular momentum
dictates that the sum of the angular momentum vectors of the N electro-
magnetic waves in the π0 meson is zero,
i j(si) = 0. Either the sum of the
spin vectors of the electromagnetic waves in the π0 meson is zero, or each
electromagnetic wave in the π0 meson has zero spin. That would mean that
they are linearly polarized. Linearly polarized electromagnetic waves are not
expected to have angular momentum. That this is actually so was proven by
Allen [44]. Since the longitudinal lattice oscillations in the π0 and η mesons
do not have angular momentum and since the sum of the spin vectors si of
the electromagnetic waves must be zero, the intrinsic angular momentum of
the π0 and η mesons is zero, or

P

j(νi) +

j(si) = 0 (0 ≤ i ≤ N) .

(45)

Xi

Xi

In the standing wave model the π0 and η mesons do not have an intrinsic
angular momentum or spin, as it must be.

We now consider particles such as the Λ baryon which consist of super-
positions of two oscillations of equal amplitudes, of frequencies ω and − ω,
|− ω| = ω, shifted in phase by π at each of the N points of the lattice. The
oscillations in the particles are coupled what we have marked in Tables 1,2
by the · sign. These particles contain N circular oscillations, each with its
own frequency and each having an angular momentum of ¯h/2 as we will see.
The superposition of two perpendicular linearly polarized traveling waves
of equal amplitudes and frequencies shifted in phase by π/2 leads to a cir-

34

with the moment of inertia Θ. It follows that the angular momentum j is

This applies to a traveling wave and corresponds to spin s = 1, or to a
circularly polarized electromagnetic wave.

We now add to one monochromatic oscillation with frequency ω a second
oscillation with − ω of the same absolute value as ω but shifted in phase by
π, having the same amplitude, as we have done in [40]. Negative frequencies
are permitted solutions of the equations for the lattice oscillations. In other
words we consider the perpendicular oscillations

x(t) = exp[iωt] + exp[− i(ωt + π)] ,

y(t) = exp[i(ωt + π/2)] + exp[− i(ωt + 3π/2)] .

This can also be written as

x(t) = exp[iωt] − exp[−iωt] ,

y(t) = i · (exp[iωt] + exp[−iωt]) .

If we replace i in the Eqs. above by − i we have a circular oscillation turning
in opposite direction. The energy of the superposition of the two oscillations
is the sum of the energies of both individual oscillations, so according to
Eq.(47) we have

4Ekin = 4Θω2/2 = Etot = ¯hω ,

(53)

from which follows that the circular oscillation has an angular momentum

The superposition of two perpendicular monochromatic oscillations of equal
amplitudes and frequencies satisﬁes the necessary condition for spin s = 1/2
that the angular momentum is j = ¯h/2.

The standing wave model treats the Λ baryon, which has spin s = 1/2
and a mass m(Λ) = 1.0190 · 2m(η), as the superposition of two particles
of the same type with N standing electromagnetic waves. The waves are
circular because they are the superposition of two perpendicular waves with
the same absolute value of the frequency and the same amplitude. The
angular momentum vectors of all circular waves in the lattice cancel, except
for the wave at the center of the crystal. Each oscillation with frequency ω at
φ > 0 has at its mirror position φ < 0 a wave with the frequency − ω, which
has a negative angular momentum since j = mr2ω. Consequently the angular
momentum vectors of both waves cancel. The center of the lattice oscillates,
as all other lattice points do, but not with the frequency ν(0) that follows
from Eq.(13) because this equation deals with a lattice of inﬁnite extent.
Rather ν(0) is determined by the longest possible wavelength, which is twice
the diameter d of the lattice, so ν(0) = c/2d. As the other circular waves
in the lattice the circular wave at the center has the angular momentum
¯h/2 according to Eq.(54). The angular momentum of the center wave is the
only angular momentum which is not canceled by an oscillation of opposite
circulation.

Consequently the net angular momentum of the N circular oscillations in
the lattice which are superpositions of two oscillations reduces to the angular
momentum of the center oscillation and is ¯h/2. Since the circular lattice
oscillations in the Λ baryon are the only possible contribution to an angular
momentum the intrinsic angular momentum of the Λ baryon is ¯h/2 or

j(Λ) =

j(νi) = j(ν0) = ¯h/2 .

(55)

Xi

We have thus explained that the Λ and likewise the Ξ0
c baryon satisfy the nec-
essary condition that j = ¯h/2 for s = 1/2. The intrinsic angular momentum
of the Λ baryon is the consequence of the superposition of two perpendicular
oscillations of the same amplitude and frequency.

The other particles of the γ-branch, the Σ0, Ξ0, Λ+

c baryons
are composites of a baryon with spin 1/2 plus one or two π mesons which do

c and Ω0

not have spin. Consequently the spin of these particles is 1/2. The spin of
all particles of the γ-branch, exempting the spin of the Ω− baryon, has thus
been explained. For an explanation of s(Σ±,0) = 1/2 and of s(Ξ−,0) = 1/2,
regardless whether the particles are charged or neutral, we refer to [40].

9 The spin of the particles of the ν-branch

The characteristic particles of the neutrino-branch are the π± mesons which
have zero spin. At ﬁrst glance it seems to be odd that the π± mesons do not
have spin, because it seems that the π± mesons should have spin 1/2 from
the spin of the charges e± in π±. However that is not the case. The solution
of this puzzle is in the composition of the π± mesons which are, according to
the standing wave model, made of a lattice of neutrinos and antineutrinos
(Fig. 2), each having spin 1/2.

In a cubic lattice of N neutrinos and antineutrinos the spin of nearly
all neutrinos and antineutrinos must cancel because conservation of angular
momentum during the creation of the particle requires that the total angular
momentum around a central axis is ¯h/2. In fact the spin vectors of all but
the neutrino or antineutrino in the center of the lattice cancel. In order for
this to be so the spin vector of any particular neutrino in the lattice has to be
opposite to spin vector of the neutrino at its mirror position. As is well-known
only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos exist. From ν =
ν0φ (Eq.13) follows that the direction of motion of the neutrinos in e.g. the
upper right quadrant (φ > 0) is opposite to the direction of motion in the
lower left quadrant (φ < 0). Consequently the spin vectors of all neutrinos
or antineutrinos in opposite quadrants are opposite and cancel. The only
angular momentum remaining from the spin of the neutrinos of the lattice is
the angular momentum of the neutrino or antineutrino at the center of the
lattice which does not have a mirror particle. Consequently the electrically
neutral neutrino lattice consisting of N/2 neutrinos and N/2 antineutrinos,
i j(ni)
each with spin s(ni) = 1/2, has an intrinsic angular momentum j =
= j(n0) = ¯h/2.

P

The longitudinal oscillations in the neutrino lattice of the π± mesons do
i j(νi) = 0. But electrons or positrons
not cause an angular momentum,
added to the neutral neutrino lattice have spin 1/2. If the spin of the electron
or positron added to the neutrino lattice is opposite to the spin of the neutrino
or antineutrino in the center of the lattice then the net spin of the π+ or π−

mesons is zero, or

j(π±) =

j(ni) + j(e±) = j(n0) + j(e±) = 0

(0 ≤ i ≤ N) .

(56)

It is important for the understanding of the structure of the π± mesons to
realize that s(π±) = 0 can only be explained if the π± mesons consist of
a neutrino lattice to which an electron or positron is added whose spin is
opposite to the net spin of the neutrino lattice. Spin 1/2 of the electric
charges can only be canceled by something that has also spin 1/2, and the
only conventional choice for that is a single neutrino.

The spin, the mass and the decay of π± require that the π± mesons are

made of a neutrino lattice and an electrical charge.

The spin of the K± mesons is zero. With the spin of the K± mesons
we encounter the same oddity we have just observed with the spin of the
π± mesons, namely we have a particle which carries an electrical charge with
spin 1/2, and nevertheless the particle does not have spin. The explanation
of s(K±) = 0 follows the same lines as the explanation of the spin of the
π± mesons. In the standing wave model the K± mesons are described by the
state (2.)π± + π0, that means by the second mode of the π± mesons plus
a π0 meson. The second mode of the longitudinal oscillations of a neutral
i j(νi)
neutrino lattice does not have a net intrinsic angular momentum
= 0. But the spin of the neutrinos contributes an angular momentum ¯h/2,
which originates from the neutrino or antineutrino in the center of the lattice,
just as it is with the neutrino lattice in the π± mesons, so
i j(ni) = ¯h/2.
Adding an electric charge with a spin opposite to the net intrinsic angular
momentum of the neutrino lattice oscillations creates the charged (2.)π±
mode which has zero spin

P

P

j((2.)π±) =

j(ni) + j(e±) = j(n0) + j(e±) = 0 .

(57)

Xi

As discussed in Section 6 it is necessary to add a π0 meson to the second mode
of the π± meson in order to obtain the correct mass and the correct decays
of the K± mesons. Since the π0 meson does not have spin the addition of the
π0 meson does not add to the intrinsic angular momentum of the K± mesons.
So s(K±) = 0 as it must be.

The explanation of s = 0 of the K0 and K0 mesons described by the state
(2.)π± + π∓ is diﬀerent. The oscillations of the second mode of π± as well
as of the basic π∓ mode do not create an angular momentum,
i j(νi) =

38

P

0. The second mode of the π± mesons, or the (2.)π± state, and the basic
π∓ mode each have N/2 neutrinos and N/2 antineutrinos, so the number
of all neutrinos and antineutrinos in the sum of both states, the K0 meson,
is 2N. Since the size of the lattice of the K± mesons and the K0 mesons is
the same it follows that two neutrinos are at each lattice point of the K0 or
K0 mesons. We assume that Pauli’s exclusion principle applies for neutrinos
as well. Consequently each neutrino at each lattice point must share its
location with an antineutrino. That means that the contribution of the spin
of all neutrinos and antineutrinos to the intrinsic angular momentum of the
K0 meson is zero or
i j(2ni) = 0. The sum of the spin vectors of the two
opposite charges in the K0 and K0 mesons, or in the (2.)π± + π∓ state, is
also zero. Since neither the lattice oscillations nor the spin of the neutrinos
and antineutrinos nor the electric charges contribute an angular momentum

P

j(K 0) =

j(2ni) + j(e+ + e−) = 0 .

(58)

Xi

The intrinsic angular momentum of the K0 and K0 mesons is zero, or s(K0,K0)
= 0, as it must be. In simple terms, since the structure of K0 is (2.)π+ +
π−, the spin of K0 is the sum of the spin of (2.)π+ and of π−, both of which
do not have spin. It does not seem possible to arrive at s(K0,K0) = 0 if both
particles do not contain the N pairs of neutrinos and antineutrinos required
by the (2.)π± + π∓ state which we have suggested in Section 6.

In the case of the neutron one must wonder how it comes about that a
particle which seems to be the superposition of two particles without spin
ends up with spin 1/2. The neutron, which has a mass ≈ 2m(K±) or 2m(K0),
is either the superposition of a K+ and a K− meson or of a K0 and a K0 meson.
The intrinsic angular momentum of the superposition of K+ and K− is either
0 or ¯h, which means that the neutron cannot be the superposition of K+ and
K−. For a proof of this statement we must refer to [40].

On the other hand the neutron seems to be the superposition of a K0 and
a K0 meson. A signiﬁcant change in the lattice occurs when a K0 and a K0
meson are superposed. Since each K0 meson contains N neutrinos and N an-
tineutrinos, as we discussed before in context with the spin of K0, the number
of all neutrinos and antineutrinos in superposed K0 and K0 lattices is 4N.
Since the size of the lattice of the proton as well of the neutron is the same
as the size of K0 each of the N lattice points of the neutron now contains four
neutrinos, a muon neutrino and an anti-muon neutrino as well as an electron
neutrino and an anti-electron neutrino. The νµ, ¯νµ, νe, ¯νe quadrupoles oscil-

39

late just like individual neutrinos do because we learned from Eq.(7) that
the ratios of the oscillation frequencies are independent of the mass as well
as of the interaction constant between the lattice points.
In the neutrino
i j(4ni)
quadrupoles the spin of the neutrinos and antineutrinos cancels,
= 0. The superposition of two perpendicular neutrino lattice oscillations,
that means the circular oscillations of frequency νi, contribute as before the
i j(νi) = ¯h/2. The
angular momentum of the center circular oscillation, so
spin and charge of the four electrical charges hidden in the sum of the K0
and K0 mesons cancel. It follows that the intrinsic angular momentum of a
neutron created by the superposition of a K0 and a K0 meson comes from
the circular neutrino lattice oscillations only and is

as it must be.
In simple terms, the spin of the neutron originates from
the superposition of two perpendicular neutrino lattice oscillations with the
frequencies ω and − ω shifted in phase by π, which produces the angular
momentum ¯h/2.

The spin of the proton is 1/2 and is unambiguosly deﬁned by the decay
of the neutron n → p + e− + ¯νe. We have suggested in Section 7 that all
but N/4 anti-electron neutrinos of the neutrino lattice of the neutron are
removed in the β-decay of the neutron and that N/4 anti-electron neutrinos
leave with the emitted electron. The intrinsic angular momentum of the
proton originates then from the spin of the central νµ¯νµνe triplet, from the
spin of the e+e−e+ triplet which is part of the remains of the neutron, and
from the angular momentum of the center of the lattice oscillations with
the superposition of two perpendicular oscillations. The spin of the central
νµ¯νµνe triplet is canceled by the spin of the e+e−e+ triplet. According to the
standing wave model the intrinsic angular momentum of the proton is

j(p) = j(νµ¯νµνe)0 + j(e+e−e+) + j(ν0) = j(ν0) = ¯h/2 ,

(60)

as it must be.

The other mesons of the neutrino branch, the D±,0 and D±

s mesons, both
having zero spin, are superpositions of a proton and an antineutron of op-
posite spin, or of their antiparticles, or of a neutron and an antineutron of
opposite spin in D0. The spin of D± and D0 does therefore not pose a new
problem. The spin of D±

s is explained in [35].

40

For an explanation of the spin of µ± we refer to [45]. Since all muon or
antimuon neutrinos have been removed from the π± lattice in the π± decay
it follows that there is a vacancy in the center of the µ± lattice. Without a
neutrino in the center of the lattice the sum of the spin vectors of all neutrinos
in the µ± lattice is zero. However the µ± mesons consist of the neutrino
lattice plus an electric charge whose spin is 1/2. The spin of the µ± mesons
originates from the spin of the electric charge carried by the µ± mesons and
is consequently s(µ±) = 1/2. The same considerations apply for the spin of
τ ±, s(τ ±) = 1/2.

An explanation of the spin of the mesons and baryons can only be valid
if the same explanation also applies to the antiparticles of these particles
whose spin is the same as that of the ordinary particles. The antiparticles of
the γ-branch consist of electromagnetic waves whose frequencies diﬀer from
the frequencies of the ordinary particles only by their sign. The angular mo-
mentum of the superposition of two perpendicular oscillations with negative
sign has the same angular momentum as the superposition of two perpen-
dicular oscillations with positive sign, as in Λ. Consequently the spin of the
antiparticles of the γ-branch is the same as the spin of the ordinary particles
of the γ-branch. The same considerations apply to the circular neutrino lat-
tice oscillations which cause the spin of the neutron, the only particle of the
ν-branch which has spin. In the standing wave model the spin of the neutron
and the antineutron are the same.

Conclusions

We conclude that the standing wave model solves a number of problems
for which an answer heretofore has been hard to come by. Only photons,
neutrinos, charge and the weak nuclear force are needed to explain the masses
of the stable mesons and baryons and of the leptons. We can also explain
the spin of the mesons and baryons, and of the µ± and τ ± mesons as well.

1 introduction

The author in 2002 (1), introduced a new method for solving non linear

Partial diﬀerential equations. It seems that this method is able to solve a

vast majority of nonlinear partial Diﬀerential equations. So far, author has

been able to solve, Burgurs’ equation (1) and(2), Naviar Stokes equation in

one dimension(2) and Fischer equation.

In This artcle we will Solve The

well known Klein - Gordon Equation. As we will see This method makes the

To solve the problem we take φ to be a function of another unknown function

things very simple in many cases.

2 Solution

Klein-Gordon Equation in four Dimension Is;

∂2
∂2t

φ − ∇2φ + F (φ) = 0

like f (x, y, z, t) therefore;

In this way we will have;

φ(x, y, x, t) = φ(f (x, y, x, t))

∇2φ = ∇.∇φ =

Substituting equations (4) and (6) in Klein-Gordon equation,,(equation (1)),

will lead us to ;

)2 − (∇f )2] +

− ∇2f ] + F (φ) = 0

Since the function f (x, y, z, t) is quite an arbitrary function we choose it such

that, we can solve the above equation . There may be several choices, among

them we choose f (x, y, z, t) such that;

∇f =

−→
κ = αˆi + βˆj + γˆk

and

∂f
∂t

= λ

Here,α, β, γ and λ are constants. with this choice, f will come out to be;

here,

−→
r = xˆi + yˆj + zˆk, and therefore equation(7) will be simpliﬁed into;

f (x, y.z.t) = λt +

To solve this equation we suppose that;

G(φ) =

Therefore equation(10) will be written as;

= −F (φ)

Separating the variables and integrating both sides of the above equation will

give G as a function of φ;

G(φ) = ±

Since G(φ) has been deﬁned to be G(φ) = dφ

df , therefore;

and using equation(10) we may write the result in a more explicit form ;

3 discussion

Klein-Gordon equation is a well known equation and has been investigated

by many authors(For example see the references in reference3). The way we

have solved this equation is simple and straight forward. The result may

help us to solve the equation for any arbitrary potential easily, Of course in

cases that the term in equation(17)is integrable.

More over we solved the equation for a special form of f (x, y, z, t). We have

to see what other choices are possible. If we answer this question, the result

will lead us to other solutions for Klein- Gordon equation that may be, very

important in Physical applications.

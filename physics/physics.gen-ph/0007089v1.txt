Abstract

Mayers, Lo and Chau proved unconditionally se-
cure quantum bit commitment is impossible. It is
shown that their proof is valid only for conventional
quantum bit commitment protocols, in general it
does not hold good. Unconditionally secure entan-
gled and unentangled based (two steps and multi-
steps) quantum bit commitment protocols are pre-
sented. Unconditional security covers unknown at-
tacks and attacks arising due to noise. For a single
isolated bit, the probability of successful cheating is
sharply zero.

Conventional quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols [1,2] fail
if the legitimate users become dishonest to each other. To remove
these diﬃculty, bit commitment encoding was prescribed so that
sender can not cheat receiver.

To elucidate the issue, let us recall the BB-84 protocol [1], which
works on two steps processes. In the ﬁrst step, sender gives a qubit
representing a deﬁnite bit value to receiver and in second step he
reveals the key information regarding the bit value to receiver. The
problem is: sender can ﬂip the bit value by changing the key in-
formation although he committed the bit value in the ﬁrst step.
This is cheating. However the success of cheating decreases with
the number of bits of the key.
It was thought bit commitment
encoding could detect such cheating. As if in cryptograhic commu-
nication quantum mechanics could resist a committed partner to
be an imposter. If it be so, the long standing problems of cryptog-
raphy such as secure ideal quantum coin tossing, were also believed
to be solved.

The BB-84 QKD protocol can be called as ﬁrst QBC protocol.
However, authors observed that it is completely insecure against
sender’s EPR type attack. That is, the success of cheating is 100%.
Later on a QBC protocol [3] was proposed and claimed to be prob-
ably secure against all types of cheating. Mayer; Lo and Chau
proved [4,5] it incorrect but message of their work is that there
can not have any secure bit commitment protocol, although they
worked on a particular model of bit commitment encoding. Re-
cently kent [6] has shattered this belief. He showed that secure bit
commitment protocol exists. As security of his protocol is based on
causality not on laws of quantum mechanics, so it seems the proof
is valid for all quantum bit commitment protocols[7], which do not
use causality for security. If it be so, relativity wins over quantum
mechanics in cryptography. We shall see quantum mechanics is not

2

too weak to do bit commitment encoding.

Let us come to the point why their proof can not be generalized
for other quantum bit commitment protocol. Recall the reason-
ing of complete cheating. They concluded that complete cheating
is possible when two density matrices associated with bit 0 and 1
are same i.e ρ0 = ρ1. Because of this equivalence of two density
matrices, it can be shown from Schimidt decomposition that after
commit the states |0i sender can alone apply unitary transforma-
tion U to convert |0i to |1i and vice versa keeping the receiver in
dark about this transformation. But it does not necessarily mean
whenever ρ0 = ρ1 cheating will be possible.

Consider the following simple coding technique developed [8-9]

by the present author.

Bit 0 −→ {ψ, φ, ψ, φ, ψ, ψ, φ, φ, ψ, φ, .......................}
Bit 1 −→ {φ, φ, ψ, ψ, φ, ψ, ψ, φ, φ, ψ, ......................} .

Suppose these are two sequences of 0◦ and 45◦ (1:1) polarized
states of photons. So ρ0 = ρ1. The information regarding the above
two sequences are shared between sender and receiver. By sharing
these information they are in eﬀect sharing the Hilbert spaces of ρ0
and ρ1. Sender transmits the two sequences at random. But cheat-
ing is not possible as receiver can alone recover the bit value from
the information they initially shared. Bit commitment encoding
is not possible. In fact bit commitment encoding is not necessary.
Both are mutually committed to each other. This probably reveals
that cheating was possible in conventional QBC as because they
did not share the Hilbert spaces not because of the equivalence of
density matrices. This was ﬁrst realized in the initial stage of the
development of alternative QKD[8]. So sharing of Hilbert spaces
can be a precondition to have a secure QBC. First we shall present

3

entangled based QBC protocol and then unentangled based QBC
protocol.

Suppose Alice has n pairs of EPR particles. Taking one par-
ticle of each pair, she arranges in a particular fashion and taking
the partner particles she arranges in another way with the help of
quantum memory. Suppose the two arrangements are :

S0 = nψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4, ψ5, ........., ψ(n−2), ψ(n−1), ψno and
s0 = nψn, ψ(n−1), ψn, ................., ψ5, ψ4, ψ3, ψ2, ψ1o

where ψn

i=1 = 1/√2(↑↓ − ↓↑). The arrangement of entangle-

ment is: 1st particle of the 1st sequence and last particle of the
2nd sequence are entangled, and so on. These two arrangements
represent bit 0. To represent bit 1, similarly she can arrange them
in another two diﬀerent ways

S1 = nψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4, ψ5, ........., ψ(n−2), ψ(n−1), ψno and
s1 = nψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4, ψ5, .........., ψ(n−2), ψ(n−1), ψno.

The arrangement of entanglement is: 1st particle of the 1st se-
quence and 1st particle of the 1st sequence are entangled, and so
on. The above information is shared between them.

Bit commitment encoding can be executed in the following two
steps processes. In the ﬁrst step, Alice commits bit 0 sending S0
and in the second step she reveals the key information sending s0
. Similarly she can commit bit 1 sending S1 in the 1st step and
reveals its value sending s1 in the second step. Instead of directly
sending the 2nd sequence, the results of measurements on 2nd se-
quence in a pre-committed basis can also revealed. From the ﬁrst
incoming sequence S0 or S1 Bob can not recover the bit value.

4

He can alone recover the Alice’s committed bit when he will get
the partner sequence s0 or s1. He can measure the spin in a ﬁxed
direction. Measurements on two sequences of EPR particle will pro-
duce correlated data. Bob’s task is to identify the correlation from
initially shared information regarding the arrangement of EPR par-
ticles. This is essentially bit identiﬁcation from shared information.
If dishonest Alice sends s1 after S0 or s0 after S1, the one to one
EPR correlation will be lost. Her cheating will be exposed.

The above is an EPR based QBC protocol. Using superposition
state and following the same operational procedure non EPR based
QBC protocol is given. Let the supperposition states are:

|Ai0
|Bi0
|Ci1
|Di1

i = 1/√2(| ↔ir + | ↔is)
i = 1/√2(| ↔ir + | lis).
i = 1/√2(| ↔ir + | տցis)
i = 1/√2(| ↔ir + | ցտis).
The sequence of the state |Ai0

i and |Bi0

i and |Di0

i represent bit value 0
and the sequence of state |Ci0
i represents bit value 1. The
preparation of these superposition states are discussed in ref 8. To
commit the bit value in the 1st step Alice splitting each state | i
sends sequence of the truncated state | ir which does not contain
the bit value. The path s is the bit carrying path. Alice keeps
| is in quantum memory (using delay). So in the second step Alice
sends sequence of the state | is. From the two sequences Bob can
recover the bit value. If Alice changes incompatible sequence in the
second step Bob will be aware .

In the above two schemes, bit commitment encoding are two
step processes. QBC protocol can be realized in multi- steps proce-
dures. In the ﬁrst step Alice commits the bit value and reveals the
commitment in many steps. Yet the commitment is secure. The

5

encoding is same except we need higher dimensional Hilbert space
to execute multi-steps QBC. As for example they can take GHZ

state [11] (|ψiGH Z = 1/√2(| ↑G ↑H ↑Zi + | ↓G ↓H ↓Zi) to construct

three diﬀerent arrangements (sequences) G0, H 0 and Z 0. Similarly
Alice can arrange G1, H 1 and Z 1 to represent bit 1. Alice in the
ﬁrst step commits bit 0 by sending G0 and reveal the commitment
by sending H 0 and Z 0 in next two steps. Similarly she can commit
bit 1. If they want to have a multi- steps disentangled based QBC
scheme they can use a linear chain of superposition state of our
earlier protocol. For three steps (1+2 or 2+1 ) QBC, the superpo-
sition states are:

|Ai0
|Bi0
|Ci1
|Di1

i = 1/√3(| ↔ir + | ↔it + | ↔is)
i = 1/√3(| ↔ir + | ↔it + | lis)
i = 1/√3(| ↔ir + | ↔it + | տցis)
i = 1/√3(| ↔ir + | ↔it + | ցտis).
Alice commits by sending the sequence of states | ir and reveal
the commitment by sending the sequences of states | it ﬁrst and
then sending the actual bit value carrying sequence of states | is.
In noisy situation Bob can not expect perfect correlation so Al-
ice can execute the protocol dishonestly up to the noise level that
need not to be bothered. Bob can statistically faithfully recover the
bit value from noise due to initial sharing. The main advantage of
initial sharing of information of bit preparation is that we do not
have to be worried about any unknown attacks. Note that, sharing
means pre-commitment and this can give security even for unknown
attacks. Author feels that unconditional security claim should cover
unknown attacks. The BCJL scheme [3] failed because presently
known attack was unknown to the authors. The probability of the
success of cheating is always zero. The security does not depend
on time, space, technology, noise, and unknown attack. The proto-

6

cols are truly unconditionally secure against cheating. If they want
secure QKD along with secure QBC they can arrangement the en-
tanglement in a more random manner than the above example of
arrangements.

It is interesting to note that conventional QBC protocol totally
fails because of entanglement. The same entanglement provides
us secure QBC, although bit commitment is not the problem of
alternative QKD. Note that bit commitment encoding can not be
realized in all the sequence of unentangled state but can be realized
in the sequence of any type of entangled state. For bit commitment
issue, entanglement is not our enemy rather it is our friend indeed.

Following conventional quantum cryptography Lo and Chau
proved [12] that secure ideal quantum coin-tossing (IQC) is impos-
sible. This also can not be a generalized conclusion that we have
already shown in another paper[x]. Our QKD can simply mimic
ideal quantum coin tossing if sender and receiver randomly changes
their status. That is, Alice sends a sequence to produce a 0 or 1 at
Bob’s hand at random and Bob sends a sequence to generate a 0
or 1 at Alice’s hand at random. In eﬀect faithful random numbers
are generated at two distant locations because there is no chance
of cheating each other. This can be done either by using entangled
state or by unentangled state. Entanglement is not a necessary
condition to have secure IQC. Secure QBC is built on the top of
secure IQC. This is claimed to be always impossible by kent [13].
Still IQC is a weaker protocol because all QBC protocols are IQC
protocols but reverse is not true.

The QBC/IQC and QKD protocols deal two diﬀerent kind of se-
curity -security against cheating and security against eavesdropping
respectively. Security of QKD degrades due to noise. Eavesdrop-
per can manipulate noise. Recently we have shown [9] noise can

7

also be manipulated by the users to get rid of noise related security
problem of QKD. As noise based unconditionally secure QKD is
possible, we can have two type of unconditional security in a single
protocol. To date there is no other classical or quantum protocols
which oﬀer this double unconditional security. Therefore practical
realization of QBC protocols will be a challenging task.

Author is greatly inspired by the earlier development of quan-

tum cryptography.

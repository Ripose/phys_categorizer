The electronic structure of heavy elements, when described in a space-time which the metric is
aﬀected by the electromagnetic interaction, presents instabilities. These instabilities increase with
the atomic number, and above a critical value, become important. The consistency of this theory
[1],[2] and a formulation based on the energy-momentum tensor is also investigated. With this
procedure, a dynamical cut-oﬀ appears in a natural way, and the ﬁeld equations for the general
quantum mechanics are determined.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A fundamental question in the understanding of the Nature is if large-scale systems, such as stars or galaxies are
submitted to the same principles that rules the microscopic world. Should these small systems be considered as
microcosmos?

The microscopic world, is known to be explained in terms of the quantum mechanics and a key element for its
development was the study of the atomic structure. The success of the quantum theory in studying these systems,
conﬁrmed the foundations of the theory and allowed the description of a large number of systems such as molecules
and nuclei. The understanding of the physical reality by the quantum mechanics has been greatly improved with the
Dirac theory [3], that formulated the quantum mechanics in the framework of the special relativity with remarkable
success.

On the other hand, the Einstein general theory of relativity is another great achievement, that deals with the
structure of the space-time, and when applied to very large systems, gives very precise results also. Since 1930,
many works (as for example [15]-[17]) have been proposed with the objective of quantizing the gravity. Looking at
these questions from a diﬀerent point of view, a question that must remain in many heads is if the general relativity
formulation may have eﬀects, or at least, some analogy in the study of very small systems, such as atoms or elementary
particles.

In practical terms, one aspect of this question is if the microscopic world interactions, the weak, electromagnetic
and the strong, may aﬀect signiﬁcantly the space-time metric and if this proposition may have any observable eﬀect.
In this description, the gravitational forces may be neglected, and it is a good approximation, due to the small masses
of the considered particles. In [1], these ideas have been formulated considering a particle in a region with a potential,
that aﬀects the metric, and the wave equations for spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles have been proposed, generating very
interesting results.

The simplest systems where this theory could be tested are the one electron atoms, and the calculation of the
deuterium spectrum has shown a clear numerical improvement when compared with the usual Dirac spectrum [3],
[4] (also proposed by Sommerfeld [5]), with a percentual deviation from the experimental results approximately ﬁve
times smaller, near one additional digit of precision.

An interesting fact that appeared from this theory, is the existence of horizons of events inside these quantum
systems, with sizes that are not negligible. This propriety, that is related with the existence of a trapping surface at
r0, as it was deﬁned by Penrose [6], in [2] have been successfully used in order to describe quark conﬁnement. Solving
the quantum wave equations [2], quark conﬁnement has been obtained, without the need of introducing conﬁning
potentials, as it is currently done [7]- [10]. The conﬁnement obtained in this way is a strong conﬁnement, as the
quarks cannot reach r0.

In order to compliment this theory, the energy-momentum tensor T µν should be included in this formulation. This
study is made in Sect. 2 and consistence with the previous results is found. In Sect. 3, the eﬀect of instability in
heavy elements is studied, and in Sect. 4, the conclusions are shown.

II. FIELD EQUATIONS AND METRIC

In quantum systems, the electromagnetic and strong interactions dominate and the gravitational interaction is
negligible, as the masses of the considered particles are very small. Consequently, the gravitational potential may be

turned oﬀ, and then, the space-time metric is aﬀected only by the other interactions.

In this section, the ﬁeld equations for particles subjected to non gravitational interactions will be obtained. For
this purpose a brief review of the results of [1] will be made, and then, this results will be related with a formulation
based on the energy-momentum tensor.

For simplicity, a system with spherical symmetry will be considered, but the basic ideas can be generalized to
systems with arbitrary metrics. If the spherical symmetry is considered, the space-time may be described by the
metric derived in [1], that is very similar to the Schwarzschild metric [11],[12],

where r, θ and φ are the particle coordinates, ξ(r) is determined by the interaction potential V (r), and is a function
only of r, for a time independent interaction. In this case, the metric tensor gµν is diagonal

where ~β is the particle velocity. This relation means that in the rest frame of the particle, the energy is simply due
to the sum of its rest mass E0 with the potential, and then,

Applying these ideas in the study of one electron atoms, V is the Coulomb potential

α is the ﬁne structure constant and Z is the atomic number. Consequently, the function ξ is given by

where m is the electron mass. These expressions determine the horizon of events at r0, that appears from the metric
singularity ξ(r0)=0, and using the values of [13], one ﬁnds

that is not a negligible value at the atomic scale.

Now, let us turn our attention to a description based on the energy-momentum tensor.

determined by the energy-momentum tensor and the ﬁeld equations, with (7), determined by the energy relation (3).

Identifying the terms r−1 and r−2 we ﬁnd

The ﬁeld equation is then

So, in this system, due to the interaction, the electron energy decrease with r, until it reaches the value E(r0) = 0

at the horizon of events. At large distances, E(

) = m, the energy is obviously due only to its rest mass.
Considering that the strong interactions may be approximated by a strong Coulomb ﬁeld [2], with α

1, one
may use the ﬁeld equation (21) in order to study strongly interacting systems. But if one wants to describe the
strong interactions by the Yang-Mills ﬁeld, (21) is determined by the correct coupling constant α, and an Yang-Mills
energy-momentum tensor.

where Ψ is a four-component spinor. In a ﬁrst view, this equation may seem very similar to the Dirac equation, but it
shows some important diﬀerences. The ﬁrst one, is the numerical aspect, applying this theory to the deuterium atom
[1], the accord with the experimental values of the energy levels is improved in comparison with the Dirac spectrum
and shows deviations from the data of the order of 0.005%. Another characteristic of the general quantum mechanics,
2.8 fm, and,
is the existence of the horizon of events at r0. In the Hydrogen atom, this fact is not important, r0
from the solution of (22), an electron with energy of the order of few eV has a very small probability of being found
in this region, so, in practical terms, no eﬀect is observed. However, for heavy elements, that present larger nuclear
charges, the value of r0 may not be negligible as it increases with Z. For example, for the mercury, Z =80, so, r0=224
fm, should this value be important? In this section, the main objective is to study this eﬀect.

and from G, one gets the same relation.
The results for r0, rmin and rpeak are shown in Fig. 1-3.

In this framework, atomic instability eﬀects are expected to occur in elements that present rmin < r0, what means
that the 1S1/2 electron has signiﬁcant probability of reaching the horizon of events. In this case, the ground state is
unstable, and from (32), one notes that it happens for Z > 92.39. In view of these results (see Fig. 1) there is no
surprise in the fact that elements with atomic numbers greater than the critical value Z=92 (Uranium) are not found
in Nature, and exists only if synthesized artiﬁcially by man. If r0 = rpeak, the element will be very unstable, and it

that is a little bit above the last element, Rf (Rutherfordium), that has Z=104, fact that shows one more time that
the theory is in agreement with the observable world.

A point that must be remarked, is that these results are obtained only studying the electronic structure of the
elements, without considering their nuclear structures. As it is well known, some aspects of the interaction responsible
for the shell structure of the nuclei need to be understood, and one factor that may be considered, specially for heavy
elements, is the eﬀect of instability presented in this work.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper the study of the general quantum mechanics is been continued. The metric is determined by the
interaction of quantum objects, such as electrons and quarks. The eﬀect of the energy-momentum tensor of electro-
magnetic and strong interactions in the space-time has been considered, and with this procedure the the constant of
the ﬁeld equations has been calculated. The results obtained are consistent with the ones of [1].

One can observe the presence of the mass in the constant A, what does not happen in the general relativity, fact
g/m2, one concludes that the eﬀect of the curvature of
that is due to the equivalence principle. Observing that A
space-time, for a particle of mass m in a ﬁeld, decreases for large masses and increases for small masses and for large
coupling constants. It is interesting to note that a dynamical cut-oﬀ is determined by this theory, as it was used in
eq. (16), providing correct results.

∝

Another observation that must be made is that initially, spherical symmetry has been supposed, but eq. (21) is
general, independent of the symmetry of the system. This equation may also be used with the inclusion of other
interactions, as the Yang-Mills one, for example, considering the Yang-Mills ﬁeld tensor F a
µν in the construction of
the energy-momentum tensor, and quark conﬁnement, from the results of this theory, is expected to occur.

One must remark that with the development of the general quantum mechanics, we are being able to explain many
characteristics of the studied physical systems [1], [2], using the new proprieties that appears from the understanding
of the geometry of the space-time. The instability eﬀect presented in this paper is another result of the theory that
does not appear in the usual quantum mechanics, despite the fact that it is an observable eﬀect.

The Dirac theory introduced the special relativity in quantum mechanics, so it is very reasonable to think that the
next step is to formulate the quantum mechanics in a way analogous of the one that the general relativity is. But in
fact, the step proposed here, lead to a theory that absolutely is not a quantized version of general relativity, many
diﬀerences occur and some concepts of the general relativity are not the same ones in this formulation. The atomic
spectrum obtained in this way shows that the corrections of the energy levels, due to this general formulation of
quantum mechanics with the inclusion of the electric interaction in the space-time metric, provide a quite impressive
agreement with the experimental data, and is a strong evidence in the validation the theory. Another interesting
result is the hadron model [2], where quark conﬁnement is shown to be a consequence of this theory.

Abstract

Recently the anomalous behaviour of Fermions below the Fermi
temperature was analysed in detail from diﬀerent viewpoints. In the
present communication we obtain a justiﬁcation for this anomalous
semionic behaviour and also obtain the Cooper pair type scenario of
superconductivity from an alternative standpoint. Finally an earlier
result in one dimension that an assembly of Fermions at any temper-
ature behaves as if it is below the Fermi temperature is extended to
the two dimensional case.

1 Introduction

In a previous communication[1] it was argued that Fermions would exhibit
Bosonization eﬀects below the Fermi temperature. The arguments were
corraborated by considerations from Quantum Field Theory and a recent
model that describes Fermions as Kerr-Newman type Black Holes, bounded
by the Compton wavelength.
To put it brieﬂy, at low temperatures or length scales far greater than the
Compton wavelength, the Fermion character would get blurred and we would
have a semionic behaviour.
These arguments are pushed further so that we obtain a justiﬁcation for the
semionic behaviour on the one hand and an alternative explanation for the
Cooper pairs of superconductivity on the other. In the process we obtain an
insight into low dimensional behaviour.

2 Fractal Charges and Cooper Pairs

In the context of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole type description of Fermions,
it has been pointed out that the three dimensionality of space is intimately
tied up with spin half and that each dimension contributes a charge e/3 [2, 3].
Indeed in low dimensions, we encounter these fractional charges, as has been
shown, starting with the work of Laughlin[4, 5, 6].
Recently experiments with the Quantum Hall Eﬀect conﬁrm the e/3 frac-
tional charges[7, 8].
With this background we now observe that, the energy density ǫ below the
fermi energy is given by

ǫ ∝

Z

o

pF

p2
2m

d3p ∝ T 2.5
F

(1)

where pF is the Fermi momentum and TF is the Fermi temperature.
Let us compare (1) with the result for n dimensions viz., [9, 10]

ǫ ∝ T n+1

F

We conclude that the assembly behaves as if it has the fractal dimensionality
1.5. (We will come to the low dimensional Bosonization in the next Section).
For the moment we observe that with this dimensionality and the fact that
the charge per dimension is e/3 as noted above, the charge of the Fermions
would be e/2.
The half charge would lead to a Cooper pair type scenario. One way to see
this is, in the case of a Coulumb potential for example [?] the energy levels
would be given by

rather than

En = −|En| = −

µZ 2e4
8¯h2n2 ,

En = −

µZ 2e4
2¯h2n2 ,

as in conventional theory owing to the fact that the e2 of the electron is
replaced by e2/4. Eﬀectively n is replaced by 2n.
Alternatively, if the fundamental ratio e2/Gm2 where m is the mass of the
electron, has to retain its value, then, the mass also would have to be halved.
Either way eﬀectively we encounter pairs of electrons which ofcourse have

the usual Bosonic behaviour of superconductivity.
Another way of looking at this is that below the Fermi temperature we have,
as is well known,[12]

4πV
h3 Zǫp<ǫF

hnpip2dp = N

where hnpi is the Fermionic occupation number and N is the number of
particles.
Integrating by parts and remembering that d
delta function peaking at p ≈ pF , (the fermi momentum), we have

dphnpi is, as is well known[12] a

V
(2π¯h)3

p3
F = N

Equation (2) diﬀers from the usual theory in that its left side is half the usual
value, again indicating the pairing of electrons.

3 Low Dimensional Behaviour

In [1], it was argued that in one dimension the assembly behaves as if it were
below the Fermi temperature, whatever be the temperature. Indeed this low
temperature Quantum nature has recently been experimentally veriﬁed with
carbon nanotubes [13, 14].
We can come to a similar conclusion in the two dimensional case also. In
this case, for the Fermi temperature we can easily adapt the usual three
dimensional theory (cf.ref.[12]) to two dimensions to obtain

where v ≡ V

N . Now using the expression for total energy

NkT ≈ U =

hnpidp,

whence invoking a partial integration as in the previous Section we get

λ2 =

which is the same as equation (3). However in this case we have worked at
an arbitrary temperature T .
It may be mentioned that we encounter the
Quantum behaviour and two dimensionality at the interface between two
semiconductors.
Indeed independant of the above considerations, is the fact that Fermions
described in the Dirac equation in one and two dimensions display neutrino
type behaviour as has been noted earlier[1, ?, 16].

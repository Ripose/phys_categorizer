Euclidean formulation of general relativity

A variational principle is applied to 4D Euclidean space provided with a tensor
refractive index, deﬁning what can be seen as 4-dimensional optics (4DO). The ge-
ometry of such space is analysed, making no physical assumptions of any kind. How-
ever, by assigning geometric entities to physical quantities the paper allows physical
predictions to be made. A mechanism is proposed for translation between 4DO and
GR, which involves the null subspace of 5D space with signature (

+ + + +).

A tensor equation relating the refractive index to sources is established geometri-
cally and the sources tensor is shown to have close relationship to the stress tensor of
GR. This equation is solved for the special case of zero sources but the solution that is
found is only applicable to Newton mechanics and is inadequate for such predictions
as light bending and perihelium advance. It is then argued that testing gravity in
the physical world involves the use of a test charge which is itself a source. Solving
the new equation, with consideration of the test particle’s inertial mass, produces an
exponential refractive index where the Newtonian potential appears in exponent and
provides accurate predictions. Resorting to hyperspherical coordinates it becomes
possible to show that the Universe’s expansion has a purely geometric explanation
without appeal to dark matter.

1 Introduction

According to general consensus any physics theory is based on a set of principles upon which
predictions are made using established mathematical derivations; the validity of such theory
depends on agreement between predictions and observed physical reality.
In that sense this
paper does not formulate a physical theory because it does not presume any physical principles;
for instance it does not assume speed of light constancy or equivalence between frame acceleration
and gravity. This is a paper about geometry. All along the paper, in several occasions, a parallel
is made with the physical world by assigning a physical meaning to geometric entities and this
allows predictions to be made. However the validity of derivations and overall consistency of the
exposition is independent of prediction correctness.

The only postulates in this paper are of a geometrical nature and can be condensed in the
deﬁnition of the space we are going to work with: 4-dimensional space with Euclidean signature
(+ + ++). For the sole purpose of making transitions to spacetime we will also consider the
null subspace of the 5-dimensional space with signature (
+ + + +). This choice of space
does not imply any assumption about its physical meaning up to the point where geometric

entities like coordinates and geodesics start being assigned to physical quantities like distances
and trajectories. Some of those assignments will be made very early in the exposition and will
be kept consistently until the end in order to allow the reader some assessment of the proposed
geometric model as a tool for the prediction of physical phenomena. Mapping between geometry
and physics is facilitated if one chooses to work always with non-dimensional quantities; this
is easily done with a suitable choice for standards of the fundamental units. In this work all
problems of dimensional homogeneity are avoided through the use of normalising factors for all
units, listed in Table 1, deﬁned with recourse to the fundamental constants: Planck constant,
gravitational constant, speed of light and proton charge. This normalisation deﬁnes a system of
non-dimensional units with important consequences, namely: 1) all the fundamental constants,
~, G, c, e, become unity; 2) a particle’s Compton frequency, deﬁned by ν = mc2/~, becomes
equal to the particle’s mass; 3) the frequent term GM /(c2r) is simpliﬁed to M/r.

The particular space we chose to work with can have amazing structure, providing countless
parallels to the physical world; this paper is just a limited introductory look at such structure and
parallels. The exposition makes full use of an extraordinary and little known mathematical tool
called geometric algebra (GA), a.k.a. Cliﬀord algebra, which received an important thrust with
the introduction of geometric calculus by David Hestenes [1]. A good introduction to GA can be
found in Gull et al. [2] and the following paragraphs use basically the notation and conventions
therein. A complete course on physical applications of GA can be downloaded from the internet
[3] with a more comprehensive version published recently in book form [4] while an accessible
presentation of mechanics in GA formalism is provided by Hestenes [5].

2 Introduction to geometric algebra

We will use Greek characters for the indices that span 1 to 4 and Latin characters for those
that exclude the 4 value; in rare cases we will have to use indices spanning 0 to 3 and these will
be denoted with Greek characters with an over bar. The geometric algebra of the hyperbolic
5-dimensional space we want to consider
4,1 is generated by the frame of orthonormal vectors

The geometric product of any two vectors a = a0i+aµσµ and b = b0i+bνσν can be decomposed
into a symmetric part, a scalar called the inner product, and an anti-symmetric part, a bivector
called the exterior product.

When a vector is operated with a multivector the inner product reduces the grade of each element
by one unit and the outer product increases the grade by one. There are two exceptions; when
operated with a scalar the inner product does not produce grade
1 but grade 1 instead, and
the outer product with a pseudoscalar is disallowed.

These equations deﬁne the metrics of two alternative spaces, one Euclidean the other one
Minkowskian, both equivalent to the null 5-dimensional subspace.

A path on null space does not have any aﬃne parameter but we can use Eqs. (9) to express
4 coordinates in terms of the ﬁfth one. We will frequently use the letter t to refer to coordinate
x0 and the letter τ for coordinate x4; total derivatives with respect to t will be denoted by an
over dot while total derivatives with respect to τ will be denoted by a ”check”, as in ˇF . Dividing
both members of Eq. (7) by dt we get

This is the deﬁnition for the velocity vector v; it is important to stress again that the velocity
vector deﬁned here is a geometrical entity which bears for the moment no relation to physical
velocity, be it relativistic or not. The velocity has unit norm because ˙s2 = 0; evaluation of v
v
yields the relation

The velocity vector can be obtained by a suitable rotation of any of the σµ frame vectors, in
particular it can always be expressed as a rotation of the σ4 vector.

At this point we are going to make a small detour for the ﬁrst parallel with physics. In the

previous equation we replace x0 by the greek letter τ and rewrite with ˙τ 2 in the ﬁrst member

˙τ 2 = 1

The relation above is well known in special relativity, see for instance Martin [6]; see also Almeida
[7], Montanus [8] for parallels between special relativity and its Euclidean space counterpart.1 We
note that the operation performed between Eqs. (11) and (12) is a perfectly legitimate algebraic
operation since all the elements involved are pure numbers. Obviously we could also divide both
members of Eq. (7) by dτ , which is then associated with relativistic proper time;

0
ˇs = iˇx

+ σj ˇxj + σ4.

Squaring the second member and noting that it must be null we obtain (ˇx0)2
(ˇxj )2 = 1. This
means that we can relate the vector iˇx0 + σj ˇxj to relativistic 4-velocity, although the norm of
this vector is symmetric to what is usual in SR. The relativistic 4-velocity is more conveniently
assigned to the 5D bivector iσ4 ˇx0 + σj4 ˇxj, which has the necessary properties. The method we
have used to make the transition between 4D Euclidean space and hyperbolic spacetime involved
the transformation of a 5D vector into scalar plus bivector through product with σ4; this method
will later be extended to curved spaces.

P

Equation (10) applies to ﬂat space but can be generalised for curved space; we do this in two
steps. First of all we can include a scale factor (v = nσµ ˙xµ), which can change from point to
point

˙s = i + nσµ ˙xµ.

(14)

In this way we are introducing the 4-dimensional analogue of a refractive index, that can be seen
as a generalisation of the 3-dimensional deﬁnition of refractive index for an optical medium: the
quotient between the speed of light in vacuum and the speed of light in that medium. The scale
factor n used here relates the norm of vector σµ ˙xµ to unity and so it deserves the designation
of 4-dimensional refractive index; we will drop the ”4-dimensional” qualiﬁcation because the
confusion with the 3-dimensional case can always be resolved easily. The material presented in
this paper is, in many respects, a logical generalisation of optics to 4-dimensional space; so, even
if the paper is only about geometry, it becomes natural to designate this study as 4-dimensional
optics (4DO).

Full generalisation of Eq. (10) implies the consideration of a tensor refractive index, similar to

the non-isotropic refractive index of optical media

the velocity is then generally deﬁned by v = nµ
ν ˙xν σµ. The same expression can be used with
any orthonormal frame, including for instance spherical coordinates, but for the moment we will
restrict our attention to those cases where the frame does not rotate in a displacement; this poses
no restriction on the problems to be addressed but is obviously inconvenient when symmetries
are involved. Equation (15) can be written with the velocity in the form v = gν ˙xν if we deﬁne
the refractive index vectors

independent work along the same lines.

is still a unitary vector and we can express this fact evaluating the internal product with itself

The generalised form of the displacement vector arises from multiplying Eq. (15) by dt, using
the deﬁnition (16)

This can be put in the form of a space metric by dotting with itself and noting that the ﬁrst
member vanishes

Notice that the coordinates are still referred to the ﬁxed frame vectors σµ and not to the refractive
index vectors gµ. In GR there is no such distinction between two frames but Montanus [8] clearly
separates the frame from tensor gµν.

This equation covers a large number of situations in general relativity, including the very impor-
tant Schwarzschild’s metric, as was shown in Almeida [9] and will be discussed below. Notice
that Eq. (20) has more information than Eq. (23) because the structure of g4 is kept in the
former, through the coeﬃcients gµ4, but is mostly lost in the g44 coeﬃcient of the latter.

4 The sources of space curvature

Equations (20) and (23) deﬁne two alternative 4-dimensional spaces; in the former, 4DO, t is an
aﬃne parameter while in the latter, GR, it is τ that takes such role. The geodesics of one space
can be mapped one to one with those of the other and we can choose to work on the space that
best suits us.

vµ =

∂L
∂ ˙xµ = gµν ˙xν .

The justiﬁcation for this choice of Lagrangian can be found in several reference books but see
for instance Martin [6]. From the Lagrangian one deﬁnes immediately the conjugate momenta

The conjugate momenta are the components of the conjugate momentum vector v = gµvµ and
from Eq. (21)

v = gµvµ = gµgµν ˙xν = gν ˙xν .

The conjugate momentum and velocity are the same but their components are referred to the
reverse and refractive index frames, respectively.

The geodesic equations can now be written in the form of Euler-Lagrange equations

these equations deﬁne those paths that minimise t when displacements are made with velocity
given by Eq. (15). Considering the parallel already made with general relativity we can safely say
that geodesics of 4DO spaces have a one to one correspondence to those of GR in the majority
of situations.

We are going to need geometric calculus which was introduced by Hestenes and Sobczyk [1] as
said earlier; another good reference is provided by Doran and Lasenby [4]. The existence of such
references allows us to introduce the vector derivative without further explanation; the reader
should search the cited books for full justiﬁcation of the deﬁnition we give below

The vector derivative is a vector and can be operated with any multivector using the established
rules; in particular the geometric product of (cid:3) with a multivector can be decomposed into
inner and outer products. When applied to vector a ((cid:3)a = (cid:3)
a) the inner product is
the divergence of vector a and the outer product is the exterior derivative, related to the curl
although usable in spaces of arbitrary dimension and expressed as a bivector. We also deﬁne
the Laplacian as the scalar operator (cid:3)2 = (cid:3)
(cid:3). In this work we do not use the conventions of
Riemanian geometry for the aﬃne connection, as was already noted in relation to Eq. (21). For
this reason we will also need to distinguish between the curved space derivative deﬁned above
and the ordinary ﬂat space derivative

When using spherical coordinates, for instance, the connection will be involved only in the ﬂat
space component of the derivative and we will deal with it by explicitly expressing the frame
vector derivatives.

Velocity is a vector with very special signiﬁcance in 4DO space because it is the unitary vector
tangent to a geodesic. We therefore attribute high signiﬁcance to velocity derivatives, since they
express the characteristics of the particular space we are considering. When the Laplacian is
applied to the velocity vector we obtain a vector

Vector T is called the sources vector and can be expanded into sixteen terms as

T = T µ

νσµ ˙xν = ((cid:3)2nµ

ν)σµ ˙xν .

(32)

The tensor T µ
ν contains the coeﬃcients of the sources vector and we call it the sources tensor ;
it is very similar to the stress tensor of GR, although its relation to geometry is diﬀerent. The
sources tensor inﬂuences the shape of geodesics but we shall not examine here how such inﬂuence
arises, except for very special cases.

Before we begin searching solutions for Eq. (31) we will show that this equation can be de-
composed into a set of equations similar to Maxwell’s. Consider ﬁrst the velocity derivative
v; the result is a multivector with scalar and bivector part G = (cid:3)v. Now derive
(cid:3)v = (cid:3)
v + (cid:3)
∧

again (cid:3)G = (cid:3)
G + (cid:3)
G; we know that the exterior derivative of G vanishes and the divergence

equals the sources vector. Maxwell’s equations can be written in a similar form, as was shown in
Almeida [10], with velocity replaced by the vector potential and multivector G replaced by the
Faraday bivector F ; Doran and Lasenby [4] oﬀer similar formulation for spacetime.

∧

An isotropic space must be characterised by orthogonal refractive index vectors gµ whose norm
can change with coordinates but is the same for all vectors. We usually relax this condition by
accepting that the three gj must have equal norm but g4 can be diﬀerent. The reason for this
relaxed isotropy is found in the parallel usually made with physics by assigning dimensions 1 to
3 to physical space. Isotropy in a physical sense need only be concerned with these dimensions
and ignores what happens with dimension 4. We will therefore characterise an isotropic space by
the refractive index frame gj = nrσj, g4 = n4σ4. Indeed we could also accept a non-orthogonal
g4 within the relaxed isotropy concept but we will not do so in this work.

We will only investigate spherically symmetric solutions independent of x4; this means that the
refractive index can be expressed as functions of r in spherical coordinates. The vector derivative
in spherical coordinates is of course

When applied to n4 and equated to zero we obtain solutions which impose n4 = nr and so the
space must be truly isotropic and not relaxed isotropic as we had allowed. The solution we
have found for the refractive index components in isotropic space can correctly model Newton
dynamics, which led the author to adhere to it for some time [11]. However if inserted into Eq.
(24) this solution produces a GR metric which is veriﬁably in disagreement with observations;
consequently it has purely geometric signiﬁcance.

The inadequacy of the isotropic solution found above for relativistic predictions deserves some
thought, so that we can search for solutions guided by the results that are expected to have
physical signiﬁcance. In the physical world we are never in a situation of zero sources because
the shape of space or the existence of a refractive index must always be tested with a test particle.
A test particle is an abstraction corresponding to a point mass considered so small as to have
no inﬂuence on the shape of space. But in reality a test particle is always a source of refractive
index and its inﬂuence on the shape of space may not be negligible in any circumstances. If this
is the case the solutions for vanishing sources vector may have only geometric meaning, with no
connection to physical reality.

The question is then how do we include the test particle in Eq. (31) in order to ﬁnd physically
meaningful solutions. Here we will make one add hoc proposal without further justiﬁcation be-
cause the author has not yet completed the work that will provide such justiﬁcation in geometric
terms. The second member of Eq. (31) will not be zero and we will impose the sources vector

Equation (31) becomes

as a result the equation for nr remains unchanged but the equation for n4 becomes

When nr is given the exponential form found above the solution is n4 = √nr. This can now be en-
tered into Eq. (24) and the coeﬃcients can be expanded in series and compared to Schwarzschild’s
for the determination of parameter a. The ﬁnal solution, for a stationary mass M is

Equation (39) can be interpreted in physical terms as containing the essence of gravitation.
When solved for spherically symmetric solutions, as we have done, the ﬁrst member provides
the deﬁnition of a stationary gravitational mass as the factor M appearing in the exponent and
2n4. Gravitational mass is deﬁned with recourse
the second member deﬁnes inertial mass as
to some particle which undergoes its inﬂuence and is animated with velocity v and inertial mass
cannot be deﬁned without some ﬁeld n4 acting upon it. Complete investigation of the sources
tensor elements and their relation to physical quantities is not yet done. It is believed that the
16 terms of this tensor have strong links with homologous elements of stress tensor in GR but
this will have to be veriﬁed.

Finally we turn our attention to hyperspherical coordinates. The position vector is quite
simply x = τ στ , where the coordinate is the distance to the hypersphere centre. Diﬀerentiating
the position vector we obtain the displacement vector, which is a natural generalisation of 3D
spherical coordinates case

ρ, θ and ϕ are angles. The velocity in an isotropic medium should now be written as

v = n4στ ˙τ + nrτ (σρ ˙ρ + sin ρσθ ˙θ + sin ρ sin θσϕ ˙ϕ).

we have also replaced σρ by σr for consistency with the new coordinates.

We have just deﬁned a particularly important set of coordinates, which appears to be especially
well adapted to describe the physical Universe, with τ being interpreted as the Universe’s age
or its radius; note that time and distance cannot be distinguished in non-dimensional units.
When r ˙τ /τ is small in Eq. (45), the refractive index vectors become orthogonal and we use n4
and nr in conjunction with Eq. (24) to obtain a GR metric whose coeﬃcients are equivalent so
Schwarzschild’s on the ﬁrst terms of their series expansions. When r ˙τ /τ cannot be neglected,
however, the equation can explain the Universe’s expansion and ﬂat rotation curves in galaxies
without dark matter intervention. A more complete discussion of this subject can be found in
Ref. [9].

5 Conclusions

Euclidean and Minkowskian 4-spaces can be formally linked through the null subspace of 5-
dimensional space with signature (
+ + + +). The extension of such formalism to non-ﬂat
spaces allows the transition between spaces with both signatures and the paper discusses some
conditions for metric and geodesic translation. For its similarities with optics, the geometry of
4-spaces with Euclidean signature is called 4-dimensional optics (4DO). Using only geometric
arguments it is possible to deﬁne such concepts as velocity and trajectory in 4DO which become
physical concepts when proper and natural assignments are made.

One important point which is addressed for the ﬁrst time in the author’s work is the link
between the shape of space and the sources of curvature. This is done on geometrical grounds
but it is also placed in the context of physics. The equation pertaining to the test of gravity
by a test particle is proposed and solved for the spherically symmetric case providing a solution
equivalent to Schwarzschild’s as ﬁrst approximation. Some mention is made of hyperspherical
coordinates and the reader is referred to previous work linking this geometry to the Universe’s
expansion in the absence of dark matter.

Abstract. The phrase “negative squared rest mass” can sometimes be found

in papers on neutrinos and frequently occurs in the tachyonic literature. Conse-

quently, some authors say that “the rest mass of tachyons is imaginary”. Besides,

the statement “photons have zero rest mass” is almost common. In terms of rel-

ativity, however, the state of rest cannot be reasonably deﬁned for luxons and

tachyons, and, therefore, today it does not make sense to speak of rest mass of

such objects. It is shown here that the phrases “negative squared mass”, “imagi-

nary mass”, and “photon’s zero mass” result from applying bradyonic dynamical

relativistic relations to determine properties of luxons and tachyons; and that this

erroneous procedure results from an unfortunate interpretation of kinematical rel-

ativistic relations. It is also shown that the use of proper relativistic relations,

i.e. luxonic or tachyonic ones, gives a positive quantity having the squared mass

dimension. Thus we obtain a nonzero real quantity having the mass dimension

(called masslike quantity), which is positive for the photon and may (by intuition

– should) be positive for other luxons and for tachyons.

From some papers on measurements of the neutrino mass one can learn that

“the squared rest mass of neutrinos is negative”. In the tachyonic literature it is

frequently stated that “the squared rest mass of tachyons is negative”, and, con-

sequently, some authors conclude that “the rest mass of tachyons is imaginary”,

though in the case of neutrinos I have not met such a heroic author. Besides, the

statement “photons have zero rest mass” is almost common. These statements

are said to be conclusions from relativity but this is not true.

In relativity the term “rest mass” does not make sense in the case of luxons

and tachyons, since the state of rest can be reasonably deﬁned for these objects

neither within standard relativity nor in its consistent extensions. This is obvious

in the luxonic case since, e.g., the Lorentz transformation is singular for speeds

equal to c. If we were to assume that any tachyon may be at rest, then three

independent states of its rest would have to exist since observers who see our

spacetime as that having three time dimensions and only one space dimension

would then have to be admitted.

As regards the phrases “negative squared mass”, “imaginary mass”, and “pho-

ton’s zero mass”, we shall proceed step by step.

Consider the world line xµ (σ) of a pointlike object. Assume, for simplicity,

that the object is free in ﬂat spacetime endowed with the Lorentzian coordinates

(i.e. xµ (σ) is straight), that σ is the normalized aﬃne parameter of xµ (σ), and

that the signature is, e.g., + + + − . Note that in the metric form expressions,
ds2 = dxµdxµ, ds2 is only a conventional symbol, and therefore it need not be

the square of an inﬁnitesimal real quantity. In the case under consideration

ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 − c2dt2,

and for xµ (σ) we have

where dσ is indeed an inﬁnitesimal real quantity, and where the discrete dimen-

sionless parameter k is as follows:

k = 1 in the bradyonic (timelike, subluminal) case,

k = 0 in the luxonic (null, luminal) case, and

k = −1 in the tachyonic (spacelike, superluminal) case.

(If the signature + − − − were chosen, then by Eq. (2) we would have k = −1

in the bradyonic case and k = 1 in the tachyonic case.) Dividing Eqs. (1) and

2
(2) by (dσ)

we get

where uµ := dxµ/dσ is a four-velocity vector. The kinematical Eq. (3) concerns

every type of world lines – timelike, null, and spacelike. The type is determined

Multiplying Eq. (3) by m2c2, where m has the mass dimension (we do not

yet determine physical meanings of m), we get the well-known special relativistic

formula for a four-momentum vector pµ:

(not speaking that the multiplication of equations by zero does not make sense).

If m were imaginary, then by deﬁnition (5) also the four-momentum components

pµ would be imaginary, which would give us a new physics yet unknown. If we

had real m < 0, then by deﬁnition (5) we would have opposite senses of the four-

vectors uµ and pµ. Such a situation is yet unknown and today seems strange,

though perhaps it will be considered in future. Anyway, we are entitled to put real

m > 0 for every type of the objects under consideration (Ockham’s principle!).

m 6= 0.

The unfortunate phrases have resulted from the fact that some authors have

not taken into account the existence of three values of k (1, 0, −1) and have

applied the bradyonic variants of Eqs. (1)–(4) for luxons and tachyons. The use

of proper values of k allows to avoid the diﬃculties.

In the bradyonic case, m is the rest mass of our object. In the luxonic case

the physical meaning of m is not determined in general, though it is so for the
photon for which m = c−2E = c−2hν > 0. Anyway, the dynamical luxonic
relation p2c2 = E2 does not result from the condition m = 0, which is false

(inequality (6)), but it does result from the condition k = 0, i.e. it is determined

at the kinematical level of Eqs. (1)–(3). In the tachyonic case we have yet no

operational deﬁnition of m (for lack of rest), and therefore the term “masslike

quantity” has been proposed.

(The terms “pseudomass” or “quasimass” are

shorter but semantically inferior.)

Additional remarks and amusing details can be found in Section 6 of my prior

paper [1].

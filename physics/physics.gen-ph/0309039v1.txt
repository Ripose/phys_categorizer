GRAVITATIONAL WAVES AND ETHER’S WIND

ANGELO LOINGER

Abstract. A very recent research validates observationally the theo-
retical demonstrations of the physical non-existence of the gravitational
waves.

Recently (August 14th, 2003) it has been published on Los Alamos Archive
(arXiv:gr-qc/0308050 v1) an observational paper by 368 co-authors (B.Ab-
bott . . . J.Zweizig) entitled “Setting upper limits on the strength of periodic
gravitational waves using the ﬁrst science data from the GEO600 and LIGO
detectors”.

Its abstract is as follows: “Data collected by the GEO600 and LIGO
interferometric gravitational wave detectors during their ﬁrst observational
science run were searched for continuous gravitational waves from the pul-
sar J1939+2134 at twice its rotation frequency. Two independent analysis
methods were used and are demonstrated in this paper: a frequency domain
method and a time domain method. Both achieve consistent null results,
placing new upper limits on the strength of the pulsar’s gravitational wave
emission. A model emission mechanism is used to interpret the limits as a
constraint on the pulsar’s equatorial ellipticity.”

These null results could have been foreseen – and in a very simple way.
A fundamental article of 1917 by T.Levi Civita [1] has demonstrated that
the gravitational waves are mere formal undulations, fully destitute of en-
ergy and momentum, only endowed with a false (pseudo) tensor (i.e. a
non-tensor) of energy-momentum. As a matter of fact, Einstein had al-
ways serious doubts about the physical reality of the gravitational waves,
see e.g. his paper with Rosen of 1935 [2], even if the notion “gravitational
wave” had been theorized by him in 1916 [3]. But in this paper he inves-
tigated the approximate linearized version of the exact general relativity
(version whose substrate is simply Minkowski spacetime), which resembles
the Minkowskian formulation of e.m. Maxwell theory, and which has an
invariant character only under the transformations of Lorentz group. On
the contrary, Levi-Civita [1] made a frontal attack to the analogous problem
of the exact GR, for which the variable metric is, in essence, spacetime –
and not a conventional ﬁeld propagated through a ﬁxed substrate.

In recent years I have given speciﬁc and stringent proofs of the physical
non-existence of the gravitational waves [4], in particular of the absence of
any generation mechanism whatever.

It is a pity that in 2003 the above 368 physicists base essentially their
belief in the real existence of gravitational waves on the cited Einstein’s
paper of 1916 [3], fully neglecting some basic concepts of the exact GR
[5]. Of course, they have the possibility of persevering on their road with
the aim to lower more and more the upper limits of the strength of the
gravitational waves. And in fact they write that “further improvements are
planned”: a vain chase to nothing.
In the Forties of the past century a
distinguished experimentalist, Quirino Majorana (uncle of Ettore M.), had
succeeded in lowering to the intensity of a very gentle breeze the upper
limit of the strength of terrestrial ether’s wind; he used just a Michelson
interferometer.

An Italian proverb says: “Chi si contenta gode”.

In a geometric approach to special relativity it is found that the spin four-tensor Sab can be decomposed into two
4-vectors, the usual “space-space” intrinsic angular momentum Sa and a new one, the “time-space” intrinsic angular
momentum Z a, which are both equally well physical quantities.
It is also shown that an electric dipole moment
(EDM) of a fundamental particle, as a four-dimensional geometric quantity, is determined by Z a and not, as generally
accepted, by the spin S. The consequences for elementary particle theories and experiments that search for EDM,
and also for the investigation of quantum phase shifts with dipoles, are brieﬂy discussed.

In this paper a geometric approach to special relativity is considered in which a physical reality is attributed to the
four-dimensional (4D) geometric quantities and not, as usually accepted, to the 3D quantities. Using a general rule for
the decomposition of a second rank antisymmetric tensor the spin four-tensor Sab is decomposed into two 4-vectors,
the usual “space-space” intrinsic angular momentum Sa and a new one, the “time-space” intrinsic angular momentum
Z a, (4). It is shown (5) that an electric dipole moment (EDM) of a fundamental particle, as a 4D geometric quantity,
is determined by Z a and not by the spin S. (The vectors in the 3D space will be designated in bold-face.) Then it is
explicitly shown that neither the T inversion nor the P inversion are good symmetries in the 4D spacetime. In our
geometric approach only the world parity W , xa → −xa, is well-deﬁned in the 4D spacetime. Hence, in this approach,
the existence of an EDM is not connected in any way with T violation, or, under the assumption of CPT invariance,
with CP violation.

We shall deal with 4D geometric quantities that are deﬁned without reference frames. They will be called the
absolute quantities (AQs), e.g., the 4-vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds Ea and Ba, the electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor F ab, the dipole moment tensor Dab, the 4-vectors of the electric dipole moment (EDM) da and the
magnetic dipole moment (MDM) ma, etc. In the following we shall rely on the results and the explanations from
[1], see also references therein. As said in [1], according to [2], F ab can be taken as the primary quantity for the
whole electromagnetism. Ea and Ba are then derived from F ab and the 4-velocity of the observers va; F ab =
(1/c)(Eavb − Ebva) + εabcdvcBd, whence Ea = (1/c)F abvb and Ba = (1/2c2)εabcdFbcvd, with Eava = Bava = 0. The
frame of “ﬁducial” observers, in which the observers who measure Ea, Ba are at rest with the standard basis {eµ} in
it is called the e0-frame. (The standard basis {eµ; 0, 1, 2, 3} consists of orthonormal 4-vectors with e0 in the forward
light cone. It corresponds to the speciﬁc system of coordinates with Einstein’s synchronization [3] of distant clocks
and Cartesian space coordinates xi.) In the e0-frame E0 = B0 = 0 and Ei = F i0, Bi = (1/2c)εijk0Fjk. Therefore Ea
and Ba can be called the “time-space” part and the “space-space” part, respectively, of F ab.

In fact, as proved in, e.g., [4], any second rank antisymmetric tensor can be decomposed into two 4-vectors and
a unit time-like 4-vector (the 4-velocity/c). This rule can be applied to Dab. As shown in [1], Dab is the primary
quantity for dipole moments. Then da and ma are derived from Dab and the 4-velocity of the particle ua

Dab = (1/c)(uadb − ubda) + (1/c2)εabcducmd, ma = (1/2)εabcdDbcud, da = (1/c)Dbaub,

with daua = maua = 0. Only in the particle’s rest frame (the K ′ frame) and the {e′

part, respectively, of Dab.

µ} basis d′0 = m′0 = 0,
jk. Therefore da and ma can be called the “time-space” part and the “space-space”

In our geometric approach the interaction between F ab and Dab as 4D AQs can be written as the sum of two terms,

[1],

(1/2)FabDba = (1/c2)[((Eada) + (Bama))(vbub) − (Eaua)(vbdb) − (Baua)(vbmb)]

+(1/c3)[εabcd(vaEbucmd + c2daubvcBd)]

(2)

As seen from the second term it naturally contains the interaction of Ea with ma, and Ba with da, which are required
for the explanations of the Aharonov-Casher eﬀect and the R¨ontgen phase shift [1,5], and also of diﬀerent methods of
measuring EDMs, e.g., such one as in [6]. Moreover, there is no need for any transformation. We only need to choose
the laboratory frame as our e0-frame and then to represent the AQs Ea, ma and Ba, da in that frame.

Furthermore, it is shown in [7] that the angular momentum four-tensor M ab, M ab = xapb − xbpa (i.e., in [7]
the bivector M = x ∧ p) can be decomposed into the “space-space” angular momentum of the particle La and the
“time-space” angular momentum K a (both with respect to the observer with velocity va)

M ab = (1/c)[(vaK b − vbK a) + εabcdLcvd], La = (1/2c)εabcdMcbvd, K a = (1/c)M bavb,

with Lava = K ava = 0. La and K a depend not only on M ab but also on va. Only in the e0-frame L0 = K 0 = 0 and
Li = (1/2)ε0ijkMjk, K i = M 0i. Li and K i correspond to the components of L and K that are introduced, e.g., in [8].
However Jackson [8], as all others, considers that only L is a physical quantity whose components transform according
y − βK ′
to Eq. (11) in [8], Lx = L′
y); the transformed components Li are expressed
by the mixture of components L′
k. The components of B (and of E) are transformed in the same way, see [9]
Eq. (11.148). It is recently [10] proved that the usual transformations of E, B, [9] Eq. (11.149), are not the Lorentz
transformations (LT) but the “apparent” transformations (AT), which do not refer to the same 4D quantity and
therefore they are not relativistically correct transformations. (For the term AT see [11].) Similarly it is proved in [7]
(and [12]) that the transformations of L, Eq. (11) in [8], and of all other 3D quantities, are also the AT and not the
LT. In our approach, [7], a physical reality is attributed to the whole M ab or, equivalently, to the angular momentums
La and K a, which contain the same physical information as M ab only when they are taken together. Then, e.g.,
the AQ La can be represented as La = Lµeµ = L′µe′
µ, where all primed quantities are the Lorentz transforms of
the unprimed ones. The components Lµ transform by the LT again to the components L′µ (L′0 = γ(L0 − βL1),
L′1 = γ(L1 − βL0), L′2,3 = L2,3, for the boost in the x1 - direction), while the basis eµ transforms by the inverse LT
to e′
µ leaving the whole 4D AQ La unchanged. Diﬀerent representations (relatively moving observers and/or diﬀerent
bases) of La represent the same 4D physical quantity La. All this holds for any 4D AQ, e.g., Ea, Ba, da, ma, etc.

This consideration can be directly applied to the intrinsic angular momentum, the spin of an elementary particle.
In the usual approaches, e.g., [9] Sec. 11.11 A., the relativistic generalization of the spin S from a 3-vector in the
particle’s rest frame is obtained in the following way: “The spin 4-vector Sα is the dual of the tensor Sαβ in the sense
that Sα = (1/2c)εαβγδuβSγδ, where uα is the particle’s 4-velocity.” The whole above discussion about F ab, Dab and
M ab implies a more general geometric formulation of the spin of an elementary particle. In our approach the primary
quantity with the deﬁnite physical reality is the spin four-tensor Sab, which can be decomposed into two 4-vectors,
the usual “space-space” intrinsic angular momentum Sa and the “time-space” intrinsic angular momentum Z a

Sab = (1/c)[(uaZ b − ubZ a) + εabcdScud], Sa = (1/2c)εabcdScbud, Z a = (1/c)Sabua,

(4)

where ua = dxa/dτ is the 4-velocity of the particle and it holds that Saua = Z aua = 0; only three components of Sa
and Z a in any basis are independent. Sa and Z a depend not only on Sab but on ua as well. Only in the particle’s
rest frame, the K ′ frame, and the {e′
jk, Z ′i = S′0i. The
deﬁnition (4) essentially changes the usual understanding of the spin of an elementary particle. It introduces a new
“time-space” spin Z a, which is a physical quantity in the same measure as it is the usual “space-space” spin Sa.

0 and S′0 = Z ′0 = 0, S′i = (1/2c)ε0ijkS′

µ} basis, ua = ce′

In [13] it is asserted: “For an elementary particle, the only intrinsic direction is provided by the spin S. Then
its intrinsic µ = γSS and its intrinsic d = δSS, where δS is a constant.” (In [13] the unprimed quantities are in
the particle’s rest frame.) Thus both the MDM m′ and the EDM d′ (our notation) of an elementary particle are
determined by the usual 3D spin S′. In the usual approaches such result is expected because only the “space-space”
intrinsic angular momentum is considered to be a well-deﬁned physical quantity. However in our geometric approach
a deﬁnite physical reality is attributed to Sab, or to Sa and Z a taken together, see (4). The intrinsic direction in the
3D space is not important in the 4D spacetime since it does not correctly transform under the LT (the boosts).

The whole above consideration suggests that the connection between dipole moments and the spin has to be

formulated in terms of the corresponding 4D geometric quantities as

ma = γSSa, da = δZZ a,

(5)

µ} basis, ua = ce′

where γS and δZ are constants; γS is known but δZ has to be determined from experiments. In the particle’s rest
0 and d′0 = m′0 = 0, d′i = δZZ ′i, m′i = γSS′i. The intrinsic MDM ma of an
frame and the {e′
elementary particle is determined by the “space-space” intrinsic angular momentum Sa, while the intrinsic EDM
da is determined by the “time-space” intrinsic angular momentum Z a. This is a fundamentally new result that is
not earlier mentioned in the literature. This theory cannot predict the magnitude of δZ, but it indicates that more
advanced elementary particle theories will need to change taking into account our relations (4) and (5).

In elementary particle theories the existence of an EDM implies the violation of the time reversal T invariance.
Under the assumption of CPT invariance a nonzero EDM would also signal CP violation. As said in [14]: “it is the T
violation associated with EDMs that makes the experimental hunt interesting.” Let us brieﬂy consider the connection
between the EDM and the T invariance. Reversing time would reverse the spin direction but leave the EDM direction

3

unchanged (the charge distribution does not change). Thus, with t → −t, S → −S, but d → d. However, as in [13],
d is determined as d = dS/S. Hence d has to be parallel to the spin S; it is considered that S is the only available
vector in the rest frame of the particle. This leads that d → −d, i.e., d → 0. As stated in [14]: “the alignment of spin
and EDM is what leads to violations of T and P .”

From the viewpoint of our geometric approach neither T inversion nor P inversion are well-deﬁned in the 4D
spacetime; they are not good symmetries. For the position 4-vector as an AQ xa only the world parity W (for the
term see, e.g., [15]), according to which xa → −xa, is well-deﬁned in the 4D spacetime. In general, the W inversion
cannot be written as the product of T and P inversions. But this will be possible for the representations of W , T
and P in the standard basis {eµ}. It is easy to see that, e.g., T inversion is not well-deﬁned and that it depends,
for example, on the chosen synchronization. (In [16] two very diﬀerent, but completely equivalent synchronizations,
Einstein’s synchronization and a drastically diﬀerent, nonstandard, radio (“r”) synchronization, are exposed and
exploited throughout the paper. The “r” synchronization is commonly used in everyday life and not Einstein’s
synchronization. In the “r” synchronization there is an absolute simultaneity. As explained in [17]: “For if we turn
on the radio and set our clock by the standard announcement ”...“at the sound of the last tone, it will be 12 o’clock,”
then we have synchronized our clock with the studio clock according to the “r” synchronization.) The unit 4-vectors
in the {eµ} basis and the basis {rµ} with the “r” synchronization , [16], are connected as r0 = e0, ri = e0 + ei, while
the components of xa are connected as x0
r = xi. It is clear that T inversion, t → −t, does
not give that x0
r → −x0
r, which means that T inversion is not physical. In general the same holds for P inversion.
However W inversion is properly deﬁned since when xµ → −xµ then necessarily xµ
r . This is one of the reason
why, contrary to the existing elementary particle theories, the T violation, i.e., the CP violation, cannot be connected
in our approach with the existence of an intrinsic EDM. Furthermore, as already said, neither the direction of d nor
the direction of the spin S have a well-deﬁned meaning in the 4D spacetime. The only Lorentz invariant condition on
the directions of da and Sa in the 4D spacetime is daua = Saua = 0. This condition does not say that d has to be
parallel to the spin S. The above discussion additionally proves that our relations (5) are properly deﬁned.

r = x0 − x1 − x2 − x3, xi

r → −xµ

The obtained results will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the interpretations of measurements of an EDM of a fundamental
particle, e.g., [6], [14], [18]. In all experimental searches for a permanent electric dipole moment of particles the AT
of E and B are frequently used and considered to be relativistically correct; i.e., that they are the LT of E and
B. Thus, in a recent new method of measuring electric dipole moments in storage rings [6] the so-called motional
electric ﬁeld, our E′, is considered to arise “according to a Lorentz transformation” from a vertical magnetic ﬁeld B
that exists in the laboratory frame; E′ = γcβ × B. That ﬁeld E′ plays a decisive role in the mentioned new method
of measuring EDMs. It is stated in [6] that E′ “can be much larger than any practical applied electric ﬁeld.” and
“Its action on the particle supplies the radial centripetal force.” Then, after introducing “g-2” frequency ωa, due
to the action of the magnetic ﬁeld on the muon magnetic moment, they say: “If there is an EDM of magnitude
d = ηhe/4mc ≃ η × 4.7 × 10−14ecm, there will be an additional precession angular frequency ωe = (ηe/2m)β × B
about the direction of E′, ... .” The new technique of measuring EDM in [6] is to cancel ωa so that ωe can operate
by itself. An important remark to such treatment is that the ﬁeld E′ is in the rest frame of the particle K ′ but the
measurement of EDM is in the laboratory frame K. Similarly happens in [18] and many others in which ’motional
magnetic ﬁeld’ B′ = (γ/c)E × β appears in the particle’s rest frame as a result of the AT of the E ﬁeld from the
It is usually considered that (γ/c)E × β ﬁeld causes important systematic errors. Thus, it is stated,
laboratory.
already in the abstract, in the ﬁrst paper in [18]: “In order to achieve the target sensitivies it will be necessary
to deal with the systematic error resulting from the interaction of the well-known v × E ﬁeld with magnetic ﬁeld
gradients .. . This interaction produces a frequency shift linear in the electric ﬁeld, mimicking an EDM.” The same
interpretation with the AT of E and B appears when the quantum phase of a moving dipole is considered, e.g., [19].
For example, when the R¨ontgen phase shift is considered then it is asserted in the second paper in [19] that in “the
particle rest frame the magnetic ﬂux density B due to the magnetic line is perceived as an electric ﬁeld” E′ = v × B.
Then that E′ can interact with d′ in K ′. In the usual approaches with the 3-vectors it is also possible to get the
interaction between B and d in another way, which is more conforming to a description in K. According to that
way the magnetic ﬁeld B in K interacts with the MDM m that is obtained from EDM d′ by the AT for m and d;
m = γv × d′
. (For the Aharonov-Casher eﬀect that another way is mentioned in [20].) However, as already said, the
transformations of E and B, and of d and m, are not the LT but the AT, [10]. They have to be replaced by the LT of
the corresponding 4D geometric quantities. Then, the LT transform Bµ from K again to B′µ in K ′ and similarly Eµ
from K is transformed again to E′µ in K ′; there is no mixing of components. The same holds for the LT of dµ and
mµ. Thus, in our approach, there is no induced E′ as in [6] and [19], and there is no ’motional magnetic ﬁeld’ B′ as
in [18] and [20], and there is no induced d in K as in [20]. As already said, it is seen from the second term in (2) that
we have the direct interaction between the magnetic ﬁeld Ba and an EDM da, which is required for the explanation
of measurements in [6]. In order to describe that interaction in K we only need to choose the laboratory frame as our
e0-frame and then to represent the AQs Ba and da in that frame. For the phase shifts these questions are discussed
in [1] and [5]. Accordingly, the experimentalists who search for an EDM, e.g., [6], [18], and, for example, those who

4

observe the Aharonov-Casher phase shift [21], will need to reexamine the results of their measurements taking into
account our relations (2), (4) and (5).

In conclusion, we believe that the new results (4) and (5) that are obtained in this paper, together with the
expression (2) for the interaction term, [1], will greatly inﬂuence diﬀerent branches of physics, particularly elementary
particle theories and experiments, and also theories and experiments that treat diﬀerent quantum phase shifts with
dipoles.

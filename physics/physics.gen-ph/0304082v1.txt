Abstract

The conditions under which, the continuity equation can be sub-
stituted by an ordinary non diﬀerential equation, will be discussed.
Since continuity equation is a fundamental equation, this result will
be applicable in a vast area of Physics.

1 introduction

In 2002 the author devised a method for solving nonlinear diﬀerential equa-

tions[1]. Using this method one can solve many important non linear diﬀer-

ential equations in physics.

In an endeavor to solve hydrodynamical equations governing the interstellar

media, we came to a very important result about continuity equation. This

result helped us to ﬁnd exact solutions for hydrodynamical equations in an

straightforward and simple way.

In the following section we will write the result in the form of a theorem. Al-

though we have come to the result using the new method, but in proving the

theorem we do not use our method. what we will do is simply substituting

the driven result in continuity equation.

For all density and velocity Functions in the Form, ρ = ρ(G(f (x, y, z, t)))

and

−→
v =

−→
v (G(f (x, y, z, t))) the continuity equation, ∂ρ

∂t + ∇.(ρ

−→
v ) = 0 can

be written as an ordinary equation if, f (x, y, z, t) = αx + βy + γz + λt.

Here G(f ) is any arbitrary function of f .

Proof:

According to the stated conditions, Continuity equation can be written as,

As a result we will have,

Integrating from both sides of the above equation will result in;

c is a constant of integration and

Therefore in these cases we can always write ρ in terms of

3 discussion

Although very simple, we believe that this result is an important result;

Firstly, because we used this to ﬁnd out explicit solution for Naiver stokes

equations in cases that had not been solved previously(2). secondly, there is

always a probability that, from explicit solutions one may come to physical

results that could not be driven out from numerical analysis. At present,

those who are concerned with nonlinear physical applications, containing

continuity equation, use numerical methods for describing diﬀerent physical

phenomena. One may check out the above result for new out comes.

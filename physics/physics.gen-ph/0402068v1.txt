Abstract

hSsti

The quantum mechanics is considered to be a partial case of the stochastic
system dynamics. It is shown that the wave function describes the state of
statistically averaged system
, but not that of the individual stochastic
system
It is a common practice to think that such a construction of
quantum mechanics contains hidden variables, and it is incompatible with
the von Neumann’s theorem on hidden variables. It is shown that the original
conditions of the von Neumann’s theorem are not satisﬁed.
In particular,
the quantum mechanics cannot describe the particle momentum distribution.
The distribution w (p) =
is not a particle momentum distribution at
the state ψ, because it cannot be attributed to a wave function. It is closer
to the mean momentum distribution, although the two distributions do not
coincide exactly.

1 Introduction

E

In the present paper we consider the quantum mechanics as a special case of the
stochastic systems dynamics [1]. The dynamics of stochastic systems describes any
stochastic systems, but not only the quantum ones, and dynamics of stochastic sys-
tems cannot be founded on the principles of quantum mechanics, which are speciﬁc
only for description of the nonrelativistic quantum phenomena.
In the stochas-
tic system dynamics the quantum principles appear only on the dynamical level
as dynamic properties of quantum systems. The stochastic system dynamics is a
usual statistical conception, which contains two sorts of objects: (1) the individual

mechanics considered to be a special case of the stochastic systems dynamics. The
conventional quantum mechanics will be referred to as the axiomatic conception of
quantum phenomena (ACQP). These abbreviations will be used for brevity.

In MCQP the hydrodynamic interpretation of quantum mechanics is considered
to be a primary interpretation, and the conventional interpretation in terms of the
wave function appears to be a secondary (derivative) interpretation. Such an ap-
proach has a logical foundation, and we shall present it. Besides, MCQP and the
hydrodynamic interpretation of quantum mechanics can be easily expanded onto the
relativistic quantum phenomena, because MCQP takes into account the quantum
speciﬁc only on the dynamical level. To describe the relativistic phenomena, it is
suﬃcient to consider relativistic Lagrangian of

.

In ACQP the quantum speciﬁc is taken into account on the conceptual level. The
wave function (the main object of ACQP) is nonrelativistic, and transition to the
relativistic phenomena description is connected with a revision of the conceptual
structure of ACQP. Attempts of uniﬁcation of the nonrelativistic QM technique
with the relativity principles failed. At any rate, the expansion of conventional
interpretation in terms of the wave function meets with diﬃculties. As a result of
these diﬃculties the collision of relativistic particles is described only in terms of
the S-matrix, because the detailed description of the collision process in terms of
the wave function appears to be impossible. In particular, one cannot describe in
terms of the wave function the details of the pair production mechanism [2].

Note that MCQP may be considered to be a theory with hidden variables. It
is believed that the quantum theory with hidden variables is impossible, because

2

according to the von Neumann’s theorem on hidden variables [3] (chp.4, sec. 1,2)
it is incompatible with the conventional conception of quantum mechanics. The
mathematical formalism of ACQP and, in particular, the theorem of von Neumann
on hidden variables are founded on the following statement.

that any observable quantity

valid for all observable quantities
formula (1.1) is valid not for all quantities

cannot be founded, and the theorem on hidden variables appears to be unproved.

We are going to show that the formula (1.1) is not valid in the case, when
i¯h∇ is the momentum
R = F (p), where F is an arbitrary function and p =
operator. In particular, the measurement of the momentum of a free particle needs
a long time. During this time the wave function ψ of the particle changes essentially,
and the measured value p′ of the momentum cannot be attributed to any deﬁnite
state (wave function). As a result the formula (1.1) is not satisﬁed for such a quantity
as the particle momentum.

In the present paper we show two points:

1. The quantum mechanical technique describes dynamics of statistical ensembles

2. The distribution (1.2) disagrees with the von Neumann’s postulate (1.1).

2 Whose state does the wave function describe?

The fact, that the Schr¨odinger equation for the free quantum particle may be written
in the form of the hydrodynamic equations, describing an irrotational ﬂow of some
ﬂuid, was known long ago [5, 6]. Representation of the Schr¨odinger equation in
the form of hydrodynamic equation for the ideal (quantum) ﬂuid with the internal
energy

E =

(∇ρ)2

¯h2
8mρ

(2.1)

known as the hydrodynamic interpretation of quantum mechanics, was used by many
authors [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Here ρ is the ﬂuid density, m is the
mass of the quantum particle, E = E (ρ, ∇ρ) is the internal energy of the ﬂuid per
unit mass, and ¯h is the quantum constant.

Hydrodynamic description was used mainly as an interpretation of quantum me-
chanics, but not as a method of the quantum particle description, because the hydro-
dynamic equations are nonlinear and more diﬃcult for solution, than the Schr¨odinger
equation. On the other hand, the hydrodynamic interpretation is more demonstra-
tive, than the conventional interpretation in terms of the wave function.

Although the connection between the Schr¨odinger equation and the hydrody-
namic description was known for many years, all this time it was the one-way con-
nection. One could obtain the irrotational ﬂuid ﬂow from the dynamic equation for
the wave function (Schr¨odinger equation), but one did not know how to transform
dynamic equations for a ﬂuid to the dynamic equation for a wave function. In other
words, we did not know how to describe rotational ﬂuid ﬂow in terms of the wave
function.
In terms of the wave function we could describe only irrotational ﬂuid
ﬂow.

To describe an arbitrary ﬂuid ﬂow in terms of a wave function, one needs to
integrate conventional dynamic equations for a ﬂuid (Euler equations). Indeed, the
Schr¨odinger equation

∂ψ
∂t

¯h2

may be reduced to the hydrodynamic equations for the density ρ and the velocity
v of some ideal (quantum) ﬂuid. Substituting ψ = √ρ exp (i¯hϕ) in (2.2) and sepa-
rating real and imaginary parts of the equation, we obtain expressions for the time
derivatives ∂0ρ and ∂0ϕ. To obtain expression for the time derivative ∂0v of the
∇ϕ, we need to diﬀerentiate the dynamic equation for ∂0ϕ, forming

equations to the dynamic equations for the wave function (Schr¨odinger equation)
needs a general integration of hydrodynamic equations. This integration is simple in
the partial case of the irrotational ﬂow, but it is a rather complicated mathematical
problem in the general case, when the result of integration has to contain three arbi-
trary functions of three arguments. Without producing this integration, one cannot
derive a description of a ﬂuid in terms of the wave function, and one cannot manip-
ulate the dynamic equations, transforming them from the representation in terms
of ρ, v to the representation in terms of the wave function and back. This problem
has not been solved for years. Now it has been solved. It has been shown that any
ideal ﬂuid can be described in terms of a many-component complex wave function.
The irrotational ﬂow of the ideal ﬂuid is described by the one-component wave func-
tion, whereas the rotational ﬂow is described by the two-component wave function
(or even by the many-component one) [16]. It means that the wave function and
the spin are attributes of the ideal ﬂuid description (but not those of the quantum
principles). In other words, the wave function is only a way of description of the
quantum ﬂuid, whereas the properties of the quantum phenomena are determined
by the quantum ﬂuid itself, whose properties are determined in turn by its internal
energy. It means that the quantum ﬂuid is a real vehicle of quantum properties, but
not the wave function, which is simply a way of the ideal ﬂuid description.

Another interesting question: ”Why does one need to transform the scale of the

where ρ = ψ∗ψ, ψ is a complex one-component wave function, ψ∗ is the quantity
complex conjugate to ψ. The quantity b0 is an arbitrary (integration) constant (b0 6
=
0), describing the scale of the wave function phase. The last term of (2.8) describes
the internal energy of the ﬂuid. Only this term contains the quantum constant ¯h.
All other terms are dynamical terms which are present at the description of any
nonrelativistic statistical ensemble. Dynamic equation generated by the action (2.8)
is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation for any choice of the constant b0. If we
set ¯h = 0, the last term in (2.8) vanishes, the internal energy of the ﬂuid becomes
E (ρ, ∇ρ) = 0. In this case the action (2.8) describes the statistical ensemble of
classical (deterministic) particles
Sd. Thus, in the action (2.8) the transition to the
classical case is obtained by setting ¯h = 0.
Formal variation of the action (2.8) with respect to ψ∗ leads to the dynamic
equation for ψ, which is nonlinear because of two last terms in (2.8). If we chose the
integration constant b0 = ¯h, two last terms compensate each other and the action
(2.8) turns to the action

which generates the Schr¨odinger equation (2.2) directly. But now all terms of the
action (2.9) are quantum in the sense that they contain the quantum constant ¯h
as a factor. Setting ¯h = 0, we cannot transit now to the classical case, because at
¯h = 0 the action (2.9) vanishes. However, we can transform the phase scale of ψ by

Sst]) is considered.

Such an interpretation is in accordance with the quantum mechanical technique,
which deals with only one sort of particles
Sst], and all quantum mechanical

ments: (1) the single measurement (S-measurement) produced under an individ-
ual particle and (2) the massive measurement (M-measurement) produced under
a statistical ensemble. Properties of S-measurement and those of M-measurement
are discrepant and incompatible. The result of the S-measurement is a deﬁnite
value of the measured quantity, whereas the result of the M-measurement is a dis-
tribution of the measured quantity. The result of the S-measurement is random
and irreproducible, whereas the result of the M-measurement is regular and repro-
ducible. The S-measurement does not change the state (wave function), whereas
the M-measurement replaces the wave function ψ by the density matrix.
If we
do not distinguish between the M-measurement and S-measurement and use one
term ”measurement” for the two kinds of measurement, it is a source of possible
paradoxes [1].

Unfortunately, we have not met such a presentation of the quantum mechanics,
where two kinds of measurements be considered. Such a distinction between two
kinds of measurements is necessary, if we consider the quantum mechanics as a spe-
cial case of the general statistical conception (dynamics of stochastic systems). We
have not met such a distinction between S-measurement and M-measurement even
in the presentation of those authors, who believe that the wave function describes
the state of the statistical ensemble (but not of a single particle). The presenta-
tion of quantum mechanics cannot be consistent without this distinction. Besides,
any M-measurement is a set of many S-measurements, and one may not ignore
S-measurement, although its results are not described by the QM formalism.

The quantum mechanics is a logical construction which contains axioms (pri-
mary statements) and corollaries of these axioms. The primary statements can be
chosen in diﬀerent way, and interpretation of quantum mechanics depends on this
choice. This choice is unessential for the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in itself,
but it is essential, if we are going to expand the quantum mechanics onto the rel-
ativistic quantum phenomena. For instance, if the quantum principles are primary
statements of the quantum mechanics, then dynamic equations in terms of the wave

function must be linear, and the internal energy of the quantum ﬂuid must have the
form (2.1), in order the last term of (2.8) may be compensated with the antecedent
term at ¯h = b0. Any other form of the internal energy ﬂuid is unallowable. Compen-
sation of the dynamical term with the term describing some special ﬂuid property
looks rather artiﬁcial. It is justiﬁed only by the intention to obtain the linear dy-
namic equation. From the point of view of the stochastic system dynamics, where
all ideal ﬂuids are admissible, the consideration of the dynamic equation linearity as
a principle of the logical construction seems to be rather doubtful. Of course, if for
some special quantum ﬂuid we can obtain the linear dynamic equation, be it even
an artiﬁcial identiﬁcation of the terms of diﬀerent nature, we should accept and use
this identiﬁcation. But it seems doubtful to consider the linearity connected with
such an identiﬁcation as a principle of the quantum mechanics.

Besides, the action for the quantum ﬂuid with internal energy (2.1) has the form
(2.8) only for irrotational ﬂow of the ﬂuid. The wave function ψ is two-component
at the rotational ﬂow of the same ﬂuid, and the action has the form [16]

This equation is nonlinear, and one can hardly reduce it to a linear equation. Then
the equation (2.13) is incompatible with principles of the quantum mechanics.

Being considered as a principle, the linearity of the dynamic equation restricts
strongly capacity of the stochastic system dynamics. In particular, attempts of ex-
pansion of the quantum mechanics on relativistic phenomena of microcosm failed,
and the constraints imposed on the dynamics of the stochastic systems by the quan-
tum mechanics principles may play an essential role in this failure.

In the conventional (Copenhagen) interpretation of quantum mechanics the quan-
tum particle motion is described in terms of the wave function ψ and related con-
cepts:
interference, diﬀraction, coherence. Such concepts as momentum, energy,
angular momentum are used also, but they are expressed via the wave function
ψ, and their sense is sometimes another, than in the classical mechanics. But the
wave function ψ is a nonrelativistic concept, and the conventional interpretation

The quantum constant ¯h appears here as a coupling constant, describing connection
between the regular and stochastic components of the particle motion. The velocity
u is supposed to be small with respect to c. Dynamic equations for the quantum
ﬂuid with the pressure are obtained as a result of variation of the action (2.19) with
respect to variables x and u. It follows from the dynamic equation for u that

generates a pressure in the quantum ﬂuid.
Quantization of free relativistic classical particles is carried out by means of the
relativistic version of the change (2.18) [16, 19]. Sometimes a puzzling question
arises: ”How can the quantum ﬂuid describe such wave phenomena as interference
and diﬀraction?” The fact is that the pressure and the internal energy of the quan-
tum ﬂuid depend on the density ρ and on the density gradient ∇ρ, whereas in
the usual ﬂuid they depend only on the density ρ. Appearance of additional spa-
tial derivatives in the hydrodynamic equations generates the wave properties of the
quantum ﬂuid. Formally it follows from the description of the irrotational ﬂow of
quantum ﬂuid in terms of the Schr¨odinger equation.

3 The momentum distribution

Hydrodynamic interpretation of quantum mechanics cannot give distribution w (p)
over momenta p at the state, described by the wave function ψ. It can give only
the mean momentum distribution. The conventional (Copenhagen) interpretation
gives the momentum distribution by the relation

w (p) = Aψ∗

where ψp is the Fourier component of the wave function ψ. But this statement
cannot be tested experimentally, because the measured distribution cannot be at-
tributed to the state ψ (x). On the contrary, the mean momentum distribution,
which is given by the hydrodynamic interpretation, can be tested experimentally
and attributed to the wave function ψ, but this distribution does not coincide with
(3.1).

To realize the diﬀerence between the momentum and the mean momentum, we
consider the measurement of the molecule momentum in the example of the sta-
tionary ﬂow of an ideal gas. Let the gas ﬂow be isothermal, and the temperature
kT =const. Distribution of the gas molecules over velocities is described by the
Maxwell distribution

forms the mean momentum distribution. This distribution is determined completely
by the gas ﬂow, and it has nothing to do with the Maxwell momentum distribution
(3.3), which describes both the regular and random components of the molecule mo-
menta. Under conditions (3.4) the mean momentum distribution is much narrower,
than the Maxwell distribution, because the Maxwell distribution takes into account
the random component of the molecule velocity, and in the given case the random
component is much larger, than the regular one. Let us imagine that we measure
the momentum of the accidentally taken molecule. We measure its position x at the

Producing many such measurements of the molecule momentum, we obtain the
momentum distribution. What distribution do we obtain? The mean momentum
distribution, or the Maxwell distribution? The result depends on the measurement

If the gas ﬂow is nonstationary, the measurement time tm must be shorter, than

The distribution (3.7) can be measured in a very short measurement time tm and
attributed to some state ψ of the ﬂuid, but this distribution has not the form (1.1),
because it is not bilinear with respect to the wave function ψ. The distribution (3.1)
also has not the form (1.1), because it cannot be attributed to the wave function ψ.
In general, the distribution (3.7) distinguishes from the conventional momentum
distribution (3.1). Let us compare the two distributions for the state, described by
the wave function

Expressions (3.15) and (3.12) coincide in the limit a

¯h/k. Thus, distributions (3.15) and (3.12) are close for the wide wave pack-
a
ets. In other cases the distributions (3.15) and (3.12) may be close or not. Both
interpretations (conventional and hydrodynamic) assume that simultaneous distri-
bution over position and momenta is impossible. (Formally, such a distribution is
possible, but in this distribution the momentum p is a function of the position x).
But reasons of this impossibility are diﬀerent. The conventional interpretation sup-
poses that such a distribution is impossible, because the position operator and the
momentum operator do not commute. In the hydrodynamic interpretation such a
distribution is impossible, because the position and the mean momentum are not
independent quantities.

Let us consider the inﬂuence of the measuring device on the momentum mea-
surement in the stationary state described by the wave function ψ. We measure the
component p1 of the momentum p in the interval

.

At ﬁrst, we present the viewpoint of ACQP, which does not distinguish between
the M-measurement and S-measurement. We consider the momentum measurement
as an measurement under individual particle. We measure the particle coordinate
x twice with the time interval tm between them. For determination of the particle
position, we use a photon of frequency ω with the momentum ¯hω/c. At the collision
with the particle the photon transmits a portion of its momentum to the particle.
Indeterminacy ∆p of the momentum is connected with the indeterminacy ∆x of the
particle position by means of the indeterminacy relation

x, x + ∆x
}

{

Measurement of the ﬁrst position of the particle is carried out by the indeterminacy
∆x. The momentum is determined by the relation (3.5), and the indeterminacy δp
of the momentum measurement is a function of ∆x, deﬁned by the relation

Thus, the exact measurement of the momentum is possible only at tm → ∞
, when
the measured value of the momentum cannot be attributed to any value of the wave
function. Impossibility of the exact measurement of particle momentum is connected
with inﬂuence of the measuring device (in the given case with the photon inﬂuence).
Now we consider the momentum measurement from the viewpoint of MCQP,
which distinguishes between the S-measurement and the M-measurement. Consid-
eration of the S-measurement is useless, because the result of the S-measurement

predicted by the statistical conception (quantum mechanics).

The M-measurement is a set (statistical ensemble) of N similar independent S-
measurements: M1, M2, ..., MN (N

under a single particle. All particles are prepared in the same way, and all N

exists and coincides with the value of mvx, determined by the second relation of
(3.7). The measured value
of the mean momentum may be attributed to
the state ψ (but not to ψ′), because the time of the measurement can be made to
be very short. The state ψ′ may be considered to be an intermediate state, which
appears in the process of the M-measurement. The quantum mechanics formalism
predicts the value of (3.20) and attributes it to the wave function ψ. However, the
QM formalism cannot predict the form of the distribution (3.19), as well as the gas
dynamics can describe the gas velocity (the mean molecular velocity), but the gas
dynamics formalism does not describe the Maxwell distribution and its evolution. In
this sense the parameters of the distribution (3.19) may be considered to be hidden
parameters of ACQP. They are also hidden parameters of MCQP.

In a sense the momentum distribution (3.19) is an analog of the Maxwell mo-
mentum distribution (3.3) in the kinetic gas theory. Is it possible to measure this
momentum distribution experimentally? Is it possible to eliminate inﬂuence of the
measuring device on the measurement of the momentum distribution? It is an in-
teresting question, which is open now.

4 Concluding remarks

At ﬁrst sight the conventional interpretation seems to be more informative, than
the hydrodynamic interpretation, because the ACQP predicts the momentum dis-
tribution, whereas MCQP cannot. We show in this paper that the momentum
distribution (1.3) is not a momentum distribution in reality. It may be considered
to be the Fourier component module distribution, or even the mean momentum
distribution, but it is not the momentum distribution. If it is so, the hydrodynamic
interpretation, which cannot predict the momentum distribution, appears to be as
informative as the conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Besides it was shown that the wave function describes the state of the statistical

It has been shown that some of original basic statements (1.1), which are nec-
essary for the proof of the von Neumann’s theorem on hidden variables cannot be
tested experimentally, because the measured values cannot be attributed to a def-
inite state (wave function). All these arguments attest in favour of hydrodynamic
interpretation, which can be freely expanded to the case of relativistic phenomena.

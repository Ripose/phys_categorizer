It is shown that the spin of the π0, η, Λ, Σ±,0, Ξ−,0, Λ+
c mesons and
baryons can be explained by the sum of the angular momentum vectors and the
spin vectors of the electromagnetic waves which are in these particles according to
the standing wave model. The spin of the π±, K±,0, D±,0, and D±
S mesons and of
the neutron is the sum of the angular momentum vectors of the oscillations and
of the spin vectors of the neutrinos and the electric charges which are in the cubic
lattice of these particles. Spin 1/2 is the consequence of the superposition of two
perpendicular standing waves of equal frequencies and amplitudes shifted in phase
by π/2.

Introduction

The spin or the intrinsic angular momentum is, after the mass, the second
most important property of the elementary particles. As is well-known the
spin of the electron was discovered by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit [1] more
than 75 years ago. Later on it was established that the baryons have spin
as well, but not the mesons. An explanation of the spin of the particles has
sofar not been found. Biedenharn and Louck [2] state on p. 5 that, contrary
to widespread perceptions, “internal angular momentum is a classical, non-
relativistic concept” and that “spin 1/2 internal angular momentum is also a
classical nonrelativistic ﬁeld-theoretic concept”. The concept that spin 1/2 is
a relativistic eﬀect originates from Dirac’s equation. However, since electrons
with practically zero velocity still have spin it is hard to see how spin 1/2 can
be a relativistic eﬀect. It is also diﬃcult to see how the spin of a particle can
be explained without consideration of the structure of the particle. Actually
it appears to be crucial for the validity of a model of the elementary particles
that the model can also explain the spin of the particles without additional
assumptions. The standard model of the particles cannot explain the spin
because the spin is imposed on the quarks. For current eﬀorts to understand

the spin of the nucleon see Jaﬀe [3]. We will show that the spin of the parti-
cles can be explained by the sum of the angular momentum vectors and the
spin vectors of the waves and neutrinos and electric charges in the mesons
and baryons.

We will now look at the spin as a property of the standing waves in the
cubic lattice of the particles which we have described in [4]. We cannot
repeat the points made there. May it suﬃce to mention that we showed
in [4] that the spectrum of the so-called stable mesons and baryons consist
of a gamma-branch with the π0, η, Λ, Σ0, Ξ0, Ω−, Λ+
c particles
and a neutrino branch with the π±, K±,0, n, D±,0, and D±
S particles, as
follows clearly from the decays of the particles. We have also shown that
the masses of the particles of the γ-branch can be explained by standing
electromagnetic waves in a cubic cavity. The standing waves come with a
continuum of frequencies which must be in the particles after a high energy
collision or according to Fourier analysis. The masses of the particles so
determined agree on the average within 0.66% with the experimentally found
mass ratios of the γ-branch particles. The particles of the neutrino branch
consist of cubic neutrino lattices. The energy in the ν-branch particles is the
energy of the lattice oscillations plus the energy in the rest masses of the
neutrinos.

It is striking that the particles which consist of a single oscillation mode
do not have spin, as the π0, π± and η mesons do, see Tables 1 and 2. The
modes in these tables are improved versions of the modes in Tables 1 and 4
in [4], in which the consequences of electrical charge on the structure of the
particles were not considered. It is also striking that particles whose mass is
approximately twice the mass of a smaller particle have spin 1/2 as is the case
with the Λ baryon, m(Λ) ≈ 2m(η), and with the nucleon m(n) ≈ 2m(K±) ≈
2m(K0). The Ξ0
c baryon which is a doublet of one mode has also spin 1/2.
Composite particles which consist of a doublet of one mode plus one or two
other single modes have spin 1/2, as the Σ0, Ξ0 and Λ+
c baryons do.
The only particle with a triplet of a single mode, the Ω− baryon, has spin
3/2. It appears that the relation between the spin and the oscillation modes
of the particles is straightforward.

standing electromagnetic waves, each with its own frequency. The oscilla-
tions in the photon lattice are longitudinal. All standing longitudinal waves
of frequency νi in the π0 and η mesons do not have angular momentum or
Pi j(νi) = 0, with the index running from 1 to N. Longitudinal lattice oscil-
lations cannot cause an intrinsic angular momentum because for longitudinal
oscillations ~r × ~p = 0.

Each of the standing electromagnetic waves in the π0 and η mesons may,
on the other hand, have spin s = 1 of its own, because circularly polarized
electromagnetic waves have an angular momentum as was ﬁrst suggested by
Poynting [5] and veriﬁed by, among others, Allen [6]. The creation of the
π0 meson in the reaction γ + p → π0 + p and conservation of angular mo-
mentum dictate that the sum of the angular momentum vectors of the N
electromagnetic waves in the π0 meson is zero, Pi j(si) = 0. Either the sum
of the spin vectors of the electromagnetic waves in the π0 meson is zero, or
each electromagnetic wave in the π0 meson has zero spin. That would mean
that they are linearly polarized. Linearly polarized electromagnetic waves
are not expected to have angular momentum. That this is actually so was
proven by Allen [6] who speciﬁcally states that “a wave linearly polarized
to the [receiving] dipole” and “a wave linearly polarized perpendicular to
the dipole” does “in neither instance ... exert a torque on the dipole”, which
means that these waves do not have angular momentum, whereas “the dipole
will experience a torque” when the “wave is circularly polarized” and con-
sequently the wave has angular momentum. Since the standing longitudinal
photon oscillations in the π0 and η mesons do not have angular momentum
and since the sum of the spin vectors si of the electromagnetic waves must
be zero, the intrinsic angular momentum of the π0 and η mesons is zero, or

(j(νi) + j(si)) = 0

(1 ≤ i ≤ N) .

In the standing wave model the π0 and η mesons do not have intrinsic angular
momentum or spin, in agreement with the experimental facts.

We now consider particles such as the Λ baryon which consist of su-
perpositions of two perpendicular standing waves of equal frequencies and
amplitudes shifted in phase by π/2 at each of the N points of the lattice [4].
The oscillations in the particles are then coupled what we have marked in
Tables 1,2 by the · sign. The particles then contain N circular waves, each
with its own frequency and each having an angular momentum of ¯h/2 as we
will see.

The superposition of two perpendicular linearly polarized traveling waves
of equal amplitudes and frequencies shifted in phase by π/2 leads to a circular
wave with the constant angular momentum j = ¯h. The total energy of such
a wave is the sum of the potential and the kinetic energy. If the motion is
circular the kinetic energy is always equal to the potential energy. From

follows

Epot + Ekin = Etot = ¯hω ,

Etot = 2Ekin = 2

= ¯hω,

j = Θω = ¯h .

with the moment of inertia Θ. It follows that the angular momentum j is

This applies for one single circular oscillation and corresponds to spin s = 1,
or to a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave.

We now add to one monochromatic standing oscillation with frequency ω
a perpendicular second standing oscillation with the same frequency shifted
in phase by π/2, having the same amplitude, as we have done before in [7].
In other words we consider the oscillations

x(t) = exp[iωt] + exp[− i(ωt + π)] ,

y(t) = exp[i(ωt + π/2)] + exp[− i(ωt + 3π/2)] .

If we replace i in Eqs. (5,6) by − i we have a circular wave turning in opposite
direction. The energy of the superposition of the two waves is the sum of the
energies of both individual waves, so according to Eq.(2) we have

from which follows that the standing circular wave has an angular momentum

4Ekin = 4Θω2/2 = Etot = ¯hω ,

j = Θω = ¯h/2 .

The superposition of two perpendicular monochromatic standing waves of
equal amplitudes and frequencies shifted in phase by π/2 satisﬁes the neces-
sary condition for spin s = 1/2 that the angular momentum is j = ¯h/2.

The standing wave model of the mesons and baryons treats the Λ baryon,
which has spin s = 1/2 and a mass m(Λ) = 1.0190 · 2m(η), as the superposi-
tion of two particles of the same type with N standing electromagnetic waves.
The waves are circular because they are the superposition of two standing
waves with the same frequency and amplitude shifted in phase by π/2. The
angular momentum vectors around a center axis of all circular waves in the
lattice cancel, except for the wave at the center of the crystal, because for
each oscillation with frequency ω there is at its mirror position a wave with
the frequency − ω, which consequently has a negative angular momentum
since j = mr2ω. Oscillations with negative frequencies are permitted solu-
tions in cubic isotropic lattices.

The frequency distribution of the axial longitudinal oscillations of a cubic
lattice has to be corrected for the limitation of the group velocity to the value
of the velocity of light. The oscillation frequencies are then given, according
to [4], by

ν = ν0φ = c φ/2πa ,
(9)
with φ = 2πa/λ, the lattice constant a = 10−16 cm, the wavelength λ, and
the velocity of light c. Since φ goes from − π to π there is for each positive
frequency a negative frequency of the same absolute value at − φ. Conse-
quently the angular momentum vectors of all circular waves in the lattice
cancel, but for the wave at the center of the lattice, whose frequency seems
to be zero according to Eq.(9). This is a misleading result of the assumption
of an inﬁnite extension of the crystal introduced by the periodic boundary
conditions used in the classic theory of lattice oscillations. The frequency at
φ = 0 is ν(0) = c/2d, where d is the distance between two opposite sides of
the crystal, d ≈ 103 a. As for all circular oscillations in the lattice the wave
at the center is also the superposition of two perpendicular standing waves
and has an angular momentum of ¯h/2 according to Eq.(8). This is the only
one of the waves whose angular momentum is not canceled. The net angular
momentum of the N lattice oscillations which are the superpositions of two
perpendicular standing waves is therefore ¯h/2. Since the circular standing
waves in the Λ baryon lattice are the only possible contribution to an angular
momentum the intrinsic angular momentum of the Λ baryon is ¯h/2 or

j(Λ) = X
i

j(νi) = ¯h/2 .

We have thus explained that the Λ and likewise the Ξ0

The other particles of the γ-branch, the Σ0, Ξ0, Λ+

are composites of a baryon with spin 1/2 plus one or two π mesons which do
not have spin. Consequently the spin of these particles is 1/2. The spin of
all particles of the γ-branch, exempting the spin of the Ω− baryon, has thus
been explained.

2 The spin of the particles of the ν-branch

The characteristic particles of the neutrino-branch are the π± mesons which
have zero spin. At ﬁrst glance it seems to be odd that the π± mesons do not
have spin, because it seems that the π± mesons should have spin 1/2 from
the spin of the charges e± in π±. However that is not the case. The solution
of this puzzle is in the composition of the π± mesons which are, according
to the standing wave model, made of a lattice of neutrinos and antineutrinos
(Fig. 1), each having spin 1/2, whereas the π0 meson is made of standing
electromagnetic waves which are linearly polarized and do not have spin.

Fig. 1: The neutrino lattice of the π± mesons. After [4].

In a cubic lattice of N = 2.85·109 neutrinos and antineutrinos the spin of
nearly all neutrinos must cancel because conservation of angular momentum
during the creation of the particle requires that the total angular momentum
around a central axis is only a small integer or half-integer number. In fact
the spin vectors of all but the neutrino in the center of the lattice cancel. In
order for this to be so the direction of the spin of any particular neutrino in
the lattice has to be opposite to the direction of the spin of the antineutrino

7

at its mirror position. Neutrinos and antineutrinos of the same type diﬀer
in the lattice only by the direction of their spin. As can be seen on Fig. 1
each neutrino has at its mirror position an antineutrino. The only angular
momentum remaining from the spin of the neutrinos of the lattice is the
angular momentum of the neutrino at the center of the lattice. Consequently
the electrically neutral neutrino lattice consisting of N neutrinos, each with
a spin ni, has an intrinsic angular momentum j = Pi j(ni) = ¯h/2.

The standing longitudinal oscillations of the neutrinos in the lattice of the
π± mesons do not cause an angular momentum, Pi j(νi) = 0. But electrons
or positrons added to the neutral neutrino lattice have spin 1/2. If the spin
of the electron or positron added to the neutrino lattice is opposite to the
spin of the neutrino in the center of the lattice then the net spin of the π+
or π− mesons is zero, or

j(π±) = X
i

j(ni) + j(e±) = 0

(1 ≤ i ≤ N) .

(11)

It is important for the understanding of the structure of the π± mesons to
realize that s(π±) = 0 can only be explained if the π± mesons consist of
a neutrino lattice to which an electron or positron is added whose spin is
opposite to the net spin of the neutrino lattice. Spin 1/2 of the electric
charges can only be canceled by something that has also spin 1/2, and the
only conventional choice for that is the neutrino.

The spin of the K± mesons is zero. With the spin of the K± mesons we
encounter the same oddity we have just observed with the spin of the π±
mesons, namely we have a particle which carries an electrical charge with
spin 1/2, and nevertheless the particle does not have spin. The explanation
of s(K±) = 0 follows the same lines as the explanation of the spin of the π±
mesons. In the standing wave model the K± mesons are described by the
n + π0, that means by the (2.2) mode of the charged neutrino
state (2.2)π±
lattice oscillations plus a π0 meson. The (2.2)π±
n state of the neutrino lattice
is the sum of the energy of the (2.2) oscillation of the lattice plus the sum of
the energies of the rest masses of the neutrinos and contains 340 Mev. The
(2.2) mode of the longitudinal oscillations of a neutral neutrino lattice does
not have a net intrinsic angular momentum. But the spin of the neutrinos
contributes an angular momentum ¯h/2, which originates from the neutrino
in the center of the lattice, just as it is with the neutrino lattice in the π±
mesons, so Pi j(ni) = ¯h/2. Adding an electric charge with a spin opposite
to the net intrinsic angular momentum of the neutrino lattice creates the

8

charged (2.2)π±

n mode which has zero spin,

j((2.2)π±

j(ni) + j(e±) = 0 .

n ) = X
i
As discussed in [4] it is necessary to add a π0 meson to the (2.2)π±
n mode
of the π± meson in order to obtain the correct mass and the correct decays
of the K± mesons. Since the π0 does not have spin the addition of the π0
meson does not add to the intrinsic angular momentum of the K ± mesons.
So, according to Eq.(12), s(K±) = 0 in agreement with the facts.

(12)

The explanation of s = 0 of the K0 mesons described by the state (2.2)π±
n
+ π∓ follows similar lines. The longitudinal oscillations of the (2.2)π±
n mode
as well as of the basic π∓ mode do not create an angular momentum, Pi j(νi)
= 0. The ﬁrst higher mode of the π± mesons, the (2.2)π±
n state, and the basic
π∓ mode each have N neutrinos, so the number of neutrinos in the sum of
both states, the K0 meson, is 2N. Since the size of the lattice of the K± mesons
and the K0 mesons is the same it follows that two neutrinos are at each lattice
point of the K0 meson. We assume that Pauli’s exclusion principle applies
for neutrinos as well. Consequently each neutrino at each lattice point must
share its location with an antineutrino. That means that the contribution of
the spin of all neutrinos to the intrinsic angular momentum of the K0 meson
is zero or Pi j(2ni) = 0. The sum of the spin vectors of the two opposite
charges in the K0 meson, i.e.
in (2.2)π± + π∓, is also zero. Since neither
the neutrino oscillations nor the spin of the neutrinos nor the electric charges
contribute an angular momentum or since

j(K 0) = X

( j(νi) + j(2ni)) + j(e+ + e−) = 0 ,

(13)

i

the intrinsic angular momentum of the K0 meson is zero, or s(K0) = 0, as
it must be. In simple terms, since the structure of K0 is (2.2)π±
n + π∓, the
spin of K0 is the sum of the spin of (2.2)π±
n and π∓ in K0, both of which do
not have spin. It does not seem possible to arrive at s = 0 for the K0 meson
if the particle does not contain the 2N neutrinos required by the (2.2)π±
n +
π∓ state which we have suggested in section 6 of [4].

In the standing wave model the neutron, which has spin 1/2 and a mass
≈ 2m(K±) or 2m(K0), is either the superposition of a K+ and a K− meson or
of two K0 mesons. In the case of the neutron one must wonder how it comes
about that a particle which seems to be the superposition of two particles
without spin ends up with spin 1/2. The intrinsic angular momentum of the

9

sum of K+ and K− comes in part from the superposition of two perpendic-
ular standing longitudinal neutrino lattice oscillations. Similar to the case
of the Λ baryon the sum of the angular momentum vectors of the circular
oscillations of all neutrinos in the lattice reduces to the angular momentum
of the circular wave at the center of the lattice. Following Eq.(8) the angular
momentum of the circular wave at the center or the net angular momentum
of the entire neutrino lattice oscillations is Pi j(νi) = ¯h/2. The intrinsic an-
gular momentum of the neutron consists consequently in part of the angular
momentum of the circular neutrino lattice oscillations whose net sum is ¯h/2.
The superposition of two K± mesons also means that the lattice contains
2N neutrinos because K+ as well as K− each contains N neutrinos. Assuming
that Pauli’s exclusion principle applies, each neutrino in the lattice must
share its place with a neutrino of opposite spin. That means that the spin
vectors of all neutrinos of the lattice cancel, Pi j(2ni) = 0. Neither the
neutrinos nor the spin of the charges of the sum of the K+ and K− mesons
contribute to the net intrinsic angular momentum. But, and that is crucial,
the superposition of the oscillations in the two π0 mesons which are part
n + π0 structure of K± adds an angular momentum Pi j(2π0)
of the (2.2)π±
= ¯h/2 to the net angular momentum of the sum of K+ + K−, because the
electromagnetic waves in the π0 mesons are superposed at right angles and
shifted in phase by π/2 just as the neutrino lattice oscillations. Consequently
the sum of the intrinsic angular momentum vectors of the superposition of a
K+ and a K− meson is

j(K + + K −) = X

(j(νi) + j(2ni)) + j(e+ + e−) + j(2π0) = 0 or ¯h ,

(14)

i

which is incompatible with the experimental facts. We conclude that the
neutron cannot be the superposition of a K+ and a K− meson.

On the other hand the neutron can well be the superposition of two K0
mesons or of a K0 and a ¯K0 meson. A signiﬁcant change in the lattice occurs
when two K0 mesons are superposed. Since each K0 meson contains 2N neu-
trinos, as we discussed before in context with the spin of K0, the number of
neutrinos in two superposed K0 lattices is 4N. Since the size of the lattice of
the proton as well of the neutron is the same as the size of K0, (the measured
rp is within the experimental error the same as rπ), each lattice point now
contains four neutrinos, a muon neutrino and an anti-muon neutrino as well
as an electron neutrino and an anti-electron neutrino. The quartet of neutri-
nos oscillates just like individual neutrinos do because we have found in [4]

10

that the ratios of the sum of the oscillation frequencies are independent of the
mass as well as of the interaction constant between the lattice points. In the
neutrino quartets the spin of the neutrinos cancels, Pi j(4ni) = 0. The su-
perposition of the neutrino oscillations, that means of circular oscillations of
frequency νi, contribute the angular momentum of the center circular wave,
so Pi j(νi) = ¯h/2. The spin and charge of the four electrical charges hidden
in the two K0 mesons cancel. There is no π0 component in K0 and conse-
quently no contribution to the intrinsic angular momentum. It follows that
the intrinsic angular momentum of a neutron created by the superposition
of two K0 mesons comes from the circular neutrino lattice oscillations only
and is

( j(νi) + j(4ni)) + j(4e±) = ¯h/2 ,

(15)

j(n) = X
i

as it must be. In simple terms, the spin of the neutron originates from the
superposition of two perpendicular standing neutrino lattice oscillation with
the same frequencies shifted in phase by π/2, which produces the angular
momentum ¯h/2.

The spin of the proton is 1/2 and is unambiguosly deﬁned by the decay
of the neutron n → p + e− + ¯νe. The remaining particles of the neutrino
branch, the D±,0 and D±
S mesons both having zero spin, are superpositions
of a proton and a neutron of opposite spin, or of their antiparticles, or of
two neutrons of opposite spin in D0. The spin of D± and D0 does therefore
not pose a new problem. We note in passing that in D0 a π0 meson replaces
a π± meson in D±, and consequently the mass diﬀerence m(D±) − m(D0) =
4.78 MeV is very similar to m(π±) − m(π0) = 4.593 MeV, comparable to the
case m(K0) − m(K±) in [4]. Replacing a π± meson by a π0 meson does not
S only a π0 meson is added to D± and therefore its
change the spin. In D±
spin is the same as that of D±.

The Σ+, the Σ− and the Ξ− baryons are aﬄicted by the same problem we
have encountered with the π± and K± mesons, namely their spin does not
seem to add up. When electric charge, either an electron or positron with
spin 1/2, is added to the Σ0 or Ξ0 baryons, both of which have spin 1/2, the
resulting Σ± and Ξ− baryons should not have the same spin s = 1/2 as the
Σ0 and Ξ0 have. This puzzle can be solved when the charge added to the Σ0
or Ξ0 is not added as an electron or positron but rather as π+ or π− mesons
which do not have spin. Considering the structure of the Σ0 baryon we have
found in [4], which is 2·(2.2)π0 + π0, we can replace the single π0 meson in
Σ0 with a π+ or π− meson without changing the mass of Σ0 signiﬁcantly

11

and without changing the spin. The same applies correspondingly to Ξ0.
The presence of either π+ or π− in Σ± becomes quite clear from the decay
of these particles. Σ+ decays into p + π0 (51.57%) and n + π+ (48.31%),
both make up 99.88% of the Σ+ decays. Σ− decays into Λ + π− (99.848%),
whereas Σ0 decays into Λ + γ (100%). Ξ− decays into Λ + π− (99.887%)
whereas Ξ0 decays into Λ + π0 (99.54%). In particular in the latter case it
seems to be obvious that in the Ξ− baryon a π− meson replaces a π0 meson
in Ξ0. If this is the case, then there is no problem with the spin of Ξ− being
the same as the spin of Ξ0. The same applies to the spin of the Σ± baryons.

Conclusions

The intrinsic angular momentum of the so-called stable elementary particles
can be explained with the sum of the angular momentum vectors of the
electromagnetic waves or photon lattice oscillations, plus the sum of the spin
vectors of the electromagnetic waves, plus the sum of the spin vectors of the
electric charges if any are in the particles of the γ-branch. Correspondingly,
the intrinsic angular momentum of the particles of the neutrino branch is the
sum of the angular momentum vectors of the neutrino lattice oscillations, plus
the sum of the spin vectors of the neutrinos, plus the sum of the spin vectors
of the electric charges which the particles carry.

The most simple particles, the π0 and η mesons, do not have spin because
neither the longitudinal oscillations of the photon lattice nor the linearly po-
larized electromagnetic waves can contribute to an intrinsic angular momen-
tum. The π± and K± mesons are quite diﬀerent because the electric charges
in either particle bring with them spin 1/2. Since s(π±) and s(K±) = 0 the
spin of e± in π± and K± must be canceled by something that has likewise
spin 1/2. We have shown that the sum of the spin vectors of the very many
neutrinos which in our model are in π± and K± reduces to the spin of the
neutrino at the center of the lattice. If the spin of the electric charge and of
the neutrino at the center of the lattice are of opposite direction then s(π±)
and s(K±) = 0, as it must be. The spin of K0 is likewise zero. There can be
no contribution to the spin of K0 from the two opposite charges which are in
K0 according to our model. There is also no contribution from the spin of the
neutrinos because at each lattice point the spin of each neutrino is canceled
by the spin of its antineutrino. Neither the longitudinal lattice oscillations,

12

nor the spin vectors of the neutrinos, nor the two electrical charges contribute
to an angular momentum of K0, so s(K0) = 0.

The spin s = 1/2 of the Λ baryon and the neutron, which have a mass
m(Λ) ≈ 2m(η) and m(n) ≈ 2m(K0), can be explained with the sum of the
angular momentum vectors of the superpositions of two perpendicular stand-
ing waves of the same frequencies shifted in phase by π/2, as they are in Λ
and n in the standing wave model. In either case an angular momentum ¯h/2
remains at the center of the lattice from the multitude of standing circular
waves in these particles. There can be no other contributions to the intrin-
sic angular momentum of these particles and hence s(Λ) and s(n) = 1/2.
The other baryons are composites of Λ and their spin does not pose a new
problem.

Our explanation of the intrinsic angular momentum conﬁrms the validity
of the structure of the particles which we considered. A convincing example
of this correlation is oﬀered by the explanation of the puzzling absence of
spin in the π± mesons in spite of the electric charge these particles carry.
The standing wave model assumes that the π± mesons have a cubic neutrino
lattice. The net spin of the neutrinos in the lattice cancels the spin of the
electric charges in π±. The spin, the mass and the decays of the π± mesons
require a neutrino lattice for the π± mesons. Spin 1/2 of the Λ baryon,
and consequently of the other baryons of the γ-branch, and spin 1/2 of the
neutron originates from the superposition of two perpendicular standing os-
cillations in the particles, as the standing wave model postulates; and as is
indicated by the mass ratios m(Λ)/m(η) ≈ 2 and m(n)/m(K0) ≈ 2. The spin
of the stable mesons and baryons can be explained with the standing wave
model without an additional assumption.

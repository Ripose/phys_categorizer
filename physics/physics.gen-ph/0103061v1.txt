Abstract

The goal of this paper is to sketch a broader outline of the mathematical struc-
tures present in the Nonlinear Maxwell Theory in continuation of work previously
presented in [11], [12] and [13]. In particular, I display new types of both dynamic
and static solutions of the Nonlinear Maxwell Equations (NM). I point out how
the resulting theory ties to the Quantum Mechanics of Correlated Electrons inas-
much as it provides a mesoscopic description of phenomena like nonresistive charge
transport, static magnetic ﬂux tubes, and charge stripes in a way consistent with
both the phenomenology and the microscopic principles. In addition, I point at a
bunch of geometric structures intrinsic for the theory. On one hand, the presence
of these structures indicates that the equations at hand can be used as ‘probing
tools’ for purely geometric exploration of low-dimensional manifolds. On the other
hand, global aspects of these structures are in my view prerequisite to incorporat-
ing (quantum) informational features of Correlated Electron Systems within the
framework of the Nonlinear Maxwell Theory.

1 Introduction

The general goal of this paper is to examine broader ramiﬁcations of the Nonlinear
Maxwell Equations (NM) as introduced by me in 1992/93 and further developed in [11],
[12], [13]. To this end, I ﬁrst point out that the theory is considerably richer than that
of the classical linear Electromagnetism.
In particular, I describe here several distinct
types of both static and dynamic solutions on a spacetime of the form M 3 × R. On
the technical side, I have essentially avoided heavier analysis as the solutions are either
obtained by means of elementary calculation, or are otherwise based on deeper analytic
work described in [13]. One should be aware that the possibilities opening in consequence

of the introduction of these new structures have not been fully exploited in this paper,
thus postponing many potential developments into the future.

More precisely, in the ‘dynamic’ part of the paper I display a solution in the form of
a charge-carrying electromagnetic wave. It is a soliton type wave that transports charge
with constant speed and without resistance. In addition, one notes existence of a speciﬁc
to dimension four nonlinear Fourier type transform—an interesting structure whose role
within the theory is twofold. On one hand, it can be used to ﬁnd and analyze new solutions
of the Nonlinear Maxwell Equations. On the other hand, the transform deﬁnes an exotic
duality—a (quadratic) generalization of the (linear) Hodge duality. Consequences of this
new duality for the four-geometry will be exploited in the future.

The second set of results in this paper is focused around the question of existence and
properties of static solutions. To this end, I ﬁrst examine the situation on the Euclidean
three-space. In particular, one takes note of the occurrence of global structures in the
form of magnetic ﬂux tubes as well as the so-called charge stripes. It is interesting from
the point of view of geometry that these objects exist in general only on three-manifolds
whose fundamental group is not ﬁnite. This is tied to the geometric fact that the nonlinear
gauge theory at hand induces an additional structure on M 3—namely a taut codimension
one foliation. These global aspects of static solutions prompt an assumption of topological
point of view. Accordingly, I sketch the possibility of constructing ‘nonlinear cohomology’
that would account for a sort of ‘ﬂux tube’ invariant of a three manifold. The discussion
here is based on two particular examples that I feel provide an optimal illustration of the
underlying concept.

The Nonlinear Maxwell Equations, cf. (1-3) below, involve a vector potential that
encodes the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the usual way as well as an additional scalar
f . The function f contains information, extractable in a certain simple canonical way,
about the local value of the ﬁlling factor (also known as the ﬁlling fraction). (The ﬁlling
factor is deﬁned as the number of quanta of the magnetic ﬁeld per electron charge in the
ﬁrst Landau level. It is then natural and eﬀective to think of the electrons as forming
in conjunction with the corresponding magnetic ﬂux quanta composite particles—either
bosons or fermions, or Laughlin particles depending on the actual value of the ﬁlling
factor.) It is thus postulated that the ﬁlling fraction—typically an input of a microscopic
theory that is always assumed constant microlocally—is allowed to slowly vary in the
coarser scale. In fact, it was shown in [13] that NM predict occurrence of phase changes
that lead to formation of vortices in f , and a fortiori in the magnetic ﬁeld. This picture
conforms with the well known analogy between the Quantum Hall Eﬀects and the High-
Tc Superconductivity. An inquisitive reader might now point at the following seeming
conundrum. The physical interpretation of f as a ﬁlling factor requires the presence of
two-dimensional geometric structures that endow us with a possibility of including the
lowest Landau level in the basic dictionary. Thus, it may appear a priori puzzling, how we
are going to retain this interpretation of f in three or four spatial dimensions? The answer
is provided by the intrinsic structure of the NM themselves. On one hand, it is shown
below that the ﬁlling factor variable may be completely factored out of the equations when
viewed in the complete four dimensions of spacetime. Needless to say, if one attempted
to analyze such f -free form in two dimensions the f variable would reemerge without

2

change as it is there encoded in the magnetic ﬁeld B = b/f , b = const. On the other
hand, one notes that a remnant or a generalization of the ﬁlling factor interpretation
carries over to three dimensions. Namely, the NM in three dimensions imply existence
of a codimension one foliation of the three-space associated with the static solutions.
Moreover, one notes here that the NM do not a priori introduce any restrictions as to
the type of the resulting foliation—in fact any regular foliation and even foliations with
singularities introduced by degenerating leaves are admitted by the equations. However,
as already mentioned above the existence of solutions of a special type, namely the ﬂux-
tube type, implies geometrical restrictions on the foliation and topological restrictions on
the three-manifold. Indeed, in this case foliation must be taut. It also seems reasonable
to expect that the composite particle interpretation remains valid in this setting and the
number of participating electrons in each leaf is again determined by f , virtually leading
to the notion of an eﬀective Landau level.

In the last words of this section I would like to admit that, the subject matter at hand
being both new and inherently interdisciplinary as well as by way of my own background
and limitations, it is not always easy to pick the optimal terminology. Realizing I will
unavoidably fail to satisfy in this respect one group of readers or another, I can only ask
the readership to be as tolerant as they can aﬀord and hope that in the end substance
will triumph over form.

2 Nonlinear Maxwell Equations in Spacetime

In what follows, in order to get around rather tedious algebra while not compromising
our understanding of what is essentially involved, I present a shortcut style exposition of
the necessary calculations. I believe that readers who are well familiar with diﬀerential
geometry will ﬁnd it easy to reinterpret this calculation in its natural invariant setting,
while those who are less familiar with the abstract setting may in fact appreciate its
absence here.

Consider the following system of equations—the Nonlinear Maxwell Equations (NM)

in the form in which they have appeared in my previous papers.

dFA = 0

δ(f FA) = 0
✷f + a|FA|2f = νf.

where f is a real valued function and A is the electromagnetic vector potential, so that
the corresponding electromagnetic ﬁeld is FA = dA. Here, a > 0 is a physical constant
; I will not discuss the precise physical interpretation of a2 in this
with unit
paper. Further, d is the exterior derivative and δ = ⋆d⋆ its adjoint. Here, it is assumed
i
that the Hodge star ⋆ and the D’Alembertian ✷ are induced by the Lorentzian metric
tensor on a spacetime of 3 + 1 dimensions. Let me point out that assuming f = const
and dragging it to zero one recovers the classical Maxwell equations. In this sense, all
phenomena of the classical electromagnetism are included in the present model.

3

Now the goal is to better understand the essential ingredients of the NM in terms of the
classical ﬁeld variables. To this end, let us say the spacetime is in fact the ﬂat Minkowski
space (with the speed of light 1) so that in particular one can identify coeﬃcients of the
electric ﬁeld ~E and the magnetic ﬁeld ~B with the coeﬃcients of the curvature tensor FA
by the formula

FA = B1dy ∧ dz + B2dz ∧ dx + B3dx ∧ dy + E1dx ∧ dt + E2dy ∧ dt + E3dz ∧ dt.

(4)

For the sake of our discussion below it is good to keep in mind the well known fact that
the components of FA are not Lorentz invariant. This property leads one to the derivation
of the Lorentz force, so that the latter one is logically independent of the particular form
of a gauge theory formulated in terms of FA. In other words, the Lorentz force remains
unchanged and valid as one attempts to modify the ﬁeld equations. With this understood,
let us continue the discussion of equations (1-3).

It would be rather straightforward to rewrite equations (1-3) in the anticipated Maxwellian

form by following the usual procedures for translating (2) into the ´Ampere and Gauss laws
after having replaced ~E by f ~E and ~B by f ~B. In fact, this would lead to an ad hoc inter-
pretation of f as a material constant—a route taken in our older, one might say naive,
paper [11]. However, this form of the system oﬀers little insight as to the more essential
implications of the NM, and one needs to ﬁnd a less obvious reformulation.
One notes that equation (2) may be equivalently written in the form

f δFA = FA(∇3+1f, .)

(5)

where ∇3+1 stands for the gradient in spacetime. For a reason that will become clear
later, one identiﬁes FA with a skew-symmetric matrix in a standard way

This enables us to rewrite equation (5) in the form

FA(∇3+1f, .) = F ∇3+1f.

F −1δFA = ∇3+1 ln(f ).

(6)

It is perhaps worthwhile to realize that in this context F is a ﬁberwise-linear mapping from
the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle. Here one assumes f > 0 a.e. This conforms
with the principle that one will be consistently looking for strong solutions so that in
particular f may always be replaced with |f | in (1-3). Next one recalls that on one hand
the ﬁrst part of the NM (1) is identical with the analogous part of the classical Maxwell
equations and it encodes the Faraday’s law of magnetic induction and the fact that there
are no spatially extensive magnetic charges. This gives the ﬁrst four (scalar) equations
below, namely (7) and (8). On the other hand, by direct multiplication and regrouping in
(6), one obtains four further scalar equations that happen to radically modify the ´Ampere
law. Written in the familiar three-space vector notation, the NM assume the form

provided ~E · ~B 6= 0. In fact, also the case when ~E · ~B = 0 is worth our attention and
will be discussed below. As much as one should avoid indulging in formal manipulations
of formulas, here the advantage of having the equations rewritten in several equivalent
forms is that they all lead to the discovery of new types of solutions, the existence of
which would be otherwise obscured by notation. This will become more evident in the
following sections.

As already mentioned in the introduction, I postulate the following physical interpre-
tation: f is the spatially varying ﬁlling factor—a notion central to the modern composite-
particle theories.
In fact, the canonical microscopic-theory interpretation of the ﬁlling
factor is valid in two spatial dimensions only, in which case it signiﬁes the ratio of the
number of quanta of the ambient magnetic ﬁeld to the number of electrons in the ﬁrst
Landau level, cf.
[7], [17]. Moreover, the microscopic theory oﬀers no hints as to the
existence and relevance of an analogous notion in the three-space. A description of the

5

interaction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld with fermions in the ﬁrst Landau level provided
by the equations above is valid in the mesoscopic scale. Here, as one ‘zooms out’ from the
microscopic scale, the ﬁlling factor is neither a rational number nor is it a constant any-
more. In fact, as it has been communicated in previous papers the spatially varying ﬁlling
factor may assume the form of a vortex lattice, cf. [13]. For the time being, this point of
view is validated by the well known analogy between the Quantum Hall Eﬀect and the
High Temperature Superconductivity and it awaits experimental conﬁrmation. Moreover,
the NM extend the notion of the ﬁlling factor to three spatial dimensions. However, as
we will see below, the presence of the ﬁlling factor introduces an especially interesting
modiﬁcation of the laws of Electromagnetism only if the three-space comes equipped with
a codimension one foliation. This latter fact makes it possible to talk about Landau levels
in a certain sense, anyhow. Finally, f can be completely eliminated from the NM in 3 + 1
dimensions. (In general, this requires that the ﬁrst cohomology group of the spacetime
vanishes.) In that case the NM can be written in the f -free form

dFA = 0

where # is the isomorphism of the tangent and the cotangent bundles given by the metric.
Indeed, under the assumption of vanishing ﬁrst de-Rham cohomology, equation (6) is
equivalent to its integrability condition (12). Moreover, since the last scalar equation of
the system can be written in terms of d ln f in the form

(cid:12)

δd ln f − |d ln f |2 + a|FA|2 − ν = 0,

equation (6) also implies (13). Computation of the symbol shows that the system obtained
in this way is non-hyperbolic—in fact its degeneracy is of higher order. Thus, this form
of the NM appears impractical for any mathematical work, and an introduction of the
dimensionless scalar f is necessary also from the point of view of analysis. Nevertheless,
as indicated in the Introduction and the discussion above, physical implications of the
existence of an f -free form of the NM are important.

3 Geometry Behind the Equations

The geometrical arena of the Maxwell equations consists of a spacetime, say N, and a
principal U(1)-bundle, say P , stack up above N. In addition, it seems any description
of the interaction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld with fermions requires, at least within this
framework, a principal connection, i.e. a smooth (at least a.e.) distribution of horizontal
planes that is invariant with respect to the circle action. This distribution can be written
as ker A = ker f A for f 6= 0. In addition, if U(1) is to remain the elemental symmetry
group of Electromagnetism, then f must be constant along the ﬁbers so that it eﬀectively

6

descends to a function on N. In particular, within this dictionary one can construct a
Kaluza-Klein metric on P , which is given by

µA(X, Y ) = g(π∗X, π∗Y ) + aA(X)A(Y ),

if the unit of length on P is to be
where the unit of a > 0 must be
[meter] and the unit of FA = dA is to remain, say, [Tesla]. Let us say the corresponding
Laplace-Beltrami operator on forms is then △µA = △A. Calculation shows that the
condition

is equivalent to the system of equations (1–3), cf. [11].

△A(f A) = νf A

4 Exotic Duality

For the sake of discussion in this section, consider the NM on either a Lorentzian or a
Riemannian four-manifold as the metric signature plays a secondary role. In particular,
it is preferable to replace the ✷-notation with the △-notation. Assume for the sake of
simplicity that the second cohomology group of the manifold is trivial. Omitting the
constant a, write the system one more time in the form

Since (14) implies d(f ⋆ dA) = 0, one has f ⋆ dA = d ˜A so that

and the new form ˜A satisﬁes a dual system of equations

δ(f dA) = 0

− △f + |dA|2f = νf.

dA = ±1/f ⋆ d ˜A

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

This is a functional transform reminiscent of the Fourier or the Backlund transforms,
notwithstanding the fact that all transforms are somewhat reminiscent of one another.
In particular, the resulting dualistic perspective has the expected property that trivial
solutions of one of the systems lead to more complex solutions of the dual system. To
illustrate the idea, let me now present a few examples of dual solutions on R4 with either
the Euclidean or the Minkowski metric as speciﬁed in the discussion.

Example 1. Let the metric be Euclidean and take dA = Edz ∧ dt, E = const, and
f = f (x, y). Equation (14) is automatically satisﬁed and (15) assumes the form −fxx −
2 = ν − E2 solves the problem.
fyy = (ν − E2)f so that f = cos (k1x + k2y + α) for k2
Now d ˜A = ±f (x, y)dx ∧ dy and it staisﬁes equations (17-18).

1 + k2

Example 2. Departing for a while from the assumption of vanishing second cohomology,
let us reinterpret the previous example on a four-torus assuming periodicity of coordinates
(x, y, z, t) with period 2π. Note that the ﬁrst bundle is necessarily nontrivial as the
cohomology class [dA] 6= 0. Let us allow the function f drop its dependence on y so that,
say, f = cos x, provided the ‘right choice’ of ν has been made. Now, d ˜A = d(sin xdy) is
an exact form so the second bundle is topologically trivial.

Example 3. Consider dA = Bdx ∧ dy and f = f (z, t) so that (14) is satisﬁed. Let us
now look at the metric with signature (+ + +−) so that (15) means ftt − fzz = (ν − B2)f .
The general solution of this equation is a standing wave with variable amplitude. This
pattern is inherited by d ˜A = f (z, t)dz ∧ dt (up to the sign again) which satisﬁes (17-18).
Example 4. Let us for a change begin on the other side and take, say, d ˜A = edz∧dt and
f = f (x, y). Again, the ﬁrst equation (14) is automatically satisﬁed while (15) becomes
−fxx − fyy + e2/f = νf . As explained in [13] (see also remarks at the end of section 6
below) apart from the trivial constant solution, this problem also has a solution in the
In the latter case dA = f (x, y)dx ∧ dy satisﬁes (14-15) and

represents static magnetic ﬂux tubes.

I emphasize that only the vector potential A and the ﬁlling fraction variable f that
appear in the ﬁrst set of equations have physical interpretation. Reassuringly, the presence
of a nontrivial f in examples 1 and 3 did not contribute anything unexpectedly strange
to the constant electric and magnetic ﬁelds in these examples, while it ‘introduced’ ﬂux
tubes in example 4. Although one could consider similar interpretation of the transformed
vector potential ˜A, just as one can for any U(1)-connection, I feel this is uncalled for and
would probably be unjustiﬁable at this point. Nevertheless, the existence of the transform
is a remarkable fact whose possible applications to four-manifolds will be explored more
thoroughly in the future.
In a way, this new duality is a generalization of the regular
Hodge-star duality that may be compared to the projective generalization of the Euclidean
reﬂection. This analogy may be justiﬁed in the following way. Projective duality is induced
by a ﬁxed quadratic form. What is the NM analog of that object? Introduce notation
ϕ = ln f . A direct calculation shows that (14-15) may be written in the form of a system
of quadratic equations

δdA + ⋆(dϕ ∧ ⋆dA) = 0

− △ϕ − |dϕ|2 + |dA|2 − ν = 0.

(19)

(20)

This form of the equation has one other advantage. Suppose one has found a solution
(A, ϕ) of (19-20). One can now use gauge invariance of the equations in the following way.
Let χ be a solution of the equation

The existence of a solution χ follows from the Fredholm alternative when the metric is
positive deﬁnite, and it amounts to solving a linear wave equation in a Lorentzian metric.
One can now replace A with A + dχ (and denote the resulting form by A again). In the
new gauge δA = 0, so that A in fact satisﬁes

△ A + ⋆(dϕ ∧ ⋆dA) = 0.

(21)

δdχ = −δA.

8

The system that consists of (21) and (20) is either quasilinear elliptic or hyperbolic,
depending on the metric. Solving the latter system may not be helpful at all in ﬁnding
solutions of the original (19-20), since one cannot guarantee that a solution satisﬁes the
Lorentz gauge condition δA = 0. However, solutions of (19-20) a fortiori satisfy (21) and
(20) so that in particular they will obey all a priori estimates on the solutions of, say,
quasilinear hyperbolic systems.
In particular, this point of view may justify the claim
that the phenomena described in this paper shed some light on the complex nature of
quasilinear systems of PDE of certain types in general.

5 Charge Transport and Charge Stripes

I will now take full advantage of the (7-11) form of the NM. In analogy to the electromag-
netic wave in vacuum, that one recalls is counted among the solutions of this system, one
wants to look for a solution with ~E · ~B = 0. In the end I will check that the new solution
of (7-11) in fact satisﬁes (1-3) which is not a priori guarantied. Make an Ansatz

~B = B1

where e, B1 and B2 are a priori functions of (x, y, z, t) that are smooth a.e. and neither
one of them vanishes identically. As an immediate consequence, one obtains that (7) and
(8) are equivalent to

B1,t = (eB1),z

B2,t = (eB2),z

(eB1),x + (eB2),y = 0

B1,x + B2,y = 0

e,xB1 + e,yB2 = 0.

which implies

On the other hand, (9) and (10) are equivalent to

(B2,x − B1,y)eB1 = (eB2),xB1 − (eB1),yB1

(B2,x − B1,y)eB2 = (eB2),xB2 − (eB1),yB2

(−(eB2),t + B2,z) B1 + ((eB1),t − B1,z) B2 = 0.

Equations (23), (24) and (30) imply that e is in fact constant

Using (23) and (24) again, one obtains

B1 = B1(x, y, t + ez),

B2 = B2(x, y, t + ez).

e = ±1.

(31)

In particular, ~B and ~E are not compactly supported. At this point, the only condition
left a priori unfulﬁlled is the vanishing divergence condition. Thus, all equations (23-30)
above are satisﬁed iﬀ there is a function ψ = ψ(x, y, t + ez) such that

B1 = −ψy(x, y, t + ez),

B2 = ψx(x, y, t + ez).

(32)

Deﬁning the electric and magnetic ﬁelds by (22) with e = ±1 , so that in particular
| ~E| = | ~B|, and choosing f that satisﬁes the linear wave equation (11), one obtains a
solution of (7-11) .

However, physical solutions must in addition satisfy the a priori more restrictive sys-
tem (1-3). Consider FA as given in (4). Equation (1) is satisﬁed automatically since it is
equivalent to (7-8). On the other hand, (2) becomes

(f B2),x − (f B1),y = 0

(f eB2),t − (f B2),z = 0

− (f eB1),t + (f B1),z = 0

− (f B1),y + (f B2),x = 0

f = f (x, y, t + ez).

− f,xx − f,yy = νf

(f ψ,x),x + (f ψ,y),y = 0.

Now, (34) and (35) imply via (32) that

In particular, f,tt − f,zz = 0. Thus, (1-3) has been reduced to the following system of two
equations:

The ﬁrst equation above admits three types of classical solutions. Namely,

A(t + ez) ln (x2 + y2)
A(t + ez) cos (k1x + k2y + α(t + ez))
A(t + ez) exp (k1x + k2y)

Observe that each solution eﬀectively depends on one harmonic variable in the (x, y)-
domain—either, u = k1x + k2y or u = ln r2 = ln (x2 + y2). Thus, equation (38) is satisﬁed
if

ψu = C(t + ez)/f (u, t + ez),

for an arbitrary function C of one variable. Therefore, in view of (32) one obtains three
types of solutions (redeﬁning C)

C(t + ez)/(r2 ln r2)[−y, x]
C(t + ez) sec (k1x + k2y + α)[−k2, k1]
C(t + ez) exp (−k1x − k2y)[−k2, k1]

in correspondence with (39). Since one is looking for strong solutions, one has the freedom
to cut oﬀ pieces of the classical solutions (by restricting the domain) and to put them

In this way, one obtains solutions that are either continuous or have
jump discontinuities but may be guarantied to remain bounded. Last but not least,
it is physically correct to interpret the divergence of the electric ﬁeld as charge ρ and
~E + ∇ × ~B as the electric current. One checks that for solutions as above the (x, y)-

in correspondence with (39) and (40). In addition to the piecewise smooth distribution of
charge, one should include charge concentrated on singular surfaces where the electric ﬁeld
has jump discontinuities as indicated by the distributional derivative ∇ · ~E. Therefore,
charge is transported along the z-axis with the speed e = ±1 and without resistance as
the vector of current is perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld. Charge is mostly concentrated
along charge stripes where the electric and magnetic ﬁelds have singularities. The net
current depends on the particular choice of a (strong) solution. Of course, the theory
does not tell us how to solve the practical problem of electronics—namely, how to create
conditions for a particular function C = C(t + ez), constant ν and a desired mosaic of
singularities to actually occur in a physical system.

6 Static Solutions and Magnetic Flux Tubes

The classical Maxwell equations admit static solutions of two types only: the uniform ﬁeld
solutions, and the unit charge or monolpole-type solutions, as well as superpositions of
these fundamental types of solutions. As we will see below, the nonlinear theory encom-
passes a larger realm including the magnetic-ﬂux-tube type and the charge-stripe type
solutions. These additional conﬁgurations require nonlinearity and cannot be superposed,
which gives them more rigidity. In the next section we will see what can be said about the
variety of such solutions, while in this section I will only display a single example of this
type. Apart from the applicable goal, the idea is to present an example that possesses all
the essential features of the general class of solutions yet the required calculation is free
of more subtle geometric technicalities.

Time-independent solutions of the NM posses physical interpretation only if they
satisfy the equations in the classical sense almost everywhere. Assuming that all ﬁelds
are independent of time (7-11) takes on the form

∇ × ~E = 0

∇ · ~B = 0
− (∇ × ~B) × ~E + (∇ · ~E) ~B = −( ~E · ~B)∇ ln f
(∇ × ~B) · ~B = 0

planes perpendicular to the ﬁeld ~B are ﬂat, say,

~B = b(x, y)

∂

.

One easily checks that equations (43) and (45) are satisﬁed. Assume in addition that the
electric ﬁeld is potential, i.e.

~E = ∇ψ(x, y, z), where ψz 6= 0 a.e.

so that (42) is satisﬁed. Remembering notation ϕ = ln f , one calculates directly that

(∇ × ~B) × ~E = −ψzbx

and

( ~E · ~B)∇ϕ.

ψz(bϕx + bx) = 0

ψz(bϕy + by) = 0

Thus, equation (44) is equivalent to the following system of three equations

and since ψz 6= 0 one obtains from the ﬁrst two equations

b △ ψ − ψxbx − ψyby − bψzϕz = 0

ϕ(x, y, z) = ϕ1(x, y) + ϕ2(z) and b = β exp (−ϕ1),

while the third equation assumes the form

△ ψ + ∇ψ · ∇ϕ = 0

(47)

At this point the NM have been reduced to the system of just two scalar equations (46)
and (47). Denote f1 = exp ϕ1 and f2 = exp ϕ2 and assume in addition

so that

ψ = ψ(z)

ψ′(z) = ǫ exp (−ϕ2) =

ǫ
f2

It now follows from (46) and (47) that the triplet

is a solution of the NM if only f1 and f2 satisfy a decoupled system of semi-linear elliptic
equations

At this point, I would like to emphasize one more time that in a ﬁeld theory one
looks for strong solutions, i.e. solutions that satisfy equations in the classical sense almost
everywhere. Typically, such solutions are smooth except for singularities supported on
a union of closed submanifolds. Furthermore, geometrically invariant derivatives of the
resulting ﬁelds in the distributional sense signify charges. With this understood, let us
brieﬂy turn attention to equation (50). One wants to avoid holding the reader hostage
to the formal analysis of this elementary equation which might be somewhat distracting.
Thus, I have chosen to brieﬂy describe the solutions qualitatively leaving aside technical
details that can be easily reconstructed aside by the reader. First, one notes that if
ν2 > 0 then a solution is concave, while for ν2 < 0 it will be convex for large values where
2 > −ε2/ν2. Assuming formally that f2 is a function of f ′
f 2
2 (piecewise), one reduces (50)
to the ﬁrst order equation

(51)

dz

q

= ±

c − ν2f 2

2 − ε2 ln f 2
2 .

Thus, there are essentially two types of positive solutions, depending on the actual values
of constants c, ε, ν2. The ﬁrst type includes solutions that assume value 0 at a certain
point z0 and increase monotonously to inﬁnity as z → ∞ as well as the symmetric
solutions deﬁned between −∞ and some point, say z0 again, where they reach 0. These
solutions require ν2 < 0 and they asymptotically look like exp (±(−ν2)1/2z) One can use
both branches in order to put together a strong solution that forms a cusp or a jump
discontinuity at z0. The second type consists of solutions that are concave, rise to the
highest peak at f2 = m, when c − ν2f 2
2 − ε2 ln f 2
2 = 0, and fall oﬀ to 0 on both sides in
ﬁnite time while being diﬀerentiable in-between. Selecting the constants and combining
both types of solutions piecewise segment-by-segment one obtains strong solutions f2 that
in turn provide electric ﬁelds according to formula (48).

Since, with the exception of the trivial constant solution, there are no global smooth
solutions, one concludes that either ~E is constant or there exist charge stripes located at
planes z = const where f2(z) has singularities. The distributional derivative is in each
case equal to the Dirac measure concentrated at z = const as above and scaled by the size
of the jump, and classical derivatives on both sides of the singularity. Even in absence
of a jump, the charge will switch from negative to positive thus forming what can be
amenably called a charge-stripe. An example of this is shown in Fig.1.

It is much more diﬃcult to ﬁgure out solutions of the second equation. I refer the
reader to [13] for a more thorough analysis, while here I will just brieﬂy summarize my

13

previous ﬁndings. Solutions of equation (51) correspond to critical points of the functional

which is neither bounded below nor above, so that one is looking at the problem of ex-
istence of local extrema. The equation always admits a trivial constant solution. But, as
it is shown in [13], it also possesses nontrivial vortex lattice solutions. More precisely, if
β is larger than a certain critical value then there is a nonconstant doubly periodic func-
tion f which satisﬁes the ﬁnite diﬀerence version of (51) everywhere except at a periodic
In this way, a lattice of ﬂux tubes,

the continuous-domain case. However, physical parameters, like
totically independent of the density of discretization. Thus, I conjecture existence of the
continuous domain solutions that satisfy the equation a.e.
in the classical sense and re-
tain the particular vortex morphology. Presently, the essential obstacle to proving this
conjecture is lack of a regularity theory for the discrete vortex solutions. The proof in [13]
is carried out in the (discretized) torus setting. One believes that vortex type solutions
exist on any closed (orientable) surface.

7 Topological Quantum Numbers

Every gauge theory comes equipped with an associated set of topological invariants—
usually characteristic classes of the bundles used to introduce the gauge ﬁeld. Articles [4],
[5], [6] teach us how such topological invariants may be manifested in an electronic system
as observable quantum numbers. The Nonlinear Maxwell Theory is naturally equipped
with two kinds of topological invariants. On one hand, one has the ﬁrst Chern class of the
original U(1)-bundle. Additionally, we will see below that in the case of static solutions
the NM give us an additional set of invariants deﬁned directly by the foliated structure
of the underlying three-manifold. (In the discussion below, I generally assume for the
sake of simplicity that M is a closed orientable manifold unless stated otherwise.)
In
this section I will make an eﬀort only to identify rather than exploit to the fullest the
geometric and topological ramiﬁcations of this nonlinear theory of Electromagnetism. To
gain some initial impetus, let us be guided by the following question

What are the necessary and suﬃcient conditions on a Riemannian three-
manifold M for the NM to admit a separation of variables of the type
seen in the previous section, i.e. for the equation (51) to decouple so that
its solutions will generate magnetic-ﬂux-tube type solutions on M?

A question of this type is typical in algebraic topology where one is asking about global
obstructions to the presence of certain algebraic factorization properties of analytic ob-
jects, like linear diﬀerential equations as it is the case for, say, the de-Rham cohomology
groups. In our case, the equations are nonlinear, but the principle remains the same. The

14

importance of these questions for practical issues of Electromagnetism is twofold. First,
one wants to know how big is the set of possible conﬁgurations—especially in the absence
of the superposition principle. Secondly, I believe the topological invariants displayed
below are directly on target in an eﬀort to explain and describe the nature of certain rigid
structures, like the Quantum Hall Eﬀects, that physically occur in electronic systems.

First, it needs to be emphasized that the static ﬁeld equations I want to consider,
the equations that descend from the four-dimensional spacetime via time-freezing
i.e.
coeﬃcients, are distinct from the equations (1-3) considered directly on a three manifold.
Secondly, the equations (42-46) are only valid on a Euclidean space. The geometry behind
these equations is easier to identify when they are rewritten in an invariant form that can
be considered on any three-manifold in a coordinate independent setting.

Fix a Riemannian metric on M with scalar product < ., . > extended to include
measuring diﬀerential forms. Denote by B and E the forms dual to the magnetic and
electric ﬁeld vectors; recall notation ϕ = ln f and put a = 1. The static NM assume the
form

dE = 0

δB = 0

dB ∧ B = 0

⋆ (⋆dB ∧ E) + (δE)B = − < E, B > dϕ

△ ϕ + |dϕ|2 + |E|2 − |B|2 + ν = 0.

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

Equation (55) is the familiar Frobenious condition on integrability of the distribution of
planes given by ker B. One always assumes B is nonsingular a.e. so that the distribution
is a priori also deﬁned a.e. For convenience, it is assumed throughout this section that
the foliation determined by ker B is smooth. (It is quite clear that for the ﬂux-tube type
solutions the distribution extends through the singular points and is deﬁned everywhere.
At this stage, however, it is hard to make a formal argument to this eﬀect, hence the a
priori assumption.) The condition of smoothness implies that the three-manifold M must
have vanishing Euler characteristic. In particular, singular foliations, some of which may
be associated with other types of solutions of the NM, are excluded from the discussion
below.

It follows that there is a 1-form α, known as the Godbillon-Vey form, such that

This form is not deﬁned uniquely. However, as is well known, d(α ∧ dα) = 0 and the
Godbillon-Vey (GV) cohomology class

is uniquely deﬁned. On a three manifold this class can be evaluated by integration result-
ing in a Godbillon-Vey number

dB = α ∧ B.

This invariant poses many interesting questions that have not been fully resolved by
geometers yet. Below, I will justify two observations. First, the condition of existence
of the magnetic ﬂux-tube solutions imposes both local and global restrictions on the
foliation. Second, magnetic ﬂux-tube solutions exist in topologically nontrivial situations
with nonzero GV-number Q. This is formally summarized in the two propositions that
follow. They are far from the most general statements that can be anticipated in this
direction, but are also nontrivial enough to suggest a conjecture regarding quantization
of the GV-number that I will formulate following Proposition 1.

Consider a priori a foliation given by ker B locally. First, one introduces a local
coordinate patch (x, y, z) such that the foliation is given by the (x, y)-planes and |dz| = 1.
In particular

B = β(x, y, z)dz.

Let γ = g(x, y, z)dx ∧ dy denote the volume element on a leaf. One has ⋆B = β(x, y, z)γ.
Equation (53) becomes d(β(x, y, z)g(x, y, z)dx ∧ dy) = 0. Thus, there is a function χ =
χ(x, y) such that

β(x, y, z) =

χ(x, y)
g(x, y, z)

.

A calculation analogous to that in the previous section shows that the whole system
(53-56) is reduced to

ln

 

χ(x, y)
g(x, y, z) !x

ϕ(x, y, z) = ϕ1(x, y) + ϕ2(z)

it is necessary and suﬃcient that

g = g(x, y),

i.e. a priori dependence of g on z is dropped. If that holds, the equations (58) and (59) can
be decoupled with an additional Ansatz E = e(z)dz. One also has that χ/g = b exp (−ϕ1)
for a constant b and

△x,y ϕ1 + |dϕ1|2 − b2 exp (−2ϕ1) + ν = 0.

Conversely, if (62) and (60) hold, then so must (61) and the mean curvature h of a leaf
vanishes. Indeed, by deﬁnition

h = δ

Proposition 1 For the existence of ﬂux-tube type solutions—in the sense of existence of
factorization (60) and decoupling of equation (62)—it is necessary that the foliation given
by ker B be taut, i.e. the mean curvature of leaves must vanish. In particular π1(M) must
be inﬁnite.

Proof. The ﬁrst part has been shown above. The second part follows from a result of D.
Sullivan [14] that he deduced from the result of Novikov on the existence of a closed leaf
that is a torus (cf. [8], and [16] for additional general material and references).✷

In particular, there are no ﬂux-tube type solutions of the NM that would conform
with the Reeb foliation [9]. This is a practical issue since the Reeb foliation exists on
a solid torus, so that in principle it might be observed experimentally which would be
inconsistent with the theory at hand. This fact is also interesting for another reason.
Namely, according to the celebrated theorem by Thurston in [15] each real number may
be realized as the Godbillon-Vey number for a certain codimension one foliation on the
three-sphere S3. The known proof of this result uses the Reeb foliation in an essential
way.
if the presence of the Reeb foliation
is necessary for the result to hold, but if it turns out to be so then excluding the Reeb
foliation from the game should result in a reduction of the range of the G-V number,
possibly to a discrete subset of the real line.
In such a case, the resulting set of the
G-V numbers accompanying ﬂux-tube type solutions of the NM would also be discrete.
This is consistent with my expectation that these invariants must be related with (both
the integer and the fractional) Quantum Hall Eﬀects. Future research should bring a
resolution of this problem.

I do not know if this fact is canonical, i.e.

Another observation is that the factorization given by (60) and (62) does exist in
topologically nontrivial situations. More precisely, I want to consider solutions of the
NM on P SL(2, R) and its compact factors. These three-manifolds are equipped with
interesting codimension one foliations known as the Roussarie foliation [10]. Let the Lie
algebra sl(2, R) be given by

[X, Y +] = Y +,

[X, Y

[Y +, Y

] = 2X.

Pick a metric on P SL(2, R) in which the corresponding left-invariant vector ﬁelds X, Y +,
and Y − are orthonormal and let µ, ν+, and ν− be the corresponding dual 1-forms. One
checks directly that

dν− = µ ∧ ν−.
so that the distribution ker ν− is integrable and µ is the GV-form of the resulting fo-
In particular, one can introduce local coordinates (x, y, z) such that ∂x = X,
liation.
∂y = Y +, ∂z = Y −. This foliation descends to compact factors of P SL(2, R) that can
each be identiﬁed with T1Mg—the total space of the unit tangent bundle of the hyper-
bolic Riemann surface of genus g that depends on our choice of the co-compact subgroup
acting on P SL(2, R) by isometries. Moreover, the GV-integrand µ ∧ dµ is proportional
to the natural volume form on the three-manifold. As a result of this, the corresponding
GV-numbers

Q =

µ ∧ dµ = −2V ol(Mg)

ZT1Mg

assume values in a discrete set. I want to look for solutions of the NM that satisfy the
Ansatz

In particular, (the Frobenious) equation (55) is satisﬁed automatically. Moreover, since
⋆dB = (Y −β)µ ∧ ν+ ∧ ν−, equation (53) implies

B = βν−.

β = β(x, y).

(63)

(64)

As before, one checks that (54) implies (58) as well as Xϕ = −X ln β and Y +ϕ =
−Y + ln β. In consequence, one again has (60) and assuming E = e(z)ν− as before one
obtains (62). In consequence, the following holds true.

Proposition 2 The Roussarie folitions on P SL(2, R) and its compact factors satisfy the
factorization condition for the existence of magnetic ﬂux-tube type solutions in the sense
that the tangent distribution can be expressed as ker B a.e. and one can reduce the NM
to the form (60-62).

In a similar way one can obtain factorization (60) and (62) for other foliations, like the
natural foliation on say S2 × S1.

8 More on the Physical Framework of the NM

It is natural to ask if the NM descend from a Lagrangian functional depending on the
two variables A and f , say Φ(A, f ), via the Euler-Lagrange calculus of variations. The
answer is negative as one can easily see considering that in general a gradient must pass
the second derivative test:

δ2
δAδf

Φ =

δ2
δf δA

Φ

δA Φ, δ

—a condition that cannot be satisﬁed by the expressions in (1-3) viewed as the gradient,
say ( δ
δf Φ), of an unknown functional Φ. This suggests that the NM may constitute
just a part of a broader theory that would encompass additional physical ﬁelds. In other
words, the equations (1-3) would have to be coupled to some other equations via additional
ﬁelds. In addition, such coupling would have to induce only a very small perturbation of
the present picture that one believes is essentially accurate. Such possibilities may become
more accessible in the future. Among other, perhaps related goals is that of deriving the
NM equation directly from the microscopic principles.

The well-known analogy between the Quantum Hall Eﬀects and High-Tc Supercon-
ductivity suggests that there should exist vortex lattices involving the so-called ﬁlling
factor (microlocally a constant scalar) that plays a major role in the description of Com-
posite Particles. The NM describe exactly this type of a vortex-lattice. Simulation and
theory show that this system conforms with the experimentally observed physical facts.
It stretches the domain of applicability of the Maxwell theory to encompass phenom-
ena such as the Magnetic Oscillations, Magnetic Vortices, Charge Stripes that occur in
low-temperature electronic systems exposed to high magnetic ﬁelds.

18

There are other systems of PDE that admit vortex-lattice solutions and are conceptu-
ally connected with Electromagnetism, like the well known Ginzburg-Landau equations
valid within the framework of low Tc type-II superconductivity, or the Chern-Simons ex-
tension of these equations which, some researchers have suggested, may be more relevant
to the Fractional Quantum Hall Eﬀect and/or High-Tc Superconductivity, cf.
[18]. The
free variables of these equations are the so-called order parameter (a section of a com-
plex line-bundle) and a U(1)-principal connection, both of them containing topological
information. In the case of NM, all the topological information is contained in one of the
variables, i.e. the principal connection, while the other is a scalar function. An additional
advantage of the NM is in that it remains meaningful in three-plus-one dimensions just
as well as in the two-dimensional setting. I would also like to mention that recently other
researchers have introduced nonlinear Maxwell equations of another type in the context
of the Quantum Hall Eﬀects, cf. [3]. The NM theory presented in this and the preceding
articles of mine is of a diﬀerent nature. Finally, although this is far from my areas of
expertise and the remark should be received as completely ad hoc, I would also like to
mention that yet another context in which foliations come in touch with the Quantum
Hall Eﬀect is that of noncommutative geometry, cf. [1].

Let me conclude with a question that may suggest yet another point of view. Namely,
is there a coalescence between the nonlinear PDEs (in the form of the NM) and the
(Quantum) Information Theory? As it was pointed out, construction of error correcting
codes may unavoidably require manipulating quantum information at the topological
level. Anyhow, this is how I have understood the essential thought in [2]. Adopting this
paradigm would strongly suggest that the eﬀective language of quantum computation
should be costructed at many levels, including that of the mesoscopic ﬁeld theory in
parallel with the language derrived from the basic principles as it is done now. Future
research will likely better clarify these issues.

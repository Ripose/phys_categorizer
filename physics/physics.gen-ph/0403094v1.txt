Abstract

The distinction between the real positions of moving objects in a single reference
frame and the apparent positions of objects at rest in one inertial frame and viewed
from another, as predicted by the space-time Lorentz Transformations, is discussed.
It is found that in the Rockets-and-String paradox the string remains unstressed
and does not break and that the pole in the Barn-and-Pole paradox never actually
ﬁts into the barn. The close relationship of the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction and
the relativity of simultaneity of Special Relativlty is pointed out and an associated
paradox, in which causality is apparently violated, is noted .

Introduction

One of the most important new physical insights given in Einstein’s seminal paper on
Special Relativity (SR) [1] was the realisation that the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction
(LFC), which had previously been interpreted by Lorentz and Poincar´e as an electro-
dynamical eﬀect, was most easily understood as a simple consequence of the space-time
Lorentz Transformation (LT), i.e. as a geometrical eﬀect [2].

It was pointed out 54 years later by Terrell [3] and Penrose [4] that when other im-
portant physical eﬀects (light propagation time delays and optical aberration) are taken
into account, as well as the LT, the moving sphere considered by Einstein in the 1905 SR
paper would not appear to be ﬂattened, in the direction of motion, into an ellipsoid, as
suggested by Einstein, but rather would appear undistorted, but rotated. Shortly after-
wards, Weinstein [5] pointed out that the LFC of a moving rod is apparent only if it is
viewed in a direction strictly perpendicular to its direction of motion. It appears instead
to be relatively elongated if moving towards the observer, and to be more contracted
than the LFC eﬀect if moving away from him. These eﬀects are a consequence of light
propagation time delays. A review [6] has discussed in some detail the combined eﬀects
of the LT, light propagation delays and optical aberration on the appearence of moving
objects and clocks.

Another paper by the present author [7] pointed out that, in addition to the well-known
LFC and Time Dilatation (TD) eﬀects corresponding, respectively, to t = constant and
x′ = constant projections of the LT, two other apparent distortions of space-time may be
considered: Time Contraction (TC) and Space Dilatation (SD) corresponding to the two
remaining projections, x = constant and t′ = constant, respectively, of the LT 1.

The apparent nature of spatial distortions resulting from the LT is made evident by
comparing the LFC with SD. In the former case the moving object appears shorter, in
the latter longer, than the length as observed in its proper frame. Similarly, in TD, a
moving clock appears to run slower than a similar clock at rest, while in TC identical
moving clocks observed at a ﬁxed position appear to be running faster than a similar,
stationary, clock. A dynamical explanation has been proposed [8] for the LFC eﬀect in
the case of an extended object bound by electromagnetic forces, and of TD [9] in the
case of various ‘electromagnetic clocks’. No attempt has been made, to date, to ﬁnd a
dynamical explanation of the TC and SD eﬀects. It is hard to see, in any case, how any
‘dynamical’ explanation can be given for the LFC of the proper distance between two
isolated material objects in a common inertial frame, whereas, as ﬁrst shown by Einstein,
this is a simple space-time geometric consequence of the LT. As will be discussed below,
one important reason for the misinterpretation of the ‘Rockets-and String paradox’ [10]
is the incorrect assumption that extended objects undergo a ‘dynamical’ LFC that is
diﬀerent from that of the distance between two discrete objects.

The ‘Rockets-and-String’ and ‘Pole-and-Barn’ [11] as well as the similar ‘Man-and-
Grid’ [12] and ‘Rod-and-Hole’ [13] paradoxes have all been extensively used in text

motion along their common x-axis

books on SR, for example in Taylor and Wheeler [14] and, more recently, by Tipler
and Lewellyn [15]. In all cases the apparent LFC eﬀects are correctly derived from the
LT equations, but it seems to be nowhere realised that the ‘real’ positions and size of
moving objects, in the sense that will be described below in Section 2, are diﬀerent from
the apparent ones derived from the LT. Indeed, the general assumption, in all of the
papers and books just cited seems to be that there is no distinction between the real and
apparent sizes and positions of moving objects, or, equivalently, that the LFC is a ‘real’
eﬀect. The purpose of the present paper is to point out that this is not the case and that
the ‘real’ and ‘apparent’ (i.e., those calculated using the LT) positions of moving objects
are, indeed, distinct. The origin of this confusion between ‘real’ and ‘apparent’ positions
and sizes of moving objects is not clear to the author. There is nothing in Einstein’s
1905 SR paper to suggest that the LFC should be considered as a ‘real’ rather than an
‘apparent’ eﬀect. Speciﬁcally, Einstein wrote [16]:

Thus, whereas the X and Z dimensions of the sphere (and therefore every

rigid body of no matter what form) do not appear modified by the motion,
the X dimension appears shortened in the ratio 1 :
greater the value of v the greater the shortening.

The plan of this paper is as follows: The following Section discusses the real positions
of objects as observed or measured in a single reference frame. Section 3 describes the ap-
parent spatial positions of objects in uniform motion as predicted by the LT. The Rockets-
and-String and Barn-and-Pole paradoxes are discussed in Sections 4 and 5 respectively.
In Section 6, the close connection between the LFC and the relativity of simultaneity of
SR is described and a new paradox of SR is pointed out. Section 7 contains a summary
and conclusions.

2 The Real Positions of Moving Objects

The ‘real’ positions of one or more moving objects are deﬁned here as those speciﬁed,
for the diﬀerent objects, in a single frame of reference. The latter may be either inertial, or
with an arbitary accelerated motion. By introducing the concept of a co-moving inertial
frame, at any instant of the accelerated motion, the distance between the objects can
always be deﬁned as the proper distance between them in a certain inertial frame. If this
distance in the diﬀerent co-moving inertial frames is constant the ‘real’ distance is said
to be constant. No distinction is made between the real distance between the points on a
rigid extended object and that between discrete, physically separated, objects coincident
in space-time with these points. This is because the LT, that relates only space-time
events in diﬀerent inertial frames, treats, in an identical manner, points on extended or
discrete physical objects.

The utility of the science of the ‘real’ positions of moving objects (astronomy, railways,

Units are chosen with c = 1. Also L = a = 1, tacc = √3.

military ballistics, air traﬃc control, space travel, GPS satellites...) is evident and the
validity of the basic physical concepts introduced by Galileo (distance, time, velocity and
acceleration) are not aﬀected, in any way, by SR. The ‘real’ positions of objects in a given
reference frame are those which must be known to, for example, avoid collisions between
moving objects in the case of railway networks, or, on the contrary, to assure them in the
case of military ballistics or space-travel. From now on, in this paper, the words ‘real’
and ‘apparent’ will be written without quotation marks.

For clarity, a deﬁnite measuring procedure to establish the real distance between two
moving objects in a given frame of observation is introduced. This will be useful later
when discussing the Barn-and-Pole paradox. Suppose that the objects considered move
along the positive x-axis of an inertial coordinate system S. The co-moving inertial frame
of the objects is denoted by S’. It is imagined that two parallel light beams cross the
x-axis in S, at right angles, at a distance ℓ apart. Each light beam is viewed by a photo-
cell and the moving objects are equipped with small opaque screens that block the light
beams during the passage of the objects. Two objects, O1 and O2, with x(O2) > x(O1),
moving with the same uniform velocity, v, will then interrupt, in turn, each of the light
beams. Suppose that the photo-cells in the forward (F) and backward (B) beams are
equipped with clocks that measure the times of extinction of the beams to be (in an
obvious notation) t(F 1), t(F 2), t(B1) and t(B2)2. Consideration of the motion of the
2‘forward’ and ‘backward’ are deﬁned from the viewpoint of the moving objects. Thus the forward

beam lies nearest to the origin of the x-axis

where L is the real distance between the moving objects. Eqns(2.1) and (2.2) give the

Equations (2.4),(2.5),(2.8) and (2.9) show that any three of the four time measurements
are suﬃcient to determine the real separation, L, between the two moving objects. In
these equations the times: t(F 2), t(B1), t(F 1) and t(B2), respectively, are not used to
determine L. In order to combine all four time measurements to obtain the best, unbiased,
determinations of v and L, Eqns(2.1) and (2.2) may be added to obtain:

It is interesting to note that the real spatial positions, as well as the instantaneous
velocity and acceleration, at any time, of two objects subjected to a symmetric, uniform,
acceleration in the frame S, can also be determined from the four time measurements
just considered. In this case there is no redundancy, the time measurements determine
four equations which may be solved for the four quantites just mentioned. In the case
of uniform motion, the constant velocity hypothesis may be checked by comparing the
independent determinations of v provided by Eqns(2.1) and (2.2). Furthermore, as al-
ready mentioned, any three of the four time measurements is suﬃcient to determine L.
Evidently, if t(F 1) = t(B2), then L = ℓ in the case of an arbitary accelerated motion of
the two objects. Thus, by varying ℓ, the real distance between the co-moving objects can
be determined even if the acceleration program of their co-moving frame is not known.

The two objects, moving with equal and constant velocities along the x-axis in S,
discussed above, are now considered to be set in motion by applying identical acceleration
programs to two objects initially at rest and lying along the x-axis in S. The two objects
considered are then, by deﬁnition, subjected to the same acceleration program in their
common rest frame, or, what is the same thing, their common rest frame, (with respect to
which the two objects are, at all times, at rest) is accelerated. Under these circumstances
the distance between the objects remains constant in the instantaneous co-moving inertial
frame of the objects. At the start of the acceleration procedure, the instantaneous co-
moving inertial frame is S, at the end of the acceleration procedure it is S’. Therefore
the separation of the objects in S at the start of the acceleration procedure is the same
as that in S’ at the end of it. Note that there is no distinction between the real and
apparent distances between objects at rest in the same inertial frame. Also ‘relativity of
simultaneity’ can play no role, since the proper time of both objects is always referred to
the same co-moving inertial frame. Since the acceleration program of both objects starts
at the same time in S, and both objects execute identical space time trajectories, the real
separation of the objects must also remain constant. This necessarily follows from space-
time geometry. Similarly, since the acceleration program stops at the same time in S’ for
both objects the real separation of the objects remains constant in this frame and equal
to the original separation of the objects in S. This behaviour occurs for any symmetric
acceleration program, and is shown, for the special case of a constant acceleration in the
rest frame of the objects (to be calculated in detail below), in Fig 1. Since, in the above
discussion, both objects are always referred to the same inertial frame there is no way
that SR can enter into the discussion and change any of the above conclusions. Indeed,
SR is necessary to derive the correct form of the separate space-time trajectories in S and
S’, but the symmetry properties that guarantee the equalites of the real separations of
the objects cannot be aﬀected, in any way, by SR eﬀects.

Two objects, O1 and O2, originally lying at rest along the x-axis in S and separated
by a distance L are now simultaneously accelerated, during a ﬁxed time period, tacc, in
S, starting at t = 0, with constant acceleration, a, in their common proper frame, up

The origins of S and S’ have been chosen to coincide at t = t′ = 0. The real positions of the
objects in S, S’ are shown, as a function of t and t′ respectively, for a = 1 and tacc = √3,
in Fig.1a,b. The velocities of the two objects are equal at all times in both frames, as
are also the real separations of the objects x2
x′1 = L. SR is used only to
derive Eqns(2.17) and (2.26). The time-varying velocity in each frame is then integrated
according to the usual rules of classical dynamics in order to obtain Eqns(2.18),(2.19) and
(2.27),(2.28) for the positions of the objects, in each frame, during acceleration. These
are, by deﬁnition, the real positions of the objects O1 and O2 in S and S’ respectively. The
equalities of the velocities and the constant real separations are a direct consequence of
the assumed initial conditions and the similarity of the proper frame accelerations of the
objects. These are the sets of equations that must be used to specify the distance between
O1 and O2 and any other objects whose real positions are speciﬁed in S or S’, in order to
predict collisions or other space-time interactions of the objects. It is important to stress
that the real positions and times in S (equations (2.21) and (2.22)) and S’ (equation
(2.30)), in the phase of uniform motion following acceleration, are not
related by the
space-time LT equations. Also, the times over which the acceleration program is applied
are observed to be equal to √3/a in both S and S’. These time intervals are not related by
the time dilatation formula of SR. The apparent positions and times of space-time events
in one inertial frame, as observed from another, according to the LT, are discussed in the
following Section.

3 The Apparent Positions of Moving Objects in Spe-

cial Relativity

In order to account correctly for the actual appearence of moving objects, not only the
LT but also the eﬀects of light propagation delays to the observer, and optical aberration
must be properly taken into account. In the following, it is supposed that the necessary
corrections for the two latter eﬀects have been made, so that only consequences of the LT
are discussed. In this case the apparent position xA in a ‘stationary’ inertial frame, S, at
time3, t, of an event at x′, t′ in the inertial frame, S’, moving with velocity v along the
positive x-axis in S, is given by the space-time LT:

xA = γ(x′ + vt′)
vx′
c2 )

t = γ(t′ +

(3.1)

(3.2)

In Eqns(3.1) and (3.2), clocks in S and S’ synchronised so as to record the same time at
t = t′ = 0 when xA = x′ = 0.

Since ‘observation’ implies the interaction, with a detection apparatus, of one or more
photons, originating from the observed object, it is convenient to deﬁne the space-time
events that are related by the LT to correspond, in S’, to the points of emission (or
reﬂection) of a photon from a source at rest, and in S to the space-time point at which the
emission or reﬂection of this photon is observed. It is assumed that, after the acceleration
3Notice that there is no possible distinction between the ‘time’ and the ‘apparent time’ in the frame

S. t is simply the time recorded by a synchronised local clock in S.

7

procedure described in the previous Section4, the frame S’ moves with constant velocity
v = V along the x-axis of S. How the object will appear when viewed from S, depends on
which photons, scattered from or emitted by the object, are selected by the observer. In
the case of the LFC discussed by Einstein [1] the observer in S requires that the photons
emitted from O1 and O2 are observed simultaneously in S (the ∆t = 0 projection of the
LT). As is easily derived from Eqns(3.1) and (3.2), the separation of the two objects then
appears to be L/γ where L is their real separation in S’. Another simple possibility [7] is to
require that the two objects are both illuminated for a very short period of time in their
proper frame, yielding a ‘transient luminous object’. In this case, a quite complicated
series of events is observed in S. A line image (whose width depends on the period of
illumination) is seen to move with velocity c/β in the same direction as that of the moving
object, sweeping out a total length γL. This is the so-called ‘Space Dilatation’ (SD) eﬀect
(the ∆t′ = 0 projection of the LT) [7]. As discussed in more detail below, both the LFC
and TD eﬀects are direct consequences of the ‘relativity of simultaneity’ of SR introduced
by Einstein. In both LFC and TD, the space-time events in S’ are associated with the real
positions of the objects, as deﬁned above, in this frame. However, since it is clear that the
apparent positions of these space-time events, as observed in S, depend upon the mode
of observation, being diﬀerent for the LFC and TD, they evidently cannot be identiﬁed
with the real positions of the objects in this frame. The relation of the real and apparent
positions will now be discussed in detail for the two ‘paradoxes’ of SR mentioned above.

4 The Rockets-and-String Paradox

The idea that the LFC could induce mechanical stress in a moving extended body
was introduced by Dewan and Beran [10], criticised by Nawrocki [20] and defended by
Dewan [11] and Romain [21]. Dewan and Beran discussed symmetric acceleration of two
rockets, originally at rest in the frame S, in a way very similar to the acceleration of the
two objects O1 and O2 described in Section 2 above, except that no speciﬁc acceleration
program was deﬁned. It was correctly concluded that the real distance between the objects
in S would remain unchanged throughout the aceleration procedure. However, it was not
stated that, after acceleration, the proper separation between the rockets is the same
as their original separation in S. Dewan and Beran then introduced a continous string
attached between the rockets during the acceleration and drew a distinction between two
distances:

(a) the distance between two ends of a connected rod and (b) the
distance between two objects which are not connected but each of which
independently and simultaneously moves with the same velocity with respect
to an inertial frame

It was then stated (without any supporting argument) that the distance (a) is subject
to the LFC and (b) not. Replacing the ‘connected rod’ of (a) by a continous string
attached between the rockets, it was concluded that the string would be stressed and
ultimately break, since the distance between the rockets does not change, whereas the

Thus t, t′ and x′ are deﬁned diﬀerently in these equations than in Section 2 above

8

string shrinks due to the LFC. Several correct arguments were given why the real distance
between the rockets does not change. The incorrect conclusion that the string would be
stressed and break was due to the failure to discriminate between the real separation of
the rockets (correctly calculated) and the apparent contraction due to the LFC, which as
correctly pointed out by Nawrocki [20] applies equally to the distance between the ends of
the string and that between the points on the rockets to which it is attached. Dewan and
Beran’s distinction between the distances (a) and (b) is then wrong. Both the distance
between the points of attachment of the string and the length of the string undergo the
same apparent LFC. There is no stress in the string. It does not break.

Dewan did not respond to Nawrocki’s objection that (correctly) stated the equivalence
of the length of an extended object and the distance between two independant objects
separated by a distance equal to this length, but instead introduced a new argument,
claiming that Nawrocki had not correctly taken into account the relativity of simultaneity
of SR. Dewan considered the sequence of events corresponding to the ﬁring of the rockets
as observed in S’, the co-moving frame of the rockets after acceleration. It was concluded
that the spring breaks because, in this case, the ﬁnal separation of the rockets is γL (this
is just the SD eﬀect described above). But for this, the LT must be applied to space time
events on the rockets (and not to the string), whereas when considering an observer in
S, Dewan and Beran had applied the LT to the string (and not to the rockets)! Viewed
from S’ both the distance between the rockets and the length of the string undergo the
apparent SD eﬀect, there is no stress in the string and it does not break.

All of the confusion and wrong conclusions in References [10] and [11] result, ﬁrstly,
from the failure to notice the strict equivalence of separations of type (a) and (b) and
secondly from not realising that the apparent and real separations of the moving rockets
are not the same. Even Nawrocki, who correctly pointed out the fallacy of assigning
the LFC to separations of type (a) but not to type (b) seems not to have realised the
correctness of Dewan and Beran’s calculation of the real distance between the rockets.
He correctly stated that the apparent contractions of the length of the string and the
distance between the rockets would be the same, but did not discriminate this apparent
distance from the real separation of the rockets in the frame S.

The acceleration program discussed in Section 2 above (and indeed any programme
which is an arbitary function of proper time) when applied in a symmetrical manner to
the two objects O1 and O2, will leave unchanged the proper separation of the objects in
their co-moving frame. On the other hand. the ‘instantaneous’ acceleration considered by
Dewan apparently resulted in a change in the proper separation of the rockets. If Dewan
had considered instead a physically realistic acceleration program, such as that discussed
in Section 2 above (which must necessarily occupy a ﬁnite period of time) no change in
the proper separation of the rockets in their co-moving frame would have been predicted.
This is shown in Fig.1b above. In fact, Dewan did not consider the whole acceleration
process, but instead calculated the apparent positions in S’, according to the LT, of the
space-time events corresponding to the ﬁring of the rockets in S, i.e. the start of the
acceleration programme. These apparent positions are not the same as the real positions
of the rockets in S’. The apparent length of a rod uniformly accelerated in its proper
co-moving frame has recently been calculated by Nikolic [19]. It was correctly noted in
this paper, contrary to the conclusion of Dewan, that the real length of the rod remains

unchanged in this frame.

In a comment on Reference [10], Evett and Wagness [22] stated that the distance
between the rockets, given by Dewan and Beran as that between the tail of the ﬁrst
rocket and the head of the second, would not remain constant in S, due to the LFC of
the rockets, whereas the distance between any two corresponding points would, Thus, like
Dewan and Beran, Evett and Wagness assumed that extended material objects (rockets,
strings) undergo the LFC, but not the spatial separation of the rockets in their co-moving
frame. Thus Evett and Wagness also stated that the string will break. Actually, the
real lengths of the rockets as well as the distance between them, in the frame S, remain
unchanged during acceleration, but, as correctly stated by Nawrocki, they both undergo
the apparent LFC.

In Section 3 of Reference [11] Dewan considered an observer at rest in the co-moving
frame of the accelerated rocket, R2, with the smallest x-coordinate. He concluded that,
viewed from this frame, the second rocket, R1, would have a non-vanishing velocity in
the x-direction that stresses the string and causes it to break. Such behaviour is clearly
in contradiction with the assumed symmetry of the acceleration program. At any instant
the two rockets have a common co-moving frame within which their relative velocity is
zero. Dewan’s argument was later supported by Romain [21] who considered a constant
acceleration of the rockets in their co-moving proper frame as in Eqns.(2.17)-(2.19) above.
This conclusion however was founded on a misinterpretation of the space-time diagram
(Fig.1 of Reference [21]) describing the motion of the rockets. In reference to this ﬁgure it
was incorrectly stated that ‘B2B′1 and A2A1 represent the same “proper length” ’. In fact,
1
the proper separation of the rockets in the frame S’ (with space and time coordinates X ′
4) corresponding to the space-time point B2, on the trajectory of R2, in the frame
and X ′
S (with space and time coordinates X 1 and X 4) is represented by the distance between
1 axis with the tangent to the trajectory of R1 at B1
B2 and the intersection of the X ′
(say, the point Bt
1) not B2B′1. The latter is the distance between B2 and the intersection
1 axis with the trajectory of R1. The apparent distance in S corresponding to the
of the X ′
4 = 0 projection) is found to be γB2B1 so that, from the SD eﬀect
segment B2Bt
described in Section 3 above, the proper separation of the rockets in S’ is B2B1 = A2A1,
i.e. the same as their initial separation in S. Thus it is the segment B2Bt
1, not B2B′1, that
represents the same proper length as A2A1. Since the velocity in S of R1 at B′1 is greater
than that of R2 at B2, Romain was lead to the same erroneous conclusion as Dewan,
that the proper distance between the rockets is increasing, causing the string to break. It
may be noted that this conclusion is actually in contradiction with Romain’s own (but
incorrect) statement that A2A1 and B2B′1 represent the same proper length! Although
Romain did not discriminate between the real and apparent positions of the rockets, it
may be remarked that the trajectories A2C2, A1C1 in Fig.1 of Reference [21] actually
represent the real positions of the rockets in S as discussed in Section 2 above. This ﬁgure
is thus similar to Fig.1a of the present paper. Also the distance B2Bt
1 represents, in S’,
the constant (real) separation of the rockets R1, R2 in their common co-moving inertial
frame.

1 (a ∆X ′

The apparent positions of the similarly accelerated rockets were later discussed by
Evett [23]. No distinction was made between the real and apparent positions of the
rockets and, unlike Romain, no deﬁnite acceleration procedure was deﬁned. Like Dewan,

10

a misinterpretation of the space time events corresponding to the ﬁring of the rockets,
as observed from their ﬁnal inertial frame, lead to the erroneous conclusion that the real
separation of the rockets in this frame is diﬀerent from the initial one before acceleration.

What is essentially the ‘Rockets-and-String Paradox’ has been recently re-discussed
by Tartaglia and Ruggiero [24], although no reference was made, in their paper, to the
previous literature on the subject discussed in the present paper. As in Section 2 above,
the case of two objects (spatially independent or connected by a spring), subjected to
an idential uniform acceleration in their proper frames, as in Section 2 above, was con-
sidered, as well as that of an extended object (rod) subjected to a similar acceleration
program. No distinction was made between the real and apparent positions of the objects
considered, and no calculations using the space-time LT were performed. Exactly the
same error as that of Dewan and Beran was made by introducing an incorrect distinction
between the spatial interval between the ends of a connected rod and that between two
spatially disconnected objects situated at the same spatial positions as the ends of the
rod. Thus, it was concluded that the accelerated rod would be length contracted by an
amount determined by its instantaneous velocity in S, as well as undergoing mechanical
deformation due to elastic stress generated by the accelarating force. No calculations were
performed, or arguments given, to justify this conclusion; it is simply stated that:

The length seen by O is obtained from l′ projectiong it from the x’ axis
v2/c2, according

multiplying by

(the space of O’) to the x axis, i.e.
to the standard Lorentz contraction.

q

−

Thus here, Tartaglia and Ruggiero were referring to the apparent, not the real, length
of the rod. In the case of two independent, and similarly accelerated, objects, the real tra-
jectories in S were correctly described, as in Eqns(2.14)-(2.22) above, and it was correctly
stated that the separation of the objects remains constant in this frame. The real sepa-
ration was, however, confused with the apparent separation between the objects, since it
was then stated, again, without any supporting argument or calculation, that:

.....the proper distance in the frame of the rockets, l0, has
progressively increased during the acceleration so that the Lorentz
contraction (l = γ−

1l0) produces precisely the l result.

The general arguments and detailed calculations presented in Section 2 above clearly
show that this statement is incorrect. There is no change in the separation of the objects
in their co-moving inertial frame during the acceleration procedure. In the case when the
two objects are connected by a spring, Tartaglia and Ruggiero incorrectly argued that
the spring, being an extended object, undergoes Lorentz contraction whereas the spatial
separation between the objects does not, thus inducing tension in the spring. It is then
argued that:

The consequence will be that the actual acceleration of the front end
will be a little bit less than what the engine alone would produce and the
acceleration at the rear end will be a little bit more for the same reason.
In this way, the proper times of the two engineers will no longer be the
same at a given coordinate time and the two world lines of the ends of the
spring will no longer be equal hyperbolae (see figure 2).

11

Since, in fact, there is no distinction for the LT, between the space interval between
points on spatially separated objects, or an equal interval between points on a spatially
extended object, there is no ‘relativistic tension’, generated in the spring, to give rise
to the diﬀerent accelerations of the two objects as conjectured in Reference [24]. Since
the distances between the ends of the rod, the two spatially separated objects or the
two connected objects remain always constant in the co-moving inertial frame, during
the acceleration procedure, it follows that in all three cases considered in Reference [24],
the real distance, in S, between the moving objects (except for some possible elastic
deformation in the case of the accelerated rod) will be the same as that shown in Fig.1
of Reference [24]. This ﬁgure is similar to Fig. 1a of the present paper or Fig. 1 of
Reference [21]. Fig. 2 of Reference [24] is therefore incorrect. Finally, it may be noted
that the apparent length of a uniformly accelerated rod has been calculated by Nikolic [19].
The result obtained does not agree with the naive generalisation of the Lorentz contraction
formula as given after Eqn(3) in Reference [24].

described in Section 2 above, to the inertial frame S’, co-moving with the objects. Units

length of the barn is 0.5 + δ, where δ is a small number, then, due to the LFC, the
apparent positions of O1 and O2, viewed in S, will, at some time, both ﬁt into the barn.
This example was introduced by Dewan [11], at the end of the paper written in reply to
Nawrocki’s objections to Dewan and Beran’s ‘Rockets-and-String paradox’ paper. Dewan
also imagined that the doors of the barn might be closed when the pole was inside, and
that if the pole was suddenly stopped by the closed back door of the barn, the rod would
revert to its original proper length, thus crashing through the closed front door of the
barn (Figs.1 and 2 of Reference [11]).

In the associated ‘paradox’ Dewan supposes that a pole vaulter is running along car-

rying the pole:

The pole vaulter, on the other hand, would see the barn as contracted

and much smaller than the pole.
vaulter explain the fact that the door can be closed behind him?

The question is, how can the pole

All of the above takes for granted that the pole is really, not apparently, contracted in
the frame S. However, the actual situation during the passage of the pole (i.e the objects
O1 and O2) through the barn, is shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4. In Figs.2a,b the real and
apparent positions of O1 and O2, as a function of time, are shown in S and S’ respectively.
The clocks in S and S’ are synchronised at the moment that the mid-point of O1 and O2
is situated at the middle of the barn. The real positions in S of O1 and O2, as calculated
in Section 2 above, are indicated by the full lines, the apparent positions, due to the LFC,
by the dashed ones. The real and apparent positions of the barn (at rest in S), as viewed
from S’ are similarly indicated. It is quite clear that at t = t′ = 0, when the mid-point
between O1 and O2 co-incides with that of the barn, O2 is already beyond the back door
and O1 still before the front door. At no time are both objects inside the barn at the
same time, so that the doors cannot be closed with them both inside. The passage of the
objects through the barn is shown in more detail in Fig.3 (as viewed in S) and in Fig.4 (as
viewed in S’). The real and apparent positions of the objects are shown as cross-hatched
and open squares respectively. The times at which the objects apparently enter and leave
the barn are shown in Table 1 for S and Table 2 for S’. Assuming that the barn is slightly
longer than the Lorentz-contracted distance between the objects, it can be seen that, for
a short period of time, both objects will appear to be inside the barn, as viewed from
S, but that this is never the case for an observer in S’. Thus the apparent object ‘barn
with the doors closed and both objects inside’ exists for an observer in S, but not for
one in S’. This might be possible for the apparent positions, but must evidently lead to
a contradiction if the ‘barn with the doors closed and both objects inside’ is associated
with a real physical object, as was done by Dewan.

The paradox was discussed in Reference [14] where it was pointed out that, due to the
relativity of simultaneity, and as can be seen in Fig.4 and Table 2, for an observer in S’,
√3/4 (Fig.4b) before O1 enters it at t′ = √3/4 (Fig.4d).
O2 will leave the barn at t′ =
If the (apparent) doors of barn close at these instants (and the barn is slightly longer
than 0.5 units) then O2 will be inside the barn when the front door closes, and O1 will
be inside when back door closes, as also seen by an observer in S. It was not pointed out,
however, in Reference [14] that the observer in S’, unlike the one in S, never sees both
objects in the barn at the same instant. The times at which the moving objects really

−

15

enter and leave the barn in S are shown in Table 3. The corresponding times in S’ are
simply given by the replacement t

t′.

→

In conclusion, the situation shown in Figs.1 and 2 of Reference [11] is a physically
impossible one. The pole can never, at any time, really ﬁt into the barn. As in the
case of the Rockets-and-String paradox it has been incorrectly assumed that the apparent
Lorentz contracted length of the pole in S is equal to its real length (as deﬁned in Section
2 above) in this frame.

The real separation of the moving objects in S could be measured, as described in
Section 2 above, by a parallel pair of light beams, perpendicular to the direction of motion
of the objects, situated at the positions of the doors of the barn. Substituting the real
times of passage of the objects given in Table 3 into Eqn.(2.13) gives their real separation:
L = 2ℓ = 1 unit.

6 The Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction and the Rela-

tivity of Simultaneity

It is interesting to consider the sequence of space-time events, in the frames S, S’,
which take place when the simultaneous observation is made in S of two objects, at rest
in S’, that yields the LFC. The correspondence, via the LT Eqns(3.1) and (3.2) of the
relevant space-time events in S and S’ is presented in Table 4 and shown in Fig.5.

−

When the mid-point of two objects O1 and O2 considered in the previous Section (the
origin, O’, of S’) passes the center of the barn (corresponding to the origin, O, of S) the
clocks in the frames are synchronised such that t = t′ = 0. The apparent and real positions
of the objects, at this time, in S are as shown in Fig.5b. E1 and E2 represent space-time
events coincident with the observation of single photons from O1 and O2 respectively, that
are both observed at t = 0 in S. According to the LT, the photon from O1 is emitted in
S’ at the later time t′ = βL/2c (event E′1 in Fig.5c), and that from O2 at the earlier time
t′ =
βL/2c (event E′2 in Fig.5a), than the time (t′ = 0) of observation of the photons
in S. As before, L is the separation of the objects in S’. The position of the origin of S’
in S measures directly t′ via the relation, derived from Eqn(3.1), t′ = xA
O′/γv.
As can be seen in Fig.5 and from the entries in Table 4, the real position of O’ in S
(mid-way between the real positions of O1 and O2) coincides with its apparent position,
as calculated using Eqn(3.1), at all times. The real positions of O1 and O2 at the time,
γβL/2c, at which the observed photon (event E2) is emitted from
t′ =
O2, are shown in Fig.5a. As above, γ = 2, β = √3/2, L = c = 1 are assumed. Similarly
Fig.5c shows the real positions of the objects at the time t′ = βL/2c, or t = γβL/2c, at
which the observed photon (event E1) is emitted from O1. It can be seen from Fig.5b that
the apparent position of O2 in S, at t = 0, is shifted, relative to its real position, towards
negative values of x, i.e. in the direction of the real position of O2 at the instant that the
corresponding photon was emitted in S’. Similarly, the apparent position of O1 in S, at
t = 0, is shifted towards positive values, i.e. also towards its real position in S at the time
that the corresponding photon was emitted in S’. The combination of these shifts gives

the LFC. It is a direct consequence of the relativity of simultaneity of the events observed
in S and S’. However, the apparent positions of the objects in S do not correspond to the
real positions of the objects at the times that the photons were emitted in S’, as might
naively be expected. In fact it can be seen from the entries in Table 4 that at the time
γβL/2c, at which the photon observed at E2 is emitted in S’, the real position of

The same distance separates the apparent position of O1 at t = 0 from its real position
at the time, t1 = γβL/2c, at which the photon was emitted from O1 in S’. Table 4 and
Fig.5 show that the photon from O2 is predicted by the LT to be observed in S at a time
γβL/2c later than that corresponding to its emission time in S’, whereas the photon from
O1 is predicted to be observed in S at a time γβL/2c before O1 reaches the position at
which the photon is emitted. The latter conclusion seems indeed paradoxical
[25] and
merits further reﬂection.

A similar consideration of the Space Dilatation eﬀect shows that this is also follows
directly from the relativity of simultaneity. Making a ∆t′ = 0 projection in S’ gives
corresponding non-simultaneous events in S, spatially separated by the distance γL (see
Table 1 of Reference [7]).

7 Summary and Conclusions

The real positions of moving objects within a single frame of reference are calculated
by the well-known rules, based on the concepts of spatial position, time, velocity and

18

acceleration, as ﬁrst clearly set down by Galileo. Special Relativity which instead relates,
via the LT, space-time events in diﬀerent inertial frames, has no relevance to the cal-
culation of the relative positions of diﬀerent moving objects in a single reference frame.
The diﬀerent apparent sizes of extended objects, or distances between discrete objects,
predicted by the LT for diﬀerent modes of observation, e.g. the LFC (∆t = 0 projection)
or SD (∆t′ = 0 projection) manifest the truly apparent (i.e. observation mode dependent)
nature of these phenomena.

The incorrect conclusion concerning the Rockets-and-String paradox presented till
now in the literature resulted from, on the one hand, a failure to distinguish between the
(correctly calculated) real positions of the rockets and the apparent nature of the LFC,
and on the other, by application of the LFC in an inconsistent manner, either to the string
and not to the rocket separation in S, or to the rocket separation, but not to the string,
in S’. There are no ‘stress eﬀects’ speciﬁc to SR and so the string does not break.

Similarly, all discussions of the Pole-and-Barn paradox (and several similar examples
cited above), in the literature and text books, have assumed that the LFC is a real,
not an apparent, eﬀect. There seems to be no justiﬁcation for such an assumption in
Einstein’s original work on SR. When the real positions of the moving objects (or rod) in
S are properly taken into account it is evident that they can never actually ﬁt into the
barn so that the situation depicted in Figs.1 and 2 of Reference [11] represents a physical
absurdity.

It is shown that both the LFC and SD eﬀects are direct consequences of the relativity
of simultaneity of SR ﬁrst proposed by Einstein. In the case of the LFC, what seems to
be a true paradox is revealed by this study. A photon, emitted by a moving object, is
predicted, by the LT, to be observed before the moving object has reached the position
at which it emits the photon. Essentially the same apparent breakdown of causality as
evidenced by ‘backwards running clocks’ has been pointed out in a recently published
paper [25].

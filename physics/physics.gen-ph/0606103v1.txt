Abstract

The Lorentz transformation is derived from the simplest thought experiment by using the simplest vector
formula from elementary geometry. The result is further used to obtain general velocity and acceleration
transformation equations.

Introduction

The light clock is a much used conceptual device to
demonstrate time dilation and length contraction in in-
troductory courses to special relativity (see e.g. [1]; [2]
gives an extensive bibliography) Less well known is the
fact that the Lorentz transformation can be entirely
derived once these eﬀects have been established. A pa-
per in which this was shown appeared in the American
Journal of Physics a long time ago [3]. However, the
author of [3] missed what we think is the easiest way
to derive the time transformation formula and was led
to obtain it through a rather contrived argument, in-
troducing an artiﬁcial extension of the ’time interval’.
Also, as in most papers on the subject, the derivation
was limited to transformations between two reference
frames in the so-called ’standard conﬁguration’ [4], viz.
parallel axes, OX ′ sliding along OX with co¨ıncident
space-time origins.

The purpose of the present paper is to show that the
full transformation can be derived from a purely geo-
metrical argument which amounts to writing the basic
vector addition formula in the two frames at stake suc-
cessively, taking into account the length contraction
eﬀect.
It is further shown that the same reasoning yields the
transformation for an arbitrary velocity between two
parallel frames with very little extra eﬀort. In passing,
a simple formula is derived for the space part of the
transformation.
To make this paper self-contained and also to prevent
objections which are often not taken care of in the
derivation of the two basic eﬀects using the light-clock,
we shall start with a brief review of this derivation in
section 2. To go straight to the heart of the argument,
we ﬁrst derive the Lorentz transformation from length
contraction between two frames in ’standard conﬁgu-
ration’ in section 3. Section 4 will then be devoted to
the more general case of an arbitrarily oriented rela-
tive velocity. Transposing the demonstration to this

more general case forces us to write the transforma-
tion in a slightly unusual form which yields the above
mentionned formula as a by-product. This allows us to
derive very simply general expressions for the velocity
and acceleration transformations in Section 5. Section
6 contains our summary and conclusions.

2 Time dilation and length con-

traction

2.1 The light clock

For those who do not know it, the light clock is a mes-
merizingly simple conceptual device to demonstrate
the basic eﬀects of special relativity starting from
Einstein’s two postulates. Admittedly, the second pos-
tulate viz. the constancy of the velocity of light in all
inertial frames can be dispensed with through general
considerations [5] if the existence of a limiting invariant
velocity is established. The only other choice would
be a possibly limitless relative velocity and galilean
invariance. However, Maxwell’s equations are there to
settle the matter.
We think nevertheless that for an introductory course,
the second postulate should be retained in as much
as it allows the students to arrive more quickly at the
heart of the matter without leaving the more practi-
cally minded ones stranded. They will have plenty of
time to assimilate and appreciate the value of general
symmetry arguments later in their cursus by getting
impregnated with them progressively.

2.1.1 Time dilation

We imagine the following device: a light signal bounces
back and forth between two parallel mirrors maintained
at a constant separation with the aid of pegs. The sig-
nal triggers the registering of a tick each time it hits
what we deﬁne as the ’lower’ mirror (ﬁg.1 a). The ques-
tion of how this device can be practically constructed

1

does not concern us. We simply assume that there is a
way to sample the signal in order to produce the tick
and to compensate for the loss of light incured thereof.
We thus have a kind of perfect clock the period of which
is T0 = 2L0
c with L0 the distance between the mirrors
and c the speed of light.
Let’s now look at the clock in a frame wherein it travels
at constant speed v in a direction parallel to the planes
of the mirrors. To prevent an objection, we might as-
sume that the mirrors are constrained to slide in two
parallel straight grooves which have been engraved a
constant distance l0 apart previous to the experiment,
so that there can’t be any arguing about a variation of
the mirror separation when they are moving.
By the ﬁrst postulate, this moving clock must have the
same period in its rest frame than its twin at rest in
the laboratory.
On the other hand, it is obvious that the length trav-
eled by the signal in the observer frame is longer than
the length in the clock rest frame (see ﬁg.1 b.) If T is
the interval between two ticks in the observer frame,
then by Einstein’s second postulate and Pythagora’s
theorem we have that (cT /2)2 = L2
0 + (vT /2)2 from
c )2 follows, which shows that the mov-
which T =

T0
√1−( v

ing clock runs more slowly in the lab frame.

2.1.2 Length contraction

We now imagine that the moving clock is traveling in
a direction perpendicular to the plane of its mirrors
relative to us. In this case, no check can be kept of the
inter-mirror distance. To make sure that (for the same
v) the clock period hasn’t changed, we can imagine an
observer traveling with the clock and provided with
an identical second clock oriented as before, parallel
to the velocity with respect to us. Since this second
clock has period T , as above, in our frame and since
the observer can reassure us that the two clocks tick
at the same rate in his frame, we can be sure that
the ﬁrst clock period as measured in our frame hasn’t
changed either. Anticipating the result which will be
forced upon us, we call l the inter-mirror distance as
measured in our frame. If we now consider the time
taken by the light signal to make its two-way travel
l
c+v for the lower
in our frame, we see that it needs
mirror-upper mirror part and l
c−v for the second part,
2lc
c2−v2 Since this must equal T one is
that is, a total of
( v
c )2
forced to conclude that l = l0p1

This ends our review of the basic light-clock ex-
periment. That the distances in the directions or-
thogonal to the motion are not changed can be

demonstrated by invoking grooves arguments like
the one we used for the time-dilation derivation.

3 Lorentz transformation along

the x axis

Let us now envision two frames in ’standard conﬁgu-
ration’ with K ′ having velocity v with respect to K
and let x, t (resp. x′, t′) be the coordinates of event M
in the two frames. Let O and O′ be the spatial ori-
gins of the frames; O and O′ co¨ıncide at time t = t′ = 0

Here comes the pretty argument: all we have to do
is to express the relation OM = OO′ + O′M between
vectors (which here reduce to oriented segments) in
both frames.
In K, OM = x, OO′ = vt and O′M seen from K is x
γ

with γ =

√1−( v
Hence the ﬁrst relation:

In K ′, OM = x
OO′ = vt′ and O′M = x′. Hence a second relation:

γ since x is OM as measured in K,

The ﬁrst relation yields immediately

which is the ’space’ part of the Lorentz transformation.
By using it to replace x′ in the second relation and with
some shuﬄing and simpliﬁcation by v, one easily gets
the second half of the transform

t′ = γ(t

vx/c2)

−
Needless to say, coordinates on the y and z axes are
unchanged for the already stated reason that distances
do not vary in the directions perpendicular to the ve-
locity. The contraction is therefore limited to that part
of the coordinate vector which is parallel to the relative
velocity.

In the following, v will denote the velocity vector of
K ′ w.r.t. K and r (resp. r′) the position vector of
the event under consideration as measured in frame K
(resp K ′). We further deﬁne u = v
|v| the unit vector
parallel to v.
From our ﬁndings of section 2, we see that only
the component of r parallel to v is aﬀected when
looking at it from the other frame, whilst the nor-
mal components are unchanged. We resolve r into
parallel and perpendicular components according to
r = uu.r + (1
u)r = rk + r⊥ where the dot
stands for the 3-space scalar product, 1 is the identity
operator and u
u is the dyadic which projects out
the component parallel to u from the vector it operates
upon, viz (u

whilst leaving the orthogonal components unchanged
must yield: u u.r

Let us therefore deﬁne Op(γ−1) = 1 + 1−γ

The inverse operator must correspond to multiplica-
tion of the longitudinal part by γ and is therefore
Op(γ) = Op(γ−1)−1 = 1 + (γ

checked by multiplication. Note that these operators
are even in u and therefore independent of the orien-
tation of v.

Mimicking what has been done in section 3, let us
now write OM = OO′ + O′M (these are vectors now,
no longer oriented segments) taking care of the invari-
ance of the orthogonal parts. We get in frame K:

and in frame K ′:

r = vt + Op(γ−1)r′

Op(γ−1)r = vt′ + r′

we ﬁnd:

The two formulas thus obtained for the L.T. are so
simple that they can readily be used to yield the veloc-
ity transformation equation without the need of com-
plicated thought experiments and algebraic manipula-
tions. Diﬀerentiating r′ and t′ w.r.t. t and taking the
quotient of the equalities thus obtained yields (with

By making the necessary substitutions: V

V and specializing to V parallel to Ox,
one can easily check that the components equations de-
rived from this general formula agree with those pub-
lished in [2]. They have been, however, derived with
much less eﬀort.
As an example of use, one sees that by specializing to
V = v and v.A = 0, one gets A′ = γ2A retrieving the
known result that a particle in a circular storage ring

undergoes a proper (A′) acceleration that is a factor
γ2 larger than the lab (A) acceleration. Moreover, the
two accelerations are parallel, which is far from obvi-
ous a priori. Observe in this respect, that all the terms
which can make A′ and A diﬀerent in direction as well
as in size vanish in the c
limit, consistent with the

fact that acceleration is an invariant quantity under a
change of inertial frame in newtonian physics.

one dimensional case to the 3-dimensional case is com-
pletely straightforward. The formula thus obtained al-
lows for a simple derivation of the velocity and acceler-
ation transformations without the need for complicated
thought experiments and algebraic manipulations be-
yond what college students are used to.

Abstract

Based on a Planck scale underpinning for the universe, we deduce
an expression for the gravitational constant which exhibits it as a
distributional eﬀect over all the particles of the universe. This solves
a long standing puzzle, the so called Weinberg formula which gives a
microphysical parameter in terms of a cosmic parameter. This was also
discussed on the basis of a cosmology that correctly predicted a dark
energy driven accelerating universe - the linkage is now established.

1 Introduction

More than ﬁve thousand years ago, the Rig Veda repeatedly raised the ques-
tion: “How is it that though unbound the sun does not fall down?”
This was a question that puzzled thinking man over the millennia. Indian
scholars right up to Bhaskaracharya who lived about a thousand years ago
believed in some attractive force which was responsible for keeping the celes-
tial bodies from falling down.
The same problem was addressed by Greek thinkers about two thousand ﬁve
hundred years ago. They devised transparent material spheres to which each
of the celestial objects were attached - the material spheres prevented them
from falling down.
Unfortunately it was this answer to the age old question, which held up fur-
ther scientiﬁc progress till the time of Kepler, for even Copernicus accepted
the transparent material spheres.
Kepler had a powerful tool in the form of the accurate observations of Tycho

1

Brahe. He also had the advantage of the Indian numeral system, which via
the Arabs reached Europe just a few centuries earlier. These lead him to his
famous laws of elliptical orbits with deﬁnite periods corelated to distances
from the Sun.
This couching of natural phenomena in the terse language of mathematical
symbols that could be manipulated, was the beginning of modern science.
The important point was that the Greek answer to the problem of why heav-
enly objects do not fall down - the transparent material spheres were now
demolished. The age old question of why celestial bodies do not fall down
come back to haunt again. Kepler himself speculated about some type of a
magnetic force between the Sun and the Planets, rather on the lines of earlier
speculations in India.
It was Newton who provided the breakthrough.
To qote Hawking [1],“The Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica by
Isaac Newton, ﬁrst published in Latin in 1687, is probably the most impor-
tant single work ever published in the physical sciences. Its signiﬁcance is
equalled in the biological sciences only by The Origin of Species. The origi-
nal impulse which caused Newton to write the Principia was a question from
Edmund Halley as to whether the elliptical orbits of the planets could be
accounted for on the hypothesis of an inverse square force directed towards
the Sun. This was something that Newton had worked out some years earlier
but had not published, like most of his work on mathematics and physics.
However, Halley’s challenge, and the desire to refute the suggestions of oth-
ers such as Hooke and Descartes, spurred Newton to try to write a proper
account of this result.”
Newton using Galileo’s ideas of Mechanics, thus stumbled upon the Universal
Law of Gravitation.
This held sway for nearly two hundred and twenty ﬁve years, before Ein-
stein came out with his own theory of gravitation. There was no force in
the mechanical sense that Newton and preceeding scholars had envisaged it
to be. Rather it was due to the curvature of spacetime itself. Einstein’s
bizarre ideas have had some experimental veriﬁcation while there are some
other experimental consequences, such as gravitational waves, which need to
be conﬁrmed.
After Einstein’s formulation of gravitation a problem that has challenged and
deﬁed solution has been that of providing a uniﬁed description of gravitation
along with other fundamental interactions. One of the earliest attempts was
that of Hermann Weyl, which though elegant was rejected on the grounds

2

that in the ﬁnal analysis, it was not really a uniﬁcation of gravitation with
electromagnetism but rather an adhoc prescription.
Modern approaches to this problem have ﬁnally lead to the abandonment of
a smooth spacetime manifold. Instead, the Planck scale is now taken to be
a minimum fundamental scale.
In earlier communications [2, 3] we had argued from diﬀerent points of view
to arrive at the otherwise empirically known equations

R = √N lP = √Nl

l = √nlP

(1)

(2)

where lP , l and R are the Planck length, the pion Compton wavelength and
the radius of the universe and N, ¯N and n are certain large numbers. Some of
these are well known empirically for example ¯N
1080 being the number of
elementary particles, which typically are taken to be pions in the literature,
in the universe.
One way of arriving at the above relations is by considering a series of N
Planck mass oscillators which are created out of the Quantum Vaccuum. In
this case (Cf. also ref.[4]) we have

∼

r = √Na2

In (2) a is the distance between the oscillators and r is the extent. Equations
(1) follow from equation (2).
There is another way of arriving at equations (1) (Cf.ref.[3]). For this, we
observe that the position operator for the Klein-Gordan equation is given by
[5],

~Xop = ~xop −

ı¯hc2
2

~p
E2

Whence we get

ˆX 2

op =

op ≡

2m3c4
¯h2 X 2

2m3c6
p2
¯h2 x2 +
2m
It can be seen that purely mathematically (3) for ˆX 2
op deﬁnes the Harmonic
oscillator equation, this time with quantized, what may be called space levels.
It turns out that these levels are all multiples of ( ¯h
mc )2. This Compton length
is the Planck length for a Planck mass particle. Accordingly we have for any
system of extension r,

(3)

r2

Nl2

∼

which gives back equation (1). It is also known that the Planck length is also
the Schwarzschild radius of a Planck mass, that is we have

lP = GmP /c2

(4)

Using equations (1) and (4), we will now deduce a few new and valid and
a number of otherwise empirically known relations involving the various mi-
crophysical parameters and large scale parameters. Some of these relations
are deducible from the others. Many of these relations featured (empirically)
in Dirac’s Large Number Cosmology. We follow Dirac and Melnikov in con-
sidering l, m, ¯h, lP , mP and e as microphysical parameters [6, 7]. Large scale
parameters include the radius and the mass of the universe, the number of
elementary particles in the universe and so on.
In the process we will also examine the nature of gravitation. It must also
be observed that the Large Number relations below are to be considered in
the Dirac sense, wherein for example the diﬀerence between the electron and
pion (or proton) masses is irrelevant [8].

2 Interrelationships

We will use the following well known equation which has been obtained
through several routes:

GM
c2 = R
For example in an uniformly expanding ﬂat Friedman spacetime, we have [8]

(5)

If we substitute ˙R = c at the radius of the universe in the above we recover
(5).
We now observe that from the ﬁrst two relations of (1), using the Compton
wavelength expression we get

Using also the second relation in (1) we can easily deduce

(6)

(7)

˙R2 =

8πGρR2
3

m = mP /√n

N = ¯N n

4

Using (1) and (5) we have

M = √NmP

Interestingly (8) can be obtained directly, without recourse to (5), from the
energy of the Planck oscillators (Cf.ref.[2]). Combining (8) and (6) we get

Further if we use in the last of equation (1) the fact that lP is the Schwarzchild
radius that is equation (4), we get,

We now observe that if we consider the gravitational energy of the N Planck
masses (which do not have any other interactions) we get,

Gravitational Energy =

GNm2
P
R

If this is equated to the inertial energy in the universe, Mc2, as can be easily
veriﬁed we get back (5). In other words the inertial energy content of the
universe equals the gravitational energy of all the N Planck oscillators.
Similarly if we equate the gravitational energy of the n Planck oscillators
constituting the pion we get

Using in (11) equation (4) we get

Whence it follows on using (7), (6) and (1),

n3/2 = √N , n = √ ¯N

Substituting the value for n from (12) into (10) we will get

If we use (12) in (9) we will get

M = ¯Nm

Alternatively we could use (14) which expresses the fact that the mass of the
universe is given by the mass of the ¯N elementary particles in it and deduce
equations (11), (12) and (13). Using the expressions for the Planck length
as a Compton wavelength and equating it to (4) we can easily deduce

e2 and (6). Equation (15) is another em-
wherein we have also used ¯hc
pirically well known equation which was used by Dirac in his Cosmology.
Interestingly, as we have deduced (15), rather than use it empirically, this
points to a uniﬁed description of electromagnetism and gravitation.
Interestingly also rewriting (13) as

(15)

(16)

Equation (16) is the so called mysterious Weinberg formula, known empir-
ically [8]. As Weinberg put it, “...it should be noted that the particular
combination of ¯h, H, G, and c appearing (in the formula) is very much closer
to a typical elementary particle mass than other random combinations of
these quantities; for instance, from ¯h, G, and c alone one can form a single
quantity (¯hc/G)1/2 with the dimensions of a mass, but this has the value
1022MeV /c2, more than a typical particle mass by about 20 orders of
1.22
×
magnitude!
“In considering the possible interpretations (of the formula), one should be
careful to distinguish it from other numerical “coincidences”... In contrast,
(the formula) relates a single cosmological parameter, H, to the fundamental
constants ¯h, G, c and m, and is so far unexplained.”
We will come back to this point but remark that (13) brings out gravitation

6

in a diﬀerent light– somewhat on the lines of Sakharov. In fact it shows up
gravitation as the excess or residual energy in the universe.
Finally it may be observed that (13) can also be rewritten as

(17)

and so also (10) can be rewritten as

Looking at it this way, given G and the microphysical parameters we can

3 Comments

Thus the many so called large number coincidences and the mysterious Wein-
berg formula can be deduced on the basis of a Planck scale underpinning for
the elementary particles and the whole universe. This was done from a com-
pletely diﬀerent point of view, namely using fuzzy spacetime and ﬂuctuations
in a 1997 model that successfully predicted a dark energy driven accelerating
universe with a small cosmological constant [3, 9].
However the above treatment brings out the role of the Planck scale particles
in the Quantum Vaccuum. It resembles, as remarked earlier the Sakharov-
Zeldovich metric elasticity of space approach [10]. Essentially Sakharov ar-
gues that the renormalization process in Quantum Field Theory which re-
moves the Zero Point energies is altered in General Relativity due to the
curvature of spacetime, that is the renormalization or subtraction no longer
gives zero but rather there is a residual energy similar to the modiﬁcation
in the molecular bonding energy due to deformation of the solids. We see
this in a little more detail following Wheeler [11]. The contribution to the
Lagrangian of the Zero Point energies can be given in a power series as follows

L(r) = A¯h

k3dk + B¯h(4)r

kdk

terms).

where A, B, C etc. are of the order of unity and r denotes the curvature. By
renormalization the ﬁrst term in (18) is eliminated. According to Sakharov,
the second term is the action principle term, with the exception of some mul-
tiplicated factors. (The higher terms in (18) lead to corrections in Einstein’s
equations). Finally Sakharov gets

G =

c3
16πB¯h

kdk

Sakharov then takes a Planck scale cut oﬀ for the divergent integral in the
denominator of (19). This immediately yields

Infact using relations like (1), (6) and (12), it is easy to verify that (20) gives
us back (10) (and (13)).
According to Sakharov (and (20)), the value of G is governed by the Physics
of Fields and Particles and is a measure of the metrical elasticity at small
spacetime intervals. It is a microphysical constant.
However in our interpretation of (13) (which is apparently the same as
Sakharov’s equation (20)), G appears as the expression of a residual en-
ergy over the entire universe: The entire universe has an underpinning of the
N Planck oscillators and is made up of ¯N elementary particles, which again
each have an underpinning of n Planck oscillators.
It must be reiterated
that (20) obtained from Sakharov’s analysis shows up G as a microphysical
parameter because it is expressed in their terms. This is also the case in
Dirac’s cosmology. This is also true of (10) because n relates to the micro
particles exclusively.
However when we use the relation (12), which gives n in terms of ¯N , that
is links up the microphysical domain to the large scale domain, then we get
(13). With Sakharov’s equation (20), the mysterious nature of the Weinberg
formula remains. But once we use (13), we are eﬀectively using the large
scale character of G – it is not a microphysical parameter. This is brought
out by (17), which is another form of (13). If G were a microphysical param-
eter, then the number of elementary particles in the universe would depend

8

solely on the microphysical parameters and would not be a large scale param-
eter. The important point is that G relates to elementary particles and the
whole universe [12]. That is why (13) or equivalently the Weinberg formula
(16) relate supposedly microphysical parameters to a cosmological param-
eter. Once the character of G as brought out by (13) is recognized, the
mystery disappears.

4 Fluctuations I

In 1997 a model [3] correctly predicted a dark energy driven accelerating
universe with a small cosmological constant at a time when the belief was
that, aided by dark matter, the universe was slowing down. This contra
view was conﬁrmed by observational evidence in 1998 and thereafter. This
model also deduced from theory some well known empirical relations between
cosmological parameters and constants from micro physics, relations which
had puzzled astronomers for nearly a century.
Cosmic parameters include the radius of the universe R and the Hubble
constant H and microphysical parameters include ¯h, c and l and m (the
Compton wavelength and mass of a typical elementary particle, taken in the
literature to be a pion) and e. They have been considered to be puzzling
coincidences. For example we have,

universe. Equation (21) is the well known Weyl-Eddington formula. On the
other hand (22) which is the ratio of the electromagnetic and Gravitational
coupling constants, is deducible from (23). The very mysterious feature of
(23) has been stressed by Weinberg as we saw earlier.

We will now take a diﬀerent route and provide a theoretical rational for
equations (21), (22) and (23), and in the process light will be shed on the
new cosmological model and the nature of gravitation as we saw earlier.

5 Large Number Relations

Following Sivaram [13] we consider the gravitational self energy of the pion.
This is given by

With this value of b (25) gives back (23).

There are several derivations of (28). For example in a uniformly expanding
Friedman universe (Cf.ref.[8]), we have

If we substitute the value ˙R = c at the radius of the universe, then we recover
(28). If we use (28) in (27) we will get

Let M/m = N be called the number of elementary particles in the universe.
Then (29) can be written as

We observe that (30) can also be written as

Using (30) in (28) it is easy to verify that we get

We now observe that (32) is the same as (21) while (31) is the same as (2),
1080, the well known number of elementary particles in

the universe. Moreover (30) becomes, on using (32) and the fact that H = c

the mysterious Weinberg formula (23).

Equation (34) is the starting point of the ﬂuctuational cosmology referred
to (Cf.ref.[3]). To put it brieﬂy in a phase transition from the Quantum
Vaccuum √N particles appear within the Compton time τ . Starting from
(34) it is possible to deduce the various relations (1) to (23) and (26), (30)
and (33). It was shown that this leads to an ever expanding universe with a
Hubble constant given by,

6 Remarks

We now make a few remarks. Firstly it is interesting to note that √Nm
will be the mass added to the universe. Let us now apply the well known
Beckenstein formula for the life time of a mass M viz., [16],

to the above mass. The life time as can be easily veriﬁed turns out to be
exactly the age of the universe!
The second remark is that (30) shows that G has a distributional character
over all the N particles in the universe, that is it is not a microphysical pa-
rameter [12]. This now explains the mystery of the Weinberg formula (23)

G2M 3/¯hc4

t

≈

12

- the presence of G along with H shows that there are two large scale pa-
rameters in (23).
In other words (23) does not give a single cosmological
parameter in terms of purely microphysical parameters.
We next observe that with the dependence on time of G, given by, for exam-
ple (26), it is possible to recover standard eﬀects like the precession of the
perihelion of Mercury or the bending of light [9, 17].
A Final remark. To appreciate the role of ﬂuctuations in the otherwise mys-
terious Large Number relations, let us follow Hayakawa [18] and consider
√N of the elementary
the excess of electric energy due to the ﬂuctuation
particles in the universe and equate it to the inertial energy of an elementary
particle. We get

This gives us back (22) if we use (28). If we use (21) on the other hand, we
get

7 Fluctuations II

We start with the current view of Planck scale oscillators in the background
dark energy or Quantum Vaccuum. In this context it has been shown that
1040
elementary particles can be considered to be normal modes of n
Planck oscillators in the ground state, while the etire universe itself has an
10120 such oscillators, there being ¯N
1080 elementary
underpinning of N
particles in the universe [2]. These Planck oscillators are formed out of the
Quantum Vaccuum (or dark energy). Thus we have, mP c2 being the energy
of each Planck oscillator, mP being the Planck mass,

the literature. In the sequel we will denote the mass, Compton length and
Compton time of an elementary particle like the pion by m, l and τ while the
same symbols with subscript P denote the Planck mass and Planck scale.
Similarly the ground state of N such Planck oscillators would be

Due to the ﬂuctuation

using (35), and so the indeterminacy time is

∆E

√nmc2 = mP c2,

¯h
mP c2 = τP ,

as indeed we would expect.
The corresponding minimum indeterminacy length would therefore be lP .
One of the consequences of the minimum spacetime cut oﬀ is that the Heisen-
berg Uncertainty Principle takes an extra term [19]. Thus we have

ﬂuctuation in energy ∆ ¯E = √ ¯Nmc2 in the ¯N particle states of the universe

time is τ . It must be emphasized that the Compton time τ of an elementary
particle, is an interval within which there are unphysical eﬀects like zitterbe-
wegung - as pointed out by Dirac, it is only on averaging over this interval,
that we return to meaningful Physics. This gives us,

d ¯N/dt = √ ¯N /τ

(38)

14

On the other hand due to the ﬂuctuation in the √N oscillators constituting
the universe, the ﬂuctuational energy is similarly given by

√N ¯mc2,

which is the same as (36) above. Another way of deriving (38) is to observe
that as √n particles appear ﬂuctuationally in time τP which is, in the ele-
mentary particle time scales, √n√n = √ ¯N particles in √nτP = τ . That is,
the rate of the ﬂuctuational appearance of particles is

√n
τP !

 

=

√ ¯N
τ

= d ¯N/dt

which is (38).
Equation (38) was used in the model of ﬂuctuational cosmology which cor-
rectly predicted in advance a dark energy driven accelerating universe with
a small cosmological constant, and also deduced from theory the supposedly
mysterious and inexplicable large number relations including the hitherto
puzzling and inexplicable Weinberg formula to be seen below [9, 8, 3]. Thus
it is possible to understand the ﬂuctuations in terms of the underpinning of
Planck scale oscillators in the Quantum Vaccuum.
We would now like to make some remarks. Starting from a completely dif-
ferent point of view namely Black Hole Thermodynamics, Landsberg [14]
10−65gms,
deduced that the smallest observable mass in the universe is
which is exactly the minimum mass given in (36).
Further due to the ﬂuctuational appearance of √ ¯N particles, the ﬂuctua-
tional mass associated with each of the ¯N particles in the universe is

∼

√ ¯Nm
¯N

=

10−65gms,

m
√ ¯N ∼
that is once again the smallest observable mass or ground state mass in the
universe.
We next remark that it was argued using the geometrical model of Santamoto
that cosmic ﬂuctuations could yield the Bohmian Quantum Mechanics [20,
21, 22, 23]. Indeed another way of seeing this is as follows: The ﬂuctuation in
the gravitational energy of a typical elementary particle is given by, following
Hayakawa [18, 24],

(∆mc2) =

G√ ¯Nm2
R

=

G√ ¯Nm2
c

1
T

,

·

15

or, we have,

(∆mc2)T =

G√ ¯Nm2
c

(= ¯h)

Interestingly, as can be veriﬁed the right side of (4) is the reduced Planck
constant, while (39) itself is an expression of the Uncertainty Principle.
Equally we could argue that in the random motion of ¯N particles, l the
ﬂuctuation in the length is given by

l

≈

R
√ ¯N

Specializing to the case of the universe where l is the Compton length and R
is the radius of the universe, (40) is the well known Weyl-Eddington formula,
one of the mysterious large number relations. Incidentally while Sivaram has
argued that l plays the role of a fundamental length in strong and electro-
magnetic interactions, the existence of such a fundamental length leads to,
in modern approaches a non commutative geometry with interesting conse-
quences [9, 19, 13].
We will now relate the second term in (37) with l in place of lP , to large
1080 is the number of
scale ﬂuctuations
elementary particles encountered earlier. Infact the second term gives with
∆x = R the radius of the universe,

and where the total uncertainty in momentum is √ ¯Nmc. Whence we have

Interestingly (41) which is the same as (30) is equivalent to (39) the right
side of which is ¯h as remarked. Even more interestingly (41) is identical to
the mysterious Weinberg formula

Equation (42) as we saw, has been a big puzzle because it relates a cosmo-
logical parameter H with what have been considered to be microphysical
constants.
However it can be seen that there is an explanation in large scale ﬂuctua-
tions and the related fuzzyness in spacetime leading to (41) which is another
form of (42) (Cf. also [12]). The point is, that (41) shows the distributional
character of G over all the ¯N particles of the universe, rather than as a mi-
crophysical constant. Thus the Weinberg formula is no longer mysterious,
and moreover it is not accidental, but has been derived. Equally interesting
is the fact that (39) or (41) or (42) give back

e2/Gm2

(43)

which as we saw is another well known supposedly accidental relationship ex-
pressing the relative strengths of the electromagnetic and gravitation strengths.
It must be mentioned that all these “Large Number Relations” have been
deduced alternatively on the basis of the ﬂuctuational cosmology referred to
earlier, whilch uses equation (38).
So we can see the convergence of considerations from this approach and the
apparently diﬀerent approach of fuzzy spacetime and the Modiﬁed Uncer-
tainty Principle.

8 Characterizing the Weak Interaction

In earlier work, we had given a characterization of the weak interaction [9].
We will now examine this issue afresh. As noted, the balance of the grav-
itational force and the fermi energy of the cold background nutrinos gives

then use the fact that due to the ﬂuctuation in the number of nutrinos, we
have

where ¯g2 gives the weak interaction coupling constant. Comparing this with
a similar equation for the electron we get [9]

as indeed is known to be the case. To proceed further if as in earlier work,
we equate the gravitational energy of the neutrino vis-a-vis other neutrinos
with its inertial energy we get

which infact was conﬁrmed by the Superkamiokande experiments. Thus it is
possible to characterize the weak interactions in terms of ﬂuctuations.
Interestingly l the pion Compton wavelength turns out to be a fundamental
length, as in the Heisenberg uniﬁed theory. Infact we have for the strong
interaction

For the gravitational interaction, the coupling constant is given by g2

mG ∼

10−65gms. Whence we have

We ﬁnally observe that if at all there is a smallest scale in the universe, then
this scale is not smaller than the Planck scale. This is because, when the
smallest scale is a, we have the relation

which leads to the Modiﬁed Uncertainty Principle

Using in the second term of the Modiﬁed Uncertainty Principle the fact that

which shows that the Planck length is the minimum possible length in the
universe, as is to be otherwise expected.
This also means that a Black Hole cannot have a mass less than the Planck
mass 10−5gms. This is surprising, because in the usual theory of Black Holes,
any arbitrary mass can be a Black Hole with a suitably deﬁned Schwarzchild
radius.

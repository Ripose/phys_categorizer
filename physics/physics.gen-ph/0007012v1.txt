Abstract

In the paper physics/0007003 it was shown that after a correct deﬁnition of the relations between
observables in general relativity a horizon and a singularity disappear. The general relativity in physical
variables really predicts an existence of supercompact relativistic stars and relativistic galactic nuclei
with (light and heavy) barionic and quark contents instead of unphysical black holes. They have the
radii near the gravitational radii and emit the spectral lines with high redshifts and the energetic (X- and
gamma) photons. The quasars can be naturally interpreted as such relativistic supercompact objects and
their high redshifts explained mainly as a gravitational redshift. The existing of the second mechanism
of redshift in addition to the Doppler shift leads to a normalization of all parameters of quasars as the
compact galactic nuclei. In principle new consequence of general relativity is a prediction that some of
quasars may be the relativistic stars in the Galaxy. A short time variability of such quasars then can be
naturally explained.

2 PARTICLE KINEMATICS IN TERM OF PHYSICAL VARIABLES

1

Introduction

The black holes, predicted by a standard treatment
of general relativity, up to now not convincingly re-
vealed, but at the same time more than 13200 quasars
are discovered with very high red shifts (z < 5.8)
which can not be explained in the standard theory
without assumptions about fantastic masses, lumi-
nosities and fantastically small sizes and large dis-
tances.

In [4] I proposed a new description of the par-
ticle’s motion in the Schwarzschild ﬁeld in term of
the physical observables of general relativity. In this
new picture the falling is fully reversible in time and
the horizons and singularities disappear. It is shown
that the correctly interpreted general relativity not
predicts a collapse and black holes, but it naturally
explains the quasars with the arbitrary high redshifts
as relativistic stars or galactic nuclei with ordinary
masses, luminosities, sizes and distances.

In the ﬁrst part of the present paper I shortly
describe the new interpretation of quasars and in the
second part a coincidence with the astrophysics of
quasars will be discussed. More detail considerations
and discussions will be presented in [3] and in the
forthcoming publications.

2 Particle kinematics in term of

physical variables

Let we observe on L-frame the freely falling from in-
ﬁnity sample particle. We can obtain an equation of
motion for this particle as the local (physical) time τ
dependence of the radial coordinate R by using the
relation:

(

dr
cdτ

)2 =

v2
c2 =

rg
R

which leads from an energy conservation condition

in the static ﬁeld [2][1]. We have:

± cdτ = drs R

rg

= dRγ−1/2s R

rg

or:

± c(τ − τ0) =

1
r1/2
g

After the integration we obtain:

cτ = ±

2(R + 2rg)

3r1/2

g

Z

RdR

pR − rg
pR − rg

where we take τ0 = 0 at R = rg which means that
τ = 0 at R = rg and then a worldline of particle is
symmetric under this moment. It is surprising, that a

minimal distance, which can be reached by the falling
particle is R = rg and then it elastically reﬂects from
the source.

A geometric reason for such behavior of R can be
understanded after an obtaining direct relationship
between I-frame radial coordinate R and the physical
radial distance in the gravitational ﬁeld r(R) on L-
frame as:

= Rr1 −

rg
R

+ rgF (R)

(5)

r(R) =Z

where

)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

with property F (rg) = 0. The lower limit of inte-
gration here may be only R0 = rg, where the physi-
cal radius vanishes: r(R) = 0. This means that zero
point of the physical radius r = 0 where the source lo-
cated from the point of view of L-frame observer, cor-
responds to the value of the radial coordinate R0 = rg
of I-frame observer. Therefore, the result of the local
gravitational extension of radial distances between or-
bits in the curved spacetime is the global topological
diﬀerence between L- and I-frame coordinate systems
when to the values of physical radius r in the interval
(0, ∞) correspond the values of radial coordinate R
in the interval (rg, ∞) and for their coincidence the
interior region of gravitational radius R < rg must
be excluded as unphysical part of I-frame coordinate
system.

We see that in our new picture the particle can not
”penetrate’ to an interior of region R < rg, a horizon
and singularities are disappear, the world line of par-
ticle is continuous, the frame is complete (not con-
tains unobservable regions) and the process is fully
reversible in time. If local inertial observers in each
orbit register the falling particle and after some time
register a returning of this particle, these events are
absolute physical facts and the such character of the
world line is invariant under transformations of the
local inertial frames.

We can consider this process from a point of view
of the F-frame observer, where the space-time inter-
val (proper time) of falling particle is:

c2dT 2 = (

c2dτ 2
dr2 − 1)dr2 =

R
rg

dR2

(7)

If we directly integrate with lower limit R0 = 0
then we obtain the well known Lemaitre’s result (see
[2][1]) which is the basic formula for modern stan-
dard treatments of the Schwarzschild problem with
horizon, collapse and singularity.

3 THEORY OF RELATIVISTIC STARS

But we also know that on the I-frame radial coor-
dinate R contains a ”physical” or ”dynamic” part Rg,
coinciding with the physical radius r and the unphys-
ical part rg and it can be represented as R = Rg + rg,
where Rg = 0 at R = rg. Therefore, we have:

± cτ = Rr1 −

rg
R

+ rgF (R)

(15)

and in term of I-frame time:

(8)

± c(t − t0) = R − rg + rg ln |

R − rg

a

|

(16)

Here we take τ = t = 0 at R = rg. When the
times τ and t are change at intervals (−∞, 0) and
(0, ∞), R changes at interval (rg, ∞). The trajectory
of photon also is time symmetric and it elastically
reﬂects from the source at R = rg.

Thus, we can conclude, that:
1) World lines of particles and photons are con-
tinuous and timelike, at all values of T, τ and t in
the interval (−∞, ∞) the radial coordinate R changes
in the interval (rg, ∞). Therefore, Schwarzschild’s
frame and coordinates are complete;

2) The falling particles and photons elastically re-
ﬂect at R = rg, the processes are fully reversible in
time and all times are ﬁnite (for ﬁnite distances and
ﬁnite size sources);

3) The horizon, singularity and collapse are not
appear in general relativity if we deﬁne the space-
time variables adequately to the true geometry of the
curved spacetime.

3 Theory of relativistic stars

Let we consider Tolman’s solution of Einstein equa-
tions in the case of spherically symmetric dust matter
(see [2]). The line element can be chosen as:

(12)

c(T − T0) = ±

1
r1/2
g

Z pRg + rgdRg

and:

c(T − T0) = ±

2

3r1/2

g

(R3/2 − r3/2

g

)

(9)

This formula diﬀers from the standard black (white)

hole picture because of here the falling particle elasti-
cally reﬂects from the gravitational radius R = rg at
T = T0 and it can not ”penetrating” into the region
R < rg.

From the previous energy conservation condition
an equation of motion for the falling particle in term
of the local Schwarzschild observer’s time t can be
obtained as:

± cdt =

(10)

dR
(1 − rg

R )q rg

R

and after the integration we have:

R
β1/2 [

± c(t − t0) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where β = rg/R and:

+ 4β + β3/2K(R)](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
1 + β1/2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1 − β1/2

K(R) = ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

This time interval is divergent if the lower limit
Ra = rg, but this divergence is the result of the point-
ness of source. The real source has a ﬁnite size a and
the lower value of physical radius is not zero but is
r = a. In term of radial coordinate this means that
Ra = a + rg is the minimal value of radial coordinate
R which deﬁne the value of t0. Then we obtain the
ﬁnite time interval for the falling and the reﬂecting
of particle in coordinates of the observer at inﬁnity.
The space-time interval for a radially falling pho-

ton on L- frame is:

ds2 = c2dτ 2 − eλ(τ,Ra)dR2

a − R2(τ, Ra)dΩ2

(17)

with a solution:

eλ(τ,Ra) = (

∂R
∂Ra

)2[1 + f (Ra)]−1

(18)

Here Ra is a radial coordinate of dust matter par-
ticle and τ is its proper time. Then an equation of
motion can be obtained as:

(

∂R
c∂τ

)2 = f (Ra) +

F (Ra)

R

(19)

(20)

ds2 = γc2dt − γ−1dR2 = 0

(13)

which has a solution:

Therefore, a local time dependence of R along the

world line of photon on L-frame (light cone) is:

cτ = ±r

(14)

or

± c[τ0(Ra) − τ ] =Z

dR
(f + F
R )1/2

Here the three types of solutions can be obtained
at f > 0, f < 0 and f = 0. In the standard treat-
ments a scenario of collapse is qualitatively the same
for the every cases [2]. We take the simplest case

4 QUASARS AS RELATIVISTIC STARS AND GALACTIC NUCLEI

f = 0 since in other cases the pictures are qualita-
tively the same as in this case.

The time dependence of the radial coordinate then

directly can be obtained as:

a − R3/2]

(21)

The radial distances on F-and I-frames have iden-
tical scale units and here R and Ra are identical with
I-frame radial coordinate, which contains the physical
part (Rph) and the unphysical constant part (rg(e))
in the form R = Rph + rg(e). Here rg(e) > 0 is an
eﬀective gravitational radius which can be calculated
taking into account a radial coordinate dependence of
F (Ra) and using the fact that every layer with deﬁ-
nite Ra falls to a center of gravity due to a gravitating
of the Schwarzschild ﬁeld of the mass inside the radius
Ra. Then we come to the analogous conclusions as in
the case of falling sample particle in external static
ﬁeld. Particularly, a free falling layer of dust mat-
ter with radial coordinate Ra after the time τ = τ0
reaches the center of gravity with Rph = 0, which
for the observer at inﬁnity located on the eﬀective
gravitational radius R = rg(e), the layer reﬂects at
this value of R = rg(e) and then it move away. The
horizon and collapse disappear, spacetime intervals
for physical objects are timelike (or lightlike).

A volume of sphere around the source is:

V = 4πZ R2γ−1/2dR = 4πZ R2γ−1/2dRg

(22)

This integral easily can be calculated and we ob-

tain:

We see, that V (rg) = 0 and the region R < rg
is excluded from the space volume of general relativ-
ity since the lower limit of integration is R = rg (or
Rg = 0). This fact and the results of preceding con-
siderations lead to a new picture of stellar evolution
including new families of compact relativistic stars
with sizes near their gravitational radii. Relativistic
stars we will classify by two natural parameters - rg
which ﬁx a mass (M ) and β = rg/R which ﬁx a red-
shift (z).
In term of these natural parameters the
volume of star is:

A density of star with mass M in a case of homo-

geneous matter is:

ρ = M · V −1(R)

(28)

Supercompact stars with R ∼ rg, have a ﬁnite
volume and a ﬁnite density. Hence, the hierarchy of
supercompact stars with ordinary and extraordinary
physical matter not stop on the neutron star’s level,
but it continued to more dense physical states. For
the stars with masses more than the critical mass of
neutron star’s stability M > (3 ÷ 5)M⊙ the family
of stable states can appears. The ﬁrst is the family
of heavy baryon stars, containing baryonic resonances
(Λ, Σ, Ξ, ∆). The multiquark hadron stars and quark
stars, which appear after quark-hadron phase transi-
tion also can be considered. Some of the observing
candidates to black holes can be one of above men-
tioned type stars.

The searches of the supermassive stars containing
subquarks or other types of substituents of quarks
and leptons (subquark stars), heavy particles of the
grand uniﬁcation also become a correct search pro-
grams without any gravitational restrictions.

In the next section a theory of quasars as the rela-
tivistic stars or relativistic galactic nuclei will be pre-
sented as the direct consequence of general relativity
without any additional hypotheses.

4 Quasars as relativistic stars and

galactic nuclei

Quasi Stellar Objects (quasars) in astrophysics de-
ﬁned as the point sources of emission with high values
of redshift of their spectral lines. The last catalogs in-
clude more than 13200 quasars with z < 5.8.

Since a stellar redshift in black hole treatments of
general relativity was restricted at z < 0.2 with the
maximal value for the neutron stars, a standard in-
terpretation of quasar’s high redshift mechanism was
only the cosmological Doppler redshift.
In this in-
terpretation the luminosities of quasars, which sizes
are very small with respect to galaxies (< 1ps), nev-
ertheless 103 ÷ 104 times exceed the luminosities of
galaxies. The distances then must be (0.1 ÷ 5)·109ps.
Many of quasars have broad emission lines and some
of them have also absorbtion lines with suﬃciently

5 CONCLUSION

less values of redshifts than emission lines of the same
quasar. At such fantastic parameters some of quasars
are variable and their luminosities changed 2÷3 times
during of few days, weeks or years which probably
leads to the contradictions with causality.

In our treatment of relativistic stars all restric-
tions to superdense states and to redshifts disappear.
We can demonstrate this new situation how the red-
shift restriction of previous treatments disappears in
our case.

In an inequality (see §11.6 [1]):

pg00(0) ≤ γ1/2(R0) −

rg
2R3

[1 − 2GMR′2

after the calculation of the integral with limits
(R0, rg(e)), where rg(e) is some ”eﬀective ” gravita-
tional radius inside of the star, we have:

γ1/2(R0) −

(30)

pg00(0) ≤

If rg(e) = 0 we obtain 8−9β ≥ 0 due to a property

pg00(0) > 0 and the inequality β = rg/R0 < 8/9

and then we come to the standard redshift restriction
z < 2.

But since in our treatment 0 < rg(e) ≤ rg, then in

fact we have:

8 − 9β + η2β3 ≥ 0

(31)

where η = rg(e)/rg > 0 and 0 < β ≤ 1 for the
ﬁnite mass sources. This inequality is obeyed at any
value of η > 0 and therefore, in general relativity in
fact not exist any restriction for the values of z.

Two statements of new theory of relativistic stars,
the ﬁrst that the superdense matter not collapsed but
formed new types of stars and galactic nuclei and, the
second that no restrictions for stellar and extragalac-
tic objects redshifts, lead to the new general relativis-
tic theory of quasars as the relativistic galactic nuclei
and (probably) as relativistic stars in the Milky Way.
The main mechanism of high redshift of quasars
from the point of view of general relativity is the grav-
itational redshift since they are supercompact objects
with sizes near their gravitational radii and they have
β = 1 − ε, where ε ≪ 1. In the case of galactic nuclei
the cosmological Doppler redshift must be separated
from the full redshift by some astrophysical methods
and then the gravitational part of redshift can be de-
termined, or conversely, if we can estimate indepen-
dently the gravitational redshift then we can more ex-
actly deﬁne the Doppler part and then can determine
the true distances. But in both cases the distances,

luminosities and masses of extragalactic quasars be-
come 104 − 105 times less than modern standard es-
timations and they become normal with respect to the
analogous parameters of galactic nuclei. This fact
show the ﬁrst normalization role of our treatment for
the astrophysics of quasars.

The redshift diﬀerences between absorbtion and
emission lines easily explained by an existence of ab-
sorbing layers at surface of relativistic objects since
small diﬀerence of radii (few percent from rg) be-
tween layers leads to large redshift diﬀerences (∆z ∼
0.1 ÷ 1.0).

Up to now quasars considered only as extragalac-
tic large distance and very massive (109 ÷ 1012M⊙)
objects since only the Doppler shift explanation of
their redshift. If we treat the redshift mainly as the
gravitational one, then it will be not wonderful from
the point of view of general relativity if in the case of
some quasars the full observed redshift may be only
gravitational redshift. Such quasars may be in the lo-
cal group of galaxies and here we can obtain a useful
information about the dynamics and the structure of
quasars, and obviously, about the galaxies evolution.
New in principle prediction of the present version
of general relativity consists in the possibility of the
ﬁnding of quasars in the Milky Way as the relativis-
tic stars with high redshifts but with the ordinary stel-
lar masses, luminosities and distances. The particle
content of such small quasars is not suﬃcient for our
purposes in this paper since the same value of redshift
may be in the case of various relativistic stars with
diﬀerent particles (neutrons, hyperons, quarks) and
masses (5 ÷ 100 M⊙). The searches of such quasars
in the Galaxy or identiﬁcation of some known quasars
(in equatorial zone of the Galaxy) as relativistic stars
will be very important for veriﬁcation of the present
treatment of general relativity.

5 Conclusion

The Schwarzschild’s world in physical variables be-
comes simple and normal from a point of view of tra-
ditional physics. Falling matter normally scatters on
the source and accretion. The interior of the horizon,
collapse, irreversibility and singularity are disappear,
an evaporation make no sense [3]. Only methods and
results retain their validity in general relativity which
work with an exterior region of the gravitational ra-
dius (for example, an accretion) and not use unphys-
ical variables of the interior region.

The general relativity in combination with parti-
cle physics predicts new families of relativistic stars
and galactic nuclei which we observe as quasars, AGN
or others, instead of black holes.

The details of the new theory of quasars and the

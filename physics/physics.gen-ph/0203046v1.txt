In the φ-mapping theory, the topological current constructed by the

order parameters can possess diﬀerent inner structure. The diﬀerence

in topology must correspond to the diﬀerence in physical structure.

The transition between diﬀerent structures happens at the bifurcation

point of the topological current. In a self-interaction two-level system,

the change of topological particles corresponds to change of energy

levels.

In recent years, topology has established itself as an important part of the physi-

cist’s mathematical arsenal [1]. The concepts of the topological particle and its

current have been widely used in particle physics [2,3] and topological defect the-

ory [4]. Here, the topological particles are regarded as abstract particles, such as

monopoles and the points defects.

In this paper, we give a new understanding in topology and physics. Many

physics system can be described by employing the order parameters. By making use

of the φ-mapping theory, we ﬁnd that the topological current constructed by the

order parameters can possess diﬀerent inner structure. The topological properties

are basic properties for a physics system, so the diﬀerence in conﬁguration of the

topological current must correspond to the diﬀerence in physical structure.

Considering a (n+1)-dimensional system with n-component vector order param-

eter ﬁeld ~φ(x), where x = (x0, x1, x2,

xn) correspond to local coordinates. The

in which zi(x0) are the zero lines where ~φ(x) = 0, the positive integer βi and ηi =

sgnD( φ

~x ) are the Hopf index and Brouwer degree of φ-mapping [7] respectively, and

l is the total number of the zero lines. This current is similar to a current of point

particles and the i-th one with the charge βiηi, and the zero lines zi(x) are just

the trajectories of the particles, for convenience we deﬁne these point particles as

topological particles. Then the total topological charge of the system is

here M is a n-dimensional spatial space for a given x0. This is a topological invariant

and corresponds to some basic conditions of this physical system. However, it is

important that the inner structure of the topological invariant can be constructed

in diﬀerent conﬁgurations, i.e., the number of the topological particles and their

charge can be changed. This change in conﬁguration of the topological current

must correspond to some change in physical structure.

All of the above discussion is based on the condition that

it is shown that there exist several crucial cases of branch process, which correspond

(cid:16)

zi

(cid:12)

to the topological particle generating or annihilating at limit points and splitting,

encountering or merging at the bifurcation points. A vast amount of literature has

been devoted to discussing these features of the evolution of the topological particles

[8]. Here, we will not spend more attention on describing these evolution, but put

our attention on the physical substance of these processes.

As we have known before, all of these branch processes keep the total topological

charge conserved, but it is very important that these branch processes change the

number and the charge of the topological particles.

i.e. change the inner struc-

ture of the topological current. In our point of view, the diﬀerent conﬁguration of

topological current corresponds to the diﬀerent physical structure.

We consider x0 as a parameter λ of a physics system. Let us deﬁne

fi(λ) = D0

 

φ

(cid:12)

(6)

As λ changing, the value of fi(λ) changes along the zero lines zi(λ). At a critical

point λ = λc, when fi(λc) = 0, we know that the inner structure of the topological

current will be changed in some way, at the same time the physical structure will

also be changed, i.e., the physical structure when λ < λc will be diﬀerent from the

one when λ > λc. The transition between these structures occurs at the bifurcation

points where fi(λ) = 0.

of ~n is a general function), and the vector ~φ is continuous and diﬀerentiable at the

neighborhoods of its zero points. Then from φ-mapping theory, we can obtain a

From Eqs.

(12) and (13), it is easy to see that ~φ is single-valued on S2, which

states that Hopf index βi = 1 (i = 1, 2,

, l) here.

It can be proved that the

total charge of this system is just the Euler number of S2 which is 2 [6]. This is a

topological invariant of S2 which corresponds to the basic condition of this system:

2 +

2 = 1. The following discussion can show that this topological invariant

|
can possess diﬀerent conﬁguration when γ changes. This diﬀerence in topology

|

corresponds to the change in adiabatic levels of this nonlinear system.

We can prove that every topological particle corresponds to an eigenstate of the

nonlinear two-level system. By solving ~φ = 0 form (12) and (13), we ﬁnd there are

two diﬀerent cases for discussing.

Case 1. For

C/V

1, there only two topological particles P1 and P2, which

|

| ≤

locate on the line ϕ = 0 and ϕ = π respectively as shown in the upper panel

of Fig.1. All of them with topological charge +1, and D(γ)

|P1,2 > 0 for any γ.
Correspondingly, in this case, there are only two adiabatic energy levels in this

nonlinear two-level mode for various γ [9], as shown in the lower panel of Fig.1, P1

corresponds to the upper level and P2 corresponds to the lower level.

Case 2, For C/V > 1, two more topological particles can appear when γ lies in a

window

γc < γ < γc. The boundary of the window can be obtained by assuming

−

D(γ)

|Pi = 0, yielding

5

γc = (C 2/3

V 2/3)3/2.

−

(16)

The striking feature happens at γ =

γc, there exists a critical point T ∗

1 (zc, π) with

−

D(γc)

1 = 0, as we have shown in Ref. [8], we can prove that this point is a limit
|T ∗

point, and a pair of topological particles P3 and P4 generating with opposite charge

1 and +1 respectively, both of the new topological particles lie on the line ϕ = π.

−
One of the original topological particle, P2 with charge +1 on the line ϕ = π, moves

smoothly up to γ = γc, where it collides with P3 and annihilates with it at another

zc, π). The other, P1, which lies on the line ϕ = 0, still moves safely

limit point T ∗
2 (

−

with γ.

As pointed out by B. Wu and Q. Niu [9], when the interaction is strong enough

(C/V > 1), a loop appears at the tip of the lower adiabatic level when C/V > 1

while

γc ≤
−
For γ <

γ

≤

−

γc. We show the interesting structure in Fig. 2 in which C/V = 2.

γc, there are two adiabatic levels, the upper level corresponds to the

topological particle P1, the lower one corresponds to the topological particle P2; for

γ > γc, there are also only two adiabatical levels, but at this time the lower one

corresponds to P4 while the upper one still corresponds to P1. The arc part of the

loop on the tip of lower level when

γc < γ < γc just corresponds to P3, which

−

merges with the level corresponding to P4 at the point M on the left and with the

one corresponding to P1 at the point T on the right.

From the above discussion, one ﬁnds that when the structure of the topological

current is changed by generating or annihilating a pair of topological particles ( the

upper panel of Fig. 2), at the same time, the physical structure is changed by adding

two energy levels or subtracting two energy levels respectively (the lower panel of

Fig.2). The critical behaviors happen at the limit points where D(γc)

1,2 = 0 .
|T ∗

In fact, this nonlinear two-level model is of comprehensive interest for it asso-

ciates with a wide range of concrete physical systems, e.g., BEC in an optical lattice

[10] or in a double-well potential [11], and the motion of small polarons [12]. So, the

relation between topological particles and physical inner structure can be observed

6

in experimental methods. Here we propose a perspective system for observing the

striking phenomenon: a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential [11,13].

The amplitudes of general occupations N1,2(t) and phases ϕ1,2 obey the nonlinear

two-mode Schr¨odinger equations, approximately [13],

with φ1,2 =

N1,2exp(iϕ1,2), and total number of atoms N1 +N2 = NT , is conserved.

Here E0

1,2 are zero-point energy in each well, U1,2N1,2 are proportional to the atomic

q

self-interaction energy, and K describes the amplitude of the tunnelling between the

condensates. After introducing the new variables z(t) = (N2(t)

N1(t))/NT and

−

ϕ1, one also obtain an equations having the same form as Eqs. (7) and

ϕ = ϕ2 −

U2)NT /2]/¯h,

V = 2K/¯h, C = (U1 + U2)NT /2¯h.

With these explicit expressions, our theory and results can be directly applied to

this system without intrinsic diﬃculty. In this system the topological particles can

be located by the stable occupation and relative phase ϕ = 0 or ϕ = π for a give

parameter γ. And, one can draw the zero line of each topological particle by giving

diﬀerent γ. We hope our discussions will stimulate the experimental works in the

direction.

We note that for a system the global property (topology) is given, the interest-

ing feature is that under the same topology the topological conﬁguration can be

diﬀerent, this diﬀerence must correspond the diﬀerent physical structure. This re-

lation between topological conﬁguration and physical structure gives an important

property to classify some physical system which contains many diﬀerent structures.

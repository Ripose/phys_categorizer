Abstract

Future space missions, TPF and Darwin will focus on searches of
signatures of life on extrasolar planets. In this paper we look for model
independ deﬁnition of the habitable zone. It will be shown that the
radius of the habitable sphere depends only on the constants of the
Nature, α, ¯h, c.

Key words: Habitable sphere; Fine structure constant α.

Introduction

The existence of Extra-Solar planets is well established. In the contemporary
status of the searching program (e. g. DARWIN space infrared interferometer
project) the following categories of extra-solar planets are described: Deﬁnite
planets (20), possible planets (8), microlensed planets (5), borderline planets
(2), dust clump planets (7) and pulsar planets (4), number in paranthesis
denotes the number of planet.1
It is well known that round the Sun the
habitable zone – Ecosphere exists. Within the Sun Ecosphere are: Venus,
Earth and Mars and Sun. It will be interesting to calculate the Ecosphere
3/2
G mp (aG = the gravity ﬁne
radius for “average” star with mass Ms = a
structure constant and mp = proton mass).

To that aim in this paper we investigate the possibility of the calculations
of the planet orbit radii as the function of the ﬁne structure constant α. We
argue that the Ecosphere is deﬁned as the part of space rounded the star
which can be calculated assuming the present day value of the electromag-
netic ﬁne structure constant. Considering the existence of the ,,niche” for
ﬁne structure constant we calculate the niche for planet orbit radii and obtain
Rrel = R(α)/R(α = 1/137) = 0.5 − 1.5 where Rrel denotes the relative orbit
radii. In the case of the Solar system in Ecosphere we ﬁnd out the orbits of
Venus, Earth and Mars. Considering the agreement of the calculation with
the Ecosphere radius for Solar system we argue that our model for habitable
zone can be applied to other planet systems also.

Coincidence

In paper [1] the quantum heat transport on the atomic, nuclear and quark
scale was discussed and the characteristic time scales were obtained. For
atomic scale:

where me is electron mass, α is the electromagnetic ﬁne structure constant,
c is the light velocity. For nuclear scale:

τn =

mn(αs)2c2 ,

where mn denotes nucleon mass, αs ∼ 0.15 is the coupling constant for strong
interactions. In the case of free quark gas (if it exist!):

s, mq are the ﬁne structure constant for quark-quark interaction and

and αq
quark mass respectively.

The atomic time scale, τa, is proportional to the ,,atomic year”, Ta, viz.:

where aB is the Bohr radius.

It is quite interesting to observe that the ,,coincidence” holds:

τq =

A Ta ∼ TEarth,
A mp = 1g,

where A is the Avogardo number, A = 6.02 1023, mp = 1.66 10−27 kg is the
proton mass and TEarth denotes the Earth year (in seconds).

From Kepler law the relation TEarth → REarth can be concluded:

2mEarthπ
(−mEarthK)1/2

Earth.

In formula (6) we approximate Earth orbit as the circle with radius REarth
and mEarth is the Earth mass, K is equal:

where G is gravity constant and M denotes the mass of the central body
(the Sun) which creates gravity forces. In the following we approximate the
M mass of the central body by the mass of the ,,average” star [2, 3]

K = −GmEarthM,

M ∼= a

G mp = Nmp,

where N = a
is the Landau-Chandrasekhar number, aG denotes the ﬁne
structure constant for gravity force. Comparing formulae (5) and (6) one
obtains:

In formula (9) for planet radius we omit the subscript ,,Earth” because the
radius does not depend on the planet mass. The R denotes the planet orbit
radius for average star with mass described by formula (8). The planet radius
depends only on the three fundamental constant of the Nature: G, ¯h, c. The
mass Mpl = ( ¯hc

G )1/2 is the Planck mass.

Considering formula (5), A mp=1 g the planet radius (9) can be formu-

lated in more ,,elegant” form:

R3/2 =

The dependence of R on α is quite interesting. For, it is well known that
grand uniﬁed theories allow very sharp limits to be placed on the possible
vales of the ﬁne structure constant in a cognizable universe. The possibility
of the doing physics on the background space-time at the uniﬁcation energy
and the existence of stars made of protons and neutrons endorse α in the
niche [4]:

It is interesting to observe that one obtains the niche for planet radii — the
Ecosphere which is the consequence of formulae (11) and (12). The Ecosphere
spans from Rrel ∼ 0.5 to Rrel ∼ 1.5.
In the case of the Solar system in
this niche we ﬁnd only the orbits of Venus Earth and on the border of the
Ecosphere: Mars.

Considering the agreement of the calculations present in this paper with
the habitable zone for Sun, we argue that our model for Ecosphere can be
applied to other planet systems (other “worlds”) also.

The habitable sphere is conservatively deﬁned as a shell region around a
star where liquid water can be found at the surface of the planet. this zone
is typically from about Rrel 0.95 Au to 1.37 AU. As we shown this ”life shell”
can be calculated as the function of the Nature constants α, ¯h, c.

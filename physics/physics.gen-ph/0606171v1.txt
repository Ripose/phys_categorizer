An elementary thought experiment is used to show that once the time dilatation eﬀect is established,

there is no way to escape a dual length contraction.

Introduction

3 Dual story

It has been argued recently [1] that the only real ef-
fect following from Einstein’s two postulates is time
dilatation and that length contraction is but an arti-
fact due to a confusion between arbitrary settings and
physically determined rates of clocks in various inertial
frames. We show that this contention can be easily re-
buted by a basic thought experiment.

2 Muon story

The slowing down of a moving clock with respect to
its stationnary twin is the most easily established con-
sequence of Einstein’s two postulates founding special
relativity. The well known light-clock thought experi-
ment allows to derive it in a couple of lines (see e.g. [2]
for a classic or [3] for a recent text making use of this
old device)
The reality of the eﬀect can be ascertained by the ob-
servation at ground level of muons produced by cosmic
rays impinging on the atomic nuclei in the upper at-
mosphere.
These muons, which are also abundantly produced in
numerous particle physics experiments, are known to
be unstable and to have an exponentially distributed
lifetime of mean value 2.2 microseconds in their rest
frame. This corresponds to a distance of 600 meters
from their production point at the speed of light. Thus
a muon produced at an altitude of 30 km would have a
probability smaller than 2.10−22 to reach the ground.
However, muons of cosmic origin are easily shown to be
abundant at sea level with the aid of simple apparatus.
Given the above probability, the sea level observed ﬂux
would probably mean a primary cosmic ray ﬂux lethal
to any form of life on our planet, if that probability
were not enormously increased by the slowing down
of the extremely relativistic muon ’clock’ in the Earth
rest frame. The fact that unstable particles live longer
when they move with velocities sizable with respect
to that of light is routinely checked and used by high
energy particle physicists.

The very same light-clock used in the preceding section
allows to show that a rigid rod measured in a frame in
which it is moving at a relativistic speed is contracted
in the direction of its motion by the same factor (for a
given speed) by which its acoompanying clock is slowed
down (see [3]).
This, however, is one of the eﬀects whose reality is ques-
tionned in [1]; it must be acknowledged that, contrary
to the time dilatation eﬀect, no experiment has ever
been performed which checks directly this contraction,
simply because their is no known way at present to ac-
celerate a macrospcopic object at relativistic speeds.
However, nothing forbids to imagine observers travel-
ing together with the cosmic muons that we considered
above. The muon and the observer being at rest rela-
tive to each other, the muon ’clock’ runs normally with
the mean lifetime already quoted. However, many of
these muons reach sea level before decaying, in spite of
their not being able to travel a distance much larger
than 600 meters as determined by their accompany-
ing observers. The only possible explanation is that
the atmosphere is much thiner to them than it is to
earth-bound observers. It is reduced to something not
much thicker than 600 meters because of the Lorentz
length contraction. There is no escaping this conclu-
sion. Length contraction and time dilatation are dual
eﬀects which imply each other. Therefore the con-
tention of [1] cannot be correct. The magnetic force
undergone by a charge moving in the vicinity of a cur-
rent carrying wire is a slightly indirect but quite con-
vincing demonstration of the same phenomenon (see
[4])

Abstract

Birefringence phenomena stemming from vacuum polarization are revisited in the framework of co-
herent scattering. Based on photon-photon scattering, our analysis brings out the direct connection
between this process and vacuum birefringence. We show how this procedure can be extended to the
Kerr and the Cotton-Mouton birefringences in vacuum, thus providing a uniﬁed treatment of various
polarization schemes, including those involving static ﬁelds.

Introduction

Non-linear optical eﬀects stemming from the presence of virtual electron-positron pairs in vacuum
are a fundamental feature of quantum ﬁeld theory [1]. Among them, vacuum birefringence produced
by a static electromagnetic ﬁeld has been studied since the late ﬁfties (for references of early works,
see [2]) and, later on, other non-linear eﬀects have been considered, such as second-harmonic gener-
ation [3], generation of interacting modes in wave-guides [4], or self-interaction eﬀects between photons [4].

This paper focuses on vacuum birefringence. Besides the Kerr birefringence due to an electric ﬁeld
and the Cotton-Mouton birefringence due to a magnetic one, magnetoelectric birefringences have been
predicted by Rikken and Rizzo [5, 6] to take place in vacuum when crossed electric and magnetic
ﬁelds are applied either perpendicularly or parallel to the direction of light propagation. Vacuum bire-
fringence produced by an intense laser radiation ﬁeld was previously investigated by Aleksandrov et al. [7].

Experiments – either ongoing or in preparation – aim at a direct detection of these very small eﬀects
and this goal is usually combined with an axion search [8]. Prospects for an increase of the experimental
sensitivity are also being investigated [9, 10].

Most authors base their calculations of optical non-linear eﬀects in vacuum – including birefringence

– on the Heisenberg-Euler eﬀective Lagrangian [1]

The connection between vacuum birefringence and light-light scattering is often mentioned in this
context (see e.g. references [2]). However, to our knowledge, this connection has not yet been exploited
to compute vacuum refractive indexes directly from the forward light-light scattering amplitude – at
least in the case where the polarization is produced by a single, ‘static’ ﬁeld as in the case of the Kerr
and the Cotton-Mouton birefringences.

Our goal is to obtain the refraction indexes in various polarization conﬁgurations by using not the
Lagrangian of Eq. (1), but the forward light-light scattering amplitude. This approach brings out the
similarity between birefringence in vacuum and birefringence in material media.

In the following section, we will recall the classic relation between refractive indexes and forward
scattering amplitudes. Next, we will recall the expression of these amplitudes in the case of light-light
scattering. These results will ﬁrst be used to compute the phase velocity of two (intense) head-on polarized
light waves. Then, we will show how this formalism can be extended to ‘static’ ﬁelds like those which
produce the Kerr and the Cotton-Mouton eﬀects. Finally, we will treat a few other ﬁeld conﬁgurations
that involve both an electric ﬁeld and a magnetic one.

2 Relation between the refractive index and the forward scat-

tering amplitude

Let us consider a plane wave ψ of unit amplitude whose quanta of energy ω are supposed to have zero
mass and no spin for simplicity. We suppose that ψ propagates in the positive direction of a z axis and
we assume that the z < 0 region is the vacuum, while the z > 0 region is a medium (here supposed
at rest) that contains scattering centers randomly distributed with an average number density N . We
further assume that N is large enough so that the average distance between any center and its closest
neighbours is much smaller than the wavelength λ = 2π/k of the incident wave. Then, in the z < 0
region, ψ = ei(ωt−kz), while in the z > 0 region, ψ = ei(ωt−nkz), where n is the refractive index of the
medium. Assuming that the elastic scattering of ψ by any of the scattering centers gives rise to a wave
of the form f (θ)ei(ωt−kr)/r, one may establish [11]) the relation

n = 1 +

2π
ω2 N f (0).

(2)

In the following, we will be concerned with the photon-photon scattering amplitude. Quantum elec-
trodynamics allows one to obtain the amplitude f (θ) in the form of a series of terms of order αn, the
ﬁrst non-vanishing one being of order α2. As long as the energy of the colliding photons is too low for
e+- e− pair production, this ﬁrst term is real for θ = 0. Thus we will be dealing with real refractive
indexes. The fact that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude,
[f (0)], vanishes to order
ℑ
α2 follows from the optical theorem, which states that
[f (0)] is proportional to the total cross section,
σelastic + σinelastic. At energies below the e+- e− pair production threshold, σinelastic = 0 since there
is no open inelastic channel, and σelastic is of order α4 since the elastic (diﬀerential) cross section is
proportional to

3 Photon-photon forward scattering amplitudes

In the case of photon-photon scattering, because these quanta carry a spin 1 and are observed in two
diﬀerent helicity states, ﬁve independent amplitudes are necessary to cover all scattering conﬁgurations.
The corresponding matrix elements can be read in an article by Karplus and Neuman [12].

Since the experimental investigation of birefringence eﬀects is done with linearly polarized light
waves, it is more convenient to use such waves to describe the polarization state of the incoming and the
outgoing photons. The matrix elements expressed in such a basis can be readily calculated from those
given in a helicity basis. One may also obtain them directly from Akhieser and Berestetskii [13] when
the center of mass energy is low compared to the mass of an e+- e− pair.

2

In fact we only need the forward elastic amplitudes with no spin-ﬂip. There are two of them: fk(0) and
f⊥(0). They correspond to incoming and outgoing waves whose electric ﬁelds oscillate in the same plane
(fk(0)) or in orthogonal planes (f⊥(0)). Some numerical and kinematical factors must be introduced to
translate the matrix elements that enter the cross section calculations into forward scattering amplitudes.

4 Vacuum polarization produced by an intense laser beam

The forward scattering amplitudes given by Eqs. (3) and (4) are all we need to apply Eq. (2) to various
polarization schemes. We ﬁrst take up the case where the polarization is produced by an intense laser
beam as it was ﬁrst analysed by Aleksandrov et al. [7].

Let two intense laser beams propagate in opposite directions. We assimilate them to two plane waves
and we suppose that they are linearly polarized in the ˆex direction. For deﬁniteness, we suppose that
wave (1) propagates in the positive z direction (like ψ above) while wave (2) propagates in the opposite
one. The electric ﬁelds of these two waves are then E1 = E1ei(ωt−kz+ϕ1)ˆex and E2 = E2ei(ωt+kz+ϕ2)ˆex,
assuming that the observations are made in the center of mass frame. ϕ1 and ϕ2 are arbitrary phases.

Each wave is scattered by the photons of the opposite one and thus has a phase velocity that diﬀers
very slightly from c. Let us apply Eq. (2) to the propagation of wave (1) (just the same analysis could
be applied to wave (2)), ignoring high order corrections due to the fact that wave (2) is aﬀected – very
little – by the presence of wave (1). For N one must take two times the space-averaged number density
of photons per unit volume in wave (2) :

N = 2

(E2)2/2ω.

×

The factor 2 introduced in this expression of N is best understood in the language of particle
physics. Indeed, we may assimilate the set of scattering centers to a ‘target’ through which wave (2) is
propagating. Then the relevant parameter is the target thickness

Inserting (3) and (5) into Eq. (2), we obtain

If waves (1) and (2) are polarized in orthogonal planes, the numerical coeﬃcient in Eq. (6) must be

replaced by 28

45 (cf. Eq. (4)). Thus

One notices that while the light-light forward scattering amplitude has a strong dependence upon the
energy ω, the three powers of ω that enter the expression (2) of the refractive index cancel out.

These results are in agreement with those of Aleksandrov et al. [7].

Up to now, we have assumed that we were working in the center of mass of the colliding photons but
Eqs. (6) and (7) remain valid when waves (1) and (2) have diﬀerent frequencies. Indeed, if the observations

5 Kerr and Cotton-Mouton birefringences in vacuum

One may wonder how this light-light scattering approach can be extended to the Kerr or the Cotton-
Mouton eﬀects since they involve static ﬁelds, E0 or B0, and only one of them at a time. The reason why
it can be done is that the wavelength of the polarizing wave – i.e. wave (2) in the preceding section – does
not enter Eqs. (6) or (7). Thus one may assume that the static ﬁeld is in fact produced by an electro-
magnetic wave propagating in the negative z direction and whose wavelength is long enough to create an
electric ﬁeld (or a magnetic one) as uniform as one wishes within the experimental apparatus. Of course,
a single wave would create both an electric and a magnetic ﬁeld, but either one can be cancelled by
assuming the presence of a second wave of the same amplitude but propagating in the positive z direction.

Let us apply this procedure to the Kerr eﬀect. We assume that it is produced in the vicinity of the
origin of our reference frame by an electric ﬁeld E0 = E0ˆex. We may suppose such a ﬁeld results (near
the origin, i.e. for z
0) from the presence of the following two waves: wave (2) whose electric ﬁeld is
E2 = (E0/2)ei(Ωt+Kz+φ)ˆex, and wave (2’) whose electric ﬁeld is E2′ = (E0/2)ei(Ωt−Kz+φ)ˆex, at the time
0 (one could relax this condition by making a diﬀerent choice of the waves’ common
t such that Ωt + φ
amplitude). The wave number K is chosen small enough – as well as the wave frequency Ω = Kc – so
that the ﬁeld uniformity is adequate within the experimental apparatus. The combination of these two
waves provides the desired electric ﬁeld while the total magnetic ﬁeld is vanishing.

≈

≈

Clearly, the photons of wave (2’) do not scatter wave (1) since they move in the same direction.
Therefore birefringence eﬀects will only come from wave (2) and one may apply the results of the previous
section with the following changes in Eqs. (6) and (7): The amplitude E0/2 must be substituted to
the amplitude E2, and the numerical factors must be multiplied by 2. The reason for this factor 2 is
the following. Photons are statistically distributed in space proportionnally to the square of the local
amplitude of the electromagnetic ﬁeld; since we chose Ωt + φ
0, at that particular time the number
density of photons near the origin is twice its space-averaged value. Thus, for the Kerr eﬀect,

The same analysis can be applied to the Cotton-Mouton eﬀect produced by a uniform magnetic ﬁeld
B0 oriented perpendicularly to the wave vector kˆez. Consequently, in order to obtain the refractive
indexes of the vacuum thus polarized, one has merely to substitute B0 to E0 and to perform the
45 in Eqs. (8). This interchange reﬂects the fact that, to produce B0, one has to
interchange 8
combine two waves whose electric ﬁelds are at right angle with the direction of B0.

These results reproduce e.g. those of Rikken and Rizzo [5].

6 More complex polarization schemes

We now consider the case treated by Rikken and Rizzo where the vacuum is polarized by a combination
of ‘static’ electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We ﬁrst assume that these ﬁelds are mutually orthogonal:
E0 = E0ˆey, B0 = B0ˆex. Note that, in accordance with [5], our polarizing ﬁelds are chosen so that the
E0, B0, ˆez

frame is left -handed when E0 and B0 have the same sign.

{

}

1Lorentz transformations are extensively exploited in Ref. [6]

4

Let us assume for a moment that E0 =

B0. Then the two ‘static’ ﬁelds can be produced by a single
wave – with a suﬃciently long wavelength – that travels in the positive z direction so that its photons
do not collide with those of wave (1). We can immediately conclude that such a ﬁeld conﬁguration does
not generate any birefringence (to order α2). This striking result also follows from Rikken and Rizzo’s
expressions for nk and n⊥ but, to our knowledge, it has not yet been pointed out nor interpreted so simply.

−

We now turn to the general case where E0 and B0 are not necessarily equal in magnitude. We assume
for deﬁniteness that both amplitudes are positive and that E0 > B0 (other cases can be treated in just
the same way) and let ∆ be the diﬀerence E0 - B0.

Such a ﬁeld conﬁguration can be produced by the superposition of three waves2, two of them (waves
(2) and (3)) that propagate in the z < 0 direction and one (wave (3’)) that propagates in the z > 0
direction. Their electric ﬁelds are, respectively, E2 = B0ei(Ωt+Kz+φ)ˆex, E3 = (∆/2)ei(Ωt+Kz+φ)ˆex and
E3′ = (∆/2)ei(Ωt−Kz+φ)ˆex.

As done above, we suppose that the birefringence eﬀect is observed near the origin of our frame of
0. Wave (3’) travels in the same direction as wave
reference (z
≈
(1) and thus does not generate any birefringence, while waves (2) and (3) combine coherently in a single
wave of amplitude B0 + ∆/2 = (E0 + B0)/2. According to Eqs. (6) and (7), the latter wave generates a
birefringence eﬀect with refractive indexes

they can also be derived

Finally, let us consider the case where the ‘static’ electric and magnetic ﬁelds that polarize the
vacuum are parallel. The most general conﬁguration where E0 6
= B0 can be treated along the same lines
as above. Here we will limit ourselves to the case where E0 = B0 and assume that these ﬁelds are both
in the ˆex direction. This ﬁeld conﬁguration may be regarded as resulting from the superposition of four
electromagnetic waves, all of amplitude E0/2: E2 = (E0/2)ei(Ωt+Kz+φ)ˆex, E2′ = (E0/2)ei(Ωt−Kz+φ)ˆex,
E3 = (E0/2)ei(Ωt+Kz+φ)ˆey and E3′ = (E0/2)ei(Ωt−Kz+φ)ˆey. Two of these waves propagate in the z > 0
direction and therefore do not interact with wave (1). The other two propagate in the z < 0 direction
and are polarized along ˆex for one and ˆey for the other. The latter two waves add coherently to produce
a single wave of amplitude E0/√2 oriented at π/4 with respect to the ˆex, ˆey axes. We conclude that such
a ﬁeld conﬁguration leads to birefringence axes oriented at
π/4 with respect of the direction common
to the polarizing ﬁelds.

7 Conclusion

We have shown how vacuum birefringence can be dealt with in the framework of coherent scattering
as is done for refraction eﬀects in dense material media. When the vacuum is polarized by an intense
light wave, we assign to the wave’s photons the role of the ‘dense medium’. We have further shown how
this procedure can be extended to the case where the vacuum is polarized by a static electromagnetic
ﬁeld. This is achieved by supposing that the static ﬁeld is actually produced by a superposition of waves
that propagate in opposite directions. With this approach, birefringence indexes previously calculated
by other authors are obtained in a straightforward way for various polarization schemes. It is hoped that
a new insight into the process that generates birefringence in vacuum is thus provided.

2This multiwave approach should not be confused with the so-called ‘Four-wave mixing’ scheme utilized in non-linear op-
tics where three electromagnetic waves interact to generate a fourth one whose characteristics follow from energy-momentum
conservation.

Abstract

In this paper we use considerations of non-commutative geome-
try to deduce a model for QCD interactions. The model also ex-
plains within the same theoretical framework hitherto purely phe-
nomenological characteristics of the quarks like their fractional charge,
mass,handedness and conﬁnement.

1 Introduction

In recent years it is being realized that an important assumption that has
been uncritically taken for granted in much of twentieth century Physics is
that space time forms a diﬀerentiable manifold. This is the case, for exam-
ple in the Riemannian General Relativity, and the Minkowski Space Time of
relativistic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory. It is only in re-
cent years that space time manifolds where we cannot go down to arbitrarily
small intervals have been considered in the context of, for example non-
commutative space time models, SuperString Theory and Quantum Gravity
and similar areas [1, 2, 3, 4].
Indeed it has been suggested by the author that once we discard the conven-
tional space time geometries and consider a non- commutative space time
then it is possible to reconcile the hitherto irreconcible pillars of the twen-
tieth century, namely General Relativity and Quantum Theory [5, 6, 7, 8].

We will now argue that from the same non- commutativity, it is possible to
also understand strong interactions and the quark picture.

2 Strong Interactions

Let us introduce the eﬀect of a non-commutative space time into the usual
metric, at some scale (l, τ )

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν

gµν = ηµν + hµν

If we split up the product dxµdxν into symmetric and non symmetric parts,
(1) will become

In (2), the ﬁrst term on the right side represents the usual metric, while the
second term represents the eﬀect of non- commutativity of the space time
coordinates viz.,

[x, y] = 0(l2), [x, px] = ı¯h[1 + l/¯h)2p2

x]etc.

Equation (3) can be deduced from relations that were worked out by Snyder
[9, 10], and subsequently by several other scholars over the past ﬁve decades
l
and more. Incidentally if in (3), we specialize to the Compton scale, i.e.
denotes the Compton wavelength (and similarly, τ , the Compton time), then,
we can infact deduce the Dirac equation of the electron [11, 12]. In other
words the non- commutativity is an ∼ 0(l2) eﬀect. Starting from (2), it has
been shown in detail that we can deduce the gravitational ﬁeld equations

where

2φµν = −kT µν

φµν = hµν −

ηµνh

(Cf.[5, 6]for details).
Equations (4) and (5) represent the linearized equations of General Relativity
[13].
Starting from equation (4), we have, as is well known, in suitable units,

gµν = ηµν + hµν, hµν =

It may be mentioned that in (6), velocities comparable to that of light are
allowed, and at the same time the stresses T ıj and momentum densities T 0j
can be comparable to the energy momentum density T 00.
It is well known that when

we have the equations

|~x′| << |~x|,

m =

T 00d3x

Z
ǫklmxlT m0d3x

Sk =

Z

(7)

(8)

where m is the mass and Sk is the angular momentum. In any case, as is
well known, (6) leads to the gravitational potential [13]. It may be mentioned
that integrals and derivatives within the non-commutative geometry are ap-
proximate, because, in any case, the eﬀects are, as pointed out, ∼ 0(l2).
We consider the integrals in (7) and (8) in a region bounded by the Compton
wavelength, because in any case, the density of the particle vanishes outside
this region, and hence, so also the energy momentum density T µν. Remem-
bering that the velocity at the Compton wavelength equals c, the velocity of
light, we can easily deduce from (8) that the angular momentum Sk is given
by,

that is the Quantum Mechanical spin half. (Cf.[12] for details]).
Indeed from an alternative viewpoint it has been shown that the non-commutative
relations (3) imply spin and conversely [14].
Let us now consider the case when

Then we have from (6), expanding in a Taylor series about t,

hµν = 4

where ω the frequency is given by,

ω =

Equation (10) can be derived in a simple way as follows: The non-commutative
relations (3) imply

y ≡ ˜hpx (cid:18)

˜h =

(Cf. ref. [7, 8]).
Whence we have

which leads to (10). Interestingly, this is also true in the theory of the Dirac
equation itself.
Using (10), we have,

so that,

where ω is given in (10). Substitution in (9) now gives,

hµν ≈

+ 8βM(

β being a constant.
This resembles the QCD quark potential [15]. In any case these considera-
tions suggest that we can get diﬀerent interactions at diﬀerent distances or
scales in a uniﬁed picture, which can approximately atleast represent quarks
also.

We can further reﬁne this argument. For this we will use the following rela-
tion already deduced (Cf.[12] and references therein for details):

Aσ =

outside the Compton wavelength.
As we approach the Compton wavelength however, we have to use equation
(9), which after a division by m, the mass of the particle to be identiﬁed with
the quark, and taking ¯h = 1 = c to correspond to the usual theory, goes over
to,

In (13) α ∼ 1andβ ∼ 1
potential with both the Coulumbic and conﬁning parts (Cf.ref.[15]).
We now observe that the usual three dimensionality of space, as pointed out
by Wheeler [13] arises due to the double connectivity or spinorial behaviour of
Fermions, which takes place outside the Compton wavelength due to the fact
that as has been seen elsewhere, while it is the negative energy components
of the Dirac four-spinor which dominate inside, it is the positive energy com-
ponents which predominate outside (cf.ref.[5, 12] for details). Such a three
dimensionality can also be deduced using Penrose’s spin network theory [16].
Interestingly, if we consider the Dirac equation in two (or one dimension)
[17, 18], we encounter handedness and the absence of an invariant mass -
features which in the light of our considerations arise at the Compton wave-
length. As we approach the Compton wavelength, we encounter mostly the
negative energy component and the above double connectivity and therefore
three dimensionality disappear: We have two or less dimensions. Indeed even
in the purely classical case of a collection of relativistic particles, the various
centres of mass form a two dimensional disk[19]. Such a conclusion has been

5

drawn alternatively at very small scales (cf.[20, 21]).
This leads to the following circumstance: We have to consider two and one
spatial dimensions. We now use the fact that as is well known [22] for each
dimension the Tıj in (9) or (12) is given by (1/3)ǫ, where ǫ is the energy den-
sity. In this case it follows from (12) that the particle would have the charge
(2/3)e or (1/3)e, in two or one dimensions.
Incidentally, this provides an
explanation for the remarkable and well known fact that one third of charge
appears to be concentrated in a core of the size of the order of the proton
Compton wavelength as was experimentally well established [23].
Using the fact that at the Compton wavelength the charge becomes e/3, and
d3r → l2dr owing to the single dimensionality in equation (12), and also
using equation (10) in (9) we get

(14)

where the last step follows from a comparison with the Coloumb part of (11)
or (13). Whence

m ∼ 103me
where m is the quark mass, remembering that in the above natural units,
l = 1
m .
Equation (14) is ofcourse correct. Infact using the quark mass given in (14) in
(11) or (13), it is easy to see that the ratio of the coeﬃcients of the conﬁning
and Coulumbic parts is ∼ (Gev)2 which is also true [15].
Thus the quark and QCD identiﬁcation is complete, and also at the same
time a theoretical rationale for the mass, fractional charges and handedness
of the quark has now been obtained. As noted by Salam, these were hitherto
not explained theoretically [24].
This would also automatically imply that these fractionally charged particles
cannot be observed individually, as they by their very nature appear when
conﬁned to dimensions of the order of their Compton wavelength. This is
expressed by the conﬁning part of the QCD potential (11) or (13).

3 Remarks

We would like to reemphasize that our model gives the mass (order of magni-
tude), the fractional charge, the handedness and the conﬁnement feature of

6

quarks correctly. Experimentally, a charge e/3 has been observed within the
quark Compton wavelength, as pointed out. The correct phenomenological
QCD potential also is obtained.
A ﬁnal remark: In the above considerations, we had specialized to the Comp-
ton wavelength. We can see from an alternative and simple point of view,
how the compton scale emerges. For this we use the fact that in the Dirac
theory of the electron, we have (Cf.ref.[14, 25])

the Compton scale, within which non-commutative and non-Hermitian eﬀects
come into play.

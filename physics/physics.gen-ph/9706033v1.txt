Introduction

Many physicists believe that the Friedmann models [1,2,3] describe the expanding phenomena

of the space of the universe, and they accept the models as a standard cosmological model.

However, the models have many problems. The scale factor R in the models has no exact

meaning and is an unobservable quantity, that is, R is not an astrophysical quantity but only a

mathematical one. Thus the models do not agree with Hubble’s observations [4,5] completely.

The Hubble’s law (V = H0D, Fig.1) states that the distance between two neighbouring galax-

ies increases with time. If the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, the increasing distance

means that the radius or the diameter of the universe is increasing. Therefore, the scale of the

radius of the universe depends on the distance between two neighbouring galaxies. However,

the Friedmann models do not represent this fact.

The energy tensors (Tik) in the Friedmann models only have a contribution from the mass den-

sity of the galaxies. Therefore, the models should only describe the expansion of the present

universe. However, the models are also used to expansion of the early universe.

An expansion age of the universe estimated by the Friedmann model does not agree with the

experimental data [6], that is, the age of the Friedmann universe is smaller than that of the

components (stars or galaxies) of the real universe. Recent measurements using the Hubble

Space Telescope [7] and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope [8] have given the Hubble con-
stant H0=80 Kms−1Mpc−1 and 87 Kms−1Mpc−1, respectively. According to the Friedmann
model these values give an expansion age of 8 × 109yrs and 7 × 109yrs, respectively. Theses
ages lie below the age of globular clusters (10 − 18 × 109yrs) obtained from stellar evolution

theory [9].

The most important problem in the Friedmann models is the spacetime singularity. First, it

is very diﬃcult to imagine a universe that has a zero radius at the time zero. That is, with a

gravitation theory we cannot explain the creation of the space of the universe, since the theory

describes the interaction of matter. We must deﬁne the concept of the universe. The universe
is a very large group of 1011 galaxies in an inﬁnite space, and the galaxies in the components

of the universe, i.e.

local group, cluster and supercluster, are connected through gravitation.

The space of the universe is just a space ﬁlled by these galaxies. Therefore, the space of the

2

universe is only a subspace of the inﬁnite space and cannot have been created by the big bang

or a physical process. However, the spacetime singularity confuses this concept of the universe.

Thus a few astronomers [10,11] proposed the steady state theory for an expanding universe.

Second, general relativity cannot be applied to the early universe in particle form, since the

particle is the source of neither the weak nor the strong ﬁeld. However, the spacetime singu-

larity compelled us to apply the theory to the early universe. Third, according to the big bang

model the temperature of the universe was nearly inﬁnite at the big bang epoch. However, the

universe should have an upper limit in temperature. Fourth, the singularity gave rise to the

horizon and the ﬂatness problems in the initial phase of the universe. The inﬂationary universe

[12,13,14] is an alternative model for a solution of these problems. However, the model cannot

fundamentally solve the singularity problem.

If a model for an expanding universe agrees completely with the Hubble’s law, the model should

have no singularity, since the Hubble’s law has no singularity and is valid only for the expanding

phenomena of the present universe. If the singularity is due to general relativity [15], the theory

is not a complete theory, since a gravitation theory cannot describe the creation and the anni-

hilation of the space of the universe. However, the singularity is due not to the incompleteness

of general relativity but to a careless investigation of the spacetime geometry. We can avoid

the singularity if we study the geometry carefully.

2 New geometrical investigation of the present uni-

verse

The main purpose of relativistic cosmology is to describe how 1011 galaxies move relative to

the centre of the universe. We assume that the galaxies are isotropically and homogeneously

distributed in the space of the universe [16], and we take the Weyl postulate [17] for the simplic-

ity of calculations. Under these assumptions, the line element in four-dimensional spacetime
coordinates x0, x1, x2 and x3 has the following form

ds2 = (dx0)2 − dσ2,

3

(1)

where dσ2 = P gikdxidxk (i,k=1,2,3) and is the metric on one of the spherical hypersurfaces

othogonal to the world line of galaxies.

We must express the metric dσ2 in spherical coordinates. To to this, we consider a hypersphere

of the radius R and embed it in the Cartesian coordinates. In terms of the Cartesian coordinates

x1, x2, x3 and x4, the equation of the surface of the four-dimensional hypersphere with constant

positive curvature is given by

1 + x2
x2

2 + x2

3 + x2

4 = R2,

where the radius R of the hypersphere is a constant in the Cartesian coordinates and corresponds

to the radius of universe in the spacetime coordinates. If we choose the following coordinates

x1 = Rsinhαcosθ, x2 = Rsinhαsinθcosφ, x3 = Rsinhαsinθsinφ, x4 = Rcoshα,

with z = sinhα we get the metric

dσ2 = R2[

dz2
1 − z2 + z2(dθ2 + sin2θdφ2)].

dσ2 is the metric on the surface of the hypersphere of the radius R. In order to obtain a time-
dependent metric dσ2 in the Cartesian coordinates, we must change the radius R. However,

we cannot directly insert R(t) instead of R in (3), since R is a constant in the Cartesian

coordinates. We must distinguish a hypersphere in the Cartesian coordinates from one in

the spacetime coordinate. The radius R should be a constant in the Cartesian coordinates.

Therefore, we must choose a hypersphere with the radius 6= R and ﬁnd it in the real universe

represented by the spacetime coordinates. That is, we must ﬁnd a time-dependent variable

that is proportional to the radius of the universe. According to the Hubble’s law, the variable

is the distance r between two neighbouring galaxies. It can be geometrically realized as follows.

Let us consider a cross section that contains the centre of the hypersphere in the Cartesian

coordinates. The cross section is a circle of the radius R which corresponds to the cross section

that contains the centre of the universe in the spacetime coordinates. We must consider the

distribution of galaxies in the cross section. Since we assumed an isotropic and homogeneous

distribution of the galaxies, the relation between R and r can be approximated in the cross

section as follows (see Fig.2)

(2)

(3)

(4)

R = Ar + B,

4

where A is the number of galaxies on an axis and B is the product of A and D (diameter of

galaxy). We must note that R is not a constant in the spacetime coordinates.

We return to the Cartesian coordinates. Let us consider a cross section of the radius r in the

spacetime coordinates as in Figure 2. The cross section of the radius r corresponds to that

of the hypersphere of the radius r in the Cartesian coordinates. From now on we consider a

hypersphere of the radius r instead of one of the radius R. We embed the hypersphere of the

radius r in the Cartesian coordinates. Inserting r(t) instead of R in eq.(3), we obtain

dσ2 = r2(t)[

dz2
1 − z2 + z2(dθ2 + sin2θdφ2)].

dσ2 is the time-dependent metric on the surface of the hypersphere of the radius r. r depends

only on t and corresponds to the distance between two neighbouring galaxies in the spacetime

coordinates. Since there is no relation between r and R in the Cartesian coordinates, R is a

constant. With the curvature parameter k we obtain a time-dependent line element

ds2 = c2dt2 − r2(t)[

dz2
1 − kz2 + z2(dθ2 + sin2θdφ2)].

With the line element we can solve the Einstein equations

Setting the spacetime coordinates (x0, x1, x2, x3) and the Cartesian coordinates (ct, z, θ, φ)as

we get the nontrivial equations from the Einstein equations with ˙r = dr/dt

The energy tensors of matter have the following forms

In the case of the system of galaxy behaving like dust the energy tensors (11) have speciﬁc

In the case of positive curvature (k=+1) eq.(15) can be rewritten

withβ given by

H0 is the Hubble constant and q0 is the deceleration parameter. Eq.(16) has the solution

This is the distance between two neighbouring galaxies. The distance increases with time. This

is the reason why the universe expands. The radius R of the universe is obtained by inserting

the solution in eq.(4)

The radius oscillates between minimum value B and maximum Aβ + B, that is, the galaxies

go ﬁrst away from the centre of the universe and then move for the centre (Fig.3).

In the cases of k=0 and k=-1 eq.(15) can be solved. In these cases the radius of the universe is

illustrated in Fig.4 and Fig.5. The universe expands forever. The spacetime singularity exists

no more in the radius of the universe.

3 Discussion

We solved the spacetime singularity problem in relativistic cosmology by using an additional

variable r. The singularity is due not to the incompleteness of general theory but to a careless

investigation of the spacetime geometry. The relativistic cosmology becomes complete with the

dimensions.

Although the spacetime singularity was removed in the radius of the universe, the singularity

still exists in the distance between two galaxies. The singularity means that the distance was

zero after formation of the galaxies and that they collide with each other again. However, in

the real universe the galaxies should have a minimum distance after their formation, that is, the

universe is expanding from the minimum. Therefore, the singularity should be also removed.

However, it is impossible since general relativity is a relativistic theory of gravitation in four

The spacetime geometry does not explain why the distance between two galaxies increases or

decreases, since general relativity is a purely mathematical theory of gravitation. We need a

nonrelativistic and dynamical theory of gravitation for a more exact description of the expand-

ing and contracting phenomena of our universe [18]. The physics of the early universe should

be reconstructed in a reasonable and scientiﬁcal manner.

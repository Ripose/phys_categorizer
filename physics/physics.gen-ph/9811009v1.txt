Abstract

An exotic spacecraft propulsion technology is described which ex-
ploits parity violation in weak interactions. Anisotropic neutrino emis-
sion from a polarized assembly of weakly interacting particles converts
rest mass directly to spacecraft impulse.

1 Introduction

The photon rocket has long been a familiar example of special relativistic
kinematics [1]. The speed of light as the ultimate rocket exhaust velocity also
surfaces in discussions of interstellar travel [2]. But few regard the photon
rocket as even remotely practical. This Note outlines a method of spacecraft
propulsion which resembles the photon rocket closely, and which appears, in
principle, capable of reduction to practice.

Parity nonconservation in the weak interaction can produce thrust by
anisotropic neutrino emission from a polarized assembly of weakly unstable
particles or nuclei. A conceptual propulsion system, in which decay or nuclear
capture of muons from the annihilation of bulk antimatter generates thrust,
illustrates the principles involved.

This scheme may be considered a variant on propulsion methods based
upon reaction from radioactive decay products, which have appeared in the
literature at intervals since their proposal by Goddard and Tsiolkovsky early
in this century [3, 4]. It is distinct from these in that the decay particles are

1

collisionless and electrically neutral, that the anisotropy of parity-violating
weak decays resolves the otherwise intractable problem of collimation, and
that the small cross section for neutrino interactions with other matter per-
mits thrust generation to take place as a volume, instead of as a surface,
eﬀect.

2 Physical Principles

2.1 Parity nonconservation and thrust generation

Consider a nucleus of spin J polarized along z which captures a light particle,
accompanied by the emission of a neutrino with energy Q, momentum q =
Q/c. The capture imparts to the daughter nucleus momentum q directed
opposite to the neutrino, along with a small recoil energy. As the only
preferred axis is the parent nuclear spin J, the rate may be written as a
Legendre polynomial expansion in cos(θ) = q

J/qJ:

I(θ) =

alPl(cos(θ))

(1)

·

Xl

Because J is an axial vector, while q is a polar vector, their inner product
is a psuedoscalar, which is odd under parity. In spherical coordinates, the
eﬀect of the parity operator is to transform θ to π
θ. Terms which do not
conserve parity thus appear as odd harmonics in eqn. 1. As a result, the
average impulse per capture along z

does not vanish. Only a nonvanishing a1 coeﬃcient allows neutrinos to trans-
port a net momentum ﬂux. One concludes that an interaction which con-
serves parity cannot transport a net ﬂux of momentum from a polarized
assembly of unstable particles, that a decay whose angular intensity contains
a linear term in cos(θ) will violate parity, and that only such an intensity
pattern can produce thrust.

2.2 Microscopic basis of thrust generation

The weak processes considered here involve muons produced by charged pion
decay following proton-antiproton annihilation. Muons decay by emission

2

of electron and muon neutrinos in a three-body process. The spectrum of
free positive muon decay at rest [5] gives < qz >= Q/10 for the average
momentum carried away by neutrinos, or η+ = 1/10. Negative muons also
undergo nuclear capture, subsequently emitting neutrons in over 95 % of
captures. Collimated neutrino emission results from muon capture in which
either the muon or a nonzero spin target nucleus is polarized.

The conversion eﬃciency η− for negative muon capture by a polarized
nucleus is calculated following [6], incorporating polarization eﬀects after [7].
It will be assumed that capture is dominated by L = 1 and L = 2 multipoles,
that recoil corrections O(v/c) can be neglected and, initially, that the nucleus
is 100 % polarized and the muon unpolarized. Nuclear matrix elements for
individual transitions are computed with a modiﬁed closure approximation [8]
in the pure shell model [9]. (The net eﬀect of interference terms is estimated
to be O(recoil) for medium-mass nuclei.)

In this manner one may estimate η− for transitions to a speciﬁed ﬁnal
angular momentum and parity. Its magnitude typically lies between 0.25 and
0.3 at the upper end, but can take on values near zero.

Detailed calculations of muon capture [10] ﬁnd the capture strength con-
centrated in a small number of ﬁnal spin/parity states. L = 1 transitions
to states of high spin appear favored, with 65-75 % of the capture going to
It appears reasonable to assume target nuclei exist with net
these states.
eﬃciency η− in the range 0.15-0.25, within recoil corrections O(0.04).

Hyperﬁne coupling between the target nucleus and an unpolarized 1S
muon will polarize the muon spin slightly at the expense of the target nu-
cleus spin [11]. For high nuclear spins, the polarization loss is small. Muon
polarization alters the relative importance of transverse and longitudinal mul-
tipoles [12] so as to increase η− somewhat, by perhaps 25- 33 % of its mag-
nitude for unpolarized muons in favorable cases.

An estimate for η− of ca. 0.2 is taken in the following.

3 Propulsion System Concept

The propulsion system operates, in outline, as follows: annihilation yields,
after free decay of prompt annihilation products, about 3.16 π± and 1.85 π0’s
[13]. It is assumed that neutral annihilation products are discarded so as to
contribute negligibly to waste heat production. Muons from pion decay are
decelerated to low energies. Positive muons are stopped and (rapidly) polar-

3

ized, then decay. A polarized nuclear target stops and captures the negative
muons, resulting in a neutron ﬂux. The neutrons are moderated and captured
in an isotopic mix of nuclei which regenerates the initial target isotope. Both
the absorbers which decelerate the muons and the thrust-generating inter-
action regions are coupled to a high thermal power, low speciﬁc mass waste
heat rejection system.

3.1 Conversion eﬃciency

A simple estimate of pion energetics following annihilation results from the
pion multiplicities on the assumption that pions share the available mass-
energy equally. The resulting mean pion kinetic energy is 236 MeV. Pions
are assumed to decay in ﬂight. Muon neutrinos from charged pion decay
carry oﬀ about 90 MeV on average. It is assumed that charge separation of
muons may be achieved with gradient drift, and that they are brought to low
kinetic energy by suitable absorbers. Because of the spread in annihilation
product kinetic energy, this process requires a degree of momentum sorting.
The fraction of proton pair mass that appears as muon rest mass is

α =

nπ±mµ
2mp

(3)

(4)

(in an obvious notation), divided equally between charge states. Combining
the conversion eﬃciency for free positive muon decay with that for negative
muon capture, adjusted for losses from residual nuclear excitation, leads to
an overall, ideal eﬃciency estimate

3.2 Muon interactions

Stopped positive muons form muonium with unpaired electrons in most sub-
stances. It is assumed that dynamical polarization by muonium hyperﬁne
coupling in a strong magnetic ﬁeld polarizes muons rapidly compared to their
lifetime, whereupon their free decay imparts impulse. The thermal energy
deposited in the ultimate target medium by a stopping muon should not,
therefore, exceed the hyperﬁne splitting.

Negative muons are made to stop in a highly polarized target of a suitable
nucleus such as 51V or 55Mn, whose most probable muon capture daughters

so), they overwhelmingly undergo nuclear capture from the muonic 1S state
instead of free decay [14].

The target may be gaseous [15]. Negative muons can deposit signiﬁcant
heat in the capture target without compromising nuclear polarization, and
thus only require coarse momentum sorting. In fact, muon capture probably
must occur in a conﬁned plasma, because hyperﬁne coupling between K
and L-shell atomic electrons in the target and the 1S muon-also subject to
hyperﬁne coupling with the target nucleus-poses a risk of catastrophic loss
of target nuclear polarization. A thermal energy of 0.5 keV, or just less than
5

106 K, suﬃces for most medium-mass nuclei [11].

×

3.3 Neutron issues

The daughter nucleus deexcites mainly by neutron emission. It is proposed
to recover the target nucleus for subsequent reuse by operating a catalytic
neutron capture chain on daughter nuclei.

Recovery begins with moderation of the neutrons to thermal energies in
16O. A jacket
a low-neutron absorption moderator such as graphite or D2
composed of lighter isotopes of the daughter nucleus captures the neutrons,
thus running a neutron capture chain terminating in an isobar of the original
nucleus that quickly decays back to the parent isotope. Chemical separation
of the parent isotope completes the chain.

Proton and alpha channels cause some leakage out of the chain. However,
the nuclei are not lost to the system. Daughter nuclei from (µ−, np) or (µ−, α)
reactions lie on the neutron-rich side of stability and will consequently β-
decay back to the stability line. An extra neutron capture or two reinserts
them into the main chain. Neutrons to supply this loss come from diverting
a fraction of the negative muon ﬂux to capture in heavy nuclides whose
composition is otherwise immaterial. An estimate based upon the neutron
multiplicity per muon capture [14] indicates that a 0.01 penalty to η, of recoil
order, suﬃces to redress a 3 % nucleon deﬁcit per capture.

3.4 Waste Heat Rejection

For purposes of discussion it will be assumed that waste heat is rejected
by liquid droplet radiators. Nordley [16] estimates that a speciﬁc mass of

5

10−5 kg/Wt at an outlet temperature of 900 K represents an attainable ex-
tension of liquid droplet radiator performance. In the present instance, in
which no penalty accrues to high operating temperatures, it seems permis-
sible to conjecture that radiators may use as a working ﬂuid a refractory
metal at an outlet temperature in the low 2000 K’s. If evaporation losses are
low enough, and the nonradiating mass depends weakly upon temperatures,
then the speciﬁc mass of a liquid drop radiator scales as a function of the
working ﬂuid inlet and outlet temperatures only [17]. Estimates for a variety
of candidate working ﬂuids indicate speciﬁc masses of order 10−7 kg/Wt can
probably be attained, but extension to greatly lower values appears diﬃcult.

tron moderator and catalytic chain absorber (governed by neutron scattering
and absorption lengths, respectively) are, along with those of other propul-
sion plant components, assumed to scale weakly with power. The high waste
heat power levels expected in this concept suggest examining the extreme

3.5.2 Pellet stream

The limit of ram augmentation occurs when a stream of fuel pellets is launched
in advance of the spacecraft with a tailored proﬁle of pellet speeds and launch
times, so that the spacecraft ingests each fuel pellet at zero velocity in its
proper frame [18]. For the pellet stream,

Modiﬁcations to eqn. (6) for ram-augmented systems are second order
in v/c. For the augmented variants, the distance traveled is computed by
numerical integration of eqn. (12) but with ǫ replaced by ǫ/2 in order to
maintain consistency with the simple rocket.

4 Performance Estimates

Consider a rendezvous mission with a star at a distance of 10 pc, and with a
duration held ﬁxed at 1000 years. Table 1 displays mission proﬁles for hybrids
of pure neutrino rocket, ram- and pellet-augmented rocket, and photon sail
acceleration at 0.3 gravities [18].

There is a critical value of ǫ below which it is impossible to travel 10 pc
in 1000 years. The ram/ram proﬁle requires ǫc = 23.6. Other proﬁles in the
table have smaller critical values. The photon beam/ram deceleration proﬁle
evidently has the greatest latitude in this regard; for η = 0.025, ǫc = 2.0. If
the eﬃciency is as low as η = 0.015, ǫc = 3.2. The mass ratio for this last
example is 2.64.

5 Discussion

The propulsion system concept outlined above delivers semirelativistic ra-
pidity changes for modest mass ratios, but does so at comparatively low
eﬃciency. The ineﬃciency arises from the small charged pion multiplicity
from annihilation at rest. Purely neutrino- powered examples have been de-
scribed to illustrate the principle most directly, and for comparison with the
classical photon rocket. One would doubtless prefer to treat that portion of
annihilation energy which cannot be converted into collimated muon neu-
trinos as something other than waste heat; to generate thrust with it! The

8

neutrino rocket may furnish a topping cycle for some other, presumably more
eﬃcient, method of annihilation-based propulsion.

Comment on “Nuclear Emissions During Self-Nucleated
Acoustic Cavitation”

In a recent Letter[1], Taleyarkhan and coworkers claim to
observe DD fusion produced by acoustic cavitation. Among
other evidence, they provide a proton recoil spectrum that
they interpret as arising from 2.45 MeV DD fusion neu-
trons. My analysis concludes the spectrum is inconsis-
tent with 2.45 MeV neutrons, cosmic background, and a
239PuBe source, but it is consistent with a 252Cf source.

Fig. 1a shows the detector’s pulse height spectra of two g
calibration sources, as extracted from Fig. 8 of the Letter’s
supplement[2]. Using GEANT4[3] to simulate photon and
electron transport, I calculate the electron recoil spectrum,
which I then convolve with a gaussian and scale to ﬁt the mea-
sured spectrum[4]. The two ﬁts provide the parameters for
the light output function L = c (E − E0), and the resolution
function[5] h 2 = a + b /E.

Fig. 1b shows simulated[3] proton spectra ﬁt to data ex-
I convert the energy de-
tracted from Fig. 4 of the Letter.
posited by proton recoil to equivalent electron energy[6],
smear the equivalent electron energy according to the resolu-
tion function, and then convert the smeared response to chan-
nel number using the light output function. These techniques
were used to accurately predict a DD fusion proton recoil
spectrum in Ref. [7].

and the theoretical ‘on’ curve is the sum of the double ex-
ponential and the vertically scaled Monte Carlo proton recoil
spectrum. I use the c 2
l ,p variable of Ref. [8] to both determine
the best ﬁt parameters and to test the goodness-of-ﬁt.

I analyze two limiting cases of 2.45 MeV neutron emis-
sion — no shielding and heavy shielding[11]. In both cases,
the detector is placed 30 cm from the ﬂask containing the cav-
itation ﬂuid, as described in the Letter and supplement. Both
radioisotope[9, 10] simulations are performed without shield-
ing. The ﬁt results are summarized in Table I.

I rule out the possibility of cavitation ‘on’ runs being longer
than cavitation ‘off’ runs by comparing the shapes of the spec-
tra in Fig. 9b of the supplement. Calling channels ten and be-
low the ‘peak’ and channels eleven and above the ‘tail’, the ra-
tio of tail to peak counts with cavitation off is 291/764 = 0.38.
When cavitation is on, the tail becomes more pronounced so
that the ratio is 1216/835 = 1.5.

I perform the ﬁt simultaneously over raw cavitation ‘on’
and cavitation ‘off’ bins, as extracted from Fig. 9b of the sup-
plement. The theoretical ‘off’ curve is a double exponential,

[11] The ﬂask is inside a parafﬁn box enclosed on ﬁve sides with
10 cm thick walls. The sixth side is open to allow the detector a
clear view of the ﬂask.

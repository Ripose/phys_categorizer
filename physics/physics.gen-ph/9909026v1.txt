We advance an universal approach to the construction of kinematics in non-inertial
and, in particular, rotating reference frames. On its basis, a 10-dimensional space
including three projections of velocity vector and three turn angles in geometric space
as additional coordinates to time and geometric coordinates is introduced. In a speciﬁc
case, the turns in 10-space describe the uniform rotation of reference frame as well as
its accelerated motion. Transformations for coordinates and angular velocities are
derived. Deﬁnitions of dynamic quantities contain a fundamental constant Ω with
dimensionality of angular velocity and the maximal acceleration in addition to the
velocity of light. The special relativity relation between energy, impulse, and mass gets
changed for particles with moment of inertia. A wave equation obtained describes the
rotary and accelerated motions of light wave. A relation between particle moment and
the Planck constant representing Bohr’s postulate is added to de Broglie’s relations. A
generalized space-time which allows to consider kinematics for derivations of arbitrary
order is studied. Diﬀerential relations between velocity of arbitrary order and turn
angles in the generalized space-time are obtained.

It is well known that the non-relativistic view of global disk rotation with constant
angular velocity ω is in contradiction with the relativistic rule of composition of
velocities. It is believed that the rotating reference frame can not be realized at distances
larger than c/ω as the rotation velocity should not exceed the velocity of light. Despite
it the global rotation model is widely used in the description of relativistic eﬀects in
rotating frames such as the Sagnac eﬀect [1], the length contraction, the time dilation,
In doing so it is overlooked that the global disk rotation is

1. Introduction

Geometrical turns and Lorentz busts, i.e. turns in the pseudoplane (x, t), make full
Lorentz group. The derivations of turn parameters by time are angular velocity dθ/dt
and acceleration dv/dt. It is a serious reason for considering both angular velocity and
acceleration in the uniﬁed way.

The progress has been possible in understanding relativistic laws for accelerated
motion due to the Caianiello’s idea of the expansion of space-time through components
of four-velocity of particle [6]. The more important consequence of this model is the
existence of the maximal acceleration for any physical processes [7, 8]. In our recent
work [9] it was shown that a similar increase of space-time dimension (through three
components of usual velocity) is required from an uniform approach to diﬀerentiation
of kinematic quantities. Namely, a derivation of one kinematic variable by other should
correspond to a turn angle in plane of these variables. This is possible only if both the
function-variable and the argument-variable are involved in the construction of vector
space. So in the special relativity theory, the velocity is in correspondence with a turn
angle, ψ, in the pseudoplane (x, t):

dx
dt

= c tanh ψ .

(1)

By analogy with constant velocity motions, accelerated motions can be considered
through correspondence between the acceleration and the turn angle in the pseudoplane
(v, t) like (1). Therefore the velocity should be added as a new freedom degree of an
expanded space-time.

We shall now present the aforesaid in more rigorous form. Let us write an interval

square used in the special relativity as

(ds)2 = −(dx1)2 − (dx2)2 − (dx3)2 + c2 (dt)2 .

Turns in the pseudoplanes (dxa, dt), where a = 1, 2, 3, preserve the interval square. The
parameters of these turns are the velocity coordinates va = dxa/dt. In our previous
work [9] the following logical scheme was proposed

(i) to supplement the diﬀerentials dxa and dt by the diﬀerentials of turn parameters

dva;

(ii) to construct a vector space on these diﬀerentials;

(iii) to introduce the interval square in the speciﬁed vector space;
(iv) to consider turns in the pseudoplanes (dva, dt).

As a result, it is possible to generalize the special relativity to motions with variable
velocity.

The geometric rotations in the planes (dx1, dx2), (dx3, dx1), (dx2, dx3) preserve also
the interval square. The parameters of these turns are angles θ2
2, respectively.
According to the above approach, a kinematic description of geometric rotations with
angular velocity must result from a relation between turns angles in the planes (dθ2
1, dt),
2, dt) and angular velocity components. Thus the geometrical angles θ2
(dθ1
1,
3, θ3
θ1

3, dt), (dθ3
2 should be included in a list of freedom degrees of space.
The present paper is aimed at applying these ideas to geometric rotations and at

constructing the kinematics for derivations of arbitrary order.

The rotation kinematics, including rules of composition of angular velocities and
transformations of kinematic variables, is considered in Section 2. A generalization

of dynamic variables (energy, impulse, force, moment) is produced in Section 3 where
a wave equation is also modiﬁed to describe rotary motion of light wave. Section 4
contains a special relativity generalization to the kinematics of arbitrary order. The
conclusions are presented in Section 5.

2. Transformations for rotating reference frames

We supplement the diﬀerentials dxa, dt by the angle diﬀerentials dθ2
construct a vector space on them. Let us introduce an interval square

fundamental time T and the fundamental length L = c T introduced in [9]. Let the
fundamental length be related to R by

where the indexes a and b numbering geometric coordinates take values 1, 2, 3. Then
the interval square can be rewritten in the dimensionless form

2.1. Θ Ω-motion of reference frame

We consider a body B in uniform rotation with respect to a frame K in the plane
(dx1, dx2) about the angle θ with the angular velocity ω. Let a frame K ′ rotate uniformly
with respect to K in the same plane about the angle θ with the angular velocity ω.
The motion of body B will be characterized by the angular velocity ω′ and the angle θ′
with respect to K ′. In this case the dimensionless interval square is simpliﬁed

(dσ)2 = −(dx1)2 − (dx2)2 + (dx4)2 + (dx2

In our case U = Θ Ω = Ω Θ and

δU U−1 = δΘ Θ−1 + δΩ Ω−1 .

Using this matrix we obtain

2.1.1. Rule of composition of angular velocities As the rotations Θ and Ω are
commutating, the rule of composition of angular velocities does not depend on turn
angle of frame. From (4) one can obtain

where ξ′ is integration constant. Let us take the relations x2

As we see, the constant Ω is a fundamental angular velocity like the light velocity in the
rule of composition of velocities. The relation for composition of angular velocities has
a singularity when

ω ω′ = Ω2 .

It is possible that the presence of this singularity has a profound physical meaning.

3. Relativistic mechanics

The necessity of the correction of relativistic mechanics stems from the fact that
the velocities va and the angles θa
b of geometrical turns are introduced as additional
coordinates being independent of geometrical coordinates and time. The angles θa
b can
be identiﬁed with particle interior freedom degrees responsible for a particle spin. Let
us construct the relativistic mechanics generalized to accelerated motions and uniform
rotations by analogy to the relativistic mechanics to be invariant with respect to uniform
velocity motions.

3.1. 10-velocity

The diﬀerentials included in the interval square

(ds)2 = c2 (dt)2 − (dx1)2 − (dx2)2 − (dx3)2

2)2 + R2 (dθ1

3)2 + R2 (dθ2

can be considered as the vector coordinates in 10-dimensional space. We have for the
contravariant coordinates

dxµ = {c dt, dx1, dx2, dx3, T dv1, T dv2, T dv3, R dθ3

2, R dθ1

3, R dθ2

and for the covariant coordinates

dxµ = {c dt, −dx1, −dx2, −dx3, −T dv1, −T dv2, −T dv3, R dθ3

2, R dθ1

3, R dθ2

The interval square is rewritten in the new coordinates as

(ds)2 = dxµ dxµ ,

(µ = 1, . . . , 10) .

and a relativistic moment

According to our concept, the relativistic moment being independent of particle motion
in geometrical space can be identiﬁed with the spin of particle.

Through quantities introduced the component of 10-impulse can be written as

The transformation of components of 10-impulse can be described by the formalism
similar to that for transformation of coordinate diﬀerentials. For example, in the case
of Θ Ω-motion of frame, the transformations (6) imply

4. Special relativity generalization to kinematics of arbitrary order

4.1. Generalized space-time

In the previous Sections was shown that if turn angles in the planes (dxi1, dxi2) are
considered as additional coordinates xi1i2 to space-time coordinates xi1, the relativistic
kinematic for accelerated and rotary motions can be produced. In the space with such
coordinates, the interval is represented by diﬀerentials dxi1, dxi1i2, and the dimensionless
interval square has the form

(dσ)2 = gi1k1 dxi1 dxk1 + gi1i2,k1k2 dxi1i2 dxk1k2 .

The complexity of the algebraic structure of space is determined by the maximal tensor
degree of additional coordinates. It will be called kinematics order. To construct the
kinematics of higher order, the above approach should be applied by a recurrence way.
In the general case, the kinematics of order n is considered in the space with
coordinates xi1i2i3i4...ik, where k = 1 . . . n. These coordinates are turn angles in the
planes (dxi1i2...im, dximim+1...ik), where m = k/2, . . . , k − 1. The space itself will be called
generalized space-time and will be denoted by XN , where N is its dimension. In the
generalized space-time, the interval square is written as

(dσ)2 = gi1k1 dxi1 dxk1 + gi1i2,k1k2 dxi1i2 dxk1k2

+ . . . + gi1i2...in,k1k2...kn dxi1i2...in dxk1k2...kn .
A collective index I taking values i1, i1i2, . . . , i1i2...in can be deﬁned as convenience. The
interval square is rewritten through the collective index in the easy-to-use form:

(dσ)2 = gIK dxI dxK .

The interval square of this kind is a particular case of generalizations made in our book
[10].

4.2. Structure equations of the generalized space-time

Let us consider a turn in the generalized space-time XN , i.e. a linear transformation

preserving the interval square (14). The turn matrix U depends on the turn angles xα
which are the coordinates of XN +1. A set of turns is group. In other words, for this set
a composition rule

||dx|| = U ||dx′||

U = U2 U1

can be introduced, an unity element can be deﬁned, and an inverse element exists for
any element from U.

Consider the variations of coordinate diﬀerentials as functions of the turn angle

variations:

δ||dx|| = δU ||dx′|| = ∆U ||dx|| ,

(14)

(15)

(16)

Turns and special relativity transformations

11

where the notation ∆U = δU U−1 was introduced. These relations will be called
structure equations of the generalized space-time (for more details, see [10]).
In the
expanded form they are written as

δdxI = ∆U(xα)I

K dxK .

In a special case the structure equations reduce to the equations (3) and the equations
(7), (12) from [9].

In the neighbourhood of the turn group unit, the structure equations take the form

where the notation

δdxI = CI

Kα δxα dxK ,

CI

Kα = ∂αUI

K

xα=0

is used. The values CI
Kα are called the structure constants. In particular, if the set of
turn angles is the same as the coordinate set of XN , the structure equations is written
as

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

δdxI = CI

KL δxL dxK .

From the composition rule (15) it follows that

δU = δU2 U1 + U2 δU1 .

If we multiply this expression on the right by U−1 = (U1)−1 (U2)−1 and substitute the
result in (16), we obtain the structure equations for the turn angles involved in the
composition rule:

δ||dx|| =

∆U2 + U2 ∆U1 (U2)−1

||dx|| .

4.3. Relation between velocity of arbitrary order and generalized space-time coordinates

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

An arbitrary motion in the generalized space-time makes itself evident in the fact that
one coordinate set depends on other coordinate set. In the simplest case, for example,
the space coordinates are functions of time: xa = xa(x4).

Consider a set of arguments, xα1, and a set of functions, xα2, in the generalized
In other words, it is proposed that functional relationships xα2(xα1)

space-time XN .
exist. The diﬀerentials of these functions can be written as

dxα2 = Vα2

β1 dxβ1 .

(17)

The quantity Vα2
β1 ≡ ∂β1xα2 will be called velocity of arbitrary order. We assume that
the remaining coordinates of XN are invariant. Then the interval is represented by the
diﬀerentials dxα2, dxα1, and the interval square has the form

(dσ)2 = gαβ dxα dxβ = gα2β2 dxα2 dxβ2 + gα1β1 dxα1 dxβ1 .

Introduce a turn in XN

dxα = Uα

β (dxβ)′ .

Turns and special relativity transformations

We shall ﬁnd a relation between velocity of arbitrary order and generalized space-time
coordinates which are turn angles in the planes (dxα, dxβ). For this purpose we consider
the variations of coordinate diﬀerentials:

δdxα = ∆Uα
β = (δU U−1)α

β dxβ ,

where ∆Uα

β. This can be rewritten in the expanded form

If we diﬀerentiate the equation (17) by the angles of turn matrix, we obtain

δdxα2 = ∆Uα2
δdxα1 = ∆Uα1

β2 dxβ2 + ∆Uα2
β2 dxβ2 + ∆Uα1

β1 dxβ1 ,
β1 dxβ1 .

δdxα2 = δVα2

β1 dxβ1 + Vα2

β1 δdxβ1 .

From this expression, (17), and (18) follows
β1 + ∆Uα2

β1 = ∆Uα2

β1 − Vα2

β2 Vβ2

δVα2

γ1 ∆Uγ1

β1 − Vα2

γ1 ∆Uγ1

β2 Vβ2

β1 .

This diﬀerential equation establishes the desired relation between velocity of arbitrary
order and generalized space-time coordinates.

In the case when turns are considered only in planes (dxα2, dxβ1),

∆Uα2

β2 = 0 , ∆Uα1

and the diﬀerential equation obtained is simpliﬁed:
β1 = ∆Uα2

The equation (4) and the equations (9), (13), (14) from [9] are the particular cases of
the last diﬀerential relation.

coordinates xα and xβ, (19) reduces to

5. Conclusions

The expansion of the space-time to the generalized space-time is the consequence of
In order to increase
uniform approach to the diﬀerentiation of kinematic variables.
in the next step of
the space dimension, the following recurrence rule is used:
generalization, additional coordinates of space-time are angles of turns in planes
involving the coordinates which were introduced in the previous step. The Minkowskian
space-time is used for starting the recurrence generalization procedure.

In context of the speciﬁed generalization, the new kinematic constants are
introduced for application. For example, the only fundamental constant such as the

velocity of light c is required in the ﬁrst step, but the two additional constants such
as the fundamental radius R and time T (or the fundamental angular velocity Ω and
acceleration A) are required in the second step.

We propose that the motion of light (as particle or wave) is subject to the condition

for the interval square in the generalized space-time

(dσ)2 = 0 .

The kinematic properties of light becomes more rich through the expansion of space-
time. In the Einsteinian special relativity, the light is in linear uniform velocity motion
with fundamental velocity c. For the second step of generalization, the light motion
includes accelerated motion and proper rotation. This sequence can be continued. It
is clear that the kinematics of higher order can describe not only motions of new kinds
but any motions represented by the kinematics of the previous order as well.

The space generalization considered is naturally linked to a wide spectrum of
theoretical conceptions like Kaluza-Klein theory where additional dimensions are
invoked to describe diﬀerent phenomena in the uniform context.

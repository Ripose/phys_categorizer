Abstract. In this paper we ﬁx our attention, on hadron structure, and show
that also the strong interaction strength αS, ordinarily called the “(perturba-
tive) coupling–constant square”, can be evaluated within our theory, and found
to decrease (increase) as the “distance” r decreases (increases). This yields
both the conﬁnement of the hadron constituents, and their asymptotic free-
dom: in qualitative agreement with the experimental evidence. In other terms,
our approach leads us, on a purely theoretical ground, to a dependence of αS
on r which had been previously found only on phenomenological and heuristic
grounds. We expect the above agreement to be also quantitative, on the basis
of a few checks performed in this work.

1. Introduction

In the past years, a uniﬁed approach to strong and gravitational interactions was
proposed ([1, 2, 4, 5]), which used the geometrical methods of general relativity;
and assumed covariance of physical laws under global discrete dilations. It yielded
results similar to those given by the “strong gravity” theory ([6, 7]).
Within such an approach, and in connection with hadron structure, we came in
particular to associate hadron constituents with suitable stationary, axisymmetric
solutions of certain new Einstein–type equations, supposed to describe the strong
ﬁeld inside hadrons. Those Einstein–type equations are nothing but the ordinary

Einstein equations (with cosmological term) suitably scaled down ([4, 5]). As a
consequence, the cosmological constant Λ and the gravitation universal constant G
(or the masses M ) result, in our theory, to be scaled up and transformed into a
“hadronic constant” λ and into a “strong universal constant” N (or into “strong
masses” g), respectively ([1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9]). Our ﬁeld equations, to be valid inside a
hadron, are therefore:

Schwarzschild–de Sitter’s, corresponding to the metric generated by a central, static,
spherically–symmetric distribution of strong charge; i.e., to the metric generated by
a hadron constituent (say, a quark) when neglecting its electric charge and intrinsic

where go is the strong charge of the considered constituent, and (t, r, θ, ϕ) are spher-

units, go is equal to the rest–mass Mo of the hadron constituent.

2. Strong–charge and its dependence on r

Now, we consider the geodesic motion of a test–particle in the metric (2). Our
test particle, when free–falling, will be endowed ([1]) with a constant total–energy

Since the Schwarzschild–type coordinates do not correspond to any physical ob-
server, let us pass —however— to the local coordinates (T, R, θ, ϕ), associated with
observers at rest w.r.t.

strength of the interaction between two (strongly interacting) quarks is equal to
the strength of the interaction between two (gravitationally interacting) particles
endowed with the Planck mass.
In whatever units, Eqs.(4)-(5) tell us that the
strong charge g′ of the test–particle does change with its speed V , w.r.t. the local
observers, as follows:

that is the strong charge (or strong mass) of a particle does depend, inside a hadron,
on the particle speed exactly as the ordinary gravitational mass does in our space-
time.
Notice that Eqs. (7)-(8) allow us to express the value of the strong charge g′ as a
function, e.g., of its radial coordinate r relative to the source–quark. Namely, in
the case of Eq. (7) one has

3. The strong coupling constant

Similarly with the electromagnetic case, in which αE = (ke2)/(¯hc), the strong
interaction strength is deﬁned ([1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9]) as

corresponds to the dimensionless square of the vertex coupling–constant. Let us
recall that g′ is measured by the local observer. From Eqs.(9) we obtain

Therefore, the strong interaction strength αS, which in elementary particle physics
is ordinarily called the “(perturbative) coupling–constant square”, is predicted by
our approach to decrease (increase) as the “distance” r decreases (increases). This
yields both the conﬁnement of the constituents (for values of r
1 fm), and their
so–called asymptotic freedom:
in qualitative agreement with the experimental ev-
idence. In other words, our approach leads us —on purely theoretical grounds—
to a dependence of αS on r which was previously found, within the perturbative
QCD[8], only on phenomenological and heuristic grounds.

4. Conclusion

We have seen that the strong interaction strength, αS, ordinarily called the “(pertur-
bative) coupling–constant square”, can be evaluated within our theory, and found
to decrease (increase) as the “distance” r decreases (increases). This yielded the
conﬁnement of the constituents (for large values of r), as well as their asymptotic
freedom (for small values of r inside the hadron): in qualitative agreement with the
experimental evidence. In other words our approach led us, on a purely theoretical
ground, to a dependence of αS on r which had previously been found only on phe-
nomenological and heuristic grounds.

c mesons and baryons with the sum of the energies contained in the fre-
quencies of standing electromagnetic waves in a cubic black body. Only neutrinos
are needed to explain the mass of the π± mesons with the sum of the energies
of standing oscillations of muon and electron neutrinos in a cubic lattice plus the
energies contained in the rest masses of the neutrinos. Neutrinos and photons are
needed to explain the masses of the K-mesons, the neutron and the D-mesons. Sur-
prisingly the mass of the µ± mesons can also be explained without an additional
assumption by the oscillation energies and rest masses of a neutrino lattice. From
the diﬀerence of the masses of the π± mesons and µ± mesons we ﬁnd that the rest
mass of the muon neutrino is 47.5 milli-eV/c2. From the diﬀerence of the masses
of the neutron and proton we ﬁnd that the rest mass of the electron neutrino is
0.55 meV/c2. The potential of the weak force between the lattice points can be
determined from Born’s lattice theory. From the weak force between the lattice
points follows automatically the existence of a strong force between the sides of
two lattices. The strong nuclear force is the sum of the unsaturated weak forces at
the sides of each lattice and is therefore about 106 times stronger than the weak
force.

Introduction

A theory giving an equation whose eigenvalues would determine the masses
of the elementary particles has sofar not been found. The so-called “Stan-
dard Model” of the particles has, until now, not come up with a precise
determination of the masses of either the mesons and baryons or of the lep-
tons, which means that neither the mass of the fundamental electron nor the

1

mass of the fundamental proton have been explained. This is so although
the quarks, the foundation of the standard model, have been introduced by
Gel-Mann [1] nearly forty years ago. The diﬃculties explaining the masses
of the mesons and baryons with the standard model seem to be related to
the uncertainty of the masses of the quarks for which values are considered
ranging from zero rest mass to values from 2 to 8 MeV for e.g. the u-quark,
according to the Particle Physics Summary [2], to values on the order of
100 MeV. Suppose one has agreed on deﬁnite values of the masses of the
various quarks then one stands before the same problem one has faced with
the conventional elementary particles, namely one has to explain why the
quarks have their particular masses and what they are made of. The other
most frequently referred to theory dealing with the elementary particles, the
“String Theory” introduced by Witten [3] about twenty years ago, or its suc-
cessor the superstring theory, have despite their mathematical elegance not
led to experimentally veriﬁable results. There are very many other attempts
to explain the elementary particles or only one of the particles, too many to
list them here. It appears that there is room for another attempt to explain
the masses of the elementary particles.

1 The spectrum of the masses of the particles

As we have done before [4] we will focus attention on the so-called “stable”
mesons and baryons whose masses are reproduced with other data in Tables
1 and 4. It is obvious that any attempt to explain the masses of the mesons
and baryons should begin with the particles that are aﬀected by the fewest
parameters. These are certainly the particles without isospin (I = 0) and
without spin (J = 0), but also with strangeness S = 0, and charm C = 0.
Looking at the particles with I,J,S,C = 0 it is startling to ﬁnd that their
masses are quite close to integer multiples of the mass of the π0 meson. It
4m(π0), and the mass of the resonance η′ is
is m(η) = (1.0140
·
m(η′) = (1.0137
7m(π0). We also note that the average mass
·
ratios [m(η)/m(π0) + m(η)/m(π±)]/2 = 3.9892 = 0.9973
4 and [m(η′)/m(π0)
+ m(η′)/m(π±)]/2 = 6.9791 = 0.9970
7 are good approximations to the
integers 4 and 7. Three particles seem hardly to be suﬃcient to establish a
8m(π0)
rule. However, if we look a little further we ﬁnd that m(Λ) = 1.0332
2m(η). We note that the Λ particle has spin 1/2, not
or m(Λ) = 1.0190
spin 0 as the π0, η mesons. Nevertheless, the mass of Λ is close to 8m(π0).

Now we have enough material to formulate the integer multiple rule, ac-
cording to which the masses of the η, Λ, Σ0, Ξ0, Ω−, Λ+
c par-
ticles are, in a ﬁrst approximation, integer multiples of the mass of the π0
meson, although some of the particles have spin, and may also have charge
as well as strangeness and charm. A consequence of the integer multiple
rule must be that the ratio of the mass of any meson or baryon listed above
divided by the mass of another meson or baryon listed above is equal to
the ratio of two integer numbers. And indeed, for example m(η)/m(π0) is
2) the ratio m(Λ)/m(η). There is also
practically two times (exactly 0.9950
the ratio m(Ω−)/m(Λ) = 0.9993
3/2. We have furthermore e.g. the ratios
m(Λ)/m(η) = 1.019
2,
m(Σ0

c)/m(Σ0) = 1.0281
We will call, for reasons to be explained later, the particles discussed
above, which follow in a ﬁrst approximation the integer multiple rule, the
γ-branch of the particle spectrum. The mass ratios of these particles are in
Table 1. The deviation of the mass ratios from exact integer multiples of
m(π0) is at most 3.3%, the average of the factors before the integer multiples
of m(π0) of the nine γ-branch particles in Table 1 is 1.0066
0.0184. From
a least square analysis follows that the masses of the ten particles on Table
1 lie on a straight line given by the formula

The integer multiple rule applies to more than just the stable mesons
and baryons. The integer multiple rule applies also to the γ-branch baryon
resonances which are listed in Table 2 and the meson resonances in Table 3.
The Ω− particle has been omitted from Table 2 because it has spin 3/2, and
the Λ(1810) resonance has also been omitted because it diﬀers from Λ(1800)
only in parity, as have been two Ξ resonances whose spin is uncertain. A
least square analysis of the masses in Table 2 yields the formula

The line through the points is shown in Fig. 1 which tells that 22 particles of
the γ-branch of diﬀerent spin and isospin, strangeness and charm; eight I,J
= 0,0 mesons, thirteen J = 1/2 baryons and the π0 meson with I,J = 1,0,
lie on a straight line with slope 1.0056. In other words they approximate the
integer multiple rule very well.

→

Searching for what else the π0, η, Λ, Σ0, Ξ0, Ω− particles have in common,
we ﬁnd that the principal decays (decays with a fraction > 1%) of these
particles, as listed in Table 1, involve primarily γ-rays, the characteristic
case is π0
γγ (98.8%). We will later on discuss a possible explanation for
the 1.198% of the decays of π0 which do not follow the γγ route. After the
γ-rays the next most frequent decay product of the heavier particles of the
γ-branch are π0 mesons which again decay into γγ. To describe the decays
in another way, the principal decays of the particles listed above take place
always without the emission of neutrinos ; see Table 1. There the decays and
the fractions of the principal decay modes are given, taken from the Particle
Physics Summary. We cannot consider decays with fractions < 1%. We will

6

refer to the particles whose masses are approximately integer multiples of the
mass of the π0 meson, and which decay without the emission of neutrinos,
as the γ-branch of the particle spectrum.

To summarize the facts concerning the γ-branch. Within 0.66% on the
average the masses of the particles of the γ-branch are integer multiples
(namely 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and even 17, 18, 20) of the mass of the π0 meson. It
is improbable that nine particles have masses so close to integer multiples
of m(π0) if there is no correlation between them and the π0 meson. It has,
on the other hand, been argued that the integer multiple rule is a numerical
coincidence. But the probability that the mass ratios of the γ-branch fall
by coincidence on integer numbers between 1 and 20 instead on all possible
numbers between 1 and 20 with two decimals after the period is smaller than
10−20, i.e nonexistent. The integer multiple rule is not aﬀected by more than
3% by the spin, the isospin, the strangeness, and by charm. The integer
multiple rule seems even to apply to the Ω− and Λ+
c particles, although they
are charged. In order for the integer multiple rule to be valid the deviation
of the ratio m/m(π0) from an integer number must be smaller than 1/2N,
where N is the integer number closest to the actual ratio m/m(π0). That
means that the permissible deviation decreases rapidly with increased N. All
particles of the γ-branch have deviations smaller than 1/2N.

The remainder of the stable mesons and baryons are the π±, K±,0, p, n,
S particles which make up the ν-branch of the particle spectrum.

D±,0, and D±
The ratios of the masses are given in Table 4.

These particles are in general charged, exempting the K0 and D0 mesons
and the neutron n, in contrast to the particles of the γ-branch, which are
in general neutral.
It does not make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence whether one
considers the mass of a particular charged or neutral particle. After the π
mesons, the largest mass diﬀerence between charged and neutral particles is
that of the K mesons (0.81%), and thereafter all mass diﬀerences between
charged and neutral particles are < 0.5%. The integer multiple rule does
not immediately apply to the masses of the ν-branch particles if m(π±) (or
m(π0)) is used as reference, because m(K±) = 0.8843
4 =
3.537 is far from integer. Since the masses of the π0 meson and the π± mesons
diﬀer by only 3.4% it has been argued that the π± mesons are, but for the
isospin, the same particles as the π0 meson, and that therefore the π± cannot
start another particle branch. However, this argument is not supported by
the completely diﬀerent decays of the π0 mesons and the π± mesons. The
π0 meson decays almost exclusively into γγ (98.8%), whereas the π± mesons

If we make the π± mesons the reference particles of the ν-branch, then
we must multiply the mass ratios m/m(π±) of the above listed particles with
an average factor 0.848
0.025, as follows from the mass ratios on Table 4.
The integer multiple rule may, however, apply directly if one makes m(K±)
the reference for masses larger than m(K±). The mass of the neutron is
2m(K±), which is only a fair approximation to an integer multi-
0.9516
ple. There are, on the other hand, outright integer multiples in m(D±) =
4m(K±). A least square

with r2 = 0.998. This means that the particles of the ν-branch are integer
multiples of m(π±) times the factor 0.853. One must, however, consider
that the π± mesons are not necessarily the perfect reference for all ν-branch
particles, because π± has I = 1, whereas for example K± has I = 1/2 and S
=
1 and the neutron has also I = 1/2. Actually the factor 0.853 is only an
average. The mass ratios indicate that the factor before m/m(π±) decreases
slowly with increased N. The existence of the factor and its decrease will be
explained later.

Contrary to the particles of the γ-branch, the ν-branch particles decay
preferentially with the emission of neutrinos, the foremost example is, e.g.,
π+
µ+ + νµ with a fraction of 99.988%. Neutrinos characterize the weak
interaction. We will refer to the particles in Table 4 as the neutrino branch
(ν-branch) of the particle spectrum. We emphasize that a weak decay of the
particles of the ν-branch is by no means guaranteed. Although the neutron

decays via n
π+π−π+ (5.59%), but the subsequent

decays of the π± mesons lead to neutrinos and e±. The decays of the particles
in the ν-branch follow a mixed rule, either weak or electromagnetic.

To summarize the facts concerning the ν-branch of the mesons and bary-
ons. The masses of these particles seem to follow the integer multiple rule if
one uses the π± meson as reference, however the mass ratios share a common

To summarize what we have learned about the integer multiple rule: In
spite of diﬀerences in charge, spin, strangeness, and charm the masses of the
mesons and baryons of the γ-branch are integer multiples of the mass of the π0
meson within at most 3.3% and on the average within 0.66%. Correspond-
ingly, the masses of the particles of the ν-branch are, after multiplication
0.025, integer multiples of the mass of the π± mesons.
with a factor 0.85
The validity of the integer multiple rule can easily be veriﬁed with a calcu-
lator from the data in the Particle Physics Summary. The integer multiple
rule suggests that the particles are the result of superpositions of modes and
higher modes of a wave equation.

2 Standing waves in a cubic lattice and the

particles of the γ-branch

In an earlier article [5] we have tried to explain the masses of the elementary
particles by monochromatic eigenfrequencies of standing waves in an elastic
cube. The explanation of the particles by monochromatic eigenfrequencies
does not seem to be tenable because a monochromatic frequency does not ac-
commodate the multitude of frequencies created in a high energy collision of
10−23 sec duration. We will now study, as we have done in [6], whether the so-
called stable particles of the γ-branch cannot be described by the frequency
spectrum of standing waves in a cubic lattice, which can accommodate auto-
matically the Fourier frequency spectrum of an extreme short-time collision.
The investigation of the consequences of lattices for particle theory was ini-
tiated by Wilson [7] who studied a fermion lattice. This study has developed
over time into lattice QCD. The results of such endeavors have culminated
in the paper of Weingarten [8] and his colleagues which required elaborate
year long numerical calculations. They determined the masses of seven par-
ticles (K∗,p,φ,∆,Σ,Ξ,Ω), with an uncertainty of up to
8%, agreeing with
the observed masses within a few percent, up to 6%. Our theory covers all
particles of the γ-branch, namely the π0, η, Λ, Σ0, Ξ0, Ω−, Λ+
c and Ω0
c
particles and agrees on the average with the measured masses within 0.66%,
and covers also the particles of the ν-branch, as we will see later.

It will be necessary to outline the most elementary aspects of the the-
ory of lattice oscillations since we will, in the following, investigate whether
the masses of the γ-branch particles can be explained with the help of the

10

frequency spectra of standing waves in a cubic lattice. The classic paper
describing lattice oscillations is from Born and v.Karman [9], henceforth re-
ferred to as B&K. They looked at ﬁrst at the oscillations of a one-dimensional
chain of points with mass m, separated by a constant distance a. This is the
monatomic case, all lattice points have the same mass. B&K assume that
the forces exerted on each point of the chain originate only from the two
neighboring points. These forces are opposed to and proportional to the
displacements, as with elastic springs. The equation of motion is in this case

m¨un = α(un+1 −

un)

α(un −

−

un−1) .

The un are the displacements of the mass points from their equilibrium posi-
tion which are apart by the distance a. The dots signify, as usual, diﬀerenti-
ation with respect to time, α is a constant characterizing the force between
the lattice points, and n is an integer number.

In order to solve (6) B&K set

un = Aei(ω t + nφ) ,

t the displacements are zero, as with standing waves. If a displacement is
repeated after n points we have na = λ, where λ is the wavelength, a the
lattice constant, and it must be nφ = 2π according to (7). It follows that

λ = 2πa/φ .

B&K point out that there is not only a continuum of frequencies, but also
a maximal frequency which is reached when φ = π, or at the minimum of
the possible wavelengths λ = 2a. B&K then discuss the three-dimensional
lattice, with lattice constant a and masses m. They reduce the complexities
of the problem by considering only the 18 points nearest to any point. These
are 6 points at distance a, and 12 points at distance a√2. B&K assume that
the forces between the points are linear functions of the small displacements,

dimensional lattice. In the three-dimensional case we deal with the forces
caused by the 6 points at the distance a which are characterized by the
constant α in the case of central forces. There are also the forces which
originate from the 12 points at distance a√2, characterized by the constant
γ, which we do not need. We investigate the propagation of plane waves in

[14].

3 The masses of the particles of the γ-branch

We will now assume, as seems to be quite natural, that the particles of
the γ-branch consist of the same particles into which they decay, directly or
ultimately. That means that the γ-branch particles consist of photons. We
base this assumption on the fact that photons and π0 mesons are the principal
mode of decay of the γ-branch particles, the characteristic example is π0
γγ
(98.8%). Table 1 shows that there are decays of the γ-branch particles which
lead to particles of the ν-branch, in particular to pairs of π+ and π− mesons,

particles. Pair production is evident in the decay π0
It requires the presence of electromagnetic waves of high energy. Anyway,
the explanation of the γ-branch particles must begin with the explanation
of the most simple example of its kind, the π0 meson, which by all means
seems to consist of photons. The composition of the particles of the γ-branch
suggested here oﬀers a direct route from the formation of a γ-branch particle,
through its lifetime, to its decay products. Particles that are made of photons
are necessarily neutral, as the majority of the particles of the γ-branch are.
We also base our assumption that the particles of the γ-branch are made
of photons on the circumstances of the formation of the γ-branch particles.
The most simple and straightforward creation of a γ-branch particle are
π0 + p, or in the case that the spins of γ and p
the reactions γ + p
π0 + p + γ′. A photon impinges on a proton and
are parallel γ + p
creates a π0 meson. In a timespan on the order of 10−23 sec the pulse of the
incoming electromagnetic wave is, according to Fourier analysis, converted
into a continuum of electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from
1023 sec−1 to ν
. The wave packet so created decays, according to
10−17 sec into two electromagnetic waves or γ-rays. It
experience, after 8.4
seems to be very unlikely that Fourier analysis does not hold for the case of
an electromagnetic wave impinging on a proton. The question then arises of
what happens to the electromagnetic waves in the timespan of 10−16 seconds
between the creation of the wave packet and its decay into two γ-rays? We
will investigate whether the electromagnetic waves cannot continue to exist
for the 10−16 seconds until the wave packet decays.

·

There must be a mechanism which holds the wave packet of the newly
created particle together, or else it will disperse. We assume that the very
many photons in the new particle are held together in a cubic lattice. Ordi-
nary cubic lattices, such as the NaCl lattice, are held together by attractive
forces between particles of opposite polarity. We assume that the photon
lattice is held together by weak attractive forces between photons, if they
are about 10−16 cm apart. Electrodynamics does not predict the existence
of such a force between two photons. However, electroweak theory says that
g2 on the scale of 10−16 cm, and we will now assume that there is such
e2
a weak force in the photon lattice. The potential of this force is given in sec-
tion 8, Eq.(45). It is not unprecedented that photons have been considered
to be building blocks of the elementary particles. Schwinger [15] has once

≈

13

∼

studied an exact one-dimensional quantum electrodynamical model in which
the photon acquired a mass

e2.

We will now investigate the standing waves of a cubic photon lattice.
We assume that the lattice is held together by a weak force acting from one
lattice point to the next. We assume that the range of this force is 10−16
cm, because the range of the weak nuclear force is on the order of 10−16
cm, according to [16]. For the sake of simplicity we set the sidelength of
the lattice at 10−13 cm, the exact size of the nucleon is given in [17] and
will be used later. With a = 10−16 cm there are then 109 lattice points.
As we will see the ratios of the masses of the particles are independent of
the sidelength of the lattice. Because it is the most simple case, we assume
that a central force acts between the lattice points. We cannot consider spin,
isospin, strangeness or charm of the particles. The frequency equation for
the oscillations of an isotropic monatomic cubic lattice with central forces is
either given by equation (9), or in the two-dimensional case by

is the classical Cauchy relation. Isotropy requires that c44 = (c11 −
Eq.(12) follows directly from the equation of motion for the displacements in
a monatomic lattice, which are given e.g. by Blackman [10]. The minus sign
in front of cosφ1 in (12) means that the waves are longitudinal. Transverse
waves in a cubic lattice with concentric forces are not possible according to
[14]. All frequencies that solve (12) come with either a plus or a minus sign
which is, as we will see, important.

The frequency distribution following from (12) is shown in Fig. 2.

There are some easily veriﬁable frequencies. For example at φ1, φ2 = 0,0

or as we will see, using Eq.(16), ν0 = c⋆/2πa.

considered. The group velocity is given by

The group velocity in the photon lattice has to be equal to the velocity of

with the velocity of light.
In order to learn how this requirement aﬀects
α/M in a photon
the frequency distribution we have to know the value of
lattice. But we do not have information about what either α or M might be
in this case. We assume in the following that a
α/M = c⋆, which means,

the equation for the group velocity is

df /dφ .

(16)

(17)

For a photon lattice that means, since cg must then always be equal to
c⋆, that df/dφ = 1. This requirement determines the form of the frequency
distribution, whether we deal with an axial oscillation as in Eq.(9) or the
two-dimensional oscillation of Eq.(12), regardless of the order of the mode of
oscillation. The frequencies of the corrected spectrum must increase from ν
= 0 at the origin φ1, φ2 = 0,0 with slope 1 (in units of ν0) until a maximum
is reached, from where the frequency must decrease with slope 1 to ν = 0.
The frequency distribution corrected for (17), i.e. with df /dφ = 1, is shown
in Fig. 3. The corrected frequency distributions of higher modes are of the
same type, but for the area they cover, see e.g. Fig. 4.

The second mode (i1, i2 = 2) covers 4 times the area of the basic mode,
because 2φ ranges from 0 to 2π, (for φ > 0), whereas the basic mode ranges
from 0 to π. Consequently the energy (Eq.18) contained in all frequencies
of the second mode is four times larger than the energy of the basic mode,
because the energy contained in the lattice oscillations must be proportional
to the sum of all frequencies. Adding, by superposition, to the second mode
diﬀerent numbers of basic modes or of second modes will give exact integer
multiples of the energy of the basic mode. Now we understand the integer
multiple rule of the particles of the γ-branch. There is, in the framework
of this theory, on account of Eq.(17), no alternative but integer multiples of
the basic mode for the energy contained in the frequencies of the diﬀerent
modes or for superpositions of diﬀerent modes. In other words, the masses
of the diﬀerent particles are integer multiples of the mass of the π0 meson,
assuming that there is no spin, isospin, strangeness or charm.

We remember that the measured masses in Table 1, which incorporate
diﬀerent spins, isospins, strangeness, and charm spell out the integer mul-
tiple rule within on the average 0.66% accuracy.
It is worth noting that
there is no free parameter if one takes the ratio of the energies contained in
α/M
the frequency distributions of the diﬀerent modes, because the factor

in Eqs.(9,12) cancels. This means, in particular, that the ratios of the fre-
quency distributions, or the mass ratios, are independent of the mass of the
photons at the lattice points, as well as of the magnitude of the force between
the lattice points.

It is obvious that the integer multiples of the frequencies are only a ﬁrst
approximation of the theory of lattice oscillations and of the mass ratios of
the particles. The equation of motion in the lattice (6) does not apply in
the eight corners of the cube, nor does it apply to the twelve edges, nor, in
particular, to the six sides of the cube. A cube with 109 lattice points is
not correctly described by the periodic boundary condition we have used,
but is what is referred to as a microcrystal. A phenomenological theory of
the frequency distributions in microcrystals, considering in particular surface
waves, can be found in Chapter 6 of Ghatak and Kothari [14]. Surface waves

17

may account for the small deviations of the mass ratios of the mesons and
baryons from the integer multiple rule of the oscillations in a cube. However,
it seems to be futile to pursue a more accurate determination of the oscillation
frequencies as long as one does not know what the structure of the electron is,
whose mass is 0.378% of the mass of the π0 meson and hence is a substantial
part of the deviation of the mass ratios from the integer multiple rule.

Let us summarize our ﬁndings concerning the particles of the γ-branch.
The π0 meson is the basic mode of the photon lattice oscillations. The η
meson corresponds to the ﬁrst higher mode (i1, i2 = 2), as is suggested by
4m(π0). The Λ particle corresponds to the superposition of two
m(η)
2m(η). This superpo-
higher modes (i1, i2 = 2), as is suggested by m(Λ)
sition apparently results in the creation of spin 1/2. The two modes would
then have to be coupled. The Σ0 and Ξ0 baryons are superpositions of one
or two basic modes on the Λ particle. The Ω− particle corresponds to the
superposition of three coupled higher modes (i1, i2 = 2) as is suggested by
m(Ω−)
3m(η). This procedure apparently causes spin 3/2. The charmed
Λ+
c is
apparently the superposition of a basic mode on Λ+
c , as is suggested by the
c. The easiest explanation of Ξ0
decay of Σ0
c is that it is the superposition of
two coupled (3.3) modes. The superposition of two modes of the same type
is, as in the case of Λ, accompanied by spin 1/2. The Ω0
c baryon is appar-
ently the superposition of two basic modes on the Ξ0
c particle. All neutral
particles of the γ-branch are thus accounted for. We ﬁnd it interesting that
(2.2) modes, or the Ω− particle with
all γ-branch particles with coupled 2
(2.2) mode, have strangeness. But this rule does not hold in
the coupled 3
the presence of a (3.3) mode. All γ-branch particles with a (3.3) mode have
charm. The modes of the particles are listed in Table 1.

c particle seems to be the ﬁrst particle incorporating a (3.3) mode. Σ0

We have also found the γ-branch antiparticles, which follow from the neg-
ative frequencies which solve Eqs.(9) or (12). Antiparticles have always been
associated with negative energies. Following Dirac’s argument for electrons
and positrons, we associate the masses with the negative frequency distribu-
tions with antiparticles. We emphasize that the existence of antiparticles is
an automatic consequence of our theory.

All particles of the γ-branch are unstable with lifetimes on the order of
10−10 sec or shorter. Born [18] has shown that the oscillations in cubic lattices
held together by central forces are unstable. It also seems to be possible to
e−+e++γ (1.198%). Since in our
understand the decay of the π0 meson π0
model the π0 meson consists of a multitude of electromagnetic waves, some

of them with energies larger than 2m(e±)c2
⋆, it seems that pair production
takes place within the π0 meson, and even more so in the higher modes of
the γ-branch where the electrons and positrons created by pair production
π+ + π− + π0 (23.2%) or in the decay
tend to settle on mesons, as e.g. in η
π+ + π− + γ (4.78%), where the origin of the pair of charges is more

apparent.

→

Finally we must explain the reason for which the photon lattice or the
γ-branch particles are limited in size to a particular value, as the experiments
tell. Conventional lattice theory using the periodic boundary condition does
not limit the size of a crystal, and in fact very large crystals exist. If, however,
the lattice consists of standing electromagnetic waves the size of the lattice is
limited by the radiation pressure. The lattice will necessarily break up at the
latest when the outward directed radiation pressure is equal to the inward
directed elastic force which holds the lattice together, in technical terms
when the radiation pressure is equal to Young’s modulus of the crystal. The
radiation pressure can be calculated and is a function of the sidelength of the
lattice. Young’s modulus of the lattice can be calculated from lattice theory.
From the equality of both follows, as shown in [19], that the sidelength of
the photon lattice or of the π0 meson must be on the order of 10−13 cm or
about the size of the nucleon, the principal uncertainty being the breaking
strength of lattices, for which a satisfactory solution is not known.

4 The mass of the π0 meson

So far we have studied the ratios of the masses of the particles. We will now
determine the mass of the π0 meson in order to validate that the mass ratios
link with the actual masses of the particles. The energy of the π0 meson is

For the sum of the energies of all frequencies of the lattice we use the equation

This equation originates from B&K. N is the number of all lattice points.
The total energy of the frequencies in a cubic lattice is equal to the number of

cubic lattice is

The radius of the π± mesons has also been measured [20] and after further
10−13 cm, which means that within the
analysis [21] was found to be 0.83
uncertainty of the radii we have rp = rπ.

·

If the oscillations are parallel to an axis, the limitation of the group
velocity is taken into account, that means if ν = ν0φ, and the absolute values
of the frequencies are taken, then the value of the double integral in Eq.(18)
is 2π3 = 62.01. If we use for f(φ1, φ2) the modiﬁed frequency distribution
shown in Fig. 3 with the absolute values of the frequencies then it turns out
that the numerical value of the double integral in Eq.(18) is 66.9 (radians2)
109 and ν0 = c⋆/2πa it follows
for the corrected (1.1) state. With N = 2.854

the basic frequency of the Fourier spectrum after a collision on the order of
10−23 sec duration is 1023 sec−1, which means, when E = hν, that one basic
frequency alone contains an energy of about 9m(π0)c2

the complete quantum mechanical energy of a linear oscillator as given by
Planck

This equation was already used by B&K for the determination of the speciﬁc
heat of cubic crystals or solids. Equation (19) calls into question the value of
the temperature T in the interior of a particle. We determine T empirically

10−4 erg = 67.82 MeV in the case of the corrected Eq.(9) and
is 1.0866
10−4 erg in the case of the corrected Eq.(12). That means that the
1.172
sum of the energies of the oscillations parallel to an axis is 0.502E(m(π0)),
and for the two-dimensional oscillations the sum of the energies in the cor-
rected frequencies is 0.542E(m(π0)). We have to double this amount because
standing waves consist of two waves traveling in opposite direction with the
same absolute value of the frequency. The sum of the energy of the lattice
oscillations in the π0 meson is therefore

in the case that the oscillations are parallel to the φ1 axis, or 2.345
·
1.084E(m(π0)) in the case of the two-dimensional oscillations Eq.(12). The
energy in the mass of the π0 meson and the energy in the sum of the lattice
oscillations agree fairly well, considering the uncertainties of the parameters
involved. The energy contained in the axial oscillations (Eq.9) matches the
measured energy in the π0 meson much better than the energy contained
in the two-dimensional oscillations (Eq.12). The calculations therefore favor
the interpretation that the oscillations in the π0 mesons are purely axial.

To summarize: We ﬁnd that the energy in the rest mass of the π0 meson
and the other particles of the γ-branch are correctly given by the sum of the
energy of the standing electromagnetic waves, if the energy of the oscillations
is determined by Planck’s formula for the energy of a linear oscillator. The
π0 meson is like an adiabatic, cubic black body ﬁlled with standing elec-
tromagnetic waves. We know from Bose’s work [24] that Planck’s formula
applies to a photon gas as well. For all γ-branch particles we have found a
simple mode of standing waves in a cubic lattice. For the explanation of the
mesons and baryons of the γ-branch we use only photons, nothing else. A
rather conservative explanation of the π0 meson, and the γ-branch particles.
It is worth noting that in the γ-branch of our model there is a continuous

21

line leading from the creation of a particle out of photons or electromagnetic
waves through the lifetime of the particle as standing electromagnetic waves
to the decay products which are electromagnetic waves as well.

From the frequency distributions of the standing waves in the lattice
follow the ratios of the masses of the particles which obey the integer multiple
rule. It is important to note that in this theory the ratios of the masses of
the γ-branch particles to the mass of the π0 meson do not depend on the
sidelength of the lattice, and the distance between the lattice points, neither
do they depend on the strength of the force between the lattice points nor
on the mass of the lattice points. The mass ratios are determined only by
the spectra of the frequencies of the standing waves in the lattice. Since
the equation determining the frequency of the standing waves is quadratic it
follows automatically that for each positive frequency there is also a negative
frequency of the same absolute value, that means that for each particle there
exists also an antiparticle.

5 The neutrino branch particles

±

The masses of the neutrino branch, the π±, K±,0, n, D±,0 and D±
S particles, are
integer multiples of the mass of the π± mesons times a factor 0.85
0.02 as
we stated before. We have explained the integer multiple rule of the γ-branch
particles with diﬀerent modes and superpositions of standing electromagnetic
waves in a cubic nuclear lattice. For the explanation of the particles of the
neutrino branch we follow a similar path. As we have done in [25] we assume,
as appears to be quite natural, that the π± mesons and the other particles of
the ν-branch consist of the same particles into which they decay, that means
of neutrinos and electrons or positrons. Since the particles of the ν-branch
decay through weak decays, we assume, as appears likewise to be natural,
that the weak nuclear force holds the particles of the ν-branch together. Since
the range of the weak interaction is only about a thousandth of the diameter
of the particles, the weak force can hold particles together only if the particles
have a lattice structure, just as macroscopic crystals are held together by
microscopic forces between atoms. We will, therefore, investigate the energy
which is contained in the oscillations of a cubic lattice consisting of electron
and muon neutrinos and in the rest masses of the neutrinos.

Since we will investigate the oscillations of a cubic lattice consisting of
muon and electron neutrinos it is necessary to outline the basic aspects of

22

diatomic lattice oscillations. In diatomic lattices the lattice points have alter-
nately the masses m and M. The classic example of a diatomic lattice is the
salt crystal with the masses of the Na and Cl atoms in the lattice points. The
theory of diatomic lattice oscillations was developed by Born and v.Karman
[9]. They ﬁrst discussed a diatomic chain. The equation of motions in the
chain are according to Eq.(22) of B&K

(21)

(22)

(23)

m¨u2n = α(u2n+1 + u2n−1 −

2u2n) ,

M ¨u2n+1 = α(u2n+2 + u2n −

2u2n+1) ,

where the un are the displacements, n an integer number and α a constant
characterizing the force between the particles. As with any spring the restor-
ing forces in (21,22) increase with increasing distance between the particles.
Eqs.(21,22) are solved with

u2n = Aei(ω t + 2nφ),

u2n+1 = Bei(ω t + (2n+1)φ) ,
(24)
where A and B are constants and φ is given by φ = 2πa/λ as in (8). a is
the lattice constant as before and λ the wavelength, λ = na. The solutions

6 The masses of the ν-branch particles

The particles of the neutrino branch decay primarily by weak decays, see
Table 4. The characteristic case are the π± mesons which decay via e.g.

µ mesons, which decay into neutrinos, and neutrinos result from the decay
of the π± mesons, but for e± which conserve charge. If the particles consist
of the particles into which they decay, then the π± mesons and the other
particles of the neutrino branch are made of neutrinos and e±. The neutrinos
must be held together in some form, otherwise the particles could not exist
over a ﬁnite lifetime, say 10−10 sec. Since neutrinos interact through the
weak force which has a range of 10−16 cm according to p.25 of [16], and since
the size of the nucleon is on the order of 10−13 cm, we suggest that the ν-
branch particles are held together in a cubic lattice. A cubic lattice is held
together by central forces, which are the most simple forces to consider. It
is not known with certainty that neutrinos actually have a rest mass as was
originally suggested by Bethe [27] and Bahcall [28] and what the values of
m(νe) and m(νµ) are. However, the results of the Super-Kamiokande [29] and
the Sudbury [30] experiments indicate that the neutrinos have rest masses.
The neutrino lattice must be diatomic, meaning that the lattice points have
alternately larger (m(νµ)) and smaller (m(νe)) masses. We will retain the
traditional term diatomic. The lattice we consider is shown in Fig. 5. Since
the neutrinos have spin 1/2 this is a four-Fermion lattice as is required for
Fermi’s explanation of the β-decay. The ﬁrst investigation of cubic Fermion
lattices in context with the elementary particles was made by Wilson [7].
The entire neutrino lattice is electrically neutral. Since we do not know the
structure of the electron we cannot consider lattices with a charge.

A neutrino lattice takes care of the continuum of frequencies which must,
according to Fourier analysis, be present after the high energy collision which
created the particle. We will, for the sake of simplicity, ﬁrst set the sidelength
of the lattice at 10−13 cm that means approximately equal to the size of
the nucleon. The lattice then contains 109 lattice points, since the lattice
constant a is on the order of 10−16 cm. The sidelength of the lattice does not
enter the equations, e.g. Eq.(25), for the frequencies of the lattice oscillations.
The calculation of the ratios of the masses or of the energy of the lattice
oscillations is consequently independent of the size of the lattice, as was the
case with the γ-branch. However the size of the lattice can be explained with
the pressure which the lattice oscillations exert on a crossection of the lattice.
The pressure cannot exceed Young’s modulus of the lattice. We require that
the lattice is isotropic.

From the frequency distribution of the axial diatomic oscillations (Eq. 25),
shown in Fig. 6, follows the group velocity dω/dk = 2πa dν/dφ at each point

neutrinos the group velocity must be smaller than c⋆, so the value of df/dφ
is limited to < 1, but cg ∼= c⋆, which is a necessity because the neutrinos in
the lattice soon approach the velocity of light as we will see. Equation (28)
applies regardless whether we consider ν+ or ν− in Eq.(25). That means that
there are no separate transverse oscillations with their theoretically higher
frequencies.

(Eq.35). We use, henceforth, only this value because it depends on a single
parameter, the number of muon neutrinos in the lattice.

It can be veriﬁed easily that the mass m(νµ) = 47.5 meV/c2

·
of anti-muon neutrinos. It then follows that the energy in the rest masses of
all muon and anti-muon neutrinos is 67.8 MeV, that is 48.5% of the energy of
the rest mass of the π± mesons. A small part of m(π±)c2
⋆ goes, as we will see,
into the electron neutrino masses, the rest goes into the lattice oscillations.
We can now determine the rest mass of the π± mesons from the sum of
the oscillation energies and the sum of the rest masses of the neutrinos. For
the sum of the energies of the frequencies we use Eq.(18) with the same N and
ν0 we used for the γ-branch. For the double integral in (18) of the corrected
axial diatomic frequencies we ﬁnd the value π3 as can be easily derived from
the plot of the corrected frequencies in Fig. 6. The value of the double integral
in Eq.(18) for the axial diatomic frequencies ν = ν0φ is 1/2 of the value 2π3
of the same integral in the case of axial monatomic frequencies, because in
the latter case the increase of the corrected frequencies continues to φ1 = π,
whereas in the diatomic case the increase of the corrected frequencies ends
at π/2, see Fig. 6. We consider cg to be so close to c⋆ that it does not change
the value of the double integral signiﬁcantly. It can be calculated that the
time average of the velocity of the electron neutrinos in the π± mesons is ¯v
= 0.99993c⋆, if m(νe) = 0.55 meV/c2
⋆ as in Eq.(36). Consequently we ﬁnd
that the sum of the energies of the corrected diatomic neutrino frequencies
10−4 erg = 33.91 MeV. We double this amount because we deal
is 0.5433
with standing waves and ﬁnd that the energy of the neutrino oscillations
is 67.82 MeV. Adding to that the sum of the energy of the rest masses of
(47.5 + 0.55)meV = 68.57 MeV we obtain a value for
the neutrinos N/2
m(π±)c2
⋆(theor) = 136.39 MeV = 0.977m(π±)c2
139.57 MeV.
To this theoretical value of the mass we must add m(e±)c2
⋆ in order to obtain
the mass of the π± mesons plus or minus some possible binding energy. We
must keep in mind that the relation between the theoretical and experimental

⋆(exp) = 0.977

·

27

m(π±) still depends on the accuracy of the values of N and ν0 and on a small
correction due to the possible presence of surface waves on the lattice.

We have explained the π± mesons with neutrinos. This agrees with what
we learn from the decay of the π± mesons, 99.9877% of which decay with
the emission of a muon neutrino and a µ meson, which in turn consists of
neutrinos as well, as we will see in the next section. The antiparticle of
the π+ meson is the particle in which all frequencies of the neutrino lattice
oscillations have been replaced by frequencies with the opposite sign, all
neutrinos replaced by their antiparticles and the positive charge replaced by
the negative charge. Assuming that the antineutrinos have the same rest
mass as the neutrinos it follows that the antiparticle of the π+ meson has the
same mass as π+ but opposite charge, i.e. is the π− meson.

The primary decay of the K± mesons, say, K+
µ++νµ (63.5%), leads to
the same end products as the π± meson decay π+
µ+ + νµ. From this and
the composition of the µ mesons we learn that the K mesons must, at least
partially, be made of the same four neutrino types as the π± mesons namely
of muon neutrinos, anti-muon neutrinos, electron neutrinos and anti-electron
neutrinos and their oscillation energies. However the K± mesons cannot
be the (2.2) mode of the lattice oscillations of the π± mesons, because the
(2.2) mode of the neutrino lattice oscillations has an energy of 4Eν(π±) +
⋆ = (271.3 + 68.57)MeV = 340 MeV. The 340 MeV

Anyway, the concept of the K± mesons being solely a higher mode of the
π± mesons contradicts our point that the particles consist of the particles
π± + π0 (21.16%), as well as K+
into which they decay. The decays K±
π0 + µ+ + νµ (3.18%) make up 29.16%
→
of the K± meson decays. A π0 meson ﬁgures in each of these decays. If we
add the energy in the rest mass of a π0 meson m(π0)c2
⋆ = 134.97 MeV to the
340 MeV in the (2.2) mode of the π± meson then we arrive at an energy of
⋆. Therefore we conclude that the K±
475 MeV, which is 96.2% of m(K±)c2
mesons consist of the (2.2) mode of the π± mesons plus a π0 meson. Then it
is natural that µ mesons from the decay of the (2.2) mode of the π± mesons
in the K± mesons as well as π0 mesons from the π0 component in the K±
mesons appear as decay products of the K± meson. It may be coincidental
but is interesting that the ratio 0.273 of the energy in the π0 meson to the
energy in the K± mesons closely resembles the 29.16% of the decays in which
the π0 meson is one of the decay products.

28

We obtain the K0 meson if we superpose onto the (2.2) mode of the
π± mesons instead of a π0 meson a basic mode of the π± mesons with a
charge opposite to the charge of the (2.2) mode of the π± meson. The
K0 mesons, or the state (2.2)π± + π∓, is made of neutrinos only without
a photon component, because the (2.2) mode of π± as well as the basic
mode π∓ consist of neutrinos only. Since the mass of a π± meson is by 4.59
MeV/c2
⋆ larger than the mass of a π0 meson the mass of K0 should be larger
than m(K±), and indeed m(K0)

The neutron is the superposition of a K+ and a K− meson or of two K0
mesons. The neutrino oscillations in the neutron must be coupled in order
to have spin 1/2, just as the Λ baryon with spin 1/2 is a superposition of
two η mesons. With m(K±)(theor) = 475 MeV/c2
⋆ from above it follows that
⋆ = 1.011m(n)(exp). The D±
m(n)(theor) = 2m(K±)(theor) = 950 MeV/c2
mesons are the superposition of a proton and a neutron of opposite spin and
hence have no spin, whereas the superposition of a proton and a neutron
with the same spin creates the deuteron with spin 1. In this case the proton
and neutron interact with the strong force which will be discussed in the last
section. The D±
S mesons seem to be the superposition of a π0 meson on the
D± mesons.

→

The proton does not decay and does not tell which particles it is made
of. However we learn about the structure of the proton through the decay of
p + e− + ¯νe (100%). One single anti-electron neutrino is
the neutron n
emitted when the neutron decays and 1.3 MeV are released. But there is no
place for a permanent vacancy of a single missing neutrino and for a small
amount of permanently missing oscillation energy in a nuclear lattice. As it
appears the entire anti-electron neutrino type is removed from the structure
of the neutron in the neutron decay and converted to available energy. This

29

process will be discussed again in the following section on the µ meson.
On the other hand, it seems to be certain that the proton contains a cubic
lattice consisting of four muon and four anti-muon neutrinos in each lattice
cell. This lattice exists already in the superposition of a K+ and a K− or of
two K0 mesons which make up the neutron. The muon-anti-muon neutrino
lattice is not aﬀected by the decay of the neutron, no muon neutrino of either
type is emitted. The neutron from the K+ and K− mesons also contains the
superposition of two basic photon lattice oscillations, which are not aﬀected
by the neutron decay either, otherwise the energy released could not be only
1.3 MeV. So the proton contains a cubic muon neutrino-anti-muon neutrino
lattice and the superposition of two π0 mesons. Whether or not N/2 electron
neutrinos are part of the proton structure awaits clariﬁcation of the structure
of the electron.

±

The average factor 0.85

0.025 in the ratios of the particles of the ν-
branch to the π± mesons is a consequence of the neutrino rest masses. They
make it impossible that the ratios of the particle masses are integer multiples
because the particles consist of the energy in the neutrino oscillations plus
the neutrino rest masses which are independent of the order of the lattice
oscillations. Since the contribution in percent of the neutrino rest masses
to the ν-branch particle masses decreases with increased particle mass the
factor in front of the mass ratios of the ν-branch particles must decrease with
increased particle mass.

To summarize: We have found that the π± mesons can be described by
the oscillations in a cubic lattice consisting of muon neutrinos and electron
neutrinos and their antiparticles. The energy in the π± mesons is the sum of
the oscillation energies plus the energy in the rest masses of the neutrinos.
For the explanation of the K± mesons, as well as for the explanation of the
neutron and the D mesons it is necessary to have also a π0 meson present
in the particles. When the π0 meson is incorporated in the K± meson the
decay modes of the K± meson appear to be natural. For the explanation of
the neutrino branch particles we need neutrinos and photons.

7 The mass of the µ± mesons

Surprisingly one can also explain the mass of the µ± mesons with the standing
wave model as we have shown in [31]. The µ mesons are part of the lepton
family which is distinguished from the mesons and baryons not so much by

30

their mass as the name lepton implies, actually the mass of the τ meson
is about twice the mass of the proton, but rather by the absence of strong
interaction with the mesons and baryons. The masses of the leptons are not
explained by the standard model of the particles.

their lifetime is τ (µ±) = 2.19703

the accuracy with which the masses m(νµ) = m(¯νµ) and m(νe) = m(¯νe) have

few percent, considering in particular the uncertainty of the lattice constant.

We have still to account for one type of electron neutrino which, acording
to our model of the π± mesons, is part of the neutrino lattice of the π±
mesons but does not appear in the decay of, say, the π+ meson π+
µ+ +
νµ followed by µ+
e+ + ¯νµ + νe. The missing anti-electron neutrino ¯νe in
the π+ decay sequence must go with the emitted positron. Whether or not
this interpretation is correct can be decided only after the explanation of the
structure of the electrons or positrons.

Since according to the statement (a) the decay of the π± meson seems to
mean the removal of all νµ, respectively, all ¯νµ neutrinos from the neutrino
lattice of the π± mesons, the µ mesons should contain the remaining neu-
trinos of the original cubic lattice, that means N/4 anti-muon neutrinos ¯νµ,
respectively, N/4 muon neutrinos νµ, plus N/4 electron neutrinos νe as well
as N/4 anti-electron neutrinos ¯νe. If we use the value of m(νµ) = 47.5meV/c2
⋆
from Eq.(35) we ﬁnd that Eν(µ±)/Eν(π±) = 0.9997, as in statement (b). We
will show in the following why the energies in the frequencies of π± and µ±
mesons are the same.

→

The neutrinos in the body of the µ mesons must oscillate because the
collision e+ + e−
µ+ + µ− tells that a continuum of frequencies must
be present in the µ mesons, if Fourier analysis holds. The energy of the
oscillations of the neutrinos in the µ meson lattice is the sum of the energies of
¯νµ neutrinos
a longitudinal oscillation in a diatomic lattice consisting of N/4
νe neutrinos, part of the remains of the diatomic neutrino lattice
and N/4
of the π± mesons, plus the energy of the diatomic oscillations of N/4
¯νµ
¯νe neutrinos which were likewise in the neutrino lattice of the π±
and N/4
mesons. The latter oscillations are likely to be perpendicular to the ﬁrst
mentioned ¯νµ-νe oscillations because the ¯νe-νe neutrino pairs are oriented
perpendicular to the ¯νµ-¯νe neutrino pairs in the original cubic lattice of the
π± mesons, see Fig. 5.

of the oscillations are the same for the diatomic neutrino pairs in the π±
mesons and the diatomic neutrino pairs in the µ mesons because they must
obey the group velocity limitation. When both functions are the same for the
π± and the µ± mesons the ratio of the energy in the diatomic ¯νµ-νe lattice
oscillations of the µ mesons to the energy of the diatomic lattice oscillations
in the π± mesons is 1/2 because the number of the pairs ¯νµ-νe in the µ
mesons is 1/2 of the combined number N of the pairs ¯νµ-νe and νµ-¯νe in the
π± mesons. But since the same applies for the diatomic oscillations of the
¯νµ-¯νe pairs in the µ± mesons, the sum of the energies of both oscillations is
equal to the oscillation energy of the π± mesons, as (b) says.

Finally we ask why do the µ mesons not interact strongly with the mesons
and baryons? We will show in the next section that a strong force emanates
from the sides of a cubic lattice caused by the unsaturated weak forces of
about 106 neutrinos at the surface of the neutrino lattice of the mesons and
baryons. This follows from the study of Born and Stern [32] which dealt with
the forces between two parts of a cubic lattice cleaved in vacuum. If the µ
mesons have a lattice consisting of one type of muon neutrinos, say, ¯νµ and of
νe and ¯νe neutrinos their lattice surface is not the same as the surface of the
cubic lattice of the mesons and baryons as described by the standing wave
model. Therefore it does not seem likely that the µ mesons interact in the
same way with the mesons and baryons as the mesons and baryons interact
with each other. To put this in another way, the µ meson lattice does not
bond with the cubic lattice of the mesons and baryons.

To summarize: It has been shown that the mass of the µ± mesons can be
109 muon neutrinos, respec-
explained as the sum of the rest masses of 0.7
tively anti-muon neutrinos, as well as the same number of electron neutrinos
and anti-electron neutrinos, plus their oscillation energies. The three neu-
trino types in the µ mesons are the remains of the cubic neutrino lattice of
the π± mesons from which the µ mesons are formed in the π± decay. The
energy contained in the sum of the rest masses of all muon or anti-muon neu-
trinos in the π± mesons is lost during the π± decay, whereas the oscillation
energy of all neutrinos in the π± is preserved during the decay. Hence the

mass of the µ± mesons diﬀers from the mass of the π± mesons by the sum of
the energies of the rest masses of N/4 muon neutrinos which is 33.9 MeV ∼=

µ mesons do not interact with the mesons and baryons in the same strong
way as the mesons and baryons interact with each other.

8 The weak and strong nuclear force

The potential of the force which holds a cubic ionic lattice together has been
determined by Born and Land´e (B&L) [33]. They assumed that the static
electric potential Φ of an elementary cube in the lattice has an attractive and
repulsive part and is of the form

from the sum of the contributions of all ions of the lattice, using a method
originally introduced by Madelung. According to Eq.(5) of B&L it is then

In mechanics the value of the compression modulus is known. We follow
the same route as B&L and use, as we have done before in [34], for κ the
value which follows from the compression modulus of the nucleon KA =
900 to 1200 MeV, as determined theoretically by Bhaduri, Dey and Preston
[35]. The value of KA found by them is supported by other theoretical and
experimental studies of KN M of nuclei. Setting KA = 1000 MeV and using

Born [36] has used lattice theory to explain the elasticity constant c11 of
cubic crystals which we need to calculate the rest mass of the muon neutrino
from Eq.(29).
In general c11 must be proportional to the inverse of the
compressibility κ because of the relation

Considering the sum of the forces acting between the lattice points Born
arrived at an equation for c11 which we approximated in Eq.(17) of [34] by

nuclear lattice we replace e2 by g2, use for (n

The uncertainty of the value of c11 is largely due to the uncertainty of n
which is caused by the uncertainty of the value of the compression modulus
κ. Although the mass of the muon neutrino calculated from Eq.(29) with
this value of c11 is about 50% larger than the mass of the muon neutrino
determined from the decay of the µ meson it is important to be able to
determine m(νµ) theoretically from lattice theory.

A side of a NaCl monocrystal cleaved in vacuum exerts a strong attractive
short-range force on the other side of the cleaved crystal. So does the side
of a cubic nuclear lattice exert an attractive force on the side of another
cubic nuclear lattice.
In the standing wave model the strong force is the
sum of the weak forces originating from the lattice points at the sides of the
lattice. From the potential of the weak force between the lattice points we
can determine the force by which one side of a nuclear lattice attracts the
side of another nuclear lattice. As follows from Eq.(45) the force between
two cells of a cubic nuclear lattice separated by the distance δ is given by

The two cells will certainly not bond when the distance between the two cells
exceeds the range of the weak nuclear force, if not at a smaller distance. The
range of the weak force is given by a = 10−16 cm, and δ0 is 2a. So the force
required to separate the surfaces of two cubic lattice cells is at least

That means that the ratio of the strong nuclear force to the weak nuclear
force is on the order of 106. An accurate value of the ratio of the strong
and weak nuclear forces is apparently not known from the experiments other
than that it is said that the ratio of the strong nuclear interaction constant
αs to the weak interaction constant αw is αs ≈

106αw.

Conclusions

It is very natural to assume that the mesons and baryons consist of the
particles into which they decay. From the well-known decays follows that
the particle spectrum consists of a γ-branch and a neutrino branch. We also
take for granted that the elementary integer multiple rule for the ratios of
the masses of the mesons and baryons is a consequence of the structure of the
particles. We take it for granted that Fourier analysis holds in high energy
collisions of the particles, which means that a continuum of high frequencies
must be present in the collision products. And we believe that the consensus
of opinion that the weak nuclear force has a range on the order of 10−16 cm
is realistic. On these points we base our model of the mesons and baryons.
We have studied cubic nuclear lattices consisting of either photons or neu-
trinos whose lattice points are 10−16 cm apart. After a high energy collision
the lattice points must oscillate and thereby satisfy the requirement that
a continuous spectrum of high frequencies must be present in the mesons
and baryons. The oscillations are in the form of standing waves. Standing
waves do not have to propagate, so the particles can have a rest mass al-
though the particles of the γ-branch consist of electromagnetic waves. The
frequency spectrum of the waves is determined by the group velocity which
cannot exceed the velocity of light. The sum of the energies contained in
the frequencies of all standing waves determines the mass of the particles.
Because of the group velocity limitation the energy of the diﬀerent oscillation
modes or superpositions of modes are integer multiples of the basic mode.
The masses of the particles of the γ-branch are therefore integer multiples
of the basic mode or of the π0 meson, in agreement with what the ratios
of the particle masses strongly suggest. Each particle has automatically an
antiparticle. The size of the particles is limited by the radiation pressure to
about 10−13 cm. The absolute value of the energy of the π0 meson is that of
a cubic black body ﬁlled with standing electromagnetic waves whose energy
is determined by Planck’s classical formula for the energy of a linear oscilla-

38

tor. The masses of the particles of the γ-branch can thus be explained using
photons only. A very conservative explanation which avoids the introduction
of any new particle.

As the decay of the neutrino branch particles suggests we assume that
they consist of muon and electron neutrinos and their antiparticles. The
oscillations of the neutrino lattice contain the continuum of frequencies which
must be in the ν-branch particles after their creation. The energy in the ν-
branch particles is not only the energy of all lattice oscillations but is the sum
of the energy in the neutrino lattice oscillations and the energy in the rest
masses of the 109 neutrinos making up the lattice. The π± mesons consist of
the four types of neutrinos and their oscillation energies, plus electric charge.
Their mass so determined is 0.98m(π±)(exp). On the other hand, a π0 meson
has to be superposed on the (2.2) mode of the π± meson oscillations in order
to explain the mass of the K± mesons. Then it is natural that π0 mesons
appear in 29% of the K± decays. For the explanation of the higher modes
of the particles of the ν-branch it is necessary to consider neutrinos and
standing electromagnetic waves and charge.

The mass of the µ mesons can also be explained with a neutrino lattice.
The µ mesons consist of the neutrinos remaining after the decay of the π±
neutrino lattice. All muon neutrinos of one type, either the muon neutrinos
or the anti-muon neutrinos, are removed from the neutrino lattice of the π±
mesons in its decay. That releases the sum of the energy of their rest masses
which is ∼= 1/4
⋆. Since it can be shown that the oscillation energy of
·
all neutrinos in the π± mesons is conserved in the decay, the energy of the rest
m(π±)c2
mass of the µ± mesons is ∼= 3/4
⋆, in near agreement with the exact
ratio m(µ±)/m(π±) = 0.757028. From the decay of the π± mesons follows
that the rest mass of the muon neutrino is m(νµ) = 47.5 milli-eV/c2
⋆. From
the decay of the neutron follows that the rest mass of the electron neutrino
is m(νe) = 0.55 meV/c2
⋆.

Born’s lattice theory provides the means to determine the potential of
the force which extends from one lattice point to the next and thereby holds
the lattice together. Following Born’s approach exactly, replacing only e2 by
the weak interaction constant g2, we learn that at the lattice distance a the
repulsive term of the potential diﬀers from the attractive term by only 10−12.
We also learn that from the weak force in the lattice follows automatically
the existence of the strong nuclear force emanating from the sides of the
lattice, caused by the 106 unsaturated weak forces at a side of the lattice.

We conclude that the standing wave model solves a number of problems

39

for which an answer heretofore has been hard to come by. Only photons and
neutrinos and charge are needed to explain the stable mesons and baryons.
In a forthcoming paper we will show that the spin of the baryons can also be
explained with the standing wave model.

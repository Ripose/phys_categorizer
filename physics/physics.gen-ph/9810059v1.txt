From the Field Electron Model to the
Uniﬁed Field Theory

1 Deﬁnition of Field Sources.

Maxwell-Lorentz equations for potentials are taken as the basis. Left parts of equations
remain unchanged and are considered precise, but ﬁeld sources in the right part a given
a new deﬁnition.Spherically symmetrical electron at rest is described in the spherical
coordinate system, S. There are two sets of currents with diﬀerent charge signs in each
point:

~±(R, ψ) = ρ±(R, ψ)

~v(R, ψ),

v±(

, ψ) = 1,

λ = cos ψ =

(A)

·

∞

(~v, ~R)
vR

,

and the system of units in which the velocity of light is equal to one is selected.

These currents form stationary current threads of moving Ons — marked elements of
continuos charged medium. Continuity equation is satisﬁed for each charge sign indepen-
dently. The ends of each current thread rest on inﬁnity and each thread has an opposite
one, i.e. coinciding with the direct one to within velocity sign or time.

When coming from the inﬁnity where the ﬁeld is equal to zero, charged Ons are
aﬀected by the ﬁeld of electron Ae and form pairs of direct and opposite current threads
in accordance with equation of On motion in the ﬁeld

Current thread pairs generate ﬁeld in correspondence with Maxwell-Lorents equations

and the sum of all ﬁelds generated by all current threads of two charge signs gives us an
electron ﬁeld

a
X
An electron is declared as a pair one element of which is the ﬁeld, Ae, and the other
element — the whole set of current threads, Ja, of two charge signs. Each element of the
pair gives birth to itself through its partner.

retarded and advanced potentials of Lienar-Vichert.

Ja = D(Ae).

Aa = M(Ja),

Ae =

But now, each of two summands is an average of an retarded ﬁeld of an On of one
current thread and an advanced ﬁeld of an On of an opposite current thread of this pair.
Both summands have equal rights and their division into retarded and advanced terms
becomes arbitrary.

The natural character and non-eliminability of M operator symmetry relative to time
reversal is the strongest reason for accepted deﬁnition of ﬁeld sources, the properties of
which are in conformity with the necessity to make vanish the sum of currents in each
point of electron at rest and are guaranteed by the invariance of the law of motion with
respect to time reversal.

The law of motion is declared a gnosiological derivative of the fundamental fact of
existence of identical electrons with all their properties of complete objects in the terms
of Maxwell-Lorentz equations with accepted deﬁnitions of sources (A) and the system of
equations (B).

Formally, the law of motion D is a possible solution of the system of equations, (B), if
all values are stationary and spherically symmetrical, currents are uniform and isotropic
at the inﬁnity, and Ae asymptotically approaches a Coulomb ﬁeld for large R.

2 The Law of Motion.

An arbitrary motion may be approximated by tangent uniformly accelerated motion when
the acceleration is constant in an instant accompanying reference system Σ, as the simplest
one after inertial motion.

Suppose, as a ﬁrst approximation, that this symmetry is global and all currents in the
whole space have the same WΣ. This WΣ is made equal to one by selecting an appropriate
system of units.

Three-dimensional equation of such motion

is transformed into the following system in the cylindrical coordinate system:

Consideration of the spin when applying the law of conservation of On moment for
motion along current thread in the hyperbolic approximation for currents changes the
mass at rest ∆µ making it less singular and accordingly decreasing the intensity of ﬁeld
necessary to generate On currents in the vicinity of the center.

The beauty of Lagrangian (L) requires calculations of ﬁeld and currents on its base.
Interpretation of the hyperbolic solution (G) has been made assuming that the integral
of intensities of reversed ﬁelds generated by spherical layers from R to
exceeds the
1 to R for all R by absolute value. This represents the ﬁeld of electron
integral from 1
similar to the ﬁeld of stationery negative charge distributed near the center as the residue
of prevailing reverse ﬁeld of positively charged currents. Such concept of electron ﬁeld
structure seems to be preferable.

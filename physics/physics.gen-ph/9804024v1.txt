ABSTRACT

It is shown that, in Dirac theory, there is a spatial velocity of a free electron

which commutes with the Hamiltonian, so it is a conserved quantity of the motion.

Furthermore, there is a spatial orbital angular momentum which also commutes with

the Hamiltonian and is a constant of the motion.

1. The spatial velocity for a of Dirac electron:

To descrive the motion of a free electron, besides the space-time coordinates

(X, ct) = (x1x2x3x4), Dirac introduced also (α1α2α3β) = (αβ) for the internal mo-

tion in the electron which operate on a complex spinor space. Since the spatial space

and the spinor space are basically independent, so the α′s and β are independent

of and commute with the x′s and the p′s, where (p1p2p3p4) are the momentum and

energy of the electron. The Hamiltonian of the free electron is gien as

Dirac showed that

H = cα · P + mc2β.

X = cα,

where ξ0 is the ξ(t) when t = 0, and the σ′s the Pauli matrices. Next, we calculate

the time derivative of η by taking the commutator of η with H and obtain

From equation (2) and equation (6), we get

η = cα − c2P H −1.

The operator c2P H −1 commutes with the Hamiltonian H, and has eigen value v =

P /M (M is the total mass), which is a velocity vector of a free particle. So it can

be simultaneously measured with H and is a conserved quantity during the course

motion. Therefore we conclude that c2PiH −1 = vi is the eigen value obtained by a

measurement of the i-component of the velocity of a free electron.

It may be worthwhile to mention that, since for the moment we do not know

exactly the operation rules in the theory for the vector ξ. So when we have to deal

with this vector, we should express it as ξi = xi − ηi, and then deal with xi and

ηi. Otherwise we may have trouble. For instance, the commutator for p and q is

[q, p] = i¯h, so [x1, p1] = i¯h = [ξ1 + η1, p1] = [ξ1, p1] + [η1, p1]. From equation (5) we see

that η1 commutes with p1 so [η1, p1] = 0, and [ξ, p1] = i¯h. Then if we take [x1, H] =

[ξ1, H] + [η1, H] = i¯h ˙x1, we will get ˙x1 = cα1 + cα1 − c2p1H −1 = 2cα1 − c2p1H −1,

which is wild when we compare it with equation (2). This example says that we can

not operate directly with the ξ′s. We have to operate with the (x′s − η′s).

Consider two classical harmonic oscillators with coordinates z1 and z2 and their

Hamiltonions H1 and H2. When there is no coupling between them, z1 and z2 will

oscillate independently and seperately. However, if there is a coupling between them,

the total Hamiltonian will become H1 + H2 + H12. When we diagonalize the system,

the coordinates z1 and z2 will get mixed, and the normal coordinates will be a mixture

of z1 and z2.

If Ψ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian H in equation (1), then it is an eigen-

function of the Hamiltonion H ′ = H 2. The Hamiltonian H ′ has only spatial quantities

(without α and β). Thus Ψ must be able to describe a system which has only spatial

variables. On the other hand, H is a Hamiltonian which contains interactions between

momentum and spin. So the generalized coordinates of the system (the x′

is), which

are the dynamical conjugate variables of momentum, must be a mixture of both spa-

tial and spin variables as we can see from equations (3,4,5). The time derivatives of

the x′

is are then mixtures of the time derivatives of both kinds of variables. However,

only the component which is pure spatial is experimentally measurable.

2. The spatial orbital angular momentum of a free Dirac electron:

Consider an angular momentum ℓ deﬁned as

ℓ = (X − η) × P = ξ × P .

(8)

Since P is a constant vector of the motion, from equation (7) we see that the time

derivative of ℓ vanishes. So ℓ commutes with H and is a constant of the motion and

can be simultaneously measured with the Hamiltonian. Also, vi is a spatial velocity

and is a constant of motion. ξi is the time integration of vi, so it is a spatial variable.

Therefore, ℓ is the spatial angular momentum of the free electron.

It is well known that the electron has an intrinsic angular momentum of

σ due

to the SU(2) symmetry. In reference (Dirac 1958), Dirac showed that the σ′s do not

commute with the Hamiltonian (1), so the spin angular momentum is not a constant

of the motion. But the Hamiltonian (1) is rotational invariant, the total angular

momentum must be conserved. Through the interaction between the spin and the

spatial variables, the rotational symmetry will induce an angular momentum term,

which arises from coupling the two parts of variables in order to conserve the total

angular momentum. The simplest form of this term which meets those requirements

is η × P . Finally we have for the total angular momentum as

j = ξ × P + η × P +

σ.

If we combine the ﬁrst two terms together, we will just have j = X × P +

σ.

However, equation (9) states that the total angular momentum is a sum of a spin, a

spatial, and a spin-spatial coupling term.

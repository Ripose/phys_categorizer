A Brief Note on Discrete Space Eﬀects

Abstract

We discuss brieﬂy discrete space eﬀects and show that this leads to
space reﬂection asymmetry and also a minor modiﬁcation of Einstein’s
energy-mass formula.

Snyder[1] had shown how it is possible to consider discrete space time con-
sistently with the Lorentz transformation. Discrete space time continues
to receive attention over the years from several scholars (Cf.
for example
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] for details). Indeed in the Dirac’s relativistic theory of the
electron, this discretization is evident - averages over the Compton scale are
required to eliminate Zitterbewegung eﬀects and non Hermitian position op-
erators and to recover meaningful physics[8, 9] - and that includes special
relativity. It is in this light that a recent formulation of an electron in terms
of a Kerr-Newman metric becomes meaningful[9, 10, 11] and further this
leads to a meaningful, if phenomenological mass spectrum [12, 13, 14].
All this pleasingly dovetails with the fact that if the minimum space time
cut oﬀs are taken at the Compton scale, then we have a non commutative
geometry viz.,

[x, y] = 0(l2)

(1)

and similar equations, and which further, leads directly to the Dirac equation
(Cf.[15] for details). This can be easily seen from the fact that, given (1),
the usual inﬁnitessimal coordinate shift in Minkowski space, is,

ψ′(xj) = [1 + ıǫ(ıǫljkxk

∂
∂xj

) + 0(ǫ2)]ψ(xj)

The choice

t =   1 0

0 − 1 ! , ~x =   0 ~σ
~σ 0 !

provides a representation for the coordinates, as can be easily veriﬁed and
then from (2) we recover the Dirac equation.
If on the other hand terms ∼ l2 are neglected, then (1) gives the usual com-
mutation relations of Quantum Theory. Discrete space time is therefore a
higher order correction to usual Quantum Theory.
In this context it has been pointed out that the discrete time provides an ex-
planation for the puzzling Kaon decay which violates time reversal symmetry
and also the decay of a pion into an electron and a positron[16, 8, 9, 12, 13].
We now observe that from an intuitive point of view space or time reversal
symmetries based on space time points theory cannot be taken for granted if
space time is discrete. This can immediately be seen from (1): If we retain
terms ∼ l2, then there is no invariance under space reﬂections.
Indeed in the same vein, as discussed earlier[9, 10], the fact that the Compton
wavelength of the nearly massless neutrino is very large provides an expla-
nation of its handedness.
We ﬁnally point out another 0(l2) eﬀect, which can be demonstrated in a
simple way by invoking the derivation of the wave equation of a particle by
replacing the continuum by a set of ”lattice points”[9, 17]. In this case we
have an equation like

Ea(xn) = E0a(xn) − Aa(xn + b) − Aa(xn − b).

where b is the distance between successive ”lattice points”. This leads to

E = E0 − 2Acoskb.

(3)

We can choose the zero of energy in such a way that when b → 0, we have
E = 2A which is then identiﬁed with the rest energy mc2 of the particle(Cf.[9]
for details).
However if we do not neglect terms ∼ b2 = l2, then we have from (3)

It must be reiterated that when terms ∼ l2 are neglected, we recover the usual
theory. Finally, the above conclusions are true with minor modiﬁcations in
case the minimum cut oﬀ is non-zero but not the Compton wavelength.

A relation connecting the rest mass and separation of events in space-time con-

tinuum is suggested and the idea of Compton scattering is used as a method for the

determination of rest mass. An experiment involving collision of photons resulting in

creation of rest mass is discussed theoretically in order to illustrate the connection for-

mula.

Historically the rest mass ﬁrst appears in the special theory of relativity

as a mathematical by-product when proper momentum was deﬁned and the conservation

of 4-momentum was taken into consideration [1]. P. G. Bergmann [1] in course of dis-

cussion on the relation between energy and mass in relativistic mechanics observed that

if kinetic energy of a mechanical system decreases, at least some of the rest masses of

the constituent system must increase. This so-called mass-energy equivalence accounts

for mass defect in atomic nuclei, disintegration energy of decay processes and so on and

so forth. Rest masses change appreciably when interaction energies have the order of

magnitude of the rest energies. Till to - date only a few attempts are made to determine

the rest mass experimentally; Jian Qi Shen [2] performed experiments on photon rest

mass. Though an attempt has been made by Donald Chang [3] to investigate the wave

properties corresponding to rest mass, no real eﬀort has yet been made to resolve the

fundamental question regarding the status of the rest mass and to consider whether any

basic principle is involved that inherently restricts its determination.

It is quite obvious that following deﬁnition [4] of energy in special theory of

relativity and principle of energy and momentum framed therein the loss of rest mass

accounts for the production of energy and vice versa. However the transfer of energy

(△E) is connected to time interval (△t) needed for the transfer to take place by

△E△t ≥ ¯h

(1)

and (△E) can be measured with the available measuring apparatus. But how can one

measure rest mass ? Obviously it cannot be done directly because any such eﬀort will

disturb the system to the extent of changing the rest energy E to some value E + △E.

One possible way is to consider Compton eﬀect where the theory assumes the particle

(scatterer) to be free and at rest before collision with the photon takes place. The Comp-

ton shift is given by

λ − λ0 = (h/mc)(1 − cosθ)

(2)

where λ and λ0 are the wavelengths respectively of scattered and incident waves, m is the

2

rest mass of the particle and θ is the angle of scattering. At a particular value of θ, the

measurement of the Compton shift can give an estimate of the rest mass. If one employs

the expression (2) to ﬁnd m, then it becomes clear that the limit to measure m accurately

depends on the limit to which λ and λ0 can be resolved. One can use Rayleigh’s criterion

of resolution to get the maximum value of rest mass that can be measured accurately, at

least in principle.

Now, the resolving power of an optical system is R = λ0/(λ − λ0), following

symbols of expression (2). The determination of rest mass depends on clear identiﬁcation

of the peaks for the two waves (incident and scattered). For this to happen the shift in

wavelength must be at least λ0/R, which leads to the inequation

m ≤ hR(1 − cosθ)/(cλ0)

(3)

In other words, m must have an upper limit.

Now, let us consider the following process (ref. Fig. 1) viz. collision of two

oppositely directed photons resulting in the creation of rest mass m, which in terms of

usual symbols of the equation for the conservation of 4-momentum can be written as

(hν/c)(1, ~k) + (hν/c)(1, −~k) = (2mc,~0),

~k being the unit vector along the momentum of ‘photon 1’. The Fig. 1 describes the

process in the space-time continuum (only one space dimension is shown). Thus,

2hν/c = 2mc

i.e. hν = mc2; and (hν/c)~k − (hν/c)~k = ~0

In this particular example, therefore, change △m in rest mass is of the order of hν/c2

which is equal to h/(cλm) where λm is the wavelength of either of the photons. Let △s

denote an inﬁnitesimally small interval separating events viz. collision of photons and

creation of mass at rest, s being given by

(△s)2 = c2(△τ )2 − |△~r|2

(the terms have their usual signiﬁcance).

taneously from x = a and x = −a, meet at x = 0 to form a point mass at rest.

The separation △s in this example should be of the order of λm. Thus,

In order to include the idea expressed in (3), expression (4) should be rewritten as

△m△s ∼ ¯h/c

△m△s ≤ ¯h/c

(5)

The very description that mass is at rest, makes one conceive of localization (in space-

time) of the system, and this is what is precisely given in (5). For the sake of an
application if we substitute in (5) the Planck mass (1019 GeV ) for △m, we get for △s a

0

value which is of the order of 10−33 cm, the Planck length.

For time like separation of events it might well be that with respect to an

observer |△~r| = 0; then △s = c△τ and in the context of creation of mass (as discussed

above in connection with the problem of two photons) the world line of the physical

system will obviously be traced in such a way that △τ becomes positive, otherwise

‘causality’ will be violated. This △τ signifying the separation in time of the two events,

must have a magnitude of the order of uncertainty △t of relation (1) when △E becomes

the energy equivalent of △m. Now for space-like separation it can be that with respect
to an observer △τ = 0, which means that (△s)2 < 0 i.e. △s is imaginary. Thus it is

evident from (5) that for space like separation of events mass creation is not possible.

Since loss of rest mass makes corresponding △E positive and the gain in rest

mass is always associated with loss in energy, △m and △E must have opposite signs;

the uncertainty relation expressed by (1) then follows simply from relation (5) for a time

like separation of events when mass is being created.

Origin of Non-linear Phenomena in Optics

Abstract

The non-linear relation between electric polarization and electric ﬁeld strength is achieved through intro-
ducing the retarded electromagnetic interactions between classical charge particles. The result agrees with
the phenomenological theory in current non-linear optics, means that the non-linear phenomena in optics
come from the retarded electromagnetic interaction between charged particles.

The current non-linear optics describes interaction between light and materials by the half-classical
method, i.e., use the classical theory of electromagnetic ﬁeld to describe light’s motion and quantum theory
to describe interaction between photons and material particles. The theory can deal with non-linear optics
well. The Maxwell equation of electromagnetic interaction in medium is

∇ × ~E =

∂ ~B
∂t

∇ · ~D = ρf

∇ × ~H = ~Jf +

∂ ~D
∂t

∇ · ~B = 0

The experiments show that for general non-iron electric medium and non-iron magnetic medium, under the
condition of weak ﬁeld, the relations between electric polarization ~P and electric ﬁeld strength, as well as
magnetic polarization ~M and magnetic ﬁeld strength are linear, connected by the so-called constructive
equations

~D = ε ~E = ε0 ~E + ~P
~P = ε0χe ~E

~B = µ ~H = µ0( ~H + ~M )

~M = χm ~H

But the experiments also show that in the strong ﬁelds, the relations between ~P and ~E, as well as ~M and
~H are non-linear and vary complex. This kind of relations can’t be deduced from theory at present. We
now get them by phenomenological hypothesis. For example, in the non-linear optics, the relation between
electric polarization ~P and electric ﬁeld strength is supposed to be (1)

~P = ε0(χ1

interaction between charged particles are considered, we can obtain Eq.(5) easy and shows that the non-
linear phenomena in optics come from the retarded electromagnetic interaction between charged particles.

Mediums are composed of atoms and molecules, and atoms and molecules can be regarded as electrical
dipoles composed of two particles with charges ±q. Suppose the distance between two charges is rij (t) at time
t, the electrical dipole moment is ~Pj. The direction of ~Pj = qj~rij is from the point the j -particle located
pointing to the mass center point ~ri of electric dipole. By considering the retarded eﬀect of interaction,
according to Eq.(9), the retarded electrical dipole moment becomes approximately

there is only one electrical dipole in space, the directions of ~rij , ~vj, ~aj and ˙~aj are on the same straight line.
In this case, the subscript can be removed and Eq.(11) can be written as

Besides multiple frequencies, sum frequencies and diﬀerent frequencies would appear.

Because v = Aω cos(ωt − θ0) = Aω sin(ωt − θ0 − π′2), there is a diﬀerence of phase π/2 between v/ω and
r. There is also a diﬀerence of phase π/2 between ˙a/ω3 and r. If these diﬀerences are omitted, we can let
v ≃ ωr, ˙a ≃ ω3r. Considering a = −ω2r, put the relations into Eq.(12), we get

But it should be noted that the results exists phase diﬀerences between on Eq.(29) and (12) and Eq.(12) is
fundamental.

In the practical systems, there exist many dipoles and interactions between dipoles. Besides vibrations,
dipoles may rotate and shift, so the directions of ~rij , ~vj, ~aj and ˙~aj are not on the same straight lines in

Because the model of dipole is only a kind of approximation, by considering interactions between particles as
well as by considering other complex factors, in general situation, the non-linear relation between electrical
polarization and electric ﬁeld strength should be written as the form of product form of tensors

~P = ε0(χ1

This is just the foundational relation used in non-linear optics.

In order to explain the origin of non-linear phenomena in optics or Eq.(32), the non-linear oscillator

model is discussed at present. The motion equation of oscillator is written as (1)

d2r
dt2 + 2β

dr
dt

+ ω2

0r + Dr2 =

In the formula, mDr2 is the non-linear force to cause non-linear eﬀects. However, it should be seen that the
origin of this item is still unclear. Where it comes from? Why is takes such form, not mDr1/2 or mDr3
and so on. The current theory can’t provide clear explanation. Meanwhile, the value of parameter D can’t
be decided by theory. Quantum mechanics provides a method of perturbation approximation to calculate
polarizability, but does not yet provide explanation for the origin of non-linear phenomena. So it is proper
to consider that the origin of non-linear in optics comes from the retarded electromagnetic interaction.

Because ~v → −~v, ~a → ~a, ˙~a → ˙~a under time reversal, so ~r′ shown in Eq.(11) can’t keep unchanged under
time reversal. In this way, it can be said that most of non-linear phenomenon in optics violate symmetry of
time reversal.

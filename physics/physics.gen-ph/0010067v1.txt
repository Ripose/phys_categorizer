Time invariance problem of a photon absorption process in atoms

Abstract

and molecules is discussed.

PACS number: 42.50.-p

The Dirac equation, in the case of electromagnetic interaction, is not
invariant under unitary time inversion [1]. However, a common opinion exists
that the electromagnetic interaction in nature must be time invariant [2]. The
attempts to ﬁnd what is a proof basis of such point of view in a special case
of a photon absorption process in atoms and molecules give only indistinct
references point at Einstein’s works [3].

If one keeps in mind the Einstein coeﬃcients of absorption and stimulated
emission, this basis is erroneous. The Einstein coeﬃcients characterize inte-
gral cross-section of optical transition. Time invariance preserving demands
equality not only the integral cross-section, but also it demands equality of
spectral width of forward and backward optical transitions. Einstein nothing
writes about the width of optical transitions. So, Einstein coeﬃcients have
no direct connection to T-invariance of photon absorption process.

There is also exists the Einstein’s opinion ”that physics could be restricted
to the time-symmetric case for which retarded and advanced ﬁelds are equiv-
alent” [4]. Obviously there is a main basis of existing point of view, because
of any experimental result in proof of T-invariance preserving in a photon
absorption process is absent.

In contrast, for the opposite point of view we have one direct and com-
plete experimental proof and a number of indirect evidences. The direct and
complete experimental proof is connected with the experimental study of
the so-called line wings [5]. The experiments clearly show a very strong T-
invariance violation in a photon absorption process in molecules. Although
the integral cross-section of forward and backward optical transitions are ob-
viously the same, the spectral width and cross-section for such transitions
diﬀer on several order of magnitude [6].

The concept of T-invariance violation of a photon absorption process is
a good basis for explanation of most eﬀects in nonlinear optics from a pure
quantum position without using any semiclassical approximation [7]. There

are indirect experimental proofs. The most striking example is the popula-
tion transfer eﬀect in the case of sweeping a resonance conditions in a two
level system. On the basis of T-invariance violation of absorption process
this eﬀect has a simple and natural explanation [8]. In contrast, on the basis
of semiclassical wave approximation theory the explanation of this eﬀect looks
like as the ravings of a madman [9].
On the whole such situation may be called as the second ”Einstein paradox”a.
When great authority and delusion of one scientist delay on decades progress
of physical theory in some ﬁelds of scientiﬁc research. So, do we have ”Einstein
paradox” in quantum optics?

aThe ﬁrst paradox is connected with quantum statistics [10,11].

A new internal description of fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons), based on
a matrix-generalization (F) of the scalar fermion-number f , predicts that only three
families of quarks and leptons, and their associated neutrino ﬂavors (νe, νµ and ντ ),
exist. Moreover, this description appears to place important topological constraints
on neutrino mixing. For example, with respect to F, the topology of the νe (νµ or
ντ ) neutrino ﬂavor is found to be that of a cylinder (M¨obius strip). Assuming that
neutrino-neutrino transitions exhibiting topology change (i.e., νe
→
νe) are suppressed, while neutrino-neutrino transitions without topology-change (i.e.,
νe
νµ) are relatively enhanced, one
may have an explanation for recent short-distance (i.e., “atmospheric”) observations of
(nearly) maximal νµ-ντ mixing. To test this idea, I was able to use simple topological
arguments to uniquely determine the (symmetric) matrix of time-average probabilities
describing long-distance neutrino mixtures, which is identical to
Mαβ =
that proposed by Georgi and Glashow on diﬀerent grounds.
In particular, using a
conventional parameterization of the CKM-like neutrino mixing matrix U , and the
proposed topological constraints, I predict the following mixing angle parameters: s2
2 =
1 = 1 or c2
c2
2 = s2
1 = 0, with a Dirac-type CP-noninvariant phase factor
eiδ, weakly constrained by sin2 δ
= 1 or cos2 δ
= 0 (i.e., CP violation is not maximal).
Then Mαβ is predicted to be Mαβ = (M11 = 1
2 , M12 = M13 = 1
4 , M22 = M23 = M33 =
3
8 ). Experimental veriﬁcation of these predictions would provide strong circumstantial
evidence in support of the new description of fundamental fermions, which requires,
among other things, that the νe and (νµ or ντ ) neutrino ﬂavors start and end “life” as
topologically-distinct quantum objects.

1.0 Introduction

Except where explicitly prevented by some “absolute” conservation law (e.g., the conserva-
tion of electric charge or spin angular momentum), quantum mechanics generally permits
transitions between states having diﬀerent topologies [1]. While a change in topology may
be energetically (or otherwise) inhibited, unavoidable quantum ﬂuctuations are expected to
catalyze such processes. Hence, there is always the possibility of mixing between otherwise
similar quantum states having distinct topologies [2].

Recently, a new internal description of fundamental fermions (quarks and leptons) was
proposed [3]. The new description is based on a matrix-generalization F of the scalar fermion
number f . One of the main predictions of the new description is that only three families
of quarks and leptons exist—hence that there are only three low-mass neutrino ﬂavors,
namely, the νe, νµ and ντ neutrinos. Moreover, because of the way fundamental fermions are
represented by certain geometric objects in the space on which the matrix transformation F
acts (See Appendix A, and Ref. 3, p. 57, pp. 85–87, and Ref. 4, pp. 244–255), the νe and (νµ
or ντ ) neutrino ﬂavors are found to have diﬀerent topologies with respect to F. This fact
could have important implications for neutrino mixing [5].

With respect to the matrix transformation F, the topology of both the νµ and ντ is
found to be that of a M¨obius strip (Ref. 4, p. 143). By contrast, the topology of the νe
(with respect to F) is that of a cylinder. And because we assume that a change in topology
during transitions tends to be suppressed, the foregoing topological distinctions between
neutrinos may help explain recent observations of (nearly) maximal νµ-ντ mixing [6, 7].
However, it is important to stress at the outset that there are good reasons for believing
that similar topological distinctions among quarks do not play an important role in d, s, b
quark mixing (See Ref. 8 and Sec. A.4.2). The principal purpose of this paper then, will be
to focus attention almost exclusively on neutrinos, and to determine the constraints that the
proposed topological distinctions place on conventional νe, νµ, ντ neutrino mixtures.

2.0 Conventional Description of Neutrino Mixing

At “birth” via weak decays, or upon detection via weak capture interactions, neutrinos have
a deﬁnite ﬂavor and topology [9]. However, between birth and detection they are in a mixed
state having no deﬁnite ﬂavor or topology. In this intermediate region the probability of
ﬂavor (or topology) maintenance and/or change oscillates. Only at great distances from the
neutrino source do these oscillations ﬁnally “damp out.”

In the conventional description of three-ﬂavor neutrino mixing ﬂavor eigenstates are re-
lated to neutrino mass eigenstates (states of deﬁnite mass) via a unitary Cabibbo-Kobayashi-
Maskawa (CKM)-like “mixing” matrix Uαi, as follows [10, 11]

for Uαi, (1) becomes [12]

3.0 Proposed Topological Constraints on Neutrino Mix-

ing

In this paper we will show, among other things, that certain proposed qualitative topological

parameters, in turn, serve to provide a unique determination of the matrix
Given that the νe (νµ or ντ ) neutrino ﬂavor has the topology of a cylinder (M¨obius strip)
with respect to the internal transformation F, and assuming that topological constraints are
the primary determinants of the matrix M describing long-distance neutrino mixtures, the
form of M is easily determined. Moreover, these same topological constraints can be used
to place numerical bounds on the components of M. To accomplish these results we need
only apply the following very general principle to neutrino-neutrino transitions:

Pνα→νβ i

Pνα→νβ i

h

All other things being equal, any neutrino ﬂavor να (i.e., νe, νµ or ντ ), which undergoes
neutrino-neutrino transitions that change neutrino topology, will tend to be suppressed, while
neutrino-neutrino transitions that maintain neutrino topology will tend to be (relatively)
enhanced [5].

To this principle we add the following corollary,

All other things being equal, because the νµ and ντ neutrinos have the same topology, they
will act the same way in all neutrino-neutrino transitions (involving long-distance neutrino
mixtures).

Given these principles, and assuming as stated previously, that topological constraints
are the primary determinants of the matrix M, we immediately have the following topological
constraints on long-distance neutrino mixtures:

A. No matter what neutrino ﬂavor (να) and topology one starts with at some distant
source (say a supernova), by the time the neutrino mixture reaches its “equilibrium” state
(where all time-dependent oscillations have “damped out”), it should contain equal fractions
of νµ and ντ , because these neutrinos have the same topology.

4

B. Because the νµ and ντ neutrinos have the same topology, if one starts out with either
a pure νµ or a pure ντ source, one should end up with the same long-distance equilibrium
mixture of νe, νµ and ντ .

C. If topology is the controlling factor in describing long-distance neutrino mixtures, then
there should be absolutely no (eﬀective) diﬀerence between the two functions (of U-matrix
, because the νµ and ντ neutrinos
mixing parameters), which describe
have the same topology. Very loosely speaking we are assuming that these mathematical
functions are eﬀectively “topological invariants” with respect to the exchange of ﬂavor indices
µ and τ (See Ref. 4, pp. 20 and 21). That is, not only are the two functions
and
required to be equal, but they are also required to be equal, term-by-term (i.e., they
Pνe→ντ i

are required to be term-wise equal). Similarly the three functions
and
Pντ →ντ i

are required to be term-wise equal.

3.1 The form of the matrix M

Constraints A), B) and C) in the previous section, together with Eqs. (7) and (8), dictate
that the symmetric matrix M describing long-distance neutrino mixtures must have the form
expressed by



Moreover, the proposed topological constraints place numerical bounds on the matrix ele-
ments a, b and c. For example, because we are assuming that the νe is inhibited, but because
of quantum ﬂuctuations not prevented, by its topology from turning into a νµ or ντ , we
require the inequalities

Similarly, because we are assuming that the νµ and/or the ντ are inhibited by their topology
from turning into a νe, we require the inequality

Equations (10) and (11), together with the requirement that all rows and columns of the
matrix M in (7) and (9) sum to unity (i.e., a+ 2b = b+ 2c = 1), further leads to the following
inequalities

(

Moreover, since a + 2b = b + 2c, the arithmetic mean of a and b is c, i.e., (a + b)/2 = c,
which means that c lies half-way between a and b. Hence, the matrix elements a, b and c
are subject to the combined inequalities

a > c > b > 0.

(13)

Equations (9), (12) and (13), together with items A), B) and C) above, constitute the
proposed topological constraints on the matrix M. It happens that these constraints on M
are very restrictive. In particular, we will show in the next section (See also Appendix B)
that these constraints, together with the assumption that sin2 δ
= 0 (i.e., CP
violation is not maximal), admit of only one solution for M!

4.0 Determination of the Matrix M

When the proposed topological constraints of Section 3.0 are applied to the conventional
description of neutrino mixing (2), the matrix M in (6), (7) and (9), is uniquely determined.
To see how this happens consider the following time-average probabilities (See Appendix B
for details)

According to the proposed topological constraints of Section 3.0, these two time-average
probabilities must be term-wise equal, and nonzero. These requirements place three con-

To summarize, the proposed (qualitative) topological constraints on the matrix M (See Sec.

namely, (s2

sumed), which in turn result in a unique quantitative determination of the matrix M (See
Eq. 28).

5.0 Topology-Maintaining and Topology-Changing In-

Not only is the matrix M in (28) a unique solution to the proposed topological constraints
of Section 3.0 with sin2 δ

may eventually help reveal the deeper dynamical signiﬁcance of this matrix. Note that (6),
(9), and (28) have the very special property

Now this equality looks very much like an “equilibrium” condition between those under-
lying physical inﬂuences that would act to change the νe topology (quantum ﬂuctuations),
and those underlying physical inﬂuences that would act to maintain the νe topology (e.g.,
energy “barriers”).

Therefore, when PC = PN C we discover that the joint probability P = PC ·

PN C is
a maximum, namely, it characterizes some most probable condition or “state.” And, this
of course is the very essence of an “equilibrium” condition [7]. However, it must be un-
derstood that this hypothetical (long-distance) “equilibrium” between topology-changing,
and topology-maintaining physical inﬂuences, is only a (cumulative) result of deeper, and
largely unknown (short-distance), dynamical processes in the vacuum, which ﬁrst begin to
act on neutrinos at their source—thereby, eventually establishing the equilibrium condition
PC = PN C—on time scales very much shorter than the time it takes for the time-dependent
oscillations in neutrino mixtures to “damp out.” This is an essential requirement if these
hypothetical short-distance processes are to be responsible for “selecting” the (constant)
U-matrix mixing parameters prior to neutrino mixing.

Finally, while the unique nature of (28) has been demonstrated, and while we see that
this result seems to be closely connected with (short-distance) physical processes involving
topological constraints that select the neutrino mixing parameters, it is also clear that we do
not possess a ﬁrst-principles formulation of these ideas. As such, they are only promising
conjectures.

6.0 Conclusions

Topological constraints could play a major role in determining the nature of neutrino mix-
tures. Given that the νe and (νµ or ντ ) neutrino ﬂavors have distinct topologies, and assum-
ing that topology changes are suppressed in neutrino-neutrino transitions, while neutrino-
neutrino transitions without topology-change are relatively enhanced—one easily determines
both the form of the matrix describing long-distance neutrino mixtures, and uniquely deter-
mines the numerical magnitudes of the individual matrix elements. If the predicted matrix

9

(28), is eventually veriﬁed by observations of neutrinos from distant astronomical sources
(e.g., supernovae), and/or in long-baseline terrestrial experiments, this will provide qualita-
tive support for the new description of fundamental fermions, which requires, among other
things, that the νe and (νµ or ντ ) neutrino ﬂavors start, and end, “life” as topologically
distinct quantum objects (See Appendix A and Refs. 3–5). However, while experiments
could certainly falsify (28), (9), (12) and (13), together with items A), B) and C) in Sec-
tion 3.0, and the assumption [15, 16] that CP violation is not maximal (i.e., sin2 δ
= 1 or
cos2 δ
= 0), experimental veriﬁcation of these things would not conﬁrm the proposed topo-
logical constraints of Section 3.0. A much better theoretical understanding of the dynamical
signiﬁcance (if any) of the new 2-space description of quarks and leptons will be required be-
fore one can be conﬁdent that, if veriﬁed, (28) really is a reﬂection of underlying topological
constraints [18].

Appendix A. A new Internal 2-Space Description of Quarks and
Leptons

A.1 Background

In spite of the many successes of the standard model of particle physics, the observed pro-
liferation of matter-ﬁelds, in the form of “replicated” generations or families, is a major
unsolved problem. In [3, 19 and 20] a new organizing principle for fundamental fermions
was proposed, i.e., a minimalistic “extension” of the standard model based, in part, on the
Cayley-Hamilton theorem for matrices. To introduce (internal) global degrees of freedom
that are capable of distinguishing all observed ﬂavors, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem was
used to generalize the familiar standard-model concept of scalar fermion-numbers f (i.e.,
fm = +1 for all fermions and fa =
1 for all antifermions). This theorem states that every
(square) matrix satisﬁes its characteristic equation. Hence, if fm and fa are taken to be
the eigenvalues of some real matrix F (a “generalized fermion number”), it follows from this
theorem that both f and F are square-roots of unity. Assuming further that the components
of both F and its eigenvectors are global charge-like quantum observables, and that F “acts”
on a (real) internal vector 2-space, both the form of F and the 2-space metric are determined.
One ﬁnds that the 2-space has a non-Euclidean or “Lorentzian” metric, and that various
associated 2-scalars serve as global ﬂavor-deﬁning “charges,” which can be identiﬁed with
Lorentz 4-scalar charges such as strangeness, charm, baryon and lepton numbers.

−

Because these global charges are essentially the global charges associated with the so-
called “accidental symmetries” of the Lagrangian describing strong and electroweak interac-
tions [19–21], they can be used to describe individual ﬂavors (i.e., ﬂavor eigenstates), ﬂavor
doublets and families. Moreover, because of the aforementioned non-Euclidean constraints,
and certain standard-model constraints, one ﬁnds that these global charges are eﬀectively
“quantized” in such a way that families are replicated. Finally, because these same con-
straints dictate that there are only a limited number of values these charges can assume, one
ﬁnds that families, and their associated neutrinos, always come in “threes.”

A.2 Representing Flavor Eigenstates

The eigenvectors Q of F (i.e., FQ = f Q where f is the scalar fermion-number), together with
certain pairs of linearly independent vectors (U and V) that resolve Q (i.e., Q = U + V),
namely, various non-Euclidean vector “triads” (Q, U, V)—these are the analogs of Euclidean
triangles—serve to represent ﬂavor-doublets in terms of a pair of quark or lepton ﬂavor-
eigenstates as follows:

A.3 Topology of Vector Triads

When we refer to the “topology” of a particular neutrino ﬂavor-eigenstate (e.g., the νe),
we are referring to the topology of the corresponding vector triad (Q, U, V) with respect
to the internal transformation F. And, because F generates the M¨obius group Z2 (i.e.,
F2 = I2), those vector triads that are left unchanged by F, and by the identity F2 = I2,
[i.e., symbolically F(v)(Q, U, V)
(Q, U, V)], have the (abstract) topology of a cylinder,
(Q, U, V)], but obviously
while vector triads that are changed by F [i.e., F(v)(Q, U, V)
not changed by the identity F2 = I2, have the (abstract) topology of a M¨obius strip. And,
as it turns out, the neutrino ﬂavor νe (νµ or ντ ) corresponds to a vector triad having the
topology of a cylinder (M¨obius strip) with respect to F. See the qualifying remarks in the
next section.

A.4 Qualifying Remarks

With the possible exception of one family, all quarks and leptons within a given family are
found to exhibit the same topology with respect to F. This is certainly the case for the ﬁrst and
third families. And, because of these facts, together with the requirement of quark-lepton
“universality,” at least within any given family, we naturally expect this to be the case for
the second family as well. It happens that the second-family c and s quarks exhibit M¨obius
topology with respect to F. However, strictly speaking, the second-family leptons, namely,
the muon and its associated neutrino (and associated antiparticles) exhibit the requisite
M¨obius topology only if the components of the associated V-vectors are not exactly zero (See
p. 57, and Tables II and IV in Ref. 3 where the muon V-vectors, which are functions of the
strong-color multiplicity Mc, are shown to be V
1). Therefore,
if we wish to maintain a kind of quark-lepton “universality” within families, the V-vector
components associated with muons, though very small, must be nonzero. And, according to
the 2-space mathematical description of V-vectors, this is always the case whenever Mc

It has been shown (See Ref. 3, pp. 52–55) that the quark and lepton electric charges are

where the 2-vectors U, V are appropriate to a description of leptons. According to the 2-
space description, Q and V are both functions of Mc, while U is not. Only in the case of
the muons (µ− and νµ) with Mc ≡
U
0. In this limiting case,
the vector triad (Q, U, V) does not possess the requisite second-family M¨obius topology.
In fact, it transforms under F like a cylinder. So, a way to insure that V
= 0, which lies
completely within the context of the existing 2-space mathematical description, is to treat
Mc as a continuous variable, and let Mc closely approach, but never actually equal one in
(A5), (A6), and (A7) while maintaining U =
= 0, which leads to
the requisite second-family M¨obius topology for the vector triad (Q, U, V), and hence the νµ
neutrino. Of course, when Mc
1, neutrinos, including the νµ, would carry an inﬁnitesimal
electric charge q′
0. However, from a “practical” physical standpoint this is not a serious
problem because q′
2(f ) can always be made arbitrarily small, while always maintaining the
requisite second-family M¨obius topology of the vector triad associated with the νµ neutrino.
It is clear from the foregoing discussion that the current mathematical and physical de-
scription of the 2-space is simply not “robust” enough to demonstrate, without a doubt,
that V
= 0 for the νµ neutrino. Nevertheless, for various reasons outlined at the beginning
of this subsection (A.4), and because of the foregoing mathematical justiﬁcation, we will
assume throughout this paper that this is indeed the case, and that, as a consequence, the
vector triad associated with the νµ neutrino does possess the requisite second-family M¨obius
topology with respect to F.

A.4.2 Topological inﬂuences in quark mixing.

As described above, all quarks and leptons within a given family exhibit the same topology
with respect to the internal transformation F. However, as described in [8], owing to the
uncertainty principle, and the relatively large mass diﬀerences between quarks, mixing among
the d, s, b quarks (inside quark composites) is not expected to be controlled by topology.
By contrast, νe, νµ, ντ neutrino mixing is expected to be controlled by topology, owing to
the small value, and near degeneracy, of neutrino masses.

The standard description of three-ﬂavor neutrino mixtures [10, 11] involves a CKM-like
unitary matrix Uαi that transforms mass eigenstates νi = (ν1, ν2, ν3) into ﬂavor eigenstates
(νe, νµ, ντ ) as follows (See Eqs. 1 and 2 in the main text)

Using this formulation one can calculate the time-dependent probability Pνα→νβ that a neu-
trino of some deﬁnite ﬂavor α (at “birth”) will transform into a neutrino of a generally
diﬀerent ﬂavor β, upon detection. The result is (3) in the main text.

At suﬃciently great distances from the source of neutrinos, the time-dependent part of

(3) “damps out,” and we are left with the time-independent or time-average probability

Phase Transitions in O(2) and O(3) Models”, arXiv:hep-ph/9901296. Analogous examples
of ﬂuctuation-induced topology-change in macroscopic objects (e.g., destruction of topo-
logical objects due to thermal ﬂuctuations at phase transitions) abounds. For example,
otherwise persistent (“conserved”) topological defects in crystals can be destroyed by raising
the temperature suﬃciently (i.e., by melting the crystal). Similarly, otherwise persistent
(“conserved”) magnetic ﬂux-tubes in Type II superconductors and/or vortices in a super-
ﬂuid, can both be destroyed by raising the temperature above the critical temperature Tc.
And, conversely, topological defects are always created when such macroscopic systems ﬁrst
condense (or crystallize) as the temperature is lowered. We imagine that something roughly
similar can happen when quantum-ﬂuctuations (vacuum ﬂuctuations) act on otherwise very
similar quantum objects (i.e., same electric charge, spin, lepton number, and nearly identical
mass) that also happen to start “life” as topologically-distinct quantum objects. That is, we
are assuming that, if not prevented by some absolute conservation law, transitions between
such states (e.g., νe and ντ neutrinos) will be catalyzed by quantum ﬂuctuations.

establish the following very general principle:

In physical systems characterized by a well deﬁned topology, topology-change tends to be

suppressed, relative to the condition of topology-maintenance.

The basis for this principle is that topology change involves either an energy “expense” (an
energy “barrier” must be overcome) or a violation of some “topological charge” conservation

law, or both. In general, we expect this principle to apply to any discontinuous operation such
as the abstract equivalent of “tearing,” and subsequently “glueing” surfaces back together to
form states with new topologies. For example, one cannot continuously deform a doughnut
into a sphere. It must ﬁrst be “cut” and “glued” back together in a new way to achieve such
a transformation.

Now, given the “facts” regarding the topology of neutrinos with respect to the (abstract)
internal transformation F, and assuming that there are no “energy barriers” associated with
transitions between neutrinos having the same topology, the foregoing principle suggests that
these facts could have the following dynamical signiﬁcance:
Topology change in neutrino-neutrino transitions (να →

νβ) is suppressed by topological
energy and/or topological charge “barriers,” while topology maintenance in neutrino-neutrino
transitions is relatively enhanced.

It should be emphasized that even though the νµ and ντ neutrinos have the same topology
with respect to F, they are quite distinct in other respects. For example, in conventional
weak decays or weak capture reactions involving these particles, mu- and tau- numbers are
separately conserved.

Fourth Family of Quarks and Leptons, First International Symposium, edited by: D. B.
Cline and Amarjit Soni, Annals of The New York Academy of Sciences, New York, New
York, Volume 518, 1987, p. 190. According to the scheme described in Appendix A of the
present paper, the fundamental fermions d, νe(s, b, νµ, ντ ) have the topology of a cylinder
(M¨obius strip) with respect to the internal transformation F. Hence, we imagine that if,
in some imaginary world, quark couplings to the Higgs mass-producing ﬁelds were nearly
“switched oﬀ,” the resulting “low” mass d, s and b quark mixtures (located inside quark
composites) could conceivably look very much like the νe, νµ and ντ low mass neutrino
mixtures—owing to topological inﬂuences of exactly the kind proposed in the present paper.
In particular, in this imaginary world, we would expect the s and b quarks (like the νµ and
ντ neutrinos, respectively) to exhibit bimaximal mixing. However, because of uncertainty-
principle considerations, and because the b quark mass is, in the “real” world, very much
larger than the d and s quark masses, very little mixing with the b quark occurs in d, s, b
quark mixtures in spite of topological inﬂuences that would tend to encourage this. Thus, in

19

the case of strongly-interacting quarks, it seems very likely that topological constraints of
the kind considered in the present paper can, at most, play a minor role in determining such
things as CKM-type matrix elements. For example, in the case of d and s quarks, Gronau
shows that the mixing angle θc depends on quark masses since the matrix element V12, and
the d, s quark masses md and ms, respectively, are known to be empirically related via V12 =
sin θc =
= 0. This is nothing like the corresponding matrix element
for νe and νµ neutrinos found in the present paper. Thus, although a detailed understanding
of these matters is far from being achieved, it appears that topological inﬂuences are allowed
to play a major role in neutrino, but not in quark mixing, because of the small value, and
near degeneracy of neutrino masses in comparison to the very large diﬀerences between d, s
and b quark masses.

[9] Although conventional treatments of neutrino mixing do not involve topological consid-

because we argue that a neutrino with a deﬁnite ﬂavor also has a deﬁnite topology, here-
inafter we will often use these terms together as in “ . . . neutrinos have a deﬁnite ﬂavor and
topology.”

the formalism involved in neutrino mixing, the reader should be cautioned that there are

violating processes (e.g., neutrinoless double beta decay) are known from experiment to be
strongly suppressed, the issue of whether neutrinos are Dirac particles or Majorana parti-
cles need not be addressed in the present paper. However, it should be understood that if
neutrinos are Majorana particles, lepton-number violating processes would be possible (if
not probable!), and the matrix Uαi in Eqs. (1) and (2) in the main text would have to be
multiplied by a diagonal matrix such as

[13] By deﬁnition, mixing does not occur at the source of neutrinos. Hence, Eq. (4) in the
main text is obviously true. For example, at the source, neutrinos are pure ﬂavor eigenstates

demonstrate the validity of Eq. (4) for at least one matrix element, starting with Eq. (3) in

[14] The proposed topological constraints are of course assumed. We imagine that they are
to be justiﬁed by physics at some deeper level than the conventional description of neutrino
mixing. While we have no way to prove these qualitative assumptions regarding topological
constraints, their adoption certainly leads to testable predictions regarding mixing parame-
ters, and the matrix of time-average probabilities

[15] E. Rodriguez-Jauregui, “Implications of Maximal Jarlskog Invariant and Maximal CP-
Violation,” arXiv: hep-ph/0104092. While the author of this reference argues that maximal
CP-violation may occur in both the quark and lepton sectors, these arguments do not seem
to be compelling. Instead, I ﬁnd it necessary in the present paper to assume the contrary,
namely, that CP-violation is not maximal, at least in the lepton sector.

According to Eqs. (20) and (B52) in the present paper, the topological constraints of
Section 3.0 have forged a kind of “linkage” between the mixing angle θ1, and the angle δ
associated with the Dirac-type CP-noninvariant phase factor eiδ, namely,

1 cos2 δ = 0.
c2

Even though we do not know the physical origin of CP-noninvariance, it is clear that if we
make what seems to be a reasonable assumption, namely, that CP-violation is not maximal
(e.g., δ is not equal to
= 0, in
which case θ1 will be constrained by c2

2 ), δ will be subject to the constraint sin2 δ

= 1 or cos2 δ

1 = 0 or c1 = 0.

±

In this case, Eq. (2) yields, for example (Use s1 = 1)

But, the topological constraints of Section 3.0 have also yielded the constraint c2
which means that (For the sake of argument assume θ3 is a ﬁrst-quadrant angle)

Clearly, this last equation describes “bi-maximal” mixing of the mass eigenstates ν2 and ν3.

[16] H. Georgi and S. L. Glashow, “Neutrinos on Earth and in the Heavens,” arXiv:hep-
ph/9808293, and hep-ph/9808293v2, page 5, Eq. (20). It is interesting, and probably sig-
niﬁcant that Georgi and Glashow independently arrived at Eq. (28) in the main text of the
present paper starting from six experimental neutrino “facts,” some of which are completely
diﬀerent than the facts and assumptions employed in the present paper. In particular, these
authors began by assuming

23

1. There are just three chiral neutrino states having Majorana masses.

2. Atmospheric neutrinos rarely oscillate into electron neutrinos.

3. Atmospheric muon neutrinos suﬀer maximal, or nearly maximal, two ﬂavor oscillations

into tau neutrinos.

4. & 5. Two experimentally (and theoretically) motivated assumptions regarding the order of
magnitude of individual neutrino masses, and various mass squared diﬀerences.

and

6. Neutrinoless double beta decay probably does not occur.

Given these six “facts” these authors derived both the neutrino mass matrix, and partially
determined the associated CKM-like unitary matrix U, which describes neutrino mixtures.
From U they then derived Eq. (28) in the present paper. In closing, these authors also noted
that CP-violation in this situation could be “superweak.” Clearly, this would be consistent
with the assumption in the present paper that CP-violation is not maximal, i.e., sin2 δ
= 1
or cos2 δ

= 0.

While the present approach, and that of Georgi and Glashow in deriving Eq. (28), are
quite diﬀerent they are, nevertheless, expected to be compatible. In particular, we anticipate
that such things as neutrino masses and mixing parameters, ultimately owe their existence to
physics at a deeper level, where topological considerations, of the kind proposed in the present
paper, are expected to play an important role.

[17] Note that for all practical purposes, time-dependent quantum probabilities Pνα→νβ be-
come time-average or classical probabilities
when t is suﬃciently large. For this
h
reason, it makes sense to consider classical probability measures such as the “joint” proba-
bility P = PCPN C, where PC and PN C are time-averages of quantum probabilities.

Pνα→νβ i

[18] Even if the matrix M in Eq. (28) in the main text is veriﬁed by experiment, we could
not be certain that the constraints expressed by Eqs. (9), (12) and (13), together with items
A), B) and C) in Section 3.0, are topological constraints related to the 2-space description
of quarks and leptons. There are three basic reasons for this assertion.

First, we do not know why the topology of vector triads (with respect to the internal
transformation F) should be relevant to neutrino mixing. Second, we do not have any
detailed understanding of the hypothetical mechanism that supplies the “energy barriers”
or “topological charge conservation laws” that serve to inhibit topology change in neutrino
mixing. Third, as indicated in Appendix A (Sec. A.4), we cannot be absolutely certain that
the νµ neutrino has the requisite second-family M¨obius topology with respect to F.

What we do know with certainty is that, regardless of their physical origins, the con-

straints of Section 3.0, together with the additional assumption sin2 δ
deﬁnitely determine M uniquely.

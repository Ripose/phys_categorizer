Abstract

In part III is realized the consistent development of Heisenberg—Dyson’s two-
layer matrix approximation to the graph formalism for postulating discrete
physical objects (DPO) introduced in parts I–II in the form of discrete sets of
graphs—skeleton (SvT) or root (RvT) v-trees, beyond common space—time.
It is noted that already in the late-1950s one made an attempt to formulate
in physical theory the discontinuity as an element of some special diagram
technique. In the framework of pointed Heisenberg—Dyson’s two-layer ma-
trix scheme, with an incidence I and a loop CD(δ) graph matrices, are got
the following main results: (1) the many-“planes” SvT or RvT representa-
tion of any DPO in opposition to one-“plane” physical objects in continuous
physical models; (2) the superposition of diﬀerent types of interaction for any
microobject where RvT representation for short-ranged interactions (weak,
strong) is one-“plane” and for long-ranged interactions (gravitational, elec-
tromagnetic) is many-“planes”; (3) based on the incidence matrix I (upper
layer) “graph geometry” of real DPO describes their peculiar many-“planes”
inner structure beyond common space—time; (4) the notion of interacting
“charge” can be extracted only from the symbolical quantities for the quasi-
continuous ﬁeld “objects” by means of the loop matrix CD(α) (under layer);
(5) the set up strong correlation between upper (discrete material objects)
and under (quasi-continuous ﬁeld “objects”) layers of full two-layer matrix,
with the help of Maxwell’s equations, may be eliminated in the frame of
DPO conception, by the way of transition to the “universal linearity” be-
yond space—time; (6) the problems of a stability (reproduction) of station-
ary states, of a transition itself (“jump”) of electron and of a sudden emission
(“production”) of photon in atoms are solved directly for stable atomic shell
system in many-“planes” RvT representation including its permanent repro-
duction with non-open “transferability” between “graph isomers”; (7) the
possibility of a “fatigue” of atomic shell system is discussed; (8) the introduc-
tion of “true discontinuity” for structural discrete microobjects (instead of
“QN-discontinuity” from quantum mechanics) and the realization of the “top
hierarchy” with a superposition sum of Riemann’s “counting homogeneous el-
ements” for RvTs of constituent parts and a creation of (r, s) — subsequences

peculiarities of DPO.

1 INTRODUCTION

According to Dyson’s opinion in well-known paper (Ref. [1]) — see also Ref. [2] — the

correct fundamental theories will be developing only after twentieth century.

1.1 Heisenberg—Dyson’s analysis of Maxwell theory

At the same time Dyson (Ref.

[1]) as well as Heisenberg (Ref.

[3]) were set up that
in the broadest sense a central idea of Maxwell theory, how it is considering now, can be
formulated as a conception of the two-layer structure of nature. In the under more deep
layer we have the electromagnetic ﬁelds, peculiar “objects” with simple wave equation’s
description, and in the upper layer we can observe the real material objects, their energy
and forces. The symbolical ﬁeld quantities for so-called “objects” from an under layer such as
electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths, the main continuous quantities in Maxwell’s equations,
are the purely mathematical abstractions (for a given case see particularly the special Weyl’s
investigation in Ref.
[4]) and for this reason can be determined only through their energy
and forces in an upper layer.

In general these results are true for the same continuous quantities of any other ﬁelds
that on the whole give rise to an unsound situation which will alter completely only by the
transition to a new mathematical description of the basic real physical objects taking into
account a possible their discontinuity and a probable changing of the existed correlation
between under and upper layers (see especially the foundation papers of Maxwell, Einstein
and Bohr in Refs. [5–7]).

1.2 On the new fundamental theories

Indeed therefore one can consider the possibility of any concrete realization of the in-
dicated perspective Heisenberg—Dyson’s conception of two-layer physics (see Refs.
[1, 3])
with new adequate mathematical description of the basic real physical objects, including
both discrete (predominantly) and continuous ones, as a steppingstone toward the cardinal
changes of competing contemporary fundamental theories — the quantum ﬁeld theory, the
S-matrix theory, the group theory (see, for example, Ref. [8]) — and also toward the most
natural propositions on the initial principles for future fundamental theories, all the more
that an introduction of some accepted in the present-day physics principles was done to a
great extent “by hands”. From these new principles above all one must call — besides a dis-
continuity — a hierarchy (a subjection and a consubjection), a reproduction (an immediate
or an intermediate mechanism), an integrity of discrete physical object and its non-reducing
as a whole to the sum of parts (a correlation of the whole and its quasi-autonomic parts),
a replication (an evolution of structures with one or many hierarchical centres), a non-
overcumulation (particularly, in graph vertices, analogously to an equation of continuity),

2

and so on, as distinct from earlier evident primary principles of an inertia, a stability, a space
— time extension, a superposition, etc., and also derivative principles of an equilibrium, a
homogeneity and an isotropy of any space, a symmetry, etc.

Once more it is necessary to emphasize that the creating fundamental theories with ordi-
nary continuous physical objects and with postulated discrete (or quasi-continuous) physical
objects are the antipodes which mutually cannot serve as an justiﬁcation of one for another
that is pointed out yet in Introduction (section 1) to part I of paper and especially in Intro-
duction (subsection 1.1) to part II of paper, in agreement with the Riemann’s postulates.
As it is noted by Dirac (see Ref.
[9]): “there will have to be some new development that
is quite unexpected, that we cannot make a guess about, which will take us still further
from classical ideas. . . But if we cannot ﬁnd such a way . . . we simply have to take into
account that we are at a transitional stage and that perhaps it is quite impossible to get a
satisfactory picture for this stage”.

1.3 Graph kinematics for postulating discrete physical
objects beyond space — time

Let us return to parts I–II of paper (see Refs. [10–11]) where it is described a graph kine-
matics of some postulating discrete physical objects as the one of possible ways to realization
of such two-layer physics conception. For a full physical process graph, including subgraphs
of separate fragments of the structural physical objects, is introduced the universal, beyond
space—time, formalism based on the special two-layer matrix

M(δ) =

I
CD(δ)

,

(1)

(cid:27)

(cid:26)
where δ ≡ ω, α, . . . , etc., composed from an incidence I and a loop CD(δ) graph ma-
trices. This adequate mathematical formalism, in agreement with the above-mentioned
[1, 3]), allows to represent any real dis-
Heisenberg—Dyson’s two-layer scheme (see Refs.
crete physical object and each derivative quasi-continuous ﬁeld “object”. Furthermore it
could be led to the concrete analysis of the basic notions and quantities, in accordance with
structural peculiarities of these objects, and to the following their interpretation. In spite of
the limited number of non-oriented or oriented graph parameters, namely v and n = v − 1
in particular case of non-directed or directed v-trees, there are just enough possibilities for
determination of the diﬀerent characteristics of everyone from the pointed objects only by
the way of various graph vertices conﬁgurations, i. e. we obtain factually a speciﬁc graph
method for description of the real discrete physical objects including their interactions in
physical processes of all kinds.

Practically from parts I and II of paper we have already in the framework of appropriate
aspects of the graph theory for non-directed as well as for directed trees technique (initiated
by Kirchhoﬀ)

— a “graph geometry” for the real discrete physical objects, described their structure by
(upper layer) with the proper skeleton or root trees

means of an incidence matrix

(v−1×n)

basis where v is a number of vertices and n is a number of lines (“edges”) of corresponding
non-oriented (v, n) — graph,

— an “extremal equilibrium” condition for the symbolical quantities of quasi-continuous
ﬁeld “objects” as complex systems, described all-round by means of a loop matrix
(δ) (under layer) corresponding to the l diﬀerent independent loops of suitable

(l×n)
oriented (v, n) — graph with the same proper skeleton or root trees basis.

· D
(n×n)

Below, beginning from section 2, we will go on a development of postulated earlier graph

kinematics formalism.

A simplicity of the graph mathematics, caused apparently by the rejection from the
“Extension learning” (die Ausdehnungslehre) in the frame of generally accepted notion of
space—time and by the transition to a new conception with the natural insertion of so-called
“Binding learning” (die Verbindungslehre) already beyond space—time in old understand-
ing, may be demonstrated with the help of the essentially linear principles including the
linear principle of superposition in graph technique and the corresponding additional lin-
ear principles of a “non-overcumulation” in graph vertices and a “cyclic stability” along
independent graph loops.

1.4 On a possible evolution of dimensional symmetry
in the physicist’s picture of nature

The transition from an old mathematical scheme to the graph kinematics formalism
beyond space—time does not exclude the dimensions problem. It will emerge also in the
following introduction of the new fundamental physical theories.

However, according to Dirac’s conclusion in due time (see Ref. [9]), then obtained results
within the framework of space—time consideration had inevitably led us to doubt how
fundamental the four-dimensional requirement in physics is: “A few decades ago it seemed
quite certain that one had to express the whole of physics in four-dimensional form. But
now it seems that four-dimensional symmetry is not of such overriding importance, since
the description of nature sometimes gets simpliﬁed when one departs from it”.
In this
connection, if already a picture of nature with four dimensions, after the pass from a picture
of nature with three dimensions, is not completely symmetrical, one can formulate the next
very general propositions:

1. it is apparently a false direction of development of theoretical models with a progressive
increase of dimensions as follows from an above-noted not quite perfect four-dimensional
symmetry (see Ref. [9]),

2. it is probably a non-adequate way of postulating of the “fractals” or ﬁnding of the
more hidden types of dimensional symmetry as a key physical notions for new theoretical
models, particularly in case of microphysics,

3. ﬁnally, taking into account 1. and 2., one must simply postulate an absence of common

space—time, at least in microworld.

Obviously this last conclusion 3. corresponds to an initiate assumption of this paper.
It is important to note also that graph is topologically an one-dimensional simplicial
complex or a linear complex which consists from vertices (points) and “edges” (lines) (see,
for example, Ref. [12]).

2 MICROWORLD PHYSICS IN THE FRAME OF GRAPH
KINEMATICS FORMALISM

The extraordinary complicated main subject of microworld physics has been forming by
quantum theory for the past almost 100 years. However the essential successes in a solution
of this immensely hard problem of the quantum theory came only with the discovery of
quantum mechanics.

2.1 Dyson’s analysis of quantum mechanics and discrete
microobjects problem

According to Dyson’s conclusion (see Ref.

[1]) a central idea of quantum mechanics,
again in the broadest sense, can be realized by an extension to microworld of the two-layer
structure conception as it was occured already for Maxwell theory. At that the proposition
about two-layer construction of the nature in quantum mechanics leads us, as a next step, to
the general physical theory, classical as well as quantum, which is more consistent, realistic
and universal itself than a former one.

In the under layer we have now the electric, magnetic and other ﬁelds with their strengths
and in addition the mathematical abstractions of the same kind, namely the wave functions
which describe a behaviour of diﬀerent microobjects. In the upper layer besides the energy
and forces of any real objects there appear the probabilities of occurrence of various events.
Thus we come factually to an uniﬁed two-layer picture for Maxwell’s theory and quantum
mechanics, at least roughly. Nevertheless there are lots of distinctions in details between a
classical electromagnetism picture and a behaviour of microobject; all the more the latter
has an enough inexact or inaccurate deﬁnition itself. Apparently all microobjects must
be discrete and therefore could be described generally by means of a special mathematical
formalism which is to follow from the speciﬁc microworld conditions expressing the primary
principles of discontinuity.

On the other hand, in part I of paper (see Ref. [10]) it is assumed that one can choose,
in particular, the transition itself to microworld physics as an optimum stage for postulating
of the discrete physical microobjects in a form of the new “physical graphs”. On this
assumption one must use the old Feynman diagram technique as a starting point in frame of
the S-matrix theory, which intense-investigated earlier (see Ref. [8] and references in [10])
together with the ﬁeld theory and the group theory.

Just in those years Landau (see Ref. [13, 2]) had ﬁxed that the speciﬁc diagram technique
for determination of singularities in the quantum ﬁeld theory quantities is really beyond a
formalism of this theory. Taking into account a non-equivalence of such “old” diagram
technique, based only on the stable microobjects — both “simple” and “complex”, to a
perturbation theory, Landau had decided that solely a straight use of diagram technique is
completely consistent and under such estimation we should make factually the ﬁrst steps
to successive development of a “new” diagram technique which is the generalization of an
“old” one. It is very likely that this “new” diagram technique itself could serve, according to
Landau, as a ground for an adequate future fundamental theory. To a certain extent similar
put forward hypothesis one must take also into consideration at least as an initiate attempt
to do without the customary continuous physical theory.

2.2 General survey of two-layer conception in microphysics
and deterministic picture problem

Owing to the set up uniformity of a possible realization of two-layer conception in macro-
physics (Maxwell’s theory) as well as in microphysics (quantum mechanics) we can carry
out the following typical speciﬁcation of the graph kinematics formalism (see subsection 1.3)
ﬁrst of all in an area of investigation of the discrete microobjects (or their discrete parts)
which appear inevitably in this theoretical scheme. Without going into details one can note
that for every separate discrete microobject, from the whole physical system of microob-
jects, an incidence matrix I in (1) gives as usually a representation of its inner structure
(or inner structure of its discrete parts) on the base of the non-directed root trees vertices
conﬁguration, while a loop matrix CD(α) in (1) reﬂects the loop-forming quasi-continuous
ﬁeld “object” produced by a “fusion” of several discrete parts of microobjects together or,
more exactly, by a corresponding superposition of their directed root trees vertices with con-
servation of the total number of lines (“edges”). For example, in a case of the most evident
forecast of “fusion” or vertex-corresponding superposition of two leptons e− and e+ as the
discrete microobjects, having an elementary form of two-side directed root (v=2)-trees:

✲r❡

r (e−) and ✛r❡

r (e+),

( 2a)

one may create a photon hν or the simplest quasi-continuous ﬁeld “object”, having a form
of oriented multigraph—semicycle:
✲
✛ r (hν) with v = 2, l = 1.

( 2b)

r❡

In general, it is signiﬁcant that a transformation of non-oriented graphs into oriented
ones within the framework of a developing graph formalism is carried out with the help of
a doubling — operation consisted in a substitution of every or separate non-directed line
(“edge”) by a cycle pair of opposite directed lines (“edges”) (see, for example, Ch. 1 in [19]),
analogous to above—represented in (2b) oriented multigraph — semicycle of photon.

Additionally, in connection with obtained results it will be noted that an ordinary de-
scription of microobjects in contemporary general quantum theory of ﬁelds and particles by
means of the probability distributions for continuous quantities in a space—time become
apparently insuﬃcient in a case of the graph kinematics scheme beyond space—time, with a
reliable direct “count” for evident discrete quantities (homogeneous elements) in elementary
physical processes. Perhaps the mere fact that this giving up of determinacy has been a
very controversial subject, which is due certainly to quantum theory and some physicists
(Einstein especially) do not like it at all, shows simply a non-adequacy of the picture of
nature in the inﬁnitesimal to the space—time basis notions.

In some or other way, a today’s “continuous” picture of microworld with probability
description of microobjects in a space—time, which had always taken for granted, will be
changed radically under the more obvious ways of a transition to the graph kinematics
formalism beyond space—time for the doubtless discrete microobjects.

2.3 Basic graph characteristics for microobjects
and Ulam’s hypothesis.

Awaring the importance of studying of the main properties of graphs, and especially trees,
which could serve as a basic tool for description of microobjects within the graph kinematics,
we pass to the consideration of a set of concrete graph characteristics for microobjects and
special hypotheses from the graph theory.

Beforehand one must introduce for graph G with v vertices the power of vertex vi

M(vi) ≡ Mi

(3)

i. e. a number of components for graph Gi=G–vi. According to Ulam’s hypothesis in
[12]) for a case v >3 one takes place the reconstruction
Harary’s interpretation (see Ref.
(or, more exactly, the reproduction) of a graph G from a collection of subgraphs Gi=G—
[14]). But
vi. The proof of Ulam’s hypothesis for trees had presented by Kelly (see Ref.
later the Kelly’s result had generalized by Harary and Palmer (see Ref.
[15]) and at last
had improved by Bondy (see Ref.
[16]). Starting from propositions of Ulam’s hypothesis,
these authors had proved a possibility of the reconstruction (the reproduction) of a tree T
from a collection of subtrees Ti=T—vi where vi are the terminal (Harary, Palmer) or the
peripheral (Bondy) vertices; for the latter an eccentricity

(4a)

(4b)

(5)

where u — any vertex of T, is equal to a diameter of T

eT (vi) = dmax(u, vi),

DT = max
(vi)

eT (vi); i = 1, 2, . . . , v.

These convenient formulations of Ulam’s hypothesis for trees can be put forward as the
initial theorems for a graph consideration of stable and quasi—stable physical systems in
microworld. Additionally it will be noted also that for trees the power of vertex vi is equal
to its degree

M(vi) = degvi.

F ) with vR=1, vc

F = v −1, v = vR +vF = 1+vc

Taking into account that we separate from the all trees only the root v-trees (RvT) with
one detached root vertex (vR) from a total number of vertices v (see section 3 in part II, Ref.
[11]) one can thereby determine the most “chief” RvT which includes only “core” vertices
(vR) and (vc
F ) = 1 and
characterizes the pure “core” of discrete microobject. Here solely one vertex (vR) possesses
the maximal power MR ≡ Mmax(vR) = v − 1 whereas the other v —1 vertices (vc
F ) of “core”
have the minimal power Mmin(vc
F )=1. At ﬁrst sight it is seemed that, owing to maximal
value of the power MR for a single root vertex (vR) in the pure “core”, just this “chief”
RvT reﬀects the principal inner structure of corresponding discrete microobject, as it were
its “genetics”, and the properties of its various interactions with the another microobjects.
Probably the rest RvTs represent mainly the peculiarities of a constitution of diﬀerent
microworld systems and their typical reactions.

F , dmin(vR, vF ) ≡ d(vR, vc

2.4 About four sorts of “charge” in old concept

At last going over to an interpretation of the main microobject’s graph characteristics,
corresponding in the ﬁrst place to “charges”, it is important to emphasize that an appearance
of these notions in a new graph formalism may be connected with some diﬃculties, especially
if we follow a logic of independent introduction of the primary oriented graph notions.

First of all, with a view to avoid any misunderstanding, we pay attention again to an
above—concerned problem of a setting up of the characteristics of symbolical quantities
for a quasi-continuous ﬁeld “objects”, in a form of some multigraphs, in comparison with
the ones for continuous ﬁeld. In the framework of an old concept, a continuous ﬁeld itself
acquired physical reality in a space—time, and an interaction of microobjects had to be
described usually with the help of an intermediate, conditionally real, “ﬁeld of force”. It
turned out that the properties of microobjects with respect to an exchange interaction with
similar, conditionally real, “ﬁeld of force” had to be determined by a single parameter —
so-called the speciﬁc “charge” of microobjects, which initially must be diﬀerent for the case
of various “ﬁelds of force”.

In very such a way one set up the four known fundamental interactions whose distinc-
tions had to be explained by multiple exchange mechanisms as well as by intensity of these
exchanges (proportional to corresponding “charges”) into a “microobject — ﬁeld” system in
conventional space—time, or more exactly, in the presence of common metric characteristics
of space—time.

On the other hand, just at the like approach it is easy to come to the conclusion that
the most speciﬁc peculiarity of an old concept concerning the fact of an existence only
four possible sorts of “charge” (that is also in a formal agreement with the conclusion of
Hurwitz’s theorem about four basic kinds of hypercomplex numbers (four extraordinary
algebras — see Ref. [17])) may be inconsistent with the proposals, immanent construction
and general principles of graph kinematics formalism. It is necessary to bear in mind that
an inner structure of microobject has to be included into an incidence matrix
that

I
(v−1×n)

is realized as a “graph geometry” for the discrete microobject. However the usual “ﬁeld’s
characteristics of interaction” one must determine with the help of a loop matrix CD(α)
i. e. a “charge” or an interaction “charge” has to be extracted from the new loop-forming
quasi-continuous ﬁeld “objects”.

2.5 What is now a “charge” for?

Indeed, due to the absence of the main notions of an old concept and in exchange for a
continuous, conditionally real, ﬁeld and an interaction of microobjects with corresponding
intermediate “ﬁeld of force” in space—time, these new ﬁeld “objects” can be represented
beyond space—time as the oriented multigraphs with some loops which are composed from
two or more directed RvTs. At that in a given case we have no parameters of interaction
for microobjects but there are the original “fusion” or vertex—corresponding superposition
processes already for vertices of the initial directed RvTs and the resulting oriented multi-
graphs from which one can extract a notion of the graph equivalent of something having a
likeness with the “charge”.

8

2.5.1 Symbolical quantities for loop-forming quasi-continuous
ﬁeld “objects” as oriented multigraphs

In developing formalism every microobject may be represented integrally as a set of
RvTs i. e. as a whole which consists in a hierarchical order from many quasi-autonomous
parts — independent “planes” generating a complicated “graph geometry” of structural
microobject. Of course, an appearance of other physical characteristics of this microobject
may be provided only for special symbolical quantities following from a consideration of
corresponding quasi-continuous ﬁeld “object”.

If one can write down the various symbolical quantities for the loop-forming quasi-
continuous ﬁeld “objects” in a form depending from diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the ori-
ented multigraph vertices then the problem of an interaction “charge” interpretation will
be reduced to an analysis of deﬁnite procedures, including a graph reproduction of discrete
microobjects, a recombination of “core”-vertices or any reconstruction of corresponding mi-
croobject graphs (non-directed and directed RvTs and oriented multigraphs) using partic-
ularly the results of an application of Ulam’s hypothesis. Later we will continue this graph
approach by investigation of some concrete examples.

As above, the symbolical quantities for quasi-continuous ﬁeld “objects” are derived from
an “extremal equilibrium” condition with the help of a loop matrix CD(α). In addition, it
is notable however that there exists a “mechanical” version of interpretation of an analogous
“extremal conditions” along l = n − v + 1 loops for an old Feynman diagram (see Ref. [13])
which earlier was discussed by Coleman and Norton (see Ref. [18]). These authors were
shown that l “extremal conditions” are equivalent to the condition that the relevant Feynman
diagram be interpretable as a picture of an energy — and momentum — conserving process
occuring in space—time, with all internal microobjects real, on the mass shell, and moving
forward in time, for just the correct distances and times to “tie together” the entire directed
graph. The Feynman parameters αi (i = 1, 2, . . . n), associated with n internal lines of
this graph (see 4-momenta qi in subsection 1.2 of part I), were identiﬁed with the time
microobject exists between collisions, divided by its mass.

Thus, at a time taking into account this evident “mechanical” picture of the continuous
microobjects interaction in space—time, on the one hand, and assuming an “invisible” sepa-
rate photon as the elementary quasi-continuous ﬁeld “object” (a simple oriented multigraph
in (2b) accounted for electromagnetic interaction) beyond space—time, on the other hand,
one can admit also the another quasi-continuous ﬁeld “objects” which are represented as
the various oriented multigraphs, reﬂected the diﬀerent interaction processes and the fur-
ther procedures of decay reconstruction and exchange reaction mechanisms, with the use of
initial discrete microobjects beyond space—time. Perhaps in such a way we could solve the
problem of a microobject “charge”.

Nevertheless it will be noted that instead of various types of ﬁelds and interactions with
diﬀerent “charges” of microobjects in conventional space—time, we have now an uniﬁed
RvT — description where the diﬀerent quasi-continuous ﬁeld “objects” may be distinguished
beyond space—time solely by the sets of vertices in oriented multigraphs (composed from
directed RvTs), their conﬁgurations and corresponding powers. From an old concept one
must remember still that each vertex interaction could occur as an instantaneous event in
space—time.

2.5.2 Graph equivalent of microobject “charge”
and decoding of symbolical quantities

Returning to Heisenberg—Dyson’s analysis of Maxwell theory (see subsection 1.1) one
can go on the decoding of the symbolical quantities for the loop-forming quasi-continuous
ﬁeld “objects” but keeping in view also a possible existence of some prototypes in an old
concept for a sought graph equivalent. This problem may be solved, in particular, with the
help of a preliminary consideration and an analysis of Dirac’s assumption (Ref. [9]) about
a picture of “discrete (quantized) Faraday lines of force”, each associated with an electric
charge (−e or +e). Starting from an old idea that the Faraday lines of force with continuous
distribution are a way of picturing electric ﬁelds and going over to quantum theory, Dirac
brought a kind of discreteness into a classical picture and replaced it by just a whole number
of discrete lines of force with no lines of force between them. These lines of force in the
Faraday picture end where there are charges (for lines of force extending to inﬁnity, of
course, there is no charge) and we shall have an explanation of why charges always occur in
multiples of one elementary unit, e, and why does one not have a continuous distribution
of charge occuring in nature. Some of these lines of force, forming closed loops or simply
extending from minus inﬁnity to inﬁnity, will correspond to waves; others will have ends
with the charges. The breaking of a line of force would be the picture for the creation of an
electron e− and a positron e+. One can consider also a picture of the discrete lines of force
as “strings”, and then the electron in the picture is the end of a “string”.

Dirac’s picture of “discrete Faraday lines of force” (or, perhaps, a picture of some
“strings”), demonstrated an existence of the elementary units — constants — of discrete
charges, in general diﬀerent, may be used in our case (see (2a)) for the setting up, analo-
gously, an evident graph equivalent for an elementary “charge” (a simplest directed RvT)
as well as for corresponding an elementary “inertial mass” (a simplest non-directed RvT)
of microobject. In subsection 3.2 of part I we have already a graph deﬁnition of an “inertial
mass” me for an electron in a form of the simplest non-directed RvT with v=2 (Tv=2=1).
Thus one may postulate the ﬁrst (v = 2, n = 1) — graph deﬁnitions for “charges” e− and
e+ and “inertial mass” me

✲r❡

r (e−)

✛r❡

r (e+)

r❡

r (me)

( 6 )

Naturally, the “gravitational mass” or scalar “gravitational charge” has a graph equivalent
also in a form of the simplest directed RvT as well as the other scalar “charges”: g1 ≡ e
(above—mentioned), g2 ≡ GW , g3 ≡ gS.

Obviously, these introduced graph equivalents could contain also the another character-
istics of discrete microobject besides a “charge” and an “inertial mass”, for example a “spin”
(later we revert to this problem).

Still for a clarity of an accepted approximation in direction of the decoding of a meaning
of every symbolical quantity which describes the quasi-continuous ﬁeld “objects” in the
framework of an oriented graph technique, one must take into consideration a deﬁnite set of
loop combinations — in accordance with a loop matrix CD(α) from (1) — of the diﬀerent
graph equivalents, included in corresponding graph representation of the various physical
processes (decays, collisions, scattering, reactions, etc.) as a rule with the conservation of
a total number of lines (“edges”) that is carried out by the use of the vertex-corresponding

10

superposition.

2.6 Superposition of diﬀerent types of interaction

The most unexpected feature of a developing new physical graph technique is a possible
“parallel” presence of the four (and more) diﬀerent sorts of interaction “charges” all over
for any microobject and for its symbolical quantities. All these interaction “charges” have
the uniﬁc graph representation in a form of the various subsets from the full sets of vertices
(vi) in corresponding RvTs for a given microobject. Similar full sets of vertices (vi) can
be distinguished mainly by their disposition towards a “core” of RvT and, of course, by
their powers M (vi), especially into a “core”, and every interaction “charge” may occur in
multiples of one elementary “unit” presented by some number of RvT’s “core” vertices of
diﬀerent powers. In other words, if we accept such concept, the deﬁnite disposition of these
vertices in a “core” subset and some combination of their powers must be responsible for a
concrete interaction “charge”.

On the other hand, taking into consideration that certain physical processes would be
arisen out of an existence of ﬁxed interaction “charges”, one can specify in such a way
the diﬀerent interaction “charges” of a single microobject. Thus we have a criterion of
identiﬁcation of the diﬀerent interaction “charges” of microobject on the base of a typical
classiﬁcation of various elementary physical processes. It is easy to see also that one cannot
study the “charges” at rest as well as the corresponding forces between them and the ﬁelds
associated with them; in other words we haven’t a “charge” statics but there is only a
so-called “charge” dynamics.

Many-“planes” representation of any microobject as a set of non-directed or directed
RvTs with a superposition of the diﬀerent sorts of interaction “charges”, for the ﬁrst time
mentioned in subsection 2.5.1, arranges now in Tables 1–3 where are introduced also some
“graph—vacancies” like CvF for further ﬁlling at vF =2÷4 and an additional physically stable
graph—compositions from several known microobjects.

First of all in Table 1 we repeat (see above (2a), (2b), (6)) a collection of the graph
equivalents of microobject’s masses, interaction “charges” and their annihilation in a form
of the symplest non-oriented and oriented (v=2, n=2) — graphs (with lmax=1, nmax =
v − 1 + lmax=2) which are accompanied by the diverse graph matrices (see Ref. [19]).

what elucidates an use of evident “mechanical” version of interpretation of the “extremal
equilibrium” condition (see again a subsection 2.5.1) and allows to set up a form of the
“source expression” for an extraction of the interaction “charge” notion (corresponding to
the “ﬁeld’s characteristic of interaction” in an old concept).

Shortly before a concrete analysis of the superposition of diﬀerent interactions on the
basis of RvTs at v > 9 for practically all subnuclear microobjects (because according to
Table 2 in part II of paper (see Ref. [11]) there is factually a full spectrum of these microob-
jects at v > 9) we make allowance also for some physically stable RvT — compositions
(quantum systems) and several “graph—vacancies” (for unknown physical microobjects) as
an exception. Toward this end in view we take into account at the ﬁrst place a disposi-
tion and a power of pure “core” vertices in corresponding RvTs. At best one may begin
from the simplest pure “core”, which is characterized by minimum distance from root vertex
(vR): d(vR, vc
F ), again in a form of non-directed
(v = 2) — RvT for “me” (“core” CvF =1) or directed (v = 2) — RvT for “e±” indicated in
Table 1. However it is more interesting to consider in such a way the following RvTs, all
over with a pure “core” separately, which correspond to an interval v = 3 ÷ 8 i. e. to a re-
gion of atomic and nuclear stable (shell) systems: see Table 1 in Part II of paper (Ref. [11]).
Below Table 2 contains in some detail only the ﬁrst part of a pointed interval, namely an
interval v = 3 ÷ 5 for the non-directed RvTs.

One must mention still the second part of a pointed interval, namely a rest interval
66v68, which includes the further analogous RvT — compositions for atomic and nuclear
quantum (nQN , lQN ) — systems up to a case v=8, Tv=8=115 (corresponding to a magic
number for protons in nuclear shells) and also at v=6 and v=7 for two light u- and d-quarks
from (1,0)-subsequence (see next section 2.8, Table 5).

At last from the very beginning of a consideration of the superposition of diﬀerent types
of interaction it is necessary to lay emphasis again on a possibility of existence of every
interaction for any microobject. Owing to this orientation we can formulate a comprehensive
superposition problem particularly for a concrete microobject at v=11 with Tv=1842 (see
below Table 3). Nevertheless, if we assume that in a general case the full Tv-set of non-
directed and directed microobject RvT s, at a given number of vertices v, is responsible
for an all types of microobject interaction then naturally to introduce a division of Tv-set
on the corresponding RvT-subsets: every of these RvT-subsets describes a deﬁnite type

15

of interaction. In other words, diﬀerent RvTs or diﬀerent subsets of RvT from a full Tv-
set of microobject RvT s represent the concrete sorts of interaction “charge”. An essential
role in the distribution and arrangement of various RvT s among the diﬀerent interactions
of speciﬁc microobject may be attributed to the properties of corresponding RvT s “core”
within which for every “free” — terminal — vertex (vc
F ) a distance from root vertex (vR) is
equal to 1 and none of these vertices, adding in root vertex, can be “seen” in isolation i. e.
we have a peculiar “invisible “core” vertices conﬁnement” into RvT s (analogously with a
“quark conﬁnement” hypothesis).

First of all one must separate from a full Tv-set of RvT s only the pure “core” RvT s with
Mc
max=2(v–1) and compare them with some suitable interactions. Most probably that on
the basis of the pure “core” RvT s, due to “vertices conﬁnement”, may be described namely
the short-ranged or “contact” types of interaction, i. e. strong and weak (with “breaking”)
interactions which operate at very short range inside the corresponding microobject. In other
words, we have in this case an entirely “microworld situation” in which must ﬁgure only
typical discrete microobjects with “invisible “core” vertices conﬁnement”.

On the other hand, gravitational and electromagnetic interactions are long-ranged and
generally macroscopic (in space—time the strength of like force falls oﬀ with the square of the
distance between the interacting micro-, meso- and macroobjects). At that one takes place
a transition from “microworld situation”, reﬂected by the pure “core” RvT s, to “mixed or
pure macroworld situation” where at ﬁrst one or several RvT-vertices, beyond a “core”, get
“visible” and therefore one arises the “deconﬁnement” of still more number of RvT-vertices,
determined a construction of corresponding stable physical systems (see, for example, shell
systems of atoms and nuclei in Table 2), their decays and reactions providing with the
Ulam’s hypothesis.

It is interesting that for ν e-represented CvF =2 an incidence matrix

Thus, in the framework of many-“planes” RvT—representation of every known inter-
action of microobjects one occur some typical RvT—compositions with diﬀerent sets of
“free”—terminal—vertices (vF ), so-called “hedgehogs”. Characteristically, that the short-
ranged interactions, as against the long-ranged ones, can be described by a single “hedge-
hog” — RvT i. e. for this case there is an one-“plane” RvT — representation which must
reﬂect at the same time a “compact” inner structure of microobject in respect to a given
interaction. On the contrary, in a case of the long-ranged interactions there are many “hedge-
hogs” — RvTs determined to a large degree “transparent” inner structure of corresponding
physical systems having also many-“planes” RvT — representation. Such “transparent”

18

inner structure can be considered as an adequate hierarchical scheme of levels or “orbitals”
with the diﬀerent sets of “hedgehog” — RvT (for this aspect see also the Table 2 and the
following section 2.7).

It is noteworthy that a superposition of four (or more) types of interaction occurs here
necessarily as a result of the compulsory “stratiﬁcation” of a corresponding set of “hedge-
hogs” — RvT s. Only after the superposition of diﬀerent types of interaction one can regard
wholly any microobject with many-“planes” “hedgehog” — RvT representation, that must
naturally solve the problem of the whole and the parts within the framework of an immanent
construction of many-“charge” microobject.

However,

in this connection it is signiﬁcant to emphasize that a central problem of
contemporary uniﬁed — ﬁeld theory, that would relate the electromagnetic, gravitational,
strong, and weak interactions in one set of equations and no like solution has yet been
found (some progress has been made in the uniﬁcation of the electromagnetic and weak
interactions), now transforms to the completely new problem of decoding and interpretation
of a many-“charge” discrete microobject as an indivisible set of “stratiﬁcation planes” in
the frame of a “hedgehog” — RvT formalism.

2.7 Atomic events in the new graph kinematics formalism

As it was emphasized by Bohr and Einstein in due time (see Heisenberg’s statement in
Ref. [20]) a stability of atom means a permanent reproduction (an immediate mechanism)
of the same stationary forms or steady states in the framework of which

— according to Bohr’s postulates, we have an electron moving about in certain orbit of
atom and occasionally making a jump from one orbit to another; in agreement with Bohr—
Heisenberg’s opinion (see Refs. [20, 21]) it is impossible to describe similar jump in the old
notions as a discrete process in space—time,

— following to quantum mechanics, we have in atoms the so-called “orbitals” i. e. the
regions of space where it is not possible to give a deﬁnite path for an electron but only a
probability distribution or an electric charge distribution (averaged over time) around the
nucleus; one strong Einstein’s objection(see again Refs. [20, 21]) consists in the opposition
of this conclusion to the real paths of electrons in the Wilson cloud chamber.

It is known that both very diﬀerent and naturally interconnected aspects of these phe-
nomena, reﬂected the unexpected stability (a reproduction of the same steady states) and
the evident discontinuity (an electron jump between orbits) of atomic system dynamics, are
presented mathematically in contemporary quantum mechanics of atom which allows

— to calculate the discrete energy levels of stationary states,
— to take into account an inexplicable stability of the “orbitals” or the deﬁnite stationary
states which are distinguished one from another in respect of their shapes and each could
be reproduced formally again and again,

— to estimate a probability of the sudden emission of photon as a result of the discrete

transition between stationary states.

Nevertheless, according to Einstein (see Ref.

[20]) in spite of these doubtless achieve-
ments, many problems, especially the problem of a transition itself between stationary states
(without regard for the real path of electrons) and the problem of a sudden emission (or

19

“production”) of discrete photon, originated as the results of an analysis of the purely dis-
continuous atomic events, haven’t any satisfactory explanation in quantum mechanics and
demand the more accurate description. Unfortunately, it is easy to set up that de facto
these old unresolved, but clearly formulated principal problems of quantum mechanics were
thrown oﬀ at the stage of a branching of fundamental physical theory in a middle of the
twentieth century in favour of some alternative variants of development that lie now into
the mainstream of current research.

This dead end for similar comprehensive conceptual problems give rise to the many in-
appropriate latent diﬃculties in some new developing physical models including the widely
known divergence diﬃculties. Therefore it is very notable that similar discontinuous events
may be described immediately on the base of graph formalism for discrete atomic systems
beyond space—time. Indeed, the unconditional introduction of a such discrete graph tech-
nique provides for the various subnuclear microobjects some single sets of the concrete RvT
s at a given v with the aim of a determination of their masses, directly proportional to
Tv — numbers or their fractional (r, s) — “fragments” Tv/2r3s. While a structure of the
stable atomic and nuclear shell (many-level) systems can be described certainly with the
help of the several sets of RvT s corresponding already to the diﬀerent number of vertices
v and thereby to the diﬀerent principal quantum numbers nQN = v − 2. At that in every
RvT these v vertices must have a deﬁnite disposition which additionally may be presented
in some alternative conﬁgurations, producing the “graph isomers” with the same number
of vertices (vi) but the diﬀerent values of their powers Mi (identical to their degrees or
valencies, according to (3) and (5)).

Naturally the so-called “valence-isomerism” will be realized by means of the partitions
(see Ref.
[12]) and their representative trees i. e. RvT s. Factually, the realizability of a
set of integers (in spite of “fractals”) as degrees of the vertices of a speciﬁc RvT with the
detachment of a root vertex (vR) and a “core” can be illustrated par example on the next
partitions for (v = 5, n = 4) — RvT from Table 2 (with the completeness — number on
the left):

8=(1+2)+2+2+1
8=(1+2)+3+1+1
8=(1+3)+2+1+1
8=(2+2+1)+2+1

8=(1+4)+1+1+1
8=(2+2+2)+1+1
8=(2+3+1)+1+1
8=(3+2+1+1)+1

8=(4+1+1+1+1).

Here we apply on the base of (5) a known theorem about the tree-realization of the partitions
(see Refs. [12, 19]):

2n ≡ 2(v − 1) =

degvi ≡

M(vi).

(7)

v

i=1
X

v

i=1
X

The complex of RvT s in Table 2 is responsible, in particular, for a three-level shell system
with the principal quantum number nQN = v − 2, equal to 1, 2 and 3, and with the
corresponding possible values for the orbital quantum number lQN :0, 1 and 2.

Then an above-pointed “valence-isomerism” reﬂects a many-“planes” representation of
the like hierarchical shell systems as atoms and nuclei (several RvT — sets) that is sim-
ply an expression of their stability. Therefore just the simultaneous or “parallel” presence

20

of all “planes” or stationary forms of any stable shell system in RvT’s description means
its permanent reproduction by the way of non-open “transferability” between “graph iso-
mers” with the same number of vertices. Thus one obtains an adequate interpretation of
the RvT — representation of steady states for every shell system where may be taken into
account additionally a possible appearance of the degenerate levels. Still more it seems very
signiﬁcant also that the indicated RvT — representation is congruous with the correspond-
ing one in Table 1 which describes the real path of free electron, particularly in the Wilson
cloud chamber (beyond atom).

2.7.1 Graph schemes for elementary processes

Now the transitions or “jumps” between such steady states of the shell systems become
absolutely evident as occuring with an exchange of lines in their RvTs and corresponding
oriented multigraphs. They take place in the next concrete examples which can be consid-
ered by the special “graph schemes” or “graph equations” for various atomic and nuclear
elementary processes.

The graph scheme for an emission of photon by atom with jump down of electron contains
the loss of one of the peripheral vertex (vp) in pointed below suitable RvT from a collection
of subtrees T–vp, corresponding to Bondy’s condition

eT (vp) = DT

In (9) neutral atom with v − 1 vertices can be reconstructed by means of an use of Ulam’s
hypothesis (according to Bondy) for T–vp up to initial neutral atom with v vertices cor-
responding to T. At that we have a production of photon with an emergence of the root
vertex and a photon “core” formation (in the hν — semicycle form).

It is easy to understand that an use of the directed RvTs for describing of concrete
processes with the charged microobjects instead of the non-directed ones for an estimation
of microobject masses may be carried out by the way of a treatment of the totally or partially
enumerative RvTs i. e. RvTs already with marked vertices (in particular, with (vp) —
vertex in graph scheme (9)). Naturally, in any single case we have a conservation of the total
number of non-directed and cycle paar of opposite directed lines for enumerative RvTs in
these graph schemes; all over there are balanced signed digraphs.

The graph scheme for an absorption of photon by atom with jump up of electron contains
the result of an insertion of the photon’s hν — semicycle into the peripheral vertex (vp)

emission back again of an “electron — RvT”.

2.7.2 About so-called atomic system “fatigue”

At last an eﬃcient consideration of similar graph schemes—or graph equations — for
any typical microobject, having as a rule the shell structure (with a presence of the sets
of quantum numbers), can be carried out only on condition that one taking into account
an obligatory “isomerism” in the complex RvT — representation of every compound mi-
croobject — system and additionally a many - value variety of every graph scheme with
participation of corresponding interacting reagents (photons, electrons, etc.)

Obviously, that it is very naturally for a like situation to suppose a possibility of the

various failures in a complicated RvT — representation of the composite microsystems.

In this connection, one may arise with some probability a speciﬁc shell system “fatigue”,
including particularly a “fatigue” of an atomic system with steady state sets, which can
be appeared perhaps in result of some default of a peripheral part of the “graph isomers”,
for example after an emission of photon and suitable reconstruction of atom (see graph
equation (9)), i. e.
in spite of an assertion of Ulam’s hypothesis, or in result of some
transformation of this peripheral part into the balanced signed semiwalk of excited atom
already, in particular by an absorption of photon (see graph equation (10)). Thus one
may probably create an accidental situation of non-full reproduction of atom (in spite of
an experimentally line spectra of excited atoms and ions with enough strict invariability),

22

connected straightly with many - “planes” RvT — representation of atomic system, which
will cause the combinatorial failure after a some number of the like regular and even cyclic
processes.

Analogous failure can be occured also at the photoelectric eﬀect in atom (see graph equa-
tion (11)) and generally in every graph scheme with shell structure of the main “fatigueless”
microobject where ﬁgures the many - “planes” RvT — description.

2.8 Mass-classiﬁcation of subnuclear microobjects
and (r, s)-subsequences

Among the chaos of the experimental mass values (M/me)exp [X] (in me unit, with
Tv=2 = 1 for electron) of “initial” and “excited” subnuclear microobjects [X] in Table 2 of
part II of paper (see Ref. [11]) may be traced the several basic (r, s) — subsequences along
with a number of “chief ” microobjects at r = s = 0 corresponding to the pions [π0] and [π±]
(v = 9, Tv=9 = 286), to the N — baryons—just proton [p] and neutron [n] — and some light
unﬂavored and strange mesons (v = 11, Tv=11 = 1842), to the charmed baryons [Λ+
c ], [Σc],
[Ξ+
c] and a series of mesons and baryons (v = 12, Tv=12 = 4766) and, probably,
to the d — quark (v = 6, Tv=6 = 20). Of course, the indicated “chief” microobjects at
r = s = 0 can be described completely by the above-mentioned sets of “hedgehog” — RvT.
At ﬁrst we have in Table 4 one of such (r, s) — subsequences, namely, the main (0,2)-
subsequence of lepton masses, where two known leptons disposed at v = 11 ([µ]) and v = 14
([τ ]), and of meson and charmed meson masses — at v = 13 ([ρ], [ω]) and v = 14 ([D0],
[D±], [D±

c ], [Ξ0

c], [Ω0

s ]).

It will be noted that baryon [Λ0] belongs also to (1,1)-subsequence at v = 13 whereas

These particular varieties of (r, s)-subsequences to a certain degree remind the group
combinations — “conglomerates” or multiplets of particles from a more sophisticated “nu-
merology” in the framework of special well-known formalism based on the symmetry princi-
ple with a common interpretation. In our case a notion of “multiplet of particles” arises from
a natural analysis simply of “ 1
3-part” of the “whole”, for example Tv, and is regu-
lated alternatively by the hierarchical rules of a double- and a triple-splitting mechanism for
the “hedgehogs” — RvTs on a base of the evident recurrent inequalities for Tv (see particu-
larly in section 4 of part II of paper — Ref. [11]). Thus the “doubleness” (“doubletness”) as
well as the “tripleness” (“tripletness”) are simply a result of use of the “hedgehog” — RvT
formalism for a representation of the discrete microobjects as the fundamental constituents
of all the matter in the universe.

2-part” or “ 1

Under any realization of this “doubletness”—“tripletness” graph concept one must set up
the various possibilities and lastly some deﬁnite rules for a more exact practical estimation
of mass parameters of the discrete microobjects along with a rough approach to Tv and its
fractions Tv/2r3s in part II of paper (see Ref. [11]).

At ﬁrst, starting from the recurrent inequalities for Tv in a form

(12)

one can determine an “interval-function” ∆ (Tv) which allows to calculate for every v the
distribution range of Tv-values (see below Table 8).

Thus in Tables 4–7 we have an essentially original “concentration” of the whole sets
of particle group masses, with “mixing” of meson and baryon particle categories, near the
deﬁnite number of vertices (especially within an interval v=11÷14) of corresponding “hedge-
hogs” — RvT s which in various conﬁgurations are responsible for the structural peculiarity
of diﬀerent microobjects and in such a way one can be set up their concrete physical char-
acteristics. In this connection one must elaborate for the developing graph formalism an
adequate graph interpretation which could allow to reproduce some general physical picture.
At that one can be taken into consideration: a) all above-stated graph (“hedgehog” — RvT)
regularities, pointed out as diﬀerent (r, s) — subsequences for microobject masses; b) the
further graph schemes (see, for example, equations (9)–(11)) for various atomic and nuclear
reactions with conservation as well as non-conservation of a number of vertices and, more-
over, c) also the developing group formations for other microobject characteristics, including
“charge”, “spin” and so on, that are in agreement with the studying graph formalism.

Table 8 indicates a sharp increase of ∆ (Tv)—values with v, in other words an enlarge-
ment of the possibility diapason for the “hedgehog” — RvT formalism in respect to a
description of mass parameters as well as of other characteristics of microobjects including
the heavy physical and further the complicated biological microobjects.

3 TWO-LAYER PHYSICS ACCORDING
TO HEISENBERG — DYSON

It still remains a mystery why the physicists were not among the ﬁrst investigators of a
graph aspect of Kirchhoﬀ’s work about an electric network of 1847 (see Ref. [22]) and are
enough indiﬀerent so far to the development of graph — or, more exactly, tree — theory
which now is a section of the discrete mathematics wide-using in applied sciences. Appar-
ently, such passivity occurs as a result of the full hegemony of the continuous mathematics
in physics and correspondingly the preferable construction of the so-called one-“plane” con-
tinuous models, in opposition to the initially many-“planes” discrete models how it is easy
to see from the above-pointed examples of the discrete mathematics application. Therefore
a break-through in “discontinuity” didn’t happen before in physics.

26

3.1 Peculiarities of microobjects description
in Heisenberg—Dyson’s physics

Up till now through a development of the continuous physical models, based on the
methods of corresponding sections of a continuous mathematics, the most part of an ap-
propriate concept notions can be included in a contemporary theoretical representation of
natural events and can be used as a base for an introducing any new model. However after
the transition to microworld many conceptual conclusions, following from the pointed con-
tinuous models, have turned out experimentally prooﬂess and even senseless that is due to
some earlier included concept notions which haven’t adequate interpretation.

Among such non-adequate notions in old concept one may call artiﬁcial quasi-objects
like the quarks, although similar quasi-objects can be predicted as the certain (r, s) —
subsequences in the framework of a proposed graph formalism for discrete microobjects in
a “hedgehog” — RvT representation (see section 2). Indeed, in Tables 5–7 one comes to
light a “multiplet” from ﬁve quarks in (1,0) — subsequence: Tv/2 at v=6 ([u] — “up”), v=7
([d] — “down”), v=10 ([s] — “strange”), v=12 ([c] — “charm”), v=17 ([t] — “top”) and
an alternative “doublet” from (2, 1) — subsequence: Tv/12 at v=12 ([s] — “strange”) and
v=14 ([c] — “charm”). Besides these main subsequences for the fundamental constituents
in an old concept one must mention in passing some other kind of “doublet” from the quarks
at one value of v=14:[c] — “charm” from (2,1) — subsequence (Tv/12) and [b] — “beauty”
or “bottom” from (2,0) — subsequence (Tv/4).

In this arisen consideration it is noteworthy also the creation of a new “top hierarchy”
of particles with a distinct separation of the “chief” particles, including the pions and the
N — baryons (at r=s=0), and the main leptons in (0,2) — subsequence, whereas any other
categories of particles may be interpreted as the following, possibly “derivative”, layers of
such “top hierarchy”. Here it is important to emphasize also that in quantum mechanics one
can set up only a peculiar discontinuity of dynamical quantities — depending from the sets
of quantum numbers — for physical microobjects but we haven’t yet a straight quantum
description of their discrete complicated structure and, still more, of their many-“planes”
representation beyond space—time.

Meanwhile an existing problem of description of the microobjects structure and their
interactions beyond space—time is solved above (in section 2) in the framework of linear
two-layer aproach or two-layer matrix (1) (at δ ≡ α) approximation by means of the specially
introduced notions of the “graph geometry” in a linear “hedgehog” — RvT representation
and the linear loop-forming quasi-continuous ﬁeld “object” as an oriented multigraph with
some loops (composed linearly from two or more “hedgehogs” — RvT s responsible for
separate discrete microobjects). Just in this way one can occur the linear two-layer physics
of microworld according to Heisenberg—Dyson with an inclusion of the new essential features
of atomic and nuclear stable systems and subnuclear particles.

3.2 Macro networks in Heisenberg—Dyson’s physics

On the other hand, Heisenberg—Dyson’s physics of macroworld coincides with
Kirchhoﬀ—Maxwell’s two-layer physics approach, formulated in part I of paper (see Ref.
[10]) and constructed on the two-layer matrix (1) at δ ≡ ω with skeleton trees basis. By

27

using of such skeleton trees basis one can write down the all possible solutions for various
macro networks, as a some graph prototype of any macroobject. In the main, the linear
equations, derived from two-layer matrix representation, allow to set up the linear structure
of all fragments of any macro network i. e. the linear superposition of corresponding real
sets of SvT s, determined by famous Kirchhoﬀ’s theorem (see for example, Ref. [12]).

In this connection, including the total of subsection 3.1, it is immensely important to
note that on the whole a graph (tree) conception, appeared initially from the linear algebraic
Kirchhoﬀ’s laws (Ref. [22]) in the form of SvT — formalism, may be considered generally
as an one-value result of the “universal linearity” of physical laws of the nature. Although,
according to Ulam’s reminiscence, yet Fermi on this occasion said: “Well, it does not say in
the Bible that fundamental equations of physics must be linear”.

According to an originated problem of the creation of an initial pre-condition for ad-
equate graph description of macroworld it will be noted that any physical theory for the
consideration of diﬀerent discrete or quasi-continuous macroobjects can be constructed on a
base of the concrete simplest “geometrical ﬁgures” (in a general sense) taking into account
the main peculiarities of these natural macroobjects and giving a “native” representation
of their structure in the framework of existed models picture. These “geometrical ﬁgures”,
in other words, can be applied as a some physical image of the complex macro process
with a participation of macroobjects and, lastly, these ones must be transformed to the
corresponding equivalent graphs (trees) according to some macroworld rules, in agreement
with the Kirchhoﬀ’s rules and the corresponding macroworld principles.
In this way we
should have a generation of the graph prototype for macroobject as an analog of macro net-
work (compare, for example, the various “geometrical ﬁgures” for crystals, macromolecules,
biological objects, etc.).

It is remarkably in a development of the continuous physical theory for macroworld that
already at the stage of an appearance of the Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetic ﬁeld,
written down here in two-layer matrix form

one was carried out, with a a great virtuosity, the crossing over of the components of “charge”
(a known 4-vector) and the components of remaining “curl ﬁeld” part with ~E,

part

~D, ~H, ~B. As a result one could obtain then, without any transition to the discrete physical
objects conception, only a “mixed” picture that don’t allow to separate directly the upper
layer (discrete material objects) and the under layer (quasi-continuous ﬁeld “objects”) in the
framework of a proposed Heisenberg—Dyson’s two-layer matrix (1) scheme, right however for
the solutions of pointed equations (13). And, at last, starting from the Maxwell’s equations
in emptiness, one should mention the description of electromagnetic radiation where the
energy can be regarded as waves propagated through usual space requiring no supporting
medium: in this case ﬁgures only one under layer.

28

3.3 Heisenberg — Dyson’s two-layer approach to study
of microobjects structure

Returning again to microworld in the course of an analysis of the Heisenberg — Dyson’s
two-layer physics one must take active part ﬁrstly in the furhter decoding of the postulated
“physical graph” as a some derivative, already within discrete two-layer matrix scheme,
analog of a solution of the diﬀerential equations for continuous physical models. In other
words, while passing through a stage of the physical dynamics i. e. a stage of an investigation
of corresponding diﬀerential equation itself (with Newton’s, Lagrange’s, “evolution’s” and
other diﬀerential operators) in favour of a two-layer matrix approximation for its solution,
one can go over to a straightforward explanation of the structure and the properties of discrete
physical microobjects, without reference to dynamics aspects in space—time. Substantially,
a two-layer matrix approximation for pointed solution must be derived by the way of its
extremal transformation to the two-layer system of linear algebraic equations (for a natural
description of “physical graph”, as an analog of “Kirchhoﬀ’s laws graph”).

After RvT — estimation of the subnuclear microobject masses (an average error ranges
0 to 10 per cent) in part II of paper (see Ref. [11]) we obtain some rough mass-classiﬁcation
with the “concentration” of all microobject masses within an interval of RvT - vertices:
v = 9 ÷ 14, as an illustration of the enough adequacy of “hedgehog” — RvT formalism
to the clearing of microworld picture. Nevertheless, at the more accurate and complete
determination of the structure and the properties of discrete microobjects the leading role
must play their interactions (or interaction “charges” according to Table 3) and connected
with them diﬀerent “core” characteristics, including Mc, vc
F , CvF , as the main representants
of hierarchical sets of “hedgehog” — RvT.

However, formerly it is important to elucidate from the point of view of a “graph lan-
guage” (as an alternative “third language”) that the dynamical quantity, namely “E —
energy” provided for the continuous models (side by side with “L — Lagrangian”, “H —
Hamiltonian”, etc.) must be “measured” already with the help of dimensionally identical
parameter “c2” ([E]∼[c2]) giving a purely numerical — dimensionless — result for mass
m = E/c2. Indeed, according to the special theory of relativity the mass of microobject
is a measure of its total energy content that is equivalent in a “graph language” to the
dimensionless Tv — numbers or their fractional (r, s) — “fragments” Tv/2r3s and is, analo-
gously, in a some agreement with the known relation of two periods ω = 2π/T in a “wave
language”, i. e. the mathematical period 2π and the physical period T . Therefore, in the
case of subnuclear particles there are a sequence of integers Tv and fractions Tv/2r3s for
the straightforward determination of their masses using namely a “native” Tv - quantity of
“hedgehog” — RvT formalism.

Further, according to our consideration in subsection 2.6, it is signiﬁcant also that the
nature of any microobject mass cann’t be determined by one type of interaction inasmuch
as for any microobject there are simultaneously all types of interaction (four or more) which
determine conjointly a general (“mixed”) mass of every microobject and, consequently, of
any macroobject.

29

3.3.1 Responsibility of diﬀerent types of interaction
for complicated microobjects structure

F

F = vmax

A “hedgehog” — RvT representation for a single pure “core” of nucleons (n◦, p+) at
v = 11, i. e. CvF =10 with maximum “free” vertices vc
in Table 3, corresponds appar-
ently to a some set of free constituents — quarks which are responsible for an inner “invisi-
ble” structure of the strong interacting nucleons and, according to the quark—conﬁnement
hypothesis, cannot escape from one another (in QCD, particularly, interactions between
quarks get weaker or stronger as the space—time distance between them gets smaller or
greater, correspondingly). This unwarranted assumption about a role of the single pure
“core” CvF =10 for the strong interaction of a nucleon stipulates an introduction of the ad-
ditional suggestion that one of the “planes” in the “hedgehog” — RvT representation of a
nucleon can never be “seen”, even in isolation, and at that may be shown only by a some
indirect way. Such suggestion concides with a conclusion from section 2.6 about the “mi-
croworld situation” within which there is an “invisible “core”-vertices conﬁnement” for any
typical discrete microobject. It is easy to see, however, that a presence of the “charges”
altogether and quantum numbers in the single pure “core” of nucleons CvF =10 cannot re-
in our case a linear set of the
spond to an integer of the free constituents — quarks, i. e.
various quarks in nucleons in the form of superposition sum may be considered simply as a
special combinatorial factor for an estimation of the real composition of their “core”-vertices
(as opposed to compensation rules for the “charge” multiplets with a concrete, for example,
fractional electric charge assigned to the diﬀerent quarks).

The next single one-“plane” RvT — representation or “hedgehog” — RvT with vF =
vmax
F − 1 = 9, vc
F = 8, which is responsible for the weak interaction of nucleon in Table 3, on
the contrary is quite “visible” and takes part in the decays (for example, n◦ in Table 3) and
in the construction of the deﬁnite real physical systems (for example, nuclei from the sets of
separate n◦ and p+). Indeed in following Table 9 one depict the most evident typical graph
constructions of some light nuclei from the separate “hedgehogs” — RvTs of neutrons and
protons, within a general “core” with several root vertices. Over this “core” one must arrange
the sets of steady states, or one can potentially join the hierarchical schemes of corresponding
electronic shell levels controlled by electromagnetic — or other long-ranged — interaction,
with 1840 “hedgehogs” — RvTs for every nucleon (according to Table 3).

It is already known that positive “charge” of nucleus Z is determined by a number of
separate in-side directed lines beyond “core” connecting with a number of included into
“core” protons. These in-side directed lines emerge in the result of a dissolution of lines
in some oriented multigraphs (with semicycles for adequate single non-directed lines) which
must be disposed beyond the corresponding “core” and may be considered as if the “free
radicals” of nuclei with interacting “charges” (compare, analogously, the “free radicals” into
the like presentation of chemical or biological molecules). Obviously that additionally to
Table 9, a “core” of any next, more heavy, nuclei with Z>2 can be immediately constructed
in a similar manner.

It will be noted also that a like form of the “core” — structure of atomic nuclei, especially
in the region of enough large Z, presupposes a some possible “ﬁssion” process similar to the
biological cell “ﬁssion” according to the principle of replication as an evolution of structures
with several hierarchical centres.

3.3.2 “Fission” and “fusion” of “core”—vertices under formations
and structural changes of microobjects

Every type of interaction between various microobjects as a cause of their structural
changes may be realized by means of exchange forces resulting from the continued inter-
change of “transferable particles” (photons, mesons, gluons, intermediate bosons, etc.) in
a manner that bonds their hosts together. For example, it is suggested that in the strong
interaction gluons are exchanged between quarks or mesons are exchanged between nucle-
ons; at that mesons jumped from proton to neutron and back again. Also in a case of the
electromagnetic interaction there is the covalent bond involving electrons and so on.

On the other hand, all changes in the structure of every real, certainly complicated,
microobject, participating in diﬀerent physical processes (decays, collisions, scattering, pro-
ductions, reactions, etc.), are accompanied with a “ﬁssion” and a “fusion” of “core” —
vertices, including the corresponding root vertices, that may be interpreted as a reconstruc-
tion, a reproduction, a replication (or a multiplication), and so on, of “core” for varions
RvTs.

For concrete illustration from the very beginning it is expedient to consider the simplest
example of complex nucleon structure with the set of RvTs at v = 11 in which one must
embed all kinds of microobject with the sets of RvTs at v 6 11, namely in the form of

Nevertheless, a problem of the Riemann’s “counting homogeneous elements” in expres-
sion (14)–(15) can be solved only in the frame of evident discrete RvT — transforma-
tions embraced the necessary permutations of various “core”-vertices, after admissible oper-
ations of their “ﬁssion” and “fusion” and “core”-generating or “core”-eliminating processes,
and also specially the “invisible “core”-vertices conﬁnement” within the nucleon for “free-
walking” quark vertices (without root vertex). The last remark concerns two coeﬃcients k6
and k7 in (14).

It will be noted also that a former Yukawa’s suggestion about the exchange forces between
nucleons that held them together involved several generating pions which now, in expression
(14), are simply included as a graph constituent part of nucleon with the maintenance of the
principles of a graph integrity of nucleon and separately of pions (and any other particles),
of a graph non-reducing of nucleon as a whole to the sum of parts and, at last, of a graph
reproduction of nucleon.

The further study of the more complicated microobjects may be carried out analogously.
In general terms, under a penetration into the structure and a formation of the theo-
retical model characteristics of concrete microobject it is necessary to leave out its dynam-
ics and everyone from artiﬁcial symmetry multiplets, determined solely the non-structural
quasi-discontinuity of “conditional microobject” in a form of the discrete sets of quantum
numbers — so-called “QN-discontinuity” (with the following increase of these sets for the
classiﬁcation aims and an experimentally proof comparison). Just then one must essen-
tially alter former description starting from an introduction of the true discontinuity beyond
space—time (instead of “QN-discontinuity”) and a direct calculation of the precise proton
mass as an initial point of the “top hierarchy” consideration. As it is demonstrated already
such true discontinuity beyond space — time can arise only by an acceptance of the axiom
of the universal linearity of physical laws in macroworld as well as in microworld; at that
above-mentioned “top hierarchy” for microobjects is a natural consequence of the same lin-
earity.
Indeed, an initial principle of superposition in the framework of graph formalism
may be fulﬁled in the form of a sum of the Riemann’s “counting homogeneous elements”
including the “hedgehogs” — RvTs, the SvTs and the other graph “planes” of discrete
physical objects, correspondingly.

In the end, summing-up specially the main results of an attained two-layer physics ap-
proach to microworld it is easy to see that the set of RvTs determines the peculiarities
of the following many - ”planes” representations of real single microobjects and complex
microob- ject - systems:

32

-one strong interaction ”core” (one set of pure ”core” vertices) which is responsible
probably for the notion of ”Elementary Particle” or for some microobject corresponding
only to the set of ”invisible ”core” vertices”,

-one weak interaction ”core” (one set of ”core” vertices with separate vertex beyond
”core”) which is responsible for the decaying microoobjects - ”neutral” as well as ”charged”,
having the single ”visible” vertices beyond ”core”,

-several electromagnetic or gravitational interaction ”cores” (several sets of various ”core”
vertices with additional vertices beyond these ”cores”) which are responsible altogether for
diﬀerent shell microsystems.

Using the far-seeing propositions of Ulam’s hypothesis for graphs (see Ref.[12]), proved
later for trees (Refs.[14-16]), it will be noted that every tree (including everyone RvT) can
be completely presented as a some composition of respective subtrees with the same or less
number of vertices. Then any pure ”core” for microobject may be written down in the form
of superposition sum of some set of pure ”cores” for its constituent parts. Therefore, par-
ticularly, every ”Elementary Particle” can be decomposed as a ”whole” in the superposition
sum of Riemann’s ”counting homogeneous elements” as suitable separate ”parts” (perhaps
such transitions from one ”invisible” ”core” to the postulating Riemann’s sum of suitable
several ”invisible” ”cores” are typically for the strong interacting microobjects whereas if we
consider the weak interaction one must turn to an analysis of the decaying microobjects and
”visible” ”charge” reactions). On the other hand, this decomposition must reﬂect simultane-
ously a hierarchical non-reducing of the ”whole” to the set of ”parts” that may be connected
with the discretion of RvT-basis of”graph geometry” beyond space-time as opposed to the
usual bases in ”external” space-time with ”point-continuity” of coordinate axes (Cartesian
frame of reference, for example) which, however, deprive of personal character of discrete
physical microobject in corresponding theoretical models.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The proposed model of an introduction of the discrete physical objects in micro- as well as
in macrophysics is realized by means of postulating of the new “physical graph” as a discrete
microobject and simultaneously using the “Kirchhoﬀ’s laws graph” for an electric “macro
network”. These graphs may be presented through the discrete sets of root v-trees (RvT —
“hedgehog”) for microobjects and skeleton v-trees (SvT) for any typical macroobject i. e.
beyond space—time, inasmuch as the pointed sets of trees form in some way the RvT-
In this case the common “Extension axiom”
basis and the SvT-basis, correspondingly.
in a space—time is replaced by the more adequate “Binding axiom” beyond space—time.
The rejection from space—time agrees, on the other hand, with Eddington’s supposition
(see Ref.
[23]) that the space and the time are only the approximate notions which must
be substituted ﬁnally by the more general idea of an arrangement of any events of nature
with adapting of the more adequate mathematical formalism and getting accustomed to an
absence of generally accepted space—time.

If we are at the some stage where one should realize a discrete object scheme for the
description of physical microworld or, more generally, for the creation of an uniﬁed physical
theory of micro- as well as macroworld then again one may appear a “choice situation”
in part of a branching of the directions of development of physical theory (see Ref. [9]).

33

This “choice situation” is analogous to a similar one in the fundamental physical theories in
the mid-1960s (see, particularly, a narration about competition of the S-matrix theory, the
quantum ﬁeld theory and the group theory in Ref. [8]) or earlier (Riemann, 1868; P´oincare,
1905; and so on). In fact, a discrete formulation of the fundamental physical theory, which
should consider, in particular, as a variety of the discrete mathematics, didn’t realize during
those periods.

Now one may formulate the principal results of a given paper (parts I–III), which are got
in the framework of discrete graph formalism for Heisenberg—Dyson’s two-layer physics, in
comparison with the theses of an old and today’s continuous theory.

1. For the ﬁrst time in the late-1950s one had believed (see, in particular, Landau papers
Refs. [13, 2]) that solely a direct use of non-perturbative diagram technique is completely
consistent and could serve as a ground for an adequate successive construction of the future
fundamental theory without an adaptation to any former continuous theory (QED, QCD
and so on) or physical models. Factually it was an initial attempt to show the way for
an inevitable introduction of the discontinuity in the present physical theory in a form of
special diagram technique or, in terms of this paper, of graph kinematics of discrete physical
objects.

2. The most signiﬁcant and original conclusion following from the graph kinematics, in
the frame of the Heisenberg—Dyson’s two-layer approach (analysed in this part III), consists
in a many-“planes” RvT or SvT representation of any discrete physical object in opposition
to one-“plane” physical objects in continuous physical models. Essentially, that every prop-
erty and every type of interaction of a concrete discrete microobject can be connected with
the deﬁnite subsets of such “planes” from the full set of RvT — representation “planes”
for a given microobject. In any single case these separate “planes” or their sets must be
experimentally shown, directly or indirectly, for every discrete physical object as if crystal
faces, for example.

3. A many-“planes” representation of concrete discrete object in a form of the “hedge-
hog” — RvT or SvT sets may be originated by passing through a stage of the physical
dynamics in space — time and by postulating beyond space — time either a “physical
graph” as a some extremally derivative algebraic analog of the solution of diﬀerential equa-
tions for continuous microobject models or simply a “Kirchhoﬀ’s laws graph” as a ground
for the construction of a solution of already algebraic equations for macro network. Using
the Heisenberg—Dyson’s two-layer scheme one can now practically go over to the two-layer
matrix approximation on the base (1) which composed from an incidence I and a loop CD(δ)
graph matrices.

4. Next very important and unexpected result concerns to the superposition of diﬀer-
ent types of interaction or simultaneous presence of the four (or more) sorts of interaction
“charges” all round for any microobject (see Table 3). In the framework of many-“planes”
“hedgehog” — RvT representation the short-ranged interactions (weak, strong) can be de-
scribed by an one-“plane” “hedgehog” — RvT with maximum values of Mc reﬂected a
“compact” inner structure of any microobject in respect to the given interactions. Quite the
contrary, for the long-ranged interactions (gravitational, electromagnetic) there are the sets
of many-“planes” “hedgehog” — RvT with Mc < Mc
max − 1 determined an enough “trans-
parent” inner structure of the same microobject which may be considered as an adequate
hierarchical scheme of levels or “orbitals” (see Tables 2–3). Now a central problem of the

34

theory shifts to the decoding and interpretation of a many-“charge” discrete microobject in
the frame of two-layer Heisenberg—Dyson’s “hedgehog” — RvT formalism.

5. Based on the incidence matrix I “graph geometry” for the real discrete physical objects
describes all main characteristics reﬂected their peculiar many-“planes” inner structure in
the frame of purely discrete mathematics formalism beyond common space — time. There
is an essential problem to perform the crucial experiment for a suitable determination of
these characteristics.

6. The notion of such kind as an interacting “charge” of microobject in the graph
kinematics concept may be extracted only by means of the loop matrix CD(α) from the
symbolical quantities for the loop-forming quasi-continuous ﬁeld “objects” in Heisenberg—
Dyson’s two-layer matrix approximation.

7. Strong correlation between upper (discrete material objects) and under (quasi-
continuous ﬁeld “objects”) layers was set up with the help of Maxwell’s equations (13) and as
a reassured result the “mixed” non-linear picture of nature with the components of “charge”
and the components of “curl ﬁelds” ~E, ~D, ~H, ~B may be eliminated simply
4-vector
by the way of an introduction of the discrete physical objects conception in the framework of
two-layer matrix approximation for the linear Heisenberg—Dyson’s scheme. This example
illustrates also a general conclusion about the “universal linearity” beyond space—time.

In contrast to quantum mechanics, the set up earlier problems of a stability (or
reproduction) of deﬁnite stationary states, of a transition itself (or “jump”) of electron
between stationary states and of a sudden emission (or “production”) of discrete photon
in atoms may be considered naturally and straightforwardly on the base of Heisenberg—
Dyson’s two-layer graph kinematics for discrete atomic shell systems beyond space — time.
The simultaneous or “parallel” participation of all “planes” (or stationary forms) of any
stable shell system in “hedgehog” — RvT’s description means its permanent reproduction
by non-open “transferability” between “graph isomers” with the same number of vertices.
9. It is quite possible, that there are diﬀerent combinatorial failures in a complicated
RvT — representation of the many-“planes” discrete models for composite shell microsys-
tems as opposed to one-“plane” continuous models. It this way one may emerge, in partic-
ular, a “fatigue” of an atomic shell system with steady state sets (in spite of strictly line
spectra of excited atoms), which can be interpreted as a result of any default of a peripheral
part of the “graph isomers” (some breaking reproduction of initial atom) or as a result of
various transformations of this peripheral part into the balanced signed semiwalk of excited
atom.

10. In the frame of Heisenberg—Dyson’s two-layer physics one may introduce the “true
discontinuity” straightly for an initially structural discrete physical microobject on a “graph
language” beyond space—time, instead of “QN — discontinuity” (the discrete sets of various
free — introduced quantum numbers for the non-structural quasi-continuous “conditional
In this way one can present
microobject” and its dynamical quantities in space—time).
the precise nucleon mass, as an initial point of the “top hierarchy” consideration, by an
acceptance of the axiom of universal linearity of physical laws. At that the principle of
superposition must be realized in the form of a sum of Riemann’s “counting homogeneous
elements” including a particular variant of the set of “hedgehogs” — RvTs for constituent
parts of nucleon as a whole.

11. For the certain setting up of an adequacy of “hedgehog” — RvT approach to

35

the clearing of microworld picture one must carry out at least a rough classiﬁcation for a
total list of the experimental values of subnuclear microobject masses using the fractional
“fragments” 2−r3−s of the root trees numbers Tv. At average error of such Tv-estimation,
ranged 0 to 10 per cent, there take place the “concentration” of all masses within an interval
of RvT-vertices v = 9 ÷ 14 (see part II) and the “tracing” of the several basic (r, s) —
subsequences for lepton, quark and other real and hypothetical particle masses (see Tables
4–7).

12. With the use of natural “hedgehog” — RvT regularities, as the ﬁrst iteration in a
making of diﬀerent (r, s)-subsequences for microobject masses, one can derive a new “top
hierarchy” of particles, instead of more sophisticated “numerology” in the frame of artiﬁcial
symmetry multiplets within an old “QN — discontinuity” concept. This more regular “top
hierarchy” possesses a feature of the distinct separation of the masses of “chief” particles,
including electron (Tv=2=1), pions (Tv=9=286), N — baryons and some mesons (Tv=11=1842)
in basic (0, 0)-subsequence (initial 1-st level), and also the masses of main leptons µ and τ
in (0, 2)-subsequence (3-rd level). Any other category of particles belongs to the next more
deep levels of such “top hierarchy” with the ﬁxed “chief” particles (e, π, N) and several
mesons and charmed baryons.

13. The “doubleness” 2−r (or “mass doubletness” Tv/2r) as well as the “tripleness”
3−s (or “mass tripletness” Tv/3s) for subnuclear microobject masses are simply a natural
consequence of the “hedgehog” — RvT formalism application to the speciﬁc representation
of these discrete microobjects as fundamental constituents of the matter. Along with a
rough approach to subnuclear microobject masses by means of Tv and its fractions Tv/2r3s,
reﬂected permanently “ 1
3 — parts” of the “whole”, one may develop this
“doubletness” — “tripletness” RvT concept further for a more exact determination of these
masses using some other discrete microobject characteristics including various “charges”,
“spins”, and so on, for speciﬁcation of such “top hierarchy”.

14. The exchange forces between protons, that held them together, involve usually sev-
eral generating pions. Now in the framework of Heisenberg—Dyson’s approach to graph
kinematics of the discrete microobjects these pions are simply included (without any gener-
ation) as the autonomic graph constituent parts of proton. In a given form of description one
must maintain: (1) the principle of a graph integrity for RvTs of proton (number of vertices
v=11) and separately for RvTs of pions (number of vertices v=9) and also for RvTs of any
other constituent parts (number of vertices v 6 11) of proton; (2) the principle of a graph
non-reducing for RvTs of proton as a whole to the sum for RvTs of autonomic constituent
parts; (3) the principle of a graph reproduction (an intermediate mechanism) for RvTs of
proton through RvTs of pions.

15. Leptons µ and τ may be considered as the possible original excited states of lepton

e with an increased number of vertices:

vµ = ve + ∆vµ = 2 + 9 = 11;

vτ = ve + ∆vτ = 2 + 12 = 14.

In particular, a muon should be looked as an excited electron for which vµ concides with
vp = vn = 11 and ∆vµ = vπ = 9.

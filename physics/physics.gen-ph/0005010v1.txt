The methods of statistical physics of open systems are used for describing the time dependence
of economic characteristics (income, proﬁt, cost, supply, currency etc.) and their correlations with
each other. Nonlinear equations ( analogies of known reaction-diﬀusion, kinetic, Langevin equa-
tion) describing appearance of bifurcations, self-sustained oscillational processes, self-organizations
in economic phenomena are oﬀered.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. FORMULATION OF THE EQUATIONS.

One of the systems consisting of a big number of ele-
ments, which exchange information, currency, goods etc.
with each other is a market economy. The number of
the elements ( for example, of ﬁrms characterized by in-
come, dividend and investments size, demand and supply
value, labor cost and so on) is so great that application of
statistical physics methods to describe market economy
becomes possible. But now (as it seems) there is no a gen-
eral algorithms for subsequent theories applying methods
of statistical physics of open systems to market economy
(although G.Bystrai [1]- [3],A.Johansen and D.Sernette
[4],D.Meodows [5], W.Weidlich [6], I.Lubashevsky [7]
used some ideas of fractal geometry and nonequilibrium
thermodynamics). In the present paper the methods of
constructing of equations to describe economy charac-
ters behaviour are stated (see [8]) in the frames of math-
ematical formalism developed in statistical physics and
describing both self-organization processes and catastro-
phes. To do this a number of economic concepts xi(t)
(i = 1, ...N ; t denotes time) is introduced and used,
diﬀerent for diﬀerent economic problems, with xi be-
ing able to depend on other economic characteristics as
well. The concepts mentioned are then treated as ”coor-
dinates” of an economic system. Another set of economic
variables Fα(x1...xN , t, ˙x1... ˙xN ) is deﬁned as functions of
xi(t),
(i, j = 1...N, α = 1...β) etc. The set
of ”variables” xi and their relations with Fα are rela-
tive, that is the ”coordinates” xi in a concrete problem
can turn to be functions Fα in another one. If we are
to regard Fα(xi(t), ˙xi(t), ∂xi
, t) for a given α (i.e., Fα
∂χj
is a currency rate of exchange) as a set of macroscopic
functions characterizing the economic system under con-
sideration, it is possible to write down well developed in
statistical physics of open systems equations of nonlinear
kinetic, reaction-diﬀusion, oscillational types. Treatment
of these equations and their solutions, if being applied
to a concrete economic problem, allows to describe not
only well known economic regularities, but also to deﬁne
the values of and relations between economic parameters,
leading to drastic violations of an equilibrium.

˙xi(t), ∂xi

1. Consider an economic media consisting of N ele-
ments xi (i = 1, ...N ). Let this elements deﬁne func-
tions Fα (not necessary independent ones).
If while
changing governing parameters the elements themselves
change (an active media), then, provided the diﬀu-
sion type relations presence, the time behaviour of
Fα(xi(t), ˙xi(t), ∂xi
, t set can be described by a reaction

In special cases Iα may equals zero
Iα = 0 for some or all of α (it corresponds neglecting
the inﬂuence of the factors promoting Fα varying with
time).

2. Above there were formulated equations (1)-(3) de-
scribing time dependence of economic parameters (con-
sidered as variables or functions) of an open non equilib-
rium statistical system and including the description of
crisis or self-sustain oscillation processes as well. Never-
theless, so far as variables xi themselves can depend on
the other variables xj (i 6= j) and on functions Fα(xi...)
(stress again that in economy, because of the dependence
of almost all the factors on each other, the choice of vari-
ables xi and functions Fα(xi...) is quite an arbitrary and
may change from one problem to another), one should
supplement the eqs.
(1)-(3) by a system of equations
describing the xi dependence on xj and Fα. These equa-
tions can be chosen basing on the same ideas at the time
equations, that is can be obtained by substitution of ∂

for ∂

Eq.

and the time dependence is entirely deﬁned by time de-
pendencies of xβ and ˙xβ . The case of (7b) characterize
the temporal behaviour of the system deviation from the
equilibrium state Fα0 (x0, t). The relaxation time can be
a function of Fα (a nonlinear case).

The case of ϕ = α0F + α1F 3 includes nonlinear equa-

tions of Landau-Ginzburg type.

III. STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION OF

ECONOMICS PHENOMENON BY KINETIC

EQUATIONS

Equations (3)-(4) govern the behaviour of functions Fa
which are set by a xi values. Introduce therefore a set of
values taken by every of the variables xi. Let them be
distributed in a random way. Then introduce a function
fα(xi, ..., t) of density of probability to ﬁnd at the time
of t values of the economic parameters to be equal to xi
(i = 1...N ) (here we use one and the same symbol xi
for an economic parameter and its value). For the mean
values we shall have

3. One can include in eqs. (5)-(6) terms correspond-
ing to ”diﬀusion” in the ”velocity” space. The sums of
such ”diﬀusion” terms should be added to the right-hand
part of these equations. The system of equation (1)-(6)
seems to be able to give a full enough description of an
economic system behaviour near bifurcation points and
phase transitions.

4. Let Ia has the following form (here we neglect by

diﬀusion and nonlinear with respect to F terms),

a) Iα = 0

b) Iα =

fα(x) − Fα0

τ

τ is the relaxation time.

Then equation (3) reads

= Iα

where Iα and dfα

These equations corresponds to the statistical description
of economic systems in terms of kinetic equations (well
known in the theory of open systems [9]) for the economic
parameters distribution function and allow to calculate
the mean values for economic functions Fa. Adduce now
one more method of statistical description of economic
parameters xi and Fa based on using of equation like
that of Brownian motion in thermostat. The role of the
”thermostat” is played in economy by external inﬂuences

2

(e.g. currency infusion and so on) supporting any of the
system parameters to be constant (currency rate of ex-
change in our case correspondingly). Then the equation
for Fa is of Langevin type and for the only function F
has the form

d2F
dt2 + γ(F )

dF
dt

+ β(F ) = Y (t)

(11)

where γ(t) and β(t) are nonlinear with respect to F co-
eﬃcients, Y (t) is a random process corresponding, e.g.,
to a random inﬂuence of prices, demand etc.
The processes described by (11) can also be described in
terms of the distribution function f (F, x, t) and equations
like (8)-(10).

IV. ECONOMICAL PHENOMENON IN THE

MULTIFRACTAL ECONOMICAL SPACES

Many facts show on the possibility of useful describing
of economical phenomenon [4]and phenomenon of social
life [10], [4] by using idea of fractal dimensions. Thus
we point out the way of generalize of equations of above
paragraphs for multifractal economical spaces. For in-
cluding multifractal characteristics in equations (1)-(11)
we must use generalized Riemann-Liouville derivatives
deﬁned in [11]

Dd

+,tf (t) = (cid:18) d

dt(cid:19)nZ t

a

Dd

−,tf (t) = (cid:18) d

dt(cid:19)nZ b

f (t′)dt′

Γ(n − d(t′))(t − t′)d(t′)−n+1 (12)

(−1)nf (t′)dt′

Γ(n − d(t′))(t′ − t)d(t′)−n+1 (13)

where Γ(x) is Euler’s gamma function, and a and b are
some constants from [0, ∞). In these deﬁnitions, as usu-
ally, n = {d} + 1 , where {d} is the integer part of d if
d ≥ 0 (i.e. n − 1 ≤ d < n) and n = 0 for d < 0.
If
d = const, the generalized fractional derivatives (GFD)
(12)-(13) coincide with the Riemann - Liouville fractional
derivatives (d ≥ 0) or fractional integrals (d < 0).
In
the equations (1)-(11)for taking into account multifrac-
tal characteristics of economics phenomenon it is neces-
sary change ordinary derivatives by generalized Riemann-
Liouville derivatives.

V. CONCLUSION

The equations given above are quite general and wit-
ness only a possibility of describing economic processes in
terms of the mathematical formalism used in statistical
physics of open systems in the economical (topological or
fractal) spaces . Taking into account that in market econ-
omy one can observe catastrophes (e.g.,ﬁnancial crises,
bankrupts, fast changes in the current exchange rate) in

3

macro and microeconomic and stable processes like self
regulations, and the processes of development (stagna-
tion, demolishing) are determined by statistical reasons,
using of the methods of statistical physics given in the
present paper may turn to be very fruitful. A general al-
gorithm for economic processes description on the basis
of statistical physics equations for open system (mainly,
equations of reaction-diﬀusion type) is proposed. It con-
tains wide opportunities to use nonlinear equations and
governing parameters for economic problems, so far not
developed in a systematic way. The methodics described
can be easily adjusted to study mathematical regulari-
ties in biology, medicine, geology etc . We ask apology
for absence in this article of grate amount of cites at eco-
nomical papers concerning the mathematical problems of
economics because we can not ﬁnd direct connection our
description with known description of economical prob-
lems. The authors thank Ph.D. V.L.Kobeleva, the mem-
ber of our research group, for useful and fruitful discus-
sion and grate help.

Charge of a particle generated by a captured pair of photons

Herbert Weiß∗
Am Bucklberg 19, D-83620 Feldkirchen-Westerham, Germany
(Dated: December 11, 2013)

The model of charge generation is based on the wave model of a particle, for which a brief
description is given. The particle is comprised of two photons, captured in the volume of the
particle, and reveals the complete relativistic behaviour. The electromagnetic waves of the two
photons are supposed to induce an electrostatic ﬁeld. The surface integral of this electrostatic ﬁeld
is identiﬁed with the charge of the particle. The magnitude of the electric ﬁeld is derived from the
energy density of the photons. The volume and the surface are related to the wavelength of the
photons, thus leading to a charge of the particle, which is independent of its mass.

INTRODUCTION

×

In classical mechanics, as well as in quantum me-
the positive or negative charge of a par-
chanics,
ticle
is postulated to be an integer multiple of
elementary charge e, with a numerical value of
10−19 Coulomb (As) in SI units. Charge
1.602 176 53
is a physical quantity with outstanding properties: In
nature, it can achieve only two values, +e and
e. The
charge of a particle is independent from its mass. Charge
remains constant under any coordinate transformation,
the law of charge conservation is independent of the met-
ric used, it is a premetric law [1]. – Nevertheless, there
is only very few knowledge about the nature of charge.

−

Naudts and Kuna [2] give a new formulation of the par-
ticle model from Doplicher, Fredenhagen, and Roberts,
yielding the expression b2 = λhc0/ (2π) for the charge b of
the proton. λ is arbitrarily chosen and is assumed to be
the ﬁne structure constant α. – Chernitskii [3] takes the
idea of dyons from Schwinger. Dyons are entities which
carry electric charge as well as magnetic charge. He cre-
ates bidyons in taking two dyons a distance 2a apart
with equally sized electric charges d of same polarity and
equally sized magnetic charges b of opposite polarity in
order to cancel the net magnetic ﬂux of a closed surface
covering the particle. Dyons are supposed to have either
electric charge and/or magnetic charge. – Azc`arraga et.
al.
[4] report from a relativistic particle model using a
pair of twistors in a Liouville one-form which leads to
an enhanced phase space of 18 dimensions. Quantization
provides a set of wave equations determining mass, spin
and electric charge of a relativistic particle. The sum of
internal scalar charge t0 and t3 equals the electric charge
ep of the particle. Subsequently, constraint R6 equates
ep with elementary charge e. – Fedoruk et. al. [5] extend
the Shirafuji model using a two-twistor description and
quantize the model in order to obtain wavefunctions de-

scribing relativitstic particles with mass, spin, and elec-
tric charge. They predict numerical values coming from
the solution of suitable chosen constraints. The symbol q
enters constraint 4.2d for the charge of the particle, and q
is identiﬁed with elementary charge e. – A merely specu-
lative attempt to give an explanation of charge, indepen-
dent from e, comes from Baten [6], who suggests to relate
e to possible squeeze phases +1
electric charge +e and
or
1 of a hypothetical electromagnetic protoﬁeld move-
ment towards the so-called reduction center of a particle.
– Another approach is that of Hadley [7], who states that
Stokes theorem has limited application in manifolds that
are not time orientable. He says: “when the theorems do
not apply, it is possible to have the appearance of charge
arising from the source free equations, because there can
be a net surface ﬂux with zero enclosed charge.” The
non-zero net ﬂux can give rise to either a virtual electric
charge as well as a magnetic charge. – One can imagine
the diﬃculties and the enormous eﬀort arising from the
theoretical framework necessary to provide a solid basis
for a theory violating Stokes’ or Gaussian theorem in or-
der to yield an expression for the electric charge of a par-
ticle. We mention this, because our approach positively
applies Gaussian theorem in the usual manner, and it is
quite suﬃcient to yield a mechanism for creating charge
without endeavoring a special particle carrying elemen-
tary charge e, as will be shown below.

The models of charge, given in [2, 3, 4, 5], have refer-
ence to elementary charge e, meaning that the models are
adjusted to comply with observations. The charge model
presented here suﬀers from the same problem, it requires
the constant CW . Future development of the model is
supposed to resolve constant CW .

The mechanism of charge generation is based on the
wave model of a particle given in [8]. In order to provide
a suﬃcient basis for the charge model, we give a brief
description of the wave model in section II. The actual
model of charge generation is presented in section III. –
All equations are given exclusively in SI units.

II. WAVE MODEL OF A PARTICLE

Since Max Planck postulated in 1900 the electromag-
netic radiation being emitted and absorbed by discret
quanta [9] and the correct interpretation of the photo
eﬀect in 1905 by Albert Einstein [10], the dual nature
of electromagnetic waves was evident. Photons possess
properties of waves according to Maxwell equations as
well as properties of particles with momentum p accord-
ing to Eq. (1),

with h the Planck’s constant and λ the wavelength of
the photon. De Broglie’s idea was to assume a similar
duality for particles [11]. He relatet the momentum p of
a particle with mass m and speed v, Eq. (2), to a matter
wave of wavelength λ, Eq. (3).

p =

h
λ

p = mv

λ =

Four years later, in 1927, Davisson and Germer [12]
experimentally conﬁrmed de Broglie’s postulate by a
diﬀraction experiment with an electron beam directed
on Ni-crystals. The year before Erwin Schr¨odinger used
the idea of matter waves and deﬁned a wave equation for
particles, the Schr¨odinger equation [13]. The solution of
this wave equation gave the ﬁrst reasonable explanation
for the discrete states of an electron in an atom and was
the start of quantum mechanics. The dual properties of
particles are commonly accepted. The wave properties
are derived from equality (1), which is originally valid
for light quanta. For this reason the conjecture is near at
hand that a particle consists of light quanta. This idea
was used in the wave model of a particle.

A. Deﬁnition of wave model

A particle P is assumed to consist of two light quanta

Qh and Qr traveling in opposite directions (Fig. 1).

{

P =

Qh, Qr}
For convenience we assume these directions being
aligned with the x-axis. The light quanta are captured
between two walls L and R. We do not specify the na-
ture of the walls, we treat them being able to reﬂect the
electromagnetic wave of the captured photons, regard-
less of the energy. Quantum Qh travels in the positive
x-direction, is reﬂected by the right-hand wall R, and
the reﬂected part contributes to quantum Qr. Quantum
Qr travels in the negative x-direction, is reﬂected by the
left-hand wall L, and the reﬂected part contributes to
quantum Qh. The two walls must be held at a certain

with h denoting Planck’s constant. Putting Eqs. (6)

In order to obtain constructive interference, the sum

ng of wavecounts nh and nr must be an integer,

ng = nh + nr,

(15)

with conditions (16) and (17).

The propagation length sg is the sum of distances sh
and sr a state of the electromagnetic wave propagates,
starting at the left-hand wall L, traveling to the right-
hand wall R, and traveling back to the left-hand wall L
after reﬂection at the right-hand wall R. Distances sh
and sr are measured in the frame at rest, even for the
moving particle.

sg = sh + sr

(21)

We deﬁne the intrinsic period T of the particle, mea-
sured in the system at rest, as the time elapsed required
for a state of the electromagnetic wave to travel the dis-
tance sg.

Then, the surface of a particle resting in the origin of

the coordinate sytem is given by Eq. (30),

with the gamma factor given by (42).

and the diameters dy and dz, perpendicular to direc-

tion x, are given by Eq. (31).

dy(0) = dz(0) = d⊥ = d0

Using Eqs. (15) and (20) the wave counts nh and nr

can be calculated from Eqs. (36) and (37).

C. Particle moving at velocity v

Now, the particle moves at velocity v in the positive
x-direction. That means, the two walls are moving at
speed v. The frequencies of quanta Qh and Qr must
be diﬀerent because of the Doppler eﬀect. Considering
the reﬂection of the wave at the right-hand wall R yields
relation (34) of frequency fh to frequency fr.

Here, we encounter the problem that the relation to
the particle at rest is lost. The identity of the particle at
rest is the frequency f0. In order to recover the relation,
we introduce condition (35): the geometrical mean of
frequencies fh and fr must be equal to the frequency f0.

fhfr = f0

(35)

With Eq. (35) the frequencies fh and fr of the moving

particle can be calculated from Eq. (34) and yields

The propagation length sg of the moving particle is

given by Eq. (46).

The intrinsic time period T of the moving particle is

given by Eq. (47).

Considering the propagation of the electromagnetic
wave in directions diﬀerent from x and taking into ac-
count constructive interference, the moving particle must
aquire the form of a rotational ellipsoid according to Eq.

D. Properties of the wave model

The wave model of a particle is derived from postulate
(4) and condition (35) and yields the complete relativistic
behaviour of matter:

Length contraction is demonstrated by Eqs.
(30) and (48)

Time dilation is demonstrated by Eqs. (33) and
(47)

(54)

Relativistic energy is demonstrated by Eqs.
(24) and (40)

order to avoid deﬁning a propagation speed higher than
speed of light.

•

•

Relativistic momentum is demonstrated by
Eqs. (25) and (41)

Moreover, the wave model is able to give an explana-
tion for the enhanced lifetime of moving particles. The
model predicts a particle to posses an internal clock,
which is comprised of the captured photons bouncing be-
tween the two walls. The time elapsed between two ticks
becomes longer the faster the particle moves.

There is no mechanism known which is able to expound
such an odd behaviour of this matter wave, especially the
phenomenon that with velocity v = 0 the phase speed
becomes inﬁnity. Now, this problem can be solved with
the wave model. At time t0 we take a point on the x-axis
where the phases ϕh and ϕr sum up to phase ϕs,

E. de Broglie wavelength λd and phase speed cϕ

ϕh + ϕr = ϕs,

(56)

Equation (12) relates the momentum of the particle to

the diﬀerence fd of frequencies fh and fr.

and look for the condition of constant phase sum ϕs.
The phases ϕh and ϕr of the wave functions for Qh and
Qr, respectively, are given by Eqs. (57) and (58).

Although the diﬀerence frequency fd has no real rep-
resentation, for instance, by a photon of energy hfd cap-
tured within the walls, we can assign the wavelength λd
according to Eq. (50).

When we replace the diﬀerence frequency fd with the

right-hand side of Eq. (39)

fd = fh −

fr

λd =

λd =

and enhance numerator and denominator with
Planck’s constant h, Eq. (51) aquires the form (52) after
some simple rearrangement.

Using Einstein’s energy mass equivalence formula,

Wg = mgc2

with mg the correct relativistic mass of the moving
particle. Equation (53) is identical with Eq. (3), meaning
that the wave model of a particle yields an explanation
for matter waves and for the de Broglie wavelength.

When the de Broglie wavelength is used to calculate
the total energy of the particle employing Planck’s for-
mula E = hf , the corresponding frequency fB must be
calculated from a propagation speed other than speed of
light. The correct frequency is obtained using a propaga-
tion speed of cϕ = c2

In order to determine the magnitude of vector Ew, we

the energy Wg of a particle.

with the energy density w of an electromagnetic wave
equal to the square of the electric ﬁeld Ew times electric

The dimensionless constant CE gives the ratio of the

Ew derived from the energy of the particle. ε0, h, and
c0 are fundamental constants and the squareroot of their
product has, indeed, the units of a charge, so we refer to
the expression √ε0hc0 as the “Planck charge” denoted
by the symbol eh, Eq. (82)

To adjust the wave model of charge to the elementary
charge, we have to equate q with e and resolve Eq. (84)
with respect to constant CW . Because charges smaller
than e never have been observed, we assume a wave count
ng of 1 for the electron, thus constant CW is simply the
ratio of e and eh.

Equations (76) and (75) plugged in into Eq. (74) yield

then Eq. (81) aquires the simple form (84).

With Eq. (40) for the energy Wg of the particle, we
obtain Eq. (79) for the magnitude Ew of the electric ﬁeld
of the photons.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We took the idea of captured photons from the wave
model and calculated the electric ﬁeld on the surface of
a particle. The net ﬂux of this electric ﬁeld is equal to
the charge of the particle, and our rather simple model
showed that the charge is independent from its energy,
i.e., independent from its mass, just like observed in na-
ture. But we will not suppress the diﬃculties with this
model.

Generally, the ﬁeld vector Ew of the electromagnetic
wave oscillates at the frequency of the captured photons,
and subsequently, the charge ﬁeld vector Eq should also
oscillate. Then the mean of the ﬁeld vector, sampled
over a suﬃcient long time, should be zero, thus making
the net ﬂux to vanish and no charged particle should be
observed. The captured photons must have a property
rather diﬀerent from free running electromagnetic waves.
It seems like the captured photons being in a steady state,
i.e., the time derivative of the electric ﬁeld appears to
be zero ∂EP /∂t = 0. Another problem is that electrons,
protons, and most of the other particles possess spin, but
our model says nothing about the spin of a particle. The
future development must solve these problems in order
to achieve a model, where presently known properties of
particles are adequately represented.

Regarding Eqs. (36) and (37) the wave model assumes
a preferred frame of reference, and apparently it violates
Lorentz invariance. Obviously, the transformation of co-
ordinates applicable here must be diﬀerent from Lorentz
transformation, hence the Maxwell equations become
changed and the objection must be taken serious that
the wave model probably doesn’t comply with some ob-
servable phenomena. Recently, it has been demonstrated
[14, 15, 16] that a kind of a Galilean transformation, the

medium transformation, can be successfully applied on
Maxwell equations and the results are compliant with
observable phenomena. This medium transformation pri-
marily applies on the wave model, leading to properties of
space-time equal to those of Lorentz ether. But there is
no discrepancy with relativity, because Lorentz transfor-
mation can also be applied on the wave model, it tolerates
both transformations.

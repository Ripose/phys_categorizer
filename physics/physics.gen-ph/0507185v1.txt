Momentum Dependent Fundamental
Action

Karl De Paepe

December 10, 2013

Abstract

The fundamental action is dependent on momentum. Some conse-
quences are presented for matter waves and scalar quantum ﬁeld the-
ory.

1 Introduction

This article is a revision of K. De Paepe [1]. We present an argument as to
why the fundamental action or Planck’s “constant” is dependent on momen-
tum. Consider an unbound particle with wave function ψ(x, t) with compact
support. We then have by

φ(p) =

d3x
(2π)3/2

Z

ψ(x, 0)e−i p·x

~

that φ(p) is an entire function. There is then a nonzero probability the
particle has |p| larger than any given value and hence for an unbound particle
an energy larger than that of the universe which is impossible. The de Broglie
relation is

Instead of Eq. 1 use the following equation

ϕ(k) =

d3x
(2π)3/2

Z

ψ(x, 0)e−ik·x.

p = ~k.

(3)

Eq. 3 is just the inverse Fourier transform of the wave function whereas Eq. 1
involves the inverse Fourier transform and the assumption of Eq. 2. The fact
that p → ∞ as k → ∞ as happens in Eq. 2 leads to the impossibility as
presented above. We must have instead that

p = ~(p)k,

|p| ≤ pmax

(4)

for all k for some ﬁnite maximum magnitude of momentum pmax. This
implies that ~(p) → 0 as k → ∞. We could be more general and have
instead the fundamental action dependent on k but in this revised article
we will restrict to a fundamental action dependent on momentum and a
momentum that is an increasing function of |k|. By Eq. 3 there is a nonzero
probability that the particle with wave function as previous has a |k| larger
than any given value. The magnitude of the momentum will however by
Eq. 4 always be less than or equal to pmax.

We require that Eq. 4 hold for “simple” particles. Deﬁne ~(p) to be zero
for |p| larger than pmax. Now ~(p) could instead depend on energy and Emax
would the maximum energy. A macroscopic object with energy larger than
Emax could have zero de Broglie wavelength and so behave as a classical
particle. This could hold for a measuring apparatus providing a possible
resolution of the quantum measurement paradox. A measurement results in
a quantum system interacting with a classical measuring apparatus resulting
in a classical system not a superposition of quantum states.

We choose units so that the fundamental action is equal to 2π and the

speed of light is equal to one. We choose for Minkowski metric

η11 = η22 = η33 = −η44 = 1,

ηµν = 0 if µ 6= ν.

(5)

In what follows we will require throughout Lorentz invariance. In the fol-
lowing sections we present some interesting consequences of a momentum
dependent fundamental action for matter waves and scalar quantum ﬁeld
theory.

2 Matter Waves

For the matter wave of a particle with fundamental action dependent on
momentum

p = ~(p)k,

E = ~(p)ω.

(6)

Now (k, ω) is a four-vector and for a free particle (p, E) is a four-vector so
Eqs. 6 imply that ~(p) must be Lorentz invariant and hence ~(p) depends
only on |p|.

Consider a particle in a nonzero constant potential V . The energy of the

particle is

We then have for a plane wave by Eqs. 6 and Eq. 7 that

E =

p2 + m2 + V.

p

ω2 − k2 = 2V

k2 + m2~−2(p) + (V 2 + m2)~−2(p).

q

Now phase k · x − ωt and hence ω2 − k2 are Lorentz invariant so the right
hand side of Eq. 8 must be Lorentz invariant. Without introducing a special
inertial frame the right hand side of Eq. 8 can not be made Lorentz invariant
even when ~(p) = 1.

The inertial frame F that is at rest with respect to the distant stars
is the only special inertial frame. This inertial frame is needed in order to
deﬁne acceleration and hence mass of any particle. In inertial frame F we
can deﬁne basis vectors

u1 = (1, 0, 0, 0), u2 = (0, 1, 0, 0), u3 = (0, 0, 1, 0), u4 = (0, 0, 0, 1)

(9)

and four-vector

Since

p = (p,

p2 + m2).

p

u4 · p =

(u1 · p)2 + (u2 · p)2 + (u3 · p)2 + m2

p

p

we have that any Lorentz invariant function constructed from vectors p, uµ
which in the frame F is a function of |p| must be equal to a function of

L(p) =

(u1 · p)2 + (u2 · p)2 + (u3 · p)2.

(12)

Deﬁne ~(p) to be the function of L(p) that in the inertial frame F is the
function ~(p).

where M is a very large mass we have using using Eq. 8 and Eq. 13 with
V = 0 for group velocity of the matter wave

The particle velocity v is using Eqs. 6 and Eq. 14

By Eq. 7 with V = 0 we have |v| < 1. As k → ∞

The magnitude of group velocity for large k will be slightly larger than the
speed of light. If a macroscopic object with mass much larger than M could
be made into a “simple” particle its magnitude of group velocity could be
much larger than the speed of light.

Scalar Quantum Field Theory

Let the self-adjoint operator φ(x) represent the scalar quantum ﬁeld. We can
deﬁne operators q(p, t) and p(p, t) by

q(p, t)eip·x,

p(p, t) = ˙q(−p, t)

(17)

φ(x) =

d3p
(2π)3/2

Z

where q(p, t) satisﬁes

[q(p, t), q(p′, t)] = 0

and

By Eq. 17 and Eq. 19,

[q(p, t), p(p′, t)] = i~(p)δ(3)(p − p′).

[φ(x′, t), ∂4φ(x, t)] = i

d3p
(2π)3

eip·(x′−x)~(p).

(20)

Since ~(p) has compact support the right hand side of Eq. 20 is an entire
function in x′ − x. There is then a point x such that

Eq. 21 implies there must be value of t such that x2 − t2 > 0 and

[φ(0), ∂4φ(x, 0)] 6= 0.

[φ(0), φ(x, t)] 6= 0.

This is however zero for the scalar quantum ﬁeld theory where ~(p) = 1.
Eq. 22 implies there are measurements that are separated by a space-like
interval that can inﬂuence each other.

Consider the following free scalar ﬁeld

φ(x) =

Z

d3p
(2π)3/2

~1/2(p)
(2p4)1/2 (eip·xa(p) + e−ip·xa†(p))

where

p

Comparing with Eq. 17 we have

p4 =

p2 + m2,

[a(p), a†(p′)] = δ(3)(p − p′),

[a(p), a(p′)] = 0.

(24)

q(p, t) =

~1/2(p)
(2p4)1/2 (e−ip4ta(p) + eip4ta†(−p)).

Now q(p, t) satisﬁes Eq. 18, Eq. 19 and

i~(p) ˙q(p, t) = [q(p, t),

d3x

˙φ2 + (∇φ)2 + m2φ2

].

and Lorentz invariant.

Maxwell’s equations comprise both electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds. The transverse part
of the vector potential belongs to magnetism, the longitudinal one is concerned with gravitation.
The Coulomb gauge indicates that longitudinal components of the ﬁelds propagate instantaneously.
The delta-function singularity of the ﬁeld of the divergence of the vector potential, referred to as
the dilatation center, represents an elementary agent of gravitation. Viewing a particle as a source
or a scattering center of the point dilatation, the Newton’s gravitation law can be reproduced.

Let us derive from (1.13), (1.14), (1.18), (1.19) and (1.20) the wave equations for the solenoidal (transverse) and

potential (longitudinal) components of the ﬁelds. In what follows we will use the general vector relation

The wave equation for Ar can be found thus. Diﬀerentiate (1.13) with respect to time:

Thus, Maxwell’s equations (1.1)-(1.3) with the speciﬁc Lorentz gauge (2.6) imply that the solenoidal and potential
components of the ﬁelds propagate with diﬀerent velocities. Solenoidal components propagate with the speed c of
light. Their wave equations are (2.3) and (2.5). Potential components and the electrostatic potential propagate with
a speed cg. Their wave equations are (2.9), (2.11) and (2.14).

3. QUASIELASTICITY

Equations (2.3) and (2.9) have the character of the elastic equations. In this connection, the vector potential A
can be correspondent1 with a certain displacement ﬁeld s, and the density j of the current – with the density f of an
external force . The gauge relation (2.6) is interpreted as a linearized continuity equation, in which the constant cg
has directly the meaning of the speed of an expansion-contraction wave2. We are interested in the interaction of two

external forces f1 and f2, which produce elastic ﬁelds s1 and s2, respectively. The energy of the elastic interaction is
given by the general relation

U12 = − ς

f1 · s2d3x = − ς

f2 · s1d3x ,

Z

where the sign minus in (3.1) corresponds to conditions of the Clapeyron theorem3, ς is a constant.

Suppose that

Then, through (1.7) relations (2.6) and (1.8) turn to the Coulomb gauge

We have according to (1.16) and (1.17)

jr = ∇ × R,

jg = ∇G ,

where R and G are vector and scalar ﬁelds. Using (1.15), (3.8), (3.7), (1.7) and (1.9) take the following integral by
parts:

From (3.9) and (3.5) we get the regular expression for the energy of magnetostatic interaction

where qv and aµ are constant vectors, |µ| = 1. They describe a moving electric charge and a point magnetic dipole,
respectively1. Substituting (3.11) and (3.12) into the right-hand part of the equation (2.3) we can ﬁnd the ﬁelds A
produced by these forces. Then, substituting these ﬁelds into (3.10) and (3.5), we arrive at the well-known expressions
for the interaction energies of electric currents and point magnetic dipoles.

The elementary source of the longitudinal part Ag of the vector potential is given by the density of the external

force of the form

fg = − 4πcgb∇δ (x − x′

Following (3.1)-(3.4) we have for the energy of longitudinal interaction:

Expression (3.19) implies, that two dilatation centers (3.15) interact with each other only if they are in a direct
contact. The sign of (3.18), or (3.19), indicates that this is the attraction.

Take notice that solenoidal and potential ﬁelds are orthogonal to each other in the sense of (3.1). Indeed, using

(3.8), (1.8) and (1.9), we ﬁnd that

We consider dilatation centers distributed with the volume density bp (x). Then equation (3.15) becomes

The interaction energy of the two clusters, or clouds, of dilatation centers can be found substituting delta-functions
in (3.18) by the reduced densities p (x) of the distributions. This gives

Consider a weak source at x∗, which emits dilatation centers with a suﬃciently high linear velocity υg. Such a source

We will assume that each particle is a weak source of the point dilatation (3.15) or a scattering center in a dynamic
sea of the point dilatation, the strength b of the source being proportional to the particle’s mass. Then relation (4.4)
will be a model of the Newton’s law of gravitation.

Notice that in the model thus constructed we must distinguish the speed υg, with which the gravitational interaction

is transmitted, and the speed cg of the longitudinal wave. The latter can be interpreted as the gravitational wave.

Thus, gravitation enters into the general structure of Maxwell’s equations. A gravitating center is formally modeled

by a potential component of the current having the form

And the gravitational interaction is calculated by means of the general relation (3.16), where the longitudinal com-
ponent Ag of the vector potential is found substituting (4.5) into the longitudinal part (2.9) of Maxwell’s equations.

5. CONCLUSION

Maxwell’s equations (1.1)-(1.3) describe both electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds. The transverse part of the
vector potential belongs to magnetism, and longitudinal one is concerned with gravitation. Transverse ﬁelds propagate
with the speed of light. The Coulomb gauge (3.7) indicates that longitudinal waves propagate in eﬀect instantaneously,
comparing with transverse waves. Choosing properly expressions for the current density, magnetic and gravitational
interactions can be modeled. An elementary agent of the gravitational interaction corresponds to the dilaton, which
is a delta-function singularity (3.15) of the ﬁeld of the divergence of the vector potential . The sources of longitudinal
and transverse ﬁelds do not interact with each other. This signiﬁes that gravitation can not be detected with the aid
of light.

In the end it should be noted that some of the questions considered here and in1 were recently approached in5.

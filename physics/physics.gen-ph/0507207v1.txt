Abstract

A generating function is derived that counts the number of diagrams in an arbi-
trary scalar ﬁeld theory. The number of graphs containing any number nj of j-point
vertices is given. The count is also used to obtain the number of classical graphs in
gauge theory and gravity.

A count of scalar ﬁeld theory graphs in a an arbitrary scalar Lagrangian is exactly
given. The count also produces the relevant number of tree graphs in gauge theory
and general relativity. Some well known work in this direction is contained in the
articles [1].

The count is produced by coupling a scalar ﬁeld theory to an auxiliary ﬁeld that
couples vertices together through the internal lines of the tree diagrams. The number
of m-point vertices is deduced by keeping track of the coupling constant of the scalar
and auxiliary ﬁeld interaction.

The initial Lagrangian is,

L =

ξ2 +

λjξaφj−a

M

,

with the interactions φnξm. The λj couplings enter the graphs, with external φ lines
and internal ξ lines. Integrating out the auxiliary ξ ﬁeld produces all of these classical
contributions.

The ﬁnal Lagrangian is a function L(φ, λj); expanding it in terms of the scalar

ﬁeld and the couplings λj generates

Lf = X an,{nj}φn

,

and the number nj tells how many j-point vertices there are in the diagram with n
external lines. An n-point graph with
nj vertices has the multiplicity of an,{nj}n!;
this number is derived by integrating out the ξ ﬁeld and expanding the expression in
φ and the vertex couplings.

P

The equations of motion of ξ after a shift of ξ → ξ − φ/2 is,

0 = ξ − φ/2 +

(j − 1)! (cid:16)(ξ + φ/2)j−1 − (ξ − φ/2)j−1

(cid:17) .

In the limit of large vertex number M, i.e. M → ∞, and when the couplings are
identiﬁed λj = λ, the form in (3) is,

(2)

0 = ξ − φ/2 + λ(cid:16)−ξ − φ/2 + ξ − φ/2(cid:17) + λ(cid:16)eξ+φ/2 − eξ−φ/2

or,

0 = ξ + (−1/2 − λ)φ + 2λeξ sinh(φ/2) .

Shifting back ξ → ξ + φ/2 generates,

0 = ξ − λφ + 2λeξeφ/2 sinh(φ/2) .

This is transcendental equation in ξ which has a formal power seriers solution.

The solution to (6) is obtained with the use of the Lambert solution. As only
the perturbative solution in ξ is required the branch cuts are ignored. Label the
parameters as,

a = 1 b = 2λeφ/2 sinh(φ/2)

c = 1 d = −λφ .

The general solution to this equation is,

which in the case of interest in (6) is,

ξ = −WL(bed) + d .

The Lambert function W L(x) has the power series expansion of

The solution to ξ is used to resubstitute into the initial Lagrangian to obtain the
power series expansion in φ and λ.

The expansion in φ and λ is

L = X an,mφnλm ,

and counts the diagrams with multiple vertices at n − 2-point. The count of diagrams
can be obtained with any arbitrary vertex conﬁguration, i.e. any numbers nj, with
the λ coupling only; that is, this is simpler than retaining all of the λj couplings. An
n-point diagram with only 3-point vertices has n3 = n − 2 and the n-point diagram
with only a 3-point and n − 2 vertex has n3 = nn−2 = 1. These are the vertex bounds
without external ξ ﬁelds. Deﬁne m =
nj as the sum of all of the nj vertices; then
an,m counts the diagrams for m at n point. A normalization factor of n! is required
to compensate for the symmetry factor in the ﬁnal scalar Lagrangian.

As an example, integrating out the auxiliary ﬁeld that contributes to four-point

diagrams gives,

The symmetry factor of 3 comes from the three diagrams that contribute, those in
the s, u, and t channels. Thus, 4! times 2−3 equals 3, and this is how many diagrams

there are at four-point which stem from the three-point vertices. The more general
case is examined with the use of solving the transcendental equation and re-inserting
the solution into the Lagrangian in (1).

The series expansion complicated by the multiple sums involved. A Taylor series

expansion is used to extract the appropriate n and m.

The contribution from L1 is similar and can be determined from the same operations.
α1 and α2 are deﬁned as before. The sums also could be simpliﬁed more, and the
large n expansion generates the known exponential dependence.

These combinatorical factors can also be used to ﬁnd the multiplicity of gauge and
gravity diagrams. In Gervais-Neveu guage, the 3-point and 4-point vertices of a non-
abelian gauge theory contain 6 and 12 terms in a diagram without color ordering. The
individual scalar ﬁeld contributions with n3 and n4 vertices (3 and 4-point) expand
into an additional 3n34n4 combinations; the propagator contains only a single ηµν and
does not cause further multiplicity.

Closed form expressions for graph multiplicities in quantum ﬁeld theory are given.
The count pertains to scalar ﬁeld theory with any number and type of vertices. The
number of diagrams an,m counts the classical ﬁeld diagrams at n-point containing
vi = m vertices, with i being the number of lines at each vertex. The count is
P
useful for determining the naive complexity of tree graph calculations in quantum ﬁeld
theory. Also, the count is useful in determining K¨ahler potentials in toric varieties,
which requires the number of tree graphs at zero momentum in order to determine
the D-terms.

Abstract

Galilean Relativity and Einstein’s Special and General Relativity showed
that the Laws of Physics go deeper than their representations in any
given reference frame. Thus covariance, or independence of Laws of
Physics with respect to changes of reference frames became a funda-
mental principle. So far, all of that has only been expressed within
one single mathematical model, namely, the traditional one built upon
the usual continuum of the ﬁeld R of real numbers, since complex
numbers, ﬁnite dimensional Euclidean spaces, or inﬁnite dimensional
Hilbert spaces, etc., are built upon the real numbers. Here, following
[55], we give one example of how one can go beyond that situation and
study what stays the same and what changes in the Laws of Physics,
when one models them within an inﬁnitely large variety of algebras of
scalars constructed rather naturally. Speciﬁcally, it is shown that the
Special Relativistic addition of velocities can naturally be considered
in any of inﬁnitely many reduced power algebras, each of them con-
taining the usual ﬁeld of real numbers and which, unlike the latter,

1

are non-Archimedean. The nonstandard reals are but one case of such
reduced power algebras, and are as well non-Archimedean. Two sur-
prising and strange eﬀects of such a study of the Special Relativistic
addition of velocities are that one can easily go beyond the velocity of
light, and rather dually, one can as easily end up frozen in immobility,
with zero velocity. Both of these situations, together with many other
ones, are as naturally available, as the usual one within real numbers.

1. Introduction

There has for longer been an awareness that the exclusive use of
the continuum given by the ﬁeld R of real numbers in building up
the conventional modelling of Physical space-time is in fact not im-
plied by any particular Physical reason, but rather by Mathematical
convenience. Details in this regard can be found in [2,3,5,10,11,21-
26,31,48,49, 52,54,55] and the literature cited there.
One of the simplest and hardest arguments in this regard has been
the observation that only rational numbers - thus in Q and not in the
whole of R - can ever turn up as results of Physical measurements.
And needless to say, the diﬀerence between Q and R is considerable,
not least since the former is merely countable, while the latter is not,
being in fact uncountable and of the power of the continuum.

Needless to say, if we want to replace R, and thus the usual structures
built upon it and used in Physics, with other scalars and correspond-
ing structures, we still need to keep basic algebraic operations such
as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. However, such
operations do not necessarily imply the use of ﬁelds, since they can
be performed as well in the more general algebraic structures called
algebras. And as well known, and shown in the sequel, there are many
more algebras to use, than ﬁelds. And in fact, there are inﬁnitely
many such algebras which can be constructed in rather easy ways,
thus making their use convenient, see [54,55].

In this way

The issue of progressing one step ahead in furthering the
Principle of Relativity, this time not by mere covariance

2

with respect to reference frames, but by studying the pos-
sible covariance with respect to algebras of scalars in which
the Laws of Physics are formulated, may appear as rather
natural.

A remarkable latest contribution in this regard can be found in [32].
One of the basic deﬁciencies of the ﬁrst von Neumann Hilbert space
model of Quantum Mechanics has been the fact that observables of
central importance, such a position, momentum or energy, may lack
eigenstates within the respective Hilbert spaces, [51]. So far, the only
rigorous mathematical approach to this deﬁciency has been the rigged-
Hilbert space formalism. However, in this approach the respective
eigenstates may still fall outside of the Hilbert spaces under consider-
ation. It is in this regard that [32], by the use of the nonstandard real
numbers, brings a convenient clariﬁcation.

However, it is important to note the following. The alternative is not
at all restricted to either using the usual ﬁeld R of real numbers, or
instead, the nonstandard ﬁeld ∗R.
Indeed, as it happens, there is naturally a far larger choice at dis-
posal. Namely, one can study the use of any of inﬁnitely many al-
gebras, among which both the usual reals and the nonstandard ones
are but particular cases. And this inﬁnitely large class of algebras can
be constructed by the reduced power method presented brieﬂy in the
sequel, see also [54, 55].

By the way of the latest contribution in [32], a less well known fact
seems to be that, as early as 1935, von Neumann himself got disap-
pointed in the use of Hilbert spaces in Quantum Mechanics, as men-
tioned in one of his letters, [51].

Recent suggestions for going beyond the exclusive use of R in building
models of Physical space-time have been presented in [2,3,5,10,11,21,23,
26,48,49,52,54,55], as well as in the literature mentioned there.

Among others, one can envision the replacement of R by other ﬁelds of
numbers, such as for instance, the p-adic ﬁelds Qp, for various prime
numbers p ∈ N, or even the ﬁeld ∗R of nonstandard reals.

3

On the other hand, as noted in [54,55], the need to use ﬁelds is not
implied by any speciﬁc Physical reason either. Therefore, one could
also employ the more general structures of algebras, and in this case,
as recalled in [55], there is a practically unlimited, and in fact inﬁnite
variety of such algebras which can be constructed easily as reduced
powers of R.

It is important to note that with the conventional use of R, one of the
speciﬁc features of R one has to accept is that, as an ordered ﬁeld, R is
Archimedean. In this regard, two facts can be noted. First, the need to
have the Archimedean property is again not implied by any particular
Physical reason. And in fact, this property often leads to diﬃculties
related to so called ”inﬁnities in Physics”, diﬃculties attempted to
be treated by various ad-hoc ”re-normalization” procedures. On the
other hand, such diﬃculties can easily be avoided from the start, if
the use of R is set aside, since they simply do no longer appear in
case one employs instead non-Archimedean structures, as illustrated
in the better known case of nonstandard reals ∗R. Second, the alter-
natives suggested to R, such as the p-adic ﬁelds Qp or the inﬁnitely
large class of algebras constructed as reduced powers, turn out not to
be Archimedean.

Consequently, lacking any known Physical reason why we should be
conﬁned to the use of Archimedean structures alone, we can equally
investigate the way various Laws of Physics may take shape when non-
Archimedean structures are employed.

In this regard, in the sequel, we shall study what happens to the law
of addition of velocities in Special Relativity, when instead of the con-
ventional Archimedean ﬁeld R of real numbers one employs any in the
inﬁnite class of algebras of reduced powers which, as mentioned, are
non-Archimedean.

One of the unexpected and strange eﬀects of considering the Special
Relativistic addition of velocities in non-Archimedean setup is that
one can easily go beyond the velocity of light, and somewhat dually,
one can as easily end up frozen in immobility, with zero velocity, both
of these situations, together with many other ones, being as naturally

4

available, as the usual one.

2. Isomorphisms of velocity addition

As shown in [53], and speciﬁed brieﬂy in section 4 below, velocity ad-
dition in Special Relativity and Newtonian Mechanics are isomorphic
as group operations.

Namely, let c > 0 be the velocity of light in vacuum. Then, as is well
known, in the case of uniform motion along a straight line, the Special
Relativistic addition ∗ of velocities is given by

(SR)

u ∗ v = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c2), u, v ∈ (−c, c)

thus the binary operation ∗ acts according to

∗ : (−c, c) × (−c, c) −→ (−c, c)

It follows immediately that

(IS1)

∗ is associative and commutative

(IS2)

u ∗ v ∗ w = (u + v + w + uvw/c2)/(1 + (uv + uw + vw)/c2)
for u, v, w ∈ (−c, c)

(IS3)

u ∗ 0 = 0 ∗ u = u, u ∈ (−c, c)

(IS4)

u ∗ (−u) = (−u) ∗ u = 0, u ∈ (−c, c)

(IS5)

∂/∂u(u ∗ v) = (1 − v2/c2)/(1 + uv/c2)2 > 0, u, v ∈ (−c, c)

(IS6)

limu, v→c u ∗ v = c,

limu, v→−c u ∗ v = − c

Therefore

(IS7)

( (−c, c), ∗ ) is a commutative group with the neutral
element 0, while −u is the inverse element of u ∈ (−c, c)

5

3. Velocity addition in Newtonian Mechanics

As is well known, in the case of uniform motion along a straight line,
the addition of velocities in Newtonian Mechanics is given by

(NM)

x + y, x, y ∈ R

thus it is described by the usual additive group (R, +) of the real
numbers, a group which is of course commutative, with the neutral
element 0, while −x is the inverse element of x ∈ R.

4. Isomorphisms of the two groups of velocity addition

As shown in [53], the following hold.

(IS8)

( (−c, c), ∗ ) and (R, +) are isomorphic groups through the
mappings

(IS8.1)

α : (−c, c) −→ R, where

α(u) = k ln((c + u)/(c − u)), u ∈ (−c, c)

and

with

(IS8.2)

β : R −→ (−c, c), where

β(x) = c(ex/k − 1)/(ex/k + 1), x ∈ R

(IS8.3)

k = c2α′(0) > 0

(IS9)

both α and β are strictly increasing mappings

6

5. Note

The Special Relativistic addition ∗ of velocities in (SR) is in fact well
deﬁned not only for pairs of velocities

(u, v) ∈ (−c, c) × (−c, c)

but also for the larger set of pairs of velocities

(u, v) ∈ [−c, c] × [−c, c], uv 6= −c2

This corresponds to the fact that in Special Relativity the velocity c
of light in vacuum is supposed to be attainable, namely, by light itself
in vacuum.

On the other hand, the Newtonian addition + of velocities (NM) does
of course only make sense Physically for

(x, y) ∈ R × R

since inﬁnite velocities are not supposed to be attainable Physically.

As for the group isomorphisms α and β, they only generate mappings
between pairs of velocities in

(−c, c) × (−c, c) α×α−→ R × R

and

R × R

β×β
−→ (−c, c) × (−c, c)

thus they do not cover the cases of addition u ∗ v of special relativistic
velocities u = −c and v < c, or −c < u, and v = c.

Consequently, in spite of the group isomorphisms α and β, there is an
essential diﬀerence between the addition of velocities in Special Rela-
tivity, and on the other hand, Newtonian Mechanics. Indeed, in the
latter case, the addition + is deﬁned on the open set R × R, while in

7

the former case the addition ∗ is deﬁned on the set

{ (u, v) | − c ≤ u, v ≤ c, uv 6= −c2 }

which is neither open, nor closed.

6. Reduced Power Algebras

We shall now show how the group isomorphisms (IS8.2), (IS8.3) can
naturally be extended to reduced power algebras.

First, for convenience, let us recall brieﬂy the general method for con-
structing an inﬁnitely large class of algebras obtained as reduced pow-
ers, [55]. This reduced power construction, in its more general forms,
is one of the fundamental tools in Model Theory, [20,58]. Historically,
even if only in a particular case and in an informal manner, it can
be traced back to its use in the 19th century in the classical Cauchy-
Bolzano construction of the ﬁeld R of real numbers from the set Q of
rational ones. Various other familiar instances of the reduced power
construction in modern Mathematics can often be encountered, for
instance, when completing metric spaces, or in general, uniform topo-
logical spaces.

Let Λ be any inﬁnite set, then the power RΛ is in a natural way an asso-
ciative and commutative algebra. Namely, the elements ξ ∈ RΛ can be
seen as mappings ξ : Λ −→ R, and as such, they can be added to, and
multiplied with one another point-wise. Namely, if ξ, ξ ′ : Λ −→ R,
then

In the same way, the elements ξ ∈ RΛ can be multiplied with scalars
from R, namely

(ξ + ξ ′)(λ) = ξ(λ) + ξ ′(λ),

λ ∈ Λ

(ξ . ξ )(λ) = ξ(λ) . ξ ′(λ),

λ ∈ Λ

(a . ξ)(λ) = a . ξ(λ),

a ∈ R, λ ∈ Λ

8

The well known remarkable fact connected with such a power algebra
RΛ is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the proper
ideals in it, and on the other hand, the ﬁlters on the inﬁnite set Λ,
see for instance [54,55] and the literature cited there.
Indeed, this
one-to-one correspondence operates as follows

I 7−→ FI = { Z(ξ) | ξ ∈ I }

(6.1)

F 7−→ IF = { ξ ∈ Λ −→ R | Z(ξ) ∈ F }

where I is an ideal in RΛ, F is a ﬁlter on Λ, while for ξ ∈ Λ −→ R,
we denoted Z(ξ) = {λ ∈ Λ | ξ(λ) = 0}, that is, the zero set of ξ. As
is known, the critical part in (6.1) is that FI constitutes a ﬁlter on Λ,
see the proof of (3.7) in [54] for details.

The great practical advantage of the one-to-one correspondence be-
tween the proper ideals in RΛ, and on the other hand, the ﬁlters on
the inﬁnite set Λ is that the latter are much simpler mathematical
structures. Furthermore, the speciﬁc way reduced powers are con-
structed, see (6.4), (6.5) below, brings in the power of clarity and
simplicity which made Model Theory such an important branch of
modern Mathematics.

However, it is important to note that, fortunately, no knowledge of
Model Theory is needed in order to be able to make full use of the re-
duced power algebras. Indeed, a usual ﬁrst course in Algebra, covering
such issues as groups, quotient groups, rings and ideals is suﬃcient.
In this regard, Model Theory comes in only in order to motivate and
highlight the naturalness of the construction which leads to reduced
power algebras.

Here one further fact should be noted. As is well known, the nonstan-
dard reals ∗R can also be constructed as reduced powers. However,
their respective construction is in a way an extreme case, since it uses
the special class of free ultraﬁlters. An essential resulting aspect is
the so called transfer property, with the accompanying discrimination
between internal and external entities, which introduces a whole host
of technical complications to deal with, in order to be able to beneﬁt

9

fully from the power of Nonstandard Analysis.
In this regard, the use of free ultraﬁlters is needed in the construc-
tion of nonstandard reals ∗R only in order to obtain them as a totally
ordered ﬁeld. Otherwise, if we are ready to use algebras which are
not ﬁelds, nor totally ordered, we can employ the much larger class
of ﬁlters, instead of ultraﬁlters. Anyhow, even in the case of the non-
standard reals we end up with the non-Archimedean property.

Consequently, the general form of the reduced power construction used
here, as well as in [54, 55], does not restrict itself to ultraﬁlters, and
thus avoids the mentioned technical diﬃculties related to nonstandard
transfer, yet it can beneﬁt from much of the power, clarity and sim-
plicity familiar in Model Theory.

Important properties of the one-to-one correspondence in (6.1) are as
follows. Given two ideals I, J in RΛ, and two ﬁlters F , G on Λ, we have

I ⊆ J =⇒ FI ⊆ FJ

F ⊆ G =⇒ IF ⊆ IG

Furthermore, the correspondences in (6.1) are idempotent when iter-
ated, namely

(6.2)

(6.3)

I 7−→ FI

7−→ IFI = I

F 7−→ IF

7−→ FIF = F

It follows that every reduced power algebra

(6.4) A = RΛ/I

where I is a proper ideal in RΛ, is of the form

(6.5) A = AF

def
= RΛ/IF

for a suitable unique ﬁlter F on Λ.

We shall call Λ the index set of the reduced power algebra AF = RΛ/IF ,
while F will be called the generating ﬁlter which, we recall, is a ﬁlter

10

on that index set.

Obviously, we can try to relate various reduced power algebra AF = RΛ/IF
to one another, according to the two corresponding parameters which
deﬁne them, namely, their inﬁnite index sets Λ and their generating
ﬁlters F .

We start here by relating them with respect to the latter. Namely, a
direct consequence of the second implication in (6.2) is the following
one. Given two ﬁlters F ⊆ G on Λ, we have the surjective algebra
homomorphism

(6.6) AF ∋ ξ + IF

7−→ ξ + IG ∈ AG

This obviously means that the algebra AG is smaller than the algebra
AF , the precise meaning of it being that

(6.6∗) AG and AF /(IG/IF ) are isomorphic algebras

which follows from the so called third isomorphism theorem for rings,
a classical result of Algebra.

Here we note that in the particular case when the ﬁlter F on Λ is
generated by a nonvoid subset I ⊆ Λ, that is, when we have

(6.7) F = { J ⊆ Λ | J ⊇ I }

then it follows easily that

(6.8) AF = RI

which means that we do not in fact have a reduced power algebra, but
only a power algebra.

For instance, in case I is ﬁnite and has n ≥ 1 elements, then AF = Rn
is in fact the usual n-dimensional Euclidean space.

Consequently, in order to avoid such a degenerate case of reduced

11

power algebras, we have to avoid the ﬁlters of the form (6.7). This
can be done easily, since such ﬁlters are obviously characterized by the
property

(6.9) T J ∈ F J = I 6= φ

It follows that we shall only be interested in ﬁlters F on Λ which sat-
isfy the condition

(6.10) T J ∈ F J = φ

or equivalently

∀ λ ∈ Λ :

(6.11)

∃ Jλ ∈ F :

λ /∈ Jλ

which is further equivalent with

∀ I ⊂ Λ, I ﬁnite :

(6.12)

Λ \ I ∈ F

(6.14) F re(Λ) ⊆ F

This in particular means that

(6.14∗)

∀ I ∈ F :

I is inﬁnite

12

We recall now that the Frech´et ﬁlter on Λ is given by

(6.13) F re(Λ) = { Λ \ I | I ⊂ Λ, I ﬁnite }

In this way, condition (6.10) - which we shall ask from now on about
all ﬁlters F on Λ - can be written equivalently as

Indeed, if we have a ﬁnite I ∈ F , then Λ \ I ∈ F re(Λ), hence (6.14)
gives Λ \ I ∈ F . But I ∩ (Λ \ I) = φ, and one of the axioms of ﬁlters
is contradicted.

In view of (6.6), it follows that all reduced power algebras considered
from now on will be homomorphic images of the reduced power alge-
bra AF re(Λ), through the surjective algebra homomorphisms

(6.15) AF re(Λ) ∋ ξ + IF re(Λ)

7−→ ξ + IF ∈ AF

or in view of (6.6∗), we have the isomorphic algebras

(6.15∗) AF , AF re(Λ)/(IF /IF re(Λ))

∗R are a particular case of
Let us note that the nonstandard reals
the above reduced power algebras (6.4). Indeed, ∗R can be deﬁned by
using free ultraﬁlters F on Λ, that is, ultraﬁlters which satisfy (6.10),
or equivalently (6.14).

We note that the ﬁeld of real numbers R can be embedded naturally
in each of the reduced power algebras (6.4), by the injective algebra
homomorphism

(6.16) R ∋ x 7−→ ξx + I ∈ A

where ξx(λ) = x, for λ ∈ Λ. Indeed, if ξx ∈ I and ξ 6= 0, then the
ideal I must contain x1, which means that it is not a proper ideal,
thus contradicting the assumption on it.

For simplicity of notation, we may write ξx = x, for x ∈ R, thus (6.16)
can take the form

(6.17) R ∋ x 7−→ x = ξx + I ∈ A

which in view of the injectivity of this mapping, we may further sim-
plify to

(6.18) R ∋ x 7−→ x ∈ A

13

in other words, to the algebra embedding

(6.18∗) R $ A

There is also the issue to relate reduced power algebras corresponding
to diﬀerent index sets. Namely, let Λ ⊆ Γ be two inﬁnite index sets.
Then we have the obvious surjective algebra homomorphism

(6.19) RΓ ∋ ξ

7−→ ξ| Λ ∈ RΛ

since the elements ξ ∈ RΓ can be seen as mappings ξ : Γ −→ R. Con-
sequently, given any ideal I in RΓ, we can associate with it the ideal
in RΛ, given by

(6.20)

I| Λ = { ξ| Λ | ξ ∈ I }

As it happens, however, such an ideal I| Λ need not always be a
proper ideal in RΛ, even if I is a proper ideal in RΓ. For instance,
if we take γ ∈ Γ \ Λ, and consider the proper ideal in RΓ given by
I = {ξ ∈ RΓ | ξ(γ) = 0 }, then we obtain I| Λ = RΛ, which is not a
proper ideal in RΛ.

We can avoid that diﬃculty by noting the following. Given a ﬁlter F
on Γ which satisﬁes (6.14), that is, F re(Γ) ⊆ F , then

(6.21) F | Λ = { I ∩ Λ | I ∈ F }

satisﬁes the corresponding version of (6.14), namely F re(Λ) ⊆ F | Λ.
Indeed, let us take J ⊆ Λ such that Λ \ J is ﬁnite. Then clearly
Γ \ (J ∪ (Γ \ Λ)) is ﬁnite, hence J ∪ (Γ \ Λ) ∈ F . However, J =
(J ∪ (Γ \ Λ)) ∩ Λ), thus J ∈ F | Λ.
Now in order for F | Λ to be a ﬁlter on Λ, it suﬃces to show that
φ /∈ F | Λ. Assume on the contrary that for some I ∈ F we have
I ∩ Λ = φ, then I ⊆ Γ \ Λ, thus Λ /∈ F .

It follows that

14

(6.22) F | Λ is a ﬁlter on Λ which satisﬁes (6.14) ⇐⇒ Λ ∈ F

In view of (6.19) - (6.22), for every ﬁlter F on Γ, such that

(6.23) Λ ∈ F

we obtain the surjective algebra homomorphism

(6.24) AF = RΓ/IF ∋ ξ +IF 7−→ ξ| Λ +IF| Λ ∈ AF| Λ = RΛ/IF| Λ

and in particular, we have the following relation between the respec-
tive proper ideals

(6.25)

(IF )| Λ = IF| Λ

7. Zero Divisors and the Archimedean Property

It is an elementary fact of Algebra that a quotient algebra (6.4) has
zero divisors, unless the ideal I is prime. A particular case of that
is when a quotient algebra (6.4) is a ﬁeld, which is characterized by
the ideal I being maximal. And in view of (6.5), (6.2), this means
that the ﬁlter F generating such an ideal must be an ultraﬁlter, see
for details [54,55].

On the other hand, none of the reduced power algebras (6.5) which
correspond to ﬁlters satisfying (6.14) are Archimedean. And that in-
cludes the nonstandard reals ∗R as well.

In this regard, let us ﬁrst we note that on reduced power algebras
(6.5), one can naturally deﬁne a partial order as follows. Given two
elements ξ + IF , η + IF ∈ AF = RΛ/IF , we deﬁne

(7.1)

ξ + IF ≤ η + IF ⇐⇒ { λ ∈ Λ | ξ(λ) ≤ η(λ) } ∈ F

Now, with this partial order, the algebra AF would be Archimedean,
if and only if

15

∃ υ + IF ∈ AF , υ + IF ≥ 0 :

∀ ξ + IF ∈ AF , ξ + IF ≥ 0 :

(7.2)

∃ n ∈ N :

ξ + IF ≤ nυ + IF

However, in view of (6.14), we can take an inﬁnite I ∈ F . Thus we
can deﬁne a mapping ω : Λ −→ R which is unbounded from above on
I. And in this case taking ξ + IF = (υ + ω) + IF , it follows easily that
condition (7.2) is not satisﬁed.

We note that the reduced power algebras AF in (6.5) are Archimedean
only in the degenerate case (6.7), (6.8), when in addition the respec-
tive sets I are ﬁnite, thus as noted, the respective algebras reduce to
ﬁnite dimensional Euclidean spaces.

Further we note that the partial order (7.1) on the algebras AF is in
general not a total order. In this regard, we have

Proposition 1.

Proof.

Let F be a ﬁlter on Λ satisfying (6.14). Then the partial order (7.1) is
a total order on the reduced power algebra AF , if and only if F is an
ultraﬁlter. In that case we have AF = ∗R, that is, the reduced power
algebra AF is the ﬁeld ∗R of nonstandard reals.

Let us take any partition Λ = Λ0 ∪ Λ1 into two inﬁnite subsets and
take ξ0, ξ1 : Λ −→ R as the characteristic functions of Λ0 and Λ1,
respectively. Then obviously

(7.3)

{λ ∈ Λ | ξ0(λ) < ξ1(λ)} = Λ1,

{λ ∈ Λ | ξ0(λ) > ξ1(λ)} = Λ0

and in general Λ0, Λ1 /∈ F , like for instance, when F = F re(Λ). Thus
in view of (7.1), in general, we cannot have in AF either of the in-

16

equalities

(7.4)

ξ0 + IF ≤ ξ1 + IF ,

ξ0 + IF ≥ ξ1 + IF

Clearly, no ﬁlter on Λ can simultaneously contain both Λ0 and Λ1, thus
both of the above inequalities (7.4) can never hold simultaneously.

However, in case F is an ultraﬁlter satisfying (6.14), thus we are in the
particular situation when AF = ∗R, that is, the reduced power algebra
AF is the ﬁeld ∗R of nonstandard reals, then according to a property
of ultraﬁlters, we must have either Λ0 ∈ F , or Λ1 ∈ F . Therefore, one
and only one of the above two inequalities in (7.4) holds.

Conversely, let (7.1) be a total order on AF . Then one and only one
of the inequalities (7.4) must hold. Let us assume that it is the case of
the ﬁrst one of them. Then (7.1), (7.3) imply that Λ1 ∈ F . Obviously,
in the other case we obtain that Λ0 ∈ F .

In this way, whenever we are given a partition Λ = Λ0 ∪ Λ1 into two
inﬁnite subsets, one of them must belong to the ﬁlter F .
If on the other hand, in the partition Λ = Λ0 ∪ Λ1 one of the sets is
ﬁnite, then in view of (6.14) the other must belong to the ﬁlter F . And
since Λ is supposed to be inﬁnite, both sets in the partition cannot be
ﬁnite.

Thus we can conclude that the ﬁlter F is indeed an ultraﬁlter on Λ,
since its above property related to partition characterizes ultraﬁlters.

It is shown that if we can deﬁne a physical quantity with proper character in a given inertial
reference frame (kinematic, dynamic, electromagnetic in its nature) which transforms when
detected from a reference frame relative to which it moves with velocity ux as F =

u2
x
c2
then we can derive for it transformation equations following one and the same procedure,
which involves the addition law of relativistic velocities which can be derived without using the
Lorentz transformations. The transformation equation derived that way, generates the physical
quantities uxF and u′
, for which physicists invent names reﬂecting theirs physical meaning.

I. INTRODUCTION

Each chapter of physics operates with fundamental physical quantities. Kinematics is involved with length
and time, dynamics add to them, by tradition, the concept of mass, whereas electromagnetism introduces the
concept of electric charge. Combining fundamental physical quantities we obtain new ones, useful in describing
physical eﬀects.

All chapters of physics have in common the relativistic postulate, due to Galileo and Einstein, according
to which all the true laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers, all of them measuring the value
c for the velocity of light. When measured from diﬀerent reference frames some physical quantities have the
same magnitude (relativistic invariants). If a physical quantity which characterizes an object is measured by an
observer relative to whom the object is in a state of rest, we say that the observer measures its proper value.

An equation which relates physical quantities measured from diﬀerent reference frames, represents a transfor-
mation equation. A transformation equation enable us to derive formulas which account for diﬀerent relativistic
eﬀects. It is considered that the use of the transformation equations reduces the transparency 1,2.

Relativistic equations describing time dilation1,3,4,5,

length contraction and addition of relativistic
velocities1,6,7 can be derived without using transformation equations, all having as a starting point the time
dilation formula. The method works when in one of the involved reference frames a proper physical quantity is
measured.

The purpose of our paper is to show that the transformation equations for kinematic, dynamic and electro-
magnetic physical quantities can be derived using the same strategy, involving the addition law of relativistic
velocities as a single relativistic ingredient, which at its turn is a direct consequence of the time dilation eﬀect7.
Three inertial reference frames are involved S(XOY ), S′(X ′O′Y ′) and So(X oO0Y 0). So moves with velocity
x relative to S′, S′ moving at its turn with velocity v relative to S. The axes
ux relative to S, with velocity u′
of the reference frames are parallel to each other, the OX, O′X ′ and OoX o axes are overlapped and all the
velocities show in theirs positive directions. The three reference frames have the same space-time origins. In
order to keep the problem as simple as possible, we will consider only events which take place on the overlapped
axes. The velocities mentioned above are related by

o located at Oo(to), the mass mo of
a particle located at Oo, the force F o acting on the particle mentioned above and the electric ﬁeld created by a
charged capacitor. Physical quantities like diﬀerent from zero space coordinates, momentum, mechanical power
and magnetic ﬁeld are meaningless in that frame. All the physical quantities measured in So are by deﬁnition
proper physical quantities: proper time reading (date) to, proper mass mo, proper force F o and proper electric
ﬁeld Eo.

II. RELATIVISTIC KINEMATICS

In each of the mentioned reference frames, the clocks located at the diﬀerent points of the overlapped axes are
synchronized following a procedure proposed by Einstein. The proposed scenario makes that at a given point of
o located at Oo meets a clock C(x, y = 0) of the S frame and a clock C′(x′, y′ = 0)
the overlapped axes clock Co
of the S′ frame. Let to, t and t′ be the readings of the three clocks respectively. In accordance with the time
dilation formula the three readings are related by

III. RELATIVISTIC DYNAMICS

Consider that a particle is located at rest at the origin Oo of So. Observers in that frame measure its rest
mass mo. Using the addition law of relativistic velocities it was shown13 that as measured from S the mass of
the particle is

whereas as measured from S′ it is

Equations (19) and (22) put the bane on the concept of relativistic mass as many physicists require8.

A remarkable property of the relativistic energy consists in the fact that a particle at rest is characterized by

Because the single supplementary energy a free particle moving with constant velocity can possess is its kinetic
energy Ek, we have for it

Ek = E − Eo = Eo(γv − 1) = moc2(γv − 1).

The traditional way to derive the equations presented above is to consider a collision between two particles

from two inertial reference frames and imposing that momentum and energy conserve9.

The truth of equation (11) is conﬁrmed by the experiments performed Bucherer10 with electrons moving in
a magnetic ﬁeld, obtaining excellent agreement working with it. This was and continues to be a great proof
in favour of the special theory of relativity in all its ﬁelds, all being the consequence of Einstein’s postulate of
relativity. It is considered10 that to this date no other explanation of Bucherer’s experiment then that supplied
by special relativity, is known.

IV. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS

We consider now a capacitor Co the plates of which are parallel to the X oOoZ o plane, at rest in So and
y , oriented in the positive

charged with electrical charges Q and −Q respectively. It creates an electric ﬁeld Eo
direction of the OoY o axis given by

Q
ε0εrAo ,
Ao representing the surface of one of the plates ε0 and εr representing invariant electrical constants. The
electrical neutrality of atoms convinces us that the electric charge is a relativistic invariant. When detected
from S, the sides of the plate parallel with the overlapped axes undergo a Lorentz contraction and so the electric
ﬁeld measured from S is

respectively, then a transformation equation relating F and F ′ can be derived using the addition law of velocities
as a single relativistic ingredient. The transformation generate a new physical quantity (uF ), (u′F ′) in S
and in S′ respectively for which physicists ﬁnd adequate names and the transformation of which involves the
transformation of F and F ′ and the addition law of velocities.

As compared with the traditional derivations which are very laborious, our derivation is heuristic, being based
on facts known from classical physics, uses simple algebra being time saving having a good relationship between
time invested and understanding achieved.

We consider that it convinces the reluctants about the truth of special relativity.

It does not charge the
memory of the teacher or of the learner, who in the traditional approaches, have to learn in each chapter of
physics, a new scenario.

Abstract

Usually a Riemannian geometry is considered to be the most general ge-
ometry, which could be used as a space-time geometry. In fact, any Rieman-
nian geometry is a result of some deformation of the Euclidean geometry.
Class of these Riemannian deformations is restricted by a series of unfounded
constraints. Eliminating these constraints, one obtains a more wide class of
possible space-time geometries (T-geometries). Any T-geometry is described
by the world function completely. T-geometry is a powerful tool for the micro-
cosm investigations due to three its characteristic features: (1) Any geometric
object is deﬁned in all T-geometries at once, because its deﬁnition does not
depend on the form of world function. (2) Language of T-geometry does not
use external means of description such as coordinates and curves; it uses only
primordially geometrical concepts: subspaces and world function. (3) There
is no necessity to construct the complete axiomatics of T-geometry, because it
uses deformed Euclidean axiomatics, and one can investigate only interesting
geometric relations. Capacities of T-geometries for the microcosm descrip-
tion are discussed in the paper. When the world function and T-geometry
is nondegenerate and symmetric, the particle mass is geometrized, and non-
relativistic quantum eﬀects are described as geometric ones, i.e. without a
reference to principles of quantum theory. When world function is asymmet-
ric, the future is not geometrically equivalent to the past, and capacities of
T-geometry increase multiply. Antisymmetric component of the world func-
tion generates some metric ﬁelds, whose inﬂuence on geometry properties is
especially strong in the microcosm.

Key words: space-time geometry, nondegenerate geometry, geometrization of
mass, quantum eﬀects geometrization, world function, future-past geometric nonequiv-
alence.

1 Introduction

In the case, when the existing theory cannot explain observed physical phenomena,
a choice of an appropriate space-time geometry is the most eﬀective and simplest
method of solution of arising problems. The most reliable and doubtless conceptions
of contemporary theoretical physics: the special relativity theory and the general
relativity theory were created by means of a change of the space-time geometry. It
is a common practice to consider the Riemannian conception of geometry to be the
most general conception of geometry. It is common practice to think that further
development of usual geometry is impossible. To increase the geometry capacities,
some authors tries to provide geometry by such unusual properties as stochasticity
and noncommutativity.

In reality the Riemannian conception of geometry is not the most general con-
ception of geometry. List of geometries, generated by the Riemannian conception
of geometry, is restricted by a series of unfounded constraints. Imposition of these
constraints was generated by a series of historical reasons and cannot be justiﬁed.
For instance, there is no necessity for introducing stochasticity in geometry.
It
is suﬃcient to eliminate some constraints, imposed on the Riemannian geometry.
After elimination of these constraints the motion of particles in such a space-time
geometry becomes to be stochastic automatically [1], although the geometry in itself
remains to be deterministic.

To understand this, let us consider the problem, what is the geometry, in gen-
eral, and the Riemannian geometry, in particular. Well known mathematician Felix
Klein [2] supposed that only such a construction on the point set is a geometry,
where all points of the set have the same properties. For instance, Felix Klein in-
sisted that Euclidean geometry and Lobachevsky geometry are geometries, whereas
the Riemannian geometries are not geometries at all. As a rule the Riemannian
geometries are not uniform, and their points have diﬀerent properties. According to
the Felix Klein opinion, they should be called as ”Riemannian topographies” or as
”Riemannian geographies”.

It is hardly relevant now to discuss the question what is the correct name for
the Riemannian geometry, but it is very important to understand, why Felix Klein
insisted on diﬀerent names for the Euclidean geometry and for the Riemannian one.
The fact is that one can formulate axiomatics (system of axioms), determining the
Euclidean geometry as a self-suﬃcient construction, which does not need auxiliary
means for its construction. There is no axiomatics for the Riemannian geometry.
First, it is very diﬃcult (technically complicated) to construct axiomatics for each
of possible Riemannian geometries. Second, there is no necessity in such axiomatics.
In applications of the Riemannian geometry to the space-time model only relations
between the physical objects (world lines of particles, vectors, etc.) are important.
The geometry in itself is less interesting. All relations of the Riemannian geometry
are obtained as a result of modiﬁcation (deformation) of corresponding Euclidean
relations.

Practically, this deformation is realized by a replacement of inﬁnitesimal Eu-

2

E = ηikdxidxk,

ηik =const by the inﬁnitesimal interval ds2

clidean interval ds2
R =
gikdxidxk, where gik is a function of the point x. Such a replacement is a change
of distances between the points of the space-time, what is a space-time deformation
by deﬁnition. Thus, the Riemannian geometry is not a self-suﬃcient construction
(it has not its own axiomatics). The Riemannian geometry is a deformed Euclidean
geometry. The Riemannian deformation of the space-time, converting Euclidean
geometry to the Riemannian one, form a class of deformations, restricted by a series
of constraints.

In general, any deformation is described by a change of distances ρ between
all pairs of space points. In the case of the space-time this distance may be real
(timelike), or imaginary (spacelike).
It is more reasonable to use the quantity
Σ(P, Q) = 1
2ρ2 (P, Q), known as world function [3]. Here ρ (P, Q) is the distance
between the points P and Q. The world function is real always, and it is very
convenient at description of geometry. The world function contains complete infor-
mation on geometry. This property is the most remarkable property of the world
function. In application to the Euclidean geometry, as a special case of Riemannian
geometry, this property is formulated in the form of a theorem [4, 5, 6], which states
that, if and only if the world function satisﬁes some Euclideaness conditions, formu-
lated in terms of the world function, the corresponding geometry is Euclidean. These
conditions will be written down, as soon as corresponding mathematical technique
is developed. Now it is important only that the Euclideaness conditions contain
references only to the world function and ﬁnite subspaces of the whole space. The
dimension of the space, and all other parameters of the Euclidean geometry are
determined by the form of the world function.

In the case of Euclidean geometry all information on geometry is contained in the
world function. This property remains to be valid also, if the world function does
not satisfy the Euclideaness conditions and the geometry is not Euclidean. Then any
choice of the world function Σ corresponds to some geometry
GΣ. This circumstance
can be interpreted in the sense, that the world function Σ describes deformation of
GΣ,
the Euclidean space, and any deformation Σ corresponds to some geometry
which can be interpreted as a result of the Euclidean geometry deformation.
From this viewpoint the Riemannian geometry is a result of the Euclidean geom-
etry deformation, when the world function between the points x and x′ is determined
by the relation

Σ (x, x′) =

The relation (1.1) describes the Riemannian deformation of the Euclidean space.
This deformation is determined by the dimension n of the space and by the metric
tensor gik, which is a set of n(n + 1)/2 functions of one space point x. Information
contained in these n(n + 1)/2 functions is much less, than information included

3

in one function Σ of two space points x and x′. In other words, the Riemannian
deformation is a deformation of a very special form. This raises the question. What
are foundations for consideration of the Riemannian deformation as the most general
admissible deformation of the space-time? Why the Riemannian geometry is the
most general possible geometry of the space-time?

There are no reasonable foundations for pretention of the Riemannian geometry
to the role of the most general space-time geometry. Consideration of the Rie-
mannian geometry as the unique possible space-time geometry is a delusion which
should be rejected. The question what is the reason of this delusion is important
and interesting. We shall not discuss it, restricting ourselves by the remark that this
delusion is an associative delusion [7]. In other words, it is a delusion of the same
sort, which stimulated the scientiﬁc community to believe the Ptolemaic doctrine
for a long time. In other time (in the middle of XIX century) a delusion of the same
sort stimulated rejection of the idea of non-Euclidean geometry.

As soon as we assume that there are non-Riemannian deformation of the Eu-
clidean geometry, generated more general geometries, than Riemannian ones (we
shall refer to them as T-geometries), the simple and evident idea arises, that many
properties of particles in the microcosm can be explained as speciﬁc properties of the
microcosm geometry. In this connection it is relevant to mention that the special rel-
ativity theory has solved problems of motion with large velocities by means of simple
change of the space-time geometry. The general relativity has solved problems of
relativistic gravitation, changing the Minkowski geometry by the most general Rie-
mannian geometry, connecting the form of geometry with the matter distribution
in the space-time.

Description of nonrelativistic quantum eﬀects can be obtained also by means
a simple change of the space-time geometry [1]. The arising space-time geometry
depends explicitly on the quantum constant. The particle motion in such a geometry
appears to be stochastic (quantum mechanics principles are not mentioned at such
a description of quantum eﬀects). Such an explanation of quantum eﬀects diﬀers
from the conventional quantum-mechanical explanation by absence of any additional
suppositions. One considers simply all possible geometries, generated by arbitrary
deformations (but not only Riemannian ones) of Euclidean geometry. One chooses
among these geometries the geometry which corresponds best to the experimental
data.

As far as the world function as a function of two space points contains much
more information, than the metric tensor components, the capacities of explanation
of diﬀerent eﬀects, reserved in application of T-geometries as space-time geometries,
appear to be much more, than other capacities of explanation, used now in the
elementary particle theory and in the quantum ﬁeld theory. One does not need to
make additional suppositions on properties of physical phenomena in the microcosm.
It is suﬃcient to consider all possible T-geometries and to choose this one, which
agrees with experimental data. Of course, the problem of choosing the appropriate
geometry is not a simple problem, because for its solution one needs to study very
large massive of data. But it is important that there is no necessity to invent

4

anything. It is suﬃcient to investigate the existing data.

From viewpoint of common sense and logic the strategy of the microcosm inves-
tigation, based on the dominating role of geometry seems to be most encouraging.
Besides, this strategy appeared to be successful at construction of special relativity,
general relativity and explanation of nonrelativistic quantum eﬀects.

Idea of the geometry description in terms of only distance is a very old idea.
There were attempts to carry out this program, using so called distance geometry
[8, 9], when some constraints, imposed on the metric of metrical space were removed.
Unfortunately, T-geometry has not been constructed, because external means of
description (in particular, concept of a curve) were used. In previous papers [4, 5, 6]
one considered the symmetric T-geometry, i.e. T-geometry with symmetric world
function Σ(P, Q) = Σ(Q, P ). Such a restriction on the world function Σ(Q, P ) seems
In the present paper one considers non-symmetric
to be usual and conventional.
T-geometry, when the world function is asymmetric. Asymmetric world function
is associated with the situation, when the future and the past are not equivalent
geometrically. One cannot test experimentally, whether the future and the past
are equivalent geometrically, because one can measure the time only from the past
to the future. We do not insist that the future and the past are not equivalent
geometrically. But investigation of geometrical description reserves, hidden in such
an asymmetry, seems to be useful.

The main constraints on the Riemannian deformations are as follows: (1) ﬁxed
dimension, (2) continuity, (3) impossibility of deformation of one-dimensional curve
into a surface, or into a point. These speciﬁc constraints are conditioned by ap-
plication of a coordinate system at the description of Euclidean and Riemannian
geometries. Indeed, any coordinate system has ﬁxed number of coordinates (dimen-
sion). Coordinates change continuously, and this property is attributed to geometry,
because coordinates label the space points. Finally, transformations of coordinates
transform one-dimensional curve to one-dimensional curve, and this property of co-
ordinate system is attributed to geometry in itself.

There are methods of separation of geometric properties on the properties of the
coordinate system. One considers description of geometry in all possible coordinate
systems. The properties common for all these descriptions are properties of the con-
sidered geometry. But there are no coordinate transformations from n coordinates
= n). There are no coordinate transformations, which trans-
to m coordinates (m
form one-dimensional curve to n-dimensional surface (n
= 1), and it is a common
practice to attribute these properties of the coordinate systems to geometry in itself.
Thus, constraints on the means of description are attributed to the geometry
in itself. To remove these constraints, generated by the means of description, one
should remove all external means of descriptions and use the language, which uses
It means that the
only concepts which are attributes of the geometry in itself.
geometry is to be described in terms of subspaces and world functions between
points of these subspaces.

Practically a use of only ﬁnite subspaces of the whole space appears to be suﬃ-
cient. As a result the description of geometry is carried out in terms of ﬁnite number

5

of points and world function between pairs of them. Such a description, which does
not contain any external means of description, will be referred to as σ-immanent de-
scription. The σ-immanent description is convenient in the sense that it admits one
to deal with geometry directly. One does not need to consider coordinate systems
and group of their transformations. Sometimes we shall use the coordinate descrip-
tion to connect σ-immanent description with conventional description of geometry.
But construction of T-geometry is produced in the σ-immanent form.

In the second section the main statements of T-geometry are formulated. Con-
cepts of a multivector, scalar Σ-product and collinearity are introduced in the third
sectioon. The fourth section is devoted to investigation of the tube properties. In the
ﬁfth section one investigates a connection between the particle motion stochastic-
ity and the T-geometry dondegeneracy. The particle dynamics in the nondegenerate
space-time geometry is investigated in the sixth section. Asymmetric T-geometry on
a manifold is investigated in the seventh section. The eighth section is devoted to of
the world function properties in vicinity of coincidence of its arguments. Properties
diﬀerent sorts of curvature tensors are investigated in the nineth section. The tenth
section is devoted to investigation of gradient lines. The nondegeneracy conditions
of the neutral ﬁrst order tube are investigated in the eleventh section. Examples of
the ﬁrst order tubes are considered in the twelfth section.

}
T-geometry of arbitrary Σ-space is obtained as a result of ”deformation of proper
Euclidean geometry”. This point is very important, because axiomatics of arbitrary
T-geometry is very complicated. It is relatively simple only for highly symmetric
spaces. Investigation of arbitrary deformations is much simpler, than investigations
of arbitrary axiomatics. Formally, a work with deformations of Σ-spaces is manip-
ulations with the world function. These manipulations may be carried out without
mention of space deformations.

Description of EGOs by means (2.3) is carried out in the deform-invariant form
(invariant with respect to Σ-space deformations). The envelope function fP n as
a function of arguments wk = Σ (Qk, Lk) , Qk, Lk
does not depend on
the form of the world function Σ. Thus, deﬁnition of the envelope function is
invariant with respect to deformations (deform-invariant), and the envelope function
determines any EGO in all Σ-spaces at once.

S2 cannot. Transition from two-dimensional Euclidean space to three-dimensional
Euclidean space is a space deformation. Thus, deformation of the Σ-space may
destroy the property of EGO of being a curve (2.5).

Application of objects, deﬁned by the property (2.5) for investigation of T-
geometries is inconvenient, because the T-geometry investigation is founded on
deform-invariant methods. Formally, one cannot choose appropriate envelope func-
tion for description of the set (2.5), because the envelope function is deform-invariant,
whereas the set (2.5) is not. Hence, (2.5) is incompatible with the deﬁnition 2.5 of
EGO.

The nonsymmetric T-geometry, considered in this paper can be investigated by
the same methods, as the symmetric one. The world function Σ in the nonsymmetric
T-geometry is presented in the form

where G denotes the symmetric part of the world function Σ, whereas A denotes its
antisymmetric part.

Motives for consideration of nonsymmetric T-geometry are as follows.

In the
symmetric T-geometry the distance from the point P to the point Q is the same
as the distance from the point Q to the point P . In the asymmetric T-geometry it
is not so. Apparently, it is not important for spacelike distances in the space-time,
because it can be tested experimentally for spacelike distances. In the case, when
interval between points P and Q is timelike, one uses watch to measure this interval.
But the watch can measure the time interval only in one direction, and one cannot
be sure that the time interval is the same in opposite direction.

If the antisymmetric part A of the world function does not vanish, it means that
the future and the past are not equivalent geometrically. We do not insist that
this fact takes place, but we admit this. It is useful to construct a nonsymmetric
T-geometry, to apply it to the space-time and to obtain the corollaries of asym-
metry which could be tested experimentally. The symmetrical part of the world
function generates the ﬁeld of the metric tensor gik.
In a like way the antisym-
metric part generates some vector force ﬁled ai. Maybe, existence of this ﬁeld can
be tested experimentally. For construction of nonsymmetric T-geometry one does
not need to make any additional supposition.
It is suﬃcient to remove the con-
straint Σ (P, Q) = Σ (Q, P ) and to apply mathematical technique developed for the
symmetric T-geometry with necessary modiﬁcations.

Besides, there is a hope that nonsymmetric T-geometry will be useful in the
elementary particle theory, where the main object is a superstring. The ﬁrst order
tubes (main objects of T-geometry) are associated with world tubes of strings and
branes. In the nonsymmetric T-geometry antisymmetric variables appear. They are

9

absent in the conventional symmetric T-geometry, but antisymmetric variables are
characteristic for the superstring theory.
Two important general remarks.
1. Nonsymmetric T-geometry, as well as the symmetric one, is considered on
an arbitrary set Ω of points P . It is formulated in the scope of the purely metric
conception of geometry [6], which is very simple, because it uses only very simple
tools for the geometry description. The T-geometry formulated in terms of the world
function Σ and ﬁnite subsets
of the set Ω. Mathematically it
means, that the purely metric conception of geometry uses only mappings

whereas the topology-metric conception of geometry [10, 11, 12] uses much more
complicated mappings (2.5), known as curves
. Both mappings (2.11) and (2.5)
are methods of the geometry description (and construction). But the method (2.11)
is much simpler. It can be studied exhaustively, whereas the set of mappings (2.5)
cannot.

2. The nonsymmetric T-geometry will be mainly interpreted as a symmetric T-
geometry determined by the two-point scalar G (P, Q) with some additional metric
structures, introduced to the symmetric geometry by means of the additional two-
point scalar A (P, Q). For instance, in the symmetric space-time T-geometry the
world line of a free particle is described by a geodesic. In the nonsymmetric space-
time T-geometry there are, in general, several diﬀerent types of geodesics. This fact
may be interpreted in the sense, that a free particle has some internal degrees of
freedom, and it may be found in diﬀerent states. In these diﬀerent states the free
particle interacts with the force ﬁelds, generated by the two-point scalar A (P, Q),
diﬀerently. Several diﬀerent types of geodesics are results of this interaction.

Deﬁnition 2.10 A description is called σ-immanent, if it does not contain any
references to objects or concepts other, than ﬁnite subspaces of the Σ-space and its
world function (metric).

σ-immanence of description provides independence of the description on the
method of description. In this sense the σ-immanence of a description in T-geometry
reminds the concept of covariance in Riemannian geometry. Covariance of some ge-
ometric relation in Riemannian geometry means that the considered relation is valid
in all coordinate systems and, hence, describes only the properties of the Riemannian
geometry in itself. Covariant description provides cutting-oﬀ from the coordinate
system properties, considering the relation in all coordinate systems at once. The
σ-immanence provides truncation from the methods of description by absence of a
reference to objects, which do not relate to geometry in itself (coordinate system,
concept of curve, dimension).

The idea of constructing the T-geometry is very simple. Relations of proper
Euclidean geometry are written in the σ-immanent form and declared to be valid
for any Σ-function. This results that any relation of proper Euclidean geometry
corresponds to some relation of T-geometry.

σ-immanent expression for scalar product (P0P1.Q0Q1) of two vectors P0P1 and

proved as follows.

In the Euclidean geometry the world function is symmetric, and the order of
arguments in the rhs of (3.2) is not essential. In the asymmetric T-geometry the
order of arguments in the rhs of (3.2) is essential. The order has been chosen in
such a way that

((P0P1.Q0Q1) + (Q0Q1.P0P1))

function of Euclidean space. Any two points P0, Pi determine the vector P0Pi. The
relation (3.20) is a σ-immanent expression for the scalar Σ-product (P0Pi.P0Pk)

The condition II determines the space dimension. The condition III describes σ-
immanently the scalar Σ-product properties of the proper Euclidean space. Setting
n, satisfying the condition II, one determines n-dimensional basis
n + 1 points
of vectors in Euclidean space. Relations (3.29), (3.28) determine covariant and
contravariant components of the metric tensor, and the relations (3.27) determine
covariant coordinates of points P and Q at this basis. The relation (3.26) determines
the expression for Σ-function for two arbitrary points in terms of coordinates of these
points. Finally, the condition IV describes continuity of the set Ω and a possibility
of the manifold construction on it. Necessity of conditions I – IV for Euclideaness of
Σ-space is evident. One can prove their suﬃciency [5]. The connection of conditions
I – IV with the Euclideaness of the Σ-space can be formulated in the form of a

The theorem states that it is suﬃcient to know metric (world function) to construct
the Euclidean geometry. Concepts of topological space and curve, which are used
usually in metric geometry for increasing its informativity, appear to be excess in the
sense that they are not needed for construction of geometry. Proof of this theorem
can be found in [5].

This is rather close to the particle Compton wave length.

One can see from (5.12), that this stochasticity is large for the particle of small
mass m = bµ.
It is rather unexpected, because, dealing with general relativity,
one thinks that inﬂuence of space-time geometry on the particle motion does not
depend on its mass. This dependence (5.12) on the particle mass is a corollary of
geometrization of the mass in the nondegenerate T-geometry. Indeed, the geomet-
rical mass µ of the particle can be determined from the shape of the world tube
(5.1). The geometrical mass µ is the distance between the adjacent points Pi and
Pi+1, where the tube radius vanishes. In
GM this radius vanishes everywhere, and
the mass cannot be determined from the shape of the world tube (line).
Geometrization of the particle mass is very important phenomenon, which is

essential for eﬀective description of physical phenomena of microcosm.

6 Particle dynamics in the nondegenerate

space-time geometry

In the Minkowski space-time geometry
GM the particle motion is deterministic, and
one can describe a single particle, writing dynamic equations for its world line. In
GD
GD one uses statistical method
it is impossible due to the world line stochasticity. In
of the particle motion description, when one describes motion of many identical

23

particles. This method is described in details in papers [14, 15]. We consider here
only characteristic features of this method, which are essential for understanding of
geometric origin of nonrelativistic quantum phenomena.

Let us consider in

GM a deterministic dynamic system

Any ideal ﬂuid can be described in terms of wave function [14]. Describing the
action (6.5) in terms of wave function and considering the special case, when the
ﬂuid ﬂow is irrotational and the wave function has only one component, one obtains

The last term in the action (6.6) describes inﬂuence of geometrical stochasticity.
This term contains the quantum constant ~. If one sets ~ = 0 in (6.6), the action
becomes to describe statistical ensemble of free deterministic particles. The action
(6.6) generates nonlinear dynamic equation for the wave function ψ. The dynamic
equation becomes to be a linear diﬀerential equation, provided one sets b0 = ~,
because in this case two last terms in (6.6) compensate each other. Note that
the constant b0 is an arbitrary integration constant, which can take any value, in
particular b0 = ~. After this substitution the action (6.6) takes the form

Now all terms in the action becomes to be quantum, because they contain the
quantum constant. One cannot obtain the action for the statistical ensemble of
deterministic (classical) particles, setting ~ = 0, as it is possible to make in the
action (6.6). One cannot suppress the geometrical (quantum) stochasticity in (6.7),
setting ~ = 0. In the action (6.7) quantum properties (the constant ~) are attributed
to those terms, which are purely dynamic in (6.6), and one cannot indicate the term,
responsible for quantum eﬀects. This is the price which is paid for linearity of the
dynamic equation.

Possibility of compensation of two last terms (dynamic and quantum) in the
action (6.6) is connected by the nonrelativistic character of the Hamiltonian function

25

for a classical particle, which has the form Hnr = mc2 + p2/ (2m) . For instance, if
m2c4 + p2c2
the Hamiltonian function Hnr is replaced by the relativistic one Hr =
identiﬁcation b0 = ~ does not lead to the linear dynamic equation for the wave
function.

p

From geometric viewpoint, the linearity of the dynamic equation for the wave
function is valid only for nonrelativistic case. From this viewpoint it seems to be
doubtful, that the linearity should be used as a principle of the relativistic quantum
theory, although from practical viewpoint the linearity is a very useful property of
dynamic equation.

Thus, removing unfounded constraints on geometry and using space-time geom-
etry
GD, one can freely explain nonrelativistic quantum eﬀects. There is no necessity
to invent and to use quantum principles. Quantum eﬀects appear to be corollary of
quantum (or geometric) stochasticity, generated by nondegenerate character space-
time of geometry.

Properties of the world function (5.8) at the coinciding points (0 < ΣM < σ0)
is of no importance for stochastic behavior of particles, because it depends only
on integral distortion d. From this viewpoint application of methods of diﬀeren-
tial geometry to investigation of the world function properties is useless, because
diﬀerential geometry studies properties of the world function Σ (x, x′) in the limit,
x′. But methods of diﬀerential geometry are useful for investigation of

antisymmetric component A (x, x′) of the nonsymmetric world function. We shall
see that the antisymmetric component A (x, x′) generates ﬁelds in the space-time
In other words,
and generates as a rule additional nondegeneracy of geometry.
A (x, x′) generates not only interaction between particles, but also their additional
stochasticity. In this sense the ﬁelds, generated by A (x, x′), are quantum ﬁelds.

7 Asymmetric T-geometry on manifold

We have considered T-geometry in the coordinate-free form. But to discover a con-
nection between the T-geometry and usual diﬀerential geometry, one needs to intro-
duce coordinates and to consider the T-geometry on a manifold. It is important also
from the viewpoint of the asymmetric T-geometry application as a possible space-
time geometry. The asymmetric T-geometry on the manifold may be considered to
be a conventional symmetric geometry (for instance, Riemannian) with additional
force ﬁelds ai (x), aikl (x), generated on the manifold by the antisymmetric compo-
nent A of the world function. Testing experimentally existence of these force ﬁelds,
one can conclude whether the antisymmetric component A exists and how large it
is.

The considered mappings onto Euclidean spaces can serve as a powerful tool
for description of the Σ-space properties. Let us note in this connection, that the
Riemannian space may be considered to be a set of inﬁnitesimal pieces of Euclidean
spaces glued in some way between themselves. The way of gluing determines the
character of the Riemannian space in the sense, that diﬀerent ways of gluing generate
diﬀerent Riemannian spaces. The way of gluing is determined by the diﬀerence of
the metric tensor at the point x and at the narrow point x + dx, where it has the
forms gik (x) and gik (x + dx) respectively. The metric tensor depends on a point
and on a choice of the coordinate system.
It is rather diﬃcult one to separate
dependence on the way of gluing from that on the choice of the coordinate system.
Nevertheless the procedure of separation has been well developed. It leads to the
curvature tensor, which is an indicator of the way of gluing.

In the case of the Σ-space one considers a set of ﬁnite Euclidean spaces Ex′ (ins-
Ex′. Here the ”way of
tead of its inﬁnitesimal pieces) and a set of mappings Σ
gluing” is determined by the dependence of mapping on the parameter x′. It does
not depend on a choice of the coordinate system. This circumstance simpliﬁes in-
vestigation. Diﬀerentiating the mappings with respect to parameters x′, one derives
local characteristics of the ”way of gluing”, which are modiﬁcations of the curvature
tensor. For instance, considering commutators of derivatives ˜
x
i′, one can
∇
introduce two-point curvature tensor for the Σ-space, as it have been made for the
Riemannian space [16, 17]. We shall see this further.

(See ﬁgures 1,2). In the same time a separation of the tube into internal and external
segments is not symmetric with respect to the reﬂection t
t. This is shown
schematically in the ﬁgures 3,4, where internal segment is drawn by a thick line,
whereas external segments are drawn by thin line. The shape of internal segment,
as well as that of external ones looks rather unexpected. The internal segment

quantum eﬀects and may lead to unexpected phenomena.

Thus, the local antisymmetric structure produces only local perturbation of the
tube shape. At the timelike inﬁnity this perturbation reduces to a nonvanishing
radius of the tube. As we have seen in the ﬁfth section, geometrical stochasticity
depends on the thickness of tube internal segment. Any asymmetry of the world
function increases this thickness and increases stochasticity. It generates additional
nondegeneracy of T-geometry, which is connected with the particle mass geometriza-
tion and with quantum eﬀects [1].

13 Concluding remarks.

The main goal of the nonsymmetric T-geometry development is its possible appli-
cation as a space-time geometry, especially as a space-time geometry of microcosm.
Approach and methods of T-geometry distinguish from those of the Riemannian
(pseudo-Riemannian) geometry, which is used now as a space-time geometry. The
Riemannian geometry imposes on the space-time geometry a series of unfounded
constraints. These restrictions are generated by methods used at the description of
the Riemannian geometry. Let us list some of them.

1. The continuity of space-time. This is a very ﬁne property which cannot be
tested by a direct experiment. T-geometry is insensitive to continuity, and it is
free of this constraint. For application of T-geometry is unessential, whether the
space-time geometry is continuous or only ﬁne-grained.

2. The Riemannian geometry is a geometry with ﬁxed dimension. It is very diﬃ-
cult to imagine a geometry with variable dimension in the scope of the Riemannian
geometry. Such a problem is absent in T-geometry.

45

3. For the Riemannian geometry description, one uses a coordinate system and
the concept of a curve, which are essentially methods of the Riemannian geometry
description. The curve is considered conventionally to be a geometrical object (but
not as a method of the geometry description), and nobody is interested in separation
of properties of geometry from properties imported by a use of the description in
terms of curves. In particular, in the Riemannian geometry the absolute parallelism
is absent, in general. Parallelism of two vectors at remote points is established by
means of a reference to a curve, along which the parallel transport of the vector
is produced. In other words, geometrical property of parallelism of two vectors is
formulated in terms of the method of description, and nobody knows, how to remove
this dependence on the methods of description. T-geometry is free of this defect.
The concept of a curve is not used at the T-geometry construction. There is an
absolute parallelism in T-geometry.

4. T-geometry uses a special geometrical language, which contains only concepts
immanent to the geometry in itself (Σ-function and ﬁnite subspaces). One does not
need to eliminate the means of the geometry description.

5. The geometrical language admits one to consider and to investigate eﬀectively

such a situation, when the future and the past are not geometrically equivalent.

6. The means of the Riemannian geometry description suppress such an im-
portant property of geometry as nondegeneracy. As a corollary the particle mass
geometrization appears to be impossible in the scope of Riemannian geometry. Ge-
ometrization of the particle mass is important, when the mass of a particle is un-
It
known and must be determined from some geometrical or physical relations.
may appear to be important for determination of the mass spectrum of elementary
particles. T-geometry admits geometrization of the particle mass.

7. Consideration of nondegeneracy and geometrization of the particle mass have
admitted one to make the important step in understanding of the microcosm space-
time geometry. One succeeded in explanation of non-relativistic quantum eﬀects as
geometrical eﬀects, generated by nondegeneracy of the space-time geometry. There
is a hope that asymmetry of the space-time geometry will admit one to explain
important characteristics of elementary particles geometrically.

Capacities of T-geometry as a space-time geometry are far in excess of the Rie-

mannian geometry capacities.

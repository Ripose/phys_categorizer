The irreversibility of the equations of classical dynamics (the Hamilton equations and the Liouville
equation ) in the space with multifractal time is demonstrated. The time is given on multifractal sets
with fractional dimensions. The last depends on densities of Lagrangians in a given time moment
and in a given point of space. After transition to sets of time points with the integer dimension the
obtained equations transfer in the known equations of classical dynamics. Production of an entropy
is not equally to zero in space with multifractal time, i.e. the classical systems in this space are
non-closed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The dynamic equations of the physical theories are re-
versible, it is well known. The kinetic equations of the
statistical theory are irreversible. The irreversibility the
Boltzmann’s statistical theory was in due time the main
reason of non-recognition by Poincare of Boltzmann’s
statistical theory. For the irreversibility introducing in
the physical dynamical equations (for example, in the
equation of the Liouville) it is necessary to introduce the
dissipation terms [1], [2] or the functionals of a micro-
scopic entropy and time [3] ensuring realization of the
second law of thermodynamics.
In the ﬁrst case irre-
versibility in the dynamic equations arises as a sequence
of mathematical approaches. Prigogin’s the point of view
is consists in recognizing the primacy of irreversible pro-
cesses and it seems intuitively more reasonable. Are more
general, than mentioned, a methods of introducing of the
irreversibility in the dynamical equations of physics ex-
ist? Is it possible the reversibility of the equations of the
dynamical theories to introduce as result of approximate
transition from more rigorous the dynamical irreversible
equations (these dynamic equations may be obtained as
a result of generalization of the known equations) to
the idealized and reversible, but approximate equations?
The purpose of a note is to introduce one of a possible
generalizations of the dynamical theories of physics real-
ized by replacement of time with topological dimension
equal unity on ”multifractal” time (for the ﬁrst time it
was introduced in [4]). In the mentioned theory the time
is characterized in each time and space points by frac-
tional (fractal) dimensions (FD)dt(r(t), t). The marked
replacement dimension of time by fractional dimensions
gives in the origin of irreversibility in the dynamical equa-
tions of physics and the existence of irreversibility in our
world may be interpreted by new reason. It is not contra-
dicts (for FD is small diﬀers from unity for weak physical
ﬁelds on the Earth) an experimental data, and allows to
receive a new interesting physical results. The equations

of the classical mechanics (the equations of the Hamilton
- Liouville) are chosen for research as an typical example
of dynamic systems.

II. EQUATION OF A MECHANICS WITH TIME

DEFINED ON MULTIFRACTAL SETS

The method of generalization of the classical mechanics
equations is founded on the new model of an approach to
the problem of a nature of time [4].This model is consists
in replacement of usual time by the time deﬁned on a mul-
tifractal subsets st of continuously set Mt (the measure
carrier). The multifractal set St consists of subsets st,
i.e. very small time intervals (in further named ”points”),
which are also multifractal, and each of them is character-
ized in turn by its global fractal dimension FD) dt(r(t), t)
( deﬁned as box-dimension, [5], [6] and so on) that de-
pends of a nature of sets st, and depends at coordinates
and time (see [4], [7]). So each time subset is character-
ized by its global fractal dimension dt(r(t), t) which char-
acterize the scaling characteristics for this subset. The
continuity dt(r(t), t) is supposed. The new approach to a
nature of time is consists in the replacing the usual time
points of time axe by selection for describing of the time’s
intervals (the ”points” on a time axis consisting of sets st
that deﬁned on the measure carrier Mt) only the ”points”
that characterized by sets st. The time axe (or, in other
selections time plane or time volume Rn) is the carrier
of measure of all the multifractal time subsets st deﬁned
on it. The researching of the dynamic equations and
physical quantities (in particular, the entropy) with time
”points” with fractal characteristics deﬁned on multifrac-
tal sets st with FD dt(r(t), t), lead to irreversibility of all
dynamic theories used in physics. It is stipulated by an
openness of dynamic systems with multifractal time (role
of a thermostat plays set Rn) that is appears in a time de-
pendencies of all physical and mathematical (except for
zero) objects. For describing of small changes of func-
tions deﬁned on multifractal time sets, it is impossible

1

to apply ordinary or fractional (in sense of the Riemann
- Liouville) derivatives and integrals, since to diﬀerent
time points there corresponds to diﬀerent fractal dimen-
sions. For describing of changes of such functions need’s
introduction of generalized fractional derivatives and in-
tegrals [4]. In this note the multifractal properties of the
space sets sr are not considered, since the irreversibility
of the dynamic physical equations arises already at the
using only of multifractal time (see also [7])and global
FD of small time sets intervals st.

III. GENERALIZED FRACTIONAL

MULTIFRACTAL SET ST OF TIME POINTS

It is necessary if we want to describe the dynamics of
time-dependent functions determined on multifractal set
St to enter the functionals that extends the fractional
derivatives and integrals of the Riemann - Liouville on
the set St with FD dt(r(t), t)) that is diﬀerent in each
subsets st [4] )

dimensions (FD). The dependencies FD from time and
space coordinates are deﬁned by the Lagrangians’s densi-
ties of a viewed problem [4], [7], [8]. The generalized frac-
tional derivative (GFD) (1)-(2) coincide with fractional
derivatives or fractional integrals of the Riemann - Liou-
ville [9] in the case dt = const. At dt = n + ε(t), ε → 0
GFD are represented by usual derivatives and integrals
[4]. The functions and integrals in (1)-(2) are considered
as generalized functions given on the set of ﬁnitary func-
tions [10]. The deﬁnitions the GFD (1)-(2) allow to de-
scribe the dynamics of functions deﬁned on multifractal
sets and GFD substitute (for such functions) the usual or
fractional diﬀerentiation and integration (GFD partially
conserve the memory about of the last time events).

sical particles with identical masses m on the set with

From the (1) follows, that equation (6) is of the form
(for dt(r(t), t) = 1 + ε(r(t), t), ε → 0, when a simplifying
assumption about lack at dt, ε of explicit dependence
from t is valid)

Ddt

+,tH = ˜Ddt

+,tH =

(7)

and is equal to zero when dt(r(t), t) = 1. So, in space
with multifractal time, at classical system with a Hamil-
tonian H that not depends explicitly at time (conser-
vative systems) the GFD with respect to a total en-
ergy depends on time and decreases with the increases
of time, i.e. in the model of multifractal time the rigor-
ously conservative classical systems does not exist. For
diﬀers dt(r(t), t) from unity by a little bit (that it is valid
about it represents experimental data about time and
results of [4] ) the changing of energy of system will be
very small. Let’s consider the problem of change H with
change of time in more general case (ε = ε(r(t), t)). For
this purpose we shall be restricted to a case, when FD of
time dt(r(t), t) = 1 is not considerably diﬀers from unity:
dt = 1 + ε(r(t), t) = 1, |ε| ≪ 1.
In this case GFD is
represented as [4] (integral is calculated as the total of a
principal value and residue in a singular point)

The selection of signs (plus or minus) in (8)-(9) is deter-
mined by sign of ε and requirements of a regularization
of integrals and selection of FD dt (greater or smaller
unity). Let dt(r(t), t) < 1. In this case from (8) follows

For t → ∞, the basic contribution in the (10) im-
ports corrections proportional to velocity of change FD
dt(r(t), t). The total energy conservative (in sense, that
the Hamiltonian has not an explicit dependence at time
) systems now in space with multifractal time is not con-
servative systems. It changes can be at t → ∞ of any
sign, and depend on a sign of derivatives with respect to
time from the fractional correction to dimension of time
ε. For ε = 0 the total energy of system is conserves and
all relations coincide with known relations following from
the dynamic equations of classical systems mechanics.

V. LIOUVILLE EQUATION

The equation of the Liouville for a N-partial distribu-
tion function ρ(X, t) (X- are coordinate and impulses of
particles of a 6N -dimension phase space) is equivalent to
the Hamilton equations for system from N of classical
particles and is invariant in relation to transformations

ri → ri, pi → −pi,

t → −t,

i = 1, 2, 3, ..N (11)

(equation is reversible). On set St of multifractal time
complete derivative ρ(X, t) will reads:

where Ddt
+,tρ is deﬁned by (1), L-functional of the Liou-
ville and diﬀers from the functional of the known equa-
tion of the Liouville by replacement of ordinary deriva-
tives with respect to time on GFD. For a demonstration
of the irreversibility of expression (12) to transformations
(11) we shall mark the following: the distribution func-
tions ρ(X, t) and ρ(X0, t0) viewed in diﬀerent moments
t0 and t are connected by the relation

ρ(X, t)dX = ρ(X0, t0)dX0

(13)

and ρ(X, t) evolves with a time. Complete derivative
Ddt
+,tρ(X, t), in particular and in that connection, is not
equal to zero.
Intuitively it is clear, that derivative
Ddt
+,tρ(X, t) is determined by a functional from function
ρ(X, t) equal to zero at dt = 1 + ε = 1. Let’s designate
this functional describing change ρ(X, t) owing to inter-
action with ”thermostat”, by ϕ = ϕ0(ρ, dt, t)ε(r(t), t).
The role of the thermostat plays the set Mt (being the
carrier of a measure of a subsets of time points st and
belonging to one of spaces Rn), as was already marked.
The appealing of the functional ϕ is caused not to in-
terior processes happening with change of energy inside
system, but is determined by diﬀerent properties of time
sets st in diﬀerent instant of time (change of dimension
of st with a time changes). Complete derivative in this
case will be equal to a functional ϕ and (12) will reads
as the equation

(14)

The equation (14) is analogous of the Liouville equation
of the classical systems with the time deﬁned on multi-
fractal sets. The analog of a collision integral in a right
member (14) is stipulated by interaction with the carrier
of a measure of multifractal set Mt and is equal’s to zero
if sets of time st is substitutes by sets with topological
dimension equal to unity.

VI. PRODUCTION OF AN ENTROPY

Let’s consider a classical system which is be found
in an equilibrium state at the usual describing of the
time.The production of an entropy in such system is
equal to zero. Let’s consider the production of the en-

tropy S = R ρ(X, t)ℓnρ(X, t)dX of same classical sys-

tem deﬁned on multifractal set of time points St (for
dt = 1 − ε < 1):

Ddt

+,tS = Z Ddt

+,t[ρℓnρ]dX

(15)

Permissible, as well as earlier, that dt = 1 + ε(r(t), t),
|ε ≪ 1|. As ρ(X, t) has for the equilibrium system at
dt 6= 1 the complete GFD which is non-equal zero, the
right member (15) is not equal to zero. It means, that
equilibrium systems does not exist in space with multi-
fractal time. Really, as

that (16) is an inequality and in a case ∂S
∂t = 0. For
∂ε
∂t = 0 the production of the entropy is positive. For

with multifractal time. Last statement corresponds to
mathematical exposition of behavior of physical objects
and not contradict the exposition of the Einstein type
of Universe , in which, in connection with its expansion,
there are no invariable objects;
4. The quantity of the fractional additional to topologi-
cal dimension of time member ε is determined by physical
ﬁelds and depends on the density of energy that presents
in the given moment in the given point of space . At the
small densities of energy the corrections are very small.
So, for the gravitational ﬁelds at distances more larger
that gravitational radius (for example, for FD created by
mass of the Earth on a surface of Earth) and for electric
ﬁelds on atomic distances the value of ε is equal ε ∼ 10−8.
Therefore the multifractal nature of time (dt ∼ 1+ε) does
not contradicts an existing experimental data.

to time with topological dimension equal to unity.

VII. ABOUT CONNECTION FD DT WITH

LAGRANGIANS OF PHYSICAL FIELDS

In the monograph [4] the following approximating con-
nection of fractional dimension of time dt(r(t), t) with a
Lagrangian density L of all physical ﬁelds in a point r(t)
in an instant t (see also [7], [8]) is obtained:

dt(r(t), t) = 1 +Xi

βiLi(r(t), t)

(17)

where βi is dimensional numerical factors ensuring a zero
dimension of products βiLi. In [4] it is shown, that for
coinciding the results founded on the (17) with results
of the theory general relativity (GR) it is necessary (for
gravitational forces) to choose β = 2
c2 (c- speed of light).
For correspondence with results of a quantum mechanics,
for electric ﬁelds the βe has an order of magnitude βe =
(2mc2)−1 (m -is mass of particle or body creating the
electric charge). The small diﬀerences FD from unity is
satisﬁed by condition

βiLi = ε ≪ 1

(18)

Xi

The connection ε with density of Lagrangians adds phys-
ical sense GFD (more in detail about it see [7]) and
renders concrete relations obtained in the previous para-
graphs.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

The present note is devoted to the appendix of idea
of the multifractal time oﬀered in [4] [8], for researching
of the problem of an irreversibility in large classical sys-
tems consisting from an identical objects. The following
results, leading from this paper, on our sight, are essen-
tial:
1. The equations describing behavior of conservative sys-
tems (in usual time), are irreversible in space with mul-
tifractal time;
2. The neglecting by the fractionality of dimension of
time and transition in space with topological dimension
of time equal to unity allows to receive the known re-
versible equations of classical dynamics;
3. In space with the multifractal time there are no invari-
able objects, since the GFD with respect to stationary
values are not equal to zero. From the physical point of
view it is the reﬂection of non-stationary of the Universe

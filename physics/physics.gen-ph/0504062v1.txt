PREFACE

Looking back at theoretical physics of the 20th century, we see two monumental
achievements that changed forever the way we understand space, time, and matter
– the special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. At the dawn of the century,
it became clear that the laws of physics must be radically modiﬁed when dealing with
fast moving objects. This understanding lead to the formulation of special relativity
by Einstein in 1905. At about the same time, it also became clear that old physics
is invalid at the microscopic scale. Thanks to the eﬀorts of Planck, Bohr, Einstein,
Heisenberg, Schr¨odinger, and many others, the non-relativistic quantum mechanics was
born in mid 1920’s. This theory had an enormous success in describing and predicting
properties of atoms, molecules, and condensed matter. Immediately after formulation
of quantum mechanics, theoreticians started to look for ways to unify this theory with
special relativity. Unfortunately, all these attempts stumbled upon serious diﬃculties.
Equations of quantum mechanics resisted casting in the rigid manifestly covariant form
dictated by the Einstein’s theory.

The way around this and other hurdles was found with the advent of quantum
ﬁeld theory (QFT) whose equations were manifestly covariant. This theory achieved
astonishing accuracy in calculations of certain physical observables related to scattering
and energies of bound states. In some instances, the discrepancies between predictions
of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and experiment are less than 0.000000001%. You
will not ﬁnd such an accuracy anywhere else in science! However, in spite of its success,
quantum ﬁeld theory cannot be considered as the ultimate uniﬁcation of relativity and
quantum mechanics. Just too many fundamental questions remain unanswered.

It is fair to say that everyone trying to learn QFT is struck by enormous complexity
of this formalism. A successful physical theory is expected to operate, as much as
possible, with objects having clear interpretation in terms of observed quantities. This
is often not the case in QFT, where such physically transparent concepts of quantum
mechanics as Hilbert space, wave function, particle observables, Hamiltonian, and
time evolution, though not completely discarded, were substituted by more formal and
obscure notions of quantum ﬁelds, propagators, and Lagrangians. Actually, it was
even declared that the concept of a particle is not fundamental anymore and must be
abandoned in favor of the ﬁeld description of nature [1]:

In its mature form, the idea of quantum ﬁeld theory is that quantum ﬁelds
are the basic ingredients of the universe, and particles are just bundles of
energy and momentum of the ﬁelds.

The most notorious failure of QFT is the problem of ultraviolet divergences: To
obtain sensible results from QFT calculations one must drop certain inﬁnite terms.
Although rules for doing such tricks are well-established, they cannot be considered a
part of a mathematically sound theory. As Dirac remarked

7

This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves ne-
glecting a quantity when it turns out to be small – not neglecting it because
it is inﬁnitely large and you do not want it!

Although the formalism of QFT deviates substantially from simple and transparent
rules of quantum mechanics, the radiative corrections (such as Lamb shifts or ana-
malous magnetic moments) calculated in QFT are usually small. Then it appears puz-
zling why such profound changes in our view of the world (virtual particles, non-trivial
vacuum, renormalization, etc.) are required for reproducing such small corrections.

The current consensus is that QFT is a low energy approximation to some yet
unknown truly fundamental theory. There are various guesses about what this ultimate
theory may be. The prevailing opinion is that the ultraviolet divergences are related
to our lack of understanding of physics at short distances. Some think that future
theory will reveal a non-trivial, probably discrete, structure of space (and time?) at
33 cm. Others hope that paradoxes
distances comparable to the “Planck scale” of 10−
will go away if we substitute point-like particles with tiny extended objects, like strings
or membranes. Unfortunately, until this day there was no consistent uniﬁcation of
quantum theory with relativity.

In this book we suggest a better way to formulate the relativistic quantum theory.
Although ideas presented here are valid for any type of particles and interactions, for
simplicity, we will focus on charged particles, photons, and electromagnetic forces. We
call this theory relativistic quantum dynamics or RQD. In contrast to the traditional
formulation of QFT, our approach does not use the concepts of ﬁelds and virtual par-
ticles. The main ingredients of RQD are real particles and instantaneous interaction
potentials acting between them. In this sense it is very similar to the non-relativistic
quantum mechanics, and all familiar notions and methods of the latter still apply in
RQD. In particular, the time evolution of the wave function of a physical system can
be obtained by using a well-deﬁned ﬁnite Hamiltonian, and accurate scattering ampli-
tudes can be calculated from this Hamiltonian by using standard recipes of quantum
theory without encountering embarrassing divergences and without the need for renor-
malization.

There is a widely shared opinion that the Hamiltonian dynamics, familiar from
non-relativistic physics, cannot be used in the relativistic case. This opinion is based
on the common misconception that relativistic laws must be manifestly covariant, e.g.,
the time and space coordinates should be treated symmetrically. An important part of
the theory developed in this book is a critical revision of this concept. We demonstrate
that the manifest covariance does not follow from two Einstein’s postulates of special
relativity and is, in fact, an additional postulate of the theory. Trying to comply with
this postulate was the main obstacle frustrating previous attempts to unify the principle
of relativity with quantum mechanics. Instead of traditional space-time uniﬁcation,
the key idea of our approach to relativity is the uniﬁcation of ten types of inertial

8

transformation (three space translations, three rotations, three boosts, and one time
translation) into one Poincar´e group. By combining this rather old idea with quantum
postulates, using Wigner’s theory of unitary representations of groups and Dirac’s
approach to relativistic interactions, we ﬁnd that boost transformations of observables
in interacting systems of particles are not given by universal linear Lorentz formulas.
Generally, these transformations depend on the state of the system and on interactions
acting there. Thus, the universal manifest covariance is just an approximation. Exact
laws for transformations of observables with respect to time translations and boosts
of inertial observers should be deduced from dynamical properties of the system. In
other words, boosts are dynamical.

The plan of this book is as follows. In chapters 1 and 2 we discuss two diﬀerent
approaches to relativity: the traditional approach which assumes the universality of
Lorentz transformations and the kinematical character of boosts and our approach
which establishes the dynamical character of boosts and describes relativistic eﬀects
without using the Minkowski space-time picture. Our approach relies heavily on the
group properties of transformations between inertial observers.
In chapter 2 we in-
troduce groups most important in physics: the Galilei group, the Lorentz group, and
the Poincar´e group. We also demonstrate how familiar predictions of special relativity
(the slowing-down of moving clocks, the shortening of moving measuring rods, the
relativity of simultaneity, etc.) are encoded in the multiplication law of the Poincar´e
group, when observed objects do not involve interactions.

An elementary introduction to quantum mechanics is presented in chapters 3 and
4. In the quantum mechanical formalism, states are represented as rays in the Hilbert
space and observables are represented as operators in this space. Then the uniﬁcation
of quantum mechanics with the principle of relativity is achieved by using Wigner’s
prescription (see chapter 5): the Hilbert space of the system must carry a unitary
representation of the Poincar´e group. In chapter 6 we will derive operators of physical
observables as generators of the Poincar´e group representation and functions of genera-
tors. In chapter 7, elementary particles will be described in terms of irreducible unitary
representations of the Poincare group. Taking into account the dynamical character of
time translations and boosts, in chapter 8 we arrive to what is known in literature as
the many-particle direct interaction theory in the instant form [2].

The direct interaction theory is perfectly consistent with the relativity principle
and quantum mechanics. However, it is not yet suitable to describe real interacting
systems for two, mainly technical, reasons. First, in this approach it is diﬃcult to
ensure that interactions between particles satisfy the principle of cluster separability.
Second, it is diﬃcult to describe processes of particle creation and annihilation which
are so common in high energy physics. From chapter 9 we start to develop a realistic
theory of interacting charged particles and photons that solves the above problems. In
chapter 9 we discuss general properties of theories in the Fock space where the number
of particles is not ﬁxed and may vary from zero to inﬁnity. The diﬃcult part is the

9

construction of a non-trivial representation of the Poincar´e group acting in the Fock
space. The standard approach to such a construction is given by the quantum ﬁeld
theory which is described in chapter 10. The ﬁeld theoretical description of charged
particles and photons is given by QED presented in chapter 11. In section 11.3 we
discuss the problem of ultraviolet divergences in QED and the partial solution of this
problem by the traditional renormalization approach. This solution is not complete:
although the S-matrix of the renormalized QED is ﬁnite and perfectly agrees with
experiment, the Hamiltonian contains inﬁnite counterterms and cannot be used for
calculations of time-dependent processes. A systematic presentation of the new RQD
approach begins from chapter 12. We show there how ultraviolet divergences can be
completely eliminated from both the Hamiltonian and the S-matrix by performing a
unitary transformation of the QED Hamiltonian to the physically transparent “dressed
particle” form. Thus obtained Hamiltonian of RQD predicts exactly the same S-
matrix as the usual renormalization approach, so the perfect agreement with all existing
experiments is not destroyed. Among the advantages of the new approach is the
extension of the theory to include the description of time evolution in a natural way.
Our theory has a number of surprising predictions. Probably the most controversial
one is the conclusion that electric and magnetic forces propagate instantaneously. You
may ask: “what about the explicit ban on faster-than-light propagation of signals in
special relativity?” The key for resolving this paradox is in correct understanding
of the nature of boost transformations. By accepting the dynamical (dependent on
interactions) character of boosts, we will ﬁnd out that in RQD the instantaneous
interactions and causality are perfectly compatible, and there is no paradox. Our
approach oﬀers a plausible explanation of the apparent superluminal propagation of
evanescent waves in recent experiments [3] (see subsection 12.3.6)

Chapter 13 is devoted to discussion of corrections to the Einstein’s formula for the
decay law of moving unstable particles. Some useful mathematical facts are collected
in the Appendix.

Remarkably, the development of RQD did not require introduction of radically
new physical ideas. Actually, all key ideas of this study were formulated a long time
ago, but for some reason they have not attracted the attention they deserve. For
example, the fact that either translations or rotations or boosts must have dynamical
dependence on interactions was ﬁrst established in Dirac’s paper [2]. These ideas
were further developed by Bakamjian and Thomas [4], Foldy [5], Sokolov [6], Coester
and Polyzou [7], and many others. The “dressed particle” approach was advocated by
Greenberg and Schweber [8]. First indications that this approach can solve the problem
of ultraviolet divergences in QFT are contained in papers by Ruijgrok [9] and Vi¸sinesku
and Shirokov [10]. The “similarity renormalization” idea of G lazek and Wilson [11] is
an important tool for taming the divergences. The formulation of RQD presented in
this book just combined all these right ideas into one comprehensive approach, which,
we believe, is a truly consistent uniﬁcation of quantum mechanics and the principle of

10

relativity.

I would like to express my gratitude to Theo Ruijgrok and Boris Zapol for reading
this book and making valuable critical comments. This book was inﬂuenced a lot
by conversations with William Klink, Wayne Polyzou, Alexander Shebeko, Mikhail
Shirokov, and by newsgroup discussions with Bilge, Bernard Chaverondier, Bill Hobba,
Igor Khavkine, Arnold Neumaier, Dan Solomon, and many others.

RELATIVITY

There are more things in Heaven and on earth,
dear Horacio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy.
Hamlet

Before embarking on systematic study of relativity and quantum mechanics, in this
chapter we want to clearly indicate the diﬀerences between our approach to relativity
and the Einstein’s special relativity theory. We brieﬂy review the key ideas of special
relativity and emphasize the central role played by its “third” tacit postulate pertain-
ing to the kinematical eﬀect of boosts. We point out that this postulate has neither
theoretical nor experimental support and it will not play any role in the theory de-
veloped in this book. Our discussion in this chapter is preliminary, so it necessarily
involves a fair amount of hand waving. However, the issues touched on here will be
elaborated in a more orderly fashion in the later chapters of the book.

1.1 Basics of relativity

1.1.1 The principle of relativity

The essence of the principle of relativity was best explained by Galileo more than 370

”Shut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some
large ship, and have with you there some ﬂies, butterﬂies, and other small
ﬂying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some ﬁsh in it; hang up a
bottle that empties drop by drop into a wide vessel beneath it. With the ship
standing still, observe carefully how the little animals ﬂy with equal speed

to all sides of the cabin. The ﬁsh swim indiﬀerently in all directions; the
drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing something to your friend,
you need to throw it no more strongly in one direction than another, the
distances being equal; jumping with your feet together, you pass equal spaces
in every direction. When you have observed all of these things carefully
(though there is no doubt that when the ship is standing still everything
must happen this way), have the ship proceed with any speed you like, so
long as the motion is uniform and not ﬂuctuating this way and that. You
will discover not the least change in all the eﬀects named, nor could you
tell from any of them whether the ship was moving or standing still. In
jumping, you will pass on the ﬂoor the same spaces as before, nor will you
make larger jumps toward the stern than towards the prow even though the
ship is moving quite rapidly, despite the fact that during the time that you
are in the air the ﬂoor under you will be going in a direction opposite to your
jump. In throwing something to your companion, you will need no more
force to get it to him whether he is in the direction of the bow or the stern,
with yourself situated opposite. The droplets will fall as before into the vessel
beneath without dropping towards the stern, although while the drops are in
the air the ship runs many spans. The ﬁsh in the water will swim towards
the front of their bowl with no more eﬀort than toward the back, and will go
with equal ease to bait placed anywhere around the edges of the bowl. Finally
the butterﬂies and ﬂies will continue their ﬂights indiﬀerently toward every
side, nor will it ever happen that they are concentrated toward the stern,
as if tired out from keeping up with the course of the ship, from which they
will have been separated during long intervals by keeping themselves in the
air.

Let us introduce the notion of inertial laboratories (or simply laboratories, or ob-
servers, or frames of reference) which move uniformly with constant velocities and
without rotation. Then Galileo’s idea can be translated into the statement that all
inertial laboratories cannot be distinguished from the laboratory at rest by perform-
ing experiments conﬁned to that laboratory.
In other words, there is no preferred
frame of reference. Any experiment performed in one laboratory, will yield exactly
the same result as an identical experiment in any other laboratory. The results will
be the same independent on how far apart the laboratories are, and what are their
relative orientations and velocities. Moreover, we may repeat the same experiment at
any time, tomorrow, or many years later, still results will be the same. This allows us
to formulate one of the most important postulates1 in physics

1In this book we will distinguish Postulates which form a foundation of our theory, and cannot be
proven from more general principles, or undoubtedly follow from experiments; Statements which are

1.1. BASICS OF RELATIVITY

21

•

Postulate A [the principle of relativity]:
In all inertial laboratories, the laws
of nature are the same: they do not change with time, they do not depend on the
position and orientation of the laboratory in space and on its velocity.

Of course, the equivalence of observers does not mean that they see the world in
the same way. To convince oneself, it is suﬃcient to go to the deck and observe objects
around the ship. The same object, say, a seagull in the air, will appear quite diﬀerent to
observers from diﬀerent ships. To discuss these diﬀerences, it is convenient to introduce
the notion of inertial transformations of laboratories. Such transformations include

rotations,

space translations,

time translations,

•

changes of velocity or boosts.

If we apply an inertial transformation to a laboratory we obtain another laboratory.
Starting with one laboratory L, any other laboratory can be obtained by applying a
certain combination of inertial transformations to L. So, inertial transformations are
in one-to-one correspondence with laboratories.

1.1.2 Kinematical and dynamical transformations

It is important to realize that inertial transformations may be of two kinds: kinematical
and dynamical. We will call kinematical those transformations which only trivially
change the external appearance of the object and do not inﬂuence its internal state.
For example, two observers at some distance from each other will see the seagull
at diﬀerent distances and from diﬀerent angles. However the internal state of the
seagull will look to them exactly the same: if one observer sees seagull’s wings ﬂapped
down, the translated observer sees the same. So, space translations are kinematical
transformations. Apparently, rotations are kinematical transformations as well. The
description of kinematical translations and rotations is a purely geometrical exercise
and does not require intricate knowledge of the inner composition of the observed
system and involved interactions.

On the other hand, time translations are very diﬀerent in this respect:

for two
observers shifted in time with respect to each other the internal state of the seagull
appears quite diﬀerent: if at one time instant seagull’s wings are down, at other time
they may be up, or the seagull may dive into the water catching ﬁsh, or do any other

true and follow from Postulates; and Assertions which are commonly accepted, but will be shown to
be false.

22

CHAPTER 1. RELATIVITY

thing seagulls normally do. Even if we have a complete description of the object for
one observer, it is extremely diﬃcult to predict the appearance of the same object to
the time translated observer. Such a prediction requires a very detailed knowledge of
how the object is put together and what are the interactions between diﬀerent parts.
We will say that for such a prediction we need to know the dynamics of the object,
and that time translations are dynamical inertial transformations.

So, space translations and rotations are kinematical, and time translations are
dynamical. What about boosts? Are boosts dynamical or kinematical? At ﬁrst sight
boosts look kinematical. Our experience tells us that irrespective of the nature of the
object and interactions, each object just changes its total velocity in the moving frame
of reference: For example, if the seagull ﬂies with velocity w with respect to the ship
S, and the ship S′ moves with velocity v with respect to the ship S, then the velocity
of the seagull with respect to the ship S′ is

w′ = w

v

−
However, let us not forget that our experience is limited to the world in which velocities
of observers and objects are very low. The velocities of the ship and the seagull are just
few meters per second. Even astronauts in a rocket move at just about 8 km/s, which
is nothing compared to the speed of light 300000 km/s. At the end of the 19th century,
Fitzgerald, Lorentz, and Poincar´e noticed that things are not that simple if the relative
velocities of objects and laboratories are very high, i.e., comparable with the speed
of light. The most beautiful investigation of the eﬀects of boosts was undertaken by
Einstein in his famous 1905 article [17]. He added to the relativity postulate A another
statement whose validity has been conﬁrmed by numerous experiments beyond doubt2

•

Statement B [invariance of the speed of light]: The speed of light is independent
on the velocity of the source and observer.

Judiciously applying these two ideas, Einstein arrived to a number of interesting and
surprising conclusions about the eﬀect of boosts on the appearance of objects and

will return to the discussion of the character of boosts (kinematical vs. dynamical) in
section 1.2.

1.1.3 Dilation of time intervals

Consider a light clock oriented along the z-axis (see Fig. 1.1 (a)). From the point
of view of the observer at rest O, the period of the clock is T = 2l/c, where l is the

distance between the mirrors and c is the speed of light. For an observer O′ traveling
with velocity v along the x-direction the clock appears as moving in the opposite
direction. Let us now calculate the clock’s period T ′ from the point of view of O′.

observer. Then the path traveled by the light during one clock period T ′ in the moving

Apparently there is no “correct” answer to the question “what is the period of the

as it appears, and there are good analogies in our everyday experience. For example,

in calculations of relativistic eﬀects. For example, the common relativistic functions of velocity are

the angular size of an object also depends on the observer: the closer is the object
the larger its angular size. Just as the angular size, the duration of time intervals is
a relative (not intrinsic) quantity. The relativity of the angular size seems obvious
because we may freely change our position in space and vary the distance to the object
in a broad range. On the other hand, it is very diﬃcult to ﬁnd fast moving observers
and clocks, so the relativity of time intervals seems counterintuitive.

1.1.4

Length contraction

Now consider the same light clock as in the previous section, this time oriented in the
direction of movement (see Fig. 1.2). Let us demonstrate that for the moving observer
the apparent distance between mirrors changes. We denote this (yet unknown) distance
by l′. Suppose that the light pulse starts traveling from the left mirror at time t = 0.
In order to reach the right mirror (at time t = tf ) the light pulse must travel the
distance l′ between mirrors plus the distance vtf passed by the right mirror during the
time tf

Similarly, the time of travel in the opposite direction tb satisﬁes equation

We will also assume that the clock’s period depends only on the velocity of the observer
and does not depend on the orientation of the clock,4 so the period of the clock shown
in Fig. 1.2 is exactly the same as the period of the clock in Fig. 1.1 (b). Thus we

Solving the set of equations (1.2) - (1.4) we obtain the length contraction formula

The distance between mirrors is cosh θ times shorter in the moving frame of reference!
Thus, the linear size of an object is also a relative property: The linear size looks
diﬀerent for diﬀerent observers, just as the angular size of objects and the duration of
time intervals.

1.1.5 Relativity of simultaneity

Now consider the same light clock oriented as in Fig 1.2, but put the light source in
the middle between the two mirrors, so that it simultaneously sends light signals to
the right and left mirrors. From the point of view of the observer at rest, the light
pulses will reach both mirrors simultaneously. Thus, we have two events5 which are
simultaneous from the point of view of the observer at rest. However, for a moving
observer, it will appear that the light reaches the left mirror earlier than it reaches the
right mirror. In conclusion: events which are simultaneous in one reference frame may
not appear simultaneous in another reference frame!

1.1.6

Lorentz transformations for time and position

Actually, the dilation of time intervals, the shortening of distances, the relativity of
simultaneity and other relativistic eﬀects can be obtained as consequences of a more
general result which connects positions and times of events in diﬀerent reference frames.
If observer O registers an event localized at position (rx, ry, rz) and time t, then the
space-time coordinates of this event measured by the observer O′ moving with velocity
v = (c tanh θ, 0, 0)6 can be obtained by using Lorentz transformations

4This looks like a handwaving. For more rigorous derivation of relativistic eﬀects see section 2.3.
5We will call an event some physical process occurring at certain time in certain well-deﬁned

location, like the light pulse hitting the mirror.

6For simplicity, we consider here only movement along the x-axis. We also assume that at time

The analysis presented in subsections 1.1.3 - 1.1.5 and generalized in eqs. (1.6) -
(1.9) was simple and straightforward because we considered only freely propagating
light pulses, so we could conveniently apply Statement B in our calculations.7 Of
course, our interest is not limited to the laser rays or the light pulse bouncing between
two parallel mirrors. The important question is: “can we extend the above results to
other systems?” At this point we can turn to experiment and observe that predictions
based on Lorentz transformations are still valid when free particles (not necessarily
massless photons) are considered. For example, the relativistic relationship between the
momentum and energy of free particles (including the Doppler eﬀect for photons) was
established with great accuracy in experiments. Reviews of experimental veriﬁcations
of special relativity in systems without interactions can be found in ref.
[18]. From
this we can infer that8

8We will prove Statement C in the framework of RQD in subsection 7.3.7.

1.2. DYNAMICAL CHARACTER OF BOOSTS

27

1.2 Dynamical character of boosts

The goal of any relativistic theory is to describe how diﬀerent observers view real
physical systems made of particles (nuclei, atoms, molecules, etc.) interacting with
each other. However, the statement C is of little help in addressing such systems,
so the boost transformations in the general case cannot be derived so easily. The
fundamental question is: “can we apply equations (1.6) - (1.9) to interacting physical
systems?” or, in other words, “are boosts kinematical?”

1.2.1

Einstein’s special relativity

Einstein’s special relativity is a theory which, in addition to Postulate A and Statements
B and C, makes the following

•

Assertion D [the universality of Lorentz transformations]: Lorentz transfor-
mations (1.6) - (1.9) are exact and universal:
they are valid for all kinds of
events; they do not depend on the composition of the physical system and on the
interaction acting in the system.

It then follows that in special relativity boosts are kinematical: they result in changes
of velocity, length shortening, dilation of time intervals, etc., but all these eﬀects do
not depend on the internal structure and interactions in the objects. Quartz clock and
balance clock will slow down by exactly the same factor predicted in formula (1.1).
Measuring rods made of wood or tungsten will shrink by exactly the same amount
(1.5).

From Einstein’s theory, it also follows that

Assertion E: No signal may propagate faster than the speed of light.

•

The “proof” of this Assertion goes like this. For simplicity, consider the extreme case of
a signal propagating instantaneously, and suppose that such a signal has been sent from
the space-time point A to the space-time point B, so that event A may be described as
the cause and the event B is the eﬀect. These two events are separated by a distance
rAB and occur simultaneously (tAB = 0). So far, there is no contradiction with any
sacred physical principle. The problem arises in the moving frame of reference. There,
according to our discussion in section 1.1.5, the event B may occur before the event
A. For such an observer the eﬀect precedes the cause, which clearly contradicts the
universal principle of causality, and is absurd.

Based on Assertion D, Einstein and Minkowski introduced a bold hypothesis of
the space-time uniﬁcation which lays the foundation of the mathematical formalism of
special relativity. Their logic was as follows: If the boost transformations are universal
then we can say that it is not the measuring rod that shrinks but the space itself; it is

28

CHAPTER 1. RELATIVITY

not the clock that slows down but the time itself. Then transformations (1.6) - (1.9)
describe purely “geometrical” changes of space and time coordinates of events, just as
space translations and rotations simply transform coordinates in the conventional 3D
space. Since Lorentz transformations involve time t, the real geometry of the world
must be a 4-dimensional one with time playing the role of the fourth coordinate. This
is the idea of Minkowski space-time. Minkowski described this uniﬁcation of space and
time in following words:

From henceforth, space by itself, and time by itself, have vanished into the
merest shadows and only a kind of blend of the two exists in its own right.

In analogy with familiar 3D scalars, vectors, and tensors (see Appendix A.2.), special
relativity requires that under boosts all physical quantities transform in a linear “mani-
festly covariant” way, i.e., as 4-scalars, or 4-vectors, or 4-tensors, etc. This requirement
sets very strict limitations on the structure of allowed physical theories:

•

Assertion F [manifest covariance of physical laws, a quote from ref.
Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is transformed into a
law of exactly the same form when, instead of the space-time variables x, y, z, t of
the original coordinate system K, we introduce new space-time variables x′, y′, z′,
t′ of a coordinate system K ′. In this connection the relation between the ordinary
and the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. Or in brief:
General laws of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations.

[19]]:

Einstein did not justify Assertion D in his 1905 paper, and this Assertion is rarely
mentioned in relativity textbooks. All derivations of the Lorentz transformations for
time and position available in the literature (see, e.g., [20] and references cited there)
assume that the motion of particles is uniform and rectilinear. There were no at-
tempts to derive the transformation laws for observables of particles interacting with
each other.9 Nevertheless, the universal (independent on the system and interactions)
character of Lorentz transformations (i.e., Assertion D) is generally accepted. As there
is no solid theoretical support for this statement, one is often referred to experiment
which admittedly conﬁrms the validity of Lorentz transformations with high accuracy.
However, on closer inspection, the experimental situation appears not that certain.
Most experimental veriﬁcations of special relativity [18] were performed in systems
without interactions, e.g., free particles. They include the Michelson-Morley experi-
ment, observations of the transverse Doppler eﬀect, the independence of the speed of

9We present one more derivation of the Lorentz transformation formulas for free particles in sub-
section 2.3.3 of this book. We also discuss there the reasons why this and other derivations cannot
work for interacting particles. The rigorous proof of the interaction dependence of boost transforma-
tions of particle observables is given in the Currie-Jordan-Sudarshan theorem discussed in subsection
12.3.2.

1.2. DYNAMICAL CHARACTER OF BOOSTS

29

light on the speed of the source, the mass-energy-momentum relationship for relativis-
tic particle, etc. Experimental data about relativistic systems with interactions are
rather scarce. One notable exception is the decay of fast moving unstable particles.
Although, the slowing down of such decays conﬁrms the Einstein’s time dilation for-
5 [21], this speciﬁc example does not allow us to
mula (1.1) with the accuracy of 10−
extend Assertion D to all interacting systems.10

Assertion D is a critical juncture in formulation of special relativity. It separates
perfectly legitimate discussions of light pulses, freely moving particles, and associated
events from the generalization of linear Lorentz transformations to all physical systems
and eventual uniﬁcation of space and time in one 4-dimensional continuum. Without
proper justiﬁcation of the Assertion D two latter statements remain unsupported, and
the entire formalism of Einstein’s special relativity becomes suspicious.

1.2.2 A new approach to relativity

As theoretical and experimental support of the Assertion D is rather weak, there is
one very strong argument against this Assertion. To understand this argument let
us note that two inertial transformations made in succession make another inertial
transformation. So, it is rather obvious, and accepted in all treatments of relativity,
that inertial transformations form a group (see subsection A.1.1). The structure of this
group is also well known: this is the Poincar´e group (see section 2.2). Transformations
of reference frames must be reﬂected in transformations of values of observed physical
quantities. This means that inertial transformations of observables of any physical
system must form a representation of the Poincar´e group.11 We already established that
representations of space translations and rotations are kinematical (i.e., independent
on interactions), and that the representation of time translations is dynamical. Then
the structure of the Poincar´e group demands that (see subsections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3)

Statement G: Boosts are dynamical

•

Although this Statement is a radical deviation from special relativity, it is by no means
new. The necessity of the dynamical character of some inertial transformations (beyond
time translations) was formulated by Dirac in 1949 [2] and is well-known in the theory
of particles and nuclei. The new insight presented in this book is the realization

10In chapter 13 we will demonstrate that RQD predicts small deviations from the Einstein’s time

dilation formula in this case.

11This is, actually, the central idea in our approach to relativity: The key to understanding the
relativistic invariance is not the uniﬁcation of space and time but the uniﬁcation of ten types of
inertial transformations of observers (time translations, space translations, rotations, and boosts)
into the Poincar´e group. Changes of inertial observers induce transformations of observables which
form a representation of the Poincar´e group. These transformations are not necessarily linear as in
Assertion F : they depend on the observed system, its state, and on interactions acting in the system.

30

CHAPTER 1. RELATIVITY

that space translations and rotations must remain kinematical and that Statement
G implies that Lorentz transformations (1.6) - (1.9) are not exact and universal. If
interaction in the physical system is weak, the Lorentz formulas (1.6) - (1.9) may
still serve as a good approximation in the classical (non-quantum) limit. However,
even if corrections to these formulas are small, their dependence on the nature of
observed physical system does not allow us to treat boost transformations as simple
re-parameterization of space-time points. Then the ideas of the 4D Minkowski space-
time and of the manifest covariance of physical laws (Assertion F ) become invalid.
The Assertion E becomes suspicious as well. These issues will be discussed in more
detail in section 12.3.

In this book, we try to unify quantum mechanics with the relativity principle with-
out adopting the controversial Assertion D. Instead, we will emphasise the Poincar´e
group structure of inertial transformations. The theory developed in this book predicts
some curious eﬀects which, nevertheless, do not contradict any experimental observa-
tions. For example, our approach implies that two clocks based on diﬀerent physical
processes (e.g., an electronic clock and a balance clock) may slow down by slightly
diﬀerent factors and two measuring rods made from diﬀerent materials (e.g., wood and
tungsten) may shrink in slightly diﬀerent ways when viewed from the moving frame
of reference. You may ask: “If clocks of diﬀerent types show diﬀerent time in the
moving frame of reference, how can we compare the time measurements of diﬀerent
observers?” The answer is that, ideally, we should avoid using clocks with interacting
parts, because it is rather diﬃcult to exactly predict their rate for moving observers.
We should only use non-interacting clocks like that shown in Fig. 1.1. Then the rates
of such clocks in diﬀerent moving frames of reference are related by simple formula
(1.1). The same considerations apply to measuring rods: In our theoretical construc-
tions, we will always use non-interacting systems for measuring distance, e.g., just two
small non-interacting objects resting at a distance of 1m from each other. For such
“measuring rods”, formula (1.5) is exactly valid.

INERTIAL TRANSFORMATIONS

This subject has been thoroughly worked out
and is now understood. A thesis on this topic,
even a correct one, will not get you a job.
R.F. Streater

As we discussed in the previous chapter, there are many inertial observers who have
equal rights, but view the world in diﬀerent ways (from diﬀerent angles, diﬀerent
distances, etc.). An important part of physics is ﬁnding the connections between these
diﬀerent points of view. If we know the description of events by observer O, we would
like to be able to ﬁnd how another observer O′ describes the same events. Probably the
most important and challenging task of this kind is the description of dynamics or time
evolution, i.e., when observer O′ is related to O via translation in time. The crucial
role in solving these problems is played by the recognition that inertial transformations
between diﬀerent observers form a group.

Our task in this chapter is to formulate the properties of the group of transfor-
mations between inertial observers.1 We start with the study of the group of inertial
transformations in non-relativistic physics (the Galilei group) in section 2.1. This is
a relatively easy task, because we can use our everyday experience from the world of
low velocities. The relativistic group of transformations is approached in section 2.2
as a formal generalization of the Galilei group. We will ﬁnd that there is basically
a unique way to modify the commutation relations of the Galilei Lie algebra which
makes them dependent on the speed of light and, at the same time, preserves the
correct non-relativistic limit. This is how we obtain the Lie algebra of the Poincar´e
group without using Statement B (the invariance of the speed of light). In section 2.3

1Here we will be using some basic concepts of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. A reader

unfamiliar with these ideas is referred to Appendix A.3.

mations. We choose an arbitrary observer O as our reference observer, then other
examples of observers are

formation

which connects O and O′

{

O′ =

~φ1; v1; r1; t1}
This general transformation can be represented as a product of basic transformations
(i) - (iv). As basic transformations generally do not commute, we need to choose a
canonical order in this product. For our purposes the following choice is convenient

O

~φ1; v1; r1; t1}

This means that in order to obtain observer O′ =
O we ﬁrst shift
observer O in time by the amount t1, then shift the time-translated observer by
the vector r1, then give it velocity v1, and ﬁnally rotate the obtained observer by
the angle ~φ1.

Transformations in the Galilei group depend smoothly on ten real parameters, so it is
obviously a Lie group. According to our discussion in Appendix A.3, we can obtain the
basis (

with respect to the parameters of one-parameter subgroups, e.g., for time translations

Suppose that observer O performs an inertial transformation with the group element h
(e.g., h is a translation along the x-axis). We want to ﬁnd a transformation h′ which is
related to the observer O′ in the same way as h is related to O (i.e., h′ is the translation
along the x′-axis belonging to the observer O′). As seen from the example in Fig. 2.1,
the transformation h′ of the object A can be obtained by ﬁrst going from O′ to O,
performing translation h there, and then returning back to the reference frame O′

Similarly, if
then

A

is a generator of an inertial transformation in the reference frame O,

is “the same” generator in the reference frame O′ = gO.

Let us consider, for example, the eﬀect of rotation around the z-axis (g = eJ

zφ) on

generators of the Galilei group. We can write

2.1.4 Space inversions

We will not consider physical consequences of discrete transformations (inversion and
time reversal) in this book.
It is physically impossible to prepare an exact mirror
image or a time-reversed image of a laboratory, so the relativity postulate has nothing
to say about such transformations. Indeed, it has been proven by experiment that the
symmetries with respect to these transformations are not exact. Nevertheless, we will
ﬁnd it useful to know how generators behave with respect to space inversions. Suppose

sign after inversion. For example,

2.2. POINCAR ´E GROUP

2.2 Poincar´e group

41

When we derived the commutation relations of the Galilei algebra in the previous
chapter, we used some “common sense” ideas about how inertial transformation may
aﬀects parameters (positions, velocities, etc.) of events. We can be conﬁdent about
results obtained for space translations, time translations and rotations, because we
experience these transformations in everyday life over a wide range of parameters.
Things are quite diﬀerent with boosts. As discussed in subsection 1.1.2, our experience
was acquired in the world of low velocities. Therefore our arguments leading to the
commutation relations involving boost generators may be not exact, and these formulas
may be just approximations that can be tolerated only for low-velocity observers. In
this section we will derive the exact commutators and ﬁnd the generalization of the
Galilei group which is valid for all velocities. This new group is called the Poincar´e
group.

2.2.1 Poincar´e Lie algebra

We will base our derivation of the Poincar´e Lie algebra on the following ideas.

(I) Just as in the non-relativistic world, the set of inertial transformations must
remain a 10-parameter Lie group. However, the commutation relations in the
exact Lie algebra are expected to be diﬀerent from commutators in the Galilei
Lie algebra (2.7) - (2.14).

(II) The Galilei group does a good job in describing the low-velocity transformations,
and the speed of light c is a natural measure of velocity. Therefore we may guess
that the correct commutators should include c as a parameter, and they must
tend to the Galilei commutators in the limit c

.5

→ ∞

(III) We will assume that only commutators involving boosts may be subject to revi-

sion.

(IV) We will further assume that relativistic generators of boosts ~
K

nents of a true vector, so eqs. (2.9) and (2.21) remain valid.

still form compo-

Summarizing requirements (I) - (IV), we may write the following relativistic general-
izations of the commutators (2.12) - (2.14)

5Note that here we do not assume that c is a limiting velocity or that the speed of light is invariant
(Statement B). These facts will come out as a result of application of our approach (see subsection
7.4.1).

This set of commutators is called the Poincar´e Lie algebra and it diﬀers from the

In spite of their simplicity, eqs (2.27) - (2.34) are among the most important equations
in physics, and they have such an abundance of experimental conﬁrmations that one
cannot doubt their validity. We therefore accept that the Poincar´e group is the true
mathematical expression of relationships between diﬀerent inertial laboratories.

6This relationship can be obtained from the condition that boost transformations along given axis

form one-parameter subgroups, e.g.,

eKxcθ1eKxcθ2 = eKxc(θ1+θ2)

The rapidity parameter changes from zero to inﬁnity, and the corresponding velocity changes from
v(0) = 0 to v(
) = c. This indicates that boost transformations cannot force observer to move faster
than the speed of light.

Lorentz transformations

In the previous section we derived the commutation relations of the Poincar´e Lie al-
gebra. These commutators will play an important role in our development of the
relativistic quantum dynamics later in this book. It is interesting to note that these
commutators also allow us to derive all results of special relativity for non-interacting
classical (non-quantum) objects. The idea of this derivation is based on the fact that
such objects move uniformly in space along straight lines. Hence, if we disregard the
spinning motion of these objects, we can associate inertial frames of reference with
them. Then the distances between objects, their relative velocities and orientations, as
well as time intervals between corresponding events can be obtained from parameters
of inertial transformations between associated reference frames.

2.3.1 Time dilation

Consider the identity

e−K

xcθeH

xcθO = eH

t cosh θ+

P

which follows from eq. (2.37). The left hand side can be interpreted as the following
sequence of transformations of the observer at rest O:

1. jump to the reference frame moving with velocity c tanh θ along the x-axis;

2. wait time t (measured by the clock of the moving observer)

3. jump back to the reference frame at rest

The right hand side tells us that this sequence of transformations is equivalent to

1. wait time t′ = t cosh θ (from the point of view of the observer at rest O);

2. shift by the distance ct sinh θ = ct′ tanh θ

Apparently, the time elapsed from the point of view of the observer at rest is cosh θ
times greater than from the point of view of the moving observer. This agrees with
our observation in subsection 1.1.3 that a moving ideal clock goes cosh θ times slower
than the clock at rest.

The left hand side describes the following sequence of transformations

1. jump to the reference frame moving with velocity c tanh θ along the x-axis;

2. instantaneously shift by the distance l (according to the measuring rod of the

moving observer) along the x-axis;

3. jump back to the reference frame at rest

From the point of view of the observer at rest this is equivalent to the translation
by the distance l cosh θ and shift in time by l
c sinh θ. Here we see the relativity of
the simultaneity. Both ends of the measuring rod of length l in the moving frame
of reference were taken at the same time instant. However, when viewed from the
frame at rest, there is a time diﬀerence of l
c sinh θ. For this reason, it is not correct
to say that the moving measuring rod has the length of l cosh θ when viewed from O,
because both ends are not taken at the same time instant. So, we need to correct
the position of the far end of the measuring rod by subtracting (velocity)
(time
( l
diﬀerence) = (c tanh θ)
c sinh θ). Then the correct length of the measuring rod from

Lorentz transformations for time and position

Finally, let us derive the boost transformations of space and time coordinates of events.
Consider an event E which occurs at space-time point [t, r] from the point of view of
the observer O. We are going to ﬁnd the parameters of this event from the point of
view of the moving observer O′ where

It should be stressed that Lorentz transformations (2.43) - (2.46) were derived
based on the assumption that considered objects are non-interacting, so that we could
associate inertial reference frames with them. We cannot repeat the same procedure
for interacting objects, because their movement is not uniform, and inertial reference
frames cannot be attached to them permanently.

In the literature one can ﬁnd many derivations of the Lorentz transformation formu-
las (2.43) - (2.46) which use approaches diﬀerent from ours (see, e.g., [20] and references
cited there). On closer inspection, these derivations cannot be applied to space-time
coordinates of events associated with interacting objects or particles. Existing at-
tempts to generalize the proofs to arbitrary interacting systems look unconvincing.
For example, it is sometimes said that if two events coincide in space and time in one
frame of reference, they must also coincide in space and time in all other frames of
reference. Then, if non-interacting events obey the Lorentz transformation rules (1.6)
- (1.9), all other events must also obey the same rules. This argument may sound
plausible, but it is completely arbitrary. Sometimes an assumption is made that two
observers moving with respect to each other must see exactly the same events. They
may disagree only about the space-time coordinates of the events. For example, if one
observer sees an explosion, another observer also must see exactly the same explosion,
probably in a diﬀerent location and at a diﬀerent time. Clearly, this is just the Asser-
tion D in disguise. Some try to justify the linearity of the boost transformations for

2.3. LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS

53

interacting particles by assuming the homogeneity and isotropy of space. This argu-
ment is not valid as well. Suppose that we have two interacting particles A and B at
some distance from each other. Suppose that we want to derive boost transformations
for the observables of the particle A. Clearly, for A diﬀerent directions in space are
not equivalent: For example, the direction pointing to the particle B is diﬀerent from
the opposite direction. So, the hypothesis of the spatial isotropy fails.

Therefore we cannot expect to have simple transformations laws for events in in-
teracting systems. We will see in subsection 12.3.2 that boost transformations of the
time and position of events associated with interacting particles are non-linear and
interaction-dependent.

THE NATURE OF QUANTUM
UNCERTAINTIES

The nature of light is a subject of no material
importance to the concerns of life or to the practice
of the arts, but it is in many other respects extremely
interesting.
Thomas Young.

In chapters 1 and 2 we assumed that parameters of events and objects (position, veloc-
ity, etc.) can be simultaneously measured with inﬁnite precision. These assumptions
look innocent for macroscopic bodies described by classical mechanics. However, they
are not applicable to microscopic objects like electrons, nuclei, or atoms. A dissatis-
faction with the classical theory started to grow in the beginning of the 20th century.
At that time physicists stumbled upon serious diﬃculties when they tried to apply this
theory to microscopic phenomena, such as the radiation spectrum of heated bodies,
the discrete spectrum of atoms, or the photo-electric eﬀect.

Solutions of these and many other problems were found in quantum mechanics
whose creation involved combined eﬀorts and passionate debates of such outstanding
scientists as Bohr, Born, de Broglie, Dirac, Einstein, Fermi, Fock, Heisenberg, Pauli,
Planck, Schr¨odinger, Wigner, and many others. The picture of the physical world
emerging from these eﬀorts was weird, paradoxical, and completely diﬀerent from the
familiar classical picture. However, despite this paradoxality, the predictions of quan-
tum mechanics are tested countless times everyday in physical and chemical labora-
tories around the world, and not a single time were these “weird” predictions found
wrong, which makes quantum mechanics the most successful and accurate physical
theory of all times.

Figure 3.1: Image in camera obscura with pinhole aperture is created by straight light
rays: the image at point A′ on the photographic plate is created only by light rays
emitted from point A and passed straight through the hole.

3.1 A thought experiment with pinhole camera

The inadequacy of classical concepts is best seen by analyzing the debate between
the corpuscular and wave theories of light. Let us demonstrate the essence of this
centuries-old debate on an example of a thought experiment with pinhole camera.

3.1.1 Corpuscular theory of light

You probably saw or heard about a simple device called camera obscura or pinhole
camera. You can easily make this device yourself: Take a light-tight box, put a photo-
graphic plate inside the box, and make a small hole in the center of the side opposite
to the photographic plate (see Fig. 3.1). The light penetrating through the hole inside
the box creates a sharp inverted image on the photographic plate. You will get even
sharper image by decreasing the size of the hole, though the brightness of the image
will become lower, of course. This behavior of light was well known for centuries (a
drawing of the camera obscura was found in Leonardo da Vinci’s papers). One of
the earliest scientiﬁc explanations of this and other properties of light (reﬂection, re-
fraction, etc.) was suggested by Newton. In modern language, his corpuscular theory
would explain the formation of the photographic image like this:

Corpuscular theory: Light is a ﬂow of tiny particles (photons) propa-
gating along straight lines (light rays). Each particle in the ray carries a
certain amount of energy which gets released in a very small volume corre-
sponding to one grain of the photographic emulsion and produces a small
dot image. When intensity of the source is high, there are so many parti-
cles, that we cannot distinguish their individual dots. All these dots merge

into one continuous image and the intensity of the image is proportional to
the number of particles hitting the photographic plate during the exposure
time.

Let us continue our experiment with the pinhole camera and decrease the size of
the hole even further. The corpuscular theory would insist that smaller size of the hole
must result in a sharper image. However this is not what experiment shows! For a very
small hole the image on the photographic plate will be blurred. If we further decrease
the size of the hole, the detailed picture will completely disappear and the image will
look like one diﬀuse spot (see Fig. 3.2), independent on the form and shape of the light
source outside the camera. It appears as if light rays scatter in all directions when they
pass through a small aperture or near a small object. This eﬀect of the light spreading
is called diﬀraction and was discovered by Grimaldi in the middle of the 17th century.
The diﬀraction is rather diﬃcult to reconcile with the corpuscular theory. For
example, we can try to save this theory by assuming that the light rays deviate from
straight paths due to some interaction with the shield material surrounding the hole.
However this is not a satisfactory explanation. The most striking evidence of the fallacy
of the naive corpuscular theory is the eﬀect of light interference discovered by Young
in 1802 [22]. To observe the interference we can slightly modify our pinhole camera

corpuscular theory is a superposition of images created by the left (L) and right (R)
holes; (b) Actual interference picture: In some places the density of the image is higher

(destructive interference).

by making two small holes close to each other, so that their diﬀraction spots on the
photographic plate overlap. We already know that when we leave the left hole open
and close the right hole we get a diﬀuse spot L (see Fig. 3.3(a)). When we leave open
the right hole and close the left hole we get another spot R. Let us try to predict what
kind of image we will get if we open both holes.

Following the corpuscular theory and simple logic we might conclude that particles
reaching the photographic plate are of two sorts: those passed through the left hole and
those passed through the right hole. When the two holes are opened at the same time,
the density of the “left hole“ particles should add to the density of the “right hole”
particles and the resulting image on the photographic plate should be a superposition
L+R of the two images (full line in Fig. 3.3(a)). Right? Wrong! This “reasonable”
explanation disagrees with experiment. The actual image has new features (brighter
and darker regions) called the interference picture (full line in Fig. 3.3(b)).

Can the corpuscular theory explain the interference picture? We could assume,
for example, that some kind of interaction between light corpuscles is responsible for

3.1. A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT WITH PINHOLE CAMERA

59

the interference. However, this idea must be rejected. For example, in an interference
experiment conducted by Taylor in 1909 [23], the intensity of light was so low that only
one photon was present at a time, and any photon-photon interaction was impossible.
Another “explanation” that the photon somehow splits and passes through both holes
and then rejoins again at the point of collision with the photographic plate does not
stand criticism as well: One photon never creates two dots on the photographic plate,
so it is unlikely that it can split during propagation. Can we assume that the particle
passing through the right hole somehow “knows” whether the left hole is open or
closed and adjusts its trajectory accordingly? Of course, there is some diﬀerence of
force acting on the photon near the left hole depending on whether the right hole is
open or not. However by all estimates this diﬀerence is negligibly small.

3.1.2 Wave theory of light

The inability to explain such basic eﬀects of light propagation as diﬀraction and in-
terference was a major embarrassment for the Newtonian corpuscular theory. These
eﬀects as well as all other properties of light known before quantum era (reﬂection,
refraction, polarization, etc.) were brilliantly explained by the wave theory of light
advanced by Grimaldi, Huygens, Young, Fresnel, and others. The wave theory grad-
ually substituted the corpuscular theory in the 19th century.
It found its strongest
support from the Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory which uniﬁed optics with electric
and magnetic phenomena and explained that the light wave is actually an oscillating
ﬁeld of electric E(x, t) and magnetic B(x, t) vectors – a sinusoidal wave propagating
with the speed of light. According to the Maxwell’s theory, the energy of the wave,
and consequently the intensity of light I, is proportional to the square of the amplitude
E2. Then the Maxwell’s wave theory would
of the ﬁeld vector oscillations, e.g., I
explain the formation of the image on the photographic plate as follows:

∝

Wave theory: Light is a continuous wave or ﬁeld propagating in space
in undulatory fashion. When the light wave meets molecules of the photo-
emulsion, the charged parts of the molecules start to vibrate under the
inﬂuence of the light’s electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors. The places with
higher amplitudes of the ﬁelds, and consequently higher vibration ampli-
tudes of molecules, will have the brighter image.

The diﬀraction and interference are quite naturally explained by the wave theory.
Diﬀraction simply means that the light waves can deviate from the straight path and go
around corners, just like sound waves do.1 To explain the interference, we just need to

1The wave corresponding to the visible light has a very small wavelength between 0.4 micron for
the violet light and 0.7 micron for the red light, so for large obstacles or holes, the corpuscular theory
of light works ﬁne.

60

CHAPTER 3. THE NATURE OF QUANTUM UNCERTAINTIES

(E1+E2)2 = E2

note that when the portions of the wave that passed through diﬀerent holes meet each
other on the photographic plate, their electric vectors add up. However the intensity
of the combined wave is not necessarily equal to the sum of intensities of the waves:
I1+I2. It follows from simple geometric
I
considerations that in the two-hole conﬁguration there are places on the photographic
plate where the two waves always come in phase (E1(t)
E2 > 0, which
means constructive interference), and there are other places of destructive interference
E2 < 0).

3.1.3

Low intensity light and other experiments

In the 19th century physics, the wave-particle debate was decided in favor of the wave
theory. However, further experimental evidence showed that the victory was declared
prematurely. To see what goes wrong with the wave theory, let us continue our thought
experiment with the interference picture created by two holes, and gradually tune down
the intensity of the light emitted by the light source. At ﬁrst, nothing interesting will
happen: we will see that the brightness of the interference picture predictably decreases.
However, after some point we will recognize that the image on the photographic plate
is not uniform and continuous as before. It consists of small bright dots as if some
grains of photo-emulsion were exposed to light and some not. This observation is
very diﬃcult to reconcile with the wave theory. How a continuous wave can produce
this dotty image? However this is exactly what the corpuscular theory would predict.
Apparently the dots are created by particles hitting the photographic plate one at a
time.

A number of other eﬀects were discovered at the end of the 19th century and in
the beginning of the 20th century which could not be explained by the wave theory of
light. One of them was the photo-electric eﬀect: It was observed that when the light
is shined on a piece of metal, electrons can escape from the metal into the vacuum.
This observation was not surprising by itself. However it was rather puzzling how the
number of emitted electrons depended on the frequency and intensity of the incident
light. It was found that only the light with the frequency above some threshold ω0
was capable of knocking out the electrons from the metal. The radiation with the
frequency below ω0 could not produce the electron emission even if a high intensity
light was used. According to the wave theory “explanation” above, we may assume
that the electrons are knocked out of the metal due to some kind of force exerted on
them by the wave. The larger wave amplitude (= light intensity) naturally means the
larger force and the larger chance of the electron emission. Then why the low frequency
but high intensity light could not do the job?

In 1905 Einstein explained the photo-electric eﬀect by bringing back Newtonian
corpuscles in the form of “light quanta” later called photons. He described the light
as “consisting of ﬁnite number of energy quanta which are localized at points in space,

3.1. A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT WITH PINHOLE CAMERA

61

which move without dividing, and which can only be produced and absorbed as complete
units” [24]. According to the Einstein’s explanation, each photon carries the energy of
¯hω, where ω is the frequency of the corresponding electromagnetic wave and ¯h is the
Planck constant. Each photon has a chance to collide with and pass its energy to just
one electron in the metal. Only high energy photons (those corresponding to high fre-
quency light) are capable of passing enough energy to the electron to overcome certain
energy barrier Eb between the metal and the vacuum. No matter what is the ampli-
tude (= number of photons) in the low-frequency (= low energy) light, the photons
of such light are just too “weak” to kick the electrons with suﬃcient energy.2 In the
Compton’s experiment (1923) the interaction of light with electrons could be studied
with much greater detail. And indeed, this interaction more resembled a collision of
two particles rather than shaking of the electron by a periodic electromagnetic wave.
These observations clearly lead to a conclusion that the light is a ﬂow of particles
after all. But what about the interference? We already agreed that the corpuscu-
lar theory had no logical explanation of this eﬀect. So, young quantum theory had
an almost impossible task to reconcile two apparently contradicting classes of exper-
iments with light: Some experiments (diﬀraction, interference) were easily explained
with the wave theory while the corpuscular theory had serious diﬃculties. Other ex-
periments (photo-electric eﬀect, Compton scattering) could not be explained from the
wave properties and clearly showed that light consists of particles. Just adding to the
confusion, de Broglie in 1924 advanced a hypothesis that such particle-wave duality is
not speciﬁc to photons. He proposed that all particles of matter – like electrons – have
wave-like properties. This “crazy” idea was soon conﬁrmed by Davisson and Germer
who observed the diﬀraction and interference of electron beams in 1927.

Certainly, in the ﬁrst quarter of the 20th century, physics faced the greatest chal-

lenge in its history. This is how Heisenberg described the situation [25]:

I remember discussions with Bohr which went through many hours till very
late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of the
discussion I went alone for a walk in the neighboring park I repeated to
myself again and again the question: Can nature possibly be as absurd as
it seemed to us in those atomic experiments?

2Actually, the low-frequency light may lead to the electron emission when two or more low-energy
photons collide with the same electron, but such events have very low probability and become observ-
able only at very high light intensities.

CHAPTER 3. THE NATURE OF QUANTUM UNCERTAINTIES

3.2 Basics of measurements and experiments

In this section we will formulate two basic postulates which make the foundation of
quantum mechanics, and explain the main diﬀerence between classical and quantum
views of the world. To understand quantum mechanics, we must accept that certain
concepts which were taken for granted in classical physics can not be applied to micro-
objects like photons and electrons. To see what is diﬀerent, we must revisit basic ideas
about what is physical system, how its states are prepared, and how its observables
are measured.

3.2.1

Laboratories, physical systems, observables

We obtain all information about physical world from measurements. Generally speak-
ing, the act of measurement requires the presence of at least three objects (see Fig. 3.4):
a preparation device, a physical system, and a measuring apparatus. The preparation
device P prepares the system S in a certain state. The state of the system has certain
attributes or properties. If an attribute or property can be assigned a numerical value
it will be called observable. Measurements of the observables are made by bringing the
system into interaction with the measuring apparatus. The result of the measurement
is a numerical value of the observable F , which is a real number f . Clearly this value
depends on the kind of the system being measured and on the state of this system.3
We assume that every measurement of F gives some value f , so there is no misﬁring
of the measuring apparatus. We will call observer O a collection of measuring ap-
paratuses which are designed to measure all possible observables. Laboratory (P, O)
is a full experimental setup, i.e., a preparation device P plus observer O with all his
measuring apparatuses.

Preparation devices and measuring apparatuses in modern experimental physics can
be rather sophisticated. It would be hopeless to include in our theoretical framework
a detailed description of their design, and how they interact with the physical system.
Instead, we will use an idealized description of both preparation and measurement
acts. In particular, we will assume that the measurement is being performed with a
black box whose job is to produce just one real number - the value of an observable
- upon interaction with the physical system. There are only two things we would
like to stress at this point. First, the value of any observable is a real number.4

3We emphasize this fact because there are numerical quantities in physics which are not associated
with any physical system, therefore they will not be called observables. For example, the number of
space dimensions (3) is not an observable. Time is also not an observable. We cannot say that time
is a property of a physical system. It is rather an attribute of the measuring apparatus, or, more
exactly, an attribute of the clock associated with the measuring apparatus, which assigns a certain
time label to each measurement (see subsection 7.3.7).

4This means that we are not considering compound observables yet. So, for example, we will

Second, we will assume exact measurability of any observable. Of course, this claim
is an idealization. Clearly, there are precision limits in all measuring apparatuses.
However, we will assume that with certain eﬀorts we can always make more and more
precise measurements, so the precision is, in principle, unlimited. As this statement is
important for future discussions, we formulate it as a postulate

•

Postulate I [unlimited precision]: Each observable can be measured with any
prescribed precision.

Sometimes an observable can take a value anywhere on the real axis R. Components
of position Rx, Ry, and Rz are good examples of such observables. However there are
observables for which this is not true and the allowed values form only a subset of the
real axis. Such a subset is called the spectrum of the observable. For example, we know
from special relativity that the absolute value of velocity cannot exceed the speed of
light c, so the spectrum of each component of velocity is [
c, c]. Both position and
velocity have continuous spectra. However, it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd observables having
a discrete spectrum. For example, the number of particles in the system (which is also

observable. The importance of this limitation in quantum theory will become clear later.

a valid observable) can only take values 0, 1, 2, ... Later we will also meet observables
whose spectrum is a combination of discrete and continuous parts.

3.2.2

Ensembles and experiments.

In our above discussion we considered just one act of preparation and measurement.
However, releasing one photon will not make a photograph and ﬁring just one bul-
let is not the way to perform a shooting exercise. Every experimental study requires
repetition of the preparation-measurement cycle. In classical physics, multiple mea-
surements are desirable, e.g., to determine the statistical distribution of results and
estimate experimental errors. However, as we will see later, quantum physics is an
inherently probabilistic approach, and it requires accumulation of statistics as a neces-
sary part of each experiment. We will call experiment the preparation of an ensemble
(= a set of identical copies of the system) and performing multiple measurements of
the same observable in the same conditions. Each member of an ensemble must be
prepared in a separate laboratory. Of course, we should use inertial laboratories, since,
due to the Postulate A, in this case we can guarantee the same conditions for each
It is worth noting here that we are not considering
measurement in the ensemble.
repeated measurements performed on the same copy of the physical system. Once
the measurement has been performed, the prepared copy of the system should be dis-
carded. Each measurement requires a fresh copy of the physical system. This means
that we are not interested in the state to which the system may have “collapsed” after
the measurement.

Suppose we had N inertial laboratories in which we prepared an ensemble of N
identical copies of the system and measured the same observable N times. We cannot
say a priori that all these measurements will always produce the same results. However,
it seems reasonable to assume the existence of ensembles in which measurements of
one observable can be repeated with the same result inﬁnite number of times. Indeed,
there is no point to talk about an observable, if there are no ensembles in which it can
be prepared and observed with certainty.

•

Postulate J: For any observable F and any value f from its spectrum, we can
always prepare an ensemble in such a state that measurements of this observable
are reproducible, i.e., always yield the value f .

The postulates I and J are valid in both classical and quantum mechanics. How-
ever, our goal is to ﬁnd places where these two disciplines are diﬀerent. It appears that
the fundamental diﬀerence is in two additional assertions of classical mechanics: si-
multaneous measurability and determinism. These assertions look innocent for familiar
objects in the macroscopic domain, but they are no longer valid in the micro-world.5

5Actually, it is fair to say that they are equally wrong in the macro-world as well. Simply the

3.2.3

Simultaneous measurability and determinism in classi-
cal mechanics

The ﬁrst additional statement of classical mechanics enhances the postulate I about
unlimited accuracy of measurement and asserts that we can accurately measure several
observables simultaneously.

•

Assertion Ic [simultaneous measurability]: It is possible, in principle, to mea-
sure simultaneously any combination of observables with any prescribed accuracy.

In classical mechanics this statement is so obvious that it is rarely mentioned at all,
though it lies in the basis of the entire mathematical formalism of the theory. Consider
for example a bullet ﬁred from a gun. If we disregard the spinning motion and the
orientation of the bullet in space, then there are six parameters describing the state of
the bullet: its position r and momentum p. According to the assertion Ic, these ob-
servables can be measured accurately and simultaneously. Therefore an instantaneous
in a 6-dimensional phase space,
state of the bullet can be described as a point
.
and the time development of this state can be described by the trajectory
}
Assertion Ic refers to an individual preparation-measurement act. What can we
say about many measurements in the ensemble? We already mentioned that often
results of measurements performed in the ensemble are not reproducible, even if each
individual measurement can be inﬁnitely accurate. For example, even if we do our best
in taking the aim, still bullets ﬁred from a gun will hit diﬀerent places on the target
with diﬀerent momenta. Each bullet has its own trajectory in the phase space. Then
we will say that the ensemble of bullets is in a mixed state described by a probability
distribution or probability density ρ(r, p) on the phase space.

{

In classical physics, these probabilities, are not a cause of concern, because we be-
lieve that the uncertainties simply result from our insuﬃcient control over the prepa-
ration of the states of the bullets. We believe that with certain eﬀorts we can always
control the alignment of the gun’s barrel, the amount of powder in the cartridge, wind,
etc., so that each shot will hit exactly the same place on the target with the same
momentum. This means that the ensemble can be prepared in a state (which will be
called pure classical state) whose probability density is squeezed into a delta-function
ρ0(r, p) = δ(r
p0), and all bullets in the ensemble will follow the same
trajectory. This belief in orderly deﬁniteness and predictability of physical events is
captured in the second additional postulate of classical mechanics, which is a stronger
version of the postulate J

deviations are rather small and not easy to observe in macro-systems on the background of relatively
large experimental errors, e.g., due to temperature.

66

CHAPTER 3. THE NATURE OF QUANTUM UNCERTAINTIES

Classical mechanics is a theory based on the two assertions Ic and Jc. This is a fully
deterministic theory in which one can, in principle, obtain a full information about
the system at any given time and knowing the rules of dynamics predict exactly its
development in the future. This belief was best expressed by Laplace:

An intelligence that would know at a certain moment all the forces existing
in nature and the situations of the bodies that compose nature, and if it
would be powerful enough to analyze all these data, would be able to grasp
in one formula the movements of the biggest bodies of the Universe as well
as of the lightest atom.

3.2.4 Quantum case

The situation in the micro-world is diﬀerent and it is described by quantum mechanics
that can be deﬁned as a theory which respects two postulates I and J, but does not
assume the validity of classical assertions Ic and Jc. The idea that Ic may be invalid, and
for some pairs of observables accurate simultaneous measurements may be impossible
was ﬁrst advanced by Heisenberg.
In particular, he discussed the impossibility of
an accurate measurement of both position and momentum of a micro-particle with a
powerful microscope. He put forward the following arguments. In order to determine
the position of the particle we must register at least one photon scattered by the
particle. Then the accuracy of the measurement cannot be better than the wavelength
of the used light. The measurements of momentum are not perfect either, because
collisions with photons would deﬁnitely disturb the particle and alter its momentum
(e.g., due to the Compton eﬀect).
If we want to get more accurate results for the
position we must use the light with a shorter wavelength whose photons are more
energetic, and therefore perturb the particle’s momentum even stronger. So, better
accuracy for the position means worse accuracy for the momentum and vice versa.
It is impossible to obtain accurate values of both position and momentum in one
measurement. Such pairs of observables are called incompatible.6

This discussion suggests that we must reject the assertion Ic in our construction of

quantum theory and that

•

Statement Iq [incompatibility of observables] : There is an accuracy limit with
which certain pairs of incompatible observables can be measured simultaneously.

6There is a good analogy for incompatible quantum observables in the classical macroscopic do-
main. We cannot determine exactly and simultaneously the frequency of a sound and the time the
sound was made. To have a deﬁnite frequency, the sound must have an inﬁnite duration, so its time
is completely undeﬁned. On the other hand, a short sound is composed of waves in a broad range of
frequencies.

3.2. BASICS OF MEASUREMENTS AND EXPERIMENTS

67

This is the ﬁrst major point where quantum mechanics deviates from classical mechan-
ics.

If we reject the simultaneous measurability of all observables, how we can be sure
that the system really has deﬁnite values of all these observables? In classical me-
chanics, we may still rely on the assertion Jc which allows us to know simultaneous
values of all observables in each individual system even if the simultaneous measure-
ments were not performed. To achieve that, we can prepare an ensemble of identical
particles in a pure classical state and for each copy perform a measurement of any one
observable from the set. E.g., one time we measure position and next time we mea-
sure momentum, etc. This is a kind of cheating because, in fact, we do not measure
diﬀerent observables simultaneously, but since the ensemble is pure we can be sure
that all measurements of any given observable will yield exactly the same answer each
time, which in turn strongly suggests that each individual system in the ensemble has
deﬁnite values of all observables.

A striking fact about nature is that she does not allow such a cheating!

It ap-
pears that, strictly speaking, classical pure ensembles do not exist. In the experiment
described above, at least one observable will not show the same value in repeated mea-
surements. So, the assertion Jc must be rejected. Then the second major statement
which distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical mechanics follows:

•

Statement Jq [indeterminism] :
measurements of all observables are exactly reproducible.

It is impossible to prepare ensemble in which

Quantum mechanics says that with certain eﬀorts we can prepare an ensemble in such
a state that measurements of the position would yield the same result each time, but
then results for the momentum would be diﬀerent all the time. We can also prepare
(another) ensemble in a state with certain momentum, then the position will be all
over the place. We cannot prepare an ensemble in which the uncertainties of both
position ∆r and momentum ∆p are zero (see discussion of the Heisenberg uncertainty
relationship in subsection 7.3.3).

68

CHAPTER 3. THE NATURE OF QUANTUM UNCERTAINTIES

3.3

Is quantum mechanics a complete theory?

Let us review the important conclusions made in the previous section.
In classical
mechanics, we have postulates of simultaneous measurability (Ic) and determinism (Jc).
These postulates express the idea that each physical system has a set of well-deﬁned
properties, attributes, and observables attached to it. Therefore, in classical mechanics,
each state of a system can be described by the full collection of its properties, e.g., as
a point in the phase space which moves along well-deﬁned and predictable trajectory.
This is what can be called a complete description of the system.

It appears that for micro-systems the assertions Ic and Jc are no longer valid and
we cannot guarantee the simultaneous measurability and determinism. Therefore we
cannot say that the system has all its properties at the same time and the complete
classical description by the points and trajectories in the phase space should be substi-
tuted by certain incomplete probabilistic description. This is the essence of quantum
mechanics.

Let us illustrate this by two examples. We know from experience that each photon
passing through the hole in the camera obscura will hit the photographic plate at
some point on the photographic plate. Quantum mechanics allows us to calculate
the probability density for these points, but apart from that, the behavior of each
individual photon appears to be completely random. Quantum mechanics does not
even attempt to predict where each individual photon will fall.

Another example of such apparently random behavior is the decay of unstable
nuclei. The nucleus of 232T h has the lifetime of 14 billion years. This means that in
any sample containing thorium, half of all 232T h nuclei will decay after 14 billion years.
In principle, quantum mechanics can calculate the probability of the nuclear decay as
a function of time by solving Schr¨odinger equation.7 However, quantum mechanics
cannot even approximately guess when any given nucleus will decay. It could happen
today, or it could happen 100 billion years from now.

Although, such unpredictability is certainly a hallmark of microscopic systems it
would be wrong to think that it is not aﬀecting our macroscopic world. Quite of-
ten the eﬀect of random microscopic processes can be ampliﬁed to produce a sizable
equally random macroscopic eﬀect. Thus, looking at marks left by photons on the
photographic plate or hearing clicks of a Geiger counter, we are witnessing truly ran-
dom events whose exact description and prediction is beyond capabilities of modern
science. Another famous example of the ampliﬁcation of quantum uncertainties is the
thought experiment with the “Schr¨odinger cat” [26].

it
We see that quantum mechanics does not describe what actually happened;
describes the full range of possibilities of what might have happened and the probability

3.3.

69

of each possible outcome. Each time nature chooses just one possibility from this range,
while obeying the probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics. This observation
is a bit disturbing and embarrassing.
Indeed, we have real physically measurable
parameters for which we have no control and no power to predict the outcome. These
are facts without an explanation, eﬀects without a cause. It seems that microscopic
particles obey some mysterious random force. Then it is appropriate to ask what is
the reason for such stochastic behavior of micro-systems? Is it truly random or it just
seems to be random? If quantum mechanics cannot explain this random behavior,
maybe there is a deeper theory which can? In other words, is quantum mechanics
a complete theory? There are basically two conﬂicting answers widely discussed in
literature: the “Copenhagen interpretation” and the “realistic interpretation”.

3.3.1 Copenhagen interpretation

The Copenhagen interpretation was advanced primarily by Bohr and Heisenberg. The
logic behind their approach is as follows. As we saw in the example with the “Heisen-
berg’s microscope”, each act of measurement requires an “interaction” between the
measured system and the measuring apparatus. This interaction necessarily disturbs
the system, therefore, we cannot know exactly which properties the system “really”
had before the measurement. We can only know the properties of the system in contact
with the measuring apparatus. The Copenhagen school postulated that this interac-
tion is universal, unavoidable, and has a random unpredictable eﬀect on the result of
measurement.

As real properties of the system always escape observation, the classical idea that
each individual system possesses a certain collection of properties or deﬁnite values
of observables should not be in the foundation of our theory. The correct way is to
describe the state of each individual system as a mix or superposition of all possible
properties, each with its own probability. The electron or photon or unstable nucleus
can be imagined as a cloud of probability or a wave function evolving in time according
to certain rules, e.g., the Schr¨odinger equation. The act of measurement consists of
interaction between the measuring apparatus and this probability cloud. Such inter-
action always selects just one possibility among multiple choices present in the wave
function. The cloud collapses to a point and the probability becomes a certainty due to
an unpredictable interaction between the quantum particle and the classical measur-
ing device. So, observables do not have certain values before the measurement. Their
values are created during the measurement process.

In a short phrase, the Copenhagen interpretation claims that the probabilistic be-
havior is an intrinsic characteristic of an individual system. The probabilistic behavior
of the ensemble is just a reﬂection of this uncontrollable probabilistic behavior of in-
dividual systems, and quantum mechanics is a complete theory.

70

CHAPTER 3. THE NATURE OF QUANTUM UNCERTAINTIES

3.3.2 Realistic interpretation

Einstein was the most outspoken critic of the Copenhagen interpretation and a propo-
nent of an alternative “realistic interpretation”. He wrote:

I think that a particle must have a separate reality independent of the mea-
surements. That is an electron has spin, location and so forth even when
it is not being measured. I like to think that the moon is there even if I am
not looking at it.

In the “realistic” approach to quantum mechanics, each system is supposed to have
deﬁnite values of all its observables at each time whether we measure them or not,
just as in good old classical mechanics. Measurements just reveal these values.
In
the realistic approach, each member of the ensemble moves along some deterministic
trajectory in the phase space, and the quantum mechanical probabilistic description
applies to the ensemble rather than to individual system. Then why ensembles do
not behave predictably? Researchers from this school attribute this fact to some yet
unknown “hidden” variables, which are currently beyond our observation and control.
According to the “realistic” views, put somewhat simplistically, each photon in camera
obscura has a guiding mechanism which directs it to a certain predetermined spot on
the photographic plate. Each unstable nucleus has some internal “alarm clock” ticking
inside. The nucleus decays when the alarm goes oﬀ. The behavior of quantum systems
just appears to be random to us because so far we don’t have a clue about these
“guiding mechanisms” and “alarm clocks”.

According to the “realistic” interpretation, quantum mechanics is not the ﬁnal
word, and future theory will be able to fully describe the properties of individual
systems and predict events without relying on chance.

3.3.3 A third way

Both Copenhagen and realistic interpretations of quantum mechanics have serious
problems. If we adopt the Copenhagen interpretation and describe an individual par-
ticle by its wave function, then it is not clear how this wave function “knows” when it
can undergo a continuous evolution described by the Schr¨odinger equation and when
it should make the sudden “collapse”? Where is the boundary between the measuring
device and the quantum system? For example, it is customary to say that the photon
is the quantum system and the photographic plate is the measuring device. However,
we may take a diﬀerent position and include the photographic plate together with the
photon in our quantum system. Then, we can, in principle, describe both the photon
and the photographic plate by a joint wave function. When does this wave function
collapse? Where is the measuring apparatus in this case? Human’s eye? Does it mean

3.3.

IS QUANTUM MECHANICS A COMPLETE THEORY?

71

that while we are not looking, the entire system (photon + photographic plate) re-
mains in a superposition state? If we stick with the Copenhagen interpretation to the
end, we may easily reach an absurd conclusion that the ultimate measuring device is
human’s brain and all events remain potentialities until they are registered by mind.
The realistic interpretation has its own problems. So far nobody was able to build
a convincing theory of hidden variables, and there are reasons to believe that a simple
theory of that sort does not exist. One serious reason to be unsatisﬁed with the realistic
approach is provided by the way we formulated the postulates of quantum mechanics
I and J as generalization of classical postulates Ic and Jc. Quantum mechanics simply
abandons the unsupported claims of simultaneous measurability and determinism. So,
quantum mechanics with its probabilities is a more general mathematical construction,
and classical mechanics with its determinism can be represented as a particular case
of this general theory (see section 7.3). As Mittelstaedt put it [27]

...classical mechanics is loaded with metaphysical hypotheses which clearly
exceed our everyday experience. Since quantum mechanics is based on
strongly relaxed hypotheses of this kind, classical mechanics is less intuitive
and less plausible than quantum mechanics. Hence classical mechanics, its
language and its logic cannot be the basis of an adequate interpretation of
quantum mechanics.

One can also take a third position which is somewhat intermediate between the re-
alistic and Copenhagen interpretations. On the one hand, in agreement with Einstein,
we can admit that each individual system has certain values of all observables with
or without measurement. On the other hand, we can agree with Bohr and Heisen-
berg that reality is often unpredictable. This position was best explained (though not
shared) by Einstein himself [28]:

I now imagine a quantum theoretician who may even admit that the quantum-
theoretical description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual
systems, but who, nevertheless, clings to the idea that the type of description
of the statistical quantum theory will, in its essential features, be retained
in the future. He may argue as follows: True, I admit that the quantum-
theoretical description is an incomplete description of the individual system.
I even admit that a complete theoretical description is, in principle, think-
able. But I consider it proven that the search for such a complete description
would be aimless. For the lawfulness of nature is thus constructed that the
laws can be completely and suitably formulated within the framework of our
incomplete description. To this I can only reply as follows: Your point of
view - taken as theoretical possibility - is incontestable.

72

CHAPTER 3. THE NATURE OF QUANTUM UNCERTAINTIES

In the rest of this book we will try to stay out of this fascinating philosophical
debate and follow the fourth approach to quantum mechanics attributed to Feynman:
“Shut up and calculate!”

QUANTUM MECHANICS

If all the past were present, and the present existed
along with the future, who would be able to distinguish,
where are the causes and where are the consequences?
Kozma Prutkov

In the previous chapter we discussed two basic ideas of quantum mechanics: the lack of
simultaneous measurability and the lack of determinism. The next step is to translate
these general ideas into working mathematical formalism. I do not know a better way
of doing that than the approach called quantum logic. This opinion is shared by Foulis
[29]

In introductory quantum physics classes (especially in the United States),
students are informed ex cathedra that the state of a physical system is
represented by a complex-valued wavefunction ψ, that observables corre-
spond to self-adjoint operators, that the temporal evolution of the system
is governed by a Schr¨odinger equation, and so on. Students are expected
to accept all this uncritically, as their professors probably did before them.
Any question of why is dismissed with an appeal to authority and an injunc-
tion to wait and see how well it all works. Those students whose curiosity
precludes blind compliance with the gospel according to Dirac and von Neu-
mann are told that they have no feeling for physics and that they would
be better oﬀ studying mathematics or philosophy. A happy alternative to
teaching by dogma is provided by basic quantum logic, which furnishes a
sound and intellectually satisfying background for the introduction of the
standard notions of elementary quantum mechanics.

The main purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate that the postulates of quan-
tum mechanics are robust and inevitable consequences of the laws of logic and basic

73

74

CHAPTER 4. QUANTUM MECHANICS

properties of measurements. Therefore, in our quest for relativistic quantum theory
it is unlikely that the “quantum” part will deviate from its currently accepted form.
Then, the only chance to avoid diﬃculties mentioned in the Preface is to have a fresh
look at the “relativistic” part of the traditional theory.

Basic postulates of quantum logic which are common for both classical and quan-
tum mechanics are presented in section 4.1. It appears that all diﬀerences between the
two theories are concentrated in just one postulate. In classical mechanics, this is the
postulate of distributivity (see section 4.2). In quantum mechanics, this postulate is
substituted by the orthomodular law. In section 4.3, we will demonstrate how postu-
lates of quantum logic lead directly to the familiar formalism of quantum mechanics
with Hilbert spaces, Hermitian operators, wave functions, etc.

4.1

Lattice of propositions.

The initial idea that the fundamental diﬀerence between classical and quantum me-
chanics lies in their logical structures belongs to Birkhoﬀ and von Neumann. The
formalism presented in this section summarizes their seminal work [30] as well as fur-
ther research most notably by Mackey [31] and Piron [32].

4.1.1 Pure and mixed states

The key elements of quantum logic are special observables called propositions. A
proposition x is a statement about physical system which can be either true or false.
So, propositions can be also deﬁned as observables whose spectrum consists of just two
points: 1 (if x is true) and 0 (if x is false). As an example we can consider propositions
x about one observable F . They are of the form ”the value of observable F is inside
subset X of the real line.” When measurement of F is done, the proposition x may be
found either true (if the value of F was found inside the subset X) or false (otherwise).
If several observables F1, F2, . . . , Fn are simultaneously measurable, then there are
propositions corresponding to subsets in the (n-dimensional) common spectrum of
these observables. Note that propositions have a direct physical interpretation. For
example, the proposition “particle’s position is inside volume V ” can be realized using
a Geiger counter occupying the volume V . The counter clicks (the proposition is
true) when the particle passes through the counter’s chamber and does not click (the
proposition is false) when the particle is outside of V .

As with any other observable, the measurements of propositions are associated with
uncertainty. So, we can introduce a function (φ
x) called the probability measure which
assigns to each state φ of the physical system and each proposition x the probability
of x to be true in the state φ. This function is a directly measurable quantity. To get
the value of this function one must follow this recipe:

Indeed, there is no physical diﬀerence between these two states as all experiments yield
the same results (probabilities). For the same reason we will say that two propositions

(4.1)

It follows from the above discussion that the probability measure (φ
x) considered as a
function on the set of all states Φ is a unique representative of proposition x (diﬀerent
propositions have diﬀerent representatives). So, we can gain some insight into the
relationships in the set of all propositions about a physical system (denoted by
) by
studying relationships between corresponding probability measures.

There are propositions which are always true independent on the state of the sys-
tem. For example, the proposition “the value of observable F is somewhere on the real
line” is always true.1 Note that according to (4.1), such propositions about diﬀerent
observables F1 and F2 are actually identical. So, we can deﬁne a unique maximum
proposition I
which is always true. Inversely, the proposition “the value of ob-
servable belongs to the empty set of the real line” is always false and will be called the
minimum proposition. There is just one minimum proposition

Although normally two diﬀerent propositions cannot be measured simultaneously,

x corresponds to the subset X of the real line, then its orthocomplement (denoted

probability measures, so we will call them Assertions rather than Postulates. However,
these two Assertions can be proven if we use the fundamental Assertions of classical
mechanics: Ic and Jc. In particular, the Assertion Jc says that in classical pure states
all measurements of a proposition yield the same results. Then each proposition is
either always true or always false, and the probability measure can have only two

propositions is greatly simpliﬁed by analyzing their truth functions. For example, to
show the equality of two propositions it is suﬃcient to demonstrate that the values of
their truth functions are the same for all states. Given two propositions x and y, there
are at most four possible values for the pair of their truth functions (φ

Our next step is to demonstrate that classical logic provides entire mathematical frame-

Lemma 4.10. In classical logic, the complement x⊥ of a proposition x is a union of all
atoms not contained in x.
Proof: It is suﬃcient to prove that any atom p not contained in x is contained in x⊥. Indeed, for any such atom we
can write

p = p

A sequence xi (i = 1, . . . , n) of lattice elements is called a chain of length n if
xi < xi+1. The rank of a lattice is the length of the longest chain. It is easy to see that
the rank of an atomic Boolean lattice coincides with the number of atoms. Indeed, if
we enumerate all atoms as p1, p2, ..., pn, then we can build the chain of length n as
follows

x2 = p1 ∨

4.2.3 Classical phase space

Now we are fully equipped to treat experimental propositions as well as pure and
mixed states in classical mechanics. Suppose that the physical system under consid-
eration has observables A, B, C, . . . with corresponding spectra SA, SB, SC, ... Ac-
cording to Theorem 4.16, for each atom p we can ﬁnd its corresponding pure state
φp. Due to the Assertion Ic all these observables can be measured simultaneously, and
we can ﬁnd simultaneous values (real numbers) of observables Ap, Bp, Cp, . . . in this
state. We suppose that there is a minimal set of observables
whose val-
ues
uniquely enumerate all pure states and therefore all atoms. The
direct product5 of spectra of these observables S = SX ×

4.3.2

Logic of quantum mechanics

The distributive Assertions K12a and K12b which played such an important role in
establishing the phase space representation of classical mechanics were derived in sub-
section 4.2.1 from classical Assertions Ic and Jc. In quantum mechanics we are not
allowed to use these Assertions and therefore we must abandon the distributive law.
However, in order to get a non-trivial theory we need some substitute for this prop-
erty. This additional postulate should be speciﬁc enough to yield sensible physics and
general enough to be non-empty and to include the distributive law as a particular
case. The latter requirement is justiﬁed by our desire to have classical mechanics as a
particular case of more general quantum mechanics.

To ﬁnd such a generalization we will use the following arguments. From Theorem
4.17 we know that the compatibility of all propositions is a characteristic property
of classical Boolean lattices. We also mentioned that this property translates to the
simultaneous measurability of propositions. We know that in quantum mechanics not
all propositions are simultaneously measurable, therefore they cannot be compatible
as well. This suggests that we may try to ﬁnd a generalization of classical theory by
limiting the set of mutually compatible propositions. In quantum mechanics, we will
postulate that two propositions are deﬁnitely compatible if one implies the other, and
leave it to mathematics to tell us about the compatibility of other pairs.

CHAPTER 4. QUANTUM MECHANICS

Orthocomplemented lattices (those with Postulates K1 - K11 and Postulate L) with
the addition of the Postulate K13 (where Assertions K12 are not necessarily true) are
called orthomodular lattices. We will also assume that the lattice of propositions
is
atomic (Postulate M) and irreducible. Such lattices are called quantum propositional
systems or quantum logics. So, the most fundamental conclusion of our study in this
chapter is that

•

Statement N [quantum logic]: Experimental propositions form a quantum propo-
sitional system.

In principle, it should be possible to perform all constructions and calculations
in quantum theory by using the formalism of orthomodular lattices based on just
described postulates. Such an approach would have certain advantages because all its
components have clear physical meaning: propositions are realizable in laboratories
and probabilities can be directly measured in experiments. However, this approach
meets tremendous diﬃculties mainly because lattices are rather exotic mathematical
objects and we lack intuition when dealing with lattice operations.

We saw that in classical mechanics the happy alternative to lattice theory is pro-
vided by Theorem 4.13 which introduces a simple and physically transparent language
of the phase space. Is there a similar theorem in the quantum case? To answer this
question, we may notice that there is a striking similarity between algebra of projections
in the complex Hilbert space (see Appendix A.5) and propositions in orthomodular lat-
tices discussed above. In particular, if operations between subspaces (projections) in
the Hilbert space are translated to the lattice operations according to Table 4.5, then
all properties K1
K11 and K13 can be directly veriﬁed. For example, the validity
of the Postulate K13 is seen from Lemmas A.16 and A.17. Atoms can be identiﬁed

that only 0 and

.

However the properties K12a and K12b are not valid in the lattice of subspaces.
To show that, it is suﬃcient to demonstrate that some consequences of K12 are not
true. The most apparent is the violation of Lemmas 4.10 - 4.12. For example, Lemma
4.10 asserts that each atom in the lattice belongs either to x or to x⊥ for any x. In
this is not true6 as there are atoms belonging neither to
the lattice of subspaces in
x nor to x⊥ (see Fig. 4.2). So, the lattice is not Boolean and the logic represented by
subspaces in the Hilbert space is not classical.

Thus we established that the set of closed subspaces (or projections) in any complex
Hilbert space
is a representation of some orthomodular atomic irreducible lattice or
quantum logic. The next question is: can we ﬁnd a Hilbert space representation for each
quantum propositional system? The answer to this question is given by the famous
Piron theorem [32] which allows us to claim the isomorphism between the Hilbert space
formalism and the logico-probabilistic approach. (The proof of this theorem is beyond
the scope of this book.)

we will only consider those rings which include R as a subring. In 1877 Frobenius proved that there are
only three such rings. They are real numbers R, complex numbers C, and quaternions Q. Although

Now we can translate important notions of observable and state into the new language
of Hilbert spaces. Having established the isomorphism between propositions and closed
subspaces in the Hilbert space, we will often use these terms interchangeably.

4.3.3 Observables

Each observable F deﬁnes a set of propositions FE=”the value of observable is inside
subset E of the real line”. So, each observable deﬁnes a function FE (called the
proposition-valued measure) from the subsets E of the real line to propositions in
such that

Each point fα in the spectrum of observable F is called eigenvalue (or, sometimes,
corresponding to the eigenvalue fα is called
quantum number ). The subspace Ffα ⊂ H
eigensubspace and a projection Pα onto this subspace is called a spectral projection.
Each vector in the eigensubspace is called eigenvector. Since propositions xα and xβ
= β, the subspaces Ffα and Ffβ are orthogonal. The linear span of all
are disjoint if α
subspaces Ffα is the full Hilbert space. Therefore spectral projections of any observable
form a decomposition of unity. So, according to discussion in subsection A.5.1, we can
associate an Hermitian operator F =

fαPα with each observable.

where PA is the projection onto the subspace A.

The proof of this theorem is far from trivial and we refer interested reader to ref.
[35, 36]. Here we will focus on the physical interpretation of this result. First, we may
notice that, according to the spectral theorem (theorem A.9), the operator ρ can be

Among all states satisfying eq. (4.30) - (4.32) there are simple states for which just
one coeﬃcient ρi is non-zero. Then, from (4.31) it follows that ρi = 1 and the density
operator is just a projection onto the one-dimensional subspace
. Such states
will be called pure quantum states.9 One can notice an important diﬀerence between
classical pure states and quantum pure states. A classical pure state is characterized
by a truth function which can only take values 0 or 1. The value of the probability
measure corresponding to the pure quantum state can be any real number between 0
and 1. Thus, unlike classical pure states, quantum pure states are characterized by
statistical uncertainties.

eiih

ei|

|

Mixed states are expressed as weighed sums of pure states whose coeﬃcients ρi
reﬂect the probabilities with which the pure states enter in the statistical mixture.
Therefore, in quantum mechanics there are uncertainties of two types. The ﬁrst type
is the uncertainty present in mixed states and already familiar from classical physics.
This uncertainty results from our insuﬃcient control of preparation conditions (like
when a bullet is ﬁred from a gun). The second uncertainty is present even in pure
quantum states and is unique to quantum mechanics. It does not have a counterpart in
classical mechanics, and it cannot be avoided by tightening the preparation conditions.

9It is also common to describe the pure state by a unit vector from this subspace (ray). Any vector
from the ray represents the same state, i.e., in the vector representation of states there is a freedom
of choosing an unimodular phase factor of the state vector.

4.3. QUANTUM MECHANICS

4.3.5 Commuting and compatible observables

In subsection 4.3.1 we deﬁned the notion of compatible propositions.
In subsection
A.5.1 we showed that the compatibility of propositions is equivalent to the commu-
tativity of corresponding projections. The importance of these deﬁnitions for physics
comes from the fact that for a pair of compatible propositions there are states in which
both these propositions are certain, i.e., simultaneously measurable. A similar state-
ment can be made for two compatible (commuting) Hermitian operators of observables.
According to theorem A.20 in subsection A.5.1, both observables have deﬁnite values
in states represented by their common eigenvectors.

We can assume that for any physical system there always exists a set of mutually
compatible (commuting) observables F, G, H, . . . and an orthonormal basis
eii
such
eii
that each basis vector is uniquely labeled by eigenvalues of these operators, i.e., if
and
are two eigenvectors then there is at least one diﬀerent eigenvalue in two sets
fi, gi, hi, . . . and fj, gj, hj, . . .. The set F, G, H, . . . is called the complete set of mutually
commuting operators.

position and momentum representation, and learn how the wave function transforms

4.3.7 Basic rules of quantum mechanics

The results obtained in sections 4.2 and 4.3 can be summarized as follows. If we want
to calculate the probability ρ for measuring the value of observable inside interval E of
the real axis for a system prepared in a pure state φ, we need to perform the following
steps:

In classical mechanics:

In section 7.3, we will see that in the macroscopic world with massive objects and poor
resolution of instruments, the classical rules emerge as a decent approximation to the
quantum ones.

QUANTUM MECHANICS AND
RELATIVITY

There must be no barriers for freedom of inquiry.
There is no place for dogma in science. The scientist
is free, and must be free to ask any question,
to doubt any assertion, to seek for any evidence,
to correct any errors.
J. Robert Oppenheimer

As stated in the Preface, the main goal of this book is to build a consistent relativistic
quantum theory. To do that, we need to translate the eﬀects of inertial transformations
of observers and preparation devices into the quantum language of vectors and opera-
tors in the Hilbert space. We will ﬁnd that the uniﬁcation of relativity with quantum
mechanics is achieved by following the Wigner’s prescription: Inertial transformations
of laboratories are represented by rays of unitary transformations Ug in the Hilbert
space of the system. This Hilbert space, therefore, must carry a unitary representation
of the Poincar´e group.

5.1 Inertial transformations

The relativity postulate A tells us that any laboratory L is physically equivalent to any
other laboratory L′ = gL obtained from L by applying an inertial transformation g.1

1Strictly speaking, the characterization of laboratories by parameters of inertial transformations,
as in chapter 2, is not consistent with quantum mechanics. The laboratories are, after all, quantum
objects, and simultaneous exact determination of their positions, velocities, and orientations is not
possible. Frankly, I do not know how to avoid this inconsistency here. The only justiﬁcation is that

CHAPTER 5. QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY

As shown in Fig. 3.4, laboratories are composed of two parts: the preparation device
P and the observer O. The preparation device is responsible for preparing the system
in a certain state φ. The observer has measuring apparatuses which can be described
by propositions X. The result of the experiment (= aggregate of many measurements
performed in the ensemble of identical physical systems prepared in diﬀerent equivalent
laboratories) is given by the probability measure (φ
X). An inertial transformation
of the laboratory results in changes of both the preparation device and observer. We
can formally denote the corresponding change of the state of the system by φ
gφ
and the corresponding change of the experimental propositions by X
gX. Then the
relativity principle demands that the results of experiments are not aﬀected by this
transformation, i.e., for any g, φ, and X

and gX.

5.1.1 Wigner theorem

Let us ﬁrst focus on the inertial transformations of propositions. (We will turn to the
transformations of states in the next subsection.) Suppose that two observers O and
O′ are related by an inertial transformation: O′ = gO. The experimental propositions
attributed to the observer O form a propositional lattice
) which is realized as a
(
H
. Observer O′ also represents her propositions as
set subspaces in the Hilbert space
subspaces in the same Hilbert space
. As these two observers are equivalent, we may
expect that their propositional systems have exactly the same mathematical structures,
i.e., they are isomorphic. This means that there exists a one-to-one mapping

As discussed in subsection 4.3.2, working with propositions is rather inconvenient.
It would be better to translate conditions (5.2) - (5.6) into the language of vectors in
the Hilbert space. This task does not seem too diﬃcult. Indeed, transformations Kg
map subspaces to subspaces, so they can be extended to mappings of vectors to vectors.
Conversely, we will say that a vector transformation kg :
generates a subspace

transformation Kg, if Kg(X) = Y implies that for any
Y
X we have kg|
i ∈

. Given
and for any vector
i
i
generator kg the image Kg(X) of any subspace X can be build as a linear span of
of vectors in X. The problem here is that there are just too many vector
images kg|
transformations which generate any given subspace transformation Kg. For example,
if a ray p goes to the ray Kg(p), then the generator kg must map each vector
p
somewhere inside Kg(p), but the exact value of kg|
remains undetermined. Actually,
for any generator kg we can build an equivalent generator k′g by multiplying each image

In this formulation, the Wigner theorem has been proven in ref. [38] (see also [39]).

From our study of inertial transformations in chapter 2, we know that there is
always a continuous path from the identity transformation e =
to any
other element g. The identity transformation is represented in the Hilbert space by
the identity operator (up to an arbitrary unimodular factor) which is, of course, unitary.
It seems reasonable to demand that the mappings g
kg are continuous,
so, the representative kg cannot suddenly switch from unitary to antiunitary. Then we

can reject the antiunitary transformations as representatives of Kg. The antiunitary
operators may still represent discrete transformations, such as time inversion, but we
agreed not to discuss such transformations in this book, because they do not correspond
to exact symmetries.

Although Wigner theorem reduces the freedom of choosing generators, it does not
eliminate this freedom completely: Two unitary transformations kg and βkg, where β
is any unimodular constant, generate the same subspace mapping. Therefore, for each
Kg there is a set of generating vector transformations diﬀering from each other by a
multiplicative constant. Such set is called a ray of transformations.

Results of this subsection can be summarized as follows: each inertial transforma-
tion g can be represented by a unitary operator operator Ug in

Inertial transformations of states

In the previous subsection we analyzed the eﬀect of an inertial transformation g on
the measuring apparatuses and propositions. Now we are going to discuss the eﬀect of
g on the preparation devices and states. The question is: if
is a vector describing
a pure state prepared by the preparation device P , then which state vector
is
prepared by the transformed preparation device P ′ = gP ?

5.1.3 Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger pictures

In subsections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 we discussed the case when an inertial transformation
g was applied to the laboratory as a whole. What will happen if only observer or
only preparation device are transformed? If we change the observer without changing
the preparation device then operators of observables change according to (5.7) while
. As expected, this transformation changes
the state vector remains the same
the results of experiments. For example, the expectation values of observable F are
generally diﬀerent for diﬀerent observers O and O′

Formulas (5.10) and (5.11) play a prominent role because many problems in physics
can be formulated as questions about the descriptions of the same physical system by
diﬀerent observers. An important example is dynamics, i.e., the time evolution of the
system (g =
is time translation). Then eqs. (5.10) and (5.11) provide two
equivalent descriptions of dynamics: eq. (5.10) describes dynamics in the Heisenberg
picture (state vectors are ﬁxed and operators of observables change with time), while
eq. (5.11) describes dynamics in the Schr¨odinger picture (operators of observables are
time-independent and state vectors depend on time). These two pictures are equivalent
because according to (5.1) a shift of the observer by g is equivalent to the shift of the
preparation device by g−

We also see that the notions of Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg pictures can be generalized
to any type of inertial transformations (space translations, rotations, and boosts).

Kg−1 = K −

Kg3(Kg2Kg1) = (Kg3Kg2)Kg1

(5.12)
(5.13)
(5.14)

which follow from the group properties of inertial transformations g. Our goal in
this section is to ﬁnd out how this group structure is reﬂected in the set of unitary
representatives Ug in the Hilbert space.

5.2.1 Projective representations of groups

Let us choose an arbitrary unitary representative in the ray corresponding to each
group element Ug1 ∈
Kg1, Ug2 ∈
Kg2g1. The product Ug2Ug1 generates
the mapping Kg2g1, therefore it can diﬀer from Ug2g1 by at most a unimodular constant.
So, we can write for any two transformations g1 and g2

Kg2, and Ug2g1 ∈

The factors α have three properties. First, they are unimodular.

Second, from the property (A.2) of the unit element we have for any g

Ug2Ug1 = α(g2, g1)Ug2g1

α(g2, g1)

= 1

UgUe = α(g, e)Ug = Ug
UeUg = α(e, g)Ug = Ug

(5.15)

(5.16)

(5.17)
(5.18)

which implies

α(g, e) = α(e, g) = 1

(5.19)

Third, the associative law (5.14) implies

108

CHAPTER 5. QUANTUM MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY

Ug3(α(g2, g1)Ug2g1) = (α(g3, g2)Ug3g2)Ug1
α(g2, g1)α(g3, g2g1)Ug3g2g1 = α(g3g2, g1)α(g3, g2)Ug3g2g1
α(g2, g1)α(g3, g2g1) = α(g3g2, g1)α(g3, g2)

(5.20)

The mapping Ug from group elements to unitary operators in

is called a projective

group representation if it satisﬁes eqs (5.15), (5.16), (5.19), and (5.20).

Elimination of central charges in the Poincar´e Lie al-
gebra

In principle, we can keep the arbitrary unitary representatives of the subspace transfor-
mations Ug1, Ug2, etc selected above and work with the projective representation of the
Poincar´e group, but this would result in a rather complicated mathematical formalism.
The theory would be signiﬁcantly simpler if we could judiciously choose the represen-
tatives in such a way that the factors α(g2, g1) in (5.15) are eliminated. Then we
would have a much simpler ordinary group representation (see Appendix A.6) instead
of the projective group representation. In this subsection we are going to demonstrate
that in any projective representation of the Poincar´e group such elimination is indeed
possible.3

The conditions (5.16), (5.19), and (5.20) can be also expressed in the Lie algebra
notation. In the vicinity of the group identity element we can use vectors from the
Poincar´e Lie algebra to identify group elements, i.e.

g = e~ζ

called the generators of the unitary

of the Poincar´e Lie algebra in the Hilbert space
. Then we can write eq. (5.15) in
the form

H

U~ζU~ξ = α(~ζ, ~ξ)U~ζ~ξ

Since α is unimodular we can set α(~ζ, ~ξ) = exp iκ(~ζ, ~ξ), where κ(~ζ, ~ξ) is a real function.
The conditions (5.19) and (5.20) then can be rewritten in terms of κ

κ(~ζ,~0) = κ(~0, ~ζ) = 0

κ(~ξ, ~ζ) + κ(~χ, ~ξ~ζ) = κ(~χ~ξ, ~ζ) + κ(~χ, ~ξ)

Note that we can write the lowest order term in the Taylor series of κ near the group
identity element in the form (see also eq. (A.32))

The constant term, the terms linear in ζ a and ξb, as well as the terms proportional
to ζ aζ b and ξaξb are absent on the right hand side of (5.25) as a consequence of the
condition (5.23).

The next step in elimination of central charges E is to use the freedom of choosing
unimodular factors β(g) in front of operators of the representation Ug: Two unitary
operators U~ζ and β(~ζ)U~ζ diﬀering by a unimodular factor β(~ζ) generate the same
subspace transformation. Correspondingly, the choice of generators Fa has some degree
of arbitrariness as well. Since β(~ζ) are unimodular, we can write

β(~ζ) = exp(iγ(~ζ))

1 + i

Raζ a

≈

Xa=1

Therefore, in the ﬁrst order, the presence of factors β(~ζ) results in adding some real
constants Ra to generators Fa. We would like to show that by adding such constants
we can make all central charges equal to zero.

Let us now add constants R to the generators ˜Pj, ˜Jj, and ˜Kj and denote the

redeﬁned generators as

Thus Hermitian operators H, P, J, and K provide a representation of the Poincar´e Lie
algebra and the redeﬁned unitary operators β(g)Ug form an ordinary representation of
the Poincar´e group in the vicinity of the group identity.

Commutators (5.50) - (5.56) are probably the most important equations of rela-
tivistic quantum theory. In the rest of this book we will have many opportunities to
appreciate a deep physical content of these formulas.

5.2.3

Single- and double-valued representations.

In the previous section we eliminated phase factors α(g2, g1) from eq. (5.15) by re-
sorting to Lie algebra arguments. However, these arguments work only in the vicinity
of the identity element of the group. There is a possibility that non-trivial phase fac-
tors may reappear in the multiplication law (5.15) when the group manifold has a
non-trivial topology and group elements are considered which are far from the identity
element.

The simplest example of a group with such a non-trivial topology is the rotation
group G. Note that two rotations around the same axis by angles φ and φ + 2πn (with
integer n) are physically indistinguishable. Then the region of independent rotation
vectors can be described as the interior of the sphere of radius π with opposite points
on the surface of the sphere identiﬁed. This set of points will be referred to as ball
Π (see Fig. 5.1). We will be interested in one-parameter families of group elements
which form continuous curves in the group manifold. Since the opposite points on the
surface of the ball are identiﬁed in our topology, any continuous path which crosses
the surface must reappear on the opposite side of the sphere (see Fig. 5.1(a)).

A topological space is described as being simply connected if every loop can be
continuously deformed to a single point. An example of a simply connected topological
space is the surface of a sphere. However, the manifold Π of the rotation parameters
is not simply connected. The loop shown in Fig. 5.1(a) crosses the sphere once and
can not be shrunk to a single point. However, the loop shown in Fig. 5.1(b) can be
continuously deformed to a point. It appears that for any rotation R there are two
~0
classes8 of paths from the group identity
to R. These two classes consist of paths
}
{
that cross the surface of the sphere Π even and odd number of times, respectively. Two
paths from diﬀerent classes cannot be continuously deformed to each other.

8They are also called the homotopy classes.

and returns to

Just as in the Poincar´e algebra, the central charges can be eliminated in the Lie
algebra of the rotation group by a proper choice of numerical constants added to
generators. Then a unitary representation of the rotation group can be constructed in
which the identity rotation is represented by the identity operator, and by traveling
a small loop in the group manifold which starts from

will end up with the identity operator I again. However, if we travel the long path

may acquire a phase factor eiφ after travel along such a loop. On the other hand,
we obtain a loop which crosses
making two passes on the loop
→
the surface of the sphere twice, and hence can be deformed to a point. Therefore
e2iφ = 1, and eiφ =
1. This demonstrates that there are two types of unitary
representations of the rotation group: single-valued and double-valued. For single-
valued representations, the representative of the identity transformation is always I.
For double-valued representations, the identity transformation has two representatives
I and

I, and the product of two operators in (5.15) may have a non-trivial factor

Since rotation group is a subgroup of the Poincar´e group, the latter also has a non-

double-valued representations of the Poincar´e group.

5.2.4 The fundamental statement of relativistic quantum the-

ory.

The most important result of this chapter is the connection between relativity and
quantum mechanics summarized in the following (see, e.g., [41])

Statement O [Unitary representations of the Poincar´e group]:

•

In a relativistic quantum description of a physical system, inertial transforma-
tions are represented by unitary operators which furnish a unitary (single- or
double-valued) representation of the Poincar´e group in the Hilbert space of the
system.

Elementary inertial transformations are represented in the Hilbert space by unitary op-

In chapters 4 and 5 we established that any physical system is described by a complex
, observables are represented
Hilbert space
by Hermitian operators in
, and there is a unitary representation of the Poincar´e
group in
which determines how state vectors and operators of observables change
from one observer to another. Our next goal is to clarify the structure of the set
of observables. In particular, we wish to ﬁnd which operators correspond to familiar
observables, such as velocity, momentum, energy, mass, position, etc, what are their
spectra, and what are the relationships between these operators?

H

H

In this chapter we will focus on observables whose operators can be expressed as
functions of generators (P, J, K, H) of the Poincar´e group representation and derive
the explicit form of these functions here. In chapter 9, we will meet other observables,
such as charge and the number of particles. They cannot be expressed through ten
generators of the Poincar´e group.

6.1 Basic observables

6.1.1 Energy, momentum, and angular momentum

The generators of the Poincar´e group representation H, P, J, and K in the Hilbert
space of any system are Hermitian operators, and we might suspect that they are
related to certain observables. What are these observables? In order to get a hint,

119

120

CHAPTER 6. OPERATORS OF OBSERVABLES

let us now postulate that the constant ¯h introduced in subsection 5.2.2 is the Planck
m2
s whose dimensionality can be also expressed as < ¯h >=
constant ¯h = 6.626
·
(mass)(velocity)(distance). Then the dimensionality of the generators is found from
the condition that the arguments of the exponents in (5.57) must be dimensionless

< H >= <¯h>

(time) = (mass)(velocity)2;

< P >= <¯h>

(distance) = (mass)(velocity);

< J >=< ¯h >= (mass)(velocity)(distance)

< K >= <¯h>

(velocity) = (mass)(distance);

•

•

•

•

Based on the dimensionality we can guess that these are observables of energy (or
Hamiltonian) H, momentum P, and angular momentum J of the system.1 We will
call them basic observables. Operators H, P, and J generate transformations of the
system as a whole, so we will assume that these are observables for the entire system,
i.e., total energy, total momentum, and total angular momentum. Of course, these
dimensionality considerations are not a proof. The justiﬁcation of these choices will
become clear later, when we consider properties of operators and relations between
them.

Using this interpretation and commutators in the Poincar´e Lie algebra (5.50) -
(5.56), we immediately obtain commutation relations between operators of observ-
ables. Then we know which pairs of observables can be simultaneously measured.
For example, we see from (5.53) that the energy is simultaneously measurable with
the momentum and angular momentum, however, diﬀerent components of the angular
momentum cannot be measured simultaneously. These facts are well-known from the
non-relativistic quantum mechanics.

From commutators (5.50) - (5.56) we can also ﬁnd the formulas for the transfor-
mations of operators H, P, J, and K from one inertial frame to another. For example,
each vector observable F = P, J or K transforms under rotations as (see eq. (A.22))

K is related to the observable of position.

6.2 Casimir operators

The observables H, P, V and J depend on the observer, so they do not represent in-
trinsic fundamental properties of the system. For example, if a system has momentum
p in one frame of reference, then there are other (moving) frames of reference in which
the momentum takes any other value from R3. The momentum of the system depends
on both the state of the system and the reference frame in which the observation is
made. Are there observables which reﬂect some intrinsic observer-independent proper-
ties of the system? If there are such observables, their operators must commute with all
generators of the Poincar´e group. They are called Casimir operators. It can be shown
that the Poincar´e group has only two independent Casimir operators [43]. Any other
Casimir operator of the Poincar´e group is a function of these two. So, there should
be two invariant physical properties of any freely moving system. One such property
is mass, which is a measure of the matter content in the system. The corresponding
Casimir operator will be considered in subsection 6.2.1. Another invariant property
is related to the speed of rotation of the system around its own axis or spin.3 The
Casimir operator corresponding to this invariant property will be found in subsection
6.3.2.

Before addressing the Casimir operators, let us introduce some useful deﬁnitions.

Then, it is easy to show that the 4-square A2

Therefore, in order to ﬁnd the Casimir operators of the Poincar´e group we should be
looking for two independent 4-vectors which, in addition, commute with H and P.

3From classical mechanics we know that the total angular momentum of a body is a sum of two
parts. The ﬁrst part is the angular momentum resulting from the linear movement of the body as a
whole with respect to the observer. The second part is related to the rotation of the body around
its own axis, or spin. The invariance of the absolute value of spin is evident for macroscopic freely
moving objects. Indeed, no matter how we translate, rotate or boost the frame of reference we cannot
stop the spinning motion of the system or force it to spin in the opposite direction.

124

CHAPTER 6. OPERATORS OF OBSERVABLES

6.2.1 Operator of mass

We already have one such 4-vector composed of operators H and cP and usually called
c2P2 obviously commutes with H
the energy-momentum 4-vector. Its 4-square H 2
and P. Then we can construct the invariant mass operator as

−

M = +

√H 2

P 2c2

−

1
c2

(6.7)

P 2c2

The operator of mass must be Hermitian, therefore we demand that for any physical
system H 2
P 2c2 does not
contain negative values. Honoring the fact that masses of all known physical systems
are non-negative we choose the positive value of the square root in (6.7). Then the
relationship between the energy, momentum, and mass takes the form

0. This means that the spectrum of operator H 2

≥

H = +√P2c2 + M 2c4

In the non-relativistic limit (c

) we obtain from eq. (6.8)

which is the sum of the famous Einstein’s rest mass energy E = Mc2 and the usual

so W 0 is a scalar. Moreover, W 0 changes its sign after changing the sign of P so it is a
pseudoscalar. W is a pseudovector, because it does not change the sign after changing
signs of K and P and

Now we are ready to tackle the problem of ﬁnding expressions for spin and position as
functions of generators of the Poincar´e group [44, 45, 46, 47].

6.3.1 Physical requirements

We will be looking for the total spin operator S and the center-of-mass position operator
R which have the following natural properties.

(I) Owing to the similarity between spin and angular momentum (see footnote on

page 123), we demand that S is a pseudovector (just like J)

(II) and that components of S satisfy the same commutation relations as components

of J

[Si, Sj] = i¯h

ǫijkSk

(6.19)

(III) We also demand that spin can be measured simultaneously with momentum

[Jj, Si] = i¯h

ǫijkSk;

3

Xk=1

Xk=1

[P, S] = 0;

(IV) and with position

[R, S] = 0

(6.20)

(V) From the physical meaning of R it follows that translations simply shift the

values of position.

So far we guessed the form of the spin operator and veriﬁed that the required properties
are satisﬁed.6 In subsection 6.3.6 we will demonstrate that S is the unique operator
satisfying all conditions from subsection 6.3.1.

6.3.3 Position operator

Now we are going to switch to the derivation of the position operator. Here we will
follow a similar route: we will ﬁrst guess the form of the operator R and then (in
subsection 6.3.7) prove that this is the unique expression satisfying all requirements
from subsection 6.3.1. Our guess for R is the Newton-Wigner position operator 7 [45]

6.3.4 Alternative set of basic operators

So far, our plan was to construct operators of observables from 10 basic generators
(P, J, K, H). However, this set of operators is often diﬃcult to use in calculations
due to rather complicated commutation relations in the Poincar´e Lie algebra (5.50)
- (5.56). For systems with a strictly positive spectrum of the mass operator, it is
sometimes more convenient to use an alternative set of basic operators (P, R, S, M)
whose commutation relations are much simpler

[P, M] = [R, M] = [S, M] = [Ri, Rj] = [Pi, Pj] = 0

(6.33)

[Ri, Pj] = i¯hδij

[P, S] = [R, S] = 0

6.3.5 Canonical form and power of operators

In this subsection, we would like to mention some mathematical facts which will
be helpful in further calculations. When performing calculations with functions of
Poincar´e generators, we meet a problem that the same operator can be expressed
in many equivalent functional forms. For example, according to (5.56) KxH and

6.3. OPERATORS OF SPIN AND POSITION.

137

i¯hPx are two forms of the same operator. To solve the problem of the non-
HKx −
uniqueness, we will agree to write operator factors always in the canonical form, i.e.,
from left to right in the following order10:

C(Px, Py, Pz, H), Jx, Jy, Jz, Kx, Ky, Kz

(6.41)

Consider, for example, the operator KyPyJx. This operator is not in the canonical
form. To bring it to the canonical form, ﬁrst we need to move the momentum factor
to the left. Using (5.55) we obtain

KyPyJx = PyKyJx + [KyPy]Jx

= PyKyJx −

i¯h
c2 HJx

(6.42)

The second term in eq. (6.42) is already in the canonical form, but the ﬁrst term is
not. We need to switch factors Jx and Ky there. Then

KyPyJx = PyJxKy + Py[Ky, Jx]

= PyJxKy −

i¯hPyKz −

(6.43)

i¯h
c2 HJx

−
i¯h
c2 HJx

Now all terms in (6.43) are in the canonical form.

The procedure for bringing operator to the canonical form in the general case is
not more diﬃcult than in the above example. If we call the original operator primary
term, then this procedure can be formalized in the following sequence of steps: First we
transform the primary term to the canonical form. We do that by switching the order
of pairs of neighboring factors if they occur in the “wrong” order. Let us call them
“left factor” L and “right factor” R. If R happens to commute with L, then such a
change has no other eﬀect. If R does not commute with L, then the result of the switch
is LR
RL + [L, R]. This means that apart from switching we must add another
secondary term to the original expression which is obtained from the primary term by
replacing the product LR with the commutator [L, R]. (The second and third terms on
the right hand side of (6.43) are secondary.) At the end of step 1. we have all factors
in the primary term in the canonical order.
If during this process all commutators
[L, R] were zero, then we are done. If there were nonzero commutators, then we have
a number of additional secondary terms. Generally, these terms are not yet in the

→

10Since H, Px, Py, and Pz commute with each other, the part of the operator depending on these

factors can be written as an ordinary function of commuting arguments C(Px, Py, Pz, H).

138

CHAPTER 6. OPERATORS OF OBSERVABLES

canonical form, and the above procedure should be repeated for them resulting in
tertiary, etc. terms until all terms are in the canonical order.

Then, for each operator there is a unique representation as a sum of terms in the

canonical form

where C αβ = C αβ(Px, Py, Pz, H) are functions of translation generators.

We will also ﬁnd useful the notion of a power of the term A (we write pow(A)),
which is deﬁned as the number of factors J and K in the term. For example, the ﬁrst
term on the right hand side of (6.44) has power 0. The second and third terms have
power 1, etc. The power of a general operator which is a sum of several terms is deﬁned
as the maximum power among terms in A. For the operators considered earlier in this
chapter, we have

pow[H] = pow[P] = pow[V] = 0
pow[W 0] = pow[W] = pow[S] = pow[R] = 1

Lemma 6.2 : If L and R are operators from the list (6.41) and [L, R]

= 0, then

pow([L, R]) = pow(L) + pow(R)

1

−

Proof: The commutator [L, R] is non-zero in two cases.

1. pow(L) = 1 and pow(R) = 0 (or, equivalently, pow(L) = 0 and pow(R) = 1). From commutation relations
(5.50), (5.53), (5.55), and (5.56), it follows that non-vanishing commutators between Lorentz generators and translation
generators are functions of translation generators, i.e., have zero power. The same is true for commutators between
Lorentz generators and arbitrary functions of translation generators C(Px, Py, Pz, H).

2. If pow(L) = 1 and pow(R) = 1, then pow([L, R]) = 1 follows directly from commutators (5.51), (5.52), and

(5.54).

The primary term for the product AB has exactly the same number of Lorentz

generators as the original operator, i.e., pow(A) + pow(B).

Lemma 6.3 For two terms A and B, either secondary term in the product AB is zero
or its power is equal to pow(A) + pow(B) -1.
Proof: Each secondary term results from substituting a product of two generators LR in the primary term by their
commutator [L, R]. According to Lemma 6.2, if [L, R]

= 0 such substitution decreases the power of the term by 1.

The powers of the tertiary and higher order terms are less than the power of the
secondary terms. Therefore, for any product AB

pow(AB) = pow(BA) = pow(A) + pow(B)

This implies

Having at our disposal basic operators P, R, S, and M we can form a number of

6.3.6 Uniqueness of the spin operator

Let us now prove that (6.23) is the unique spin operator satisfying conditions (I) - (IV).
Suppose that there is another spin operator S′ satisfying these conditions. Denoting
the power of the spin components by p = pow(S′x) = pow(S′y) = pow(S′z) we obtain
from (6.19) and Theorem 6.4

pow([S′x, S′y]) = pow(S′z)

Therefore, the components of S′ must have power 1. The most general form of a
pseudovector operator having power 1 can be deduced from Table 6.1

6.3.7 Uniqueness of the position operator

Assume that in addition to the Newton-Wigner position operator R there is another
position operator R′ satisfying all properties (IV) - (VI). Then it follows from the
condition (V) that R′ has power 1. The most general true vector with this property is

of the position operator is

R′ = R + g(P 2, M)P

(6.45)

In subsection 7.3.7, we will consider the boost transformations of the position, and
show that to be consistent with Lorentz transformations for free particles (1.6) - (1.9)
we must set g(P 2, M) = 0. So, from now on, we will use the Newton-Wigner operator
R as the representative of the position observable.

Physics is becoming so unbelievably complex that it is
taking longer and longer to train a physicist. It is
taking so long, in fact, to train a physicist to the place
where he understands the nature of physical problems
that he is already too old to solve them.
Eugene P. Wigner

The discussion in the previous chapter could be universally applied to an arbitrary
isolated physical system, be it an electron or the Solar System. We have not speciﬁed
how the system was put together and we considered only total observables pertinent
to the system as a whole. The results we obtained are not surprising: the total energy,
momentum and angular momentum of any isolated system are conserved, and the cen-
ter of mass is moving with a constant velocity along straight line (6.47). Although the
time evolution of these total observables is rather uneventful, the internal structure of
complex (compound) physical systems may undergo dramatic changes due to collisions,
reactions, decays, etc. The description of such transformations is the most interesting
and challenging part of physics. To address such problems, we need to deﬁne how
complex physical systems are put together. The central idea of this book is that all
material objects are composed of elementary particles i.e., systems without compo-
nents and internal structure.1 In this chapter we will study these most fundamental
ingredients of nature.

We established in subsection 5.2.4 that any physical system is described by a uni-
tary representation of the Poincare group. We found in Appendix A.6 that any rep-
resentation of the Poincar´e group can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible

1This is in contrast to widely accepted views that primary building blocks of nature are (quantum)

ﬁelds.

representations. Elementary particles are deﬁned as physical systems for which this
a of states of a stable elementary
sum has only one summand. The Hilbert space
particle a carries an irreducible unitary representation of the Poincar´e group. The clas-
siﬁcation of irreducible representations of the Poincar´e group and their Hilbert spaces
was given by Wigner [48]. From Shur’s ﬁrst Lemma (see Appendix A.6) we know that
in any irreducible unitary representation of the Poincar´e group, two Casimir operators
M and S2 act as multiplication by a constant. So, all diﬀerent irreducible representa-
tions, and, therefore, all elementary particles, can be classiﬁed according to the values
of these two constants. Of course, there are many more parameters describing elemen-
tary particles, such as charge, magnetic moment, strangeness, etc. But all of them are
related to the manner in which particle participates in interactions. In the world where
all interactions are “turned oﬀ”, particles have just two intrinsic properties: mass and
spin.

There are only six known stable elementary particles for which the classiﬁcation by
mass and spin applies (see Table 7.1). Some reservations should be made about this
statement. First, for each particle in Table 7.1 (except photons) there is a correspond-
ing antiparticle having the same mass and spin but opposite values of the electric charge
and baryon and lepton numbers (see subsection 9.2.1). So, if we also count antipar-
ticles, there are eleven diﬀerent stable particle species. Second, there are many more
particles, like muons, pions, neutrons, etc., which are usually called elementary but all
of them are unstable and eventually decay into particles shown in Table 7.1. This does
not mean that unstable particles are “made of” stable particles or that they are less
elementary. Simply, stable particles from Table 7.1 have the lowest mass, and there
are no lighter species to which they could decay without violating conservation laws.
Third, we do not list in Table 7.1 quarks, gluons, Higgs scalars, and other particles
predicted theoretically, but never observed in experiment.

Fourth, strictly speaking, the photon is not a true elementary particle as it is not
described by an irreducible representation of the Poincar´e group. In fact, as discussed
in subsection 7.4.3, a photon is described by a reducible representation of the Poincar´e
group which is a direct sum of two irreducible representations with helicities +1 and

7.1. MASSIVE PARTICLES

-1. Fifth, neutrinos are not truly stable elementary particles. According to recent
experiments, three ﬂavors of neutrinos are perpetually oscillating between each other
over time. Finally, it may be true that protons are not elementary particles as well.
They are usually regarded as composed of quarks. This leaves us with just one strictly
stable and elementary particle, which is the electron.

In the following we will denote m the value of the mass operator in the Hilbert space
of elementary particle and consider separately two cases: massive particles (m > 0)
and massless particles (m = 0).

7.1 Massive particles

H

The Hilbert space
of a massive elementary particle carries an unitary irreducible
representation Ug of the Poincar´e group characterized by a single positive eigenvalue
m of the mass operator M. As discussed in subsection 6.3.3, the position operator R
is well-deﬁned in this case. The components of the position and momentum operators
satisfy the commutation relations of the 6-dimensional Heisenberg algebra.

Then, according to the Stone-von Neumann theorem (see subsection A.6.2), operators

erators Px, Py, Pz, and the Hilbert space

We will show later that the representation of the Poincar´e group is irreducible if
and only if the representation Vg of the rotation group in
0 is irreducible. So, we will
be interested only in such irreducible representations Vg. As discussed in subsection
A.6.3, the classiﬁcation of unitary irreducible representations of the rotation group
(single- and double-valued) depends on one integer or half-integer parameter s, which
we will call the spin of the particle. The trivial one-dimensional representation is
characterized by spin zero (s = 0) and corresponds to a spinless particle. The two-
dimensional representation corresponds to particles with spin one-half (s = 1/2). The
3-dimensional representation corresponds to particles with spin one (s = 1), etc.

4Note that eigenvectors of the spin operator S (6.23) were obtained by applying pure boosts to
vectors at p = 0. Diﬀerent transformations (involving rotations) connecting bases in points 0 and p
would result in diﬀerent momentum-spin basis and in diﬀerent spin operator S′ (see [49]). Does this
contradict our statement about the uniqueness of the spin operator in subsection 6.3.6? Not really.
The point is that the alternative spin operator S′ (and corresponding alternative position operator
R′) will not be expressed as a function of basic generators of the Poincare group. This condition was
important for our proof of uniqueness of S (and R) in section 6.3.

5Since these transformations are applied to states rather than to observables, you can guess that

we are working in the Schr¨odinger picture here.

would be irreducible with respect to the entire Poincar´e group. Therefore, in order to
construct an irreducible representation of the Poincar´e group in
, the representation
Ds must be an irreducible unitary representation of the rotation group. In this book
we will be interested in describing interactions between electrons and protons which are
massive particles with spin 1/2. Then the relevant representation Ds of the rotation
group is the 2-dimensional representation described in subsection A.6.3.

H

Let us now review the above construction of the unitary irreducible representation
of the Poincar´e group for massive particle.6 There, we ﬁrst chose a standard momentum
vector p = 0 and found a little group (it was the rotation group) which was a subgroup
of the Lorentz group leaving this vector invariant.7 Then we found that the subspace
0 corresponding to the standard vector must carry an irreducible representation of
H
the little group. Then, the entire Hilbert space is guaranteed to carry an irreducible
representation of the Poincar´e group. Translations are represented by multiplication
(7.4)-(7.5), rotations and boosts are represented by formulas (7.6) and (7.11), respec-
tively. It can be shown that the resulting representation of the Poincar´e group does
not depend on the choice of the standard vector in the spectrum of momentum.

6This construction is known as the induced representation method [51].
7Of course, this vector is also invariant with respect to translations.

7.2 Momentum and position representations.

So far we discussed the action of the inertial transformations on basis vectors with
deﬁnite momentum and z-component of spin. All other vectors in the Hilbert space
can be represented as linear combinations of these basis vectors, i.e., they can
H
be represented as wave functions ψ(p, σ) in the momentum-spin representation. For
simplicity, in this section we will consider only massive spinless particles. Our goal
here is to study momentum-space wave functions of such particles and their inertial
transformations.

iKxθψ(r) is non-zero for all values of r if θ

We are not going to explicitly calculate this integral, but one property of the function
(7.30) must be clear: the non-analyticity of the square roots in the integrand implies
that e−
= 0 (see, e.g. ref. [52]). Therefore,
the moving observer O′ would not agree with O that the particle is localized. Observer
O′ can ﬁnd the particle anywhere in space (although the maximum of the probability
distribution is still near the point r = 0). This means that the notion of localization is
relative: a state localized for one observer (this probability distribution is shown by a
full line in fog. 3(a)) does not look as localized for others (the probability distribution
for the moving observer is shown by a full line in ﬁg. 7.3(b)).

7.3.2

Spreading of well-localized states

Now, let us ﬁnd the appearance of the localized state (7.28) from the point of view of
the observer shifted in time. Again, we ﬁrst make a detour to the momentum space

This integral can be expressed in the closed form [53] (it is shown schematically by the

where K2(z) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the 2nd kind. Although the probability
2 outside the light cone is very small,11 there is a chance that the particle
density
propagates from the origin (let us call it point A, see Fig. 7.3(a)) to point B faster than
the speed of light. This result is well-known in relativistic quantum theory [55]. It is
usually regarded as a sign of a serious trouble, because, as discussed in subsection 1.2.1,
superluminal propagation of particles is forbidden in special relativity. Apparently, we
have a paradox here. However, this paradox is easily resolved if we take into account
the probabilistic character of quantum phenomena.

In classical mechanics it is true that if particle prepared at A arrives in B earlier
than after time RAB/c, then there is a fast-moving observer O′ in which the time order
of the events is reversed, and the signal propagates from B to A in violation of the
causality law. However, the situation is diﬀerent for quantum objects. As discussed
in subsection 7.3.1, the moving observer O′ does not recognize the particle as being
sharply localized neither at time t′ = 0 nor at any other time. For the moving observer,
there is always a non-zero probability to ﬁnd the particle at both points A and B at
each time instant (see Fig. 7.3(b)). Therefore, this observer cannot deﬁnitely say
that the particle moves from B to A, there is no violation of causality in the moving
reference frame, and the ”paradox” is resolved.

11Ruijsenaars estimated the probability of detecting a superluminal electron at

In chapter 4 we have indicated that distributive (classical) lattices are particular cases
of orthomodular (quantum) lattices. Therefore, we may expect that quantum mechan-
ics includes classical mechanics as a particular case. However, this is not obvious how
exactly the phase space of classical mechanics is “embedded” in the Hilbert space of
quantum mechanics. We expect that there must exist a close link between these two
approaches, and we would like to discuss this link in three next subsections. We will
use as an example a single spinless particle with non-zero mass m > 0.

In the macroscopic world we do not meet the localized states like (7.28). Accord-
ing to eq. (7.29), such states have inﬁnite uncertainty of momentum which is rather
unusual. Similarly, we do not meet states with sharply deﬁned momentum, and de-
localized over large space region (7.25). The reason why we do not see such states
is not well understood yet. The most plausible hypothesis is that eigenstates of the
position or eigenstates of the momentum are susceptible to small perturbations (e.g.,
due to temperature or radiation) and rapidly transform to more robust wave packets or
quasiclassical states in which both position and momentum have good, but not perfect
localization.

So, when discussing the classical limit of quantum mechanics, we will consider
quasiclassical states
. These states are assumed to be well-localized around the
point r0 in the position space and well-localized around the point p0 in the momentum
space. Quite generally, such states can be described by the position-space wave function

Ψr0,p0i

|

ψr0,p0(r) =

Ψr0,p0i
where ηr0(r) is a smooth (non-oscillating) function sharply localized around the value
of position r0. For example, we can take

168

CHAPTER 7.

SINGLE PARTICLES

A simple estimate demonstrates that for macroscopic objects the spreading of the
wave packets can be safely neglected. For example, for a particle of mass m = 1 mg and
initial uncertainty of position of d = 1 micron, the time needed for the wave function
to spread to 1 cm is more than 1011 years. Therefore, for quasiclassical states, the
positions and momenta are well deﬁned at all times, the localization is preserved over
a long time interval, and macroscopic particles have well-deﬁned trajectories.

7.3.5 Classical observables and the Poisson bracket.

Besides the large masses of involved objects and relatively good localization in both
position and momentum spaces, there is another feature distinguishing classical world
from the quantum one. This is the poor resolution of classical measurements (the error
is much greater than the quantum of action ¯h). For example, in the classical world we
may not be able to distinguish two quasiclassical states (7.31) with the same values
of r0 and p0 but having diﬀerent shapes of the function ηr0(r). From the classical
point of view, all such states are eigenstates of both position and momentum operators
simultaneously:

Ψr0,p0i

(7.34)
(7.35)

so they can be represented as points (r0, p0) in the phase space. We saw in subsection
6.3.4 that all observables for a massive spinless particle can be expressed as functions
f (P, R) of momentum and position operators. Then it follows from (7.34) and (7.35)
that quasiclassical states are also eigenstates of any such observable

f (R, P)

Ψr0,p0i ≈

|

f (r0, p0)

Ψr0,p0i

So, in the classical limit, observables can represented as functions on the 6D phase
space with coordinates p and r. The expectation value of observable f (R, P) in the
quasiclassical state

is just the value of the corresponding function f (r0, p0)

The above discussion indicates that in the classical world, the Plank constant ¯h should
be eﬀectively set to zero. According to (5.50) - (5.56), all commutators are proportional
to ¯h, so in the classical limit ¯h
0 all operators of observables commute with each
other. The important role played by the commutator in quantum mechanics is that it
allows us to transform observables from one reference frame to another, as in the case
of time translations (5.61). However, the zero classical limit of commutators does not
mean that in the limit ¯h
0 the time evolution stops. Note that the right hand side
of the formula (5.61) does not vanish even in the classical limit ¯h
0, because the
commutators enter multiplied by

For quantum mechanical operators f (R, P) and g(R, P), calculation of the commuta-
tor [f (R, P), g(R, P)] is often a laborious task. However, the calculation of the limit
[f, g]P is greatly simpliﬁed (reduced to calculations of derivatives) by the following
theorem

Theorem 7.1 : If f (R, P) and g(R, P) are two classical observables of a massive spinless
particle, then

[f (R, P), g(R, P)]P =

(7.38)

First, each function can be represented by its Taylor expansion around the origin (r = 0, p = 0) in the phase space,
e.g.,

f (R, P ) = C00 + C10R + C01P + C11RP + C20R2 + C02P 2 + C21R2P + C12RP 2 + . . .

where we agreed to write factors R to the left from factors P . Then it is suﬃcient to prove formula (7.38) for f and g
being monoms of the form RnP m.

i.e., the same result as if eq. (7.38) were used. In a similar fashion we can prove that brackets [RnP m, RqP s+1]P ,
[Rn+1P m, RqP s]P , etc. also satisfy (7.38). Finally, by induction, eq. (7.38) holds for all values of n, m, q, and s.

So, in classical mechanics we just need to know the Poisson brackets of classical ob-
servables (ordinary functions on the phase space) in order to ﬁnd transformations of
observables between diﬀerent reference frames. For example, for the time evolution
we can use formulas (7.36) and (7.37), and in the case when F is either position or

7.3.6 Trajectory in a moving frame of reference

In subsection 7.3.1 we found that if a localized state of a particle is prepared in one
reference frame, it is no longer localized in moving reference frames. Moreover, particles
lose their localization with time, due to the spreading eﬀect. This means that in
quantum mechanics we cannot unambiguously deﬁne the space and time coordinates of
events (such as intersections of particle trajectories). Then the Lorentz transformations
(2.43) - (2.46) between time and space coordinates of events also lose their exact
meaning. However, particle trajectories and Lorentz transformations still have well-
deﬁned meaning in the classical limit of quantum mechanics. These are the subjects
of our discussions in this subsection and the next one.

As discussed in subsection 7.3.5, in the classical limit, all observables commute
with each other and we can replace the operators of observables by functions R, P,
H, etc. on the phase space. We can also replace the anticommutators 1/2
A, B
}
i
by the products AB, and commutators
¯h [A, B] by the Poisson brackets [A, B]P . In
particular, for the position observable of a spinless massive particle, instead of (6.26),
we can write

Lorentz transformations for free particles.

Transformations (7.45) - (7.47) do not resemble manifestly covariant linear Lorentz
transformations (2.43) - (2.46). The three components of position and time do not form
a 4-vector. This is not possible in quantum mechanics, where position is represented
as an Hermitian operator and time is just a numerical parameter. Time is not an
observable in the sense of our deﬁnition in subsection 3.2.1: it is just a numerical label
attached to each measurement according to the reading of the clock at the instant
of the measurement. Clock readings do not depend on the kind of the system being
measured and on the state of the measured system. We can record time even if we
do not measure anything, even if there is no physical system to observe. There is no
“operator of time” such that t is the expectation value of this operator. All attempts
to introduce time operator in quantum mechanics were fruitless.

Nevertheless, we can check that the transformation laws (7.45) - (7.47) agree with
Lorentz transformations for time and position (2.43) - (2.46). For simplicity, we will
only consider particles whose movement is conﬁned to the x-axis: Ry = Rz = Vy =
Vz = 0, and the boost vector ~θ = (θ, 0, 0) is also directed along the x-axis. Then,

7.3. CLASSICAL LIMIT OF QUANTUM MECHANICS.

according to (7.46) and (7.47) Ry(θ, t′) = Rz(θ, t′) = 0, so we can neglect y- and
z-coordinates in our discussion. A trajectory can be viewed as a sequence of events
localized in space and time. So, the transformed trajectory (7.45) would be consistent
with Lorentz transformations if the same sequence will be obtained from the original
trajectory (7.41) by applying eq. (2.43), i.e.,

Therefore, the transformations (7.45) - (7.47) obtained from the commutation relations
of operators are consistent with the Lorentz transformations (2.43) - (2.46).14 There-
fore, the time and the position of events deﬁned as intersections of such trajectories
also transform according to the Lorentz rules. So, as long as we are concerned with ex-
pectation values of positions of non-interacting particles, we are in a formal agreement

7.4 Massless particles

7.4.1 The spectra of momentum, energy, and velocity

In the case of massless particles (m = 0), the method used in section 7.1 does not
work. For massless particles the position operator (6.27) cannot be deﬁned. Therefore
we cannot apply the Stone-von Neumann theorem to ﬁgure out the spectrum of the
operator P. To ﬁnd the spectrum of P we use another argument.

Let us choose a state of the massless particle with arbitrary nonzero momentum
p. If we want to reduce the length of the vector p without aﬀecting its direction we
should use a boost vector ~θ antilinear with p, i.e., ~θ
. Then, using formula (6.2)
and equality ωp = cp we can write

so the result of boost reaches zero only in the limit θ
. This means that the point
p = 0 does not belong to the momentum spectrum of the massless particle15. Then,
from the energy-momentum relationship (6.8) we see that for massless particles the
with the point p = 0 deleted (see
mass hyperboloid degenerates to a cone H = c
Fig. 7.2). Therefore, the spectrum of the velocity observable V = Pc2
H is the surface of
= c. This means that massless particles can move only with the speed
the sphere
of light in any reference frame. The absolute value of their speed does not depend on
the speed of the observer or the source (Statement B).

Strictly speaking, in quantum mechanics, the speed of propagation of photons is not
a well-deﬁned concept. The value of photon’s velocity is deﬁnitely c in states having
certain momentum. However, such states are described by inﬁnitely extended plane
waves, and one cannot speak about propagation of such states. It is clear from eq.
(7.33) that the speed of the spreading of wave packets is inversely proportional to the
mass of the particle. Therefore we may expect that this eﬀect should be especially no-
ticeable for photons. We can obtain the analog of formula (7.33) for massless particles
by formally changing m to E/c2 = ¯hω/c2, where E is the photon energy, and ω = 2πν
is the angular frequency of light. Then, the estimate for the velocity of spreading is
(ignoring numerical factors which are not relevant for our order-of-magnitude estimate)

15The physical meaning of this result is clear because there are no photons with zero momentum

and energy.

size of the aperture, eq. (7.57) is recognized as the formula for the angle of the ﬁrst
diﬀraction peak known from wave optics. Thus, the diﬀraction eﬀect (see discussion in
section 3.1) is explained in quantum mechanics by the phenomenon of the wave packet
spreading. It appears that Grimaldi was the ﬁrst person who observed this quantum
eﬀects two and a half centuries before the idea of quantum.

7.4.2 Representations of the little group

To construct unitary irreducible representations of the Poincar´e group for massless
particles we can slightly modify the method used for massive particles in section 7.1.
As for massless particles the vector p = 0 is not available, let us choose another

standard vector

k = (0, 0, 1)

(7.58)

Next we need to ﬁnd the transformations of the little group which leave this vector
invariant. The energy-momentum 4-vector corresponding to the standard vector (7.58)

having a “continuous spin”. Such particles have not been observed in nature, so we
will not discuss such possibility further. The only case having relevance to physics is the

The allowed values of the parameter τ can be obtained from the fact that the rep-
resentation must be single- or double-valued (see subsection 5.2.3). Therefore, the
rotation by the angle φ = 2π can be represented by either 1 or -1, and τ must be either
integer or half-integer number: τ = . . . ,
1/2, 0, 1/2, 1, . . .. We will refer to the
−
parameter τ as to helicity. This parameter distinguishes diﬀerent unitary irreducible
representations of the Poincar´e group corresponding to massless particles.

this vector to all values of momentum using transformations from the Lorentz group.
So, we need to deﬁne a Lorentz transformation λp which connects the standard mo-

The product of Lorentz transformations in the second factor brings vector k back to

around the z-axis is called the Wigner angle φW (p, Λ).17 Thus, we can ﬁnally write

INTERACTION

I myself, a professional mathematician, on re-reading
my own work ﬁnd it strains my mental powers to recall
to mind from the ﬁgures the meanings of the
demonstrations, meanings which I myself originally put
into the ﬁgures and the text from my mind.
But when I attempt to remedy the obscurity of the
material by putting in extra words, I see myself falling
into the opposite fault of becoming chatty in
something mathematical.
Johannes Kepler

In the previous chapter we discussed isolated elementary particles moving freely in
space. Starting from this chapter we will focus on compound systems consisting of two
or more particles. In addition we will allow a redistribution of energy and momentum
between diﬀerent parts of the system, in other word interactions. In this chapter, we
will limit our discussion to the cases in which creation and/or destruction of particles
is not allowed, and we will consider only few massive spinless particles. Starting from
chapter 9 we will lift these limitations.

8.1 Hilbert space of a many-particle system

In this section we will construct the Hilbert space of a compound system. It is normally
accepted that this space should be built as a tensor product of Hilbert spaces of the
components. However, it is not well known that this statement can be proven from
postulates of quantum loﬁc (e.g., those in chapter 4).

Let us ﬁrst build the Hilbert space of a two-particle system. Let
be
propositional systems of particles 1, 2, and the compound system 1+2, respectively.
Each proposition about subsystem 1 (or 2) is still valid in the combined system, so, it
should be represented also as a proposition in

that all propositions a1 about subsystem 1 are compatible with all propositions a2

The functions f1 and f2 from Postulate P map propositions (projections) about
H1 ⊗H2 of the compound system. Therefore,
individual particles into the Hilbert space
they also map particle observables from
H2 to
H1 ⊗ H2. We will use small
H1 and
letters to denote observables of individual particles in
H1 ⊗ H2. Then positions and
momenta of particles 1 and 2 in the two-particle system will be denoted as p1, r1, p2,
and r2, the operator of energy of the particle 1 will be written as h1 =
1c2,
etc. The observables of diﬀerent particles commute with each other. We will keep using
capital letters for the total observables (H, P, J, and K) of the compound system.

Just as in the single-particle case, two-particle states can be also described by wave
functions. We can say that if ψ1(r1) is the wave function of particle 1 and ψ2(r2) is the
wave function of particle 2, then the wave function of the compound system is simply
a product3

ψ(r1, r2) = ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2)

INTERACTION

In this case, both particles 1 and 2, and the compound system are in pure quantum
states. However, the most general pure 2-particle state in
H1 ⊗ H2 is described by
a general function of two vector variables ψ(r1, r2) which is not necessarily expressed
In this case, individual subsystems are in mixed states:
in the product form (8.1).
the results of measurements performed on particle 1 are correlated with the results of
measurements performed on particle 2, even though the particles do not interact with
each other. The existence of such entangled states is a distinctive feature of quantum
mechanics which is not present in the classical world.

8.1.2

Statistics

The construction of the two-particle Hilbert space
H1 ⊗ H2 is valid when particles 1
and 2 are of diﬀerent species. If particles 1 and 2 are identical, then there are vectors
H1 ⊗H2 that do not correspond to physically realizable states, and the Hilbert space
in
of states is “less” than
H1 ⊗ H2. Indeed, if two particles 1 and 2 are identical, then
no measurable quantity will change if these particles change places. Therefore, after
permutation of two particles, the wave function may at most acquire an insigniﬁcant
unimodular phase factor α

ψ(r2, r1) = αψ(r1, r2)

(8.2)

If we swap the particles again then the original wave function must be restored

Therefore α2 = 1 which implies

ψ(r1, r2) = αψ(r2, r1)
= α2ψ(r1, r2)

α =

1
±

It then follows that the factor α must be the same for all states in the Hilbert space of
the compound system, otherwise there will be states which do not behave like (8.2). For
φ1(r1, r2)
example, if two states φ1 and φ2 have diﬀerent values of α, e.g., φ1(r2, r1) =
and φ2(r2, r1) = φ2(r1, r2), then the linear combination of these two states

−

ψ(r1, r2) = aφ1(r1, r2) + bφ2(r1, r2)

does not transform like (8.2)

This result implies that all particles in nature are divided in two categories: bosons
and fermions. For bosons α = 1 and the wave functions are symmetric with respect
to permutations. Wave functions of two bosons form a linear subspace
H1 ⊗sym H2 ⊂
H1 ⊗ H2. For fermions, α =
1 and the wave functions are antisymmetric with
respect to permutations. The Hilbert space of two identical fermions is the subspace
of antisymmetric functions

−

A remarkable spin-statistics theorem has been proven in the framework of quantum
ﬁeld theory. This theorem establishes (in full agreement with experiment) that the
symmetry of two-particle wave functions is related to their spin: all particles with
integer spin (e.g., photons) are bosons and all particles with half-integer spin (e.g.,
neutrinos, electrons, protons) are fermions.

All results of this section can be immediately generalized to the case of n-particle
system. For example, the Hilbert space of n identical bosons is the symmetrized tensor
⊗sym Hn, and the Hilbert space of n identical fermions

To complete our description of the 2-particle system initiated in the previous section we
need to specify an unitary representation Ug of the Poincar´e group in the Hilbert space
H1 ⊗ H2 may be expressed as
H
functions of particle observables p1, r1, p2, and r2, then we need to ﬁnd 10 Hermitian

which satisfy commutation relations of the Poincar´e Lie algebra (5.50) - (5.56). This
problem does not have a unique solution, and additional physical principles should
be applied to select operators (8.3) - (8.6) in agreement with observations. The con-
struction of the representation Ug is the most diﬃcult and the most important part of
relativistic quantum dynamics. It is important to realize that once this step is com-
pleted, we get everything we need for a full description of the physical system. This
approach to interaction is called relativistic Hamiltonian dynamics [49]. For complete-
ness, we should mention that there is a number of other non-Hamiltonian methods for
describing interactions. The overview of these methods and further references can be
found in [60, 61, 62]. We will not discuss these methods in the book.

(8.10)

The Poincar´e commutation relations for generators (H0, P0, J0, K0) follow immedi-
ately from the fact that generators of particles 1 and 2 satisfy Poincar´e commutation
relation separately and commute with each other, according to the Postulate P (II).
With deﬁnitions (8.7) - (8.10), the inertial transformations of particle observables are
easy to ﬁnd. For example, the position of particle 1 changes with time

r1(t) = e
¯h h1tr1e−
= e
= r1 + v1t

Therefore, the observables of particles 1 and 2 transform independently from each other
as if these particles were alone. So, representation (8.7) - (8.10) corresponds to the
absence of interaction and is called the non-interacting representation of the Poincar´e
group.

8.2.2 Dirac’s forms of dynamics

Obviously the simple choice of generators (8.7) - (8.10) is not realistic, because particles
in nature do interact with each other. Our approach for describing interactions in multi-
particle systems consists of choosing an interacting representation of the Poincar´e group
in

which is diﬀerent from the non-interacting representation

H

H = H0 + ∆H(r1, p1, r2, p2)
P = P0 + ∆P(r1, p1, r2, p2)
J = J0 + ∆J(r1, p1, r2, p2)

It may happen that some of the deltas on the right hand sides of eqs. (8.11) - (8.14)

free generators and transformations. Such generators and transformations are called

The description of interaction by eqs (8.11) - (8.14) generalizes the traditional
classical non-relativistic Hamiltonian dynamics in which the only dynamical generator
is H. To make sure that our theory reduces to the familiar non-relativistic approach in
the limit c
= 0. The choice of other generators is
restricted by the observation that kinematical transformations should form a subgroup
of the Poincar´e group, so the kinematical generators must form a subalgebra of the
Poincar´e Lie algebra. The set (P, J, K) does not form such a subalgebra. This explains
why in the relativistic case we cannot introduce interaction in the Hamiltonian alone.
We must add interaction terms to some of the other generators P, J, or K in order
to be consistent with relativity.6 We will say that interacting representations having
diﬀerent kinematical subgroups belong to diﬀerent forms of dynamics. In his famous
paper [2], Dirac provided a classiﬁcation of forms of dynamics based on these principles.
There are three forms of dynamics most frequently discussed in the literature. They
are shown in Table 8.1.
In the case of the instant form dynamics the kinematical
subgroup is the subgroup of spatial translations and rotations. In the case of point
form dynamics this is the Lorentz subgroup. In both cases the kinematical subgroup

6We can see from eqs. (2.7) - (2.14) that the set (P, J, K) does form a subalgebra of the non-
relativistic Galilei Lie algebra. This is why we are able to keep P, J, and K kinematical in that
case.

positions, i.e.,

Then, the diﬀerences of generators commute with one-particle observables

The above arguments imply that two diﬀerent projective representations can be
distinguished experimentally by measuring the time evolution of interacting particles
and/or inertial transformations of particle trajectories. Therefore, there must be a
unique representation and corresponding set of generators agreeing with experiment.
In particular, only one form of Dirac’s dynamics is consistent with experiment. What
is this form? We already discussed in subsection 1.1.2 that space translations and
rotations have kinematical eﬀects in a large range of translation and rotation param-
eters, i.e., P = P0 and J = J0. Only instant form of dynamics is consistent with
this requirement. Any other form of dynamics would imply dynamical action of shifts
and/or rotations which is inconsistent with observations.7 Therefore we postulate

•

Postulate R [instant form dynamics]: The unitary representation of the Poincar´e
group acting in the Hilbert space of any physical system belongs to the instant form
of dynamics.

7Strictly speaking, this argument is valid only for long-range interactions resulting in observable
macroscopic dynamics, i.e., the electromagnetic interactions and gravity. The form of dynamics
pertinent to the short-range weak and strong interactions is less certain, because the observations of
the time evolution during interaction are virtually impossible in these cases. However, in chapter 13,
we will argue that the experimentally observed slowing-down of the decay of fast moving unstable
particles is consistent only with the instant form of dynamics. Particles observed in these experiments
(e.g., muons) decay due to weak forces. This strongly suggests the instant form of weak interactions.

Instant form of dynamics

According to the Postulate R we can write

∆K. Just as V is usually called the potential
where we denoted V
energy operator, we will call Z the potential boost. Commutation relations (5.50) -
(5.56) then imply

∆H and Z

[(K0)i, Zj] + [Zi, (K0)j] + [Zi, Zj] = 0

[Z, H0] + [K0, V ] + [Z, V ] = 0

So, the task of constructing a relativistic interaction is reduced to ﬁnding a non-trivial
solution for the set of equations (8.17) - (8.21) with respect to V and Z.

follows. Denote
using formulas (6.34) - (6.37) from the non-interacting (P0, J0, K0, H0) and interacting
(P0, J0, K, H) generators, respectively. In a general instant form dynamics all three
operators R, S, and M may contain interaction terms. However, Bakamjian and
Thomas decided to look for a particular solution in which the position operator remains
kinematical R = R0. It then immediately follows that the spin operator is kinematical

From commutators (6.33), the interaction term U must satisfy

So, we have reduced our task of ﬁnding 4 operators V and Z satisfying complex equa-
tions (8.17) - (8.21) to a simpler problem of ﬁnding one scalar operator U commuting
with P0 and R0. Indeed, knowing U and non-interacting operators M0, P0, R0, and
S0, we can restore the interacting generators using formulas (6.38) - (6.40)

Now let us turn to the construction of U. Suppose that we found two vector opera-

such that they form a 6D Heisenberg algebra

Any operator in the Hilbert space

tions [U, P0] = [U, R0] = 0 can be expressed as a function of ~π and ~ρ only. To satisfy
the last condition [U, J0] = 0 we require U to be a function of rotationally invariant

So, the problem has reduced to ﬁnding operators of internal positions and momenta
satisfying eqs (8.26) - (8.28). This problem has been solved in a number of publications
[4, 63, 64, 65]. We will not need explicit formulas for the internal variables, so we will
not reproduce them here.

of relative variables ~π and ~ρ we will have n

8.3.2 General instant form of dynamics

In the Bakamjian-Thomas construction, it is assumed that R = R0, but this limitation
is rather artiﬁcial, and we will see later that realistic particle interactions do not satisfy
this condition. Any other variant of the instant form dynamics has position operator R
diﬀerent from the non-interacting Newton-Wigner position R0. Let us now establish a
connection between such general instant form interaction and the Bakamjian-Thomas
interaction. Suppose that operators

CHAPTER 8.

deﬁne a Bakamjian-Thomas dynamics, and W is a unitary operator commuting with
P0 and J0. 8 Then a non-Bakamjian-Thomas instant form of dynamics (P0, J0, K′, H ′)
can be build by applying the transformation W to the operators (8.32).

The above construction, however, does not answer the question if all instant form
interactions can be obtained by applying a unitary transformation to the Bakamjian-
Thomas dynamics? It has been proven in ref.
[7] that the answer to this question is
“yes”: For any instant form interaction one can ﬁnd a unitary transformation of its
generators to the Bakamjian-Thomas form. We can make this statement more plausible
by considering the following argument: An arbitrary instant form representation Ug in
is characterized by the operators of total momentum P0 and the
the Hilbert space
= R0. These operators furnish a reducible representation of
center-of-mass position R
. The non-interacting momentum P0 and position
the 6D Heisenberg algebra h6 in
R0 also provide a reducible representation of h6 in
. According to the Stone - von
Neumann theorem (see subsection A.6.2), these two representations must be connected
by a unitary operator W .

8.3.3 Cluster separability.

As we saw above, the requirement of relativistic invariance imposes rather loose con-
ditions on the interaction operators (they must be rotationally invariant functions of
relative variables). However, there is another physical requirement which limits the
admissible form of interaction. We know from experiment that all interactions between

8In the case of two massive spinless particles such an operator must be a function of rotationally

invariant combinations of vectors P0, ~π, and ~ρ.

(8.37)

This condition is not diﬃcult to satisfy in the two-particle case. However, in the
multi-particle case the mathematical condition for the interaction to be short-range
becomes rather complicated. This is because now there is more than one way to
separate particles in groups non-interacting with each other. The form of the n-particle
interaction (8.31) must ensure that each spatially separated m-particle group (m < n)
behaves as if it were alone. This, in particular, implies that we cannot independently
choose interactions in systems with diﬀerent number of particles. The interaction in
the n-particle sector of the theory must be consistent with interactions in all m-particle
sectors, where m < n.

We will say that interaction is cluster separable if for any division of a n-particle

(l + m = n)

(1) the interaction separates too, i.e., the clusters move independently from each
other;

(2) the interaction in each cluster is the same as in l-particle and m-particle
systems, respectively.

We will postulate that all interaction in nature have these properties

Postulate S [cluster separability]: All interactions are cluster separable.

•

In the non-relativistic case the cluster separability is achieved without much ef-
fort. For example, the non-relativistic Coulomb potential energy in the system of two
charged particles is10

and 3, the potential energy is normally written as

The spatial separation between particle 3 and the cluster of particles 1+2 can be
achieved by applying a large space translation to the particle 3. In agreement with
the Postulate S, such a translation eﬀectively cancels interaction between particles in
clusters 3 and 1+2, i.e.

has the property that no matter how far two pairs of particles (1+2 and 3+4) are

particles 1 and 2. Such inﬁnite-range interactions are not present in nature.

A linked m-particle potential V (i) is deﬁned as operator that depends on variables
of m particles and tends to zero if any particle or a group of particles is removed to
inﬁnity. For example, the potential (8.38) is linked while the potential (8.40) is not.11

8.3.4 Non-separability of the Bakamjian-Thomas dynamics.

We expect that Postulate S in subsection 8.3.3 is satisﬁed in the relativistic case as
well. It must apply to both potential energy and potential boosts. For example, in the
relativistic case of 3 spinless particles, the interacting generators are

H = H0 + V (p1, r1, p2, r2, p3, r3)
K = K0 + Z(p1, r1, p2, r2, p3, r3)

The cluster separability requires, for example, that

CHAPTER 8.

INTERACTION

Similarly, we can show that interaction V tends to zero when either particle 1 or par-
ticle 2 is removed to inﬁnity. Therefore, interaction V is a linked 3-particle potential.
According to the Postulate S, this means that there is no interaction in any 2-particle
subsystem: the interaction turns on only if there are three or more particles close to
each other, which is clearly wrong. So, we conclude that the Bakamjian-Thomas con-
struction cannot describe a non-trivial cluster-separable interaction in many-particle
systems (see also [67]).

8.3.5 Construction of a cluster separable 3-particle interac-

tion

The problem of construction cluster separable many-particle interactions can be solved
by allowing non-Bakamjian-Thomas instant form interactions. In this section we will
consider basic ideas of the approach presented in [7]. Our goal here is to construct
interacting Hamiltonian H and boost K in the Hilbert space
H1 ⊗ H2 ⊗ H3 of
a 3-particle system such that it satisﬁes the Postulate S from subsection 8.3.3, i.e.,
reduces to a non-trivial 2-particle interaction when one of the particles is removed to
inﬁnity.

Let us assume that the 2-particle potentials Vij and Zij resulting from removing

8.4 Bound states, dynamics, and scattering

Suppose we constructed an interacting representation of the Poincar´e group following
the above prescriptions. What can we learn from it about the physical system? In
this section we will discuss three types of information which can be compared with
experiment: mass and energy spectra, time dynamics, and scattering.

It is well-known that in the presence of attractive cluster separable interaction U,
new eigenvalues in the mass spectrum may appear below the threshold m1 + m2. This
eigenvalues (and new hyperboloids below the continuous part of the common spectrum
of P0 and H, shown in Fig. 8.1(b)) correspond to the bound states of interacting
particles.

8.4.2 Time evolution and scattering

In addition to the stationary energy spectra discussed above, we are often interested
in the time evolution of the system, i.e., reactions, scattering, decays, etc. In quantum
theory, the time evolution from time t′ to t is described by the time evolution operator

In the Schr¨odinger picture, the time evolution of the state vector is given by

Unfortunately, this formula has very limited value in the general case.

(8.63) and (8.64) is not needed:

However, nature gives us a lucky break here. It appears that in many situations
the description of dynamics by eq.
it is just too
detailed. Most experiments in high energy physics are performed by preparing free
particles or their bound states (like hydrogen atoms or deuterons), bringing them into
collision and studying the properties of free particles or bound states leaving the region
of collision. In these experiments, often it is not possible to observe the time evolution
during interaction: particle reactions occur almost instantaneously and we can only
register the reactants and products which move freely before and after the collision. In
such situations the theory is not required to describe the actual evolution of particles
during the short interval of collision. It is suﬃcient to provide a mapping of free states
before interaction onto the free states after the interaction. This mapping is given by
the S-operator which we are going to discuss in this section. In applications we are
mostly interested in the matrix elements of the S-operator, or scattering amplitudes

Formula (8.76) is not the only way to write the perturbation expansion for the S-
operator, and, probably, not the most convenient one. In most books on quantum ﬁeld
theory the covariant Feynman–Dyson perturbation expansion is used which involves
time ordering of operators in the integrand. However, for our purposes (especially in
chapter 12) we found more useful another equivalent expression suggested by Magnus
[68]

16We will avoid discussion of the non-trivial convergence issue and throughout this book we will
assume that all inﬁnite series do converge. Note also that the t-dependence of V (t) does not mean
that we are considering time-dependent interactions. Here we do not use the term time dependence,
because real time dependence must be generated by the full interacting Hamiltonian H and not by
the free Hamiltonian H0 as in eq. (8.75). Moreover, the t-dependence is reverse with respect to the
normal time dependence of operators in eq. (5.60). The t-dependence in eq. (8.75) is just added for
the convenience of calculation of the S-operator.

One important advantage of this representation is that the S-operator (8.79) is mani-
festly unitary.

It follows from equation

Scattering equivalence of Hamiltonians.

The S-operator and the Hamiltonian provide two diﬀerent ways to describe dynamics.
The Hamiltonian completely describes the time evolution in all time intervals. On the
other hand, the S-operator represents evolution in the “integral” form, i.e., knowing
, the free Hamiltonian H0, and
the state of the system in the inﬁnite past
the scattering operator S, we can ﬁnd the state in the inﬁnite future. In a somewhat

209

Calculations of the S-operator are much easier than those of the full time evolution,
and yet they fully satisfy the needs of current experiments in high energy physics.
This situation created an impression that a comprehensive theory can be constructed
which uses the S-operator as the fundamental quantity rather than the Hamiltonian
and wave functions. However, the S-operator description is not complete, and such a
theory would be applicable only to a limited class of experiments.

In particular, the knowledge of the S-operator is suﬃcient to calculate the scattering
cross-sections as well as energies and lifetimes of stable and metastable bound states.17
However, in order to describe the time evolution and the wavefunctions of the bound
states, the knowledge of the S-operator is not enough: the full interacting Hamiltonian
H is needed.

Knowing the full interacting Hamiltonian H, we can calculate the S-operator by
formula (8.76). However, the inverse is not true: the same S-operator can be obtained
from many diﬀerent Hamiltonians. Suppose that two Hamiltonians H and H ′ are
related to each other by a unitary transformation eiΦ

H ′ = eiΦHe−

Then they yield the same scattering (and Hamiltonians H and H ′ are called

scattering-equivalent) as long as condition

of dynamics (e.g., via eq.
Therefore scattering-equivalent theories may be not physically equivalent.

(8.69)) are diﬀerent with two Hamiltonians H and H ′.

The property of scattering equivalence is of great help in practical calculations.
If we are interested only in scattering properties and the spectrum of bound states,
we can choose among diﬀerent scattering-equivalent Hamiltonians the most convenient
one. Actually, we can even choose a non-instant form dynamics (e.g., the point form or
the front form), because Sokolov and Shatnii [6] have proved a remarkable result that
the same S-operator can be obtained in any form of dynamics. Of course, this result
does not mean that all physical results are insensitive to the chosen form of dynamics.
As discussed in section 8.2.3, the instant form of dynamics should be preferred when
time-dependent properties are considered.

Chapter 9

FOCK SPACE

Even within the community of particle physicists there
are those who think that the trend towards increasing
abstraction is turning theoretical physics into recreational
mathematics, endlessly amusing to those who can master
the techniques and join the game, but ultimately
meaningless because the objects of the mathematical
manipulations are forever beyond the access of
observation and mental visualization.
David Lindley

The theory of interacting particles was formulated in chapter 8 in the Hilbert space
with ﬁxed particle content. This theory is incomplete, because it cannot describe many
physical processes which can change the particle types and numbers. The persistence
of such processes at high energies follows from the famous Einstein’s formula E = mc2.
This formula, in particular, implies that if a system of particles has suﬃcient energy
E of their relative motion, then this energy may be converted to the mass m of newly
created particles. Generally, there is no limit on how many particles can be created
in collisions, so any realistic quantum mechanical description of high-energy systems
should involve states with any number of particles from zero to inﬁnity. The number
of particles is not conserved during time evolution. The familiar example of such a
behavior include the emission and absorption of light (photons) in electrodynamics,
decays, oscillations, etc. Therefore, in the most general description, the Hilbert space
must include states with any number of particles (from zero to inﬁnity) of all types.
Such a Hilbert space is called the Fock space.

In this chapter, and in the rest of this book (except chapter 13) we will consider a
world in which there are only ﬁve particle species: electrons e−, positrons e+, protons

211

212

CHAPTER 9. FOCK SPACE

p+, antiprotons p−, and photons γ. We will limit our discussion to electromagnetic
interactions between these particles, so we will neglect the internal structure of the
proton and completely disregard strong, weak and gravitational interactions. In other
words, we will build the description of these particles in terms of quantum electrody-
namics (QED).

9.1 Annihilation and creation operators

In this section we are going to build the Fock space
of QED and introduce creation
and annihilation operators which provide a very convenient notation for working with
arbitrary operators in the Fock space.

H

9.1.1

Sectors with ﬁxed number of particles.

The number of particles of a given type is readily measured in experiment, so we can
introduce 5 new observables in our theory: the numbers of electrons (Nel), positrons
(Npo), protons (Npr), antiprotons (Nan), and photons (Nph). According to the general
rules of quantum mechanics, these observables must be represented by ﬁve Hermitian
operators in the Fock space
. Apparently, the allowed values (the spectrum) for
the number of particles of each type are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). We assume
that these observables can be measured simultaneously, therefore the corresponding
operators commute with each other, and have common spectrum. So, the Fock space
separates into the direct sum of corresponding eigensubspaces or sectors
with i electrons, j positrons, k protons, l antiprotons, and m photons.

group. According to our discussion in section 8.1, sectors with two or more particles are
constructed as (anti)symmetrized tensor products of one-particle sectors. For example,
Hph the one-photon Hilbert space,

In each sector of the Fock space we can deﬁne observables of individual particles, e.g.,
position momentum, spin, etc., just as we did in subsection 8.1.1. Then, in each sector
we can select a basis of common eigenvectors of a full set of mutually commuting
observables. In subsection 8.1.1, we selected the basis of particles’ positions. However,
for future discussions it will be more convenient to use the basis in which momenta
and z-components of the spin σ of massive particles (or helicity τ of massless particles)
are diagonal. For example, the basis vectors in the two-electron sector
Hel ⊗asym Hel
are denoted by

p(1)σ(1); p(2)σ(2)

To complete the construction of the quantum theory we need to build a realistic
. Let us ﬁrst fulﬁll an easier task

interacting representation of the Poincar´e group in
H
and construct the non-interacting representation U 0
g of the Poincar´e group in

.

From subsection 8.2.1, we already know how to build the non-interacting represen-
tation of the Poincar´e group in each individual sector. This can be done by making
tensor products (with proper (anti)symmetrization) of single particle irreducible rep-
resentations U el
g , etc. Then the non-interacting representation of the Poincar´e
group in the entire Fock space is constructed as a direct sum of sector representations.
In agreement with the sector decomposition of the Fock space (9.1) - (9.9) we can write

The generators of this representation will be denoted as (H0, P0, J0, K0). As usual,
operators H0, P0, and J0 describe total energy, linear momentum, and angular mo-
mentum of the non-interacting system, respectively.

Here we immediately face a serious problem. Consider, for example, the free Hamil-

tonian

H0 = H0(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

H0(1, 0, 0, 0, 0)

H0(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)

H0(1, 0, 0, 0, 1)

It is tempting to use the notation from subsection 8.2.1 and express the Hamiltonian
in each sector using corresponding observables of individual particles p1, p2, etc. For
(1, 0, 0, 0, 0), the free Hamiltonian is
example, in the sector

However, this notation is very cumbersome because it does not provide a unique expres-
sion for the operator H0 in the entire Fock space. Moreover, it is not clear at all how
one can use this notation to express operators changing the number of particles, i.e.,
moving state vectors across the borders between diﬀerent sectors. We need to ﬁnd a
better and simpler way to write operators in the Fock space. This task is accomplished
by introduction of annihilation and creation operators in the next subsection.

9.1.2 Creation and annihilation operators for discrete spec-

trum of momentum.

First, it is instructive to consider the case of the discrete spectrum of momentum, i.e.,
assume that eigenvalues of momentum form a discrete 3D lattice pi. The standard
way to do that is to put the system in a box or apply periodic boundary conditions.
Then the usual continuous momentum spectrum can be obtained as a limit when the
size of the box tends to inﬁnity.

1Two photons are denoted by indices 1 and 2, and two electrons are denoted by indices 3 and 4

9.1. ANNIHILATION AND CREATION OPERATORS

215

Let us examine, for example, the case of electrons. We deﬁne the (linear) creation
operator a†p,σ for the electron with momentum p and spin projection σ by its action
on the basis vectors with n electrons

i

i

p(1)σ(1); p(2)σ(2); . . . ; p(n)σ(n)

|

(9.12)

We need to distinguish two cases. The ﬁrst case is when the one-particle state (p, σ) is
among the states listed in (9.12), for example (p, σ) = (p(i), σ(i)). Since electrons are
fermions, and two fermions cannot occupy the same state, this action leads to a zero
result, i.e.

a†p(i)σ(i)|

p(1)σ(1); p(2)σ(2); . . . ; p(n)σ(n)

= 0

(9.13)

The second case is when the created one-particle state (p, σ) is not among the states
listed in (9.12). Then the creation operator a†p,σ just adds an electron in the state
(p, σ) to the beginning of the list of particles

a†p,σ|

p(1)σ(1); p(2)σ(2); . . . ; p(n)σ(n)

=

pσ; p(1)σ(1); p(2)σ(2); . . . ; p(n)σ(n)

|
Operator a†p,σ has transformed the state with n electrons to the state with n + 1 elec-
trons. Applying multiple creation operators to the vacuum state
we can construct
all basis vectors in the purely electron sectors of the Fock space. For example,

is a basis vector in the 2-electron sector.

We deﬁne the electron annihilation operator ap,σ as operator adjoint to a†p,σ. It
can be proven (see [41]) that the action of ap,σ on the n-electron state (9.12) is the

For photons, which are bosons, the rules should be slightly modiﬁed. Two or more
bosons may coexist in the same state. Therefore, we deﬁne the action of the photon

The above formulas fully deﬁne the action of creation and annihilation operators2
on the basis vectors in purely electronic and photonic sectors. However, these rules
can be generalized to all states: they do not change if other particles are present, and
they can be extended to linear combinations of the basis vectors by linearity.

9.1.3 Commutators and anticommutators.

Although deﬁnitions (9.13) - (9.19) clearly express the meaning of particle operators,
they are not convenient in practical calculations. The commutation and anticommu-
tation relations between particle operators are much more useful. Let us ﬁrst consider
the anticommutator of fermion operators

ap′,σ′, a†p,σ}

{

= a†p,σap′,σ′ + ap′,σ′a†p,σ

2For brevity we will refer to creation and annihilation operators collectively as to particle operators.
This will distinguish them from operators of momentum, position, energy, etc. of individual particles
which will be called particle observables.

9.1.4 Creation and annihilation operators for the continuous

spectrum of momentum.

The properties of creation and annihilation operators presented in the previous section
are valid in the case of discrete spectrum of momentum. In the physical world, the
spectrum of momentum is continuous, and the above results should be modiﬁed by
taking the “large box” limit. We can guess that in this limit eq. (9.20) transforms to

The same arguments now can be applied to positrons (operators bp,σ and b†p,σ),
protons (dp,σ and d†p,σ), antiprotons (fp,σ and f †p,σ), and photons. So, ﬁnally, we

sities in the momentum space) by energies of free particles.

ators

Poincar´e transformations. Since, by construction, the non-interacting representation
U 0
g in the Fock space (generated by operators H0, P0, J0, and K0 described above)
coincides with these formulas in one-particle sectors, we can ﬁnd the transformations

CHAPTER 9. FOCK SPACE

9.2 Interaction potentials

Our primary goal in the rest of this chapter and next two chapters is to learn how to
calculate the S-operator in QED. Equations (8.75) and (8.76) tell us that in order to
do that we need to know the non-interacting H0 and interacting V parts of the full
Hamiltonian

H = H0 + V

The non-interacting Hamiltonian H0 has been constructed in eq. (9.34). The interac-
tion energy V (and the corresponding interaction boost Z) in QED will be explicitly
written only in chapter 11. Until then we are going to study rather general properties
of interactions and S-operators in the Fock space. We will try to use some physi-
cal principles to narrow down the allowed range of operators V which can serve as
interaction operators in QED.

9.2.1 Conservation laws.

From experiment we know that interaction V between charged particles has several
important properties called conservation laws. An observable F is called conserved if
it remains unchanged in the course of time evolution

F (t)

i

¯h HtF (0)e−

i
¯h Ht

e
≡
= F (0)

It then follows that conserved observables commute with the Hamiltonian operator
[F, H] = [F, H0+V ] = 0 which imposes some restrictions on the interaction operator V .
For example, the conservation of the total momentum and the total angular momentum
implies that the interaction must commute with the momentum operator

laws require that charged particles may be created or annihilated only together with
their antiparticles, i.e., in pairs. Creation of pairs is suppressed in low energy reactions
as such processes require additional energy of 2melc2 = 2
0.51MeV = 1.02MeV
for an electron-positron pair and 2mprc2 = 1876.6MeV for an proton-antiproton pair.
Therefore such processes can be safely neglected in most applications usually consid-
ered in classical electrodynamics. However, since photons have zero mass, the energetic
threshold for the photon emission is zero, and there are no restrictions on creation and
annihilation of photons. They can be created in any quantities.

9.2.2 Normal ordering

In the next subsection we are going to express general operators in the Fock space as
polynomials in particle creation and annihilation operators. But ﬁrst we need to over-
come one notational problem related to the non-commutativity of particle operators:
two diﬀerent polynomials may, actually, represent the same operator. To avoid this
problem, we will agree to always write products of operators in the normal order, i.e.,
creation operators to the left from annihilation operators. Among creation (annihila-
tion) operators we will enforce a certain order based on particle species: We will write
particle operators in the order proton - antiproton - electron - positron - photon from
left to right. With these rules and with relations (9.28) - (9.31) we can always convert
a product of particle operators to the normally ordered form. This is illustrated by
the following example

9.2.3 General form of interaction operator

A well-known theorem (see [41] p. 175) states that any operator V in the Fock space
satisfying conservation laws

[V, P0] = [V, J0] = [V, L] = [V, B] = [V, Q] = 0

(9.49)

can be written in the polynomial form4

4Expressions involving derivatives of particle operators, like eq. (9.37) can be approximated by

ﬁnite diﬀerences of operators (9.51).

terms VN M in the expansion (9.50) of the interaction Hamiltonian will be called poten-
tials. Each potential is a normally ordered product of N creation operators α† and M
annihilation operators α.5 The pair of integers (N, M) will be referred to as the index
of the potential VN M . A potential is called bosonic if it has an even number of fermion
particle operators Nf + Mf . Conservation laws (9.49) imply that all potentials in QED
must be bosonic.

DN M is a numerical coeﬃcient function which depends on momenta and spin pro-
jections (or helicities) of all created and annihilated particles.
In order to satisfy
[V, J0] = 0, the function DN M must be rotationally invariant. The translational invari-

play an important role in our calculations of the S-operator below. In what follows,

5Here symbols α† and α refer to generic creation and annihilation operators without specifying

the type of the particle.

6Note that this property does not apply to the energy: the sum of energies of annihilated particles

is not necessarily equal to the sum of energies of created particles.

228

CHAPTER 9. FOCK SPACE

when we write regular operator V without its t-argument, this means that either this
operator is t-independent, or that we take its value at t = 0.

One ﬁnal notational remark. If potential VN M has coeﬃcient function DN M , we

introduce notation VN M ◦

9.2.4

Five types of regular operators

In the previous subsection we established that interaction potentials in (9.50) and
individual terms in the perturbation expansion for the operators Σ (8.78) and F (8.80)
must obey conservation laws (9.49). Here we would like to get a further insight into the
nature of these operators by dividing them into ﬁve groups depending on their index
(N, M). We will call these types of operators decay, oscillation, renorm, unphys, and
phys). The rationale for introducing this classiﬁcation and nomenclature will become
clear in chapters 11 and 12 where we will discuss the renormalization and the “dressed
particle” approach in quantum ﬁeld theory.

Renorm operators have either index (0,0) (a numerical constant C) or index
(1,1) in which case both created and annihilated particles are required to have the
same mass. The most general form of renorm operator obeying the conservation laws
is the sum of a numerical constant C and terms corresponding to electrons, positrons,
etc.7

R = a†a + b†b + d†d + f †f + c†c + C

(9.55)

(Note that the free Hamiltonian (9.34) and the total momentum (9.35) are examples
of renorm operators.) The class of renorm operators is characterized by the property
that the energy function (9.53) is identically zero. So, renorm operators always have
energy shell where they do not vanish. Regular renorm operators do not depend on t.

Oscillation operators have index (1, 1). In contrast to renorm operators with
index (1,1). Oscillation operators destroy and create diﬀerent particle species having
diﬀerent masses. For this reason, the energy function (9.53) of an oscillation operator

7Here we write just the operator structure of R omitting all numerical factors, indices, integration

and summation signs.

230

CHAPTER 9. FOCK SPACE

never turns to zero, so there is no energy shell. In QED there can be no oscillation
operators as they would violate either lepton number or baryon number conservation
law. However, there are particles in nature, such as kaons and neutrinos, for which
oscillation interactions play a signiﬁcant role. They are responsible for mixing and
time-dependent oscillations between diﬀerent particle species [70].

Decay operators must satisfy two conditions:

1. they must have indices (1, N) or (N, 1) with N

2;

≥

2. they must have a non-empty energy shell;

There are no decay terms in the QED Hamiltonian and in the S-matrix: decays of
electrons, protons, or photons would violate conservation laws.8 Nevertheless, particle
decays play an important role in other areas of high energy physics, and they will be
considered in chapter 13.

Phys operators have at least two creation operators and at least two destruction

operators (index (N, M) with N

The operator properties discusses above are summarized in Table 9.1. These ﬁve types
of operators exhaust all possibilities, therefore any regular operator V must have a
unique decomposition

V (t) = V ren + V unp(t) + V dec(t) + V ph(t) + V osc(t).

As mentioned above, in QED interaction, oscillation and decay contributions are ab-
sent. So, everywhere in this book (except chapter 13) we will assume that

V (t) = V ren + V unp(t) + V ph(t)

Now we need to learn how to perform various operations with these classes of
operators, i.e., product, commutator, and t-integral, required for calculations of the
scattering operators in (8.78) or (8.80).

9.2.5 Adiabatic switching and t-integrals.

Lemma 9.1. A t-derivative of a regular operator A(t) is regular and has zero renorm
part.
Proof: The t-dependence of the derivative is characteristic for regular operators:

and the derivative obeys all conservation laws. Therefore, it is regular.

Suppose that d

dt A(t) has a renorm part R. Then R is t-independent and originates from a derivative of the term
Rt + S in A(t), where S is t-independent. Since A(t) is regular, and Rt does not have the t-independence characteristic
for renorm operators, we conclude that R = 0.

? The origin of
What shall we do with the term on the right hand side containing
this problem can be traced back to our derivation of the S-operator in subsection 8.4.4.
In this derivation we assumed certain properties of the scattering states. In particular,
we assumed that the time evolution of these states coincides with free evolution in
the distant past and distant future. However, these assumptions cannot be applied
to all states in the Hilbert space. For example, the time evolution of bound states
of the interacting Hamiltonian H, does not resemble the free evolution at any time.
Actually, the application of the S-operator is limited to states
consisting of one-
particle wave packets with good localization in both position and momentum spaces
(see subsection 7.3.3). These wave packets are initially separated by a large distance
and move freely, then they approach each other and interact, then move apart from
each other, and, eventually, separate and move freely again. Therefore, for such states

obvious from the general form of the interaction operator (9.50). One approach to
the exact treatment of scattering is to explicitly consider only wave packets described
above. Then cluster separability of V will ensure the correct behavior of the wave
packets: However, such an approach is rather complicated, and we would like to stay
away from considering the wave packets by dealing exclusively with operators. There
is a way to achieve this goal by using a trick called the adiabatic switching of the
interaction. The trick is to add the property (9.57) to the interaction operator “by
hand”. This is done by multiplying V (t) by a numerical function of t which slowly
grows from the value of zero at t =
0 (when interaction

takes place) and then slowly decreases back to zero at t =

The same argument is valid for unphys operators having index (0, N ). Therefore, the only remaining possibility for A

9.2.7 Two-particle potentials.

Our next goal is to express the n-particle potentials studied in subsection 8.3.3 using the
formalism of annihilation and creation operators. These potentials conserve the number
and types of particles, so they must have equal numbers of creation and annihilation
operators (N

We know from subsection 8.3.3 that many-particle linked potentials must tend to
zero if any one particle is removed to inﬁnity. This condition is easy to verify by looking
at the coordinate-space representation of the interaction operator, e.g., (8.39). Many
calculations are easier in the momentum representation, and we will ﬁnd it useful that
linked potentials can be recognized by looking at their momentum-space representation
as well. Let us consider the 2-particle potential (9.66) as an example. Applying space

In the limit a
the exponent in the integrand of (9.70) is a rapidly oscillating
function of k. If the coeﬃcient function V (p, e, k) is smooth and bounded as a function
of k then the integral over k is zero due to the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma.14 Therefore,
the corresponding potential is linked, according to our deﬁnition in subsection 8.3.3.
The same approach works for more complex potentials like (9.51). As discussed in
subsection 8.3.3, a cluster separable interaction must be a sum of linked potentials,
therefore

•

Statement T [cluster separability]: The cluster separability of the interaction
(9.50) is ensured if the coeﬃcient functions DN M of all potentials VN M are smooth

inﬁnity [72].

CHAPTER 9. FOCK SPACE

9.3 Model theory

Before considering real interactions between charged particles and photons, in this
section we introduce a simple yet quite realistic model theory with variable number of
particles. In this theory, the perturbation expansion of the S-operator can be evaluated
with minimal eﬀorts, in particular, with the help of the diagram technique. In section
11.3 we will use this simpliﬁed model again in order to illustrate the renormalization
program.

9.3.1

Fock space and the Hamiltonian

The model theory introduced here is an approximation to QED which describes only
electrons and photons and their interactions. So, we will work in the part of the Fock
space which has no other particles. This Fock space is a direct sum of sectors described
in formulas (9.1) - (9.9). We will also assume that interaction does not aﬀect the spin
and polarization degrees of freedom, so the corresponding labels will be omitted, and
the anticommutation and commutation relations of particle operators will be written
as

[a†p, c†p′] = [a†p, cp′] = [ap, c†p′] = [ap, cp′] = 0.

The interacting Hamiltonian H = H0 + V1, as usual, is the sum of the free Hamiltonian

and the interaction, which we choose in the following form

The coupling constant e will be tentatively associated with the absolute value of
the electron charge. Here and in what follows the perturbation order of an operator
(= the power of the coupling constant e) is shown by the subscript. For example, the
free Hamiltonian H0 does not depend on e, so it is of zero perturbation order; V1 is of
the ﬁrst perturbation order, etc.

Interaction (9.75) is unphys.15 The above theory satisﬁes conservation laws

[H, Q] = [H, P0] = [H, J0] = 0,

The number of electrons is conserved by the interaction (9.75), but the number of
photons can be changed. So, this theory is capable of describing important processes
of the photon emission and absorption. However, it has two major drawbacks. First,
it is not relativistically invariant. This means that it is not possible to construct an
interacting boost operator K such that the Poincar´e commutation relations with H,
P0, and J0 are satisﬁed. In this section we will tolerate this deﬁciency, but in chapter
11 we will show how the relativistic invariance can be satisﬁed in a more comprehensive
theory (QED) which includes both particles and antiparticles. The second drawback
1/2 in (9.75), the interaction V1 does not
is that due the presence of singularity k−
satisfy our criterion of cluster separability (Postulate S in subsection 8.3.3). A closer
inspection reveals that the singularity is related to the zero photon mass, and a similar
problem is also present in the QED interaction discussed in section 11.1. In spite of the
singularity, the interaction is still separable, though it has a long range (the Coulomb
potential). Another related problem, common for our model theory and QED, is due
to so-called infrared divergences. Physically, these divergences reﬂect the fact that an
unlimited number of photons can be created in scattering processes. The techniques
for dealing with infrared divergences are well established (see, e.g., [41, 73]) and they
will not be discussed in this book. The easiest way to avoid such divergences in our
calculations is to assign a ﬁctitious small mass to photons. Although, we are not
going to indicate this explicitly, we will pretend that such a modiﬁcation is done, so
that the k = 0 singularities are removed from the coeﬃcient functions of interaction
potentials in (9.75). Then, the coeﬃcient functions become bounded in agreement with
the Statement T.

15The energy shell equations for the two terms in (9.75) are

ωp + c
ωp−k + c

k
|
|
k

|

= ωp+k

The only solution for both these equations is k = 0, but zero vector is excluded from the photon
momentum spectrum (see subsection 7.4.1), so the energy shell of the potential (9.75) is empty.

9.3.2 Drawing a diagram in the model theory.

Our primary goal in this section is to introduce the diagram technique which greatly
facilitates perturbative calculations of scattering operators (8.78) and (8.80). Let us
graphically represent each term in the interaction potential (9.76) as a vertex (see
Fig. 9.1). Each particle operator in (9.75) is represented as an oriented line or arrow.
The line corresponding to the annihilation operator enters the vertex, and the line
corresponding to the creation operator leaves the vertex. Electron lines are shown by
full arcs and photon lines are shown by broken arrows. Each line is marked with the
momentum label of the corresponding particle operator. Free ends of the electron lines
are attached to the vertical electron “order bar” on the left hand side of the diagram,
and free ends of the photon lines are attached to the vertical photon “order bar” on the
right hand side of the diagram. The order of these external lines (from bottom to top
of the order bar) corresponds to the order of particle operators in the potential (from
right to left). An additional numerical factor is indicated in the upper left corner of
the diagram.

The t-integral V1(t) diﬀers from V1(t) only by the factor i¯hE−

V1 (see eq. (9.58))
which is represented in the diagram by drawing a box that crosses all external lines. A
line entering (leaving) the box contributes its energy with the negative (positive) sign
to the energy function EV1. The diagram representation of the integral

according to equation (9.72). Diagrams 9.3(f) and 9.3(g) are obtained from 9.3(c) in
a similar way.

9.3.3 Reading a diagram in the model theory.

Using diagrams, with some practice, one can perform calculations of scattering op-
erators (8.78) and (8.80) much easier than in the usual algebraic way. During these
diagram manipulations we, actually, do not need to keep momentum labels of lines.
The algebraic expression of the result can be easily restored from an unlabeled diagram
by following these steps:

(I) Assign a distinct momentum label to each external line, except one, whose mo-
mentum is obtained from the condition that the sum of all incoming external
momenta minus the sum of all outgoing external momenta is zero.

(II) Assign momentum labels to internal lines so that the momentum conservation

(III) Read external lines from top to bottom of the order bar and write corresponding

particle operators from left to right.

(IV) For each box, write a factor i¯h(Ef −

1, where Ef is the sum of energies of
Ei)−
particles going out of the box and Ei is the sum of energies of particles coming
into the box.

(V) Write a factor e−

¯h EY t, where EY is the energy function of the diagram which is
the sum of energies of all outgoing external lines minus the sum of energies of all
incoming external lines.

(VI) For each vertex introduce a factor

photon line attached to this vertex.

now, we also ignore the contribution of the renorm term in (9.80).17 Then we obtain

9.3.6 Cluster separability of the S-operator

Due to the Postulate S, all interactions considered in this book are cluster separable,
i.e., they can be represented as sums of linked potentials. It is interesting to see how
this property is reﬂected in the properties of the S-operator. According to eqs. (8.78
) and (8.80), calculations of the S-operator involve products or commutators of the
interaction potentials. The question about the linkedness or smoothness of a product
of linked potentials is not trivial because the calculation of the product (9.86) involves
pairings, pairings produce delta functions, and, in order to prove the smoothness, we
need to make sure that there are enough integrals to integrate out all these delta
functions except one delta function required by the conservation of momentum, as in
(9.51).

Theorem 9.8 A term y in the expansion (9.87) of the product of smooth potentials is
smooth if and only if it is represented by a connected diagram.
Proof: Each potential V (i) in the product (9.86) has N (i) creation operators, M (i) annihilation operators, and N (i) +
i=1 N (i) + M (i) integrals (and independent
M (i) integrals. Then each term y in the expansion (9.87) has
delta functions which express the conservation of the total momentum for
integration variables). This term also has
pairs of external lines in the factors V (i) are
each of the factors V (i). Moreover, in the process of normal ordering,
new delta-functions. So, the total number of delta functions in y is
joined together to make
,
internal lines and

. For the term y to be of the form (9.51), the number of integrals should

. If the diagram corresponding to y

E
is connected, then the number of loops is
1 integrations,
thus canceling all but one delta function which is required by the general form (9.51). If the term y is represented
by a disconnected diagram, the number of independent loops is greater than
+ 1. So, the number of allowed
integrations is less than
1. The number of remaining delta functions is greater than 1. The coeﬃcient function
of the expression is singular, and the corresponding operator is not smooth.

Thus we established that there is no diﬀerence between smooth, linked, and con-

prove that all terms in a multiple commutator (like those in eq. (8.80)) are connected,
and, therefore, smooth.

Theorem 9.9 A multiple commutator of connected bosonic potentials is connected.
Proof: Let us ﬁrst consider a single commutator of potentials V (1) and V (2).

First, we are going to prove that the disconnected part of their product does not depend on the order of the product

The two sides of eq. (9.90) diﬀer only by the order of particle operators. So, after all particle operators are brought to
the normal order, they may diﬀer, at most, by a sign. The order of boson particle operators does not aﬀect the sign, so
it can be ignored. Let us now focus only on fermionic particle operators in V (1) and V (2). We may formally write the
factors as

where F is a series of multiple commutators (8.80). According to Theorems 9.8 and
9.9, if V is a sum of linked potentials (i.e., cluster separable), then F and F
are
connected and cluster separable. Then, if all particles are divided into two spatially
separated groups 1 and 2, the argument of the exponent in (9.93) takes the form of a
sum

|{z}

acts only on the variables of the group 1 and F (2)

where F (1)
acts only on the variables
of the group 2, so these two operators commute with each other. Then, the S-operator

9.3.7 Convergence of loop integrals.

In the previous subsection we showed that the terms described by connected diagrams
are smooth. However, such terms involve loop integrals, and generally there is no
guarantee that these integrals converge. The problem of inﬁnities is evident in our
model theory: the loop integral by k in diagram 3(g) is divergent.19

19For future reference we may note that 3D integral of function f (k)

diverges at large k if the integrand f (k) tends to zero as k−3 or slower. The integrand in (9.94)
satisﬁes this criterion: its asymptotic behavior is

k−2.

So, the scattering phase in the second order F2

is inﬁnite, which is not acceptable.

Actually, the appearance of inﬁnities in products and commutators of potentials
(8.70) and (8.72) is a commonplace in quantum ﬁeld theories. So, we need to better
understand this phenomenon. In this subsection, we will discuss the convergence of
loop integrals and we will formulate a condition (Theorem 10, that will be used in
section 12.1) under which the loop integrals are convergent.

|{z}

Let us consider, for example, the diagram in Fig. 9.4. There are three diﬀerent

reasons why the loop integrals may diverge.

(I) The coeﬃcient functions DA, DB, . . . may contain singularities.

(II) There can be also singularities due to zeros in energy denominators EA and

EC + ED.

(III) The coeﬃcient functions DA, DB, . . . may not decay fast enough for large values
of loop momenta, so that the integrals may be divergent due to the inﬁnite
integration range.

As discussed in subsection 9.3.1, the singularities in the coeﬃcient functions are avoided
if we introduce a ﬁctitious small photon mass. The energy denominators also may be
assumed ﬁnite if we use the adiabatic switching prescription from subsection 9.2.5. The
divergence of integrals at large momentum or ultraviolet divergence (point (III) above)
is a more serious problem, which we are going to discuss here. We would like to show
that the divergence of loop integrals is closely related to the behavior of coeﬃcient
functions of potentials far from the energy shell. In particular, we would like to prove
the following

Theorem 9.10.
If coeﬃcient functions of potentials decay suﬃciently rapidly (e.g.,
exponentially) when arguments move away from the energy shell, then all loop integrals
converge.
Idea of proof: Eq. (9.88) is integral in a 12-dimensional space of 4 loop momenta p6, p7, p8, and p9. Let us denote
this space Σ. Consider for example the dependence of the integrand in (9.88) on the loop momentum p9 as p9
→ ∞
and all other momenta ﬁxed. Note that we have chosen the integration variables in Fig. 9.4 in such a way that each
loop momentum is present only in the internal lines forming the corresponding loop, e.g., momentum p9 is conﬁned to
the loop BDCB, and the energy function EA of the vertex A does not depend on p9. Such a selection of integration
p
variables can be done for any arbitrary diagram. Taking also into account that at large values of momentum ωp

This analysis is applicable to all loop variables: Any loop has a bottom vertex (vertex B in our example), a top vertex
(vertex D in our example), and possibly a number of intermediate vertices (vertex C in our example). As the loop
momentum goes to inﬁnity, the energy functions of the top and bottom vertices tend to inﬁnity, i.e., move away from
the energy shell. Take an arbitrary direction to inﬁnity in the space Σ. Along this direction, there is at least one
loop momentum which goes to inﬁnity. Then there is at least one energy function (EA, EB, EC , or ED) which grows
linearly. Therefore, according to the condition of the theorem, the integrand decreases rapidly (e.g., exponentially)
along this direction. These arguments are valid for all directions in the space Σ. Therefore the integrand rapidly tends
to zero in all directions, and integral (9.88) converges.

In chapter 11 we will see that in realistic theories, like QED, the asymptotic decay
of the coeﬃcient functions of potentials is not fast enough, so Theorem 9.10 is not
applicable, and loop integrals diverge. A detailed discussion of divergences in quantum
ﬁeld theory and their elimination will be presented in sections 11.3 and 12.1.

QUANTUM FIELDS

If it turned out that some physical system could not
be described by a quantum ﬁeld theory, it would
be a sensation; if it turned out that the system
did not obey the rules of quantum mechanics and
relativity, it would be a cataclysm.
Steven Weinberg

From our discussion in the previous chapter we know how to build cluster separable
interacting Hamiltonian H = H0 + V which, in addition, may not conserve the number
of particles. The same ideas can be applied for constructing cluster separable boost
operators K = K0 + Z. To ensure the relativistic invariance, we must select interac-
tion terms in V and Z consistent with each other, so that equations (8.17) - (8.21) are
satisﬁed. For interactions written in terms of particle operators (9.50) - (9.51) this is
a very diﬃcult task (see, however, [74]). In this chapter we will discuss a formalism
which provides a relatively simple solution of this problem. This formalism is called the
quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT). The idea of QFT is that construction of Poincar´e invari-
ant interactions can be simpliﬁed if certain linear combinations of particle operators
(quantum ﬁelds) are used as building blocks.1

10.1 Construction of the quantum ﬁeld theory

In simple QFT theories, the construction of interactions proceeds in three steps

1This is how the main idea of QFT is understood by the author of this book. Traditional textbook

presentations of QFT assign much greater physical importance to quantum ﬁelds.

CHAPTER 10. QUANTUM FIELDS

Step 1 For each particle type (including both particle and its antiparticle) participating
in the theory we construct a quantum ﬁeld which is a multicomponent operator
function φi(x, t) on the Minkowski space-time satisfying the following conditions

(I) It contains only terms linear in creation or annihilation operators of particle

and its antiparticle, i.e., having index (0,1) or (1,0).

(II) The quantum ﬁeld is required to transform as

with respect to the non-interacting representation of the Poincar´e group in
the Fock space (see subsection 9.1.5), where Λ is a Lorentz transformation,
a is a space-time translation, and Dij is a ﬁnite-dimensional representation
of the Lorentz group, which depends on the particle type.2

(III) It turns to zero at x-inﬁnity, i.e.

lim

(IV) Fermion ﬁelds at points x and x′ are required to anticommute if (x

which is eq. (8.18). We are not going to prove other commutators here, because it
appears that formulas (10.7) and (10.8) work only for simplest QFT models. More
interesting cases, such as QED discussed in chapter 11, require some modiﬁcations in
this scheme, in particular, addition of some extra terms on the right hand side of eq.

10.2 Quantum ﬁeld for fermions

10.2.1 Construction of the fermion ﬁeld

According to the Step 1 in section 10.1, we need to associate with each particle type
a ﬁnite-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group and a quantum ﬁeld. In this
section we are going to build the quantum ﬁeld for electrons and positrons. We postu-
late that this Dirac ﬁeld has 4 components and transforms according to the 4D spinor
representation of the Lorentz group (see subsection A.7.2) and has the following form5

For brevity, we denote p

meaning, only their combinations in the potential energy operator V (x, t) are important. Therefore,
we choose the normalization so as to make formulas for V (x, t) simple (see subsection 11.1.3).

10.2.2 Properties of factors u and v

The key components in the expression (10.10) for the ﬁeld are numerical functions
uασ(p) and vασ(p). We can represent them as 4
2 matrices with index i = 1, 2, 3, 4
enumerating rows and index σ =
1/2, 1/2 enumerating columns. Let us ﬁrst postulate

QUANTUM
ELECTRODYNAMICS

All of physics is either impossible or trivial.
It is impossible until you understand it, and then
it becomes trivial.
Ernest Rutherford

The next step in developing QED is formulation of the interacting representation of the
Poincar´e group in the Fock space. In section 11.1 we will write down the interaction
terms in the Hamiltonian and boost operators and prove that the resulting theory is
relativistically invariant, i.e., the commutation relations (8.17) - (8.21) are satisﬁed.
In section 11.2 we will discuss how the S-matrix elements can be calculated in lowest
orders of the perturbation theory. In section 11.3, we will ﬁnd out that the Hamiltonian
of QED actually leads to inﬁnite results in higher order contributions to the S-matrix.
We will describe the important procedure of renormalization which allows to obtain
physically sensible results in all orders.

11.1

Interaction in QED

11.1.1 ”Derivation” of interactions in QED

Our goal in this section is to formulate the interacting representation U(Λ, a) of the
Poincar´e group in the Fock space. As we discussed in previous chapters, the knowledge
of this representation (more speciﬁcally, the interaction operators V and Z) is suﬃcient
for obtaining any desired physical information about systems composed of charged
particles and photons.

277

278

CHAPTER 11. QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS

The traditional approach to QED claims derivation of the interacting Hamiltonian
H = H0 +V according to the following steps described in most textbooks on QFT (see,
e.g., [41]). The derivation is based on the idea that the time evolution of interacting
ﬁelds minimizes action S which is a t-integral of the Lagrangian

S =

∞

L(t)dt

Z

−∞

The Lagrangian L(t) of the theory is deﬁned in analogy with the classical Maxwell
theory. The Lagrangian is an operator in the Fock space constructed from quantum
ﬁelds and their derivatives with respect to t and x. The Lagrangian is chosen to
be (i) local,1 and (ii) gauge invariant.2 Then a particular gauge is chosen and the
Hamiltonian is derived by the “canonical constraint quantization” technique. This
procedure, indeed, results in a very successful interaction Hamiltonian which allows to
predict (after renormalization described in section 11.3) scattering cross-sections and
energies of bound states with astonishing degree of accuracy. However, the physical
interpretation of the ﬁeld quantization procedure remains rather obscure. For example,
the quantum ﬁelds deﬁned in the previous chapter and used to construct the Lagrangian
are just formal combinations of particle operators, and they do not correspond to any
measurable quantities. Fermion ﬁelds are not Hermitian operators, so they cannot be
observed. The photon ﬁeld is not deﬁned unambiguously; it depends on the chosen
gauge. Even electric and magnetic ﬁelds (usually obtained as derivatives of the photon
ﬁeld) are not experimentally measured quantities.3 The formal character of quantum
ﬁelds is clear also from the fact that their arguments t and x have no relationship to
measurable time and position. The variable t is the parameter which we used in (9.52)
to describe the “t-dependence” of regular operators generated by the non-interacting
Hamiltonian H0. Three variables x are just coordinates in the abstract Minkowski
space-time, and we do not attempt to relate them to physical positions of particles.
Moreover, as seen from eqs. (8.76) and (10.7) - (10.8), the parameters t and x are just
integration variables, and they are not present in the ﬁnal expression for the measurable
quantity - the S-matrix.

The Lagrangian and action are Hermitian operators, but their (and their eigen-
values’) relationships to experimentally observed quantities remain undeﬁned. The

1i.e., composed of ﬁelds (and their derivatives) at the same “spacetime points” (x, t).
2i.e., unchanged after multiplying the fermion ﬁelds by the phase factor eiε(x) and simultaneous

addition of ∂µε(x) to the photon ﬁeld.

3Each time the “ﬁeld strength” is allegedly measured at a point, we are measuring, in fact, the
force on a test charge at this point. This force is generated by nearby charges. So, we would not lose
any physical information if we can ﬁnd a way to “integrate ﬁelds out”, i.e., to reformulate the theory
in terms of observable quantities only, such as positions and velocities of particles and (distance-
dependent and velocity-dependent) forces between them. This is exactly the kind of approach we are
developing in this book (see chapter 12).

11.1.

INTERACTION IN QED

279

physical meaning of the “locality” condition is not clear as well. In particular, it is not
true (as often stated) that locality is necessary for relativistic invariance. It has been
shown in [75, 76] that the conditions of relativistic invariance and cluster separability
can be satisﬁed in non-local quantum ﬁeld theories as well.

As we discussed in subsection 3.1.3, the classical wave (or ﬁeld) theory is not
adequate. For example, it disregards the discrete corpuscular nature of light, there
are signiﬁcant problems with describing the “radiation reaction” [77], etc. As classical
Maxwell theory is an approximate description of reality, the canonical ﬁeld quantization
should be considered only as a heuristic approach at best. Ideally, a quantum theory
should not appear via “quantization” of its classical counterpart. It must be formulated
independently, though such a formulation is a diﬃcult task (see discussion at the end
of subsection 12.3.1).

In this book we do not pretend to derive QED interactions from ﬁrst principles. We
simply borrow from the traditional approach the form of four interacting generators of
the Poincar´e group H and K as functions of quantum ﬁelds ψα(x), Ψα(x), and aµ(x). In
contrast to the standard interpretation of QFT, we are not trying to present quantum
ﬁelds as “the most fundamental ingredients of nature”. We also do not try to assign
any physical meaning to the Dirac equation and Maxwell equations formally satisﬁed
by the ﬁelds. We consider quantum ﬁelds simply as convenient mathematical objects.
The value of the ﬁeld notation is in allowing us to write the interacting representation
of the Poincar´e group in a compact form (see subsection 11.1.3) and in simplifying the
proof of the relativistic invariance of the theory (see subsection 11.1.4). However, after
these steps are completed, it makes more sense to express H and K through particle
creation and annihilation operators and discard the ﬁelds altogether. The ﬁelds are no
longer needed for practical calculations, and there are no ﬁelds, gauges, Lagrangians,
etc. in our approach.

11.1.2 Current density

In the construction of the QED interaction, an important role is played by the operator
of the current density which is deﬁned as a sum of the electron and proton current
densities

jµ(x) = jµ

pr(x)

el(x) + jµ
eψ†(x)γ0γµψ(x) + eΨ†(x)γ0γµΨ(x)

=

where gamma matrices γµ are deﬁned in eqs (A.85) and (A.86).

Let us consider the electron-positron part of the current density

and derive three important properties of this operator (the proton-antiproton current
density has similar properties). First, we will ﬁnd out how the current density trans-
forms with respect to boost Λ. Using formula (A.92) and

Third, the equal time anticommutators of the electron ﬁeld (10.23) imply

11.1.3

Interaction operators.

We postulate that the total Hamiltonian of QED is4

H = H0 + V

(11.4)

where the non-interacting Hamiltonian H0 is that from eq. (9.34), and the interaction
is

Here and in what follows we denote the power of the coupling constant e (the pertur-
bation order of an operator) by a subscript, i.e., H0 is zero order, V1 is ﬁrst order, V2
is second order, etc. The ﬁrst order interaction is the 4-scalar product

V (t) =

dxV (x, t)

Z

= V1(t) + V2(t)

V1(t) =

(The last equality follows from eq. (A.75) and a0(x, t) = 0). The second order inter-
action is

gauge version of QED [41, 78].

Interaction (11.5) is manifestly Hermitian. Moreover, since all factors j, j0, and a
commute with each other at equal times, the potential energy density commutes with
itself at space-like separations.

so the conditions (I) and (II) from Step 2 in section 10.1 are satisﬁed.

5Note that the presence of the additional term Ωµ(x, Λ) in the transformation law of the photon
ﬁeld (10.35) does not allows us to deﬁne the boost interaction by simple formula (10.8). Additional
third term in (11.8) is required to ensure the Poincar´e invariance of the theory as will be demonstrated
in the next section.

11.1.4 Relativistic invariance of QED

In this section we are going to prove the relativistic invariance of the theory constructed
above (see [41, 78, 79]), i.e., the validity of commutators (8.17) - (8.21). Operators
V1(t) and V2(t) clearly commute with operators of total momentum and total angular
momentum,

The commutator

[P0, V (t)] = [J0, V (t)] = 0

[(P0)i, Zj(t)] =

i¯h
c2 V (t)δij

can be proven similarly to eq. (10.9). The proof of eq. (8.21)

[(K0)z, V1(t)] + [(K0)z, V2(t)] = i¯h

Zz(t) + [V (t), Zz(t)]

CHAPTER 11. QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS

where C1 and C2 are constants. In this notation it is clear that jµ(x) commutes with
the lepton number operator (9.44) and the baryon number operator (9.46). Therefore
jµ(x) also commutes with the operator of electric charge (9.48). Using this property, it
is easy to prove that interactions in the Hamiltonian (11.6) and (11.7) and in the boost
operator (11.8) also commute with the operator of charge Q, as required for regular
operators

[H, Q] = [K, Q] = 0

In what follows we will focus on interactions between electrons and protons with
the goal to provide a description of the hydrogen atom (see subsection 12.2.4). So, we
can keep only terms in S having operator structure D†A†DA. Then, it is suﬃcient to
keep just two terms in the expression (11.31) for the current

When calculating expression [V 1, V1] with V1 from (11.32) and V 1 from (11.35) we
just need to keep the terms having operator structure A†AD†D. Therefore, we need
to consider four commutators: the 1st term in V 1 commuting with the 4th term in V1,
the 2nd term in V 1 commuting with the 3rd term in V1, the 3rd term in V 1 commuting
with the 2nd term in V1, and the 4th term in V 1 commuting with the 1st term in V1.

momenta of protons are much less than Mc. Therefore we can represent the above

This result is consistent with our model theory (9.84). The diﬀerence in sign is related

CHAPTER 11. QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS

11.3 Renormalization.

In spite of successful prediction of the scattering amplitudes in the 2nd perturbation
order (see, e.g., eq. (11.39)), there is a very serious problem with the formalism of
QED presented above. This is the problem of ultraviolet divergences: If we continue
calculations of the contributions to the S-operator to higher perturbation orders, we
would ﬁnd that they are inﬁnite. Discussion of high order scattering amplitudes in QED
requires rather elaborate calculations. To make our presentation relatively simple,
and, at the same time, retaining important features pertinent to QED, we will discuss
here the model theory from section 9.3. We will perform the elimination of inﬁnities
(renormalization) from the S-operator up to the 4-th order of perturbation theory, and
return to the discussion of QED in arbitrary perturbation order in subsection 11.3.5.

11.3.1 Regularization.

As discussed in subsection 9.3.5, diagrams representing high order contributions to
scattering processes inevitably contain loops. We saw in subsection 9.3.7 that, in
general, there is always a danger that loop integrals may be divergent. One way to
overcome this diﬃculty is by using regularization. The idea of regularization is to
modify the theory in such a way that all loop integrals are made ﬁnite. There are
many diﬀerent ways to achieve this goal. For example, we can simply introduce a
momentum cut-oﬀ in all momentum integrals. At the end of calculations the cutoﬀ
momentum should be set to inﬁnity, of course. Although the regularization is required
for mathematical rigor, it substantially lengthens the calculations. In our studies we
will not perform the regularization explicitly. Instead, we will formally treat the loop
integrals “as if” they were ﬁnite. If a proper care is taken, this approach leads to the
same ﬁnal result as any regularized theory in the limit of inﬁnite cutoﬀ. When we say
that a quantity is inﬁnite, we actually mean that this quantity does not tend to a ﬁnite
value in the limit of inﬁnite cutoﬀ.

11.3.2 General condition for the mass renormalization.

Although the regularization is a useful tool allowing us to operate with well-deﬁned
ﬁnite expressions, by itself, it does not solve the problem of inﬁnities in QFT. Even
if we force all loop integrals to be ﬁnite, the S-operator may still be inﬁnite. Let us
now consider in greater detail how these inﬁnities appear and what can we do about
them. Generally, the scattering phase operator F in (8.80) may have unphys, phys,
and renorm terms, so we can write the S-operator in the form

i F

S = e

|{z}

299

(11.41)

where we noticed that unphys terms in F do not contribute to the S-operator due to
eq. (9.63). Let us now apply the scattering operator (11.41) to the one-electron state
p
. It follows from Lemma 9.4 that phys operators yield zero when acting
|

on one-particle states. Renorm operators transform one-particle states to one-particle
states. Therefore, we can write

A similar derivation can be performed for the one-photon state and the vacuum vector.
So, the scattering in these states is determined by the renorm part of F . We know
from Table 9.2 that the t-integral F ren
is inﬁnite, even if all terms in F ren are ﬁnite.
Therefore, the action of the S-operator on 0- and 1-particle states leads to inﬁnite
results. The S-operator relates to directly measurable properties, so its divergence is
rather disturbing, and in a ﬁnite theory we must require that

| {z }

Therefore, operator F

must be purely phys.

(11.43)

Equations (11.42) and (11.43) can be also understood from the physical meaning of
the S-operator. The interacting time evolution from the distant past to the distant
future can be written as (see eq. (8.73))

(11.46)

Equations (11.44) - (11.46) are equivalent to (11.42) - (11.43). We formulate these
results in the following

•

Statement U [mass renormalization condition]: There should be no scattering
in vacuum and one-particle states.

In other words, scattering is expected to occur only when there are at least two particles
which interact with each other. One particle has nothing to interact with, and nothing
can happen in the no-particle vacuum state. Let us see if this simple property is
satisﬁed in our model theory. In this theory, V2(t) = 0 and the 2nd order term F2 =

2¯h2 [V1(t), V1(t)] (see eq. (11.29)) has a renorm contribution

This term is non-zero, and, up to a constant factor, it is equal to the one shown in the
diagram 9.3(g). Similar renorm terms appear also in higher orders of the model theory.
Therefore, it is clear that Statement U is not satisﬁed in our model theory, and we
must conclude that the theory is not acceptable. It should be changed or renormalized
to comply with the Statement U.

One possible way to eliminate renorm terms from F , could be to formulate certain
subtraction rules for calculating scattering amplitudes (see, e.g., [80]), so that unwanted
contributions to F are deleted from formula (8.80) in each order of the perturbation
theory. This would be OK if our only goal were to obtain the matrix elements of
the S-matrix and scattering cross sections. However, in the ﬁnal theory we would
like to keep the connection between the Hamiltonian and the S-operator given by
eqs (8.79) and (8.80), therefore, we will prefer another (equivalent) way to do the
renormalization: We will modify the Hamiltonian by adding certain unphys U and
renorm R counterterms to the interaction operator V .7 In other words, we are saying
that the original Hamiltonian

is not correct, and the modiﬁed Hamiltonian with renormalization counterterms

H = H0 + V1

H c = H0 + V c

= H0 + V1 + U + R

better describes the interaction between particles. To comply with the Statement U,
we must choose the counterterms in such a way that operator

F c(t) =

V c(t) +

1
¯h

i
2¯h2 [V c(t), V c(t)] + . . .

does not contain renorm terms. From Table 9.2, it is clear that renorm terms in F c may
appear due to the presence of renorm and unphys terms in V c and their commutators.
So, in order to satisfy eq. (11.42), the counterterms U and R must have such a balance

7It appears that in our model theory the renormalization is achieved by unphys and renorm coun-

terterms only. In the general case, e.g., in QED, phys counterterms should be added as well.

302

CHAPTER 11. QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS

that all renorm terms in F c cancel out in all orders of the perturbation theory. The
procedure of ﬁnding such U and R is called mass renormalization.

In the rest of this section, it will be convenient (the formulas are more compact)
to work with operator Σ(t) (see eq. (8.78)) rather than with F (t). It is not diﬃcult
to show, e.g., using eqs. (8.81) and (8.82), that renormalization of Σ(t) is equivalent
to the removal of renorm terms from the operator F (t). Let us now try to modify the
Hamiltonian of our model theory by adding Hermitian counterterms8 R2, U3(t), R4, . . .

H(t)

H c(t) = H0 + V c(t)

→

= H0 + V1(t) + R2 + U3(t) + R4 + . . . ,

so that renorm terms are eliminated from the scattering operator Σc(t)

We obtain formulas for Σc

counterterms.

Now we go order-by-order and choose counterterms R2, U3(t), R4, . . . so that renorm
terms are eliminated from the left hand sides of eqs (11.47) - (11.50). The ﬁrst-order
term (11.47) is unphys, so there is no need for renormalization in the ﬁrst order. To

Just as we did in the 2nd order, we can choose a renorm counterterm R4 which simply
cancels all renorm terms which may be present in ﬁrst three terms on the right hand
side of (11.53). Formulas for these terms are rather complicated, and we are not going
to present them here. With the above choices, the operator Σc(t) does not contain
renorm terms up to the 4th order, as required by the mass renormalization condition.

If we are interested in
the behavior of a diagram on the energy shell, and the diagram has a box surrounding a subset of
vertices, then one can obtain an equivalent diagram by (i) erasing this box, (ii) drawing another box
surrounding the complement of the subset of vertices, and (iii) change the total sign of the diagram.

diﬀers from (V1(t)V1(t))p+u by the absence of the big box around all vertices and by
moving the small box to another vertex.

Here we are interested only in the electron-electron scattering described by opera-

tors a†a†aa. Therefore, when calculating the product

1
¯h4 (V1(t)V1(t))p+u(V1(t)V1(t))p+u
we need to consider only three terms from (11.58) and three terms from (11.56) as
shown in Fig. 11.2. The result of this calculation is shown in Fig. 11.3. The calculation
of the second term in σ4(t)

By putting Fig. 11.3 and Fig. 11.4 together we can make some simpliﬁcations.
First, consider the terms (a) and (b) in Fig. 11.3 and the term (e) in Fig. 11.4. These
three diagrams have the same topology. The only diﬀerence is in energy denominators.
Let us denote the energy functions of the four vertices in the diagram 11.4(e) by A,
C. Then the sum of the three diagrams is proportional to

A, C, and

−

Therefore diagrams of this type do not contribute to σ4(t)

. Similarly, we can show

that diagrams (c) and (d) in Fig. 11.3 and the diagram (d) in Fig. 11.4 cancel each
other. Next consider two diagrams (e) and (f) in Fig. 11.3 which also have the same
topology. The sum of these diagrams is proportional to

i.e., is equal to the diagram 11.3(b). Similarly, the sum of diagrams 11.3(g) and 11.3(h)
is equal to the diagram 11.3(a). We can also simplify the sum of diagrams 11.3(m)
and 11.3(n). Using the notation for energy functions shown in Fig. 11.3(m) we obtain
that this sum is proportional to

Finally, σ4(t) is represented by 7 diagrams shown in Fig. 11.5. Let us ﬁrst discuss
the contribution of diagrams 11.5(a) - 11.5(b) to the coeﬃcient function D for the
electron-electron scattering on the energy shell. Using diagram rules from subsection

electron-electron scattering at large distances. From classical physics we also know
that electron-electron interactions at large distances and low energies depend on e2 (in
our language they are of second perturbation order) and they are accurately described
by the 2nd order term (9.84). We should require the low energy limit of our theory
to be consistent with classical predictions well established in experiment. So, we will
postulate that in orders higher that 2nd, singular coeﬃcient functions like (11.59)
should not be present at all, whether they are inﬁnite or ﬁnite.

11.3.5 Renormalization in QED.

The renormalization steps outlined in subsections 11.3.2 - 11.3.4 can be repeated,
though with greater computational eﬀorts, in QED. The renormalization theory was
developed by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga in the late 1940’s. Our interpreta-
tion of their approach is simple: the original Hamiltonian H of QED (11.4) - (11.7)
is wrong, and we need to add inﬁnite renormalization corrections (counterterms) to
enforce Statement U and Postulate V and obtain a better Hamiltonian H c. These
steps are suﬃcient for elimination of renorm terms and cancelation of ultraviolet di-
vergences in the S-operator in all perturbation orders. Similar renormalization steps
Kc. However, here we
should be repeated for the interacting boost operators K
have a problem. How we can be sure that addition of renormalization counterterms
to H and K does not destroy the important property of relativistic invariance (i.e.,
the commutation relations (8.17) - (8.21))? Although, we do not have a prescription
for renormalization in boosts, there is an argument that strongly suggests that such
a renormalization is possible and that the relativistic invariance is preserved in the
renormalized theory.10 To explain this argument, let us look at the renormalization
program from a diﬀerent perspective.

→

The QED Hamiltonian given by eq. (9.34), (11.4) - (11.7) depends on three pa-

rameters: the electron mass m, the proton mass M, and the electron charge e:

H(m, M, e) = H0(m, M) + V1(m, M, e) + V2(m, M, e)

(11.61)

A remarkable property of QED is that this theory is renormalizable [41]. The renor-
malizability means that the addition of renormalization counterterms is equivalent to
simply modifying the values of parameters m, M, and e.11 In other words, after adding
unphys U, renorm R, and phys P counterterms in all orders of the perturbation theory,
the QED Hamiltonian H c acquires the same functional form as the original Hamilto-
nian H in (11.61) but with renormalized (inﬁnite) masses ˜m, ˜M and the renormalized
(inﬁnite) charge ˜e12

10Another way of proving the relativistic invariance of the renormalized theory is to perform reg-
ularization by introducing Lorentz-invariant cutoﬀ factors in coeﬃcient functions of interactions.
Then, the regularized theory becomes non-local, but still satisﬁes the Poincar´e commutation rela-
In this case, the introduction of counterterms preserves the relativistic invariance.
tions [75, 76].

11From this point of view the mass renormalization counterterms were discussed in refs. [81].
12This also means that renormalization counterterms in each order have the same operator struc-
ture as terms H0, V1, and V2 in the original Hamiltonian (11.61). Then the coeﬃcients in these
counterterms can be unambiguously ﬁxed by physically transparent conditions (Statement U and
Postulate V ). In non-renormalizable theories, the number of diﬀerent types of counterterms and their
complexity grows with increasing perturbation order, and the divergences in the S-operator cannot
be eliminated by adjusting a ﬁnite number of physically relevant parameters.

11.3. RENORMALIZATION.

309

H c = H(m, M, e) + U + R + P

(11.62)

= H( ˜m, ˜M , ˜e)

Since the renormalization amounts simply to modifying the parameters in the Hamil-
tonian, it cannot change the relativistic invariance of the theory in any way.

RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM
DYNAMICS

The ﬁrst principle is that you must not fool
yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.
Richard Feynman

In what follows we will refer to the renormalized theory with the Hamiltonian H c
(11.62) as to QED. Its great successes are well known. Just a few lowest orders in the
perturbation expansion of the S-operator (8.76) with the Hamiltonian H c are suﬃcient
to obtain scattering cross sections, the electron’s magnetic moment, and energies of
bound states (e.g., Lamb shifts in atoms) in remarkable agreement with experiment.

However, this success was achieved by introducing an extremely weird property
of the theory: the masses and charges of particles are inﬁnite and the Hamiltonian
H c is inﬁnite as well. In section 12.1 (see also ref.
[13]) we will analyze these seri-
ous theoretical problems characteristic for QED. In particular, we will focus on the
ultraviolet divergences present in the Hamiltonian H c and on the non-physical virtual
particles plaguing the theory. We are going to demonstrate that the formalism of QED
can be signiﬁcantly improved, the ultraviolet divergences removed from the Hamilto-
nian, and the idea of non-observable virtual particles abandoned.
In particular, we
will ﬁnd a ﬁnite ”dressed particle” Hamiltonian H d which provides not just accurate
scattering operator (as in QED) but also a good description of the time evolution
and bound states. We call this approach the relativistic quantum dynamics because,
unlike traditional quantum ﬁeld theory concerned with calculations of the S-matrix,
RQD emphasizes the dynamical, i.e., time-dependent nature of interacting processes.
In section 12.2 we will discuss applications of RQD to the simplest quantum me-
chanical problem - the structure of the hydrogen atom. We will derive the interaction

317

318

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

between dressed electrons and protons in the lowest 2nd perturbation order and demon-
strate how well-known ﬁne and hyperﬁne atomic level structures can be calculated. We
will also discuss the extension of this approach to higher perturbation orders and the
general structure of interactions in RQD which involves creation and annihilation of
particles.

In section 12.3 we will turn our attention to the interaction term Zd in the boost
operator. We will ﬁnd that the dynamical character of boosts ha far reaching implica-
tions for our understanding of space, time, and relativity. In particular, we will argue
that universal linear Lorentz transformations of observables (positions, momenta, etc.)
are no longer valid if the observed system involves interactions. This will lead us to the
conclusion (see also subsections 1.2.2 and 2.3.3) that the Minkowski spacetime concept
is an approximate description of reality. In subsection 12.3.5 we will ﬁnd that elec-
tromagnetic interactions between charged particles propagate instantaneously. This
prediction of RQD may explain the superluminal propagation of evanescent waves
observed in experiments (see subsection 12.3.6).

12.1 Dressed particle approach

±

The traditional approach to QED accepts that inﬁnities in the Hamiltonian H c (11.62)
have real physical meaning. The common view is that electrons and protons really have
inﬁnite masses ˜m and ˜M , and “bare” charges
˜e. However, the “bare” particles with
inﬁnite masses and charges were never observed in nature. They do not correspond to
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H c. The traditional approach alleges that observable
particles are described by eigenstates of H c which are complex linear combinations
of multiparticle “bare” states. These linear combinations do have correct measurable
masses m and M and charges
e. This situation is often described as “bare” particles
being surrounded by “coats” of virtual particles, thus forming dressed particles. The
“coat” modiﬁes the mass of the “bare” particle by an inﬁnite amount, so that the
resulting mass is exactly the one measured in experiments. The coat also shields the
real (inﬁnite) charge of the bare particle, so that the charge of the dressed particle
becomes

±

e.

±

12.1.1 QED is unable to describe time evolution

In addition to peculiar inﬁnite masses and charges of “bare” particles, traditional QED
predicts rather complex structure and dynamics of the “physical” vacuum. For exam-
ple, the time evolution of the “bare” (no-particle) vacuum vector in the Schr¨odinger
representation is rather non-trivial

Even if we forget for a moment that interaction terms in H c are inﬁnite, we see that
various multiparticle states are created from the vacuum during time evolution. These
states do not obey the energy conservation law, but if they live a short time ∆t, the
amount ∆E
¯h/∆t by which the energy conservation law may be violated can exceed
the energy required for creation of photons, or electron-positron or proton-antiproton
pairs.1 So, at intermediate times the vacuum is full of appearing and disappearing
virtual particles. The “physical” vacuum in QED is not just an empty state without
particles. It is more like a boiling “soup” of particles, antiparticles, and photons.

≈

Needless to say that virtual particles have not been seen in experiments. Even if
we accept this weird description of physical reality, it is clear that the renormalization
program did not solve the problem of ultraviolet divergences in quantum ﬁeld the-
ory. The divergences were removed from the S-operator, but they reappeared in the
Hamiltonian in the form of inﬁnite counterterms, and this approach just shifted the
problem of inﬁnities from one place to another. In QED, there is no well-deﬁned ﬁnite
Hamiltonian, and, therefore, there is no well-deﬁned time evolution operator. Luckily
for QED, current experiments with elementary particles are not capable of measuring
the time dependent dynamics. They are, basically, limited to measurements of scat-
tering cross-sections and energies of bound states.2 In this situation, the inability of
the theory to describe the time evolution can be tolerated. But there is no doubt that
time-dependent processes in high energy physics will be eventually accessible to more
advanced experimental techniques. Clearly, without description of time evolution, we
cannot claim a success in developing a comprehensive theory of subatomic phenomena.
The mathematical inconsistencies of the renormalization approach concerned many

prominent scientists, such as Dirac and Landau. As Rohrlich wrote [84]

Thus, present quantum electrodynamics is one of the strangest achievements
of the human mind. No theory has been conﬁrmed by experiment to higher
precision; and no theory has been plagued by greater mathematical diﬃ-
culties which have withstood repeated attempts at their elimination. There

1In scattering theory we consider the evolution in the inﬁnite time interval ∆t, the allowed non-
conservation of energy ∆E is zero, and all such virtual processes get eliminated from the S-operator.
This is expressed by the energy delta function in (11.39).

2Time dynamics can be resolved in processes involving low energy transitions, e.g., Rydberg states
of atoms [82]. However, the experimental resolution is not yet suﬃcient to detect the eﬀects of small
radiative corrections. So, applications of non-relativistic or heuristic Dirac-Fock Hamiltonians [83]
can be quite successful in such situations. Another experimental manifestation of time-dependent
processes (decays) is discussed in chapter 13.

320

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

can be no doubt that the present agreement with experiments is not for-
tuitous. Nevertheless, the renormalization procedure can only be regarded
as a temporary crutch which holds up the present framework. It should be
noted that, even if the renormalization constants were not inﬁnite, the the-
ory would still be unsatisfactory, as long as the unphysical concept of ”bare
particle” plays a dominant role.

12.1.2 Main idea of the dressed particle approach

Let us brieﬂy recall the logic which led us from the original (before renormalization)
interaction Hamiltonian V of QED (11.32) and (11.38) to the interaction with coun-
terterms V c = V + U + R + P (see eq. (11.62)). There are two major diﬃculties
with the interaction V . First, the coeﬃcient functions of terms in V do not tend to
zero suﬃciently rapidly as their arguments go to inﬁnity. Therefore, as discussed in
subsection 9.3.7, loop integrals encountered in calculations of the S-operator (8.80)
are divergent. Second, this interaction contains unphys terms. It is clear from Table
9.2 that commutators of such terms in (8.80) give rise to renorm terms in F . The
reconciliation of this property with the absence of renorm terms in F (required by the
Statement U and eq. (11.42)) forced us to change the interaction by introducing inﬁ-
nite counterterms in H c in section 11.3, so that F ren = 0. As discussed in subsection
11.3.4, the counterterms should be further adjusted to ensure the numerical agreement
between the theory and experiment, e.g., the validity of the Postulate V . This is the
idea (somewhat paraphrased) of the renormalization approach developed by Feynman,
Schwinger, and Tomonaga in the late 1940’s.

The position taken in this book is that the renormalization program is just a ﬁrst
step in the process of elimination of inﬁnities from quantum ﬁeld theory. The presence
of inﬁnite counterterms in the Hamiltonian of QED H c is not acceptable.
In this
section we are going to propose how to make the second step in this direction: remove
inﬁnite contributions from the Hamiltonian H c and completely solve the paradox of
ultraviolet divergences in QED.

Our solution is based on the dressed particle approach which has a long history.
Initial ideas about “asymptotically stationary states” were expressed by van Hove [85].
First clear formulation of the dressed particle concept and its application to model
QFT theories are contained in a brilliant paper by Greenberg and Schweber [8]. This
formalism was further applied to various quantum ﬁeld theories including scalar-ﬁeld
model [86], Lee model [87], and Ruijgrok-Van Hove model [9, 88]. The way to construct
the dressed particle Hamiltonian as a perturbation series in a general QFT theory was
suggested by Faddeev [89] (see also [90, 91]). Shirokov with coworkers [10, 92] further
developed these ideas and, in particular, demonstrated how the ultraviolet divergences
can be removed from the Hamiltonian of QFT up to the 4th order (see also [93]).

The physical idea underlying the dressed particle approach can be derived from the

12.1. DRESSED PARTICLE APPROACH

321

following observation. Our Statement U (see subsection 11.3.2) declares that nothing
happens in the vacuum and one-particle states if dynamics is integrated over inﬁnite
time interval, i.e., the S-operator is equal to unity in these sectors of the Fock space.
However, nobody has ever observed even temporary creation of virtual particles out
of vacuum or one-particle states.3 Then it seems appropriate to generalize Statement
U and assume that vacuum is just a state without particles, and that single particles
remain single all the time: they just freely move in space in exact accordance with
laws derived in chapter 7.

•

Postulate W [Stability of vacuum and one-particle states]: There is no in-
teraction in the vacuum and one-particle states, i.e., the time evolution of these
states is governed by the non-interacting Hamiltonian.4

Equation (12.1) demonstrates that in QED with Hamiltonian H c this simple picture
is not true at intermediate times. This is the main problem of the QED Hamiltonian.
Therefore, we claim that the Hamiltonian H c of QED is still not correct, and we will
try to ﬁnd a better ﬁnite Hamiltonian (referred to as the dressed particle Hamiltonian
and denoted H d), so that in agreement with Postulate W its interaction part V d yields
zero when acting on the vacuum and one-particle states.5 According to Lemma 9.4
this means that the interaction V d must be phys.6

V d = (V d)ph

(12.2)

Since phys interactions act only on states with two or more particles, in the dressed
particle theory there are no clouds of virtual particles and no self-interaction eﬀects
in vacuum and one-particle states when interaction V d is used. Of course, the mod-
iﬁcation of the Hamiltonian H c cannot be done arbitrarily. We want to keep all the
good properties achieved so far, like the relativistic invariance, cluster separability, and
accurate description of scattering amplitudes and energies of bound states. In other
words, we want to prove that there exists a Hamiltonian H d = H0 + V d such that

3There are various observable eﬀects that are usually attributed to the virtual particles, like in-
creased strength of the electromagnetic interaction at large values of transferred momentum [94]. We
believe that these eﬀects can be explained without resorting to virtual particles.

4Actually, it is more appropriate to say that interaction eﬀects in one-particle states are limited
to oscillations and decays. Although, these eﬀects are absent in QED, they are quite common in the
presence of weak and strong interactions. We will discuss particle decay in chapter 13.

5A diﬀerent but mathematically equivalent approach to dressing will be discussed in subsection

12.1.10.

6Note that for such phys interactions, the Statement U and the property (11.43) follow auto-
matically because commutators and time integrals of phys operators in (8.80) are phys (see Table
9.2).

Next we introduce regularization, e.g., a cutoﬀ at large integration momenta Λ (see
subsection 11.3.1) which ensures that all interactions V c
in the Hamiltonian of QED are
i
ﬁnite,8 and that all loop integrals involved in calculations of products and commutators
of interactions V c
i are convergent. First, we are going to prove that in this regulated
theory the operator Φ can be chosen so that conditions (A) - (F) are satisﬁed in

= 0 and related

regularization preserves the relativistic invariance of the Hamiltonian H c, however, such a preservation
is possible with appropriate choice of cutoﬀ factors, as discussed in the footnote on page 308.

Now we need to solve these equations order-by-order. This means that we need to

Now we can prove that eq. (12.21) is satisﬁed automatically. First note that with the

(12.25)

the operator Φ1(t) + Φ2(t) is smooth, bounded,12 and satisﬁes condition (12.5). There-

2 (t) agrees with the

1 (t) is non-singular and does not have energy shell.
Thus both terms in commutators in (12.22) and (12.23) are connected, and by Theorems 9.8 and 9.9,
the commutators themselves are connected and non-singular. The outer t-integrations in (12.22) and
(12.23) do not introduce singularities, because the integrand in (12.22) does not have energy shell,
and the integrand in (12.23) is zero on the energy shell.

The term [V c

satisﬁed in the i-th order.

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

12.1.8 General properties of dressed particle interactions.

One may notice that even after conditions (I) - (IV) are satisﬁed for functions ζi, there
is a great deal of ambiguity in choosing their behavior outside the energy shell. There-
fore, the dressing transformation is not unique, and there is an inﬁnite set of dressed
particle Hamiltonians that satisfy our requirements (A) - (F). However, there are some
common properties of these Hamiltonians which are important for applications.
In
most processes (excluding very short virtual events) the total energy is approximately
conserved at all times. For description of such processes it is suﬃcient to know the
interaction only near the energy shell where we can approximately set ζi ≈
1. This
observation immediately allows us to obtain a good approximation for the second-order
interaction from eq. (12.24)

(12.37)

Some examples of potentials present in V d
2 are shown in Table 12.1. We can classify
them into two groups: elastic potentials and inelastic potentials. Elastic potentials
do not change the particle content of the system. Their operators have equal number
of annihilation and creation operators, as if they create and then annihilate the same
numbers and types of particles. As shown in subsection 9.2.7, elastic potentials corre-
spond to particle interactions familiar from ordinary quantum mechanics and classical
physics.15 Inelastic potentials change the number and/or types of particles. Among
2nd order inelastic potentials in RQD there are potentials for pair creation, annihila-
tion, and pair conversion (see Table 12.1).

Similarly to the 2nd order discussed above, the third-order interaction V d

3 can be
explicitly obtained near the energy shell by setting ζ3 ≈
1. All 3rd order potentials are
inelastic. Two of them are shown in Table 12.1: The term d†a†c†da (bremsstrahlung)
describes creation of a photon in a proton-electron electron collision. In the language
of classical electrodynamics, this can be interpreted as radiation due to acceleration
during interaction of charged particles and is referred to as the radiation reaction force.
The Hermitian-conjugated term d†a†dac describes absorption of a photon by a colliding
pair of charged particles.

The situation is less certain for the 4th and higher order dressed particle interac-

tions. Near the energy shell we can again set ξ4 ≈

1 and write (from eq. (12.34))

The contribution ¯h(F c
is not true for the contribution i
2 ]. This commutator depends on the behavior
of V d
2 everywhere in the momentum space. So, it depends on our choice of ζ2 outside
the energy shell. The function ζ2 satisﬁes conditions (I) - (IV), but still there is a great
freedom which is reﬂected in the uncertainty of V d
4 even on the energy shell. Therefore,
we have two possibilities depending on the operator structure of the 4th order potential
we are interested in.

First, there are potentials contained only in the term (F c

4 )ph. For example, the
2 ]ph does not contain the contribution a†a†a†b†aa responsible for
commutator [V d
the creation of an electron-positron pair in two-electron collisions. For such potentials,
their 4th order expression near the energy shell can be explicitly obtained from formula
(12.38).

16Recall that exact knowledge of the S-operator Sc in all perturbation orders is assumed in our

approach. Therefore, the operator F c

4 is known near the energy shell.

330

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

Second, there are potentials V d

4 whose contributions come from both two terms on
the right hand side of eq. (12.38). For such potentials, the second term on the right
hand side of (12.38) remains uncertain. One example is the electron-proton interaction
d†a†da. The primary experimental manifestation of the 4th order contribution in the
d†a†da potential is in the Lamb shifts of the hydrogen energy spectrum (see subsection
12.2.4). Note that the uncertainty in V d
4 should not aﬀect the calculated energies of
atomic levels. They are the same as in QED, because Hamiltonians H c and H d are
related to each other by an unitary transformation. However, the 4th order correction
to the shape of atomic wavefunctions does depend on the choice of ζ2. It is interesting
to note that although the oﬀ-energy-shell behavior of the 2nd order potential and the
on-shell behavior of the 4th order potential cannot be separately determined in our
theory, they are connected to each other in such a way that the ambiguity of the
potential does not aﬀect the S-matrix for the electron-proton scattering or energies of
bound states in the hydrogen atom.

We see that in higher perturbation orders there are more and more terms in the
interaction operator with increasing complexity. In contrast to the QED Hamiltonian
H c, there seems to be no way to write H d in a closed form. However, to the credit of
RQD, all these high order terms directly reﬂect real interactions and processes observ-
able in nature. The above construction does not allow us to obtain full information
about V d: The oﬀ-shell behavior of potentials is almost completely arbitrary, and
the on-shell behavior can be determined only for lowest order terms.17 However, this
uncertainty is perfectly understandable: It simply reﬂects the one-to-many correspon-
dence between the S-operator and Hamiltonians (see subsection 8.4.4). It means that
all of which can be used for S-matrix
there is a class of ﬁnite phys interactions
{
calculations without encountering divergent integrals. Then which member of the class
is the unique correct interaction Hamiltonian V d capable of describing the time
V d
{
evolution of interacting particles? As we are not aware of any theoretical condition
allowing to determine the oﬀ-energy-shell behavior of ζi, this question should be de-
ferred to the experiment. There seems to be no other way but to ﬁt functions ζi to
experimental measurements. Such experiments are bound to be rather challenging be-
cause they must go beyond usual information contained in the S-operator (scattering
cross-sections, energies and lifetimes of bound states, etc.) and should be capable of
measuring radiative corrections to the wave functions and time evolution of observables
in the region of interaction. Current experiments do not have suﬃcient resolution to
meet this challenge.

12.1.9 Relativistic invariance of the dressed particle approach.

The next question is whether the theory with the Hamiltonian H d is relativistically
invariant? In other words, whether there exists such a boost operator Kd that the
set of generators
satisﬁes Poincar´e commutators? With the unitary
dressing operator exp(iΦ) constructed above this problem has a simple solution. If we
deﬁne Kd = eiΦKce−
iΦ, then we can obtain a full set of dressed generators via unitary
transformation of the old generators18

{
The dressing transformation eiΦ is unitary and, therefore, preserves commutators.
Since old operators obey the Poincar´e commutators, the same is true for the new
generators. This proves that the transformed theory is relativistically invariant and
belongs to the instant form of dynamics [95].

}

12.1.10 Comparison with other dressed particle approaches

In this subsection, we would like to discuss two philosophically diﬀerent but math-
ematically equivalent points of view on the dressing transformation. The alternative
approach to dressing is exempliﬁed by the works of Shirokov and coauthors [92]. In con-
trast to our approach, they kept the Hamiltonian H c intact, but applied the (inverse)
dressing transformation to the creation and annihilation operators of particles.

id = e−
Physically, this means that instead of “bare” particles (created and annihilated by
α† and α, respectively) the theory is formulated in terms of fully dressed particles,
i.e.. particles together with their virtual clouds. Then the Hamiltonian H c must be
expressed as a function of the new particle operators H c =
(α†d, αd). Apparently,
expresses the Hamiltonian H d of our approach through “bare”
the same function
particle operators: H d =

(α†, α). Indeed, from eq. (12.3) we can write

So, mathematically, these two approaches are equivalent. Let us demonstrate this

The physical predictions of both theories, e.g., expectation values of observables (12.40)

working with only one kind of particles, i.e., those observed in experiments.

12.2. COULOMB POTENTIAL AND BEYOND.

333

12.2 Coulomb potential and beyond.

In previous section we obtained formulas for the QED Hamiltonian20 H d in a rather
abstract form.21 In this section we would like to demonstrate how this Hamiltonian can
be cast into the form suitable for calculations, i.e., expressed through particle creation
and annihilation operators. We will focus on the interaction between charged particles
(electron and proton) in the lowest (second) order of the perturbation theory in the
2 approximation. As a result of our calculations we will obtain the interaction com-
c−
monly known as the Breit potential. The major part of the Breit potential is the usual
Coulomb potential. In addition, there are relativistic corrections responsible for mag-
netic, contact, spin-orbit, spin-spin and other interactions which are routinely used in
relativistic calculations of atomic and molecular systems. This derivation demonstrates
how formulas familiar from ordinary quantum mechanics and classical electrodynamics
naturally follow from approximations in RQD. The application of the Hamiltonian H d
to the hydrogen atom is brieﬂy discussed in subsection 12.2.4. This analysis supports
the ability of the dressed particle approach to provide a rigorous treatment of bound
states and reinforces our conviction that V d is the correct interaction between charged
particles.

12.2.1 Breit Hamiltonian

(second) order of the perturbation theory. The interaction operator near the energy

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

We will focus on the electron-proton interaction term d†a†da as it is responsible for
the binding in the hydrogen atom, which will be our topic in subsection 12.2.4. Then
we can set t = 0, extract from (12.42) the terms of the type d†a†da, use notation from
section 11.2 (see, in particular, eq. (11.25) - (11.25), (11.36), and (11.38)), and obtain

Electron-proton interaction at low energies.

Operator (12.43) has non-trivial action in all sectors of the Fock space which contain at
least one electron and one proton. However, for simplicity, we will limit our attention
to the “1 proton + 1 electron” subspace
Hpe in the Fock space. According to discussion
in subsection 9.2.7, if Ψ(p, π; e, ǫ) is a wave function of a two-particle state, then the
interaction Hamiltonian (12.43) will transform it to (see eq. (9.68))

(9.69)), we must replace variables p and e there with diﬀerential operators ˆp = i¯hd/dx

12.2.4 The hydrogen atom

Now we can apply the Hamiltonian (12.50) to describe the system of two charged par-
ticles - the proton and electron. We can use the fact that this Hamiltonian commutes
with the operator of total momentum P = p + e. Therefore the interaction in (12.50)
leaves invariant the subspace of

Hpe with zero total momentum

This means that we can set ˆq =
operator of diﬀerentiation with respect to r

−

ˆe = ˆp in eq. (12.52) and (12.54) and consider ˆq as

P = p + e = 0

ˆq = i¯h

∂
∂r

If we make these substitutions in the Hamiltonian (12.50), then the energies ε and wave
functions Ψε(r, π, ǫ) of stationary states of the hydrogen atom at rest can be found as
solutions of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation

H(i¯h

, r, Sel, Spr)Ψε(r) = εΨε(r)

(12.56)

∂
∂r

Analytical solution of eq.
(12.56) is not possible. Realistically, one can ﬁrst solve
equation (12.56) having just the Coulomb interaction term (12.51) there. This is the
familiar non-relativistic problem which has analytic solutions [96]. We can consider
these solutions as zero-order approximations for energies ε and wave functions Ψε(r).
Then other interaction terms in (12.50) can be treated as perturbations which in the
ﬁrst approximation do not aﬀect the wave functions but shift energies. Then Vorbit and
Vspin
orbit are responsible for the ﬁne structure of the hydrogen atom, and Vspin
spin is
responsible for the hyperﬁne structure (see Fig. 12.1).

−

−

The derivation of these potentials in QED is not new. The Breit interaction was
obtained by ﬁtting to the second-order S-operator in
83 of ref. [80]. The important
§
diﬀerence of our approach is that we propose a rigorous generalization of this procedure
to potentials of any kind (both preserving and changing the number of particles) in
any order of the perturbation theory (see section 12.1).

In addition, to the 2nd order electron-proton interaction, there are, of course, higher
order radiative corrections. The largest correction comes from the 4th order contri-
bution V d
4 [d†a†da]. which is responsible for the Lamb shifts of atomic energies. As
discussed in section 12.1, although the energy shifts are available from QED, the cor-
rections to the wave functions remain undetermined due to the uncertainty in the

behavior of V d
2 outside the energy shell. So, these corrections must be found from ex-
periment. The readily available measurements of atomic energies and scattering data
are useless for determining the oﬀ-shell behavior of V d
4 on the energy shell. We
must rely on observations of the non-stationary dynamics of atomic states. However
time-resolved studies of such processes with a resolution suﬃcient for extracting small
radiative corrections is a challenging experimental task.

2 and V d

So far we discussed the action of operators d†a†da in the Hilbert space of the hy-
drogen atom. The sector
Hpe was invariant with respect to this interaction, so the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors could be found by the diagonalization of such a truncated
Hamiltonian. However, there are other terms playing a role as well. The most signif-
icant are the bremsstrahlung potentials d†a†dac and d†a†c†da in the 3rd order of the
perturbation theory (see Table 12.1). The bremsstrahlung terms are responsible for
light absorption and spontaneous light emission by the atom. The two-particle sub-
Hpe is not invariant with respect to these potentials. For example, operators
space
d†a†dac and d†a†c†da have non-zero matrix elements between stationary states 2P 1/2
and 1S1/2 + γ. The expression

provides an amplitude for the process in which a photon (with energy close to ε2P 1/2

ε1S1/2) is absorbed by the ground state 1S1/2 of the hydrogen atom, and the excited
state 2P 1/2 is created. The expression

describes an amplitude for the process in which a photon is spontaneously emitted
from the excited atomic state 2P 1/2. The terms like d†a†c†da in V d, rather than ”zero-
point vibrations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld”, are responsible for the instability and
broadening of excited atomic levels. The issues related to the time evolution of such
metastable states are discussed in chapter 13).

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

12.3 Discussion

In this section we will summarize and discuss important results obtained in this book
regarding charged particles and their interactions. Further conﬁrmation of our main
conclusions (e.g., the dynamical character of boosts) will come from the consideration
of particle decays in the next chapter.

12.3.1

Interaction of dressed particles

Let us now review the process by which we arrived to the ﬁnite dressed particle Hamil-
tonian H d = H0 + V d in RQD (see Fig. 12.2). We started with the QED Hamiltonian
H = H0 + V (11.4) in subsection 11.1.3 (the upper left box in Fig. 12.2) and demon-
strated some of its good properties, such as the relativistic invariance and the cluster
separability. However, when we tried to calculate the S-operator from this Hamil-
tonian (arrow (1) in Fig. 12.2) we obtained meaningless inﬁnite results beyond the
lowest non-vanishing order of perturbation theory (see discussion in subsections 9.3.7
and 11.3.2). The solution to this problem was given by the renormalization theory22 in
section 11.3 (arrow (2)): inﬁnite counterterms were added to the Hamiltonian H and
a new Hamiltonian was obtained H c = H0 + V c. Although the Hamiltonian H c is inﬁ-
nite, these inﬁnities cancel in the process of calculation of the S-operator (broken arrow
(3)) and very accurate values for observable scattering cross-sections and energies of
bound states are obtained (arrow (4)). As a result of the renormalization procedure,
the divergences are “swept under the rug”, and this rug is the Hamiltonian H c. This
Hamiltonian is not satisfactory: First, in the limit of inﬁnite cutoﬀ the matrix elements
of the Hamiltonian H c on bare particle states are inﬁnite. Second, the Hamiltonian H c
contains unphys termslike a†b†c† and a†c†a which imply that in the course of time evo-
lution the vacuum state and one-electron states rapidly dissociate into complex linear
combinations of multiparticle states.23 This behavior is clearly unphysical. Therefore,
H c cannot be used to describe the dynamics of interacting particles. To solve this
problem, we applied a unitary dressing transformation to the Hamiltonian H c (arrow
(5)) and obtained a new dressed particle Hamiltonian24

H d = eiΦH ce−

iΦ

We managed to select inﬁnite terms in Φ in such a way that all inﬁnities from H c are
canceled out, that the relativistic invariance and cluster separability of the theory with

22This theory was ﬁrst introduced by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga in the late 1940’s.
23Although the ﬁrst mentioned problem can be ﬁxed by the “similarity renormalization” approach

[11], the second problem persists in all current formulations of QED that do not use dressing.

24Our approach has swept the divergences under another rug. This time the rug is the phase Φ
of the transformation operator eiΦ. This operator has no physical meaning, so there is no harm in
choosing it inﬁnite.

the Hamiltonian H d remain intact, and that H d leads to exactly the same accurate
S-operator as H c (arrow (6)).25

This discussion alows us to formulate important diﬀerences and similarities between
three theories: general quantum ﬁeld theory, ordinary quantum mechanics, and RQD.
All three theories can be formulated in the same Fock space. The diﬀerence between
them is in the allowed form of the Hamiltonian. The general QFT does not impose
any restrictions on the interaction. This can be any combination of terms (9.51). As
discussed in subsection 11.3.2, the presence of unphys and renorm terms in the interac-
tion operator results in self-interaction problems and in the need for renormalization.
In ordinary quantum mechanics, the number and types of particles are conserved.
This can be arranged in the Fock space if the interaction contains only terms like
a†a†aa, a†a†a†aaa, a†c†ac, . . ., i.e., those in which each annihilation is matched by the
corresponding creation operator. Then each sector of the Fock space is invariant with
respect to time evolution and other inertial transformations. No renormalization is
needed, however such interactions cannot describe the processes of creation and anni-
hilation of particles evident in experiments.

RQD approach discussed in this chapter is intermediate between too restrictive
quantum mechanics and excessively liberal QFT. In addition to particle-preserving
quantum-mechanical terms, RQD allows phys terms describing creation and annihila-
tion of particles, like a†a†c†aa and a†a†aac. These terms have at least two annihilation
operators, so they yield zero when acting on vacuum and one-particle states. Then
self-interaction eﬀects are absent and the renormalization procedure is not needed.

The Hamiltonian of RQD has a number of advantages over the Hamiltonian of
QED (11.4). Unlike the “trilinear” interactions in (11.6), all terms in H d have very
clear and direct physical meaning and correspond to real observable physical processes
(see Table 12.1.). Moreover, with H d, we can now study the time evolution (arrow
(7)), scattering, bound states, etc. by applying usual rules of quantum mechanics
without regularization, renormalization, and other tricks. Unlike QED, where even
the simplest vacuum and one-particle states can be expressed only as superpositions of
inﬁnite numbers of “bare” states and the discussion of particle dynamics is impossible,
all calculations with the Hamiltonian H d are conceptually not diﬀerent from those in
ordinary non-relativistic quantum mechanics: states can be described by normalized
wave functions, the time development of states and observables is governed by a ﬁnite
well-deﬁned Hamiltonian, the stationary states and their energies can be found by the
diagonalization procedure. The only signiﬁcant diﬀerence from quantum mechanics is
that in RQD the number of particles is not conserved, and one can take into account
the transitions between subspaces of the Fock space with diﬀerent particle numbers.

25This construction was based on the perturbation theory. Therefore, as discussed in subsection
8.4.3, the good properties of the RQD Hamiltonian H d are true only if the perturbations series
converges. The convergence issue remains unresolved in the traditional QED approach, and we haven’t
added anything to its resolution in this book.

12.3. DISCUSSION

345

We have explicit expressions for the electron-proton interaction term in H d in the
2nd perturbation order (see section 12.2). We also have detailed explicit rulesfor deriva-
tion of V d in any desired order (see subsections 12.1.3 - 12.1.7). These calculations,
though straightforward, are rather laborious. They can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed by
using the diagram technique discussed in section 9.3.

renormalization

Looking back at the derivation of the dressed particle Hamiltonian H d one may
wonder if nature was meant to be that complicated? Currently we must rely on the
dubious sequence of steps: “canonical gauge ﬁeld quantization
→
dressing” in order to extract physically meaningful contributions from the original QED
Lagrangian and to obtain the satisfactory H d. Apparently, the “ﬁrst principles” used in
construction of relatyivistic quantum ﬁeld theories (local ﬁelds, gauge invariance, etc.)
are not fundamental. Otherwise, we would not need such a painful procedur, involving
inﬁnities and their cancellations, to derive a satisfactory dressed particle Hamiltonian.
Are renormalization and dressing inevitable ingredients of a realistic physical theory?
Our answer to these questions is “no”. It would be much more preferable to derive
the dressed Hamiltonian H d directly from some general principles. Unfortunately, the
full list of such principles is not known at the moment. We may speculate that the
following principles will survive in the future comprehensive theory:

→

relativistic invariance

instant form of dynamics

cluster separability

•

•

•

•

full dressing (a simple structure of the vacuum and one-particle states)

An important step towards deriving the explicit form of interaction potentials from
these principles was made in ref. [74]. It was shown there that if the structure (topol-
ogy) of interaction terms as products of particle creation and annihilation operators is
given, then the momentum dependence of the coeﬃcient functions can be determined
by solving a set of diﬀerential equations resulting from the commutators of the Poincar´e
group. It would be interesting to apply this approach to quantum electrodynamics in
the dressed particle form.

12.3.2

”No interaction” theorem

With the interacting theory constructed above we can calculate the time evolution of
interacting particles, which in the classical limit (see section 7.3) is described by trajec-
tories. Knowing the operator of boost K d, we can also ﬁnd the boost transformations
of trajectories. Let us discuss these transformations in more detail. In subsection 7.3.7
we demonstrated that trajectory of a free particle transforms under boosts according

346

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

to Lorentz formulas (7.48) and (7.49) which are equivalent to (7.45) - (7.47). If we
have a system of two non-interacting particles, the operators of energy and boost are

H0 = h1 + h2
K0 = k1 + k2

Then the trajectories of the particles in the moving frame of reference are the same as
in eqs (7.45) - (7.47). For example,

Then the space-time coordinates of events (intersections of particle trajectories) in
such a system transform by Lorentz formulas [14]. But this conclusion is not true if
the particles interact with each other. In this case, the generators of time translations
and boosts have additional interaction-dependent terms

does not result in simple formula (12.58), and we cannot guarantee that space-time
coordinates of events transform according to Lorentz. Currie, Jordan, and Sudarshan
analyzed this problem in greater detail [40] and proved the famous “no-interaction
theorem”.

Theorem 12.1. (Currie, Jordan, and Sudarshan) If trajectories of two particles obey
the Lorentz transformation laws (7.50) - (7.56) then the particles do not interact with
each other, i.e., the force acting on each particle is zero26

26Here we consider the classical limit of the theory in which dynamics of particles is described by
trajectories and quantum commutators are substituted by Poisson brackets. In the quantum case the
statement of the theorem remains valid if the word “trajectory” is replaced by “the time dependence
of expectation values of the position and momentum operators”.

The “no-interaction theorem” implies that trajectories (or, in general, expectation
values of quantum operators) of interacting particles do not transform via Lorentz
formulas. This is in clear contradiction with the generally accepted Assertion D (see
subsection 1.2.1). In current literature there are two interpretations of this result. One
interpretation is that the Hamiltonian dynamics cannot properly describe interactions.
Then a variety of non-Hamiltonian versions of dynamics were suggested, in which the
manifest covariance of trajectories is enforced.27 Another view is that variables r and
p do not describe real observables of particle positions and momenta, or even that the
notion of particles themselves becomes irrelevant in quantum ﬁeld theory.

27For review see ref. [60]. Other approaches not mentioned there include [61, 62].

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

In RQD we reject both these explanations. We maintain that the Hamiltonian dy-
namics, i.e., the unitary representation of the Poincar´e group in the Hilbert space of the
system, is the only consistent way to describe inertial transformations of observables,
in particular, the time evolution, in quantum theory. We also regard r and p as true
observables of particle position and momentum, respectively. According to our Postu-
late R in subsection 8.2.3, the interaction in the Hamiltonian must be accompanied by
interaction in the boost operators, which makes transformations of particle trajecto-
ries interaction-dependent and more complicated than those in eq. (12.58). So, from
our point of view, the Theorem 12.1 can be called the “no-Lorentz-transformation”
theorem, rather than the “no-interaction” theorem.

In our approach to relativity, all systems obey the relativistic invariance which we

deﬁne as

(I) Relativistic invariance: Descriptions of the system in diﬀerent reference frames
are related by transformations which furnish a representation of the Poincar´e
group (see Statement O in subsection 5.2.4).

The traditional approach to relativity postulates manifest covariance which is a

particular case of our deﬁnition (I)

(II) Manifest covariance: Descriptions of the system in diﬀerent reference frames
are related by Lorentz (i.e. linear and universal) transformations (see Assertion
F in subsection 1.2.1).

We know that deﬁnition (II) applies to light pulses and to non-interacting particles.28
However, the principle of manifest covariance cannot be applied to separate parts of the
interacting system. Interaction in the Hamiltonian makes the time translations non-
trivial and non-linear. Since boosts and time translations are entangled in the Poincar´e
group, the transformations to the moving reference frame must be non-trivial and non-
linear as well. Theorem 12.1 demonstrates that deﬁnition (II) does not apply to the
time-dependent dynamics of interacting particles, and that the Lorentz invariance is
just an approximation.

12.3.3

Is there a Minkowski space-time?

In subsection 1.2.1 we discussed how the universality of Lorentz transformations al-
leged by the traditional approach leads to the picture of the world embedded in the

28Simple Lorentz transformation laws also apply to the matrix elements of the S-matrix in which
the time evolution is integrated over an inﬁnite time interval [65, 74, 78]. They are also true for
observables describing the system as a whole, e.g., for the total momentum, energy, and the center-
of-mass position.

12.3. DISCUSSION

351

In this picture, events are represented as points in the 4-
Minkowski space-time.
dimensional continuum, and particle trajectories are represented as worldlines. Boost
transformations are interpreted as linear deformations of the continuum while physical
events and worldlines just passively follow these deformations.

In our approach we reject the universality of boost transformations, and one may
ask: “how this new approach aﬀects the properties of the space-time continuum?” To
answer this question we must realize that in the real world boost transformations are
not universal. When we speak about boost transformations F (~θ) of any observable F
we should have in mind a real (generally interacting) physical system described by the
operator of total boost K = K0 + Z and use formula

F (~θ) = e−

i
¯h

Kc~θF e

Kc~θ

(12.70)

The fact that some of observables (like components of the total energy-momentum 4-
vector) transform according to universal Lorentz formulas (6.2) - (6.3) is an exception
rather than a rule. In the case when observable F refers to a subsystem of a physical
system, the transformation (12.70) has a complex form depending on the the state
of the system29 and interactions acting there. For example, boost transformations of
the particle’s trajectory are given by complex formulas depending on interactions in
which this particle participates and on positions and momenta of surrounding particles.
Therefore, the entire idea of universal Minkowski space-time, where physical events are
embedded like raisins in jelly, must be rejected. The idea of underlying background
continuum is just not needed. All physical predictions can be obtained from knowing
commutation relations (or Poisson brackets in the classical case) between operators of
observables, and using equations like (12.70).

external force, subject to only their mutual interaction. Their classical trajectories are
shown by dashed lines CAG and DBF in Fig. 12.3. In the scenario II, at time t = 0
(point A on the trajectory of particle 1) particle 1 experiences some external force,
e.g., an impact from a third particle 3,30 which changes the trajectory of the particle
1 to the one shown by a full line CAG’ in Fig. 12.3. The question is when the particle
2 will start to feel this impact?

29For example, transformations of observables of one particle depend on positions and momenta of

other particles in the system.

30The third particle 3 is supposed to be neutral (this could be an energetic photon), so that its

interaction with the electron 2 can be neglected.

352

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

The traditional approach maintains that interactions between particles are retarded,
i.e., any information about the change of the trajectory of the particle 1 can reach
particle 2 only after time t = R12/c, where R12 is the distance between the two particles.
This leads to the following description of the scenario II in Fig. 12.3(b): Particle 2 does
not recognize that the impact has happened until point E in which the electromagnetic
wave emitted at point A reaches the particle 2. Between points B and E, the trajectory
of the particle 2 is the same whether or not there was a collision at point A.

Let us now see what is the ground on which this conclusion is made. In the tra-
ditional approach, the speed of propagation of electromagnetic interactions is usually
discussed in terms of retarded solutions of Maxwell equations (Lienard-Wiechert po-
tentials). However, this discussion is not adequate because Maxwell equations are ap-
proximate (see subsection 11.1.1). Therefore, accurate description of electromagnetic
interactions must include quantum eﬀects. It is often declared that such a description
is given by the quantum ﬁeld theory. But this is not true either.

The logic of the ﬁeld approach presumes the retarded character of interactions from
the beginning. The argument goes like this. Since interaction transfers momentum and
energy between particles, the transfered momentum ∆p and energy ∆E must exist in
some form while en route from one particle to another. This requires existence of
some degrees of freedom not related to observable particles. QFT declares that these
degrees of freedom belong to the ﬁeld or to virtual particles which are sometimes drawn
as internal lines in the Feynman diagrams. However, this explanation is misleading.
First, as we discussed in subsection 12.1.1, QFT can describe time evolution only in
the form of S-matrix, i.e., integrated over inﬁnite time interval. Therefore, QFT does
not have an answer about the speed of propagation of interactions. Second, virtual
particles have rather peculiar properties (e.g., imaginary mass), so it is not surprising
that they have never been directly observed in experiment, and the question about the
speed of their propagation is meaningless.

The strongest justiﬁcation of the retarded character of interactions in the traditional
approach is Assertion E (the impossibility of the superluminal signaling, see subsection
1.2.1) whose “proof” was based on the application of Lorentz transformations to two
causally related events. However, we know from subsection 12.3.2 that for systems
with interactions, the Lorentz transformations are no longer valid. So, the Assertion
E is not valid as well.

12.3.5

Interaction of charged particles in RQD

Let us see how the question about the speed of propagation of interactions is handled
by our approach. One may notice that by performing the dressing transformation in
section 12.2 we cast QED in the form of direct interaction theory discussed in chapter
8. The Hamiltonian H(r1, p1; r2, p2) describing the interaction in the system of two
charged particles depends on instantaneous positions and momenta of particles. This

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

is clearly seen from the explicit expression for the electron-proton potential (12.51) -
(12.55) written in the v2/c2 approximation in the 2nd perturbation order. However, it
is important to realize that the two-particle interaction retains its instantaneous (not
retarded) form in all perturbation and v/c orders. If we were to assume any retardation
we would be forced to assume also that the momentum exchanged by the particles
exists in some form during the time interaction “travels” from one particle to another.
This would require existence of virtual particles, ﬁelds, or other carriers. However, in
the description provided in the electron+proton sector by the RQD interaction term
V d[d†a†da] there are no other degrees of freedom except those associated with the
dressed electron and proton. Therefore, retarded interactions would violate the law of
conservation of momentum.

The trajectories in the reference frame at rest are obtained from eq. (12.59)

Applying this discussion to the scenario II in Fig. 12.3(a), we see that the collision
at point A will be felt by the particle 2 instantaneously, and 2 will change its trajectory
to DBF ′ (see Fig. 12.3(a)). This certainly contradicts the special-relativistic taboo
on the superluminal propagation of interactions (Assertion E), but there is no contra-
diction with causality. Indeed, in the moving frame of reference O′, the trajectories of

is a function of instantaneous positions and momenta of both particles in the moving
reference frame O′ as well. Therefore, for the moving observer O′ the information
about event at A will reach particle 2 instantaneously, just as for the observer at rest
O. The eﬀect never precedes the cause in all frames of reference (the cause and the
eﬀect are simultaneous), so instantaneous potentials do not contradict causality. One
can also say that the instantaneous character of interaction, being a law of nature,
remains instantaneous in all physically equivalent inertial reference frames.

The instantaneous potential described above is only one part of the interaction
between charged particles in RQD. There is also an additional retarded interaction
whose origin can be explained as follows (see Fig. 12.3(a)). The impact on the particle 1
at point A causes acceleration of particle 1 and creation of the bremsstrahlung photons.
These photons, being real massless particles, propagate with the speed of light.31 There
is a chance that such a photon will reach the particle 2 at point E of its trajectory and
force 2 to change its course again (EF ′′), e.g., due to the Compton scattering term in
the total Hamiltonian. In this process, the force between two particles is transmitted
it is carried by a photon traveling with the speed of light.
in a retarded fashion:
Therefore, the full lines CAG′ and DBEF ′′ are the exact trajectories followed by the
electrons in the scenario II. Apparently, the two descriptions of the time evolution of
interacting particles depicted in Fig. 12.3(a) and 12.3(b) are fundamentally diﬀerent.
Only experiment can conclusively decide which one of these descriptions is correct.
Unfortunately, such an experiment has never been done.

One may notice that the situation described above is in qualitative contradiction
with Maxwell’s theory. In the Maxwell’s electrodynamics, the electromagnetic poten-
tials acting between particles and the electromagnetic waves describing the propagation

31In classical language, this is usually described as a transversal electromagnetic wave.

356

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

of light cannot be distinguished. They are described by the same potentials φ(r, t) and
A(r, t) or ﬁelds E(r, t) and B(r, t). In our approach, however, there is no direct con-
nection between the instantaneous Coulomb and magnetic interparticle interactions
and the radiation carried by free photons.32 The ideas similar to ours were expressed
by authors of [97] based on their analysis of classical electrodynamics.

12.3.6

Superluminal propagation of evanescent waves

The idea of separation of electromagnetic ﬁelds into non-propagating and propagating
components has a long history in optics. This idea is most apparent in the following
experimental situation. Consider a beam of light directed from the glass side on the
interface between glass (G1) and air (A) (see ﬁg. 12.4(a)). The total internal reﬂection
occurs when the incidence angle θ is greater than the Brewster angle. In this case, all
light is reﬂected at the interface and no light propagates into the air. However, since
Maxwell’s equations do not permit abrupt changes of ﬁelds at the interface, there is a
non-propagating wave extending into the air whose amplitude decreases exponentially
with the distance from the interface. This is called the evanescent light wave. The
reality of the evanescent wave can be conﬁrmed if another piece of glass (G2) is placed
near the interface (see ﬁg. 12.4(b)). Then the evanescent wave penetrates through
the gap, gets converted to the normal propagating light and escapes into the glass G2.
At the same time the intensity of light reﬂected at the interface decreases. The total
internal reﬂection becomes frustrated.

Similar evanescent waves can be observed in other situations, such as propagation of
microwaves through narrow waveguides or “dielectric mirrors”. In recent experiments
[3] the speed of propagation of the evanescent waves was investigated for microwaves
and visible light, and there are indications that this speed may be superluminal.33 In
particular, Haibel and Nimtz [98] suggested that the evanescent wave traverses the
gap in time which does not depend on the width of the gap and equals to the period
(inverse frequency) of the radiation.

The conventional approach regards evanescent waves as photons “tunneling” across
the classically forbidden region. However, our variant of electromagnetic theory sug-
gests an alternative, or rather a complementary, explanation. As we said repeatedly,
the propagation of light in vacuum should be represented as a ﬂow of massless parti-
cles - photons moving with velocity c. However, the propagation of light in a material
medium is a more complicated process. The photons of light impinge on atoms in the
material, get absorbed and re-emitted after some delay. These processes change the
conﬁguration of charged particles in the atom (electrons and the nucleus) and thus cre-

32Of course, there is an indirect connection: the radiation gets emitted or absorbed when charged

particles accelerate, e.g., in their collisions.

33There are discrepancies in theoretical interpretations of the data by diﬀerent groups, and the

question remains open whether or not the speed of the signal may exceed c.

CHAPTER 12. RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM DYNAMICS

ate electric and magnetic potentials propagating instantaneously around them. These
potentials changing in time excite charged particles in the neighboring atoms and may
lead to the emission of photons as well. Therefore, the propagation of the light front
through the medium is the result of interplay between all these processes working in
concert. In most materials, the instantaneous electric and magnetic potentials do not
play a signiﬁcant role in the propagation of light, and the speed of light c′ in the
medium is less than the speed of light in vacuum c′ = c/n, where n > 1 is the refrac-
tion index. However, one can imagine situations in which the instantaneous potentials
can dominate, and the speed of the light front may exceed c.

Consider again the situation depicted in ﬁg. 12.4 (b). When the initial light wave
reaches the interface G1 - A, the charged particles at the interface start to oscillate.
These oscillations give rise to some dipole moments at the interface which instanta-
neously aﬀect the charges at the interface A - G2. These charges also start to oscillate
and emit photons which propagate inside the piece of class G2 in the form of a “nor-
mal” light beam. In this interpretation, the evanescent wave in the gap is nothing but
the instantaneous Coulomb and magnetic potentials acting between oscillating charges
on the two interfaces. The coupling between two interfaces decreases exponentially
with the size of the gap, and the time of the “evanescent light” transmission does
not depend on the size of the gap in accordance with experimental observations. Ac-
cording to this interpretation, there are no particles (photons) crossing the gap even
in the tunneling mode. It seems that the most realistic description of the frustrated
total internal reﬂection should take into account both mentioned eﬀects: the photon
tunneling and the direct Coulomb and magnetic couplings between charges on both
sides of the gap.

The central idea of our approach to relativity is the dynamical character of boosts. This
property (Postulate R) was derived in subsection 8.2.3 from the apparent absence of
dynamical behavior in space translations and rotations. An indirect manifestation of
this property is the instantaneous propagation of interactions discussed in subsections
12.3.5 and 12.3.6. Are there experimental eﬀects in which the dynamical properties
of boosts can be observed directly? As we discussed in subsection 1.2.2, such an
experiment should be able to see the time evolution of particles during interaction,
and there is a class of high-energy physics experiments doing just that. These are
measurements of the decay law of unstable systems.1

In subsection 9.2.4 we established that decay operators do not appear in QED, so we
ignored these types of operators in our discussions.2 Here we will focus on the decays,
which commonly occur for particles participating in weak interactions. Our primary
goal is to calculate the decay law of a moving unstable particle and to demonstrate
that the Einstein’s formula for the slowing of the decay (1.1) is approximate. We will
ﬁnd small but fundamentally important corrections to this formula. This will serve as

1The experiments measuring time-dependent oscillations between diﬀerent particle species, e.g.,
kaons or neutrinos, also belong to this category, but their accuracy is much lower than in the decay
experiments, so they will not be discussed here.

2Note that decays are quite common in systems with electromagnetic interactions. For example,
in subsection 12.2.4 we discussed the spontaneous light emission (i.e., decay) from excited states of
the hydrogen atom. However, these processes are related to multiparticle states and are governed by
phys interactions, such as d†a†c†da + d†a†dac. In this chapter we are interested in one-particle decays.

interaction-dependent.

We will consider a model theory with three hypothetical massive spinless particles

is energetically possible. The simplest interaction responsible for the decay can be

rather straightforward (see Fig. 13.2). In this region, the denominator in the integrand
of (13.13) does not vanish, and F (m) is a well-deﬁned function which is equal to zero
and monotonically declines as m grows. The graphical solution of eq.
at m =
, mb + mc] as the intersection of the line
(13.12) can be obtained in the interval [
m
ma and the function F (m) (point M0 in Fig. 13.2). The corresponding value of
m is an eigenvalue of the interacting mass operator, and the corresponding eigenstate
is a mixture of the “bare” particle a and the pair b + c.

Finding the spectrum of the interacting mass in the region [mb + mc,

] is more
tricky due to the singularity under the integral sign in (13.13). Let us ﬁrst discuss
our approach qualitatively, using the graphical representation. We will do this by ﬁrst
assuming that the momentum spectrum of the problem is discrete (e.g., by placing the
system in a box or applying periodic boundary conditions as discussed in section 9.1)
and then making a gradual transition to the continuous spectrum (e.g., increasing the
size of the box to inﬁnity). In the discrete spectrum approximation, eq. (13.12) takes
the form

which have singularities at mi. The positions of these singularities
of functions |
are shown as open circles and dashed vertical lines in Fig. 13.3, and the shape of
the function F (m) in this approximation is shown by a thick full line in Fig. 13.3.
The spectrum of the interacting mass operator now can be found at the points of
intersection of the line m
ma with the function F (m). These points Mi are shown
by full circles in Fig. 13.3.7 So, the derivative required in eq. (13.14) is graphically
represented as the slopes of the function F (m) at points M1, M2, M3, . . .. The problem
is that in the limit of continuous spectrum the distances between points mi tend to
zero, function F (m) wildly oscillates, and its derivative tends to inﬁnity.

−

To calculate function F (m) and its derivative for m > mb + mc we will use a clever

idea ﬁrst suggested in ref. [99]. Let us change the integration variable

CHAPTER 13. DECAYS

The importance of formulas (13.22) and (13.24) is that they were derived from very
general assumptions. So, the exponential decay law is expected to be universally
valid. This prediction is conﬁrmed by experiment: so far no deviations from the
exponential decay law (13.24) were observed. The approximation used to derive eq.
(13.24) may be not valid for decaying strongly interacting particles or resonances.
However, their lifetime9 is very short
23s, so the time dependence of the decay
10−
cannot be observed.

≈

13.2 Decay of a moving particle

In the previous section we calculated the decay law at rest. In this section we will be
concerned with the decay law of a moving particle. Our presentation in this chapter
will be based mainly on the article [12].

13.2.1 Decay caused by boost

Let us denote ω0(t) and ωθ(t) the nondecay probabilities observed at time t in the
reference frame O at rest and in the moving reference frame O′, respectively. The
traditional approach based on the Assertion D predicts that

ωθ(t) = ω0(t/ cosh θ)

(13.25)

This formula is supposed to be exact and independent on the type of observed par-
ticle and on the interaction governing the decay. Let us show that this formula
can not be exactly true in RQD. If we assume the validity of (13.25) then ωθ(0) =

in contradiction to (13.4). Therefore, the time dilation formula (13.25) cannot be
accurate. The non-decay probability in the moving frame of reference is not unity
even at t = 0. Thus the unstable particle looks decayed for a fast moving observer.

9The lifetime of tanunstable system is inversely proportional to the width of the mass distribution
2Γc2 . During the lifetime, the nondecay probability decreases from 1 to e−1.

One may conclude that this peculiar property indicates that our choice of the instant
form dynamics is wrong. However, this conclusion would not be correct, because other
forms of dynamics are even worse. For example, in the point form dynamics, the boost
operator does not depend on interaction (see Table 8.1). In this case the particle is
stable under boosts. However, then it would be unstable under space translations.
Such a behavior has never been seen in experiments. Moreover, by calculating the
decay law of a moving particle in the point form dynamics we obtain10

which means that the decay rate for the moving particle is cosh θ times faster than
that for the particle at rest. This is in direct contradiction with experiment, which is
just another reason to reject the point form dynamics.

ing or preparation devices. Usually, we are preparing and monitoring moving unstable
particles using a stationary setup. The state containing with 100% probability the

The magnitude of the corrections to the Einstein’s formula is expected to grow
with the ratio Γ/ma [101]. For the example considered above, this ratio was rather
large Γ/ma = 0.02. Still, the maximum relative quantum correction was just about
0.4 % of the total nondecay probability. Note that decay laws for particles with such
a short lifetime (small values of Γ and Γ/ma) as in our example cannot be measured
experimentally. However, for all known unstable systems with measurable lifetime
the ratio Γ/ma is too small to give any chance of experimental observations of the

SUMMARY

Long experience has taught me this about the status
of mankind with regard to matters requiring thought:
the less people know and understand about them,
the more positively they attempt to argue concerning
them, while on the other hand to know and understand
a multitude of things renders men cautious in passing
judgment upon anything new.
Galileo Galilei

In this book we suggest a new approach to relativity and quantum ﬁeld theory. This
approach allows us to unify quantum and relativistic ideas in a non-contradictory
way.
It provides a new theory of electromagnetic interactions of charged particles
and photons which is free of ultraviolet divergences, and, in addition to the correct
description of scattering and bound states, this theory is capable of predicting the time
evolution of particles in the region of interaction.

Our approach is based on two fundamental physical principles. These principles

are not new; we just oﬀered their novel interpretation.

The principle of relativity tells that inertial transformations of observers form the
Poincar´e group. Naturally, the transformations of observers must be represented by
transformations (kinematical or dynamical) of observables. Combined with the knowl-
edge that time translations are dynamical (interaction-dependent) and space transla-
tions and rotations are kinematical (interaction-independent), the relativity principle
implies that boosts are dynamical. This means that boost transformations of observ-
ables (positions, momenta, etc.) of interacting particles are not given by universal
Lorentz formulas, as was believed previously. This, in turn, implies that the concepts
of Minkowski spacetime and manifest covariance are not exact and should be avoided

381

382

in a rigorous theory.

CHAPTER 14.

SUMMARY

The second principle is that physical systems are made of real particles, therefore
a consistent theory should avoid assigning independent degrees of freedom to non-
Ideally, ﬁelds and virtual
observable ingredients such as ﬁelds or virtual particles.
particles should not be a part of the theory at all. Isolated real particles should have
experimentally measured mass, and there should be no self-interaction eﬀects in the
one-particle and no-particle (vacuum) states.

The Hilbert space we are working with is the Fock space which has sectors with any
number of particles. Any state of a physical system is represented by a unit vector in
this Fock space. For each state vector we can ﬁnd the probabilities for diﬀerent particle
contents and the probability distributions for particle observables. So, the state vector
in the Fock space fully describes all physical information we want to know about the
system.

The principle of relativity is realized by the fact that transitions between diﬀerent
inertial reference frames are represented by unitary operators in the Fock space (Wigner
theorem). These operators form a unitary representation of the Poincar´e group in the
Fock space. The generators of this representation are identiﬁed with the observables
of total energy H, total momentum P, total angular momentum J and the operators
of boosts K. The kinematical character of space translations and rotations implies
that generators P and J have the same simple form as for non-interacting particles.
The most diﬃcult part of the RQD approach is the construction of the interacting
Hamiltonian H and boost generator K. In this book, we borrow the expressions for
these operators from the standard “ﬁeld quantization” approach in quantum electro-
dynamics. However, our interpretation of QED quantum ﬁelds is diﬀerent from their
traditional interpretation as “basic ingredients of the universe”. For us, quantum ﬁelds
are just convenient combinations of particle creation and annihilation operators which
simplify the notation for operators H and K and the proof of their relativistic in-
variance. The expressions for H and K obtained in the ﬁeld quantization approach
are not ﬁnal. Two rounds of corrections are required to obtain satisfactory genera-
tors of the Poincar´e group. The ﬁrst round is the addition of inﬁnite renormalization
counterterms which are required to obtain a ﬁnite S-matrix in good agreement with
experiment. This step is well known from the traditional renormalization approach
pioneered by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga. The second round is the applica-
tion of a unitary “dressing transformation” which results in a ﬁnite Hamiltonian whose
interaction potentials do not act on vacuum and one-particle states.

Three major advantages of our approach are

•

its simplicity. Theoretically the RQD approach is not much diﬀerent from or-
dinary quantum mechanics, the major diﬀerence being the allowance for the
processes of particle creation and annihilation. The time evolution, scattering,
bound states, etc. can be calculated according to usual rules of quantum me-

383

chanics without regularization, renormalization, and other tricks.

•

•

it operates only with observable quantities (particle observables and direct inter-
particle interactions) without the use of non-observable bare and virtual particles
and ﬁelds.

it goes beyond the S-matrix description of physical processes and allows us to
predicts the time evolution and boost transformations of observables in the full
range of particle energies.

In the framework of RQD we demonstrated that Einstein’s special relativity is
It is true that for a mov-
wrong about the universality of the time dilation eﬀect.
ing observer the processes in the physical system at rest appear slower. However this
slowing is not a universal eﬀect as postulated by the special theory of relativity, but
depends on the physical nature of the process and on involved interactions. We ex-
plicitly calculated the eﬀect of “time dilation” on the decay law of a moving unstable
particle and found small, but fundamentally important, corrections to the Einstein’s
time dilation formula. A similar eﬀect (a non-Einsteinian velocity dependence of the
oscillation period) should be also visible in neutrino oscillation experiments. Unfortu-
nately, the magnitude of these eﬀects are much smaller than the resolution of modern
measuring techniques.

In RQD we found that the electromagnetic interactions between charged parti-
cles propagate instantaneously. These direct interparticle interactions are observed in
experiments as near-ﬁeld or evanescent “waves”. Recent experimental data are consis-
tent with the RQD prediction that evanescent waves propagate superluminally. This
action-at-a-distance does not contradict the principle of causality, when the interac-
tion dependence of the boost generators is properly taken into account. New precise
experiments are needed to conﬁrm unambiguously that the speed of propagation of
the Coulomb and magnetic forces (=evanescent waves) exceeds the speed of light.

This book presents just basic foundations of relativistic quantum dynamics. There

are several lines of research whose further development seems the most promising:

•

At the end of subsection 12.3.1 we speculated that consistent theory of interacting
particles can be formulated without the use of local quantum ﬁelds and gauge
invariancethat have rather questionable relationship to physical reality. In our
opinion, the postulates of relativistic invariance, stability of vacuum and one-
particle states, and cluster separability should be satisﬁed in any realistic theory.
It is still not clear if these postulates are suﬃcient to unambiguously derive the
dressed particle Hamiltonian of RQD. Whic additional (if any) postulates are
required?

•

In section 12.2 we derived the RQD expressions for interactions between charged
particles in the 2nd perturbation order. Derivations of other low order potentials

384

CHAPTER 14.

SUMMARY

are also of considerable interest. For example, the 2nd order electron-photon
interaction potential is responsible for the Compton scattering. The 3rd order
bremsstrahlung potential determines the absorption and spontaneous emission of
light by atoms and molecules. The 4th order radiative corrections to the Coulomb
potential are necessary for calculating the Lamb shifts. The recipe for obtaining
these potentials can be found in section 12.1, and the easiest way to perform
actual calculations is through the use of the diagram technique outlined in section
9.3. Conceptually, these calculations are not much diﬀerent from those involved
in Feynman diagrams for the usual time-ordered perturbation theory. However,
the number of diﬀerent terms grows with the perturbation order much faster
than in the Feynman-Dyson perturbation theory, and some technical diﬃculties
are anticipated.

Derivation of the classical (¯h
0) approximation to RQD is of considerable
interest. This approximation should be diﬀerent from the Maxwell’s theory, be-
cause in RQD there are no degrees of freedom associated with the longitudinal
part of electromagnetic ﬁelds: RQD is formulated in terms of real physical parti-
cles (electrons, photons, etc.) and instantaneous potentials acting between them.
For slowly moving charged particles, when radiation and absorption of photons
can be neglected, suﬃciently accurate results can be obtained with the use of the
Coulomb (12.51) and Darwin (12.53) potentials. The tricky part is to formulate
the classical description of the wave function of the photon subsystem and its
interaction with charged fermions. This interaction should be derived from the
bremsstrahlung and Compton potentials in the RQD Hamiltonian.

The RQD approach can also be extended for treatment of non-electromagnetic
interactions. There is no much beneﬁt in applying this approach to weak and
strong nuclear forces, because they are short-range, and experimental studies of

interesting to consider gravity from the RQD point of view. Note that RQD
avoids using the Minkowski spacetime picture, therefore description of gravity
in this formalism will not use the Einsteinian concept of the curved spacetime.
Most likely, the relevant theory of gravitational interactions will be constructed
in analogy with QED.

A.2.1 Basics of 3D space

Let us now consider the familiar 3D position space. This space consists of points. We
can arbitrarily select one such point 0 and call it origin. Then we can draw a vector a
from the origin to any other point in space. We can also deﬁne a sum of two vectors
by the parallelogram rule (see Fig. A.1) and the multiplication of a vector by a real
(also denoted by a) and
scalar. There is a natural deﬁnition of the length of vector
the angle α(a, b) between two vectors a and b. Then the scalar product of two vectors
can be deﬁned by formula

(A.6)

Two non-zero vectors are called perpendicular or orthogonal if their scalar product is
zero.

We can build an orthonormal basis of 3 mutually perpendicular vectors of unit
length i, j and k along x, y, and z axes respectively.2 Then each vector a can be
represented as a linear combination

or as a column of its components or coordinates 3

a = axi + ayj + azk

The transposed vector can be represented as a row

a = 

aT = [ax, ay, az]

One can easily verify that the scalar product (A.6) can be written in several equivalent
forms

2Let us agree that the triple of basis vectors (i, j, k) forms a right-handed system as shown in Fig.
A.1. Such a system is easy to recognize by the following rule of thumb: If we point a corkscrew in
the direction of k and rotate it in the clockwise direction (from i to j), then the corkscrew will move
in the direction of vector k.

3So, physical space can be identiﬁed with the vector space R3 of all triples of real numbers (see
subsection A.1.2). We will mark vector indices either by letters x, y, z or by numbers 1,2,3, as conve-
nient.

Scalars, vectors, and tensors.

There are two approaches to rotations, as well as to any inertial transformation: active
and passive. An active rotation rotates all objects around the origin while keeping
the orientation of basis vectors. A passive rotation simply changes the directions of
the basis vectors. Unless noted otherwise, we will use the passive representation of
rotations.

scalar if it is not aﬀected by rotations. Denoting

Matrices satisfying condition (A.10) are called orthogonal. Thus, any rotation has a
unique representative in the set of orthogonal matrices.

However, not every orthogonal matrix R corresponds to a rotation. To see that,

we can write

1 = det(I)

= det(RT R)
= det(RT ) det(R)
= (det(R))2

which implies that if R is orthogonal then det(R) =
1. Any rotation can be connected
by a continuous path with the trivial rotation which is represented, of course, by the
unit matrix with unit determinant. Since continuous transformations cannot abruptly
change the determinant from 1 to -1, only matrices with

±

det(R) = 1

(A.12)

have a chance to represent rotations.6 We conclude that rotations are in one-to-one
correspondence with orthogonal matrices having a unit determinant.

Let us consider some examples. Any rotation around the z-axis does not change
the z-component of any vector. The most general matrix satisfying this property can
be written as

A.2.4 Vector parameterization of rotations

The matrix representation of rotations (A.7) is useful for describing transformations of
vector and tensor components. However, sometimes it is more convenient to charac-
terize rotation in a more physical way by the rotation axis and the rotation angle. In
other words, a rotation can be described by a single vector ~φ = φxi + φyj + φzk, such
that its direction represents the axis of the rotation and its length φ
represents
the angle of the rotation. So we can characterize any rotation by three real numbers
~φ

Exponent of any linear combination of generators ti also results in an orthogonal matrix
with unit determinant, i.e., represents a rotation. Therefore, objects ti form a basis
in the vector space of generators of the rotation group. This vector space is referred
to as the Lie algebra of the rotation group. General properties of Lie algebras will be
discussed in Appendix A.3.

A.3.1

Lie groups

Lie group12 is a group whose elements can be parameterized by n continuous parame-
13 so that group multiplication and inversion are diﬀerentiable functions of these

parameters. We saw in the Appendix A.2 that elements of the rotation group are in
isomorphic correspondence with vectors (or points) ~φ in the 3D space. The multiplica-
tion and inversion laws deﬁne two diﬀerentiable mappings between points in this space
(see subsection A.2.5). Thus, the rotation group is an example of a Lie group.

It appears that, just as in the rotation group considered above, in a general Lie

group it is also possible to choose a parameterization of group elements
so that

Then, similarly to what we did in subsection A.2.6 for the rotation group, we can
introduce inﬁnitesimal transformations or generators ta (a = 1, 2, . . . , n) for a general
Lie group and express group elements in the vicinity of the identity as exponential
functions of generators

Let us introduce function ~g(~ζ, ~ξ) which associates with two points ~ζ and ~ξ in the group
manifold a third point ~g(~ζ, ~ξ) according to the group multiplication law, i.e.,

From our discussion in previous subsection it is clear that generators of a Lie group
form a Lie algebra. Consider, for example, the group of rotations.
In the matrix
representation, the generators are linear combinations of matrices (A.26) - (A.28), i.e.,
they are arbitrary antisymmetric matrices satisfying AT =

In the vicinity of identity, any group element can be represented as exponent exp(x)
of a Lie algebra element x (see eq. (A.29)). As product of two group elements is another
group element, we must have for any x and y from the Lie algebra

exp(x) exp(y) = exp(z)

(A.39)

where z is also an element from the Lie algebra. Then there should exist a mapping
in the Lie algebra which associates with any two elements x and y a third element z,
such that eq. (A.39) is satisﬁed.

The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ theorem [102] gives us the explicit form of this

mapping16

This means that commutation relations in the Lie algebra contain full information
about the group multiplication law in the vicinity of the identity element. In many
cases, it is much easier to deal with generators and their commutators than directly
with group elements and their multiplication law.

There is a unique Lie algebra AG corresponding to each Lie group G. However, there
are many groups with the same Lie algebra. These groups have the same structure in
the vicinity of the unit element, but their global topological properties are diﬀerent.

A Lie subalgebra B of a Lie algebra A is a subspace in A which is closed with
B. If H is a subgroup of a Lie
B, then [x, y]

respect to commutator, i.e., if x, y
group G, then its Lie algebra AH is a subalgebra of AG.

The inner product space H is called complete if any Cauchy sequence18 of vectors

19The notions of completeness and closedness are rather technical. Finite dimensional inner product
spaces are always complete, and their subspaces are always closed. Although in quantum mechanics
we normally deal with inﬁnite-dimensional spaces, most properties having relevance to physics do not
depend on the number of dimensions. So, we will ignore the diﬀerence between ﬁnite- and inﬁnite-
dimensional spaces and freely use ﬁnite n-dimensional examples in our proofs and demonstrations. In
particular, we will tacitly assume that every subspace A is closed or forced to be closed by adding all
vectors which are limits of Cauchy sequences in A.

The sum of two operators and the multiplication of an operator by a number are easily

We can deﬁne the product AB of two operators as the transformation obtained by
a sequential application of B and then A. This is also a linear transformation, i.e.,
operator. The matrix of the product AB is “row-by-column” product of their matrices
aij and bij

Note that two or more eigenvectors of a Hermitian operator F may correspond to the
same eigenvalue (such an eigenvalue is called degenerate). Then any linear combination
of these eigenvectors is again an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue. The span of all

Theorem A.19 : Two Hermitian operators F and G commute if and only if all their

Proof: We write

If [Pi, Qj] = 0, then obviously [F, G] = 0. To prove the reverse statement we notice that from Lemma A.18 each spectral
projection Pi commutes with G. From the same Lemma it follows that each spectral projection of G commutes with
Pi.

A.6. REPRESENTATIONS OF GROUPS

433

A.6 Representations of groups

A representation of a group G is a homomorphism between the group G and the group
of linear transformations in a linear space. In other words, to each group element g
there corresponds a matrix Ug with non-zero determinant. The group multiplication
is represented by the matrix product and

Ug1Ug2 = Ug1g2
1
Ug−1 = U −
g
Ue = I

Each group has an trivial representation by identity operators. If the linear space of
the representation is a Hilbert space
, then we can deﬁne a particularly useful class
of unitary representations. These representations are made of unitary operators.

H

A.6.1 Unitary representations of groups

Two representations Ug and U ′g in the Hilbert space
if there exists a unitary operator V such that

H

are called unitarily equivalent

U ′g = V UgV −

1

Having two representations Ug and Vg in Hilbert spaces H1 and H2 respectively, we
H2
can always build another unitary representation Wg in the Hilbert space H = H1 ⊕
by joining two matrices in the block diagonal form.

Wg =

Ug
0
0 Vg #

"

(A.66)

This is called the direct sum of two representations. The direct sum is denoted by the
sign

⊕

Wg = Ug ⊕

Vg

A representation is called reducible if there is such unitary transformation which
brings it into the block diagonal form (A.66). Otherwise, the representation is called
irreducible.

Casimir operators are operators which commute with all representatives of group

elements.

APPENDIX A. MATHEMATICAL APPENDIX

•

Schur’s ﬁrst lemma: Casimir operators of an unitary irreducible representation
of any group are constant multiples of the unit matrix [104].

From Appendix A.3 we know that the elements of any Lie group in the vicinity of the
identity can be represented as

where A is a vector from the Lie algebra of the group. Correspondingly, any matrix of
the unitary group representation in

can be written as

where FA is a Hermitian operator and ¯h is an arbitrary real constant. Operators FA
form a representation of the Lie algebra in the Hilbert space
. If the commutator

representatives is

One can easily see that boost transformations (A.74) conserve the pseudo-scalar

product. If we represent rotations by 4

4 matrices

then they also preserve the pseudo-scalar product (A.75). A general Lorentz transfor-
mation can be represented as (rotation)

(boost) (see eq. (2.35)), so its matrix

Λ = B(~θ)R(~φ)

(A.76)

preserves the pseudo-scalar product as well.

which means that the matrix Λ must satisfy

A general Poincar´e transformation (Λ, a) is a composition of a Lorentz transfor-
mation given by the matrix Λ and translation in space and time characterized by a
4-vector a = (t, x, y, z). The unit element is (I, 0). According to our convention in
subsection 2.1.1, when transformation (Λ, a) is applied to a 4-vector τ , the Lorentz
transformation is made ﬁrst and is followed by the translation, i.e.,

(Λ, a)τ = (I, a)(Λ, 0)τ

= (I, a)Λτ
= Λτ + a

24They can be obtained from eqs (A.26) - (A.28).
25They can be obtained by diﬀerentiating explicit representation of boosts (2.40) - (2.42).

The composition of two Poincar´e group elements acts as

(Λ2, a2)(Λ1, a1)τ = (Λ2, a2)(Λ1τ + a1)
= Λ2Λ1τ + Λ2a1 + a2

which means that

The inverse of (Λ, a) is

UNIFICATION OF ELECTROMAGNETISM AND GRAVITATION
IN THE FRAMEWORK OF GENERAL GEOMETRY

Shervgi S. Shahverdiyev∗

Institute of Physics, Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences, Baku, Azerbaijan

Abstract

A new geometry, called General geometry, is constructed. It is proven that
its the most simplest special case is geometry underlying Electromagnetism.
Another special case is Riemannian geometry. Action for electromagnetic
ﬁeld and Maxwell equations are derived from curvature function of geom-
etry underlying Electromagnetism.
It is shown that equation of motion
for a particle interacting with electromagnetic ﬁeld coincides exactly with
equation for geodesics of geometry underlying Electromagnetism. It is also
shown that Electromagnetism can not be geometrized in the framework
of Riemannian geometry. Using General Geometry we propose a uniﬁed
model of electromagnetism and gravitation which reproduces Electromag-
netism and Gravitation and predicts that electromagnetic ﬁeld is a source
for gravitational ﬁeld. This theory is formulated in four dimensional space-
time and does not contain additional ﬁelds.

This can be generalized to deﬁnition of an underlying geometry for any theory. In
the present paper, we understand geometrization of a theory as follows:1. Equation
of motion for particle interacting with a given ﬁeld must coincide with equation for
geodesics of the corresponding geometry. 2. Equation of motion for the given ﬁeld
must be related to curvature characteristics of the corresponding geometry.

Because, Riemannian geometry and theory of gravitation satisfy these two require-
ments, Riemannian geometry is considered as an underlying geometry for gravitation.
As it is known equation or action function for gravitation could not be found using
tools of ﬁeld theory because in order to get conserved energy momentum for grav-
itational ﬁeld it was required to add to the action inﬁnite number of terms. Only
geometrization principle made it possible to ﬁnd a proper action for gravitation [1].

After this was realized [2]–[3] at the beginning of XX century, many physicists and
mathematicians tried to geometrize electromagnetism and unify it with gravitation
using geometrization principle [4]–[14]. All these approaches considered this problem
in the framework of Riemannian geometry and failed to satisfy the above mentioned
requirements completely or to reproduce Electromagnetism and Gravitation exactly. I
will mention drawbacks of two well known theories, only. They are Weyl and Kaluza-
Klein theories. Drawbacks of Weyl theory are that some of its predictions contradict
experiment [15]. Drawbacks of Kaluza-Klein theory are that it has charge/mass prob-
lem and additional dilaton ﬁeld. As it is noted by its originator, T. Kaluza, this theory
is not applicable even to electrons because of the charge/mass problem [5].

To solve these problems, instead of increasing dimensionality of spacetime or choos-
ing diﬀerent metrics in Riemannian geometry, we construct a new geometry, called
General geometry. We show that it includes Riemannian geometry as a special case,
its the most simplest special case, which have completely diﬀerent properties than
Riemannian geometry, is geometry underlying Electromagnetism. Using its another
special case we propose a uniﬁed model of electromagnetism and gravitation which re-
produces electromagnetism and gravitation exactly and predicts that electromagnetic
ﬁeld is a source for gravitational ﬁeld. It is formulated in four dimensional spacetime

2

and does not contain any additional ﬁelds. Moreover, we demonstrate that Electro-
magnetism can not be geometrized in the framework of Riemannian geometry, because
electromagnetic interaction has diﬀerent properties than gravitational one.

Geometry underlying the proposed model is created by interacting particles and
sources for electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds unlike geometry underlying gravi-
tation (Riemannian geometry, which is created by sources for gravitational ﬁeld only).

2 General Geometry

In this section we construct a new geometry. This geometry includes Riemannian geom-
etry, geometry underlying Electromagnetism (see next section), geometry underlying a
uniﬁed model of Electromagnetism and Gravitation, and inﬁnite number of geometries,
physical interpretation of which is not known at the present time, as special cases. Be-
cause of this we call it General Geometry. Besides mathematical applications, this new
geometry has important physical applications. We demonstrate this in next section.

Let M be a manifold with coordinates xλ, λ = 1, ..., n. Consider a curve on this

manifold xλ(u). Vector ﬁeld

has coordinates ξλ. In Riemannian geometry it is accepted that

where Γ′σ
λν(x) are functions of x only. Because of the form of right hand side of (1) there
exists parallel transport of vectors along a curve. And vice versa, if there exist parallel
transport of vectors, the right hand side of (1) must be in the form of Γ′σ
uξλ [15].
To construct General Geometry we do not require existence of parallel transport

λν(x)xν

and assume that

λ(x, xu) are general functions of x and xu. The next step is to consider x as a function

Γσ
of two parameters u, υ and ﬁnd lim ∆ξσ/∆u∆υ.

In order to do that we need

and considering each order in xu or their combinations separately we deﬁne a set of new

3 Geometry of Electromagnetism

In the case of Electromagnetism we do know equation for the ﬁeld and particles in-
teracting with it, but we do not know geometry underlying it. This is the reversed
case for gravitation. We need to know geometry underlying electromagnetism because
in that case we can construct geometry underlying uniﬁed model of electromagnetism
and gravitation and as in the case of gravitation, derive equation for the uniﬁed model.
For geometry of electromagnetism, we consider the most simplest case of General

is an underlying geometry for electromagnetism we must show that equation of motion
for a particle interacting with electromagnetic ﬁeld coincides with equation of geodesics
in this geometry, and Maxwell equations and Lagrangian for electromagnetic ﬁeld are
related to its curvature characteristics.

Geometry deﬁned by (3) has diﬀerent properties than Riemannian geometry deﬁned
by (1). We do not get into details here. We simply mention that in this geometry the

4

notion of parallel transport is not deﬁned. As we show in the sequel this makes it be
underlying geometry for Electromagnetism.

To obtain equations for geodesics we substitute ξλ in (3) by xλ

This is exactly equation of motion for a charged particle moving in electromagnetic

proved this relation between Fσλ and Aµ.

It remains to show that Maxwell equations and Lagrangian for electromagnetic ﬁeld
is related to curvature characteristics of geometry (3). To this end let us ﬁnd curvature

Vector Rλ is an analog of Ricci tensor. Equations Rλ = 0 coincide with the Maxwell
equations. In order to construct a Lagrangian we need a scalar function. In our case
we have two quantities Rλ and Aλ. Aλ originates from the length of a curve (metric)
as gµν originates from the length of a curve in Riemannian geometry. We can construct
from Rλ and Aλ a Lagrangian

R = AλRλ = ∂µ(AλF µ

This coincides with the Lagrangian of electromagnetic ﬁeld up to total derivative.

We see that as in the case of Riemannian geometry and gravitation we can ﬁnd
equations and action functional for electromagnetic ﬁeld from geometric characteristics
of geometry underlying Electromagnetism. And equation for geodesics coincides with
the equation of motion for a particle interacting with electromagnetic ﬁeld.

From the geometrical point of view a charged particle interacting with electromag-
netic ﬁeld can be considered as a free particle in the spacetime with the length of a
cmAµdxµ and equation for geodesic

This theory does not have any drawbacks like in the theories constructed before.
It reproduces electromagnetism exactly, is free from additional ﬁelds and extra dimen-
sions.

4 Uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and gravitation

Now, we consider a diﬀerent special case of General Geometry. For geometry underlying
our uniﬁed model we choose functions Γ and ˜Γ as

Γσ

λ(x, xu, xυ) = F σ

λ(x(u, υ))+Γσ

λν(x)xν

λ(x, xu, xυ) = F σ

In this paper we assume these relations and declare Aµ as electromagnetic ﬁeld and gµν
as gravitational ﬁeld. These relations between F and A, and Γ and gµν are proven in
[16] and it is shown that Aµ can be identiﬁed with electromagnetic ﬁeld, q with charge,
m with mass of a particle interacting with Aµ, c with the velocity of the light, and gµν
with gravitational ﬁeld.

Note, that the action is invariant under gauge transformations of ﬁelds and general
transformations of coordinates. Covariant derivative appears naturally in this formal-
ism. Hence, geometrization principle leads to an action which is invariant under gauge
transformations of ﬁelds and general transformations of coordinates. We conclude that
geometrization principle is more general than gauge principle.

Because geometrization principle gave true equation for gravitational ﬁeld [1], we
can be sure that this equation is also true. The proposed theory gives exactly Grav-
itation when electromagnetic ﬁeld is equal to zero and Electromagnetism when grav-
itational ﬁeld is equal to zero.
It predicts that electromagnetic ﬁeld is a source for
gravitational ﬁeld. This theory is formulated in four dimensional spacetime and does
not contain any additional ﬁelds.

For Riemannian geometry

it is possible to make a change of coordinates so that its right hand side will be equal to
zero (parallel transport), because of its right hand side structure. In new coordinates
x′, equation for geodesics becomes

d2x′σ
du2 = 0.
From physical point of view this corresponds to ﬁnding a reference frame where trajec-
tory of particles is strait line, because this equation must coincide with the equation of
motion. For gravitational interaction we can ﬁnd a reference frame where gravitational
interaction is absent. Accordingly, Riemannian geometry is suitable for gravitational
interaction only. For electromagnetic interactions it is not possible to ﬁnd a reference
frame where it is absent. Therefore, all attempts to geometrize electromagnetism or
unify it with gravitation in the framework of Riemannian geometry must fail (see also
[17]).

On the other hand for geometry

dξσ
du

=

−

(F σ

λ(x) + Γσ

λν(x)xν

u)ξλ

it is not possible to eliminate its right hand side by changing coordinates because of
F σ
λ term. And this property makes it be underlying geometry for the proposed uniﬁed
model.

In general relativity, geometry underlying gravitation and metric are independent
of properties of interacting particles. This is a consequence of equivalence principle.
Geometry and metric depends on the characteristics of sources for gravitational ﬁeld
gµν only. For electromagnetic interactions there is no equivalence principle, so geometry
and metric underlying electromagnetism and uniﬁed model of electromagnetism and
gravitation must depend on characteristics of interacting particles, because particles of
diﬀerent charges move in electromagnetic ﬁeld diﬀerently.

For our model we have

∂νAµ) + Γσ

u)ξλ.

Accordingly, geometry underlying uniﬁed model of electromagnetism and gravitation
depends not only on the characteristics of sources for Aµ and gµν but also on the
characteristics of interacting particles q and m. This means that geometry and the
cmAµ(x)dxµ are created by interacting
length of a curve (metric) ds =
particles too, together with sources unlike gravitational interaction. This gives us a
new understanding of problem of geometry and matter.

Next, we note that in General Relativity, if we consider sources for gravitational

ﬁeld we add the so called source term gµνT µν to the action

gS =

Z

dx(√

gR′ + gµνT µν).

T µν is the energy– momentum tensor of sources for gravitational ﬁeld. This is called
the ”covariance principle”, i.e. an assumption. In the other words it can be rephrased
as ”everything that has energy couples to gravity”. Some scientists misinterpret this
principle as a prediction of General Relativity in the form ”everything that has energy
is a source for gravitational ﬁeld”. It is obvious that this is not correct, because all
principles (action principle, geometrization principle, covariance principle and etc.)i.e.
assumptions can not be at the same time predictions. Therefore, we can not replace
T µν with energy- momentum tensor of any ﬁeld, if it is not a source for gµν. Inclusion
of electromagnetic ﬁeld in T µν declares it as a source for gravitational ﬁeld which is an
assumption but not a prediction.

Resuming, we can say that we have eliminated the need for extra dimensions and
additional ﬁelds for proposing uniﬁed model of electromagnetism and gravitation by
formulating a new geometry. This approach can be useful for formulating a uniﬁed
electroweak model without Higgs ﬁelds and for unifying strong interactions with the
other ones.
